The discount to NAV of ETHE has decreased, indicating a closing gap between the Trust's price and the price of its Ethereum holdings. Ethereum tends to outperform Bitcoin during ""Altseason,"" and history suggests we are nearing one now. Thesis Summary Greyscales’ Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ) has skyrocketed close to 40% in the last two days. No, this is not a meme stock, and it has a perfectly reasonable explanation. The Ethereum (ETH-USD) ETF could be near, which is why we have seen the discount to NAV close down. For those of us holding ETHE it has been a welcome development, but despite this big rally, this is not the time to take profit, yet. With Bitcoin (BTC-USD) potentially reaching new highs soon, it’s only a matter of time before altcoins, and Ethereum begin to catch a bid. In fact, this seems very likely given historical behavior. I actually expect Ethereum to outperform Bitcoin in the coming months. The ETHE Rally Explained A few months back, the Bitcoin ETF was approved, which did not actually spark a huge rally as many expected, but did serve to all but eliminate the discount to NAV of the Trust. GBTC discount to NAV (Ycharts) Due to the fact that GBTC was not an actual ETF, it could not arbitrage the difference between its actual price and the price of its actual BTC holdings. But this changed with the ETF approval. Now, we are seeing the same happen with ETHE. ETHE Discount to NAV (Ycharts) The ETHE discount to NAV has closed down in the last couple of days, going from over 20% to 11%. According to recent news , the SEC has asked prospective ETF applicants to update 19b-4 filings. While this does not necessarily mean the Ethereum ETF will be approved, it does seem to suggest that the SEC is considering it, or else it would probably not be asking for funds to update these documents. I believe it has been this key development which has contributed towards closing down the ETHE discount. This, paired with a nice move in Ethereum’s price has led to a 40% rally in only two days. ETHE chart (TV) ETHE, and Ethereum, are close to new all-time highs, and I think there’s a lot more juice left to squeeze here, even if the discount has almost been eliminated. Ethereum’s Time to Shine Since Ethereum took its place as the second-largest cryptocurrency, the ETH vs BTC debate has been a point of contention in every Cycle. ETHBTC (TV) Over the last two years, BTC has actually been outperforming Ethereum, which is reflected in the ETHBTC chart shown above. However, we could argue that we have a nice cup and handle patterns projecting us up. In any case, Ethereum tends to outperform Bitcoin during “Altseason”, which is when altcoins, Ethereum included, outperform Bitcoin. This has happened in every cycle BTC Price/Dominance (X) In fact, this tends to happen as Bitcoin breaks above its previous highs. We can see this in the chart above, where we have the Bitcoin price, and below, Bitcoin dominance. Just as BTC breaks above its previous highs in 2017, BTC dominance begins to fall, which means Altcoins are gaining market share out of the total crypto market. In other words, Altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. BTC Price/Dominance (X) We see the same story in 2020. ETHBTC (TV) I’ve marked these dates on the ETHBTC chart too, and as we can see they also mark a reversal in the ETHBTC price. BTC Price (TV) Technically, we have already broken above the precious highs, but we haven’t yet done so in an impulsive rally. This is ultimately what I expect to happen. Bitcoin breaks well above the 70K range and, in doing so, sparks another major rally in altcoins. Should You Buy ETHE? With that said, is ETHE the best bet right now? As the price stands today, there is still some money to be made from the discount window closing further. However, it is likely that some of the new ETFs that might be approved will have lower fees than the GBTC ETF. In reality, the best way to gain exposure to Ethereum now would be to buy Ethereum directly, which can be done through an exchange like Coinbase (COIN). This would give you full control of Ethereum, if you move the coin to a private wallet, and could even give you the option of staking the Ethereum , which would then allow you to generate yield. Final Thoughts In conclusion, I think now is a good time to buy crypto, and more specifically some of the altcoins. Ethereum is perhaps the most reliable of these, and I expect it to outperform Bitcoin. However, buying ETHE now may not be the best way to gain exposure. Personally, I will hold on to my ETHE positions, but may look to add more Ethereum to my crypto wallet.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4694887-ethe-40-percent-rally-on-etf-hopes-time-to-buy?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/28239713.jpeg

The hacker behind the breach subsequently sold 592 million GALA tokens, amounting to $21.8 million in value, as blockchain analysis firm Lookonchain confirmed. CEO Of Gala Games Takes Responsibility For Breach Gala Games responded to the breach, assuring the community via social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that the security incident involving the GALA token had been contained and that the affected wallet had been frozen. The company acknowledged the isolated nature of the incident and stated that it had addressed the cause while collaborating closely with law enforcement agencies to investigate the individuals responsible for the breach. Related Reading: Crypto Market Liquidations Top $330 Million In 24 Hours With Ethereum In The Lead Eric Schiermeyer, CEO of Gala Games, expressed his regret over the incident, referencing his previous stance on projects experiencing hacks. Schiermeyer disclosed that the breach led to the unauthorized sale of 600 million GALA tokens, equivalent to $21 million, and the subsequent burning of 4.4 billion tokens. Within 45 minutes, Gala Games identified the compromise and effectively secured and removed unauthorized access to the GALA contract. Reassuring stakeholders, Schiermeyer emphasized that the Ethereum (ETH) contract for GALA remained secure and protected by a multi-signature (multi-sig) wallet, with no compromise detected. Acknowledging internal control shortcomings, Schiermeyer also admitted responsibility for the incident and outlined the steps being taken to prevent its recurrence. Gala Games expressed confidence in identifying the culprit behind the breach. They confirmed active collaboration with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Department of Justice (DOJ), and a network of international authorities to ensure appropriate legal actions are pursued. The incident raised concerns regarding the project’s daily distribution, prompting Gala Games to propose a node vote to address the issue. As per their community-driven approach, the decision on how to proceed will be determined by the community itself. DFW Labs Support In response to the incident, DFW Labs, a Web3 investor and market maker, took action to alleviate selling pressure in the market. They purchased 28 million GALA tokens from the open market to stabilize the value of the token, which had fallen to $0.037 on Monday following the exploit. However, with the investment from DFW Labs, the token rebounded to its current trading price of $0.0431, representing a loss of 7.8% in the last 24 hours.

42418150,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTchhd,1716332381,Cboe Publishes Amended Spot Ether ETF Filings as Industry Renews Approval Hopes,"Things appear to be moving ahead of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) decision to potentially approve an important filing related to the launch of a spot ether {{ETH}} exchange-traded fund (ETF).  Cboe, an exchange associated with five of the issuers of a potential spot ether exchange-traded fund (ETF), published its amended 19b-4 filings in response to feedback from regulators. The applicants include Fidelity, VanEck, Invesco/Galaxy, Ark/21Shares and Franklin Templeton.  Exchanges supporting various applicants filed revised forms with the SEC earlier on Tuesday, two individuals familiar with the situation told CoinDesk.  Officials with the SEC asked exchanges to refile using universal comments – where they all use the same wording – one individual told CoinDesk.  Several people told CoinDesk across Monday and Tuesday that SEC officials haven't explicitly said they were approving the applications, but that the feedback was still significant. A final approval on the applications is still not guaranteed, but the agency asking for revisions on the 19b-4 forms suggests progress is being made. One of the individuals told CoinDesk they expect multiple approvals this week.  While the 19b-4 forms might be approved as soon as this Thursday – when the first one, an application by VanEck and Cboe, faces a final deadline – the spot ether ETFs can't launch until the SEC also approves the S-1 forms filed by the issuers themselves. There appears to be less movement on this front than with the 19b-4 filings. A few applicants have already begun revising their S-1 forms, however.  It appears that the SEC won’t allow issuers to stake the potential ETFs, which several applicants, including Grayscale and Fidelity, hoped to do. Both asset managers on Tuesday filed an amended S-1 registration statement removing staking from their documents.  Ether's price traded around $3,790 as of press time according to CoinGecko, up 3.8% over the last 24 hours and maintaining a $600 jump from its price on Monday before optimism for an ETF approval first resurfaced.",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,"Helene Braun, Nikhilesh De",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/05/21/cboe-publishes-amended-spot-ether-etf-filings-as-industry-renews-approval-hopes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9d2adf9787c1aac04287e554798444dd2dcb2604-6000x3376.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

They alluded to the likelihood of Ethereum rising higher as another reason SOL will likely “soar.” Solana To Make A 90% Move Against Ethereum Happel and Allemann, through their shared X account (@Negentropic), highlighted a “clear Cup and Handle pattern” on the SOLETH chart, which suggests Solana will move 90% from its current price level. They also noted that the SOLETH ratio has been consolidating for some time now and looks ready for such a move to the upside. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Mirrors Historical Pattern That Led To $1,200 Surge, Will History Repeat Itself? Meanwhile, they also predict SOL will soar because they expect Ethereum “to move much higher.” Therefore, a rally for the second-largest crypto token could also spark a significant move for Solana. Interestingly, this move already looks to be in play, seeing that SOL enjoyed up to a 7% price gain on the back of Ethereum’s price rally in the last 24 hours. Therefore, Solana could rise higher as ETH continues to enjoy an upward trend following reports that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could approve the pending Spot Ethereum ETF applications. A 90% move for Solana means the crypto token could come close to its current all-time high (ATH) of $260. Crypto analyst Javon Marks had before now predicted that SOL could make such a move, noting that a price gain of 54% may already be in the pipeline. He further claimed that Solana achieving this price move would open up room for another price rally of 93%, which would send SOL’s price to $453. How High Can SOL Rise In This Bull Run? Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa has predicted that Solana could rise to as high as $500 by year-end, while crypto analyst Hansolar predicts that Solana could hit $600 in this market cycle. Crypto YouTuber Jake Gagain offered a more bullish prediction, stating that Solana will rise to $750, although he predicts that will happen next year. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Incoming: This Major BTC Metric Just Turned Bullish Once Again Interstingly, Hansolar claimed that SOL could be the new Ethereum in this cycle. ETH is known to have been one of the biggest gainers in the last bull run, with its price more than tripling on its way to its current ATH of $4,891. Ethereum’s run then was thanks to its decentralized finance (DeFi) utility, with many DeFi projects utilizing the network. Asset manager Franklin Templeton suggested that Solana will onboard the projects that will drive the next wave of crypto adoption. Therefore, Solana could undoubtedly enjoy the kind of run Ethereum did in 2021. This explains why the asset manager is bullish on SOL’s growth, as they predict it will eventually become the third-largest crypto token after Bitcoin and Ethereum.

42418159,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTchnp,1716326252,Ether Rally Prompts Over $300 Million ETH Inflow to Crypto Exchanges: Nansen,"Ether {{ETH}} holders are sending assets to crypto exchanges at the fastest pace in almost four months following the crypto's rally on increasing anticipation of a U.S. spot exchange-traded fund approval.  Blockchain data by Nansen Intelligence shows Tuesday net inflows to exchanges reached 81,840 ETH worth roughly $306 million at current prices, the highest amount in a day since January 23.  Tuesday was also the third day in a row of inflows, marking a break from the general trend of decreasing ETH balance on exchanges, Nansen data shows. The last time ETH experienced consecutive days of inflows to exchanges was in March, near this year's peak in crypto prices.  Moving assets to exchanges usually signal intention to sell, while traders normally withdraw tokens from platforms if they want to hold onto the purchases for a longer term.  Soaring inflows could signal short-term profit-taking after ETH surged to over $3,800 from around $3,000 in a day, noted David Shuttleworth, research partner at Anagram.  ""My sense is [that] individuals are capturing a quick 30% price increase that occurred in less than 24 hours,"" Shuttleworth said in a direct message on X.  The rally happened as odds for a U.S. regulatory nod for spot ETH ETFs jumped almost overnight with regulators asking issuers to update their applications after months of lack of engagement.

Here’s a few options for those looking to make the most of Austin’s famous nightlife at Consensus on May 30.  Grab your tickets to Consensus 2024, hosted in Austin, Texas from May 29-31.  It’s five o’clock in Austin, so you know what that means: an open bar on Rainey Street hosted by crypto industry defenders the Digital Chamber of Commerce and Texas Blockchain Council. The event will run from 5 p.m. - 7 p.m., so swing by – it’s just a short walk over from the Austin Convention Center.  For those who can’t talk enough politics, early bitcoin investor and market commentator Bruce W. Porter is hosting another one of his “Washington Elite” Galas, from 5:30 p.m. to midnight. While John Deaton, who is running to replace Elizabeth Warren in the U.S. Senate, is hosting a fundraiser at the Hilton Austin (Meeting Room 406). Although tickets start at $100, crypto luminaries Anthony Scaramucci, Wendy O, The Wolf of All Streets, among others, are hosting the event.  Perhaps the most anticipated after hours event is the scheduled boxing match between Bankless co-founder David Hoffman and Castle Island Venture partner Nic Carter, at the Austin Convention Center. While Crypto Twitter eagerly awaits the fight between the two avatars of Bitcoin and Ethereum, Carter and Hoffman’s fight is actually part of a larger series called Karate Combat, which will feature a number of martial arts including IFC, Karate and grappling. Tickets are limited, doors open at 5 p.m.  See also: What Consensus Speakers Are Looking Forward to This Year  After that, anyone in need of some intellectual stimulation should check out the “Read, Write, Own” VIP Networking Party, hosted by ARSENAL. The first 50 guests will get a free copy of the recently published book of the same name, written by a16z’s Chris Dixon, who is not a confirmed guest.  Looking for food options? Consider the “DeFi Happy Hour + BBQ Party” at Cooper's Old Time BBQ, hosted by the good folks from Halborn, Core, SphereX, Flipside & Conflux. Or for something a little more formal, you can apply to attend the invite-only 3MO Dinner, at the lovely, contemporary Mexican haunt Suerte in East Austin.  Then for some truly late night fun, get your disco on at hypercool media brand Boys Club’s second annual “Hoedown,” co-hosted by dYdX & Everest Ventures Group. Cowboy/girl getup is strongly encouraged. Finally, another event designed for degens: “THE MEMECOIN PARTY,” hosted by the folks behind the $RFKJ token, an hommage to the pro-crypto presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (who will be speaking at Consensus this year).  *Note that this is a list of all events happening in Austin around Consensus.

Bitcoin VWAP Oscillator Suggests BTC Rally Only Halfway Done In a new post on X, analyst Willy Woo has posted an update for how the Bitcoin Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) Oscillator is looking like after the latest rally. The VWAP is an indicator that, as its full form suggests, calculates an average price for the cryptocurrency based on not just the changes in the price over the day but also the volume that was traded at these prices. Related Reading: Litecoin Whales Go On $230 Million Buying Spree: Will This Change LTC’s Stars? Normally, this volume is measured using the spot volume data provided by centralized exchanges. Still, in the case of Bitcoin, the blockchain is available for anyone to explore, so on-chain volume is used to calculate the VWAP instead. The VWAP Oscillator, which is the actual metric of interest here, takes the ratio between the cryptocurrency’s spot price and the VWAP and represents it as an oscillator around zero. Earlier in the month, Woo had pointed out how the Bitcoin VWAP Oscillator was forming a bullish divergence for the asset. As is visible in the chart, the Bitcoin VWAP Oscillator climbed up inside the negative territory after forming an apparent bottom back then. At the same time, the cryptocurrency’s price had been heading down instead. In the past, such a setup has proven to be bullish for the coin, and the resulting bullish momentum usually lasts until the VWAP Oscillator tops out in positive territory. As such, the analyst remarked that the coin had a lot of room to run back then. Since then, the price has experienced a recovery rally, potentially suggesting that the bullish divergence may be paying off. As Woo pointed out, the indicator has returned to the neutral mark after this run. Based on the fact that tops in the past have occurred after the metric peaks in the positive territory and based on the scale of these peaks usually, the analyst concludes, “this Bitcoin move is now at the halfway mark.” Related Reading: Bulls In Control: Ethereum Longs See Biggest Candle Ever After ETF News As for how things could play out next, the analyst says, Consolidation under all-time-high needs to happen for a little, then we see if the second leg gives us escape velocity to new highs which will open up the flood gates. Woo has also shared a “risk signal” for Bitcoin, which shows where the asset is when looking at the bigger picture. BTC may be in that part of the cycle where risk begins to drive up as price reacts violently to capital inflows. “That’s where most of the fast gains happen,” notes the analyst. BTC Price Bitcoin had recovered above $71,000 earlier in the day, but the asset appears to have seen a pullback since then, as it’s now back below $70,000.

42418169,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTchjh,1716323839,What Consensus Speakers Are Looking Forward to This Year,"Some of the leading minds of Generation Crypto are heading to Austin, Texas at the end of the month for Consensus 2024. Here are a few of the things they are most excited about, including everything from a dedicated AI track to the many, many side events and afterparties.  CFTC Commissioner Summer Mersinger:  The conversations with so many different stakeholders. This is an opportunity to talk with people we ordinarily wouldn’t see in Washington, D.C. and to have them all in one place is really special.  CEO of the Foresight Institute Allison Duettmann:  I’m really looking forward to discovering what the state of crypto and AI has really come to at this point. I come at it from the foundational research side of things or more on the kind of cryptography and security side of things. But I also know that many people have been really building hard in the Web3 and AI space. So, I'm really interested to see which of my hypotheses — or which of other people's hypotheses — have come out. Who's building what right now? And where are there possible synergies across different products? I’m excited to see what’s happening in that space.  Alethea CEO Arif Khan:  Wilser: Any favorite memories from past conferences?  Consensys Director of Global Regulatory Matters Bill Hughes:  To tease our panel for Consensus, the news just came out that apparently Uniswap received a Wells Notice. I think it is safe to predict that this is the first shot in the new front of the war against crypto for the SEC. And so by the time our panel rolls around, we're probably going to have a sizable chunk of SEC related news that me and the other panelists will be able to really sink our teeth into.  Crypto lawyer Fatemeh Fannizadeh:  Fannizadeh: Many things! It’ll actually be my first time and I'm very excited. We're almost a month away and I’ve already heard of many interesting events lined up and have meetings organized – I can’t wait to just get together with the attendees, I heard the crowd is excellent. I usually go to very specific community centric or legal and policy conferences. But Consensus is so comprehensive, right? It seems like a platform where we can reach “consensus,” discuss things with very different actors all in one place.  SHRAPNEL CEO Mark Long:  Long: It’s a really well-curated conference. I would call it a scholarly conference, where the panels are well-vetted.  CCO at the Sandbox Game Nicola Sabastini:  Many of the panels. I’m blown away by the quality of the speakers that are there. In fact, I wonder what I'm doing there compared to them.  Early bitcoin investor, Otoh  Well, meeting Bobby Lee and Charlie Lee again. They both in their own ways have been very instrumental in helping me with my crypto journey. Charlie Lee by inventing Litecoin, where I did extremely well – probably even better than I did with bitcoin. And Bobby Lee for having BTCC (also known as BTCChina) and the physical coins. He produced physical coins just like Mike's Casascius coins. I have still got all my BTCC coins. That will be a future auction.  Web3 Artist Shavonne Wong:  Wilser: You’ll be joining us at Consensus at the AI Summit. As an artist, how are you thinking about AI?  Gauntlet CEO Tarun Chitra:  Chitra: Doing another live podcast.

(Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is running for president as an independent, has been accepting crypto donations for months.)  Trump's move comes weeks after the former president declared himself crypto’s candidate at a Mar-a-Lago gala that thrust crypto into the 2024 campaign.  Trump's campaign said in a statement it ""will build a crypto army"" to combat the infamous ""anti-crypto army"" that Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has campaigned on.  While Trump has yet to propose any concrete crypto policies, supporters of his positioning are accepting the positive noises as enough. That's largely because Joe Biden's administration has taken a sharply anti-crypto stance in the past.  Crypto's emergence as a bona-fide campaign issue may be changing Democrats' calculation, as evidenced in the House Democratic leadership's decision in the last 24 hours not to push its members against an upcoming bill on crypto policy.

However, the current leg up is just the beginning for Willy Woo, an on-chain analyst. Bitcoin Rally Getting Started: Analyst Taking to X, Woo, who has been maintaining a bullish outlook for the world’s most valuable coin, boldly asserts that the current Bitcoin rally is only halfway through its welcomed bullish journey. Sharing a chart, the on-chain analyst notes that the Bitcoin VWAP oscillator just bottomed up from oversold territory and is now at the zero mark, which is midway. Though Woo is upbeat and expecting even more gains, the analyst didn’t specify when or at what level prices will peak. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Breaks Out Of Bull Flag Pattern-Like, Signaling Uptrend Even so, the analyst explained that a period of consolidation below the all-time high is necessary. Woo says this consolidation might allow users to accumulate before a “second leg” propels the Bitcoin to new heights. Looking at the Bitcoin daily chart, this “second leg” is expected to be a breakout moment that will lift the coin above March highs. At press time, Bitcoin is still in a bullish formation. The uptick above $68,000 and last week’s high were crucial for trend definition. Moreover, since the May 20 breakout bar is wide-ranging and has a high trading volume, the odds of trend continuation are high. If bulls follow through, confirming May 20 gains, BTC will likely break $73,800, aligning with Woo’s forecast. BTC Bull Run To Last 300 Days If There Is No Black Swan Event Besides Woo, another analyst says the Bitcoin uptrend is in full swing. Sharing a chart, the trader said that barring any unforeseen disruptions, such as the impact of a major exchange going bankrupt, it is highly likely that the current bull run will extend for another 300 days. This prediction is based on profit and loss analysis of short-term holders (STHs) with a 90-day moving average. Currently, the STH is moving lower but is relatively higher. Analysts use the STH to determine market sentiment from short-term price movements and trader speculations. Related Reading: Why Is The Ethereum Price Up 20% Today? As sentiment improves and prices recover, the pace at which the coin edges higher will depend on external factors. Besides the impact of the United States Federal Reserve and their monetary policy declaration, inflow to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will be crucial.

42418142,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTchcT,1716321204,How a Liquidity Protocol Marketer Mines Web3’s ‘Most Sacred Data’,"When marketer Yakov Sychev joinedcross-chain liquidity protocol Eywa a month before its launch in November 2023, he was shocked to discover that there “were no really good tools” to measure how users interacted with blockchain contracts. Through Eywa’s cross-chain index, CrossCurve, users swap tokens across different chains — a layer Sychev, now Eywa’s Chief Marketing Officer, says “was getting neglected before I saw Cookie3.”  This interview is part of CoinDesk's Web3 Marketing Week.  A MarketingFi company, Cookie3 “is basically Google Analytics for Web3,” Sychev says, where Eywa’s users value anonymity and decentralization above all. To attract and retain these customers while giving them the power and privacy Web3 has to offer, Sychev needed to figure out the user journey without relying on Web2 analytics. How were users getting to Eywa’s products? What partners could Eywa work with to entice new ones?  Cookie3 could answer these questions without revealing any information that’s not already on the blockchain. “They’re giving me the format and tools to read this data in a way that doesn’t require a developer,” Sychev says. “As a marketer, I don't want to be writing code.” Cookie3 translates the blockchain into marketing speak for him.  What work were you doing before becoming CMO at Eywa?  I was working on a crypto accounting app that was in between Web2 and Web3. We used a lot of Web2 tools and didn't need Web3 analytics. Before that, I was mostly working on Web2 projects, including automation for educational webinars. We needed to connect incoming traffic to its sources, like a Telegram username to that user’s actions in a webinar room.  We built funnels that showed users’ journeys and automated them. We could see how many were on different stages of the funnel and how many minutes the user was on the webinar. You could see, for example, if a customer went through a bot to a webinar, or from a Facebook ad.  How do those funnels look different in Web3?  I started to understand how different they are with the Eywa project. With Web3, you have another layer of data in the blockchain. Users don't just interact with your websites or systems in-house. They interact with your blockchain contracts by buying, selling, or swapping tokens.  Before Cookie3, I couldn’t measure the quality of the audience or the metrics on blockchain. I could see how people went to my website through Web2 analytics tools, but I couldn’t see what people were doing on-chain, which is the most sacred data in Web3 projects. On-chain data is very valuable to investors. It shows how much you're growing.  Of course, you have specific tools for blockchain analytics. But the problem was I would see 1000-plus wallets, but I didn’t know what channels brought them to us. I didn't know the quality of these wallets — how many tokens they’re holding or how many transactions they’ve made. You couldn’t see how off-chain actions transitioned users on-chain. As a marketer, you need to understand that.  How is Cookie3 providing that information?  I can give you an example. We were participating in a Cookie3 ecosystem campaign, a drop with a couple projects. Their website had a link to our website, which I provided and had basic parameters like those in Google Analytics. We were using Cookie3 before we integrated in this campaign, so when users got to our page with this link, I could see how many wallets were connected through it. The key is I can see how many wallets this source — the Cookie3 ecosystem campaign — brings me.  That just scratches the surface. I can go deeper. Cookie3 has an on-chain explorer, where I can see the overview of the wallets that interacted with our smart contracts. I can see the transaction count. Then I can go deeper and investigate the quality of those wallets. Is it better than what I see from other partners? Worse? This has helped me identify and compare different channels, bloggers, KOLs, influencers — all the sources I'm using to bring in traffic. It also adds a new layer — ID, the wallet.  Through that drop, Eywa users could get free Cookie3 token airdrop points for their engagement with Eywa’s products. How did users earn points?  It’s easy to track the wallet addresses that interacted with our contract, so we shared those addresses with Cookie3. They let those wallets claim airdrop points for past interactions. Each user who made even one transaction cross-chain could get points.  For present interactions, we have our smart contracts configured in Cookie3. Working with Cookie3, I don't need a developer. I have some data from the developer side, like which contract to use, and then I can configure everything myself through Cookie3, which I did a couple months ago. Now, Cookie3 is tracking all the interactions with our smart contracts.  How many airdrop points have Eywa users collected so far?  I don’t have that data. But I checked my own address, and I could claim 2,500 points for interacting with Eywa contracts. Users will get the points-to-tokens conversion rate later.  What have been the most valuable insights you've learned with Cookie3?  We’re acquiring an audience that’s interested in our product category. They’re not coming from NFTs or GameFi, but exchanges or DeFi protocols — our competitors — as a source. Lots of users come from different Dapps, so I know the exact Dapps they use. That helps me know who to approach for partnerships.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | AIRDROP,Jessica Klein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/05/21/how-a-liquidity-protocol-marketer-mines-web3s-most-sacred-data,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/aca5c97d61741e4ad4619d65b0e45d40457c3730-3840x2160.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42418158,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTchmn,1716320193,Several U.S. House Democrats Petition Colleagues to Join Yes Side on Crypto Bill,"Eight House Democrats signed onto a memo arguing in favor of a largely Republican-driven bill to establish U.S. regulations over the crypto markets.  The U.S. House is set for a final vote on the first major crypto legislation, and approval would send it to a murky fate in the Senate.  The U.S. House of Representatives is on the verge of a vote on Wednesday that is widely expected to approve comprehensive cryptocurrency legislation with bipartisan support – a major milestone for the industry – and several Democrats there are pushing their colleagues to vote yes.  At least eight House Democrats were vocally supporting the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) – and they may recruit more – according to a memo shared with CoinDesk by a congressional aide. At this point, the bill is scheduled for floor discussion and a vote later in the day on Wednesday.  ""As Democrats, we feel this is a crucial opportunity to regulate the digital asset markets,"" the eight lawmakers wrote in the internal memo Tuesday asking support from their colleagues. ""This should not be a partisan issue,"" according to the lawmakers, including Reps. Wiley Nickel (D-N.C.), Yadira Caraveo (D-Colo.), Jim Himes (D-Conn.), Jasmine Crockett (D-Tex.), Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.), Darren Soto (D-Fla.), Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) and Don Davis (D-N.C.).  But despite fans on both sides of the aisle in the House, the effort further highlights the lack of similar progress in the Senate, where the crypto market-structure legislation could fizzle. To that end, senior staff of the House Financial Services and Agriculture committees working on the bill said Tuesday that they're having increasing discussions with Senate counterparts but are also open to legislative vehicles the bill could eventually be attached to as this congressional session winds toward its close.  ""What we want is to have a substantial vote total this week in the House that will show momentum,"" said Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee who has shepherded the bill in the retiring lawmaker's final months in Congress. He lamented to reporters on Tuesday that the effort that was meant to happen almost a year ago was delayed this long. ""We're now in May of an election year.""  Still, he said his fellow lawmakers now have an ""awareness"" of the existence of crypto voters, too, and ""that is supportive of our efforts.""  FIT21 would establish a clear framework for digital assets in the U.S., identifying where and how each token and exchange might be regulated. It establishes consumer protections, disclosures and addresses the use of crypto in illicit finance. The vote on the bill represents the first time such a comprehensive piece of crypto legislation has reached a final decision in either chamber of Congress.  Read More: Crypto Industry Rallies Behind House Bill as It Heads Toward Final Vote  The Democratic advocates made a case for stepping in to police the crypto markets, where the leading businesses are waging a multi-front legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over how much authority that regulator rightfully has. The lawmakers also argued that the U.S. is falling behind other jurisdictions that have already instituted rules for the industry.  ""Roughly 20% of Americans have invested, traded, or used crypto, so it’s not going anywhere,"" according to the Democrats' memo. ""Meanwhile, Congress hasn’t passed legislation to usher in this new generation of internet technology responsibly.""  The House's digital assets legislation isn't yet facing any White House promises for a veto, unlike the recent vote in the Senate that saw a large number of Democrats join all the Republicans to approve a resolution to reverse an SEC crypto account policy – Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121).  Republican aides said they expect some of the same 21 Democratic names who voted in the House to overturn SAB 121 might also support this bill.  FIT21 has previously cleared its two relevant House committees with some Democratic support.  House Financial Services Committee Ranking Member Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and House Agriculture Committee Ranking Member David Scott (D-Ga.) – the leading Democrats on their respective panels – sent their own email to fellow Democrats saying they still ""strongly oppose"" the effort. While the House Democratic Whip isn't organizing votes against the bill, Waters is.  Consumer advocates including Americans for Financial Reform argued against the bill, too, saying it didn't sufficiently protect consumers and uses an ""easily manipulated definition"" of decentralization when deciding how things should be regulated.  Rep. Glenn ""G.T."" Thompson (R-Pa.), chairman of the Agriculture Committee, told reporters that passing legislation is urgent, because the current state of regulation has driven crypto business away from the U.S.  ""Right now, most of them are parked somewhere offshore, because the only regulatory structure they see is regulation by enforcement,"" he said.  In the Senate, a wide-ranging bill from Sens. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) is currently the closest equivalent to FIT21, and the House aides said that talks are underway about the topics on which those bills find common ground.  Rashan Colbert, head of policy at dYdX Trading and a former legislative assistant to Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), noted that the bill has been working its way through the House for a year and a half.  ""[For] the Senate to take this up, [starting] with the committee process to go through, that would be needed to really consider this bill in full,"" he said. ""So unfortunately, I think that there's not a great chance of Senate consideration this Congress.""  One of the key components to iron out would be funding the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which would have a much more significant and defined role in policing the crypto spot markets but currently has a tiny fraction of its sister agency's budget.

This development signals a bullish sentiment among these investors which could trigger a Bitcoin rally to $80,000. Bitcoin Investment Funds Record $942 Million In Inflows According to CoinShares’ latest weekly report, Bitcoin investment products recorded a net inflow of $942 million. These inflows are said to have been “an immediate response to the lower-than-expected CPI report on Wednesday,” with 89% of the total flows coming in the latter three trading days of last week. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Sounds Warning Alarm For Potential 50-60% Crash In Chainlink Price, Here’s Why The Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data, which came in lower than expected, is believed to have restored investors’ confidence in the market. The data showed that inflation in the US may be slowing, raising the prospect of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates. Lower interest rates are good for the crypto market since they will make investors more willing to invest in risk assets like Bitcoin. The US accounted for most of the inflows into BTC, with $1 billion flowing into US Spot Bitcoin ETFs last week. Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which has recorded over $16 billion in outflows since the ETF approval in January, also saw inflows (for the first time) of $18 million last week. This trend of significant inflows into these Spot Bitcoin ETFs likely continues this week. Farside investors revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that these funds recorded a net inflow of $237.2 million on May 20. Interestingly, none of these Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw outflows on the day, with GBTC recording an inflow of $9.3 million. It is also worth noting that while BTC saw inflows of $942 million, there were almost no flows into short Bitcoin, with CoinShares noting that this implies a positive outlook amongst investors. Altcoins like Solana, Chainlink, and Cardano also recorded considerable inflows, with $4.9 million, $3.7 million, and $1.9 million flowing into these crypto tokens, respectively. BTC’s Bull Run Might Be Back On With the Spot Bitcoin ETFs again seeing impressive demand and recording significant inflows, there is a feeling that Bitcoin’s bull run might be in full force. These investment funds were known to have contributed significantly to the flagship crypto’s hitting a new all-time high (ATH) of $73,750 in March.

Besides the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, other factors contribute to a bullish continuation for BTC. One is the macroeconomic data, which shows that the economic situation in the US could be improving.

42418135,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTchaP,1716317084,CFTC Commissioner Summer Mersinger on Overzealous Crypto Regulation and the Need for Legislative Action,"Commissioner Summer Mersinger, of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), is one of the few U.S. regulators who is routinely willing to defend the crypto industry and call out what she sees as overzealous oversight. She will be speaking at Consensus 2024 in Austin, Texas, on May 30.  CoinDesk caught up with Mersinger to discuss the Cain and Abel rivalry between the CFTC and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), how her agency decides which enforcement actions to pursue and her views on a variety of issues, including the CME possibly getting into the spot bitcoin market, the emerging world of betting markets and Washington D.C. traffic.  Is it an accurate view that the SEC and the CFTC are in somewhat of a turf war over crypto?  I think there are certainly questions around who has the appropriate authority. There are people between the two agencies who are willing to work together, in fact, at Consensus Commissioner Peirce and I will be speaking together. We have some similar views. But it is a struggle because, sometimes where debate has been leveled – whether it's an enforcement case or another action we have said falls under our fraud and manipulation enforcement authority – we're seeing the SEC start to ask questions as though it falls under their jurisdiction. And so there is certainly some tension there. It’s largely the lack of clarity that's really causing the tension.  You're in a minority position as a regulator who’s somewhat favorable to crypto. Could you just explain why it is that you're willing to stick your neck out?  Part of the reason I went into government, generally, is that – while there's a need for government in people's lives – we don't want to overstep. We also want to make sure the rules of the road are clear so that people can abide by the law. This is an area where there is a real problem. A lot of people are very interested in investing in, or trading, cryptocurrencies, and we have not provided any clarity – we've made it very murky. That's not what the government should be doing. It’s creating a situation where you have people relying on the word of a regulator, and the rules of the game are being changed in the middle of the play.  I still think it's important that we speak up and let people know that, whether you like crypto or not, that's not the point here. The point is that regulators have really made this confusing and difficult.  Do you agree with Commissioner Pham’s idea that the Government Accountability Office should investigate the CFTC's enforcement actions?  COMMISSIONER MERSINGER: It’s difficult to ask another agency to come in and look at the internal workings of the CFTC. I understand where Commissioner Pham is coming from and I think it's that same kind of feeling that we shouldn't be regulating through enforcement. But I also think this is a leadership question. I greatly respect Chairman Behnam, but this is an issue with the political direction from this White House. So, instead of an audit, we need to ask: Is the problem the agency, or the current political leadership driving our agenda and broadly stifling financial innovation?  I don't want to put words in your mouth, but is this to suggest that the regulatory landscape would improve if Trump was re-elected in November?  There are clear differences between President Biden and former President Trump, so that does drive the regulatory agenda. So, if leadership changes, you would certainly assume there would be new policies and a new regulatory agenda.  I'm curious to what extent you're in active dialogue with Congressmembers about potential crypto legislation?  They use us as a resource. We talk to members of the House Financial Services Committee, the Agriculture Committee, and certainly members of the Senate and work with them on where there is ambiguity in the laws or opportunities to make some delineations and clear paths for regulation. It’s offering our assistance and expertise and it’s helpful to have those conversations because they also want to make sure we're able to implement the laws that they pass. They may have great intentions, but if it's impossible for the agency to implement then it’s useless.  That makes a lot of sense. Do you think that there needs to be bespoke crypto legislation or would new interpretations of existing laws suffice?  There are some who believe we can use current statutory authority, whether the SEC or the CFTC, to regulate – which is where we see regulation through enforcement actions. I disagree. The only way to get past just bringing enforcement actions is to have something come out of Congress that says “here's how to handle cryptocurrencies.”  See also: The Biden Administration Is Easing Up on Crypto (a Vibes Analysis)  Beyond legislation, the two agencies also need to sit down and come up with some joint rulemaking. We did that with Dodd Frank, and we certainly could do that here. That’s an important piece of making sure people know which regulator is going to regulate them, which door to walk into. There's no question that without statutory changes to ensure it's very clear where the jurisdiction is, agencies will try to go in separate directions.  I know every enforcement action is primarily driven by facts on the ground. But I think it might be interesting to get a view into how these cases are built. What is the process of building a case against someone like Avi Eisenberg?  Without talking about any specific enforcement cases, with a lot of these cases it's been whistleblower reports saying “I think somebody is violating the law.” It could be a victim who says they lost money, and I don't think what they're doing is legal. We have a pretty large team of enforcement investigators and attorneys who start building a case. By the time it gets to us at the commission, usually the facts have been pretty well established and how they line up with the law. We're kind of like a jury that decides whether the facts meet our statutory requirements.  A lot of it is done by the enforcement team that might interview the whistleblower and other employees, get documents. A lot of time goes into each case before it gets to the commission for a vote. There's also a lot of cooperation between the various agencies, whether it's the DOJ, state regulators or the SEC. So where there's opportunities to bring cases under multiple statutes, or different regulators, they'll work together. It's more efficient for the government if they can work together. They can also tip each other off. If we had to get every lead, I think it'd be really difficult.  Now one distinction I want to make is you hear a lot of numbers around crypto enforcement cases. I think it's a little unfair because a lot of these cases are just run of the mill fraud; somebody stealing someone else's money, someone claiming to buy crypto, but not actually buying the crypto. So we've seen this play out with whatever the hot topic is at the time. I'd say every few years the theme changes – it was foreign currencies, it was metals, we saw a lot of gold fraud. Right now crypto is the hot thing. A lot of cases have been portrayed as cryptocurrency fraud, but it's just fraud with a crypto wrapper around it. So tomorrow, it might be AI fraud.  I almost hate to say it, but given how much fraud centers around crypto, do you think that there should be more enforcement actions?  I think when it's straight up fraud, yes. There's a distinction here when you have a case where somebody just takes your money and claims to invest in something and never does – there's no question who has the authority there. The more we can try to shut some of this down, the better.  But where there's a policy question around a certain activity and how our statute would fit with that activity, that's where I get a little nervous. For instance, if we're looking at a DeFi protocol, and we're saying they're violating our statute it can be difficult if we've never really said how our statute applies to DeFi.  We’re starting to set out definitions and interpretations based on court cases, because sometimes you'll find use cases where there are bad actors. Sometimes it's people who want to abide by the law, but there's no clear way how they would do that. That's why I think we'd be better off with rulemaking.  What do you make of the argument that the SEC implicitly said that Ethereum is a commodity when futures went live in 2021?  So this is an interesting question in development. We do have futures products trading on ether. And I do think if somebody decides that ether is a security, it calls into question what happens. We've [the CFTC] been regulating those contracts. They operated well, we have no concerns. This was an area where we thought there was clarity, and now we're not quite sure if there's clarity and that's dangerous.  The law is a little strange; commodities can be a lot of other things – you can have a commodity that is a security. The nomenclature gets a little tricky the way the law is written. But we've said we believe this is a commodity and we're going to regulate it as such under CFTC jurisdiction because it is a derivative product. To me that has been clearly laid out and we shouldn't be introducing new kinds of questions around what has been a clear policy.  Given how interrelated these assets are, do you think the U.S. would be better off with a single unified agency, like the U.K.’s FCA?  I'm always hesitant to recommend any new government agencies or adding more government. History has shown that more government has never been the answer. But I do think sometimes you've got to better tailor statutes. Crypto doesn't neatly fit into any of our financial categories, so we're gonna have to fine tune some of the law. That's what Congress does, so we can easily do this without any new agency.  Why is the CFTC so against betting markets?  It's a very tough, difficult topic because there's a lot of nuance. So these markets, which we call event contracts, are part of our statute that was added under the Dodd Frank Act. In the grand scheme of things, it's relatively new, but we've seen interest in these contracts for quite some time and it's certainly ramping up. The way Congress laid it out for us it said these contracts generally are OK, as long as they don't touch on a number of topics, like gaming, war, terrorism, assassination – anything that's against federal law. There are a number of people who really don't like election contracts and would like to include them in this list.  Then there's this public interest piece that tries to determine whether having this contract would be against the public interest. It's not necessarily that we are against these markets, but there have to be some guardrails. Congress directed us to have some guardrails, and we’re trying to build them. You see that with our recent vote. My feeling is if that's the route you want to take, you still have to do a public interest determination for every contract, which is why I dissented because we were limiting elections as a category.  See also: 'What Are We Waiting for'? SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce on Crypto Regulation  At the end of the day, we want to create a framework where if you're registered with us, you won’t have a legal question every time you try to do something new. We are just struggling a little bit with the approach. Congress tried to help us create clarity, but certainly left a lot of a lot left to the regulator to figure out.  The Financial Times reported today that CME is thinking about listing spot bitcoin trading, not not just bitcoin futures. Is that something that you are supportive of?  You know, the first time I heard about it was this morning as well, so I haven't had those conversations. I want to talk a little bit more with CME and with our staff to find out what this means. There's a lot of questions around custody and other issues. So right now, I don't have a positive or negative opinion and honestly, as a regulator, I shouldn't. They should be able to make those market decisions as long as they're following the rules. We try to be a regulator that is principles based and let our registered entities run the markets, because that's what they do. Our job is just to make sure everyone's following the rules.  Quick round of overrated/underrated? You could decline to answer or clarify your position. DeFi?  I don't have a position one way or the other. I just think as a regulator, we should have clear rules of the road for DeFi.  Washington D.C.?  You know, I'm gonna say Washington D.C. is a little overrated. Mostly because I was just in the Midwest where there was no traffic. It was very pleasant.  Gary Gensler?  Neutral. You know, I've never met him. So I try to withhold my opinions of people until I've had a chance to sit down and get to know them.  The phrase “sufficiently decentralized?”  You're either decentralized or you're not. So I think sufficiently decentralized feels a little overrated because I don't know what that means. It probably means you're not decentralized.  What are you most looking forward to at Consensus?  The conversations with so many different stakeholders. This is an opportunity to talk with people we ordinarily wouldn’t see in Washington, D.C. and to have them all in one place is really special.

42418183,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTckY9,1716313754,The Biden Administration Is Easing Up on Crypto (a Vibes Analysis),"The Biden administration’s stance on crypto appears to be softening. I feel comfortable saying this, despite the yearslong “whole-of-government” onslaught against the industry, due to a few key advancements in recent weeks.  Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates. This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  First, and perhaps most significantly, Monday’s news that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may be gearing up to approve spot ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This would be a major reversal in fortune for an asset class assumed to be dead-on-arrival, especially considering the securities watchdog has recently been probing prominent Ethereum-related institutions.  While much of this is just speculation, based partially on words heard through the grapevine (i.e. “sources with direct knowledge of the situation”), it is telling that the SEC has asked for amended filings from prospect ETH ETF exchanges on an expedited basis. It would be an odd move if the agency planned to reject these applications outright.  Just yesterday, Bloomberg Intelligence placed the odds of an SEC approval of spot ETH ETFs at 25%. Today, it stands at 75% likely that these products – which would likely draw institutional capital into the second-largest crypto asset by market cap, in the same way bitcoin benefited from its own cluster of ETFs – will launch this year. (The SEC is expected to make a decision on VanEck’s spot ether ETF on May 23.)  Secondly, last week a bipartisan bill called the Deploying American Blockchains Act of 2023 was passed with a margin of 334 to 79 by House representatives. While modest in scope, the bill would enable the Secretary of Commerce, currently Gina Raimondo, “to take actions necessary and appropriate to promote the competitiveness of the United States” in the blockchain industry.  See also: Why the SEC Shouldn't Classify ETH as a Security | Opinion  This comes ahead of the Senate’s vote on the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), considered to be the most significant piece of crypto-specific legislation with the greatest likelihood of actually becoming law. As my colleague Nikhilesh De astutely points out:  “House Democratic leaders on the Financial Services and Agriculture Committees told their members that while they oppose the FIT21 bill, they wouldn't actively whip against it – in other words, they essentially told their members to vote how they see fit.”  This is similar to recent votes in the House and Senate to repeal the SEC's controversial Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, which imposed severe capital requirements on crypto custodians and all but foreclosed the possibility of banks moving into the space (and strongly opposed by both the crypto and TradFi communities).  The theory is, when President Joseph Biden vowed to veto the measure to repeal SAB121, he cleared a path for congress members – including prominent Democrats like Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden (D-OR) – to vote their conscience.  It remains to be seen whether Biden will veto the measure, despite the fact that the independent Government Accountability Office (GAO) said the SEC inappropriately imposed the guidance. However, the important thing here is that sane, bipartisan, crypto rulemaking is possible, despite the opposition of figures like arch crypto skeptic Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).  Speaking of which, Warren may be losing influence in the Biden Administration. Yesterday, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman Martin Gruenberg announced he would be stepping down after the Senate Banking Committee Chair, Sherod Brown, called for his resignation.  While the move does not directly pertain to crypto, it is worth mentioning that Gruenberg is a known confidant of Sen. Warren – and their view of crypto is largely cut from the same cloth. Under Gruenberg’s leadership, for instance, the FDIC took a hard line against crypto during the financial crisis in 2023 that brought down three medium-sized banks.  Although it largely cited poor risk-management and incompetent leadership, the FDIC also said Signature Bank’s “association with and reliance on crypto industry deposits” was a major cause for its failure in its report. That same year the agency officially added crypto to its annual report on risks facing U.S. banks and began entering into “robust supervisory discussions” with the firms under its charge.  Further, Castle Island Ventures co-founder Nic Carter considers Gruenberg to be one of the major “architects” of what he called Operation Choke Point 2.0, or a series of maneuvers by the U.S. government to systemically cripple the crypto industry (the name is a callback to the Obama era effort to de-bank unsavory industries). Indeed, following the collapse of FTX, the White House issued its first fact sheet related to crypto, essentially calling for a crackdown.  See also: The Reality Behind the Crypto Banking Crackdown | Opinion  To be sure, there are a few major caveats to consider here. First of all, Gruenberg resigned under political pressure following a Wall Street Journal report on widespread evidence of sexual harassment at the FDIC. The septuagenarian himself wasn’t accused of harassment, however he did allow a toxic workplace culture to fester – which is why Sen. Brown called for his ouster (which Sen. Warren called “politically motivated”).  All of this is to say that crypto is not a motivating factor here, although some political commentators are looking at the Gruenberg situation as a sign of the Warren faction’s waning influence. For instance, John Deaton, who is challenging Sen. Warren for her senatorial seat this November, said it was “shameful” how Warren “circled the wagons to keep one of her disgraced puppets in place.”  It’s also important to note that Congress is not the White House, and the White House is not the SEC. In other words, there is no real reason to assume that the Biden administration is suddenly telling either Gary Gensler or legislators to, like, take it easy on crypto. These are all discrete events, but they’re all positive developments for crypto.  Regarding the possibility of ETH ETF approval, the going idea is that the SEC was resistant because it wasn’t having productive meetings with prospective issuers. And “the fact that their meetings became more recently productive doesn't necessarily mean there was a policy reversal,” as CoinDesk policy expert Jesse Hamilton said.  But what if there really were a driving force behind all of these developments? What explains the widespread sea change? And why would a Dem-controlled government suddenly become pro-crypto now?  The 100 pound gorilla  “The backdrop to all of this is an election where the Republican party's standard-bearer, former President Donald Trump, has explicitly made an appeal to crypto voters as part of his strategy,” De said.  Indeed, the former president has seemingly intuited that the crypto contingent is something of a well-heeled political force, and has been currying favor. There are a few cynics who argue the billionaire real estate developer is primarily motivated by his bags (Trump has issued several NFT series, and holds a fair amount of ETH and other tokens), but that seems needlessly narrow a view.  The alignment makes perfect sense: Crypto gets peoples’ attention. And Trump likes to get attention. Crypto also gets a certain type of person angry, and it just so happens that these are the same people Trump likes to get angry. Crypto advocates also like powerful people willing to speak positively about crypto. And Trump likes his praise.  Passionate crypto advocates like Messari founder Ryan Selkis (a Consensus speaker, by the way) have been saying for years that the industry needs to organize into a coherent political block. In recent months, this has become more of a reality. Experts say crypto-focused political action committees (PACs) have more influence in Washington D.C. than ever, and are spending tens of millions of dollars across the country to influence elections up and down the ballot.  See also: Bitcoin Is Free and Fair but Not Progressive | Opinion  And while both parties could conceivably claim the “apolitical” crypto narrative for their own, there is something to the idea that the industry’s somewhat contradictory situation of being both rooted in Occupy Wall Street-era populism while also most frequently being associated with the “hilariously rich” is undeniably Trumpian. To some extent, I’m surprised it took so long for Trump to come around to it.  Which gets us to the main point: Why now? It is clear that Trump has come out in support of crypto because it is a wedge issue he can use against his rival, President Biden. While the general public is not likely clued into the nitty gritty politics of crypto regulation, a surprising amount of registered voters hold crypto and have a positive sentiment towards it. In particular, nearly 25% of self-identified independent voters (i.e. the key “swing voter”) have bought crypto. And that number will only increase over time, especially following the launch of crypto ETFs.  On the other side of the equation, because Trump has set himself up as an oppositional figure to the Biden administration’s slow boiling war against crypto (which has literally won over at least a handful of voters who despise his other policies), the easiest way for Biden to solve the issue is to either do a 180 on crypto himself or simply make it less of a problem.  This is compounded by the fact that, while the majority of Americans still do not interact with or care that much about crypto, there have been a series of missteps by regulators that have garnered something almost akin to sympathy for the industry. The biggest bloody nose being the SEC’s handling of approving bitcoin ETFs, which was called “arbitrary and capricious” by an appeals court.  But there is a growing sense that this same cavalier and biased view carries through all of the Biden administration’s crypto efforts. Americans want crypto to be safe and well regulated, they want consumer protections; they do not want arcane debates about whether an asset is a security.  Moreover, it is conceivable that a strong reaction to the industry’s cataclysmic failures in 2022 was politically advantageous but now that prices are climbing again a heavy handed approach seems both like a waste of government resources and potentially overreaching. This is to say nothing of the fact that provoking the crypto industry always garners backlash from insiders.  Again, all of this is mere speculation: there is no direct evidence that Biden is reversing course. It is significant that a major piece of crypto legislation has made it this far, that ETH ETFs being approved is back in play and that Trump has won over the “single issue” crypto voters. Consider this a vibes analysis, a theory that can never be proven but can grow stronger if more positive advancements like this happen.

Crypto analyst Rekt Capital earlier today highlighted on the X platform that a weekly candle close above approximately $71,500 could potentially initiate a breakout from the current “Re-Accumulation Range.” However, the analysts disclosed that history suggests that Bitcoin may need to consolidate within this range for several more weeks to align more closely with historical Halving Cycles, which have previously influenced its price trajectory. #BTC A Weekly Candle Close above ~$71500 would probably kickstart the breakout from the Re-Accumulation Range However, history suggests Bitcoin should consolidate inside this Re-Accumulation Range for several weeks more Extended consolidation here would get Bitcoin closer to… pic.twitter.com/Af0W4MMBTN — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) May 21, 2024 This extended consolidation period, as highlighted by the analyst, could benefit Bitcoin’s long-term growth. Particularly, it could help the cryptocurrency “resynchronize” with previous cycles, potentially leading to a longer and more sustained bull run, as opposed to a shorter, more accelerated cycle that peaks sooner. Rekt Capital noted: After all, the current acceleration in the cycle is still around 190 days (which is an improvement from the 260-day acceleration set in mid-March when BTC made new All Time Highs) The analyst pointed out that while both scenarios are bullish, the preference between a shorter or a typically longer bull run remains a matter of market speculation. Currently, the discussion revolves around whether Bitcoin can continue to defy historical trends with a break above the $71,500 range. Parabolic Rise Ahead For Bitcoin Meanwhile, another analyst, TechDev, recently provided insights into Bitcoin’s potential future trajectory, drawing parallels between the current market actions and those of the 2017 bull run. Back then, Bitcoin saw a significant rise, recording a 1,200% increase on its way to the previous high of $20,000. TechDev’s analysis suggests that Bitcoin could be setting up for another parabolic rise, potentially reaching as high as $100,000, especially given its longer consolidation period in the current market cycle compared to 2017. Supporting this viewpoint, RektCapital hinted that even a price of $72,000 would seem modest in the coming months if Bitcoin continues on its projected path. #BTC Even $72000 will be a low price for Bitcoin, months from now$BTC #Crypto #Bitcoin — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) May 20, 2024 Notably, the surge in Bitcoin’s price recorded so far is influenced by a mix of optimism and anticipation surrounding the potential approval of Ethereum spot ETFs and increasing inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Quiet Down – Here’s Why And What It Means For The Market Data from Farside indicates that spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced their most substantial inflow week in two months, with the US fund category collectively achieving $948 million in positive net flows from May 13 to May 17.

42418168,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTckNp,1716312600,Uniswap Labs Urges SEC to Drop Pending Enforcement Action in Wells Response,"Uniswap Labs moved Tuesday to quash a looming regulatory battle over Ethereum's dominant decentralized crypto exchange, imploring the Securities and Exchange Commission in legal filings that its planned lawsuit wasn't worth the fight.  The company received a Wells notice – essentially a heads-up from the SEC notifying the recipient that the regulator believes it broke the law – in April. The notice accused the Uniswap protocol of being an unregistered securities exchange and the interface and wallet as being unregistered securities brokers.  In their response to the SEC’s Wells notice, Uniswap Labs pushed back against this assertion, arguing that the protocol does not meet the definition of an exchange and is thus not subject to regulation by the SEC. Though Uniswap Labs said it invented the protocol, it said the protocol is now a “passive” technology that people use to trade cryptocurrencies.  Uniswap Labs’ Chief Legal Officer Marvin Ammori told reporters on Tuesday that the SEC would have to redefine what an exchange is in order to have jurisdiction over Uniswap. Under the current definition, Ammori said, Uniswap would have had to be specifically designed for securities trading.  “It is general purpose, and the majority of its volume are obvious non-securities like Ethereum, Bitcoin and stablecoins,” Ammori said, adding that bitcoin, ether and stablecoins account for 65% of the protocol’s trading volume.  Read more: DeFi Exchange Uniswap Receives Enforcement Notice From the SEC  Ammori said that the SEC knows that the current definition of an exchange does not cover any of Uniswap Labs products.  “That’s why, as we speak, there’s a pending rulemaking where the SEC is trying to redefine about half a dozen words in their own regulations to try to capture us. That’s not going to work,” Ammori said. “It goes beyond their authority given by Congress.”  Ammori also said that the SEC’s accusation that Uniswap’s interface and wallet are brokers will fail as well, pointing to a recent ruling from a federal judge dismissing the SEC’s claims that the Coinbase Wallet constituted an unregistered securities broker.  Because the SEC would have to stretch its authority to regulate Uniswap, the protocol’s lawyers argued, the agency “should not take on these significant litigation risks.” The lawyers added that bringing a case against Uniswap would push American crypto investors to use foreign trading protocols and would discourage “future innovators from attempting to foster new ideas that bring much-needed competition and innovation to financial and commercial markets.”  “We will litigate if we have to, and if we litigate we will win,” Ammori said. “But we are hoping that the SEC sees that their current strategy is not protecting anyone and not benefiting Americans.”  What's in the Uniswap Wells Notice  Tuesday's filing shed additional light on the arguments the SEC appears poised to make in its yet-to-be-filed enforcement action against Uniswap Labs. The regulatory agency is targeting Uniswap's native UNI token as well as liquidity provider (LP) tokens.  LP tokens are core to how so-called ""automated market makers"" such as Uniswap work. Users who deposit their assets into the protocol's trading pools get LP tokens as a receipt on their contribution. They can swap their LP tokens for the value of their deposits. Meanwhile, the protocol uses those deposits to make sure other traders can make the trades they wish.  According to Uniswap Labs' Wells response, the SEC alleges LP tokens are investment contracts whose distribution violates securities law. Uniswap Labs rejects that argument on the grounds that LP tokens don't fit into the regulator's frameworks, and are rather ""bookkeeping devices.""  Last December the SEC hinted at increased scrutiny of LP tokens in its settlement with BarnBridge DAO, according to the law firm K&L Gates. If it moves forward with the allegations Uniswap Labs outlined Tuesday, the regulator's enforcement action could outline a coming fight with broad implications for how DeFi ticks.",NEUTRAL,UNI,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | UNI,"Cheyenne Ligon, Danny Nelson",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/05/21/uniswap-labs-urges-sec-to-drop-pending-enforcement-action-in-wells-response,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/97517f49568d980b7a61b6455598c2fdcec14aed-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42418182,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTckW5,1716311141,Second Ethereum Foundation Researcher Acknowledges Advisory Deal Paid in EIGEN,"Dankrad Feist, namesake of the Ethereum data-storage method of ""danksharding,"" disclosed in a post on X that he has taken on an advisory role at EigenFoundation, which supports the pioneering restaking protocol EigenLayer.  Feist promised that the allocation of EIGEN token he has received will not influence his positions on how EigenLayer should be developed.  Disclosure follows a similar posting earlier in the week by another prominent Ethereum Foundation researcher, Justin Drake.  The advisory arrangements have raised questions about possible conflicts of interest, especially with many blockchain experts flagging potential systemic threats to Ethereum posed by the emergence of EigenLayer.  A top Ethereum Foundation (EF) developer, Dankrad Feist, disclosed Tuesday that he has accepted a paid role at EigenFoundation, a newly created non-profit meant to guide EigenLayer, the pioneering ""restaking"" protocol that many skeptics have flagged as potentially posing systemic risks to the world's largest smart-contracts blockchain.  Feist disclosed in a post on X that the position comes with a significant allocation of EigenLayer’s new EIGEN token, though did not specify how many tokens he would be receiving.  The announcement comes a few days after another top EF developer, Justin Drake, also disclosed that he would be advising the EigenFoundation, with ""a significant token incentive which could easily be worth more than the combined value of all my other assets (mostly ETH),"" with a value of ""millions of dollars of tokens vesting over 3 years.""  The news set off a debate on crypto twitter about whether advising the EigenFoundation would constitute a conflict of interest, especially given how prominent Drake and Feist are at the Ethereum Foundation – and how serious many blockchain experts are taking the potential systemic threats posed by the emergence of EigenLayer.  The disclosures came after the crypto influencer Cobie used the social-media platform X, where he has 724,000 followers, to publicly ask Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin how he felt about ""core developers or researchers taking life–changing $ packages from projects built on Ethereum to become 'advisors,' when those projects may have conflicted incentives with Ethereum, either now or in the future?""  That post came in response to a post by Buterin in which he wrote that he was ""really proud that Ethereum does not have any culture of trying to prevent people from speaking their minds.""  Some posters on X applauded the Cobie call-out.  “Props to @cobie for insisting on ethical disclosures and holding people to account despite the onslaught of toxic bagerholderism he gets in response...very few willing to do it,” said @lex_node on X.  Feist is a well known contributor to the Ethereum discourse and technology, so prominent that the technology of ""danksharding"" – a way of storing data at cheaper fees than from using regular transactions – is named after him.  ""I am taking this position personally, not representing the Ethereum Foundation, and with a focus on risks and decentralization. I am therefore fully expected to take contrarian views on Eigenlayer,"" Feist wrote in his post. ""I do receive a significant amount of tokens from this position. I do not believe that they will change or influence my positions on how the core protocol should be developed, but I believe that the community should know about this, so that they can keep me accountable.""  Feist acknowledged that many skeptics fear ""Eigenlayer will lead to a dystopia of dangerously designed restaking services,"" and that a ""second type of risk comes from the additional load imposed on stakers by running restaking services,"" which ""can lead to centralizing forces.""  ""I think Eigenlayer will be a major benefit to Ethereum, if it is done by someone with high integrity,"" Feist wrote. ""I trust the current leaders are intending to do that, and I am planning to hold them accountable for it.""  Drake noted in his disclosure that he pledged ""to reinject all advisorship proceeds towards worthy projects within the Ethereum ecosystem, either as investments or donations,"" and that he also stands ready ""to end the advisorship at any time, e.g. should EigenLayer go in a direction I deem to be against Ethereum's interests.""  He also said that, given his ""focus on restaking risks,"" one can expect his ""default public stance to continue to lean critical of EigenLayer.""  ""I will try to make my criticism constructive, advocating for mitigations to risks like the erosion of solo validators and the intersubjective overloading of Ethereum consensus,” Drake wrote.  Another user on X, @themandalore9, wrote: “I applaud the transparency, but he was probably the biggest / most well known voice in the fight against LST's and restaking. I know he say's he'll stay critical, but money corrupts the subconscious in ways that you'd never believe.”  Read more: EigenLayer Opens Claims for Airdrop of EIGEN Token, Though It's Non-Transferable",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | AIRDROP,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/05/21/second-ethereum-foundation-researcher-acknowledges-advisory-deal-paid-in-eigen,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/31ed5e927acd2074403e75ffbc813963af016ef8-1920x1081.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

CEO Eric Schiermeyer said ""will probably buy and burn.""  Gala investor DWF Labs also said that it had purchased 28 million GALA tokens.  Gala Games has received nearly $23 million worth of ETH tokens from the hacker who on Monday minted and then sold hundreds of millions worth of its native {{GALA}} token, according to on-chain records and statements in Gala's Discord server.  The change of fortunes leaves Gala with an unexpected $23 million windfall in ETH tokens. ""We will probably buy and burn on galaswap,"" said the project's CEO Eric Schiermeyer, also known as Benefactor, in its Discord server. That means using the ETH to buy GALA tokens and then taking those tokens out of circulation.  Gala Games is a blockchain gaming platform with a variety of video games where players hold NFTs and other crypto assets. The GALA token is the platform's currency for buying and selling in-game assets.  The move comes one day after an unidentified hacker exploited Gala's internal controls to mint 5 billion new GALA tokens. The individual then sold 600 million of those tokens on decentralized exchanges and netted nearly 6,000 ETH tokens. On Tuesday the wallet associated with the hack transferred all of its ETH to a wallet controlled by Gala Games.  ""We believe we have identified the culprit and we are currently working with the FBI, DOJ and a network of international authorities,"" Schiermeyer said Monday.  The exploit caused GALA's price to drop as much as 19% on Monday as traders fretted over the implications of the increased circulating supply and the hackers' selling pressure.  Earlier Tuesday, Gala investor DWF Labs said it had purchased 28 million GALA tokens ""to alleviate market selling pressures.""

The views and opinions expressed are those of the author and not associated with CoinDesk. This is not financial advice.  Can you describe your accelerator program, Codebase, and its purpose?  Codebase plays a strategic role in Avalanche’s overarching vision of becoming the premier blockchain platform for startups aiming to launch scalable companies. We provide intensive, hands-on support to the most promising startups in Web3 as they launch and/or move their projects onto our chain. In some ways analogous to your standard accelerator model — weekly workshops, mentor support — we differ in that we do not take equity in participating companies at the beginning of the cohort. Instead, each team receives a $50k grant with three investments from a $400k prize pool to be awarded at Codebase’s Demo Day, which is judged by five industry heavyweights. Ultimately, the purpose of Codebase is to help accelerate the growth of the Avalanche ecosystem. We believe that one of the most effective ways to do this is to find high-potential teams in the space and shower them with resources, which is exactly what we’re doing with Codebase.  Why do you think projects are being built on Avalanche?  We’d like to think we’ve built a better mousetrap, and maybe we have, but objectively speaking, we've developed an advanced platform setting us apart in the blockchain space, featuring a unique consensus mechanism, subnetworks, and integrated blockchains. Our mission is to digitize global assets on the Avalanche blockchain. Our user-friendly, cost-effective platform stands out for its reliability and decentralization. The caliber of companies adopting our blockchain, like Deloitte for disaster relief, Amazon for enterprise, and Lemonade for insurance, speaks volumes about our platform's quality.  What else about Avalanche may set it apart from other blockchains?  I’dpoint to our subnets as a prime example. Our subnets are a standout feature, offering custom, application-specific blockchains within the Avalanche ecosystem. They allow developers full control over user experience, from fee tokens to network validation and virtual machine operations. Subnets not only benefit from Avalanche's security and speed but also isolate application activity, preventing high traffic from causing network-wide congestion. This efficiency minimizes transaction fees for all users.  What are some key features and functionalities of Avalanche that may attract institutions?  Three key functionalities set us apart in the blockchain space. First, HyperSDK empowers developers to build high-performance Virtual Machines on Avalanche, enabling them to create some of the fastest blockchains globally. Second, Vryx is our initiative to boost Avalanche's transaction speed to approximately 100,000 transactions per second, integrated into the HyperSDK testnet. Lastly, Firewood is our advanced, Rust-based database designed to store blockchain state. Unlike traditional databases, Firewood uses a trie structure as an on-disk index, eliminating the need for compaction and pruning, ensuring efficient state management.

28221648,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=609130,1716307224,Why Is The Ethereum Price Up 20% Today?,"The Ethereum price has risen almost 20% in the last 24 hours. This is a positive development for the second-largest crypto token, which has been lagging until now. Ethereum’s price surge is believed to be due to several factors, including the potential approval of the Spot Ethereum ETFs. SEC Could Soon Approve Spot Ethereum ETFs Ethereum has risen on the news that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could approve the Spot Ethereum ETF applications. Before now, it was almost certain that the Commission would deny these applications. However, the SEC is now open to approving these funds based on Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas’s revelation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Investors Are Dumping Amid Jump To $67,000, Why This Is Good For Price Balchunas revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that he and fellow Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart were increasing their odds of Spot Ethereum ETF approval to 75% (from 25%), having heard that the SEC could likely approve these funds due to “increasingly political issue.” Seyffart also confirmed this development, stating that “things are taking a turn for the better on Spot #ethereum ETF approvals this week. Upping our odds to 75%.” Seyffart further noted in a subsequent X post that the 75% approval odds relate to the 19b-4 filings, with VanEck’s final deadline coming up on May 23. The SEC will still need to approve the S-1 filings before these funds can launch. S-1 approvals could take up to months, meaning that it could take a while before these Spot Ethereum ETFs go live. However, that hasn’t stopped Ethereum whales from believing, and this group of investors is another reason why ETH’s price has shot up recently. Data from the market intelligence platform shows that these whales bought over 110,000 ETH ($341 million) between May 19 and 20. This has turned out to be profitable since Ethereum’s price had been priced in on the rumors of a rejection. Time For Ethereum Price And Altcoins To Make Their Move With the recent development that the SEC will likely approve the Spot Ethereum ETFs, Ethereum and other altcoins look primed to make significant moves to the upside. Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe had predicted that the news around the Spot Ethereum ETFs would trigger a rally for Ethereum and altcoins. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Mirrors Historical Pattern That Led To $1,200 Surge, Will History Repeat Itself? While explaining why he swapped his Bitcoin holdings for Altcoins, Van de Poppe suggested that Ethereum (and other altcoins) would likely see a bullish reversal once the news about a denial of the Spot Ethereum ETFs was out since the crypto token was already priced into this news. He added that things could even be better if the news turns out to be better than people expect, which is currently the case with the SEC looking increasingly likely to approve these funds. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Javon Marks predicted that an Ethereum breakout will kickstart the altcoin season. That already looks to be the case, seeing how other altcoins have enjoyed significant price gains in the last 24 hours thanks to the second largest crypto token by market cap.

Aevo saw a surge in trading activity leading up to its token launch in March, but volumes have faltered since then.  The native token of decentralized crypto derivatives trading platform Aevo climbed Tuesday after Binance Labs, the investment and research arm of crypto exchange giant Binance, revealed in a blog post that it invested in the protocol.  AEVO climbed 10% to $0.9, the highest price since mid-May. Even so, it's still nearly 70% below where it started trading in March at around $3, CoinGecko data shows.  Binance Labs didn't disclose the size of the investment, nor how it acquired the stake and whether bought tokens.  Aevo is a rebrand of Ribbon Finance and is built on top of its own Ethereum layer-2 (L2) network using the OP tech stack. It allows users to trade crypto perpetual futures, options and tokens before their launch using an off-chain order book, settling trades on the Ethereum blockchain.  The platform enjoyed a flurry of trading activity in February and early March, surpassing $1 billion in daily derivatives trading volume, largely as a result of farming incentives ahead of the token launch. Traffic since then faltered, recording well below $100 million daily recently, DefiLlama data show.

42418188,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTckbF,1716303755,Crypto Sleuth Ogle Proposes Security-Centric 'Glue' Blockchain,"Pseudonymous crypto sleuth Ogle has witnessed plenty of failures while investigating DeFi hacks. He's part of a cottage industry of security experts who clean up the mess from attackers targeting crypto-finance projects almost daily. His specialty: tracking them down and getting the projects' money back.  Stopping these heists depends on good smart contract code and savvy security. In an interview with CoinDesk, Ogle said it's also a game of incentives. If an attacker believes the personal cost of their exploit may be too high, they might decide against mounting it at all.  That ethos is one of the pillars behind Ogle's upcoming blockchain, called Glue. It plans to fund a security blanket that raises the stakes for black hats and – hopefully – prompts them to take their heisting elsewhere.  Glue has largely flown under the radar this year despite raising at a $1.4 billion valuation in a public token sale. It's another newcomer layer 1 blockchain at a time when oodles of competitors are vying for the attention of crypto traders and developers.  Ogle's entrant doesn't have the name-brand appeal of buzzy platforms like Monad and Berachain, two other yet-to-launch blockchain platforms. Instead, it deployed guerilla marketing tactics (like handing out Spy-style manilla envelopes at industry conferences) to stoke intrigue.  In interviews with CoinDesk Ogle and co-founder SnapShot outlined Glue's philosophy, security and design. They believe it can appeal to ""regular people who don't do crypto all day long"" as well as traditional financial professionals ""who can't come onto a platform where they think they're going to be rugged.""  Hub security  ""We want to build something that actually has a chance of competing with the banks,"" said Glue co-founder Snapshot.  Glue will be built around an activity ""hub"" that aggregates DeFi services for chain users. That level of curation makes Glue markedly different from the construction of most other blockchains. Usually, their users must find what they're looking for themselves.  ""'Centralization' is a dirty word in crypto for a good reason but from a UX perspective I think we can have a much more central interface,"" SnapShot said. Ogle said Glue Hub will make on-chain onboarding smooth – ""almost like Coinbase.""  The approach targets the 90% of crypto users who SnapShot said stick to centralized exchanges, rather than the ""one million – basically no one"" that he said operate on-chain.  Glue Hub won't be the only place where users can trade. The chain is permissionless, meaning anyone can build and launch anything for anyone to use. These creations could be integrated with Glue Hub if they pass security checks like audits commissioned by Glue.  Audits have emerged in crypto as a kind of marketing tool in their own right. Projects commission reports from chain-checking specialists who scour their smart contracts to squash money-losing bugs. These checks aren't definitive – plenty of audited projects still get exploited – but projects tout their clean bills of health as stamps of approval.  That practice has gone too far, according to Ogle, who said he used to run an auditing firm. Many projects are only willing to be transparent about good-looking reports, and opt to bury the bad, he said.  ""That's not good for security, for the cryptosphere itself,"" he said.  In place of this Ogle said high-caliber projects on Glue could be subjected to audits funded by the chain via the Glue Security Fund. This fund will get its money from a tiny tax applied to every transaction, the founders said. It will pay for various efforts to promote security across the entire chain.  Audits don't always work. Lending protocol Euler lost $200 million to a hack that slipped past 10 audits in two years. Ogle participated in Euler's recovery as part of the war room that tracked down the hacker and negotiated the return of that money. Ogle claims he has a 65% success rate in getting money back for the 40-odd exploited projects he's assisted.  ""We have actual funds set aside for me and a group of people to go and chase down anyone who does bad things on"" Glue, Ogle said. He later added that any security service (be they vigilante detectives, auditors or analytics compliance tools) will be able to apply for grants from the GSF. Holders of Glue's token will determine what's funded, he said.  The idea with GSF is to disincentivize hackers from trying to attack Glue projects in the first place. They won't be able to catch everybody, Ogle said. But if would-be hackers are comparison-shopping targets, they might think twice about hitting the mark that has a war chest ready to pay for chasing them down.  Transactions on Glue will be multi-sig, meaning any attempt to move money from wallets will require multiple approvals from the user. Ogle said this default setup opens the door for third-party services to build tools that increase user security by, say, flagging any money movement that looks out of the ordinary.  This could save people from losing money to otherwise innocent-looking wallet interactions.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/05/21/crypto-sleuth-ogle-proposes-security-centric-glue-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b25fecc18e3f1c1c86f8705a1c2eb68fcecf8f38-5184x2916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ethereum Net Taker Volume On Binance Has Just Seen Its Biggest Candle Ever As explained by CryptoQuant community manager Maartunn in a post on X, the Ethereum Net Taker Volume has observed a sharp increase after rumors have surfaced that the ETH spot ETFs have a renewed chance of gaining approval. The “Net Taker Volume” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the difference between the ETH taker buy and taker sell volumes on any given centralized exchange. Related Reading: Litecoin Whales Go On $230 Million Buying Spree: Will This Change LTC’s Stars? When the value of this metric is positive, it means that the taker buy or long volume is outpacing the taker sell or short volume on the platform right now. Such a trend implies a bullish sentiment is dominant among the investors. On the other hand, the indicator being negative suggests the presence of a majority bearish mentality among the users of the exchange as the shorts are outpacing the longs. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Ethereum Net Taker Volume on the cryptocurrency exchange Binance over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum Net Taker Volume on Binance has just registered a huge positive spike, the implying investors have just opened a large amount of longs on the platform. More specifically, the indicator’s value during this spike has been $530 million, which, according to the analyst, is the single largest spike the cryptocurrency has ever seen. “Binance-traders are longing the Ethereum ETF-news like there is no tomorrow,” notes Maartunn. This isn’t particularly surprising, considering the market is very well aware what a spot ETF could mean for the asset after having witnessed what went down for Bitcoin. The ETF news pre-approval had been bullish for BTC and while the approval itself had initially led to bearish price action, it eventually paid off for the asset as capital started rapidly flowing in through these investment vehicles and the coin enjoyed a rally that led to a new all-time high (ATH). In another X post, the CryptoQuant analyst pointed out that the Ethereum Open Interest has shot up as well. The “Open Interest” measures the total amount of ETH-related positions that are currently open on all derivative exchanges. This trend isn’t that unexpected, given that derivatives users have been opening a large amount of longs for the asset. With this rapid surge, the Ethereum Open Interest has managed to set a new ATH. Related Reading: Bitcoin “Profit-Taking Has Completed,” Top Analyst Reveals Historically, intense speculation has generally led to more volatility for the coin, as the risk of large liquidations happening can become high in such periods. As such, this Open Interest spike may signal some turbulent times ahead for Ethereum.

42418184,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTckX7,1716301255,Filip Wielanier: 'Web3 Marketing Is a Win-Win',"Every marketer needs data. The problem is that in Web3, getting that data is tricky. Where are your customers coming from, what are they doing? This is basic stuff in Web2. It’s Marketing 101. But in Web3, you have off-chain behavior and on-chain behavior, and it’s hard to connect the two.  Enter Cookie3, which describes itself as “the first open MarketingFi economy shared between users, creators, and businesses.” Cookie3 is many things, including: A Web3 marketing ecosystem intended to connect creators to advertisers, a tool for KOL (key online influencers) to quantify their reputation, and, most of all, an AI-powered data analytics tool that lets projects understand both off-chain and on-chain marketing behavior.  This interview is part of CoinDesk's Web3 Marketing Week.  “You can think of it as an Google Analytics alternative,” says Filip Wielanier, Cookie3’s co-founder and CEO, who has a background in both IT and digital marketing at Deloitte. Using the Cookie3 plug-in, Web3 projects can understand customers’ ROI, lifetime value, and contribution to on-chain progress. Wielanier explains how Cookie3 analytics work, why this data is crucial for any project, and why Web3 marketing is a “win-win situation for everyone, because the creators are building much more engaged communities.”  Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  What are some of the biggest advantages in Web3 marketing over Web2 marketing?  Filip Wielanier: In Web3, you have the ability to directly communicate and incentivize your contributors. And you can decentralize what’s called “publishers” in Web2. You can make them your own ambassadors. You can also collaborate with other creators who contribute directly to your ecosystem, and also to provide them value directly, which is very hard to do in Web2 marketing. And this is exactly why we created Cookie3 Affiliate -- to provide it in an automated and permission-less way. You can think of Cookie3 Affiliate as a kind of matchmaking between the creators and advertisers.  You mentioned the Cookie3 Affiliate program, but what’s the overall vision of Cookie3?  The current vision is to provide the fair value distribution between different stakeholders including retail individuals, creators, and companies. We’re creating the whole ecosystem to provide that for everyone. Right now in crypto, specifically, some groups of insiders have a huge advantage in terms of information, and we want to open this up to the whole market.  I love this in theory, but can you give an example to make it more concrete?  Sure. So basically, we’re the data company. We use an AI data layer, specifically, and we’re working on different solutions including a user analytics platform -- Cookie3 analytics. You can kind of think of this as a Google Analytics alternative. We help people understand flows such as user attribution, transactions, and conversions on-chain. The two worlds of off-chain and on-chain data are pretty hard to be measured together, and we’re providing that information in one place.  Got it. So who are your main end-users, generally? Projects or companies looking to better understand their customers?  Yeah. So we are B2B2C. [Business to business to consumer.] So any DeFi platform, DEX, or gamify platform -- you name it -- that wants to onboard users needs to optimize their spending on marketing. And they’d like to tailor their communications to specific groups of users. Thanks to our insights, they can finally understand who’s actually using their platform, what are the flows, what are the attribution sources. You can see the ROI of marketing campaigns. And in the Web3 world, we have a challenging environment because there’s off-chain attribution and then on-chain conversions, and it’s hard to measure that together.  Can you give a concrete example of how this kind of insight can help a project?  We’ve got this amazing use case of our client Notum. They managed to decrease their marketing cost by 64%. They thought they were doing well because they had a lot of people come in, but once they looked at the on-chain data, they saw that the people they were attributing had very low amount of tokens and liquidity in their wallets, and obviously that's not who you want logging into your platform. These users were not generating value or revenue.  So they looked at other channels that might bring in a lower quantity of people, but people who are more valuable users. They completely stopped putting money into users who weren’t bringing value. Vanity metrics only get you so far.  Vanity metrics?  A vanity metric is, for example, when you’re doing an airdrop and you have a lot of bots follow your Twitter and your numbers look amazing. It’s a vanity project.  I’m glad you mentioned bots. How do you handle the problem of bots when you’re analyzing data? And I’m guessing this is now even more complicated in the world of AI?  Yeah, so I won’t tell you the exact details of that, because once I tell you that…  It’s your secret sauce!  [Both laugh.]  But you know, it’s this constant chase. They [bad actors] are chasing up. We’re chasing them, basically. And there are plenty of [actors] who are just abusing certain metrics and behaviors to get some airdrops, for example, and to drain valuable from an airdrop campaign. These are real risks, because we are sometimes talking about multiple millions worth of tokens. In terms of how we’re approaching that, it’s very custom.  What are these bad actors doing exactly?  The attackers are creating multiple accounts that are focused on attacking specific protocols, or interacting with specific smart contracts to get some incentives or airdrops in the upcoming airdrop campaign. This is the most common use case in Sybil bots and Sybil attacks. They can create multiple, sometimes thousands or even tens of thousands of wallets.  You’re almost having to act as a cyber-security firm, on top of data analytics?  Kind of. And especially with the adoption of different AI solutions, it’s getting even harder because these Sybils are much more advanced and much more sophisticated than they were even a year ago. So it’s this constant race of chasing each other, because we’re using machine learning models to detect them. And they are using other models to not get detected.  And by the time our call is over, it will have evolved once again.  Yeah. So this is the actual environment and status quo that we’re living in. This is why projects like Worldcoin are great examples that Proof of Humanity is very needed in the future, because AIs are getting more sophisticated in their behaviors.  One of the taglines on your web page is “MarketingFi Protocol & AI Data Layer.” What does “AI data layer” mean exactly?  This is the thing we’re specializing in. We’re a data company and we’re providing those data points from different angles including on-chain. It’s kind of like Google Analytics data. And once a platform integrates into our analytics plugin, they have all the data play with and understand the behavior of their users.  Can you give another example of an insight that a company could glean from using all this?  Yeah, sure. So basically, any Mention or Like [on social media] can be measured. If anyone is digitally talking about or promoting your product, you can see the outcome of that. This could apply to marketing activities like advertisements, or collaborations with influencers, or quest platforms. Thanks to us, basically, you can see the real out come -- not just in terms of the number of visits or the time that folks spend on your website coming from a specific source and spending an exact amount of money, but you can actually see the real outcome to your protocol. Thanks to on-chain stats, you can check and see how much liquidity came from different sources. You can finally calculate the ROI and customer acquisition cost and customer lifetime value. These are pretty fundamental metrics in the Web2 marketing world, but not so common in Web3 because they are just hard to measure.  Let’s finish with the Web3 vision of how decentralized creators can connect with consumers, instead of using Google or Facebook. Can you give an example of how this works?  Sure. So basically, there’s the advertiser that defines the campaign. Defines the conversion event, defines the reward for the conversion event. Then there’s a publisher -- in this case the creator -- that decides whether he or she would like to participate. And then he's promoting the product to get some conversions, and per each conversion -- which is being verified by our verification engine -- a smart contract is paying out rewards to the creator. And those rewards can be also cost-shared with the end user. This is just one concrete example, but there are many others.  And on top of that, thanks to the blockchain, you can even reward your communities if they are engaging you. It's a win-win situation for everyone, because the creators are building much more engaged communities, thanks to this value-sharing approach.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MINING | WLD | AIRDROP,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/05/21/filip-wielanier-web3-marketing-is-a-win-win,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a4ca8fbc13723db80a96a65123b61ec5f938334f-4800x2700.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

28216866,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=609147,1716300029,"Shiba Inu Breaks Out Of Bull Flag Pattern-Like, Signaling Uptrend","In a noteworthy development for Shiba Inu investors and traders, well-known cryptocurrency analyst and enthusiast Javon Marks has verified SHIB’s break out from the Bull Flag pattern, an indicator that typically signals the start of an upward price movement. Shiba Inu Breakout To Trigger A Continuation 210% Price Increase Mark’s emphasis delves into the current bullish momentum surrounding Shiba Inu, which has caused traders and investors in the meme coin market to feel optimistic once again, indicating that the crypto asset could be positioned for more gains. Related Reading: If This Happens, Shiba Inu Price Could Double Soon According to the expert, SHIB has now exited a smaller Bull Flag-like pattern, and it is currently holding above it. This breakout appears to be significant as Javon Marks noted that it could start another major wave in an already enormous run on the upside. Specifically, this lesser break can trigger a continuation in an over 210% (3X) run to $0.000081 from the $0.0000254 level, provided that the larger breakout also holds. In addition, should Shiba Inu surpass the $0.000081 level, it might be poised for an additional 90% increase to the $0.0001553 mark. The post read: With a larger breakout also holding, this smaller break can initiate a continuation in an over 210% run to the $0.000081 target which is more than 3X from here. A break above $0.000081 and SHIB may just be set for another +90% move to $0.0001553. The analyst further drew attention to his previous forecasts, in which he predicted a run to the $0.000081 price level. He previously noted that Shiba Inu has made a strong comeback and appears to be primed for yet another huge surge towards the $0.000081 target. Thus, given the progressive breakout from the resisting trend, another 141% upside move to hit the aforementioned price target may not be far off. Also, following price declines, SHIB will garner strength to reach the level and move even higher to $0.0001553. Pullbacks To Buttress The Move Javon Mark affirms that since SHIB’s break out from the resisting trend, it has increased by over 129%, suggesting that a run is well within reach. At this point, Marks claims that as long as current prices maintain their breakout, pullbacks might only enhance these prices. Additionally, an extra 252% price increase toward $0.000081 will be aided by these pullbacks. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Makes Decisive Move: Is Now The Ideal Time To Buy? It is important to note that the analyst’s prediction began when SHIB ended a 441-day downtrend in September last year. Given the significance of the development, Marks believed SHIB was about to surge, putting his target at $0.000081, a 975% rise from $0.0000074. As of the time of writing, Shiba Inu was trading at $0.0000257, demonstrating over 6% growth in the past day. Both its market cap and trading volume have also attracted significant gains of about 6.83% and 147%, respectively.

42418172,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTckPt,1716299154,How Bitcoin ETFs Are Changing the Risk-Reward Ratio for Institutional Investors,"As anticipated, the rollout of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. market has made a massive positive impact on the digital asset industry. It’s unleashed a stampede of retail investors, and set records for investment into bitcoin {{BTC}} and into ETFs.  More importantly, being in a product approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has changed the risk reward ratio for bitcoin, bringing crypto back into the institutional investment conversation. That’s driving new interest from some firms and emboldening others to restart projects that had been put on pause. The door into the mainstream financial system has been reopened.  Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.  3 dimensions of risk  Institutional investors think about risk in many dimensions, with some being: products, counterparties and the risks around the underlying asset itself. In traditional finance (TradFi), all of these are well understood.  The products have become commoditized, with many firms offering similar products. The counterparties – the market makers, custodians, clearinghouses, etc. that help absorb trading risk are well known. The different asset classes are also well understood and there are time honored ways of evaluating the risks of a particular asset.  Over many years a lot of the risk and volatility has been taken out of the system. It’s black swan type events that create problems. The risk is low but so are the rewards. Opportunities to beat the market are hard to find.  What we’ve seen in crypto is a series of events that have had a negative impact, but are foreseeable given the industry’s lack of regulation and controls. The risk of these events happening has been too high for institutions to go after the outsized rewards.  Reducing the risks  The bitcoin ETFs reduce risk across all three dimensions.  ETFs have been available in the U.S. market for over 30 years. Everyone understands the product. Buying the asset in a securitized product is more straightforward than buying spot bitcoin outright. Many investors feel it’s a better path to pay a management fee to have someone else handle custody, settlement risk, and other operational aspects of trading Bitcoin. They no longer have to take those risks directly.  The presence of big brand names like BlackRock, Fidelity and others reduces counterparty risk. There are plenty of crypto native custodians, liquidity providers and market makers, but they are relatively unknown in the world of TradFi.  See also: Bitcoin ETFs Also Owned by Steven Cohen's Point72  The ETFs introduce some of the reliant counterparties within the crypto universe to general investors. Knowing that big TradFi players have done the due diligence on their financials, processes and procedures and security practices reduces the fear factor. Not only that, it shows them who they could go to for help if they wanted to hold bitcoin and other digital assets and do spot trading themselves in the future.  By approving bitcoin as an underlying product within the ETF space, the SEC has reduced risk at the base level of the asset – namely, the fear that crypto could be entirely banned in the U.S., obviously greater regulatory clarity could reduce asset risk further, but market demand for ETFs has pushed the agency to settle some important questions. It has also pushed ETF issuers to put in place many of the plain vanilla elements that reduce risk that institutional players expect to see.  All of these elements create trust in the market, which is crucial for resuming digital assets’ journey into the mainstream. There’s a lot of ideology, jargon and technical terms surrounding crypto. But essentially it's just another asset class that uses a different technology.  Prior to FTX, a lot of people put those risks aside and focus on price appreciation and gaining access to the market. Post FTX, people are saying, I want to be involved, but I need to know I'm protected at a basic level. The ETFs do that, while exposing institutional investors to the reliant counterparties in crypto. They’ve put the industry back on a positive track.  See also: Bitcoin ETF Holdings Disclosed by Morgan Stanley  There are two things keeping institutions away from digital assets right now. One is philosophical. They don’t believe in or like Bitcoin or crypto. Then there is a second camp for whom the risk/reward ratio still isn’t attractive enough. For these people, the success of the ETFs is making it increasingly difficult to sit on the sidelines, especially when clients are asking for crypto products.  The day will come where the main risk with Bitcoin and other digital assets is at the base level of asset performance – just as it is in TradFi. It isn’t going to be one ruling or one product that magically makes it happen.It’s going to be a long process, but eventually all the questions about products and counterparties and regulations will fade away.  The only question will be, do you want to invest in digital assets, or not?",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Steve Scott,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/05/21/how-bitcoin-etfs-are-changing-the-risk-reward-ratio-for-institutional-investors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a1d4de23b4b4b604286f589f822cafe062b7570f-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42418189,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTckcH,1716296400,Web3 Marketing Startup Spindl Launches On-Chain Ad Network,"Spindl, a Web3 startup founded by Silicon Valley veteran Antonio Garcia Martinez, has launched what it bills as the first truly on-chain ad network.  Like Web2's off-chain ad networks, this one connects advertisers, publishers, and providers of so-called attribution services that track where customers come from. In this case, the ""publishers"" are providers of crypto wallets that increasingly resemble social apps, with news feeds and ""discover"" tabs.  This story is part of CoinDesk's Web3 Marketing Week.  To be clear, the serving of ad content would occur off-chain as usual. But the advertisers would transfer funds for a campaign to a smart contract, which would release the money to the publisher only once the attribution provider verifies, by reviewing on-chain data, that an ad led to a sale. Conducting ad business this way brings advantages to all parties, according to participants.  ""It's more transparent. It's fair. It's natively on-chain. It's, to be blunt, better for privacy,"" said Garcia Martinez, CEO of Spindl, whose core service is attribution. ""We're not using weird, sketchy Web2 data,"" such as consumers' browsing history or their personal information, to target campaigns – just on-chain transactions, which are already public.  ""We're not doxxing anybody,"" he said.  This article is part of CoinDesk's Web3 Marketing Week series, presented by Cookie3.  What's in it for advertisers  Unlike the ""cost per mille"" model of web advertising, in which advertisers pay a price based on the number of times consumers see ads regardless of whether they buy anything, this network's advertisers will pay only for on-chain conversions, Garcia Martinez said. Such events could include a user minting an NFT or swapping tokens through a decentralized exchange or depositing crypto into a DeFi liquidity pool.  In turn, the wealth of public data about crypto wallet activity makes for more sophisticated prospecting.  ""A lot of our clients are looking for Web3-native ways to target new users,"" said A.J. Banon, general partner at Serotonin, a marketing agency that will buy ads on the network on behalf of crypto projects. He gave a hypothetical example of a project that wants to sell fashion-related NFTs for 0.05 ether {{ETH}} a pop.  ""A traditional way of targeting someone might be to find out who follows Louis Vuitton on Twitter, and also follows a Web3 account,"" Banon said. That's crude compared to what you can do with on-chain data: search for users who have minted an NFT in a given time period (the last 24 hours, say); whittle the results down to those who paid something close to the project's target price; of the remaining 50,000 users, whittle it down further to 12,000 who have fashion NFTs in their wallets.  ""Now, we have a really targetable audience that we have a high degree of confidence is going to convert,"" Banon.  What's in it for publishers  Referring to wallets as publishers might sound odd. But Garcia Martinez, who worked in the early 2010s as Facebook's first ad targeting manager, sees these services quickly evolving into portals to Web3, as Yahoo was for Web1 in the late-1990s. Like Yahoo, they can make money on ads, to supplement their transaction fee revenues.  The wallet business has become ""super-competitive,"" so providers are ""super-motivated to become more than a transaction app,"" Garcia Martinez said. ""I think you're gonna start seeing a lot of social experiences and transactional wallets kind of come together.""  On this side of this market, the new network's flagship participants are Collab.land and Daylight, which will sell ad inventory on behalf of crypto wallet services, Garcia Martinez said. (He said he couldn't identify the wallet providers themselves.)  Traditional publishers, such as crypto news sites, can also use the network, he said; Decrypt and RugRadio have done test campaigns.  Collab.land is best known for its integrations that allow users to sign in with their wallets to crypto communities' token-gated websites, Discord servers, Telegram channels and the like; on its website it boasts more than 10 million wallet connections. Daylight brings another 5 million active wallet addresses across its partners, Garcia Martinez said.  What's different, what's next  Other ad networks claim to be native to Web3, but ""there's nothing Web3 about them,"" Garcia Martinez said. ""They just have some crypto publishers they resell inventory for. There's nothing actually going on on-chain.""  Spindl has no plans to issue a token for the network, though Garcia Martinez wouldn't rule it out. For now, payment can be made in stablecoins like USDC, or other existing tokens.  Neither is the network tied to any one blockchain. The choice of chain depends on where the advertiser wants to track events or payouts, Garcia Martinez said. Most clients are using Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible chains, or their own chains, he said.  At the moment, Spindl is the network's sole attribution provider, verifying that an ad impression led to a conversion, thus acting as the smart contract's oracle, for a cut of the revenue. In the coming months, Garcia Martinez said, he aims to open the network to rivals.  ""It's a real mentality shift for us to go from a world where we're ruthlessly competing … and suddenly I have to put on my little protocol hat and say, 'welcome' to a lot of these companies,"" he said. ""But that's the way it is.""

The recent non-fungible token (NFT) boom, which Bitski enthusiastically supported, saw an expansion of the Web3 ecosystem towards mainstream users, and with it usability challenges particularly when using mobile devices. Embedded wallets solve some of the issues around adoption, said Phantom's head of growth David Wu.  “In the future, we think embedded wallets really make sense for decentralized applications, rather than being forced to build their own or use less trusted firms or experimental products,” said Wu in an interview. “With Bitski's expertise in embedded wallets, onboarding will be much easier. Instead of telling people to download a separate mobile app, and adopt a seed phrase, simply sign up with an email and get started immediately.”  Piggybacking on renewed interest in Solana, Phantom has seen its user base double over the past three months to 7 million monthly active users, Wu said. Early in 2022, Phantom raised $109 million at a $1.2 billion valuation.",POSITIVE,없음,SOL | SPONSORED,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/05/21/solana-based-wallet-phantom-buys-web3-specialist-bitski,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1a4944762c9eca4cb1a5f514b391776eb70e9126-1439x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In the last day alone, over $330 million was liquidated from the crypto market and the majority of this has been from short traders who expect prices to fall once again. Over 78,000 Traders Liquidated For $330 Million Coinglass data shows that the last 24 hours have been brutal for crypto traders. In this short time, more than 78,000 crypto traders have seen their positions liquidated, leading to hundreds of millions of dollars in losses. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Investors Are Dumping Amid Jump To $67,000, Why This Is Good For Price In total, there have been $330 million in liquidations. Out of this figure, 81.42% were positions belonging to short traders, meaning they made up $268.76 million of the total figure. Long traders only made up $61.31 million in the liquidations. Contrary to the established trend, Bitcoin did not lead liquidations this time around, instead falling behind Ethereum. This is understandable as the Ethereum price had risen over 20% in the 24-hour period, whereas the Bitcoin price maintained gains of around 6%. Ethereum liquidations accounted for around 32% of the total figure, coming out to $105.13 million at the time of writing. The largest single liquidation event also happened on an ETH-USDT pair on the Huobi exchange, costing the trader $3.11 million. In constrast, Bitcoin liquidations came out to $96.53 million, but just like Ethereum, the figure was made up by a majority of short traders. Following behind Bitcoin is Solana with liquidations of $21.53 million. Other coins which saw substantial liquidations include Dogecoin with $7.42 million and PEPE with $4.3 million. Bitcoin And Ethereum Lead Market Rally The market rally that has shaken the market in the last day has mostly been led by Ethereum, with Bitcoin throwing in support.

42418195,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTckhR,1716293024,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Hits $71K as Ether ETF Hopes Build,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin rose above $71,000 during the European morning after analysts saw the possibility of an ether ETF being approved in the U.S. improving. BTC has climbed nearly 6% in the last 24 hours, eclipsing $71,000 for the first time since early April. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), which offers a broad measurement of the digital asset market, rose more than 8.5% while ETH jumped almost 20% to over $3,700. The market movements caused more than $260 million in short liquidations, the most since Feb. 28. Ether shorts lost over $115 million, followed by bitcoin shorts at just over $99 million, Coinglass data shows.  ETH has been buoyed by favorable regulatory developments that seem to indicate increasing chances of spot ether ETFs being approved by the SEC after the regulator asked exchanges to update 19b-4 filings, which propose rule changes. As a result, the ether implied volatility curve, which shows market expectations of future volatility across different strike prices and expirations, flattened as 25-delta risk reversals hit year-to-date highs above 18%, and traders heavily bought $4,000 calls for 24 May and 31 May, Presto Research analysts wrote. A Polymarket contract asking if an ether ETF would be approved by May 31 jumped from 10 cents to 55 cents, representing a 55% chance that approval will take place by then.  Meme coins on the Ethereum ecosystem like MOG and PEPE surged on the increasing likelihood of ether ETFs being approved. Meme tokens are often seen as a leveraged way to bet on the growth of their underlying blockchain. MOG rose nearly 50% while PEPE climbed over 20%. “Established memes are generally high beta for the native token of the chain they’re on, and Mog has established itself as a winner on Ethereum,” Viro, a Mog core team member, said in an interview over Telegram. “I think the market sees that there’s quite a lot of room to catch up to Pepe, and that’s why you see the outperformance. If you think memes are good beta; you’ll go for the higher caps like pepe or you’ll slide further down the curve for mog.”  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the most traded ether options on the crypto exchange Deribit in the past 24 hours.  Call options at strikes well above ether's going market rate and expiring at the end of May and June have been in demand in a sign of bullish market sentiment.  A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market.

42418177,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTckSz,1716291615,Fidelity Drops Staking Plans in Updated Ether ETF Filing,"Fidelity has amended its S-1 filing with the SEC, indicating that it will not stake ether in its proposed spot exchange-traded fund.  Staking involves locking cryptocurrencies to support blockchain operations in return for rewards, with annualized yields on ether staking currently around 3%.  An S-1 update filed to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission early Tuesday showed that Fidelity has rolled back plans to stake ether (ETH) holdings in its proposed spot exchange-traded fund (ETF).  In previous filings, the firm said it intended to “stake a portion of the trust’s assets” to “one or more” infrastructure providers. However, it clearly stated in Tuesday’s update that it would “not stake the ether” stored with the custodian.  Staking is the process of locking certain cryptocurrencies for a set period of time to help support the operation of a blockchain, in turn, for a reward. These rewards are largely considered passive income among crypto traders.  Data from popular staking service Lido shows that annualized yields on ether staking were nearly 3% as of Tuesday.

28209898,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=609075,1716289252,Crypto Expert Predicts: These 8 Altcoins ‘Will Make You Rich’,"In a new YouTube analysis released to his 502,000 followers, crypto strategist Miles Deutscher shared his insights on the evolving landscape of crypto investments. Deutscher’s discourse delved deep into the inefficacies of traditional venture capital (VC) investment models in the crypto space and proposed an alternative strategy focusing on certain altcoins which he believes are poised for significant growth. Deutscher criticized the conventional VC-backed token launches, stating, “VCs get in at super low valuations Then, when these tokens launch, they’re incentivized to launch them as high as possible in fully diluted valuation terms.” This practice, he argued, results in launch prices that are too steep, blocking effective price discovery mechanisms essential for healthy market participation by retail investors.The subsequent overvaluation typically leads to rapid price declines as initial investors quickly sell off their holdings to realize gains. Highlighting a shift in market dynamics, Deutscher pointed out that meme coins have gained popularity as a form of retaliation against the VC-dominated ecosystem. “People do feel like the game has been rigged and they want to gain an edge,” he explained. According to him, the success of meme coins can be attributed to their generally fairer launch processes compared to traditional VC-funded tokens. To 8 Altcoins To Buy Now Throughout his video, Deutscher listed eight altcoins that align with this new investment “meta,” emphasizing tokens that are “fully diluted and have equally good narratives.” Each coin is selected based on its tokenomics, Fully Diluted Valuation” (FDV), market position, and potential for growth without significant sell pressure from initial large holders: Related Reading: BitMEX Founder Predicts The Dawn Of ‘Crypto Valhalla’: When Will It Start? Solana (SOL): Deutscher views Solana as a leader due to its technological prowess and significant community backing. It has shown resilience and innovation, making it one of his largest holdings due to consistent outperformance. “Solana has climbed to be one of my biggest holdings due to its outperformance. It’s a leader in the market for a reason, and congrats to everyone that’s gotten on board the Solana train with me.” Ton (TON): TON’s attractive FDV ratio suggests a stable market entry with less speculative risk compared to other high-valuation launches. Deutscher highlights its potential for growth without overwhelming sell pressure. He stated: “TON, being another layer one, is not just another blockchain. Okay, it’s relatively highly valued, but it’s mostly diluted in the market, which is good. Its FDV ratio is actually 68, so it’s a stable investment.” NEAR Protocol (NEAR): NEAR is emphasized as a strong AI proxy due to its technological foundation and leadership. Its high level of dilution (91% FDV) means most tokens are in circulation, reducing sell pressure. “NEAR comes in at a whopping 91% fully diluted, which means there isn’t much sell pressure. I do think NEAR is one of the top L1s, especially acting as a very strong AI proxy because the founder has his roots in AI,” Deutscher remarked. Injective Protocol (INJ): With a 94% market cap to FDV ratio, INJ is seen as having robust market health and less price suppression from unlocks. Deutscher believes it is poised for resurgence based on its strong fundamentals and recent market behaviors. “Injective has a 94% market cap to FDV ratio, which is really impressive and is one that outperformed earlier in the year but has just started to stagnate a bit. I think at some point, this is definitely going to rear its head again as a narrative,” he stated. Related Reading: Cardano Founder Predicts Crypto As Election Game-Changer: Impact On Price Arweave (AR): Deutscher praises Arweave as one of the top infrastructure plays, not just for data storage but also for its potential integration with AI. The fact that it’s fully diluted means minimal sell pressure moving forward. “Arweave positions itself as one of the top infrastructure plays. It’s still not a crazy FDV at 3.1, considering it has a 100% circulating market cap, which means all of the unlocks have taken place.” AIOZ Network (AIOZ): AIOZ fits into the AI and decentralized content narrative with its unique offering in decentralized streaming and storage solutions. The fully diluted status of AIOZ tokens makes them particularly appealing.”AIOZ is another coin that is fully diluted in the market. It’s a coin in the deep tech/AI sector. I like what they’re building and it also includes decentralized storage, but also it’s decentralized AI compute network,” Deutscher explained. WIF: Dogwifhat’s fair launch process and full dilution are major pluses, helping it to achieve strong price performance without the usual VC-induced sell pressure, according to Deutscher. PEPE: Deutscher has personally seen substantial returns from Pepe, noting its recent “healthy cool off” as an opportune time for accumulation. The coin’s community-driven approach and meme status offer unique market resilience. “Pepe is another leading meme coin in my opinion. Very healthy cool off and one that I’m welcoming as someone that would like to get more exposure,” he revealed. High Potential Cryptos With Low Float, High FDV Deutscher also discussed the potential of investing in low float, high FDV tokens under specific conditions. Using Ondo Finance (ONDO) as a case study, he detailed how a deep understanding of tokenomics could reveal hidden opportunities. “ONDO’s vesting schedule is public, showing that most insiders are locked till 2025, minimizing sell pressure and allowing for price appreciation,” he noted. Concluding his analysis, Deutscher urged his viewers to adopt a nuanced investment strategy that leverages both market trends and in-depth token analysis. He emphasized the importance of buying during periods of “extreme fear” and selling during “extreme greed” to maximize returns. At press time, SOL traded at $183.33.

42418193,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTckdJ,1716288712,"Ether ETF Speculation Could Weigh on SOL, Wider Altcoin Market","Renewed hopes of an ether ETF debut in the U.S. is likely to see investors take money out of SOL and other alternative cryptocurrencies to invest into ETH.  Approval of a spot ether ETF is likely to broaden mainstream demand for crypto in the long run.  The crypto bull run that began last October has been characterized by Ethereum's ether {{ETH}} token underperforming rival layer 1 coins such as SOL, BNB and market leader bitcoin {{BTC}}.  That, however, could change in the coming weeks, with ether overtaking the others on renewed hopes that a spot ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) will be approved in the U.S., opening the doors to a deluge of institutional money.  Late Monday, CoinDesk reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had asked firms looking to list and trade ether ETFs to update and refile documents necessary to secure regulatory approval. Around the same time, Bloomberg's ETF analysts raised the probability of the approval to 75% from 25%.  ""ETH has been a de-facto funding token of this bull cycle, similar to the low-yielding Japanese yen in the currency market. With renewed hopes of a spot ETH ETF, traders would want to square off their ETH shorts vs SOL and other tokens,"" Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex Solutions, said in an interview. ""The unwinding of shorts will happen over time, ensuring ether outperformance in the near-term.""  Though approval is not guaranteed , the signs of progress contrast starkly with the pessimism early this year that saw investors prefer BTC, SOL and others over the ether.  Nearly a dozen spot bitcoin ETFs began trading in the U.S. mid-January, putting the leading cryptocurrency at the forefront of mainstream institutional adoption. Furthermore, in the first quarter, investors increasingly flocked to cheaper and faster programmable blockchains like Solana, strengthening the bullish case for their native tokens.  That meant investors had an incentive to sell ether and buy SOL, BTC and other coins much as in forex markets investors sold the yen in favor of relatively high-yielding currencies like the dollar, euro and British pound. The SOL-ETH ratio has risen by 287% since October, and the ETH-BTC ratio has declined by 16.6%, according to TradingView.  That's no longer the case. The potential introduction of an ether ETF would put the cryptocurrency in a completely different category from SOL and other tokens. As such, the ETF speculation could see investors rotate money out of alternative cryptocurrencies and into ether. The token has rallied more than SOL, BTC and others in the past 24 hours.  ""This ETH move might be just getting started,"" Solot said. ""There could be waves of short covering as nobody would want to be short ETH going through an ETF approval.""  Long-term bias unchanged  Derivatives market activity suggests investors are yet to price in ether leadership over the long term.  ""The derivatives market believes that the current jump in ether is more likely caused by speculative sentiment. The front end of the ETH/BTC forward exchange rate term structure has seen some contango, but the back end remains in backwardation. This implies that investors have not changed their views on the long-term performance of ETH compared to BTC,"" said Griffin Ardern, head of options trading and research at crypto financial platform BloFin, in a Telegram chat.  That's consistent with analysts' view that ether ETFs will not hurt demand for bitcoin ETFs over the long run.  ""I don't see spot ETH ETFs draining funds from BTC ETFs,"" Noelle Acheson, author of the popular Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, told CoinDesk. ""There may be some churn, but approval of the spot ETH ETFs is more likely to broaden the mainstream demand rather than channel it, with many investors seeing the ETH ETFs as a diversifier of the crypto portion of portfolios.""  Acheson added that the jump in overall crypto interest should continue to boost both, especially as investors become familiar with the different narratives and likely use cases.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH | SOL,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | SOL,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/21/ether-etf-speculation-could-weigh-on-sol-wider-altcoin-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6923046d9a52fac72269f7dd0d26ff84da658711-3240x1823.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ether Capital currently derives revenue from staking Ethereum on its balance sheet, but returns are dependent on the price of Ethereum and staking yields. The company's shares have historically traded at a discount to the value of its Ethereum assets, but the discount has closed considerably since the announcement of the ETF conversion. Ether Capital Corporation ( ETHC:CA )( DTSRF ) has been one of the more slept-on gems in the cryptocurrency investment space for the last several years. Given the company's small market cap relative to other companies in the space and its primary focus on Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), Ether Capital has regularly traded at a large discount to the value of the assets on the balance sheet. I've personally held this company's stock in the past and even highlighted it for my no longer active Seeking Alpha investor group BlockChain Reaction. Data by YCharts Up until recently, ETHC shares have generally traded in-line with the price of Ethereum. In the chart above, we can observe a clear divergence between the two at the beginning of May. The large increase in the price of ETHC shares relative to ETH is attributable to the company's May 2nd announcement that it has agreed to sell the business to Purpose Investments. From there, the company shares are intended to be converted to an Ethereum Staking ETF utilizing the company's assets. Current Business Model Ether Capital has generally had a straightforward business. As currently constructed, the company derives revenue from staking the Ethereum that is held on the balance sheet and receiving blockchain rewards. Ether Capital isn't the only publicly traded company that does this. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miner and AI compute provider Bit Digital ( BTBT ) also has an Ethereum Staking business as a small tertiary revenue stream. Data by YCharts Since Ethereum staking returns are denominated in ETH, fiat-denominated revenue from staking is dependent on the price of Ethereum and the staking yield from the blockchain. Following Ethereum's migration from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, Ether Capital's staking strategy is far more economical than the energy-intense and machine-heavy Bitcoin mining. Additionally, staking is a rather simple endeavor for those with public blockchain competence and doesn't require much overhead. However, when staking yields are low, the return on capital is not necessarily strong. Trailing twelve months Ether Capital's ROTC is just 1% per data from Seeking Alpha. As for the Ethereum network itself, staking yields have historically been much higher and have occasionally eclipsed 7%: Ethereum Staking Rewards (IntoTheBlock) More recently, we've seen annualized staking rewards decline from about 3.8% the week prior to Ethereum's Dencun upgrade to under 3% so far through the month of May. And even the pre-Dencun yield figures were well below the 4-7% annualized yields from ETH staking during much of late-2022 and the first half of 2023. The long-term trend in staking yield is lower. Thus, the crossroads for Ether Capital. ETF Conversion And Arbitrage As mentioned in the introduction, ETHC shares have generally traded at a discount to the value of the Ethereum assets on the balance sheet - at times that discount has been as high as 40%. In late 2023 , the company announced former CEO Brian Mosoff stepping down and co-founder Som Seif stepping in as interim CEO. Following the conclusion of a strategic review, Ether Capital disclosed the plan to transition the company to an Ethereum Staking ETF: After considering various alternatives during its strategic review, including continuing under its existing corporate structure and focusing on maximizing its staking strategy, the Independent Committee and the Board concluded that converting into an ETF is the most advantageous strategy for the Corporation and its Shareholders. Following this announcement, the price of ETHC quickly rallied nearly 30% in a single session: Data by YCharts The discount arbitrage trade has now closed considerably, but there is actually still some meat on the bone. As of March 31st, 2024, Ether Capital has 46,274 ETH on the balance sheet - 98% of which is staked. At a $3,100 ETH price, the market value of the Ether Capital's ETH assets is currently $143.4 million. Given 32.8 million shares outstanding, if we value ETHC shares at the market value of the underlying ETH, ETHC shares are worth about $4.37 USD per share. As of article submission, ETHC shares are trading at $4.97 CAD, or $3.65 USD - which is still a 16% discount to the market value of the ETH on the balance sheet by my calculations. Risks As I see it, the primary risk in longing ETHC for the arbitrage opportunity is the exposure to ETH. Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and companies that rely on cryptocurrencies for revenue and/or equity valuation carry considerably more risk than companies that don't. Adding to the possible volatility in ETHC and Ether Capital depository shares is the low trading volume in the company's stock. Additionally, the shareholder meeting in June could theoretically result in a vote against the ETF conversional proposal. In my view, a vote against the ETF proposal is unlikely, as it would possibly result in a share price discount back to pre-conversion-news levels. Finally, there is the risk that regulators may not approve the conversion. The TSX already has several Ethereum ETFs, but as far as I can tell none of them are actively staking the ETH within the funds. This would make ETHC's ETF conversion slightly different from the products already on the market. Summary In my view, Ether Capital is yet another crypto arbitrage trade that could bear fruit for patient share buyers. Given the relative illiquidity of the shares, I would personally only use limit orders when building a position. That said, I'm not currently long Ether Capital because I like other arbitrage opportunities in the market a bit more. Specifically, the 42% discount in the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund ( GDLC ) and the 8% discount in the Osprey Bitcoin Fund ( OBTC ).",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4694723-ether-capital-etf-conversion-and-valuation-to-eth?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/28209434.jpeg

The gains came after Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart updated the odds of approval to 75% from 20% on Monday, causing a market-wide jump. Ether rose over 17%, while bitcoin retook the $71,000 mark for the first time since early April.  “Established memes are generally high beta for the native token of the chain they’re on, and Mog has established itself as a winner on Ethereum while still trading at a fraction of the next biggest meme (Pepe),” a Mog core team member said in an interview over Telegram.  “I think the market sees that there’s quite a lot of room to catch up to Pepe, and that’s why you see the outperformance. If you think memes are good beta; you’ll go for the higher caps like pepe or you’ll slide further down the curve for mog.”  The focus on meme coins as a way of betting on growth isn't unique to Ethereum. Several Solana-based meme coin tokens surged from December to March as the network’s SOL tokens took off – contributing to ecosystem growth and attention. Also in December, the Avalanche Foundation, a non-profit that maintains the Avalanche blockchain, said it would invest in meme tokens built on the network in recognition of the online culture and memetic value that such tokens can drive among investors.",POSITIVE,ETH | SHIB | PEPE | MOG,AVAX | ETH | SHIB | PEPE | MOG,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/21/mog-pepe-rocket-as-traders-search-for-ether-beta-bets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9cec511dc7142e3298608f2bdaa37966a00165c7-1262x710.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

28202647,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=609055,1716277522,BitMEX Founder Predicts The Dawn Of ‘Crypto Valhalla’: When Will It Start?,"In his latest essay titled “The Easy Button,” Arthur Hayes, founder of the crypto exchange BitMEX, delves into the dynamics of global monetary policies and their consequential ties to what he describes as the impending ‘Crypto Valhalla.’ Hayes analyzes the policy maneuvers of the world’s major economies, notably Japan, the United States, and China, and their effects on the crypto landscape. The Dawn Of Crypto Valhalla Hayes outlines the Federal Reserve’s potential strategy in coordination with the US Treasury to engage in unlimited dollar-for-yen swaps with the Bank of Japan (BOJ). This measure aims to manipulate exchange rates to stabilize the yen without causing disruptive economic shifts. Hayes states, “The Fed, acting on orders from the Treasury, can legally swap dollars for yen in unlimited amounts for as long as they wish with the BOJ.” This tactic, according to Hayes, is designed to avert immediate financial crises by deferring hard economic decisions. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Sounds Warning Alarm For Potential 50-60% Crash In Chainlink Price, Here’s Why The implications for Japan’s economy are stark, with Hayes predicting severe consequences should the BOJ decide to raise interest rates: “If the BOJ raises interest rates, it commits seppuku,” Hayes notes, using the Japanese term for ritual suicide to underscore the potential self-destructive economic impact, given that the BOJ is the largest holder of Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) and would incur massive losses. The devaluation of the yen has also significant ramifications for China’s global economic competitiveness, especially in exports. Hayes discusses how a weaker yen harms China’s export economy by making Japanese goods cheaper internationally, directly competing with Chinese products. He suggests that the People’s Bank of China might respond by devaluing the yuan to maintain competitive balance. “If the yen keeps weakening, China will respond by devaluing the yuan,” Hayes predicts, outlining a potential economic tit-for-tat that could destabilize global markets. Hayes further theorizes about a dramatic monetary policy shift in China involving its substantial gold reserves. He posits that China could use these reserves to peg the yuan to gold, thereby creating a new economic landscape. “China is estimated to have stockpiled over 31,000 tonnes of gold I believe that for domestic and foreign political reasons, China wishes to keep the dollar-yuan rate stable.” By pegging the yuan to gold, China could potentially insulate itself from currency fluctuations and exert greater control over its economic destiny. The essay also touches on the intersection of US politics and economic policy, particularly in light of the approaching presidential election. Hayes speculates that domestic economic pressures, such as job losses and the reshoring of manufacturing, could significantly influence the Biden administration’s policy decisions. Related Reading: Cardano Founder Predicts Crypto As Election Game-Changer: Impact On Price He argues that the administration may avoid aggressive moves against China to prevent a backlash in pivotal states: “Biden must win these battleground states to keep the Orange Man at bay. Biden cannot afford a yuan devaluation before the election.” Hayes suggests that these global currency maneuvers could lead to a bullish scenario for cryptocurrencies. He advises crypto traders and institutional investors to monitor the USDJPY exchange rate closely, asserting that significant movements could indicate shifts favorable to crypto valuations. “Watch the USDJPY rate closer than Solana devs monitor uptime,” he advises, highlighting the potential for substantial financial opportunities in the cryptocurrency space.On the timing of a potential “Crypto Valhalla,” Hayes speculates that the pace of yen depreciation will accelerate into the fall. “This will put pressure on the US, Japan, and China to do something. The US election is a crucial motivating factor for the Biden administration to come up with some solution.” According to Hayes, a USDJPY surge towards 200 is “enough to put on the Chemical Brothers and ‘Push the Button.’ This analogy to the Chemical Brothers’ song underscores the urgency and drastic nature of the action required to counter such a currency imbalance. “If my theory becomes reality, it is trivial for any institutional investor to buy one of the US-listed Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin is the best-performing asset in the face of global fiat debasement, and they know it. When something is done about the weak yen, I will mathematically guestimate how flows into the Bitcoin complex will ratchet the price to $1 million and possibly beyond. Stay imaginative, stay boolish, now is not the time to be a cuck,” Hayes concludes. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $70,835.

The increase is a sign of investor hopes that the SEC will approve spot ether ETFs.  Ether {{ETH}} futures are more popular than ever, following the sudden, positive turnaround in sentiment concerning the potential approval of spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S.  Notional open interest, or the dollar value locked in the number of active ether futures contracts, climbed 25% to a record $14.05 billion in the past 24 hours, according to data source Coinglass. The previous lifetime peak of $13.2 billion dates back to March 15.  The increase is a sign of a renewed influx of money into the ether market, mainly on the bullish side, as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap added almost 19% to $3,680, according to CoinDesk data. The uptick in open interest alongside a price rise is said to confirm the uptrend.  Late Monday, Bloomberg's ETF analysts increased the probability of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) green lighting the spot ETH ETFs to 75% from 25%. Meanwhile, CoinDesk reported that the SEC had asked exchanges looking to list and trade potential spot ether ETFs to update 19b-4 filings on an accelerated basis, a sign of the regulator attempting to fast-track the process.

Talks about the coin are thriving and have reached their highest point since early April, despite an 8% price decline over the last 60 days. This raises the question of whether the recent internet talk will help XRP see a price spike or if it is just meaningless chatter that will eventually fade. Related Reading: Solana Blasts Past Resistance: Buckle Up For $330 Breakout – Analyst Social Media Frenzy The social media landscape surrounding XRP is abuzz. Santiment data reveals a surge in XRP’s social dominance, meaning conversations about XRP are outpacing chatter on other cryptocurrencies. This digital watercooler effect has historically correlated with price increases. In December 2023 and March 2024, similar spikes in social media buzz preceded XRP’s jumps to $0.66 and $0.71 respectively. Enthusiasts are hoping this trend holds true, potentially pushing the price back to the $0.70 mark. However, some analysts are throwing cold water on this social media frenzy. While the chatter is undeniable, the sentiment behind it seems less than enthusiastic. Santiment’s Weighted Sentiment metric paints a picture of a lukewarm market, with a reading of minus 0.78 indicating a slightly negative overall view. This negativity could dampen any potential price rise fueled by social media hype. Technical Outlook: Golden Cross Or Grim Reaper’s Embrace? Technical analysis, the art of deciphering price charts for clues, paints a mixed picture for XRP. On the bullish side, a recent “golden cross” has emerged, where the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) crosses above the 50-day EMA. This is traditionally seen as a bullish signal, suggesting a potential price increase. If XRP can conquer the resistance level at $0.56, a surge towards the coveted $0.70 price point might be in the cards. Meanwhile, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is currently negative, suggesting a lack of clear dominance by the bulls. This technical tug-of-war could see XRP retreat to the $0.50 support level before any potential rebound. Related Reading: Solana Leaves Competition In The Dust: Blazing Speed To Fuel Price Surge? The Verdict: Buckle Up For A Bumpy Ride The future of XRP seems to be hanging in the balance. Social media buzz suggests a potential price surge, but negative sentiment and murky technical indicators cast shadows of doubt. Investors should buckle up for a potentially bumpy ride. While a price increase to $0.70 is not out of the realm of possibility, a drop to $0.50 or even lower cannot be entirely discounted.

Bloomberg analysts raised the approval odds to 75%, boosting market sentiment.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} surged over $71,000 early Tuesday, its highest since early April, as ether surged over 19% to $3,700 after Bloomberg analysts raised the probability that spot ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF) gets approved in the U.S. to 75%.  Other majors chalked out relatively smaller gains, with XRP, Cardano's ADA, Solana's SOL and dogecoin (DOGE) rising between 3-6%, as per CoinGecko data.  The sudden move up caused over $260 million in market-wide short liquidations, the biggest since Feb.28. Ether shorts lost over $115 million, followed by bitcoin shorts at just over $99 million, Coinglass data shows.  Crypto exchange Binance logged over $130 million in liquidations, the largest among counterparts, followed by OKX at $118 million and Huobi at $51 million.  Shorts are bets against higher price movements. Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader's initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).  Markets started to rally late Monday as Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart raised the odds of a spot ether ETF to 75% from the early 20%. Later, CoinDesk reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked aspiring ether exchange-traded fund exchanges to update 19b-4 filings ahead of a key deadline this week.  Market participants consider the approval of an ether ETF to be a bullish event, opening the floodgates to institutional capital. The spot bitcoin ETF, which started trading in January, has racked up $12 billion in total inflows for BTC, with top trading firms and state funds among its holders.  Meanwhile, some traders expect ether prices to rise further in the coming days.  “Our view is that it is unlikely that spot can settle here, with approval taking us closer to 4k and denial back to 3k,” Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a Tuesday broadcast. “Exchanges are being asked to update 19b-4 filings on an accelerated basis, suggesting approval is imminent.”",POSITIVE,ADA | BTC,ADA | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/21/bitcoin-surges-over-71k-as-ether-etf-hopes-lead-to-260m-in-short-liquidations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a922c6681d614e10c31c57e38c7e85b426b7a9ae-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The office of the New York Attorney General announced today that a state court had approved a $2 billion settlement with bankrupt crypto lender Genesis.  In October 2023, the NYAG sued Genesis, Gemini, and Digital Currency Group for allegedly defrauding more than $1 billion from over 230,000 investors, including 29,000 New Yorkers.  The NYAG claimed Gemini knew Genesis’ loans were undersecured and concentrated with Alameda Research but did not disclose this to investors.  “This historic settlement is a major step toward ensuring the victims who invested in Genesis have a semblance of justice,"" Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. ""Once again, we see the real-world consequences and detrimental losses that can happen because of a lack of oversight and regulation within the cryptocurrency industry.”  Genesis neither admits nor denies the allegations outlined in the suit.

Digital Currency Group (DCG), which was part of the initial suit by the NYAG, but was excluded from the settlement, but had objected to the process earlier.

FIT21, supported by digital asset organizations like Coinbase, provides a regulatory framework, defining digital assets and expanding CFTC authority.  House Financial Services Committee Ranking Member Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and House Agriculture Committee Ranking Member David Scott (D-Ga.) – the leading Democrats on their respective committees – have sent an email to Democratic members of the House of Representatives saying they ""strongly oppose"" H.R. 4763, the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21). While the House Democratic Whip is not whipping their members against the bill, Politico reported, Waters herself is soliciting no votes.  Waters and Scott say they oppose the bill because it undermines established legal precedents and creates uncertainty in the traditional securities market.  ""This language undermines decades of legal precedent and case law, thereby creating uncertainty in our traditional securities market,"" the Democrat Whip's office wrote in an email, first obtained by Politico.  The email says that the bill provides a safe harbor in which entities can file an ""intent to register"" if they meet certain requirements, which, they argue, shields them from securities laws rules and regulations until the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) finalize new rules.  All of this ""weakens investor protections and opens the door to fraud and market manipulation,"" the email said.  A ""Dear Colleague"" letter posted to the House Financial Services Committee's Democrats page delves deeper into the two leaders' opposition to the bill, referring to it as the ""not fit for purpose act.""  A numbered list said the bill would create a ""pathway for 'investment contract assets' with no alternate regulator, meaning that virtually no laws or regulations would govern them.""  A Democrat aide told CoinDesk lawmakers would have a briefing with the SEC on Tuesday morning.  The bill, if signed into law, would block shareholders from being able to sue publicly traded companies, preempt state regulations around digital assets, weaken fiduciary requirements and undermine capital markets, the letter said.  The email from the Democratic Whip's office also urged lawmakers to vote against H.R. 192, a bill introduced by Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) to block the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency. The bill has an ""overly broad definition"" for CBDCs, the email said, and ""raises concerns the bill could undermine the Fed's ability to conduct monetary policy.""  FIT21 is supported by a coalition of digital assets organizations and companies, including Coinbase, Kraken, Andreessen Horowitz and 50 others, as it provides a regulatory framework for the digital assets industry, its supporters say, which is something the U.S. currently lacks.  The bill creates a definition for whether a digital asset is a security or a commodity, expands the CFTC's authority to register and regulate digital commodities, and requires the CFTC and SEC to jointly issue rules for assets not otherwise classified.

28195632,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=609044,1716266382,Solana Leaves Competition In The Dust: Blazing Speed To Fuel Price Surge?,"Solana (SOL), the self-proclaimed “world’s fastest blockchain,” has been grabbing headlines for its blazing transaction speeds and surging token price. But is it all sunshine and rainbows in Solana land, or are there cracks in the seemingly smooth road? Related Reading: Solana Blasts Past Resistance: Buckle Up For $330 Breakout – Analyst Solana Takes The TPS Crown According to CoinGecko data, Solana blew past competitors like Polygon and Ethereum in transactions per second (TPS). This translates to faster transaction processing times, a key factor for scalability and mass adoption in the blockchain world. However, a closer look reveals a more nuanced picture. While daily active addresses, which represent unique users interacting with the network, have indeed increased, the daily transaction count hasn’t kept pace. This suggests a scenario where more users are entering the Solana ecosystem, but they aren’t necessarily conducting a high volume of transactions. Is this a case of casual crypto tourists dipping their toes in, or is there something else at play? Fees Take A Tumble, But Is It A Sustainable Slide? Another interesting wrinkle is the decline in transaction fees on Solana. This might seem like good news for users, but it could be a double-edged sword. Lower fees could indicate that the transactions being processed are less complex and require lower charges. This could potentially limit Solana’s revenue generation in the long run. Additionally, a drop in fees could signal a decrease in network congestion, which might explain the stagnant daily transaction count. DeFi Keeps The Party Going, But Caution Flickers A bright spot for Solana is the continued growth in its Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Total Value Locked (TVL). DeFi refers to a suite of financial services built on blockchains, and TVL represents the total value of crypto assets deposited in DeFi protocols. Solana’s rising TVL indicates its growing adoption within the DeFi space, where users can lock up their crypto to earn interest or participate in other financial activities. This is a positive sign for the overall health of the Solana ecosystem. Related Reading: Litecoin Put To The Test: Can LTC Break Through $94? However, a note of caution emerges from technical indicators like the Money Flow Index (MFI). This indicator suggests a potential price correction for SOL, hinting that the current uptrend might not be entirely sustainable. Combine this with the mixed signals on network activity and the declining fee structure, and investors are left with a question mark hanging over Solana’s long-term prospects. A Blockchain In High Gear, But the Destination Is Unclear Solana’s impressive transaction speeds and strong DeFi presence are undeniable strengths. However, the network’s overall activity and tokenomics raise questions about its long-term viability. Meanwhile, at the time of writing, SOL was trading at $185, up 7.1% and 26.0% in the daily and weekly timeframes, data from Coingecko shows. This price surge, coupled with the network’s breakneck transaction speeds, paints a picture of a project with immense potential. However, for Solana to truly become a dominant force, it will need to address the questions surrounding its network activity and long-term sustainability, not to mention add more fuel to its price.

This proposed upgrade will reportedly introduce a “high-performance, parallelized” Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to improve the network’s overall functionality. Sei Rolls Out Multi-Phase V2 Upgrade According to the announcement, the Sei V2 launch will be rolled out in three phases to minimize risk, set user expectations, and optimize network performance. “By rolling out Sei v2 in measured steps, Sei Contributors can ensure a stable and scalable network for everyone,” the foundation stated. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Sounds Warning Alarm For Potential 50-60% Crash In Chainlink Price, Here’s Why The first phase will focus on validating software upgrades and transitioning the existing Sei Pacific-1 mainnet to the new “v2” iteration. This will pave the way for deploying EVM-based contracts and infrastructure integrations on the Sei network. The announcement cautioned that “not everything will be functional at the start of this period. “For example, bridges will need time to deploy to Mainnet before the community can use them.” However, the foundation promised to provide an official announcement once the v2 network is deemed stable and critical infrastructure, such as RPCs, bridges, indexers, and multi-sigs, is ready for use. If the governance proposal is accepted, the Sei mainnet upgrade to Version 2 is scheduled for Monday, May 27th. Interestingly, the announcement of the Sei V2 upgrade has already sparked a surge in the blockchain’s native token, SEI, which has emerged as one of the biggest gainers in the market over the past 24 hours, with a price increase of 11%. All Eyes On All-Time High On Mainnet Upgrade Prospects The SEI token is trading at $0.5830, surpassing its previous resistance level of $0.560. This breakthrough aims to consolidate the token’s price above this mark, a key level for the token’s prospects of testing higher resistance walls and potentially reaching its all-time high (ATH) of $1.14, set on March 16. Furthermore, the token has recorded a trading volume of $95 million since the announcement, resulting in a substantial 150% increase compared to the figures recorded during the previous weekend, according to CoinGecko data. Despite these positive developments, it remains to be seen whether the governance proposal to upgrade the Sei blockchain to Version 2 will be approved. Related Reading: Dogwifhat (WIF) Surges 10.4% Amid Whale Frenzy, New ATH Coming Soon? In the event of a bullish outcome and the successful implementation of the V2 upgrade, the key resistance levels to watch on the upside are $0.592, $0.613, and $0.637. These levels could be potential targets for the token’s continued bullish momentum. Conversely, should the token experience a price correction, the $0.544 and $0.527 zones would be the levels to monitor for potential support and stabilization of the SEI price in the coming days.

Litecoin Whales Have Been Making Net Inflows To Their Wallets Recently According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, the Litecoin whales have received large net inflows in their addresses over the past month or so. The on-chain indicator relevant here is the “Large Holders Netflow,” which tracks the net amount of Bitcoin entering into or moving out of the combined wallets of investors owning at least 1% of the cryptocurrency’s circulating supply. Related Reading: Bitcoin “Profit-Taking Has Completed,” Top Analyst Reveals IntoTheBlock defines such “large holders” as the whale entities of the asset. Whales are generally considered to be influential beings on the network, owing to their ability to move large amounts on the network in a short span of time. When the Large Holders Netflow has a positive value, it means that these humongous investors are receiving a net amount of coins into their balance right now. Naturally, such buying can be bullish for the coin’s price. On the other hand, the negative indicator implies the whales are potentially participating in selling currently, which could have bearish consequences for the asset. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Litecoin Large Holders Netflow over the past month: The value of the metric seems to have been positive in recent days | Source: IntoTheBlock on X As displayed in the above graph, the Litecoin Large Holders Netflow has mostly observed positive values inside this window, suggesting that the whales’ wallets have been receiving net deposits. According to the analytics firm, these large holders have accumulated 2,751,633 LTC in the last 30 days. At the current exchange rate of the asset, this stack is worth a whopping $230 million. As the chart also shows, the indicator spiked particularly strongly on the 10th of this month. During these net inflows alone, the whales bought 900,000 LTC, the highest daily amount since February, representing around one-third of the total accumulation in the past month. Related Reading: Chainlink Becomes Crypto Winner With 21% Rally: What’s Driving This? This buying spree from the large holders has come as the asset’s price has been consolidating around its lows following the mid-April crash. Thus, it would imply the whales believe the recent prices of Litecoin to have been worthy entry points into the coin. This could certainly be a bullish sign for the cryptocurrency, so it remains to be seen how the asset’s price will develop in the near future. The indicator may be worth monitoring, though, as its value turning negative could instead spell a bearish outcome for the coin.

Currently, SHIB has seen a modest increase, up by 0.1% over the last 24 hours and 1.6% over the past week. This performance is less pronounced than that of other meme coins like PEPE, BOME, and FLOKI, which have seen increases of 11.6%, 8.9%, and 6.5%, respectively, over the same seven-day period. Meanwhile, the total SHIB burned since the token’s inception now stands at approximately 410.73 trillion SHIB, a significant chunk of the initial quadrillion supply created by the anonymous founder Ryoshi in 2020. The current circulating supply of Shiba Inu is around 582.99 trillion SHIB, with an additional 6.28 trillion SHIB locked in various staking platforms.

This blockchain platform’s total number of transfers has reached 417.50 million, with 1.8 million wallets currently connected. Despite all these, crypto expert Dami Defi has shared an optimistic outlook for Shiba Inu’s price action.
