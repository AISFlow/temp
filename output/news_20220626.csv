Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin fell slightly on Sunday but held steady above $21,000; ether remains over $1,200.  Insights: Solana Web3 phone faces long odds based on the blockchain industry's track record.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.

Although it was down 1% in the last 24 hours, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at over $21,000, still up from the panicky levels it fell to last weekend.  On Sunday, investors continued to find comfort in faint signs that the U.S. economy was cooling and that the Federal Reserve might be able to tone down its monetary hawkishness later in the year. Bitcoin has correlated increasingly to macroeconomic trends, which have become much worse over the past nine months.  Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was changing hands at above $1,200, down about 2.5% during the past day. Trading for both bitcoin and ether was light as is typical on weekends. The bitcoin Fear and Greed Index measuring market sentiment remained well within extreme fear territory.  After bitcoin held steady, analysts had expected that it would dip below $20,000 during the weekend in its tango with forces pushing it above and pulling it under that threshold. Such volatility is likely to continue without a sizable upturn any time soon, said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital.  ""We did see some volatility in BTC prices this week, which was expected; however, BTC has struggled to build on any momentum upward of $20,000, which has kept any chances of a rally at bay,"" DiPasquale wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  Other major altcoins were mixed over the weekend with popular meme coin DOGE rising more than 10% at one point and Monero's privacy coin XRM up nearly 6%. GALA and MANA sank over 8% and 7%. Polygon's MATIC – which rose more than 25% over a 24-hour period starting last Wednesday after the project introduced a new privacy product for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) – fell slightly.  Cryptos' performance has tracked equity indexes, which regained some ground Friday from losses earlier in the month. The S&P 500 rose 3.1% on Friday, its best day in two years, and finished the week up more than 6%, although the index, which contains a heavy tech component, still lingers in bear market territory, meaning that it is down at least 20% from its previous high. The Nasdaq and Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 3.3% and 3%, respectively as investors savored a brief respite from this year's drumbeat of dreary economic news.  A revision in the University of Michigan’s monthly consumer sentiment index now shows expectations for inflation were lower than first reported in May. Sales of existing homes dropped in May, and mortgage applications declined for the week, two trends that underscore the impact of rising interest rates.  Investors will be studying this week's durable goods orders and consumer confidence reports for further signs of the Federal Reserve's success in taming inflation without casting the U.S. economy into a recession.  BitBull's DiPasquale sees bitcoin testing levels below $20,000 in the days ahead as investors continue their wary approach to riskier assets.  ""It is a good sign that BTC is still holding the $20K level, but next week should be more decisive, and we could either see a successful test of the recent lows, which could further cement the $17K-$18K range as a strong support, or witness another breakdown in price,"" he wrote.  Markets  S&P 500: 3,911 +3%  DJIA: 31,500 +2.6%  Nasdaq: 11,607 +3.3%  Gold: $1,827 +0.1%  Insights  Solana Phone Faces Long Odds Based on the Blockchain Industry's Track Record  Solana Labs announced that it’s working on a smartphone. The phone will be available next year and come with “specialty crypto wallet functions and the 'Solana Mobile Stack (SMS)' software development kit for Web3 programs,” according to CoinDesk.  Blockchain phones aren’t exactly new. They have been tried before and didn’t really go anywhere.  Rewind to 2019. It’s no longer the depths of 2018's crypto winter, but a cold and protracted spring.  At the time three companies were working on blockchain phones and promised a big reveal at the Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show in January 2020.  One of them was Taiwan-based HTC – a former giant in the Android phone market that has since faded into obscurity. The other two not so much: Switzerland-based Sirin Labs, which specialized in security-first phones (as of 2022 its website is no longer updated), and crypto payment infrastructure provider Pundi X Labs.  Of the three, HTC had the most practical ""crypto"" product. The phone contained special software that allowed users to store their private crypto keys in a walled garden of the phone’s computer processing unit called the Trust Zone, which can run only preapproved and secure code. This is the same part of the processor where other encryption keys are stored, like those for playing back digital rights-managed video from Netflix, or where biometric data to allow users to open the phone via fingerprint or face ID.  Sirin Labs’ Finney Phone attempted to do the same – secure storage of private keys – but via an external dongle. In contrast, Pundi X was focused on building a universe of decentralized applications (dapps) that gave users the ability to make phone calls via a protocol secured by its blockchain.  All failed to resonate with consumers.  HTC’s plans were disrupted by Samsung, which offered the same functionality on an app in its much more popular Galaxy line of smartphones. Sirin Labs’ Finney Phone got hit by poor reviews, and the project seems to have been abandoned as recent Amazon reviews report that the apps no longer work. Pundi X’s required network effect never took off as people didn’t seem to buy in to the benefits of blockchain.  All these prior blockchain phones failed because the market realized a specialized phone isn't needed for any of this. The functionality is available already on apps that can be loaded onto any old phone.  The Saga phone’s Web3 dapp store, Solana Pay apps, and “seed vault” mobile key storage are just apps and can be installed already on an existing phone. This product might be a must-have for Solana fans and true believers, but the actual builders and power users of blockchain already do everything on their existing smartphones.

25281,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=241009,1656281925,The Top Five Algorithmic Stablecoins Explained in Detail,"The key factor behind a stablecoin&apos;s rising appeal in the cryptocurrency community is the practice of pegging it to an underlying asset. Stablecoins that use algorithms that don&apos;t have any collateral or low collateral associated with them are called algorithmic stablecoins. The term &apos;non-collateralized&apos; stablecoins is used to describe them as a result. Algorithmic Stablecoins are designed to increase market price stability without the need for a central authority and are decentralized. This is frequently accomplished by pre-programming the supply to match the demand for the asset. If you&apos;ve been planning to invest in algorithmic stablecoins, this guide on the top five algorithmic stablecoins could come in handy for you. So. let&apos;s take a look at the top 5 algorithmic stablecoins in the market. 1. FRAX The first stablecoin protocol using a fractional algorithm is Frax. It is one of the best algorithmic stablecoins. Frax is now implemented on Ethereum and 12 other chains and is open-source, permissionless, and on-chain. The aim of the Frax protocol is to replace digital assets with a fixed supply, like BTC, with a highly scalable, decentralized, algorithmic currency. Two stablecoins, FRAX and FPI, are part of the Frax ecosystem (pegged to the Consumer Price Index).

Bitcoin Long-Term Holder SOPR Has Dropped Below &apos;One&apos; Recently As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, BTC investors may be in for a frustrating few months if history is anything to go by. The &apos;spent output profit ratio&apos; (or SOPR in short) is an indicator that tells us whether Bitcoin investors are selling at a profit or at a loss right now. The metric works by going through the transaction history of each coin being sold on the chain, to see what price it was last moved at. If the previous selling price of any coin was less than the current value of BTC, then the coin has just been sold for a profit. On the other hand, the past value being more than the latest price of the crypto would imply the coin has moved at a loss. When the value of the SOPR is greater than one, it means the overall Bitcoin market is selling at a profit right now. Related Reading | Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap Approaches Zero, Selloff Ending?

Multiple news agencies stated that Uniswap had exceeded the Ethereum network in terms of transaction fees. The flagship DEX collected more than $4 million, surpassing the second-largest blockchain. UNI increased by roughly 45 percent in the last week, reaching $5.46, its highest level in more than three weeks.

42421528,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoYUH,1656255000,Opaque Platforms and Intertwined Protocols Pose Big Risk to Crypto,"We’re still firmly in Hard Times. Sure, my article last week about price and macro risk was published just before an eight-hour flurry when bitcoin gained 6.35%, but both hazards remain salient.  This article is the second in a three-part series about the risks facing cryptocurrency markets right now. Next week we'll look at public company risk.  This week we'll explore platform and protocol risk, which is one of my favorite topics in crypto because it’s the main area people try to get a “gotcha!” on me by conflating the latest failing in decentralized finance (DeFi) as a failing of Bitcoin. But this conflation, coupled with all the countless crypto hacks and failed blockchain projects, is exactly why we should pay attention to this risk vector.  Anyway, here goes two of three …  – George Kaloudis  What exactly platform and protocol risk means is straightforward. Protocol risk includes the risk associated with failures of the various crypto projects (i.e. protocols), like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Terra. Platform risk includes the risk associated with the failures of the institutions that have cropped up around crypto (i.e. platforms), like Coinbase (COIN), Three Arrows Capital (3AC) and Celsius Network (Celsius).  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.  But what has really made these two risks worth discussing in tandem is the fact that these protocols and platforms are intertwined.  Protocol risk is really technology risk  The collapse of Terra was just a month ago. Last week, Celsius Network, a company that offers high-yield products on crypto, paused withdrawals from its platform as it faces liquidity issues. Also last week, it was confirmed that prominent crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital is facing insolvency following poorly timed bets on Luna, GBTC and stETH.  When Terra collapsed, it dragged down the market meaningfully. Why it did was obvious (without hindsight) for two main reasons:  Terra was interoperable with other protocols, meaning it aimed to work in tandem with other crypto projects (such as the Cosmos IBC), and so when Terra went down, all the protocols it touched suffered collateral damage.  Terra held 80,000 bitcoins (BTC), which it liquidated in a failed attempt to protect the protocol, and a well-known entity selling 80,000 bitcoins in a short time frame put an immense amount of selling pressure on bitcoin’s price.  And that was just Terra. There has been a glut of DeFi scams, hacks and exploits plaguing crypto protocols with at least $5 billion of funds lost according to DEFIYIELD’s REKT database. Examples include Ronin for $625 million, Poly for $600 million and Wormhole for $326 million. Day by day, as the dizzying number of crypto protocols coming to life becomes more dizzying, the potential for one exploit to take down multiple protocols increases.  One piece of bad technology can take down entire swathes of capital. That, in and of itself, is a systemic risk.  Platform risk is really transparency risk  As of this writing, Celsius and 3AC still exist, but there’s no denying they are adding to the stress on the system.  For its part, Celsius offers retail customers yield in exchange for holding their coins. Its founder, Alex Mashinsky, has described Celsius as a platform that generates a certain amount of profit by lending assets, similar to banks.  Except.  Celsius has moved from providing short-term loans to market makers and arbitrage traders to deploying capital in DeFi’s lending protocols, which allow for higher-yielding strategies. Higher yield comes with higher risk. Higher risk than (and with fewer assurances than) any responsible bank would be comfortable with. There’s nothing wrong with offering yield, but there is something troubling about offering yield by way of putting customer assets at risk. And that increased risk profile has come to bear.  Following Celsius’ announcement that it was freezing withdrawals from the platform, my colleague Oliver Knight wrote a great article for CoinDesk about Celsius in which he quipped:  “If the collapse of [Terra] was cryptocurrency's Bear Stearns moment, Celsius Network threatens to become the industry's Lehman Brothers: the failure that exacerbates a market crisis.”  Meanwhile, 3AC, an actual leveraged crypto hedge fund, looks likely to fail after making some bad bets. This seems less bad than a Celsius insolvency, given 3AC’s customers and counterparties aren’t regular people. But it might get close to as bad for two reasons:  It shows that the mighty can fall, given most people in crypto considered 3AC to be an impressive firm run by “smart people.”  Hedge funds place many different bets with many different counterparties using many different techniques to use an undetermined amount of effective leverage to make More Money Than God.  The former wouldn’t be so bad if the latter didn’t mean that this failure by smart people meant that a lot of different entities (and eventually regular people) were affected. There is worry that 3AC’s failure will lead to a “contagion event” across all of crypto.  3AC placed enough margin bets so that its insolvency could set off cascading liquidations across trading desks, DeFi lending protocols and exchanges. In effect: Counterparty A will be forced to sell assets to avoid complete loss, pushing asset prices down, which leads to Counterparty B doing the same. And so on as asset values cascade down toward zero.  I submit that if Terra is Bear Stearns and Celsius is Lehman Brothers, maybe 3AC is Long-Term Capital Management.  In fairness, this isn’t necessarily a failure of the DeFi protocols because the leverage 3AC employed was generally between entities and on protocols. But therein lies the point. Platform risk is platform risk because of a lack of transparency.  Putting protocol and platform risk together  So if we put together the fact that crypto protocols are becoming more interdependent and that platforms are still operating opaquely, it is clear that we could be in for more pain if we protect the status quo. It is easy to imagine a world where we face another massive DeFi hack during a 3AC-like price-induced insolvency. It could be much worse.  In all, that’s a lot of doom and gloom for one newsletter, but I (as a bitcoiner) want to make something abundantly clear. The Bitcoin protocol is still working as designed. Bitcoin supporters like to say “tick tock, next block” in times of market stress; a dedication to the Bitcoin blockchain that continually operates, adding blocks to the chain no matter how many (or few) dollars you have to sell to buy 1 BTC (as long as someone is running mining equipment).  In a world where shoddy technology development and the lack of transparency by surrounding platforms can spell disaster, perhaps there is something to be said about keeping it simple.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/06/26/opaque-platforms-and-intertwined-protocols-pose-big-risk-to-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c0dde2906c3bcae0dd55ecfb6f6a03f31bb759d8-1440x958.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
