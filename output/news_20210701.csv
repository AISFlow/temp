42434737,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPssfh,1625171244,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Under Pressure Despite Improving Sentiment,"Bitcoin dipped below $34,000 on Thursday as selling pressure increased into July. However, traders expect buyers to remain active above $30,000 support as sentiment improves.      Positive news could limit downside moves after a volatile first half of the year. Concerns about regulatory crackdowns appear to have eased, especially as the bitcoin hashrate stabilized after falling for 10 straight days. The hashrate decline was mostly due to China’s shutdown of several cryptocurrency mining operations in the country.      “As miners spread to other locations, they will likely choose places with secure access to cheap energy sources,” wrote Ulrik Lykke, executive director at digital asset fund ARK36, in an email to CoinDesk. “As a result, hashrate will start recovering, and the network will become even more stable.”      Bitcoin is up about 13% year to date compared to a roughly 16% gain in the S&P 500.    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $33,238, -4.74%  Ether (ETH) $2,106.9, -6.47%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4317, +0.5%  Gold: $1,775.9, +0.31%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.461%, compared with 1.466% on Wednesday  Bearish sentiment wanes    Bitcoin’s put-call open interest ratio has slipped to a six-month low, indicating an ebbing of bearish sentiment.      According to data tracked by options analytics platform Skew, the ratio measuring the number of open positions, or open interest in put options relative to open interest in call options, fell to 0.60 on Wednesday, a level last seen in early January.      The recent decline in the put-call open interest ratio may have been fueled at least partly by a pickup in demand for calls or unwinding of long put positions, meaning an unwinding of bearish bets.      Another sign of improving sentiment is the recent positive uptick in bitcoin’s funding rate, which is the cost to fund long positions in the market for bitcoin perpetual swaps, a type of derivative in the cryptocurrency markets similar to futures contracts in traditional markets.      “Funding rates represent traders' sentiments of which position they bet on in the perpetual swaps market,” tweeted CryptoQuant on June 29. “Positive funding rates imply that many traders are bullish and long traders pay funding to short traders.”    Ether bounces back relative to bitcoin    Ether has outperformed bitcoin over the past few days and technical charts suggest further upside is ahead. The ETH/BTC ratio held support at the 100-day moving average as charts signaled oversold conditions and improving momentum. The ratio declined from resistance in May, which preceded the broader crypto sell-off.      The chart below shows the 90-day correlation between bitcoin and ether. The two cryptocurrencies are less correlated than a year ago despite a slight advance in co-movement over the past quarter.    Stablecoin risks    Analysts are looking into the rapid growth of stablecoins from a credit perspective.      Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer, which increased total assets of the dollar-linked stablecoin USDT to $62.8 billion on June 28, said it only holds 26.2% of its reserves in cash, fiduciary deposits, reverse repo notes and government securities, with 49.6% in commercial paper (CP), a type of short-term corporate debt.      “A sudden mass redemption of USDT could affect the stability of short-term credit markets if it occurred during a period of wider selling pressure in the CP market,” credit rating agency Fitch Ratings said in a report. “These figures suggest its CP holdings may be larger than those of most prime money market funds in the U.S.,” as well as in Europe, Middle East and Africa.      David Grider, lead digital asset strategist at the independent research firm Fundstrat, wrote in a separate report Thursday that pegged stablecoins “look a lot more like digital debt than digital dollars.”      “Tether is essentially a big credit fund with a pool of debt assets of their own that they say cover the value,” Grider wrote. “They say most of their assets are in money market commercial paper, which if true would be relatively low-risk assets.”    Altcoin roundup  DOGE drives Robinhood’s gain: Robinhood, the popular trading app for stock, options, gold and cryptocurrencies, filed for a public offering that could be worth up to $100 million. A big chunk of that growth – 34% of the firm’s crypto transaction revenue in the first quarter – was from DOGE (-1.26%), the memecoin that has surged in popularity this year.  Dogecoin’s fee change: A new fee structure for Dogecoin has been designed to reduce overall transaction fees as well as incentivize node operators to relay low-fee transactions to miners. The proposal, spearheaded by Dogecoin core developer Patrick Lodder and his team, would be implemented gradually over multiple software releases. Upon completion, the minimal relay fees from 1 DOGE would be changed to .001 DOGE.  USDC expands to Tron: Circle said Thursday the USDC stablecoin has been added to Justin Sun’s Tron network, which will expand the stablecoin’s availability to millions of users across Asia. The update comes after CoinDesk reported Tuesday that USDC’s CENTRE consortium was considering up to 10 more blockchains. The stablecoin is currently native to four blockchains – Ethereum, Algorand, Stellar and Solana.

42434710,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPss5h,1625170046,Stablecoins Risk a Rerun of Financial Crises Past,"After all the buzz around bitcoin becoming legal tender in El Salvador, June ended with another surprising twist in the money world. In a speech, Randal K. Quarles, none other than the vice chair for Supervision of the Federal Reserve System, praised “stablecoins” and cast doubt on central bank digital currencies (CBDC).      In contrast with the more cautious view advocated by another board member a month ago, Quarles hinted that, with improvements in the payments system and “properly structured stablecoins,” digital dollars may well be “superfluous.” Time to ditch CBDC plans and go all in on “stablecoins”?    Marcelo M. Prates, a CoinDesk columnist, is a central bank lawyer and researcher.    Hold your horses!      “Stablecoin” is nothing but a fancy name for one of two assets that have existed for decades: electronic money or shares in money market funds. And both can only be stable with government support, either through regulation and supervision or through bailouts (I’ll come back to this shortly). To paint “stablecoins” as a product of private ingenuity that is superior to a public option for digital money fails to consider the recent history of monetary and financial crises.      The basic idea behind stablecoins is simple: You find someone willing to receive your dull (although perfectly stable) dollars in exchange for something more exciting; an asset (the “coin”) that is issued digitally may work to make some payments, and can also earn you some interest in the meantime.      More than that, the receiver of your dollars (and issuer of the “stablecoin”) promises you that it stands ready to exchange the “stablecoins” back to dollars on a 1:1 basis anytime you want, no losses, hassle-free.      Sounds great, right? But there’s a catch.    Read more: Fed Vice Chair: ‘We Should Be Saying Yes’ to Stablecoins    The promise can only work if the stablecoin issuer properly manages the reserves, which are the dollars it received from all the people buying the stablecoins. Imagine that you pay me $100 for some coins I’ve just launched, say, 100 sambacoins. You can use the coins to stream newly released Brazilian music and, if you don’t spend them, I’ll exchange the sambacoins back to dollars at once.      What should I do with the $100 to avoid breaking the promise of exchanging the sambacoins back to dollars at any time? I could keep the $100 in cash at a safe place or deposited in a checking account, ready to be withdrawn when needed.      If the sambacoin is successful, and I start having more buyers, I could invest the dollars in short-term Treasurys, trusting that not all buyers will come to exchange the sambacoins back to dollars at the same time. Because Treasury bonds are typically stable in value and liquid, I could earn some (small) return and quickly sell the treasuries to meet payments when people wanted to sell me back their sambacoins. So far, so good.      What if I’m feeling bold and want to make higher returns from the sambacoin reserves? I could invest the reserve dollars in other crypto assets and use them on a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform to earn eye-popping gains. All good, unless I start having trouble to get out of these investments and convert them back into dollars, a situation that would leave my sambacoin reserves depleted.      At this point, I’ll not be able to buy back your 100 sambacoins for $100. Maybe I can give you $20 right away and, with luck, $20 more next week. That’s also the moment when you’ll probably start urging the government to step in and regulate stablecoin issuers – especially those using algorithms to keep the coin “stable.”    Read more: The Big Choices When Designing Central Bank Digital Currencies | Marcelo Prates    What are the lessons here? First, no money substitute can mimic the stability of cash – either dollar bills, as they exist today, or digital dollars, as they’ll exist in the future. Cash may not come with bells and whistles but, when issued by a credible central bank, its value is stable over time, meeting the need of those who prefer safety to profit. That’s why stablecoins can only be truly stable if they are 100% backed by – you got it! – cash.      Second, government’s support, in the form of regulation and supervision, is crucial for the success of privately issued stablecoins. Just look at the regulated stablecoins that already exist and have a prominent name outside the United States: electronic money.    Read more: Central Banks Had to Up Their Money Game This Year – And They Did | Marcelo Prates    As I said in a previous column, from the European Union to Brazil, e-money issuers work like narrow banks. They are legally required to keep the cash they receive from their clients safeguarded or insured so that e-money balances (kept in prepaid cards, for example) can always be converted back to cash with no loss of value. As they are licensed and supervised entities, customers know that, aside from gross regulatory failure, their e-money is safe.      In the United States, because no federal statute regulating e-money exists, stablecoin issuers are subject to state money transmitter laws and may end up regulated by 50 different regulators. The problem is that rules and regulations about segregation of clients’ funds and integrity of assets kept in reserve aren’t uniform or consistently enforced.      In practice, stablecoin issuers in the United States are taking advantage of the regulatory morass to escape accountability. Stablecoin holders have to blindly trust the issuer or try to find and examine its financial disclosures by themselves. Recent examples of disclosures made by stablecoin issuers have been concerning at best and disturbing at worst.      Third, private promises of stable money that go unchecked end badly – and often require the use of taxpayer money to clean up the mess. The history of money market funds in the United States is illustrative.      These funds were created in the 1970s to work around interest-rate ceilings on demand deposits that were imposed by the infamous “Regulation Q.” Balances in money market funds were believed to be as safe as insured deposits but with the advantage of earning a higher interest, which was especially enticing when inflation and interest rates were rising.      The assumption was that with good management, shares in these funds would always maintain a stable value of $1 per share. What seemed to be a brilliant idea ended up fueling the shadow banking system and leading to the 2007-2008 global financial crisis. To avoid even greater instability, the Federal Reserve had to backstop money market funds through the crisis and again during the coronavirus pandemic. The lessons are thus clear: Well-managed and properly regulated stablecoins may be useful for certain purposes and players, like those operating in the DeFi world. But stablecoins will never be as stable as dollars, physical or digital – and may even require a bailout when panic over broken promises spreads.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Marcelo M.

42434732,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPssdh,1625166549,India May Have Quietly Shown Its Hand on Crypto Regulation,"June was a dramatic month for cryptocurrency – not only in terms of price fluctuations but also regulations. While we saw good tidings like the declaration of bitcoin as a legal tender in El Salvador, regulatory crackdowns in countries like China have turned the market bearish. More quietly, in India a seismic regulatory development has passed by relatively unnoticed.      The past few months have seen some positive regulatory moves by the government here. In March, the Finance Minister denied the possibility of a blanket ban “shutting off all options” and outlined the government’s plans to take a “calibrated"" approach towards cryptocurrencies in the country. She went on to emphasize the need for experimentation in blockchain and cryptocurrency.    Tanvi Ratna, a CoinDesk columnist, is the founder and CEO of Policy 4.0, a research and advisory body working on new policy approaches for digital assets.    Later, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) declared it mandatory for companies to declare their crypto investments during the financial year – considered by some as a step towards regulations, even hinting towards the possibility of upcoming tax regulations. All these developments have led to a major boom in the Indian crypto industry. A recent Chainalysis report indicated that crypto investments in India this quarter have gone up 612% from $923 million in April 2020 to nearly $6.6 billion in May 2021.      On the other hand, Indian crypto exchanges saw their banking access being restricted. The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) governor clarified on the record that there was no change in the RBI’s stance on cryptocurrency. Right after that, the Enforcement Directorate (ED), India’s financial crime investigator, issued a show-cause notice to WazirX – India’s biggest crypto exchange – for facilitating money laundering. This also comes at the same time as global regulatory action on Binance, Wazir-X’s parent company. Binance companies have had to cease operations in Ontario and now in the U.K. due to regulatory pressures.      WazirX has been charged with allegedly infringing the Indian Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) on cryptocurrency transactions worth Rs 2,790.74 crore, roughly $374 million. According to the ED, around INR 57 crores (approximately $7.6 million) was laundered by a Chinese-owned illegal online betting app by converting rupee deposits into the tether stablecoin and then transferring the funds to Binance wallets based on instructions received from abroad. The ED also accused WazirX of violating basic know your customer/anti-money laundering (KYC/AML) rules for foreign transactions.    Read more: Indian Investments in Crypto Have Exploded: Report    The case could have ramifications for the treatment of cryptocurrency under Indian law. This is significant because the Indian government, outside of the 2019 ""Report on Virtual Currencies"" that saw no place for cryptocurrencies in India, has not made any statement on how it views the nature of virtual currencies. Apart from an unverified news report that cryptocurrency might be viewed as an asset (which was superseded by this verdict), there has been no indication of whether the government views these assets as currency, commodity or in other terms. However, two important public documents now equate crypto to currency in functionality.      The recent ED notice contains a single apparently innocuous sentence which has been missed by most observers. The ED investigation concluded that crypto is in fact “akin to money” or currency under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA).      This builds upon a second public sector document that revealed similar conclusions: the Indian Supreme Court verdict on cryptocurrency that came out in March 2020. This was a part of other major red flags that I had analyzed in this video the day after the verdict. The Supreme Court came to a similar assessment that cryptocurrency could very well function as money even if the law did not recognize it that way.      The Supreme Court verdict at several points also reiterates this conclusion that cryptocurrencies are quite capable of functioning as money, despite what is decided on their legal tender status.      Although the RBI has made no comment with regard to the nature of cryptocurrencies, in its 2018 circular it did cite the potential of virtual currencies to create a parallel system of payment that albeit does not fit the criteria of a payment system.    Read more: India’s Developers Are Web 3’s Sleeping Giant | Tanvi Ratna    If cryptocurrency is “akin to currency,” that will have several implications for the industry in India. Any money-like instrument is firmly under the supervision of the Reserve Bank of India, which has held a consistent stance on cryptocurrency since 2013. The flow and transfer of money is highly regulated in India, both within the financial system as well as across borders, opening up multiple regulatory considerations for industry players. There could also be implications for the treatment of NFTs, DeFi and other breakthroughs in the sector. This is one development to track closely.

The seven-day moving average of bitcoin active addresses – ones active on the network as sender or receiver – fell to 758,165 on Wednesday, the lowest since April 2020, per data provided by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.  ""The decline in active user participation is a sign of weak demand,"" Charlie Morris, chief investment officer at ByteTree Asset Management, said. ""The hype cycle is over for now, and the market is unable to attract new entrants at the same pace.""  The seven-day average of the daily transaction count tracked by Glassnode has also dipped below 300,000 for the first time since March 2020.  Network usage affects the demand for cryptocurrency and can influence its price.  ""When there's greater usage, there's more demand for the cryptocurrency, and that drives the price up,"" Philip Gradwell, chief economist at the blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis, told CoinDesk last year.  The count of bitcoin active addresses led the cryptocurrency higher in the final quarter of 2020.

Along with the company's financials, the SEC document shows the reach of Robinhood as a popular destination for crypto trading.      ""For the three months ended March 31, 2021, 17% of our total revenue was derived from transaction-based revenues earned from cryptocurrency transactions, compared to 4% for the three months year ended December 31, 2020,"" the firm wrote.      A big chunk of that growth – 34% of the firm's crypto transaction revenue in the first quarter – was from DOGE, the memecoin that has surged in popularity this year.      ""If demand for transactions in dogecoin declines and is not replaced by new demand for other cryptocurrencies available for trading on our platform, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected,"" Robinhood said.      The app currently has seven cryptocurrencies available for trading.      Robinhood has been criticized by regulators who have said the app encourages the game-like nature of trading, particularly among inexperienced retail traders. On Wednesday, the firm was fined approximately $70 million by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), which said Robinhood had provided false or misleading information to users and failed to report many customer complaints about its services.      The underwriters for the IPO include Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Citigroup.      Robinhood's IPO differs from Coinbase, the crypto exchange that opted to issue shares via a direct public offering, which eliminates intermediaries and only sells shares that already exist. Coinbase's valuation based on its first-day trading price of April 14 was about $99 billion using a fully diluted share count of 261.3 million.

That was a central premise of a congressional hearing yesterday devoted to the risks crypto presents for retail and institutional investors. The hearing was provocatively titled: “America on ‘FIRE’: Will the Crypto Frenzy Lead to Financial Independence and Early Retirement or Financial Ruin?”  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  ""Today's hearing will ... assess the systemic risks to the economy, as well as the risk of loss to individual investors caused by recent periods of extreme volatility in crypto assets that are not backed by any form of tangible collateral,"" Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) said, kicking off the event.  The hearing took place at a moment when U.S. lawmakers seem to be cranking up the heat on the crypto industry. A host of government officials and agencies have stated the importance of rethinking the nation’s crypto strategy.  CoinDesk Managing Editor Nik De said yesterday’s meeting on Capitol Hill seemed to be more of a fact-finding mission for Congress than a witch hunt. (He live-tweeted the event if you want a full rundown.)  Finding facts could be a difficult task in crypto. Despite the fact the industry is (mostly) built on fully transparent and audible ledgers, there’s a remarkable amount that’s unknown. For instance, exactly how big is this industry? How many cryptocurrencies are there?  “At the outset it is worth noting that there is no official public data source for cryptocurrency prices, market size or volatility. This lack of data is a significant problem,” Sarah Hammer, managing director of the Stevens Center for Innovation and Finance at the Wharton School at UPenn, testified.  “Financial regulators are at a distinct disadvantage in evaluating their regulatory options,” she added later, conceding a general lack of knowledge.  Hammer brings up a significant point: Before regulators can get clear about the risks to consumers or the economy as a whole, they need to get a better grasp on crypto. She noted that before the 2007-2008 financial crisis, there were no official data sources for credit default swaps (the derivatives product that blew a whole in the world’s biggest banks) or clarity on how to regulate them.  Of course, there are a number of independent and trustworthy data sources in crypto. But sometimes even getting a clear answer on what bitcoin’s price is could be daunting – fractured markets mean there is no unified price, only various estimates using different measures.  Read more: Does Crypto Need Circuit Breakers? Last Week’s Price Crash Ignites a Debate  A similar question came up this week when a judge dismissed the U.S. government’s case against Facebook for monopolistic practices. U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg wrote in an opinion: The Federal Trade Commission’s “inability to offer any indication of the metric(s) or method(s) it used to calculate Facebook’s market share” makes its argument “too speculative and conclusory to go forward.”  Boasberg gave the government 30 days to come up with a metric that measures how big the social media economy is and how much attention share Facebook has captured. It’ll be a difficult task.  Of course, the government isn’t pursuing legal action against “crypto,” but it is trying to answer a similar question about size.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/07/01/before-we-regulate-crypto-we-need-to-know-what-crypto-is,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eeb4ce97ca2f4b7a47929e387e31a51f02a63961-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Calaxy, a mashup of “Creator’s Galaxy,” allows creators and celebrities to raise money with tokens and allow fans to interact with them through video messages, online classes, video calls and fan club subscriptions. The raise was completed through a simple agreement for future tokens (SAFT) that could be redeemed either for Calaxy’s native token, CLXY, or for equity in Calaxy.      “The most exciting thing about the next step is getting this in fans hands and being able to accept feedback,” Dinwiddie, who plays guard for the Brooklyn Nets, said in an interview with CoinDesk.      So far, the app has only been tested internally but will go into public beta in a few weeks, said Solo Ceesay, Calaxy COO and co-founder.      “What that means is we're going to have a Clubhouse-style rollout, where we invite influencers along with their communities, and one-by-one try to drive some FOMO to the platform,” Ceesay said.      The funding will be used to build out Calaxy’s infrastructure but also to add features like the ability for creators to tokenize their contracts, like Dinwiddie attempted to do in 2020.    Read more: Spencer Dinwiddie: Why NBA Players Are Warming to Crypto    The round was raised by Animoca Brands, Red Beard Ventures, ArkStream Capital, NGC Ventures and Genesis Block Ventures. National Football League star Ezekiel Elliott, Matt James from “The Bachelor,” National Basketball Association coach Luke Walton, former head of blockchain strategy at PayPal Jonathan Padilla and NFL player Larry Ogunjobi also joined in.      The raise also includes a list of initial creators who will participate in public beta: Elliott, James, singer-songwriter Teyana Taylor, NBA player (and Taylor’s husband) Iman Shumpert, “WAGS Miami” star Claudia Sampedro and social media influencers Eric Struk, Chaz Smith and Chozus.      Several of the creators and investors are new to crypto, Ceesay said.      “Calaxy is the first palatable crypto investment for these people,” Ceesay said, adding:    “This opens the gateways to new technology and allows them to adopt it and use it in a way in which it makes sense to them – similar to NFTs and NBA Top Shot.”    Calaxy runs on Hedera Hashgraph and uses the Hedera Token Service. The hashgraph is a blockchain-like distributed ledger and boasts a high transaction throughput, which is why Calaxy chose to use Hedera’s DLT versus Ethereum, Dinwiddie said.

42434709,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPss7h,1625146790,Fitch Says Rapid Stablecoin Growth Poses 'Contagion Risks',"The rapid growth of stablecoin issuance could have implications for the functioning of short-term credit markets, the bond-rating service Fitch said Thursday.      Stablecoins, typically digital tokens linked to government-issued currencies such as the U.S. dollar, could pose “contagion risks” over time, the ratings service said in a press release.      Fitch noted that Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer, had increased total assets of the dollar-linked stablecoin USDT to $62.8 billion on June 28. According to the release, Tether had announced it held only 26.2% of its reserves in cash, fiduciary deposits, reverse repo notes and government securities, with a 49.6% in commercial paper (CP), a type of short-term corporate debt.      Tether’s CP holdings amounted to $20.3 billion on March 31, according to Fitch.    Read more: Stablecoins and CBDCs: Private Vs. Public Monetary Innovation    Some traders, analysts and economists have speculated that financial losses at Tether or even a crisis of confidence might trigger a sell-off that could put downward pressure on prices for other cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin.      The Fitch report suggests the turmoil also could also have implications for traditional markets.      “A sudden mass redemption of USDT could affect the stability of short-term credit markets if it occurred during a period of wider selling pressure in the CP market,” said the report. “These figures suggest its CP holdings may be larger than those of most prime money market funds in the U.S.,” as well as in Europe, Middle East and Africa.      Potential asset contagion risks linked to the liquidation of stablecoin reserve holdings “could increase pressure for tighter regulation of the nascent sector,” according to Fitch.      The report defines contagion risks to be primarily associated with “collateralized stablecoins, varying based on the size, liquidity and riskiness of their asset holdings,” among other things.    Read more: SoftBank Invests $200M in Brazil Crypto Exchange Mercado Bitcoin    There’s less risk associated with coins that are fully backed by “safe, highly liquid assets,” according to the rating service. Stablecoins that use fractional reserves may run a greater risk.    'Digital debt'    David Grider, lead digital asset strategist at the independent research firm Fundstrat, wrote separately in a report Thursday that stablecoins are ""becoming a big part of the crypto economy with the total value of stablecoins outstanding now at ~$108 billion.""      He said it's important to note that ""these assets look a lot more like digital debt than digital dollars,"" since they're really just a promise that the money will be paid back the money when the instruments are redeemed.      ""The main risk to users is that the issuer does not have the collateral to meet redemptions when requested by the stablecoin holder,"" Grider wrote.      He gets frequent questions about Tether, he wrote, since ""many in the crypto community have been concerned for years that the value of Tether is not backed by sufficient dollars to cover the outstanding USDT tokens.""      ""Tether is essentially a big credit fund with a pool of debt assets of their own that they say cover the value,"" Grider wrote. ""They say most of their assets are in money market commercial paper, which if true would be relatively low-risk assets.""      He conjectured that his ""gut"" is that New York State investigators would have discovered if Tether was ""lying"" about its assets during a recent probe.      “While we don’t know for certain the details about Tether’s reserves, we’re not as concerned about the stablecoin as many others are,” according to the analyst.      “One thing is certain, crypto lenders have been willing to give Tether $60 billion of the best type of financing, with the lowest cost of capital and most unrestrictive covenant-lite borrowing terms, anyone could ever ask for,"" Grider wrote.",NEGATIVE,USDT,EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | SPONSORED | USDT,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/01/fitch-says-rapid-stablecoin-growth-poses-contagion-risks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d09efe0e90f267d5970bee07f55865dd7be3993d-1300x945.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434715,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPssHh,1625146095,"Dogecoin's Fee Change Promises to Reduce Costs and Incentivize Nodes, Miners","A new fee structure for Dogecoin has been designed to reduce overall transaction fees as well as incentivize node operators to relay low-fee transactions to miners.      Announced Sunday, the proposal, spearheaded by Dogecoin core developer Patrick Lodder and his team, would be implemented gradually over multiple software releases.      Introduced in 2014 and implemented in 2018, the current “meaningful fee” model was intended to prevent on-chain transaction spamming. These fees charge 1 DOGE per kilobyte of transaction data, which translates to about 2.16 DOGE (US$0.24) per average transaction.    Read more: Dogecoin’s Surging Price Has Resurrected Its Technical Development    With this year’s spike in price for dogecoin, meaningful fees can be costly. Currently, users are keeping their dogecoins on centralized platforms because transferring funds to self-hosted wallets is expensive. On the other hand, transactions with relay fees under 1 DOGE do not provide enough incentive to reach miners and are often left unconfirmed.      Many of the changes proposed cater to a freer system in which miners and nodes drive rates.    Change minimal relay fees from 1 DOGE to .001 DOGE. At launch, node operators on the Dogecoin network will be able to set custom relay fees.  Reduce the dust limit to .01 DOGE to incentivize the use of microtransactions. In cryptocurrency, dust refers to a fraction of a token so small, it is practically negligible. Under the current model the dust limit is too high. What last year may have been considered dust in terms of U.S. dollars is now considerably more valuable due to the spike in the price of dogecoin this year. By decreasing the dust limit, transactions between .01 DOGE and 1 DOGE can be considered full transactions and hence be relayed and accepted by miners. Node operators will be able to control this dust limit using the new “-dustLimit” parameter.  Define a default block inclusion fee rate at .01 DOGE, up from the current fee of .00001 DOGE. This fee will incentivize miners to confirm a transaction on the soonest block available while disincentivizing spam transactions.  Enhance relay logic to allow more transactions into the “freespace,” an apportioned section of a block where transactions with little or no relay fee can be mined free of any block inclusion fee. Due to high relay fees on small transactions, the freespace has mostly gone unused. However, transactions from the mempool will no longer be prioritized solely on transaction size.  In a second software release, the recommended minimum fee rate will be decreased to .01 DOGE once 30% of the network begins relaying transactions with .01 DOGE/kb.    “The purpose of Dogecoin transaction fees is spam prevention,” said Dogecoin developer Ross Nicoll. “We provide suggested values so users can have confidence. If they use those values, their transactions will confirm in a reasonable time.”      He noted that while there are minimum default fees in the proposal, “of course anyone can modify their nodes to use alternative values.”      Elon Musk, followed by countless others across Twitter, r/dogecoindev, and the Dogecoin Github, have already shown their support, though there are still some questions.      Udi Wertheimer, for example, responded to the proposal on Github, suggesting the development team “should encourage a more robust and dynamic free market, which should have the effect of reducing fees based on current market conditions.”      Also, Wertheimer, a developer, noted the uncertainty concerning free transaction relay and its ability to “open the door for cheap distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on nodes,” to which Lodder responded with “Good point.”",POSITIVE,DOGE,DOGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Myles Sherman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/07/01/dogecoins-fee-change-promises-to-reduce-costs-and-incentivize-nodes-miners,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fe7170a00b52c41524f69c0fdeae1f78705c0935-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The platform, which allows users to organize video game tournaments on either the Ethereum mainnet, Binance Smart Chain or Polygon, has raised $2.3 million in a seed funding round led by CoinFund.      Prominent backers such as Dapper Labs, Multicoin Capital, Rally founder Kevin Chou, Signum Growth Capital, Kevin Durant and Rich Kleiman's Thirty Five Ventures and non-fungible token (NFT) collector WhaleShark also invested.      The capital injection follows an earlier pre-seed investment by ConsenSys and will be used to hire additional staff and grow the platform’s presence across Latin America and Southeast Asia, according to Community Gaming CEO Chris Gonsalves.      Community Gaming’s blockchain-based platform enables rewards to be paid out instantaneously in the ERC-20 token of the organizer’s choice, and sent directly to users’ crypto wallets.      Is the latest example of the worlds of blockchain and video games colliding. NFTs have emerged as a popular way to buy digital collectibles; investors are betting on games as the next venue for crypto’s mainstream embrace.    Gaming gateway    Much like Dapper Labs’ NBA Top Shot, Community Gaming’s platform is designed to be user-friendly even for people with no prior crypto experience.

An open-mindedness, a little bit more risk or adventure seeking, and generally an openness to the idea of self-sovereignty.”    According to Gonsalves, the platform’s number of active users is growing quickly, doubling to 20,000 in June alone.      Gonsalves also said the platform, which until now has been making the majority of its revenue through sponsorships with companies like Facebook Gaming, MakerDAO and Theta.tv, plans to begin charging a 5% commission on all tournaments.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | BNB,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/07/01/coinfund-leads-23m-investment-in-esports-startup-trying-to-bring-crypto-to-gamers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/20b0cc79cb51d31e1033cad212ce9525feba3d8b-1500x988.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406752,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8Elf,1625142092,Has the Biden Administration Lost the Plot on Crypto Regulation?,"While we understand the Biden Administration’s approach to crypto regulation is in the process of being defined, we have yet to see any definitive proposals or policy statements that will bring clarity and consistency.      What we have glimpsed through statements by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, and from recent congressional hearings, appears defensive and reactionary. It also appears to be influenced more by recent ransomware attacks, China’s policy regarding central bank digital currencies (CBDC), environmental issues and El Salvador's adoption of bitcoin as legal tender than any effort to clarify markets and assist the industry's growth. It appears agencies that are responsible for crypto regulation have shifted to national security concerns instead of competitive markets and products. The lack of progress is disappointing.    Olta Andoni is chief legal officer at Nifty’s. Donna Redel is a professor at Fordham Law and board member at New York Angels.    This state of affairs contrasts starkly to the increasing institutional adoption of crypto currency assets, the approval of exchange-traded funds (ETF) by Canada, Brazil and states in Europe and the movement among states here (especially Wyoming, Texas and New York) to create comprehensive legal frameworks for crypto-digital assets and the widespread crypto ownership by the public.      Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler advocated during his recent U.S. Senate testimony about the creation of a multi-agency task force approach, which requires authorization by Congress. A transparent collaboration with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Department of Treasury and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency would be laudable, but will take considerable time and thus will not add clarity anytime soon. That the SEC’s published 2021 agenda does not include crypto digital assets, to the disappointment of many including Commissioners Hester Peirce and Elad Roisman (as noted in their joint statement), means enforcement will continue to be favored over regulation.      Furthermore, recent enforcement actions/settlements around the 2017 initial coin offerings are not instructive in the current environment where decentralized finance (DeFi) projects with VC backing operate without apparent regulatory oversight. A recent plenary meeting of selected DeFi projects and regulators happened behind closed doors, giving the public and other projects little guidance. The action brought against Ripple and other associated entities is only in the discovery stage, so it is doubtful that any outcome will occur in 2021 that might provide greater legal clarity. There are no cases likely to lead to judge-made law suggesting when a token is or is not a security, still the number one issue of regulatory confusion among several of them.    Read more: Treasury Nominees Pledge to Enforce New Crypto Regulations    Chairman Gensler recently stated “...This (crypto) is quite volatile, one might say a highly volatile asset class, and the investing public would benefit from investor protection on crypto exchanges.” The emphasis on a federal framework for exchange regulation is, in our opinion, long overdue as we advocated in our CoinDesk article in response to Peirce’s Safe Harbor Proposal 1.0. But more certainty is needed, whether that certainty is the result of judge-made law, a binding rule promulgated by the SEC or a new law created by Congress.      The beginning of the Gensler tenure doesn’t bode well for the crypto market, which is still seeking clarity on existing products, much less an ETF product with as many as nine proposals before the SEC for consideration. ETFs are popular with retail investors who currently have little or no access to regulated bitcoin products, thereby “forcing” them into more risky unregulated altcoin alternatives.      The recent CBDC hearings on Capitol Hill, most notably that of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s subcommittee and the committee of Rep. Maxine Walter of California, both Democrats, have demonstrated a dual-pronged approach to protect the dollar’s hegemony. The committees proposed task forces to study a digital dollar and restrictive crypto regulation aligned with national security and crime concerns. In our opinion, this is the wrong approach because it is based on the lack of understanding of the environmental impact of bitcoin, and underplays the need to move quicker on the adoption of CBDCs to be globally competitive while simultaneously protecting citizen privacy. At the same time, a U.S. dollar CBDC might reduce reliance on stablecoins like tether, which were recently labeled by a federal official as a short-term financial destabilizer.      Yellen and Powell have highlighted concerns with crypto regarding know-your customer/anti-money laundering (KYC/AML) rules, the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and terrorist crimes as major concerns. They have even cited national security in their comments about crypto. Most U.S.-facing regulated exchanges are basically compliant with Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) “Travel Rule” (a requirement that targets the anonymity of wire and crypto transactions to address money laundering) but global DeFi exchanges and protocols are not compliant. FATF’s latest proposal includes extending certain requirements to DeFi, but implementing the final version was recently postponed to October 2021.      Michael Hsu, OCC’s acting comptroller, is reconsidering previous guidance by former Comptroller Brian Brooks (who is now running Binance.US). Hsu has requested a review of all the federal bank regulator’s pending matters, interpretative letters and guidance, including issues around digital assets and cryptocurrencies. The OCC move is another step backwards for the U.S. in global innovation and leadership for digital assets.      Technology and regulations usually are not fully synced, but it is about time for the U.S. to step forward and build a competitive crypto-focused regulatory approach across many agencies, thereby allowing for industry to operate with clarity and consistency. It does not appear, at the moment, that the Biden administration shares this important goal.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,"Donna Redel, Olta Andoni",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/07/01/has-the-biden-administration-lost-the-plot-on-crypto-regulation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/620615914e5238502efd652b057083ad61e30556-1400x944.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406748,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8Efl,1625138950,Bitcoin's Sliding Put-Call Ratio Points to Weakening Bearish Sentiment: Analysts,"Bitcoin's put-call open interest ratio has slipped to six-month lows, indicating an ebbing of bearish sentiment.      According to data tracked by options analytics platform Skew, the ratio measuring the number of open positions, or open interest in put options relative to open interest in call options, fell to 0.60 on Wednesday, a level last seen in early January.      ""The ratio has come down, indicating growing demand for call options, which could be interpreted as a positive signal, demonstrating a potential decline in overall bearish sentiment,"" Luuk Strijers, chief commercial officer at Deribit, the world's largest crypto-options exchange by open interest and trading volume, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.      Call options give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market. A put option gives the right to sell and represents a bearish bet.      The put-call open interest ratio peaked at 0.94 in April and has been falling ever since.      ""We perceive the overall slide in the ratio as a bullish indicator,"" Nick Mancini, a research analyst at Trade the Chain, said. ""If the number of puts open relative to calls is decreasing, traders are taking less bearish outlook and are prepping for bullish price action.""      The ratio slipped to a then six-month low of 0.45 in late December and remained mainly in the range of 0.50 to 0.70 in January as flows were concentrated on the call side. Bitcoin topped the long-held $20,000 resistance in December and rallied by 100% to nearly $60,000 in the first quarter of this year.      ""When the market was bullish in January, we could see a lot of flows buying calls at strikes 50% above bitcoin's going market price,"" Martin Cheung, an options trader from Pulsar Trading Capital, said in a Telegram chat.      Cheung said the ratio's slide from highs seen in April and May indicates the market has calmed down and digested most of the negative news flow.      That said, drawing conclusions from the put-call open interest ratio can be problematic, because the measure does not reveal whether the number of positions open is mainly on the bullish or bearish side.      For example, some market participants may have sold call options in recent weeks, adding to the tally of the number of open positions in calls – the ratio's denominator – and contributing to the downward pressure on the ratio. Savvy traders often sell call options, that is insurance against a bullish move, when they expect the market to consolidate or drop.      ""You have to bear in mind that the put-call open interest ratio can give the wrong message,"" Deribit's Strijers said. ""For example, users shorting upside calls contribute to open interest and volumes for calls; however, that is a bearish strategy.""      Nevertheless, the recent decline in the put-call open interest ratio may have been fueled at least partly by a pickup in demand for calls or unwinding of long put positions, that is unwinding of bearish bets.      Bitcoin is currently trading at $33,230, a 5% drop on the day. While the put-call ratio is giving bullish hints, the options smile shows persistent concern of an extended sell-off and greater demand for puts or bearish bets at strikes lower than bitcoin's current market price.

The investment signifies the largest B round in Latin America's history and SoftBank's largest investment in a Latin America crypto company, said Roberto Dagnoni, CEO and executive chairman of 2TM Group, Mercado Bitcoin's parent company.      The investment round grants 2TM Group a $2.1 billion valuation, Dagnoni told CoinDesk.      2TM Group is the second Latin American crypto unicorn, after Bitso announced a $250 million Series C in May with a $2.2 billion valuation.      Following the investment, the company plans to expand in Latin America, Dagnoni said, saying he contemplates branches in Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Mexico. The expansion will take place either organically or through acquisitions, he said.      The company has already been in talks with peers about potential acquisitions, the CEO said.      “We’ve been impressed by 2TM Group’s understanding of the Brazilian ecosystem, as well as their contribution to the evolving regulatory framework in Brazil, all of which have positioned it at the forefront of the Latin American blockchain revolution and as a defining player in the cryptocurrency explosion in Brazil,” said Marcelo Claure, CEO of SoftBank Group International and COO of SoftBank Group in a press release.      The company's press release said it signed about 700,000 new users up between January and May 2021 and now has a client base of 2.8 million overall. Mercado Bitcoin's trade volume also increased to $5 billion, surpassing the total for its first seven years combined.

Germany's Fund Location Act, introduced in April and approved by parliament shortly thereafter, permits ""Spezialfonds,"" or special funds, to invest as much as 20% of their portfolios in crypto.  The law came into effect today.  Should every Spezialfond choose to allocate the full 20% in crypto, that would equate to €350 billion ($415 billion), based on the total assets under management of such funds in Germany.  The figure was arrived at by Sven Hildebrandt, CEO of Distributed Ledger Consulting, and was cited in a report by financial newspaper Boersen Zeitung in April.

42406750,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8Ejh,1625124255,BaFin-Licensed DeFi Firm Swarm Starts Onboarding $15M of Pledged Liquidity,"Buttoned-up decentralized finance (DeFi) is becoming a thing.      Swarm Markets, which claims to be the world’s first regulated DeFi protocol, said Thursday it is onboarding signees to its liquidity provider program. The firm is licensed by German financial regulator BaFin.      The Berlin-based trading platform has managed to shoehorn DeFi into existing regulatory infrastructure and has some $15 million pledged from over 250 customers, the firm said.      Traditional finance firms are dipping their toes into DeFi pools but are unsure of trading with unknown counterparties and pseudonymous liquidity. Swarm meets regulatory know-your-customer (KYC) requirements while remaining private, the company said.      When it comes to cryptocurrency regulation, Germany’s position is clearer than most, with a provision to allow regulated firms, including banks, to be custodians of crypto. Indeed, Swarm co-founders, Philipp Pieper and Timo Lehes, moved from the U.S. to Germany to set up shop for this reason.    Read more: Coinbase Receives Crypto Custody License From German Regulator BaFin    Swarm was engaged in ""very constructive dialogue"" with BaFin as part of an application made in early 2020, Pieper said.      “It became evident that DeFi was not just a gimmicky play for crypto insiders, and there was real novelty in shared liquidity and protocol-based lending,” Pieper said. “It gained more credibility with institutions by the month, and regulators also saw it as a winning proposition.”      Having identification of wallet holders baked in is necessary if you want to capture a lot of capital sitting on the sidelines of DeFi, said Lehes, but it’s also important to know about the ownership of the platform too.      “There’s really two problems to solve there,” Lehes said. “One is that you don't know who you're dealing with on the other side, which means potentially a risk of some kind of money-laundering situation that you don't want to be in. The other part is you’re susceptible to a rug pull if you’re not dealing with a counterparty that’s identified and preferably licenced.”      Swarm says it’s starting off conservatively with a few asset pools covering major tokens like BTC, ETH and DAI, and promising yields in the “high single digits to early teens,” with rewards depending on the activity and volumes in each pool.      “We are not aiming to do something that’s a short-term boost with a fantasy return number,” said Lehes. “We’re aiming to build products and pools that have a longevity to them, and providing a return is actually sustainable over a longer period of time.”",POSITIVE,BTC | DAI,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | TRADING | DAI,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/07/01/bafin-licensed-defi-firm-swarm-starts-onboarding-15m-of-pledged-liquidity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f18b575b54e728ada3e1bc83e489c6bed2e094d5-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406734,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8EYs,1625102832,SBI Holdings Touts XRP Ledger for NFT Use in the Tokenization of a 'Variety of Assets',"Japan-based financial-services company SBI Holdings thinks non-fungible tokens (NFTs) could be a good opportunity for the XRP Ledger (XRPL).      According to a report on Tuesday titled ""Current Management Information Briefing,"" SBI outlined reasons why it believes XRP could be a sound choice for the use of NFTs.      Under the section, ""Building a More Sustainable, Scalable, and Accessible Future for NFTs with XRPL"" in the report, the company said XRP has ""extremely low transaction fees."" SBI also said the crypto can be ""settled instantly"" without much of an impact on the environment because it doesn't rely on mining, making it an attractive choice.      NFTs are digital assets that can be created as unique contracts on a blockchain and generally represent a physical real-world good. They contain distinguishing bits of information that make them both unique from any other NFT and easily verifiable.      See also: What Are NFTs and How Do They Work?      ""The blockchain XRP Ledger has the ability to tokenize not only XRP but also a variety of other assets,"" the company said in its report.      SBI's belief in XRP as a token extends beyond its potential use in NFTs. In May, SBI Ripple Asia, a joint venture between SBI Holdings and Ripple, introduced Cambodia’s first international remittance service using blockchain technology.      In March, SBI said shareholders who own at least 100 shares will be eligible to receive XRP worth 2,500 yen ($22.50) as a way of thanking them for their support.      In its report, the company also touched on NFTs as a use case in the art world, highlighting Beeple's $69 million record-breaking sale in March.      ""A blockchain certificate will ensure the authenticity of artworks as more reliable through a tamper-resistant and highly transparent blockchain mechanism,"" the company said.      Still, the focus, according to the company, remains on the tokenization aspect, citing figures from the World Economic Forum that predict 10% of the world's gross domestic product would be tokenized by 2027.      ""Achieving impact at-scale across so many asset types will require the interaction of different blockchains and existing internet and financial infrastructures,"" SBI said.
