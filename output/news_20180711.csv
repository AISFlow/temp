42380975,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX938v7,1531348543,Federal Judge Wavers as CFTC Seeks Injunction in Crypto Fraud Case,"The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is wrapping up its case against CabbageTech owner and accused crypto-fraudster Patrick McDonnell – but the hearings in New York this week have been anything but simple.  The U.S. regulator is seeking a permanent injunction against McDonnell, who allegedly defrauded investors out of nearly $500,000, according to a lawsuit the CFTC filed in January.  The case has already seen notable developments on the regulatory front, including a ruling from March that backed the agency's argument that cryptocurrencies are a form of commodity.  While a ruling on the permanent injunction was anticipated on Wednesday in New York, U.S. District Judge Jack Weinstein for the Eastern District of New York pushed closing arguments to Thursday – largely due to the continued absence of McDonnell, who appeared in court Monday but did not on either subsequent day.  Indeed, Weinstein expressed concern about the case's conclusion, stating that the proceedings were ""in effect...a criminal case"" at multiple points during the first three days.  At the heart of the issue is the burden of proof. Civil suits must be proven by a ""preponderance of evidence"" but not ""beyond a reasonable doubt."" A preponderance is a lighter burden of proof than would be seen in a criminal case, he noted.  Weinstein further noted that McDonnell could object to the case against him based on the burden of proof. He also added that because McDonnell is defending himself, he might be forced to give up his Fifth Amendment rights during testimony.  As Weinstein explained on Wednesday:  ""I continue to be concerned about a very basic [issue] ... the right of the defendant to have a jury. He's faced with the Fifth Amendment problem because [he is representing himself]. It is disturbing that a crime - and it is a crime, what's been [discussed] - is proved by a preponderance [of evidence] and not a reasonable doubt.""  Defendant absence  McDonnell hasn't been present since he lost a bid to have the suit dismissed Monday on jurisdictional grounds.  And rather than having him testify, the CFTC showed clips of a video deposition recorded last month in connection with the case.  According to Weinstein, the way the hearing played out actually opens the door to a new motion to dismiss, through which he could claim that the evidence put forward against him is insufficient for a criminal proceeding.  This is something that the judge mentioned before during the proceedings.  On Monday, Weinstein told McDonnell to ""make a motion that the burden of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt because of the nature of the charges and the fact that this evidence will be used against you should you be prosecuted for a crime based on these facts alleged and that the evidence that you are forced to give in order to defend yourself will be denied.""  While he then denied the motion, he told McDonnell that ""you may have it for purposes of appeal.""  Closing arguments  Weinstein indicated on Wednesday that he wants to give McDonnell yet another chance to argue in his own defense.  ""I'm concerned about the actions of the defendant but I didn't want to hold him in contempt,"" he said.  He told the lawyers representing the CFTC to ensure McDonnell knows he is welcome to appear in court on Thursday to make a closing argument as well as the possible motion to dismiss.  It is unclear at this point whether McDonnell will do so.  In a letter to the court on Wednesday, he wrote that ""my life is being lived hand-to-pocket sir with [this] case leaving me financially destitute with all debtors extended beyond extension.""  ""For the sake of pure minute-to-minute survival, I must continue to be removed from proceeding but will give it very serious consideration if current financial conditions change,"" he wrote.

It's not clear in what form the guidance will take, but the task force may ultimately produce some kind of report for the Trump administration on this front.  Yet it's not surprising that the administration would move in this direction. Earlier this year, the U.S. government indicated that it was working toward a ""comprehensive"" strategy around cryptocurrencies, with a focus on market fraud. In February, the U.S. Department of Justice formed a cybersecurity task force that includes cryptocurrencies as part of its mandate.  ""A lot of these schemes involve bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies which do not flow through the traditional financial system,"" Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said at the time.

42380982,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9395B,1531341941,Crypto Market Downturn Puts Drag on High-End GPU Prices,"New research suggests that prices for high-end graphics cards – coveted by both cryptocurrency miners and gamers alike – are falling.  The research was conducted by John Peddie Research, a tech marketing and consulting firm based in California. As tech publication Computerworld reported on Tuesday, the report shows higher-priced products from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Nvidia have dropped significantly from their highs experienced earlier this year.  For example, according to Jon Peddie Research, the price of an OEM 4GB RX 580 six-pack – a top-notch GPU from Advanced Micro Devices – was $3,600, having completely sold out as of April. But that product is available on the market for $2,500, a reduction of $1,100.  ""We have predicted a drop in [application specific processors] as [cryptocurrency] prices dropped,"" C. Robert Dow, manager of digital media at Jon Peddie Research, said in an email to the publication, adding:  ""The cost to run the mining rigs is not insignificant, so when the price for the currencies drop..., people will run rigs and choose to dump AIBs [add-in-board] on the secondary market hoping to recover some cost.""  Meanwhile, the research's data also show that the number of AIB shipments directly to cryptocurrency miners dropped about 55.5% compared to the same quarter of last year.  From the charts  Additional data provided by a website called PCPartPicker, which tracks the prices of computer components, also indicates that there is a general downtrend occurring for GPUs.  For example, the chart below shows price developments for the Radeon RX Vega 64 – a product hailed by some tech bloggers last year as a premier tool for mining cryptocurrencies. In spite of several short upticks, the price of that product seems to have peaked in early March.  Similar accolades  were published for the GeForce GTX 1070 Ti – but it, too, has seen a gradual price decline since around the same time.  Whether this means anything in the long-term remains to be seen – cryptocurrency mining is effectively an electricity arbitrage, where gains are made when the cost of mining (including hardware, energy and labor) is less than the return on the coins once sold.  Given that the cryptocurrency market has declined overall since early this year, demand would, in theory, fall in tandem with those figures.  More answers could come in the form of future financial results from Nvidia and AMD, both of which have made a point to discuss the impact of crypto mining on their bottom lines. While business was great by the end of last year, that state of affairs may be changing, according to these figures.

42380978,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93909,1531337739,Bitcoin Price Spikes to Nearly $9K on Little-Known Crypto Exchange,"For a cryptocurrency exchange that has seen its bitcoin price trade at a market premium since launch, the spike to nearly $9,000 on the WEX exchange on Wednesday was an outlier.  Some background: in July of last year, U.S. and international law enforcement took aim at BTC-e, the long-running – and long-mysterious – cryptocurrency exchange. In a dramatic turn, a Russian national and one of BTC-e's suspected employees was arrested and charged with laundering billions of dollars while American regulators moved to slap the exchange with a massive $110 million fine.  In the months since, BTC-e has returned under the WEX banner while Alexander Vinnik has been the subject of a legal tug-of-war between Russia, the U.S. and, now, France, each of which is seeking to extradite him. Vinnik has that he is innocent of the charges levied against him.  Yet Wednesday's move is a curious one, with the price of bitcoin (against the U.S. dollar) on WEX climbing to $8,999, as shown in the graph below.  By contrast, CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) hasn't climbed above $6,396 since the start of trading on July 11.  The sharp increase started around 16:00 (UTC) from a comparatively high price point of about $7,800. To put things in perspective, Coinbase, a competing US-based crypto exchange, featured bitcoin prices throughout the entirety of the day between the range of $6,200 and $6,400.  At press time, the cryptocurrency is trading at roughly $8,103, according to WEX figures.  So what gives?  As might be expected, the unexpected surge stoked speculation that WEX is either insolvent, suffering banking problems or gearing up for a calculated exit. BTC-e's long-mysterious reputation and links to the now-defunct dark market Silk Road may arguably have provided fuel for such allegations.  The move also comes a day before WEX will undergo a planned maintenance period scheduled to last for 2 hours, according to a post on Twitter from July 9.  For its part, the exchange hasn't commented on its public-facing channels about the price spike, and a message sent to WEX's official account on Twitter wasn't returned by press time.

42380962,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX938iX,1531330201,Report: Korean Political Parties to Propose New Crypto Laws,"South Korea's National Assembly is reportedly set to witness a whirlwind of legislative efforts around cryptocurrencies in the coming days.  Between July 13 and 26, members of a number of Korean political parties are expected to submit bills focused on regulating cryptocurrencies, initial coin offerings and blockchain, according to a report from The Korea Times.  Among the members who are expected to submit bills are Representative Park Yong-jin of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea, Representative Chung Tae-ok of the main opposition Liberty Party Korea (LPK) and Representative Choung Byoung-gug of the minor opposition Bareun Mirae Party.  While a flurry of activity is anticipated, it's not entirely clear how the process will play out. According to the Times, members of the Assembly ""remain widely divided"" on the issue. That said, the moves will nonetheless spark a fresh debate over the status of cryptocurrencies in the country, which is home to a vibrant community as well as a number of exchanges.  The focus on ICOs is especially notable, given that Korea was one of a number of countries to ban the blockchain funding model back in 2017.  One member of the Assembly is also holding an event later this month that could have implications for the country's domestic exchange ecosystem.  Rep. Song Hee-kyung, another assembly member from the LPK, will co-host a debate on security for domestic crypto exchanges with the Korea Internet and Security Agency (KISA), a government organization that supervises internet and cybersecurity issues, on July 19.  The event comes in the wake of twin exchange hacks – targeting Coinrail and Bithumb – both of which took place in June. The hacks have caused a loss of at least $70 million in total and triggered a wide discussion and critique among the country's crypto community.

Called DIRT, the San Francisco-based company said Wednesday that notable investment firms taking part in the round include Digital Currency Group, Pantera Capital, China-based Zhenfund and InBlockchain. Individual investors such as Linda Xie and Coinbase co-founder Fred Ersham also participated.  With the new financing finalized, DIRT's founder Yin Wu told CoinDesk in an interview that the protocol – also called DIRT – will be released in the next three to four months, together with a token that will be based on the ethereum standard ERC-20.  Wu said that the goal of the protocol is to serve as a platform where third-party decentralized application (dapp) developers can create what is called a token curated registry (TRC) – a similar concept to the way in which Wikipedia uses the community to update and verify its data. In essence, a TRC is a distributed data list focused on a certain topic that allows users to propose and validate what information should be on the list, using tokens to vote and back up positions.  Wu further explained:  ""If anyone in the network finds misinformation, they can also challenge the dataset and say this is incorrect. In order to initiate a challenge, you need a stake token. The challenge then begins with a vote. Anyone in the network can vote with tokens. ... Whoever wins the vote, wins the tokens; if you lose the vote or voted for the wrong side, then you are penalized.""  The company has not yet decided how it will distribute its tokens, however – though it will seek to do so as widely as possible. Wu did say the token should have a ""strong utility angle,"" since it is used to ""adjudicate whether information is correct.""  In addition, the company said upon the protocol's release that it will also launch a decentralized application that is developed internally, but declined to disclose more information for now.

The world's sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market value looks to have picked up a bid on reports that the Litecoin Foundation has acquired a 9.9 percent stake in Germany's WEG Bank through a new partnership with crypto-to-fiat payments provider TokenPay.  The strategic partnership has opened the doors for new consumer-focused crypto payment solutions, and, according to litecoin founder Charlie Lee, is a ""huge win-win"" for all parties.  While the news has certainly brought cheer to the battered litecoin bulls today, the technical charts remain biased to the bears.  At press time, LTC is trading at $79.50 – up 4.73 percent on a 24-hour basis, having lost more than 50 percent in the last two months. Trading volume for the last 24 hours is stagnant at just over $3 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.  Daily chart  Litecoin's decline from the session high of $81.00 marks a failure on the part of the bulls to cut through the falling trendline resistance.  The chart also shows a bearish crossover between the 5- and 10-day moving averages (MAs).  Further, the long-term MAs are positioned one below the other and are trending south in favor of the bears.  Thus, the path of least resistance is to the downside.  Weekly chart  On the longer-term chart above, the 5- and 10-week MAs are sloping downwards, indicating a bearish setup. The relative strength index (RSI) is hovering below 50.00 (in the bearish territory).  View  A break below $75.42 (today's low) would bolster the already bearish technical setup and could yield a drop to $69.00 (100-week MA).

It's a contrarian view, but it's the central idea behind one of last year's largest initial coin offerings (ICOs), which raised $98 million selling ethereum-based tokens created specifically for the messaging app company Kik.  To jumpstart a digital market around its code, the company announced Tuesday that it's committing up to $3 million in fiat and crypto to enlist developers in creating up to 25 marketplaces that only use kin, a cryptocurrency valued at roughly $100 million. These marketplaces could be anything from places to buy access to live video chats with influential YouTubers to very rare sticker packs they can use in chats.  As long as its all digital, that's the kind of market the firm wants to foster.  But while the Kik app is a natural place to host such markets, projects don't have to be built there per se, according to the newly released terms of the Kin Developer Program.  The initiative ""financially incentivizes developers to create natively with kin, bringing us closer to our goal of becoming the most used cryptocurrency in the world,"" Ted Livingston, CEO of Kik, said in a press release.  Developers have a chance to earn as much as $115,000 provided they meet three key milestones for their app by April 2019: They have until October 2 to build an app approved to run on its software development kit (SDK); until January to grow it to 10,000 monthly active wallets (MAWs); and until April to grow to 50,000 MAWs.  Each milestone comes with its own reward, with the full amount awarded to projects that hit all three.  Speed of crypto  The fund's roadmap is slated to move ahead just as quickly.  According to the Kin Ecosystem Foundation, the non-profit that oversees kin, the deadline for developers to apply to participate is August 10. The organization has committed to notifying applicants of its decision by August 15.  A spokesman for the foundation confirmed that these payments will be in lieu of payments from the Kin Rewards Engine (KRE), which is not yet live. In the original vision for the cryptocurrency, developers would create marketplaces, and smart contracts would reward them periodically in newly released kin tokens based on the amount of activity that took place.  Rather than wait for the KRE to be ready, though, the foundation is providing a different incentive system in the meantime, though it's arguably just as in line with the project's vision.  During a conference for the token in April, Livingston described a vision of an ecosystem of marketplaces for purely digital goods in which regular people could both earn and spend kin without ever thinking about converting it fiat.  At the time, he saw the concept as the only viable way forward for his company as Facebook and Google consumed the ad-driven app market. ""Our new plan was to develop a new economy around a new currency,"" he said.  Still, Livingston has repeatedly said kin needs to achieve three things to succeed. First, it needed a scaleable blockchain (which it believes it has built by forking Stellar); to integrate the Kik app with kin (which it announced late last month); and finally, it needed to grow its ecosystem.  This effort to recruit independent developers fits into that last goal. The foundation has promised to mentor and support developers throughout the six-month process.

42380988,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9393v,1531309844,Augur Passes CryptoKitties: Ethereum App Sees $400K in First-Day Betting,"One Augur user was so eager, they didn't even wait for the user interface.  That may have summed up the state of affairs Tuesday, hours after the Forecast Foundation, the non-profit behind the Augur protocol, announced the launch of its decentralized platform for betting on the outcome of events. By 5:00 UTC, the first prediction markets were being created, and by day's end, new bets were being placed on everything from U.S. elections to World Cup soccer games, all with the help of bleeding-edge tech.  ""Someone must've really wanted to be the first,"" another user remarked, as the discussion turned around how exactly the market (for betting on the winner of the England-Croatia World Cup match) had been created.  However, it's hard to say if the wider crypto world shared this early adopter's enthusiasm.  As decentralized applications (apps powered by blockchains but operated by no single entity) are a new phenomenon, there remain few ways to gauge whether one could meet any criteria for success. Still, a useful method might be to compare Augur's use to that of other major dapps, and on that front, there's an argument Augur is doing well.  Just over 12 hours after Augur's launch, the platform has become the fifth-most popular dapp on the ethereum blockchain by total users, according to DappRadar, putting it ahead of CryptoKitties, which has arguably been the perceived market leader since it went mainstream in December.  That makes Augur a big fish in a very small pond, though, with just 300 wallet addresses (a flawed proxy for users) interacting with its smart contracts. It does better – third place – in terms of the volume of ether those smart contracts have processed, as the figure is 910 ETH (or around $400,000). By comparison, CryptoKitties saw just 23 ETH (or $10,000) in volume.  But metrics aside, Augur's promise of low-fee wagering that governments can't easily disrupt surely has its fans (and detractors) who were there to assess the launch. On the latter front, it seems that Augur didn't live up to the outsized demands of some of its supporters.  One user posted to the project's Discord forum following the launch:  ""I was hoping institutions would be on Augur right away, but I guess that was naive.""  Defining success  Viewed in the context of its cryptocurrency peers, there's a strong argument Augur's launch was a success.  Gaining a couple hundred daily users is rare for a dapp (just look at the hundreds of single-user examples listed on DappRadar). And a smooth launch – a launch of any kind – counts for something in the world of blockchain, where so many projects spectacularly self-immolate, or simply never materialize.  Nic Carter, co-founder of Coinmetrics.io, a site that provides and analyzes data on public blockchains, seemed to endorse this view when he tweeted, ""Real volume on Augur already!""  On the other hand, there were high hopes around Augur, so more-than-zero is unlikely to have satisfied everyone.  Kyle Samani, co-founder and managing partner of Multicoin Capital, a cryptocurrency investment fund, told CoinDesk in June, ""I think Augur's going to be probably the most widely used dapp when it launches.""  He added, ""I know a lot of my friends that are pretty excited about Augur who are not in the crypto space. They work in finance on Wall Street and they want to go place bets and make markets on Augur, so I think Augur's going to be a pretty resounding success when it launches.""  Then again, Samani's tone was more muted a few weeks later. ""Not sure how much demand there will be,"" he told CoinDesk a few days prior to the launch. The team, he said, wanted the process to be ""slow and steady.""  UX issues  But as is often the case with ethereum – and blockchain networks broadly – complaints about Augur come down to user experience.  Posts in the Discord forum revolved around a few repeated gripes: high gas costs (in fact costs tended not to be as high as estimated costs, which put users off), the Augur app repeatedly disconnecting (this was certainly our experience) and slow syncing (including, cruelly, getting stuck for minutes at 99 percent).  A popular Reddit post addressed ""dear Augur guys"" urged them to ""put yourselves in the shoe of the end user,"" who – the post's author argued – were likely to run into problems, give up, and not return.  Some issues – the Augur app's tendency to repeatedly disconnect, for example – may not be the developers' fault, at least not directly. Users who are not running their own ethereum node were given the option to connect through Infura, which some users in Discord said was experiencing more traffic than it could handle.  An Infura spokesperson told CoinDesk that the ""entire team is on a video chat with the Augur team working on the issues,"" adding, ""It is premature to wholly attribute the issue to one particular cause.""  And Brendan Bernstein, a founding partner at Tetras Capital, argued that the problems with using Infura go beyond poor connectivity, writing, ""Apps like Augur will further centralize Ethereum, by effectively forcing users to rely on trusted validators"" such as Infura.  Give it a minute  Still, Augur's team was quick to put forth the argument that all will be better with time.  Platform founder Joey Krug, in particular, took to Twitter to answer critics of the app's user experience, tweeting: ""Everyone knows the Augur UX is bad right now because of issues that only appeared on mainnet in production, pointing it out on twitter isn't saying anything useful/productive.""  There's still plenty of time for Augur to work out its user experience kinks and attract more gamblers – including perhaps Wall Streeters – developers involved in the project emphasized.  ""This is the first step of a long journey,"" Forecast Foundation co-founder and senior developer Joey Krug told CoinDesk a few minutes before announcing Augur's launch.  Meanwhile Ryan Berckmans, co-founder of Predictions.Global, which provides a web-based user interface for Augur markets, concluded:  ""A platform like Augur needs to build a history of reliability before serious money moves in, this is a trend we've seen with blockchains in general like ethereum and bitcoin.""

42380983,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9396R,1531306801,Bitcoin's Price May Be Charting a Bull Reversal,"Bitcoin (BTC) price could create a major bullish technical pattern in the next few days, technical charts indicate.  It's a slightly confusing picture at the moment, however. The recent short-term bullish bias has been neutralized following BTC's close below (as per UTC) the 10-day moving average (MA) yesterday.  Further, the risk of a deeper pullback to $6,000 (February low and psychological support) look to have increased after Tuesday's 5.7 percent price drop.  However, that does not necessarily mean the bears are back in a commanding position, since the cryptocurrency is still holding well above the recent low of $5,755 (hit on June 24).  Notably, BTC could end up creating an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern (bullish pattern) soon if the bears fail to penetrate the immediate support of $6,000 in the next couple of days.  At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,350 on Bitfinex – down 3.6 percent on a 24-hour basis.  Daily chart  BTC's drop to $6,260 yesterday left another lower high (bearish pattern) on the daily chart, while the relative strength index (RSI) has rolled over in favor of the bears (is back below 50.00).  The 5-day and 10-day MAs are also beginning to slope downwards in favor of the bears.  The long-term MAs – 50, 100 and 200 – are located one below the other, indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside.  Thus, BTC looks set to test $6,000 in the next day or two. Acceptance below that level would expose the recent low of $5,755.  However, the short duration charts indicate BTC will likely defend the support at $6,000.  4-hour chart  The RSI is already reporting oversold conditions (below 30.00) and another $300 drop would only make it harder for the bears to push BTC below $6,000.  Hence, we are unable to rule out a rebound from $6,000 – a move which could end up creating the right shoulder of an inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal pattern, as seen in the chart below.  Daily chart: Potential inverse head-and-shoulders pattern  A long-term bull reversal (bear-to-bull trend change) would be confirmed if BTC bounces off the support at $6,000 and sees a high volume break above $6,832 (neckline resistance).  The probability of BTC completing the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern remains high as long as prices are holding above $6,000.  View  BTC's close below 10-day MA yesterday has neutralized the immediate bullish outlook.  The immediate support at $6,000 could be put to test in the next day or two, but the probability of a break below that level is low.  A high volume rebound from $6,000 would help BTC chart an inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal pattern.  A daily close (as per UTC) below $6,000 would boost the odds of a drop below $5,755 (June 24 low).

The deal comes as the result of an agreement with TokenPay, a crypto-to-fiat payments firm, according to an announcement on Tuesday.  TokenPay has now passed ownership of the 9.9 percent of equity in WEG Bank AG to Litecoin Foundation in exchange for the latter's technical assistance in advancing the bank's plans to bring cryptocurrency payment solutions to customers and working with TokenPay on its various blockchain projects.  Charlie Lee, managing director of the Litecoin Foundation, said in the release:  ""I'm looking forward to integrating Litecoin with the WEG Bank AG and all the various services it has to offer, to make it simple for anyone to buy and use Litecoin.""  TokenPay purchased the stake in WEG Bank for an undisclosed amount in May, and said in the release that it has also just acquired an additional 9.9 percent. The firm eventually plans to exercise its option to purchase the remaining shares of the bank if approved by German regulators, it said.  According to an announcement from TokenPay in May, the funds for the acquisition were derived from a token sale conducted in December 2017.  Launched in 2015, TokenPay built its own blockchain protocol and native TPAY token in an effort to facilitate scalable crypto-to-fiat transactions.  WEG Bank specifically focuses on offering financial services to real-estate customers. The bank's founder and chief executive, Matthias von Hauff, said the deal was not initially expected from a ""very conservative"" institution such as itself, and only came about after much thought about the future of cryptocurrency.  Von Hauff explained:  ""We have thoroughly and diligently examined the prospects of a common future, and we became convinced that the future of banking will make adoption of such modern payment methods inevitable.""

42380971,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX938rL,1531296005,UK Financial Regulators Are Preparing for a World of Crypto Assets,"Blockchain crowdfunding ideas may be ten-a-penny these days, but seeing the concept tested out by a financial regulator and a major stock exchange is pretty unique.  Still, that's what's happening now in the U.K. where the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) and U.K. financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), are working with distributed ledger technology startup Nivaura and 20|30, a UK company building a blockchain platform for corporate equity issuance.  One of the more exciting projects within the fourth cohort of the FCA's regulatory sandbox (some 40 percent of the cohort use distributed ledgers), the collaboration will target institutional as well as accredited investors using the LSEG's Turquoise, the hybrid exchange platform for European equities that allows trading both on and off traditional exchanges.  The aim is to demonstrate for the first time in a live deal that equity in a U.K. company can be tokenized and issued within a fully compliant custody, clearing and settlement system.  As such, the first company to test out a primary issuance of tokenized stock will be 20|30 itself in September of this year, a launch to be followed by a one year lock-in period according to Tomer Sofinzon, co-founder of 20|30.  20|30 says that as soon as the first testing phase is complete, there exists a pipeline of dozens of young companies looking to try the tokenizing process out. These include medical device makers, firms in the pharmaceutical space, agricultural companies, and software providers.  Since the equity tokens being issued will be built on ethereum, trading of these will presumably start to happen, at least on an over-the-counter (OTC) basis, once the lock-in period has passed.  ""That's absolutely possible,"" said Sofinzon. ""After the lock-in period, we can begin the next phase, to really test the tradeability.""  The test follows a number of similar efforts to make more liquid markets for equity crowdfunding using blockchain tech, including the Korea Exchange which launched the Korea Startup Market for trading tokens OTC back in 2016.  The London Stock Exchange said in a statement to CoinDesk it is exploring blockchain as a way to help SMEs and to ""innovate the issuance and tokenization of securities enabled for execution and settlement within the LSEG Conduct of Business framework.""  ""This project with Nivaura is exploring tools to help companies raise capital in a more efficient and streamlined way,"" said the LSEG.  Equity tokens  But while a big step for incumbents, the project is also a boon for the startups involved.  Taking a gradual step-by-step approach Nivaura has shown that debt securities can be tokenized in a regulatory compliant manner and cleared and settled on a public blockchain such as ethereum. Nivaura has, in fact, executed three issuances in the FCA sandbox as a participant in two previous cohorts.  The ramifications of tokenized equity being distributed via an exchange are weighty, but the initial problem the project set out to solve is the inefficiency of equity crowdfunding, which essentially operates a bilateral relationship between the share issuer and the investor.  But, institutional investors don't work like that. They require a trusted market infrastructure, supplied in this case by Nivaura, leveraged by the LSEG's network and ability to generate sell orders and buy orders on a grand scale.  Speaking exclusively to CoinDesk about the project, Dr. Avtar Sehra, CEO and chief product architect at Nivaura, said: ""Someone can use our technology to do all the legal documentation, tokenize these assets and execute them. LSEG has then been forward-thinking enough to help get these orders out to the existing market""  That said, tokenized equity is a tough nut to crack. Oftentimes, people talk about equity tokenization that's just tokenized digital certificates which are not transferable, explained Sehra.  Debt is more straightforward, he said, because the token is the bond. ""Equity is driven by legislation and the legislation makes it very hard for the token to be equity itself.""  Looking ahead  Designing the legal structure around the equity token meant creating a legal markup language and ensuring compliance with Central Securities Depositories Regulation (CSDR), which Nivaura has been working on with law firms like Allen & Overy and, as part of the latest FCA cohort, Latham & Watkins.  Once there is a certain legal structure around the token, that gives the holder of that token the right to the equity and the right to all the beneficial interest in that equity, said Sehra, permitting a forward glance at the next possible phase of the project.  ""If we can guarantee this is the most commercially viable way to do this, it will not only allow efficient primary distribution but it's also going to potentially allow very simple secondary trading as well.""  ""There is a possibility that we are going to be launching that next year.""  It's worth mentioning that since the settlement layer is the ethereum public blockchain it would be bounded by a throughput limit of about 15 transactions per second, for the time being at least until the technology improves.  Sehra acknowledged that throughput and latency are huge issues for public blockchains, but said that for the purpose of this project over the next two to three years it's sufficient.  He concluded:  ""The industry is going to become a world of tokenized assets – that's inevitable. We don't really care if it's ethereum or bitcoin, the underlying infrastructure isn't that important. But it is going to be a blockchain.""

The browser maker said Wednesday that its ""new version of the Opera browser for Android… combines easy-to-use crypto wallet functionality with support for the Ethereum Web3 API."" The browser is currently in private beta, which the company is now inviting new users to join.  This means users no longer have to open a new web browser or download a separate extension to send, receive and pay in cryptocurrency – now they can do so directly from a toggle on their browsers on mobile Android devices.  It is an especially useful announcement for developers of decentralized web applications – more commonly known as dapps – given that the new browser functionality indicates users can now more easily interact with dapps being built on the ethereum network.  Charles Hamel, the product lead on Opera Crypto, explained in a statement:  ""We believe the web of today will be the interface to the decentralized web of tomorrow…By becoming the the first major browser to open up to Web 3.0, we would like to contribute to making the internet of the future more accessible.""  Boost to Web 3.0  That term ""Web 3.0"" refers to the vision of a decentralized Internet built on top of the ethereum blockchain that connects users to various dapps and peer-to-peer networks.  As previously reported, some dapps such WeiFund have already been developed for the express purpose of being used on Web 3.0-enabled browsers equipped with embedded wallets.  In effect, the newly released browser with built-in crypto wallet functionality by Opera boasts a ""simple"" user interface that builds on ""existing browser wallets/dapp browsers...with a default WebView.""  As such, the company expects to lower ""the entry barrier to Web 3.0 for users"" and offer the path for those wanting to ""venture into the world of dapps and cryptocurrencies.""

42429386,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxnVh,1531289704,Philippines Regulator Aims to Make $67 Million From Crypto Exchange Licensing,"The authority that governs the Philippines Cagayan Special Economic Zone and Freeport is aiming to earn $67 million just by issuing cryptocurrency exchange licenses.  According to a report from the country's government news agency on Tuesday, the Cagayan Economic Zone Authority (CEZA) has announced it has just granted a principle operation license to a Hong Kong-based crypto exchange.  The CEZA said the new issuance is part of the total 25 principle licenses it will hand out to crypto trading platforms. And each of those authorized companies will be allowed to further issue at least four regular licenses, according to the report.  The agency's senior deputy administrator, Raymundo Roquero, said that the CEZA charges $360,000 for a principle license and $85,000 for a regular one, but the report does not further clarify the main differences between these two types of licenses.  Through the tiered exchange licensing model, Roquero said that the authority expects to make a profit of 3.6 billion pesos, or around $67 million.  In addition to the one-off licensing fee, approved exchanges are also required to pay the CEZA 0.1 percent of the value of each transaction that happens on their platforms, the report said.  Roquero indicated that the CEZA has received 70 applications so far and will issue more licenses in the coming months since six of the applicants have already paid the licensing fee.  As part of the license's requirement, crypto exchanges registered in the special economic zone must also locally invest at least $1 million within two years, and have a back office in the Philippines, the report said.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, the Philippines released a guideline for bitcoin exchanges in early 2017, but received little interest in the time since.

42429378,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxnHh,1531281644,Regulators Are Slowly Starting to Get It: Utility Tokens Are Real,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      ""I want to quash this false narrative that's been going around for the past two years that you can separate blockchain from crypto. You can't.""  No, that's not a bitcoin maximalist, a HODLer or a crypto-anarchist talking. It's a regulator.  And Sopnendu Mohanty, the chief fintech officer of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, wasn't preaching to the crypto-converted, either, when he issued this reminder that native tokens are integral to a decentralized blockchain.  Rather, he was addressing a room full of curious but wary central bankers and international development officials, all of whom were attending a G20 forum in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on technology and financial inclusion.  It was refreshing to hear someone in the official sector take issue with the simplistic ""blockchain without bitcoin"" refrain that gets sold to corporate and government leaders who don't always realize that their problems might be better solved with a less cumbersome distributed database.  That wasn't only because it's important for people to understand how native digital tokens are an integral part of the incentive and security models upon which open, permissionless and censorship-resistant transaction-recording systems are built. It was also because Mohanty's intent was to help shape sensible crypto regulation.  He was urging regulators to adopt nuanced policies that recognize certain crypto-tokens belong to a new type of technology for improving economic coordination, one that can't be jammed into a decades-old securities law framework. And it's also encouraging to see evidence that he's not alone in thinking this way.  Various regulatory authorities around the world are opening up to the idea that, when tokens have a clearly functional role within a blockchain network, it's better to manage them with existing consumer protection and anti-money-laundering laws than with burdensome securities regulation.  To be sure, they're doing so somewhat nervously; many are understandably concerned about investors being duped by scammy ICOs in Wild West token markets.  Nonetheless, their gradual yet earnest attempts to define these concepts open the door to blockchain technology's more meaningful integration into the global economy.  Forward-thinking states  Here, Singapore's central bank is leading the way. In a March speech, MAS Managing Director Ravi Menon laid out a clear rationale for distinguishing ""good"" tokens from ""the bad and the ugly.""  The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, or FINMA, has also been proactive. It came up with a useful taxonomy that divides tokens into three categories: payment tokens (bitcoin, litecoin and co.), utility tokens (ether and, in theory at least, various kinds of ERC-20 tokens) and asset tokens, with only the latter being subject to securities laws.  Other developed-country jurisdictions are also wading in. Both Malta and the U.K. dependency Gibraltar have shown an open regulatory posture toward ICOs and token exchanges. Meanwhile, Caribbean countries such as Bermuda are developing regulatory frameworks for tokens that would promote blockchain innovation while preserving their status as trusted domiciles for foreign financial institutions.  Governments are also taking action at the provincial level. Wyoming's state legislature passed legislation defining utility tokens as a new asset class and exempting them from securities regulations.  Until last month, it appeared that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was taking the exact opposite approach. In February, Chairman Jay Clayton, speaking before the Senate, said, ""I believe every ICO I've seen is a security."" The implication was clear: most, if not all, of the hundreds of tokens already sold in this manner should have registered with the SEC and complied with related disclosure and compliance requirements.  In stoking fears of a dragnet approach from the SEC against all tokens, this statement prompted ICO issuers to ring-fence themselves from the U.S. markets. It also gave a boost to purveyors of ""security tokens,"" who don't pretend to be inventing anything more than a more efficient means of selling securities to investors.  But since then, the SEC has also softened its stance. Clayton later told CNBC that bitcoin would not be classified as a security. And, then, in a landmark speech last month, William Hinman, the SEC's director of the Division of Corporate Finance, answered a question that had been nagging the ethereum community. While Hinman suggested that ether might have been a security at the time of the ethereum proto-ICO in 2014, he said it does not meet that definition today because of how it functions within the ethereum network.  This was not as proactive as other jurisdictions' moves to explicitly carve out the concept of a utility token. Hinman was merely defining what ether was not. But by coming to that conclusion, he had recognized the unique qualities of this particular token: how ether is a kind of ""crypto fuel,"" used to pay for the decentralized computation by which smart contracts are executed on the ethereum platform.  What's important is that regulators are doing their homework and starting to recognize there's at least potentially something different going on here from what they're used to seeing. There's a lot of learning still to come, but light bulbs are quietly going off in different corners of the regulatory world.  Whether you're in the camp that welcomes regulatory clarity to foster public confidence in this technology or among those in the crypto community who see government engagement as anathema to a system of money originally designed to bypass the state, this emerging regulatory awareness represents a seminal moment.  The race is on  Clearly, many countries taking these steps have their eyes on the potential economic gains generated by the freewheeling ICO market, one that has raised $20 billion so far and which, with $275 billion in (admittedly poorly measured) market capitalization, has come to constitute a significant parallel capital market. There are tax windfalls to be had and there's the real prize of attracting innovation to their shores.  They need to be careful, though, as this is an exceptionally fleet-footed form of capital. They risk encouraging global ""regulatory arbitrage."" When a technology is as geography-agnostic as this, its users will often choose their home base depending on where regulation is lightest, stoking competition among jurisdictions. Given the inordinate number of scammers in the ICO business, the danger is that the worst players gain too much freedom and, by extension, too much influence over how this industry is broadly perceived.  In times past, U.S. regulators could rise above such problems. The sheer amount of money raised in the U.S. left global actors with no option but to comply with their rules just to ensure access to it. But with foreign capital markets deeper in the age of globalization, globally distributed blockchain development teams are deciding that the U.S. just might not be worth it. We are already seeing ICO issuers deciding that they can comfortably raise all they need from Asian investors.  Where this is all pointing, I hope, is to a coordinated international effort to better harmonize the regulatory approach.  Mohanty told me he sees six or so of the world's more important regulators coming to a broad agreement on utility tokens and on what distinguishes them from payment and security vehicles. There's a need, for example, to define pressing questions about what level of platform functionality, and when, a token must have to earn exempt utility status. And, beyond the securities laws exemptions, regulators should agree on strategies to apply existing consumer protection laws to ensure that ICO issuers are still held to account for the promises they make to people who put money into their token pre-sales.  Some have forcefully argued that carving out explicit legislative definitions of a utility token – a la Wyoming – overly constrains innovators to those definitions and creates contradictions across jurisdictions. Better to rely on existing laws than to add to the body of legislation, they say. But such concerns should not prevent regulators from creating clearly signaled guidelines to participants in the blockchain development community about how they will apply existing law to different scenarios.  There's a still a lot of work needed to improve and scale blockchain technology and to foster broad confidence among future buyers of crypto tokens. Best practices among issuers, exchanges and investors/buyers need to be developed. But encouraging the expansion of utility token models is a worthy goal, one that's much harder to achieve if the burdens of securities laws were to be imposed on all those who create them.  To understand this, one need look no further than the financial inclusion objectives of the Riyadh-based conference that Mohanty spoke athttps://www.gpfi.org/sites/default/files/documents/180626_forum_agenda.pdf. Organized by the Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion under the leadership of Argentina, which holds the G20's current presidency, the event explored, among other goals, how to encourage entrepreneurship in low-income, developing countries.  If we want the whole world, include enterprising people in such countries, to have access to the powerful economic advantages of decentralized, peer-to-peer applications and business models, regulatory barriers to entry must be softened.  This is, in other words, a cause for humanity.  Sunrise at Lincoln Monument via Shutterstock.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Michael J.
