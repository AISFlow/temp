42427697,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL2yth,1502626220,LedgerX and CBOE: The CFTC's Trojan Horse in an SEC Turf War,"Benjamin Sauter and David McGill of Kobre & Kim LLP are civil litigators and criminal and regulatory defense attorneys. They are also part of the Digital Currency & Ledger Defense Coalition, a group of over 50 lawyers dedicated to protecting US blockchain innovators.  In this opinion piece, Sauter and McGill examine how a new class of cryptocurrency-based financial products could impact the balance of power between US regulators.      There is more than meets the eye to recent announcements that LedgerX and CBOE will soon be offering digital currency derivatives in the U.S.  In addition to delivering new financial products to the public, these initiatives may also usher the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) into the underlying digital currency markets. If so, this would be a regime change in how cryptocurrency trading is regulated, particularly with respect to manipulative or disruptive trading practices.  In light of recent reports of rampant ""spoofing"" and ""wash trading"" in some markets, the CFTC may be called upon to rule with an iron fist.  At the same time, the recent announcement that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will consider many (if not all) new currency offerings as ""securities"" portends a looming game of thrones for regulatory dominance in these markets.  The Westeros of digital currency trading  Currently, the CFTC is ""beyond the wall"" of the digital currency markets.  This is because, as a general matter, the CFTC regulates the trading of commodity derivatives (for example, wheat futures and options), not the trading of underlying commodities themselves (for example, wheat).  The CFTC has designated bitcoin and other virtual currencies as ""commodities,"" thereby removing them from the ordinary scope of what the the CFTC regulates. As readers may recall, the CFTC's lack of oversight in this area, and the possibility of unregulated manipulation in the digital currency markets, was a key reason why the SEC recently denied a bid by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss for approval of an exchange-traded bitcoin ETF.  There are two primary exceptions to the rule that the CFTC does not oversee commodities trading:  First, as brandished in the CFTC's enforcement action against Bitfinex in June 2016, an obscure provision of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act gives the CFTC jurisdiction over commodities trading when: (a) the trading is done on a leveraged or margined basis, and (b) the commodity is not actually delivered to the customer within 28 days.  Due to a quirk in how Bitfinex held the private keys for customer bitcoins, the CFTC found that these conditions were met and, therefore, that Bitfinex should have been registered with the CFTC. Bitfinex agreed to settle the matter, so the CFTC’s interpretation remains untested and open to dispute in court.  In any event, the CFTC's enforcement action was largely hollow because digital currency exchanges now appear to be sidestepping this jurisdictional provision by ensuring ""actual delivery"" of customer private keys. Thus, this provision is unlikely to sustain meaningful regulation by the CFTC of the digital currency markets.  Second, the CFTC has brought enforcement actions for manipulative trading in underlying commodity markets (such as silver) when that trading also affects derivatives markets subject to CFTC oversight.  Again, this basis for the CFTC's jurisdiction is open to dispute in court, but it is clear that the CFTC believes it has this authority. By extension, one could expect the CFTC to assert some degree of authority over digital currency trading to the extent that trading impacts digital currency derivatives markets.  The CFTC's gambit  To date, there have been no digital currency derivatives markets in the U.S. to speak of, and thus no opening for the CFTC to break through the jurisdictional wall separating it from the underlying digital currency markets. (Recall that the CFTC tried to shut down derivatives trading on Derivabit and TerraExchange in 2015.)  This is why the CFTC's recent approval of LedgerX and anticipated approval of CBOE for digital currency derivatives trading is so significant.  With digital currency derivatives trading set to begin, the CFTC may well have found the jurisdictional allies it needs to breach the wall. At a minimum, one can expect the CFTC to assert authority over trading practices on the underlying digital currency markets that provide reference prices for the newly approved derivatives products.  But because the digital currency markets and related derivatives markets are all linked through arbitrage, there may be no natural stopping point once the CFTC crosses the threshold. That could mean a new regulator sitting on the digital throne.  Wars to come  Not to be outdone, the SEC has also been busy plotting its own run at the throne.  The SEC's recently published ""Report of Investigation"" on The DAO and Slock.it signals that new coin offerings may be deemed ""securities"" subject to SEC oversight.  A key implication of this finding is that the secondary trading of these securities would fall under the SEC's Section 10(b) anti-fraud mandate – including its prohibitions on market manipulation and insider trading. In other words, the SEC appears to have just carved for itself a large slice of the underlying digital currency markets, at least with respect to newly issued digital currencies.  Given that the CFTC has already found digital currencies to constitute ""commodities"" within the meaning of the Commodity Exchange Act, there is tension between these two regulatory campaigns.  Which agency would regulate the secondary trading of a new coin offering that serves as a reference price for a derivatives contract?  This regulatory conflict is not unique to digital currencies, and the SEC and the CFTC may end up sharing power as they do with other single-security futures products. But security futures products are subject to an arcane set of rules and joint-registration requirements that are sure to chill the digital currency trading environment.  Prepare for a long winter  Regardless of whether the SEC, the CFTC or both ultimately assert power over trading in the digital currency markets, recent developments suggest that a new regime is coming. Digital currency traders in the U.S. and abroad should prepare for a long winter of uncertainty and, ultimately, regulatory scrutiny of trading practices.

42427691,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL2ylh,1502622011,Solving the Liquidity Challenge of Decentralized Exchanges,"Loi Luu is the co-founder and CEO ofKyberNetwork, a decentralized, trustless, cryptocurrency exchange.  In this opinion piece, Luu discusses the challenges facing technologists seeking to popularize decentralized exchanges for cryptocurrency trading, framing liquidity as one of the key obstacles to production.      The total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies is now above $137 billion, up from $16 billion at the beginning of the year.  But before the world can conduct a significant amount of its transactions via cryptocurrency markets, the problem of liquidity must be addressed.  Liquidity refers to the extent to which a market allows assets to be bought and sold at stable prices. Lower liquidity tends to result in a more volatile market (especially when large orders are placed), and it causes prices to change more drastically; whereas higher liquidity creates a less volatile market, and prices do not fluctuate as significantly.  Today, cash is the most liquid asset. If a transaction of $1 million takes place, the market is able to absorb that transaction easily without the value of the dollar drastically changing. Costs associated with the transaction, and the value of the currency at the time of the transaction, are also known beforehand.  However, the same transaction in bitcoin, or any other cryptocurrency, has a much greater effect on the cryptocurrency's value.  This is because of the market's lack of liquidity. The amount of cryptocurrency available on a specific trading platform can run out, requiring the buyer to complete the transaction at 1–10 percent more than expected.  To complete the same transaction of $1 million, it could end up costing between $10,000 and $100,000 more than the original price to make the trade.  Decentralized trading platforms  Until now, the cryptocurrency space has been dominated by centralized exchanges that help facilitate transaction from government currencies to cryptocurrencies.  Centralized exchanges, like Coinbase, are easy to access and easy to use. However, as many have failed to adequately secure their customers' funds, decentralized exchanges are becoming a popular concept.  Centralized exchanges have been simply unprepared for the recent influx of users, causing major system failures and attracting the attention of hackers. While some centralized exchanges are more secure than others, there's still been a number of security failures, like last year's Bitfinex hack, which resulted in thousands of users losing their savings (until it was later repaid).  Decentralized trading platforms offer an alternative, and perhaps even more valuable service, by promising greater security and transparency. They do not rely on third-party services to hold customer funds. Instead, peer-to-peer transactions are possible through an automated process.  The benefit of using a decentralized exchange is that there is no need to put any trust in the exchange platform itself, as the funds are held by the user in a personal wallet, rather than with a third party. Decentralized exchanges can also provide more privacy, while reducing the risk of server downtime, if only for those who are more tech-savvy.  Unfortunately, decentralized trading platforms still lack the commodity, easy of use, and overall ""user support"" to attract a mainstream user base. Therefore, the liquidity and market depth of these exchanges is still quite low.  Addressing the liquidity challenge  Improving the liquidity in decentralizing trading platforms is one way to help encourage mainstream adoption. Of course, many factors contribute to the liquidity of an asset. But, if the ways in which consumers make monetary transactions using cryptocurrencies could be simplified, then it's not difficult to imagine that the demand for such assets would increase.  There's little doubt that trading cryptocurrencies will continue to take place on different kinds of exchanges for the foreseeable future without a single, more stable asset emerging to keep their value in check. This means that overcoming market fragmentation and liquidity problems will require a unique solution.  One approach to solving the challenges that exist in decentralized exchanges is to reduce the cost of the switch for cryptocurrency traders. If an on-chain platform can tap into multiple reserves, and lower the barriers of switching from one exchange to another by working with various wallet providers, then users can log into their wallets and execute a token conversion without ever leaving their wallets.  This allows receipts to access payments from any token that a decentralized platform supports.  Token-to-token convertibility is not the only approach to solving the liquidity challenge. There are many other unique ideas on how to help users execute cross-network transactions seamlessly and at reasonable rates – and these solutions are opening up entirely new ways for the greater public to participate in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.  Furthermore, liquidity is not the only factor in the adoption of the technology, but it stands to be a critical component in how the market matures. Promoting liquidity in the blockchain ecosystem, and specifically in decentralized exchanges, will be key to improving the general public's perception of cryptocurrencies as a valuable way to trade currencies safely and securely.

42427708,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL2zDh,1502617843,"Bitcoin Prices Pass $4,000 for the First Time","The continuing surge in the price of bitcoin has seen it climb to over $4,000 for the first time since the cryptocurrency was created in January 2009.  According to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, the average price of bitcoin across global exchanges today reached a height of $4,225 at 9:07 a.m. UTC, having opened at $3,917. At press time, the price had dropped slightly to $4,162.  The new record follows days in which bitcoin has been setting consecutive all-time highs following a relatively static period when prices sat at around $2,700. That lull indicated a cautious market in the approach to the bitcoin fork that created a new cryptocurrency, bitcoin cash, on August 1.  Fears over the split, that some feared would lead to instability, now seem to be allayed, as indicated by the positive price moves since.  The total value of all cryptocurrencies has also set yet another new all-time high, with the combined market capitalization now sitting at over $137 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. That figure is $11 billion more than the previous high noted by CoinDesk just two days ago, when all crypto assets had a value of $126 billion.  While bitcoin has seen an over 10 percent increase in market cap in the past 24 hours, some other cryptocurrencies have seen increases of over 20 percent, including IOTA and neo, and others have even seen increases of around 30 percent, including decent, nexus and binance coin.  Not all cryptocurrencies have faired so well, though, with ethereum showing -4 percent for the last 24 hours, Ripple, -5.5 percent, and bitcoin cash, -8.2.
