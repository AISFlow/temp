3849011,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=507383,1666396254,Polkadot Price Forecast: Is Buying In The DOT Dip A Smart Move?,"A dip is common in the cryptocurrency market during a bearish downtrend. Most times, it could persist for a prolonged period. The current crypto winter of 2022 has seen the value of many coins drop. Investors are carefully weighing their options and considering if buying the dip is a smart move in the current market. Some investors move their assets to perceived safer ground as they brave the storm. In a price chart, a dip is identified as a valley. For Polkadot, expert predictions are varied on when the coin will eventually make the much-anticipated price comeback. Related Reading: Flow Rolls Out Blockchain Tools As Social Dominance, Coin Price Seen Rising Polkadot is way off its all-time high of $54.98 as of November 2021 to a modest $5.58, which is an exponential drop for the coin. DOT is unique since the project focuses on parachains that interlink with each other. These parachains are customized project-specific blockchains intertwined with the relay chain of Polkadot. The relay chain - the Polkadot network, secures and connects these parachains in numbers between 100 -250. Price Forecast For Polkadot The current market trend was also observed with Polkadot since it has been in a bearish reversal for months in 2022. The price movement for DOT will depend largely on the activity of market forces.

The largest cryptocurrency by market value remained above this threshold for the 14th consecutive day as investors continued to digest a range of issues that have been plaguing markets for weeks or longer.  Bitcoin was recently trading at about $19,200, up ever so slightly from 24 hours earlier. Ether was recently changing hands just below the $1,300 level that has been its primary compass point for more than a month. Other major altcoins were largely flat, although XRP was up over 3%.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures the performance of a basket of cryptocurrencies, recently rose 0.6%.  Bitcoin (BTC) was recently trading at about $19,200, roughly where it stood Thursday, same time, and near the bottom of the $19,000 to $21,000 range BTC has held for more than a month. Trading volume remained moderate.  Ether’s (ETH) was recently changing hands just below $1,300, also about the same from Thursday, and near its bottom support for much of the past month.  Among the top altcoin gainers recently were XRP and EOS, which both climbed about 3%. Earlier in the day, Aptos’ APT token rose 4.5% to recover from its bumpy start a few days before. AXIE was off about 6%.  Macro View  Traditional financial markets ended the week on a high with the tech-heavy Nasdaq, Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and S&P 500 all gaining close to 2.5%. The first two weeks of third-quarter earnings have been better than expected, despite gloomy economic forecasts. Investors continued to chew over high inflation, a downtrodden yen and a U.K. government in turmoil. Data showed that bitcoin’s 30-day price volatility is now almost identical to that of the U.K.’s currency.  In commodities, Brent crude oil, a measure of energy markets, ticked up slightly to trade over $93 per barrel, up more than 15% from the start of the year. Safe-haven gold climbed 1.6% to trade at $1,654 per ounce.  The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates by another 75 basis points during its next meeting on Nov. 2-3, but futures traders now anticipate the central bankers to moderate their current monetary hawkishness.  The CME FedWatch tool currently shows that traders see a 50-50 chance that the Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will raise rates by 50 basis points in December. The more optimistic sentiment follows remarks on Friday by San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, who said that “the time is now to start talking about stepping down – the time is now to start planning for stepping down.”  Latest Prices  ● CoinDesk Market Index (CMI): 935.73 +1.1%        ● Bitcoin (BTC): $19,184 +0.8%        ● Ether (ETH): $1,303 +1.5%        ● S&P 500 daily close: 3,752.75 +2.4%        ● Gold: $1,660 per troy ounce +1.8%        ● Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 4.21% −0.01        Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time.

Technical Take  Bitcoin Continues to Ride Area of Support; Volatility Still Low  By Glenn Williams Jr  Not much has changed for bitcoin (BTC) in the most recent seven days, or the most recent three months for that matter. BTC prices remain range-bound and, at just south of $20,000, is trading almost identically to its June price level.  One of the more interesting themes for bitcoin in 2022 has been the lack of volatility in overall BTC daily price movement.  The price is down approximately 3% for October, having opened the month at $19,400 compared with its current $19,100.  BTC appears to be firmly entrenched along a line of support, with little impetus to break outside the range in either direction. Using the Volume Profile Visible Range (VPVR) tool to measure BTC trading volume by price illustrates this.  Measuring from the beginning of 2022 highlights a “high volume node” (indicating an area of significant price agreement), at the $19,300 level.  Incorporating VPVR with BTC’s Bollinger Bands shows additional areas of high agreement at prices that coincide with bitcoin’s upper and lower bands. Bollinger bands are a technical indicator that measure an asset’s moving average (often the 20-day) and calculates two standard deviations above and below that price.  BTC now appears poised to continue trading in a range between approximately $18,600 and $20,200. A slight bullish divergence appears to be forming as momentum has recently accelerated at a faster pace than price.  Signals to monitor would be a bullish crossing of the 10-day moving average (currently $19,200) above the 50-day moving average ($19,800), but conditions don’t seem ripe for that at the moment.

42413789,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlCF9O,1666386013,Core Scientific Again Raises Bitcoin Mining Hosting Rates,"The world's largest bitcoin miner, Core Scientific (CORZ), raised its rates for hosting other companies' machines to just under 10 cents per kilowatt hour, two people familiar with the matter told CoinDesk.  It's the latest price hike for Core Scientific, which had previously raised its rates by 20%-25% in recent months because of soaring energy costs. With the price of bitcoin stubbornly hanging around in the $20,000 area, the boosted costs make it even more difficult for miners to break even.  Hosting is a service that data centers provide to crypto miners so that customers can store their mining rigs and mine digital assets for a fee without having to build the infrastructure themselves. Core Scientific has both a hosting and mining business, with 22.5 exahash/second (EH/s) of its own and others' computing power in its data centers across the U.S. The company is actually losing money of late on hosting operations, according to its most recent earnings report.  A Core Scientific spokesperson declined to comment on the specifics, but said that ""increased power costs are passed through"" to customers ... While the cost of power has been on the rise, we do expect power costs to decline again in the future, which would be reflected in our future rates.""  ""All units outside of the [Bitmain Antminer] S19 XP [go] into negative gross margin territory,"" at above 9 cents per kilowatt hour, said Ethan Vera, chief operating officer at mining services firm Luxor Technologies. ""If hashprice [the value of 1 terahash/second of computing power per day] trends down we expect it to hit some resistance points as the high-cost operators and low-efficiency miners turn off,"" he added.  Analyst Chris Brendler at investment bank DA Davidson downgraded CORZ from buy to neutral in a note earlier today, saying it was a tough decision given it is the ""best-in-class in many ways."" However. the miner is at a ""significantly more stressed liquidity position than expected"" and its hosting business is under stress due to unhedged power and ""uneconomic hosting contracts,"" Brendler wrote.

42413774,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlCEvM,1666384237,Pension Fund-Backed Parataxis Digital Yield Fund Targets $500M in Assets in 2023,"Multi-strategy crypto investment firm Parataxis Capital expects to triple the assets under management for its $35.6 million digital yield fund by the end of the year, with a further ambitious target of $500 million by the end of 2023, co-founder and CEO Edward Chin told CoinDesk in an interview. Chin said the target is based on conversations with the firm’s allocators, who help institutions decide where to invest money.  Parataxis, which currently has about $116 million in assets under management, primarily focuses on institutional investors such as banks, family offices and pension endowments. The market-neutral Parataxis Digital Yield Fund made headlines in August when Fairfax County, Virginia’s, $6.8 billion pension fund, the Fairfax County Retirement Systems, said it would invest $35 million in the yield farming fund. Fairfax, one of the first U.S. pensions to invest in crypto, made a two-part bet on yield farming, a term that refers to any effort to generate the most returns possible on crypto assets through a variety of methods.  Read more: What Is Yield Farming? The Rocket Fuel of DeFi, Explained  Parataxis also manages the multi-strategy Absolute Return Fund, which adjusts its strategy according to the current market cycle. The fund had $69.5 million in assets as of the most recent filing in April. And the $9.6 million Special Opportunities Fund focuses on what the firm calls liquid venture capital, making seed-stage investments in “promising protocols and token-based technologies,” said Chin.  Parataxis was founded three years ago by Chin and Thejas Nalval, who serves as chief investment officer at the firm. Parataxis stands out in the crypto investment space as a disabled veteran-owned small business, according to Chin, who served in the U.S. Army. He previously worked as an investment banker at digital asset banks Galaxy Digital and the Element Group and spent years in traditional finance, including Credit Suisse. Nalval was previously a portfolio manager with crypto hedge fund LedgerPrime and met Chin at Element Group. He spent eight years at Goldman Sachs, most recently as a trader in the macro trading group.  “We have a good sense for how [institutional] allocators are looking at the space,” explained Chin. “We try to understand what’s important to our prospective limited partner base and try to develop products and investment strategies that would appeal to them versus creating something and hoping the market would get there.""",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/10/21/pension-backed-parataxis-digital-yield-fund-targets-500m-in-assets-in-2023,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1e0051756d2889e3ca565143e4490bb45b8e646b-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A Maker Improvement Proposal submitted by Coinbase in September laid out how a chunk of USDC could be moved to Coinbase Prime for custody and rewards. “Coinbase is uniquely situated to offer a USDC Rewards Program to MakerDAO that meets this evaluative criteria,” according to the proposal.  Currently, 88% of the votes are in favor of the proposal, with a final deadline in three days. Lau sees the event as being “very likely” to be accepted by Maker.  Coinbase is one of the co-issuers of USDC, along with Circle. The transfer between Coinbase and MakerDAO is part of Maker’s ongoing effort to allocate about $4 billion in USDC from its treasury to institutional investors in order to diversify its balance sheet and earn some yield.  Earlier in October, Maker invested $500 million in U.S. treasuries and corporate bonds.  Lau wrote that the added USDC on Coinbase Prime would help the company gain assets and aid Coinbase’s ability to conduct similar proposals, while also potentially growing the total addressable market of USDC and boosting its revenue share. Oppenheimer rates Coinbase’s stock with an outperform and $107 price target. Shares were trading around $65.45 apiece in Friday’s session.  Coinbase said this week it would waive commission fees for USDC sales and purchases made in any fiat currency in a push to promote the wider global adoption of its stablecoin.  Analysts from JPMorgan recently estimated that Coinbase’s joint venture with USDC issuer Circle alone could contribute about $700 million of incremental revenue for the company next year.

42393882,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brbTBR,1666379121,Bitcoin Continues to Ride Area of Support; Volatility Still Low,"Not much has changed for bitcoin (BTC) in the most recent seven days, or the most recent three months for that matter. BTC prices remain range-bound and, at just south of $20,000, is trading almost identically to its June price level.  One of the more interesting themes for bitcoin in 2022 has been the lack of volatility in overall BTC daily price movement.  The price is down approximately 3% for October, having opened the month at $19,400 compared with its current $19,100.  BTC appears to be firmly entrenched along a line of support, with little impetus to break outside the range in either direction. Using the Volume Profile Visible Range (VPVR) tool to measure BTC trading volume by price illustrates this.  Measuring from the beginning of 2022 highlights a “high volume node” (indicating an area of significant price agreement), at the $19,300 level.  Incorporating VPVR with BTC’s Bollinger Bands shows additional areas of high agreement at prices that coincide with bitcoin’s upper and lower bands. Bollinger bands are a technical indicator that measure an asset’s moving average (often the 20-day) and calculates two standard deviations above and below that price.  BTC now appears poised to continue trading in a range between approximately $18,600 and $20,200. A slight bullish divergence appears to be forming as momentum has recently accelerated at a faster pace than price.  Signals to monitor would be a bullish crossing of the 10-day moving average (currently $19,200) above the 50-day moving average ($19,800), but conditions don’t seem ripe for that at the moment.  On-chain data offers a few rays of hope for BTC holders, but the evidence remains scant.  On the one hand, the BTC Miners’ Position index, calculating the ratio of miner outflows to its one-year moving average, has been decreasing. Declines in the amount of BTC sold by miners can be bullish for BTC prices, as it results in less selling pressure overall.  Meanwhile, the net position change for miners over the last 30 days has been declining, and has been negative since August.  An interpretation of BTC miners’ net position change being negative is that those entities may be selling because of a negative outlook on price. A silver lining is the extent to which the net position change has improved since August, implying a potential shift in sentiment",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/21/bitcoin-continues-to-ride-area-of-support-volatility-still-low,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9c3c5aa37d6e1583db3e7ab22e546bb9be69b2a2-4500x3000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Spot Exchange Depositing Addresses Stay At Very Low Values As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, signs are that another crash similar to Q3 2018 isn&apos;t likely to happen currently. The relevant indicator here is the &apos;spot exchange depositing addresses,&apos; which is a measure of the total number of Bitcoin wallet addresses that are making send transactions to centralized spot exchanges right now. Generally, investors deposit their coins on spot exchanges for selling purposes. Thus, a spike in this metric can be bearish for the price of the crypto as it could be a hint at dumping behavior from a large number of addresses. On the other hand, low values imply not many holders are adding to the selling pressure in the market at the moment.

42413787,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlCF7W,1666378087,Bitcoin Completes Second Full Week Below $20K as Aptos Finds Market Bottom,"Bitcoin notched its 14th consecutive day of trading below $20,000, but was holding remarkably steady despite ongoing turmoil in traditional markets.  Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading at around $19,100, little changed in the past 24 hours. The CoinDesk Market Index was up 0.5%. Ether (ETH) was up 1.4% to $1,310 as of press time.  The historically high-volatility crypto market remained unusually stable this week compared with traditional markets whipsawed by speculation over the Federal Reserve’s plans.  While the Fed is expected to raise interest rates by another 75 basis points (0.75 percentage point) during its next meeting on Nov. 2-3, the CME FedWatch tool currently shows that traders see roughly a 50/50 chance that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will raise rates by just 50 basis points in December. Officials say such a downshift might be warranted to prevent over-tightening.  Traditional markets’ turmoil also came after the political shakeup in the U.K. and an apparent move by the Japanese government to prop up the country’s ailing yen. Data showed that bitcoin’s 30-day price volatility is now almost identical to that of the U.K. currency.  Investors are unpacking what the right strategy is for bitcoin in this market – or even starting to focus on the long-term future, such as the Bitcoin blockchain’s next halving.  “Traditionally stable long-term investments like government bonds have seen prices fluctuating wildly, and overall losing value,"" JB Graftieaux, CEO of crypto exchange Bitstamp, told CoinDesk in an interview. “Investors looking at the opportunity to invest for the long term may well see a lot of value to be had in crypto assets.”  Alexandre Lores, director of blockchain market research at Quantum Economics, said he saw a significant number of institutional players build products in the past bear market cycle. And that might be happening again.  “I see institutional players and big venture capitals are really more able to time the market and buy cheap and sell expensive, so I think those things will trigger a really nice bull market,” Lores said in a phone interview with CoinDesk.  Aptos flop  The debut of FTX- and A16z-backed new layer 1 blockchain Aptos caught the industry's attention this week – mainly because it was such a flop.  Aptos's APT token rose 4.5% to $7.40 on Friday, according to CoinMarketCap.  But the APT price is still well off the $9 where it started trading, as CoinDesk previously reported. Aptos also faced community criticism surrounding the amount of its native APT tokens held by private investors.  “Aptos had a bumpy start,” Adrian Fritz, research associate at 21Shares, told CoinDesk in an email.

42413780,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlCF0y,1666376906,Over $1.8B in Royalties Have Been Paid Out to Ethereum-Based NFT Creators: Galaxy Digital,"More than $1.8 billion in royalties have been paid to creators of Ethereum-based non-fungible token (NFT) collections thus far, according to a report published by crypto firm Galaxy Digital on Friday.  The report also highlighted that within the last year average royalties on OpenSea have increased from 3% to 6%. This is notable, considering OpenSea remains the largest NFT marketplace by trading volume, according to DappRadar.  Galaxy Digital also reported that 10 names hold 27% of the total royalty payment market share. Yuga Labs, the creator of the blue chip Bored Ape Yacht Club collection, has earned the most in royalties, with over $147 million in payouts to date.  According to data from Dune Analytics cited in the report, Nike, which acquired digital collectibles startup RTFKT, made $91.6 million in consolidated NFT royalties in comparison. Other real-world brands including Gucci, Adidas, Nickelodeon, McLaren that have successfully integrated NFTs into their business models have made some money off NFT royalties, though the number is far lower when compared with the creator royalties of top Web3-native entities such as Art Blocks, The Sandbox, Doodles, World of Women and more.  Whether platforms should require resale royalties is an ongoing conversation, as some have moved to allow artists to elect their own royalty allocations. In August, NFT marketplace X2Y2 shifted to an optional royalty payment structure for buyers, and last week leading Solana-based NFT platform Magic Eden did the same, leaving the number of royalty payments up to collectors.  “NFT royalties are a relatively new phenomenon when compared to the age of the NFT space itself,” the report said, noting that legacy brands with NFT collections stand to lose the most from loose royalty structures.  “Apart from individual creators, major brands like Nike, Gucci and Adidas also stand to lose tens of millions of dollars in potential revenue if royalties are no longer enforced. We expect these massive legacy institutions and marquee creators to fight hard to preserve their royalty-driven revenue streams from Ethereum-based NFT collections.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2022/10/21/over-18b-in-royalties-have-been-paid-out-to-ethereum-based-nft-creators-galaxy-digital,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/36012690419e4a597be4937cb19f15ec0b387786-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Many brands have already been launching NFT collections and pursuing Web3 strategies and investments such as buying digital land in the metaverse. The companies betting on Web3 are from various industries, with apparel, drinks or luxury sectors the most represented.  We took a look at the top revenue from NFTs on Ethereum and also included brands that’ve chosen to utilize other blockchains to drive their Web3 growth. Here’s some of the brands already making big waves – and big money in Web3.  Top brands on Ethereum  Using data from a dashboard on Dune Analytics that tracks big brands' NFT revenue, CoinDesk looked at what was driving these brands' success. We combined Budweiser and Bud Light, below, into one that encapsulated most of what AB InBev, the parent company, is doing in Web3.  Nike  Before the more mainstream Web3 push began, Nike was making moves, receiving a patent for “CryptoKicks,” a blockchain-linked sneaker. Nike also ran a blockchain trial with Macy’s and Auburn University’s RFID Lab in March, 2020, to better share product data across the retail supply chain.  But it was in December 2021, when Nike acquired NFT sneaker studio RTFKT Studios, that marked Nike’s major move in Web3. RTFKT is behind the 20,000-piece CloneX NFT collection, with a trading volume of 436 ETH ($584,240) as of this writing. In February 2022, RTFKT gave commercial rights to CloneX NFT holders, allowing them to create derivative projects, mint fan art and make and sell merchandise featuring their avatars.  Continuing its Web3 push well into the bear market, in April 2022, Nike launched a metaverse sneaker line called RTFKT x Nike Dunk Genesis CryptoKicks. And in November 2022, the company announced its .SWOOSH platform that will soon allow community members to create and trade digital collectibles.

It launched on UNXD, a luxury marketplace on the Polygon network, where the two-day bidding for the collection fetched approximately $5.65 million. “The Doge Crown” NFT sold for the highest amount – 423.5 ETH, or around $1.3 million at the time.  Since the successful launch, D&G and UNXD have teamed up to create the DGFamily, an NFT community “for digital luxury and culture.”  Tiffany & Co.  Considered one of the most classic luxury brands, Tiffany entered the Web3 world with what, relatively speaking, is one of the most classic NFT projects, CryptoPunks.  In August 2022, Tiffany unveiled 250 digital necklaces for 30 ETH each (about $50,000 at that time) – available exclusively to the holders of CryptoPunk NFTs. These diamond-encrusted pendant NFTs allowed holders to redeem them for physical necklaces. One user flipped a Tiffany CryptoPunk necklace for almost double the price, 55 ETH, which remains the highest sale so far.  Gucci  Italian luxury fashion brand Gucci has a multi-faceted Web3 strategy, from NFTs to metaverse land to investing in a DAO and allowing cryptocurrency payments.  In the realm of NFTs, Gucci turned its Aria fashion collection into an NFT video In May 2021, which sold for $25,000 at auction house Christie’s Proof of Sovereignty sale. It followed with the launch of 1,000 NFTs in collaboration with the toy brand Superplastic in February, 2022. Each NFT, which sold for 1.5 ETH, or approximately $2,623 at the time, can be redeemed for a ceramic sculpture handmade in Italy and co-designed by Gucci.  The company also bet on the future of the metaverse around the same time as the Superplastic collaboration, buying an undisclosed amount of virtual land on The Sandbox to create themed experiences in its digital space dubbed Gucci Vault.  Gucci also bought $25,000 worth of RARE tokens in June 2022 to join the SuperRareDAO and launch a digital “Vault Art Space.”  Finally, some Gucci stores in the U.S. started accepting several cryptocurrencies including bitcoin and dogecoin as of May 2022. Ass of August 2022, that also includes apeCoin.  Adidas  Adidas started putting some stakes in Web3 in November 2021. The brand acquired land in The Sandbox, though how it got the land remains unclear: The company either paid for it off-chain or was simply gifted them. In the same month, it also partnered with Coinbase, though it gave no details as to why and as of writing, no further information has been provided.  Then came a big splash. In December 2021, Adidas made a whopping $23.4 million in one afternoon with the debut of its “Into the Metaverse” NFT drop in collaboration with the Bored Ape Yacht Club, PUNKS Comic NFT creator Pixel Vault and private NFT collector gmoney.  In January 2022, Adidas and Prada launched an NFT project called the “adidas for Prada re-source” on the Polygon network, which allows fans to contribute with their own designs. As of writing, it has made 474 ETH (or about $616,000) in trading volume.  Time  Time Inc., the publisher of more than 90 magazines, has had its feet dipped in the cryptocurrency world for quite a while now. It started accepting bitcoin for select properties in December 2014.  In the latest bull market, Time released 3 NFTs of its red-bordered magazine covers, selling for $446,000 ETH.  The company also partnered with artist collective FOTO and took in 12-year-old NFT creator Nyla Hayes as its first artist in residence, to help propel their careers and develop a collection for Time’s Build a Better Future drop.  AB InBev: Budweiser and Bud Light  The world’s largest brewing company, AB InBev has gone big with two of its American-born brands, Budweiser and Bud Light.  Budweiser has flirted with crypto for years. In May 2014, Budweiser teamed up with Coinbase on a bitcoin payments initiative for concert goers. In June 2019, Budweiser invested an undisclosed amount in blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) startup BanQ to assist unbanked workers.  See Also: Anheuser-Busch InBev Taps Vaynerchuk to Lead Beer Giant's 'Long-Term' NFT Play  The company’s strategy took a Web3 turn in August 2021, when Budweiser bought the beer.eth domain for 30 ETH ($95,000 at the time) and a rocket NFT for 8 ETH ($25,00 at the time).  In November 2021, Budweiser released its first set of NFTs, Budverse Cans: Heritage Edition, which consists of 1,936 NFTs, a reference to the year the company released beer in cans. In January 2022, Budweiser partnered with 22 emerging artists and dropped a collection of 11,00 NFTs, with a mint price of $499 per NFT.  In February 2022, Bud Light took things to IRL: It aired a Super Bowl commercial featuring Nouns NFT. Later in that month, it released 2,000 NFTs in connection with its new beer brand, N3XT. Each NFT sold for $399, and each NFT holder could claim a pair of Nouns-inspired glasses.  In June 2022, Stella, and later Budweiser, partnered with Ethereum-based NFT horse racing game Zed Run to release in-game horse skins based on its Clydesdale mascots, among other things.  The Australian Open  In April 2022, tennis tournament the Australian Open (AO) released a collection of 6,776 AO Art Ball NFTs in partnership with Web3 studio Run it Wild. At the same time, AO launched an immersive journey through Melbourne park within Decentraland's metaverse, which included access to behind-the-scenes footage and play-to-earn daily quests to win NFTs.  Interestingly, the NFTs are not just a static art. Each ball tracks match metadata and was linked to a 19 cm x 19 cm section on a tennis court. A winning shot that lands on any section of the court is linked to an owner’s NFT. If one of the 11 championship points landed on the plot, the owner of the connected NFT was rewarded with a physical ball used in the game, encased in a custom handcrafted case. Each ball sold for around 0.07 ETH (about $90 at the time).  Lacoste  Finally, French fashion brand Lacoste ventured into Web3 with the launch of its NFT collection in June 2022. The 11,212-piece NFT collection is a reference to its polo shirt called L1212. Before its foray into a true Web3 venture, Lacoste also worked with Minecraft to feature its clothing line in the popular world-building game, which is often talked about as part of the metaverse with similar open-world games like RoBlox.  Top brands on other blockchains  The NBA  The National Basketball Association’s partnership with Dapper Labs to launch NBA Top Shot in 2020 is a success story in the NFT collectibles space. Dapper Labs shared with CoinDesk that since the launch, the secondary sales have netted over $1 billion in sales through over 22 million transactions. Of course, not all of that money goes to the NBA, but the 5% fee users pay is split between Dapper and the NBA so that’s a cool $50 million between them.  In September 2022, the NBA announced an additional partnership with Sorare as its official fantasy partner, and has also filed for NFT trademarks as well as registering two .eth domains – it’s clear the NBA’s game plans for Web3 are growing.  The NFL  The National Football League is also worth noting for working with Dapper Labs to launch NFL All Day, another NFT collectibles marketplace. While the figures shared with CoinDesk are not as exceptional as for NBA Top Shot, $65 million in secondary sales is still a significant number.  The NFL has also partnered with Polygon to send “Virtual Commemorative Tickets” as NFTs to Ticketmaster wallets, and gave out unique NFTs to every fan at Super Bowl LVI.  In May 2022, the NFL announced a partnership with Mythical Games to launch a play-to-earn game in 2023, which will make the NFL the first American league to kick off a play-to-earn venture.",POSITIVE,ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MATIC | TRADING,Ekin Genç,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/top-brands-in-web3-nfts-and-the-metaverse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bf2545a95818f00287448b57b302100c71ef6c51-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394491,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bw95ZF,1666372366,New NFT Marketplace Blur Is Courting Professional JPEG Traders With an Airdrop and No Trading Fees,"A buzzy new non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace has entered the arena, offering zero trading fees and an airdrop of its native token to JPEG collectors who have kept trading despite the bear market.  Blur, an Ethereum-based platform, launched a beta version on Wednesday with over $14 million of backing from venture-capital giant Paradigm, NFT-native investment fund 6529, digital art collector Cozomo Medici and others.  The platform is targeting “professional” NFT traders with features like “floor sweeping” across multiple marketplaces, reveal “sniping” and portfolio analytics tools, along with a future airdrop of its BLUR token to anyone who has traded Ethereum-based NFTs in the last six months.  To claim the airdrop, users must list one of their NFTs on the marketplace, which grants them access to “care packages” that can be redeemed for tokens in the future.  “Care packages can be opened for BLUR tokens when we launch our token and protocol governance in January,” the company said in an announcement. “This is just our first step towards making Blur a marketplace that the entire NFT community can own and profit from.”  While the marketplace follows the recent trend of optional royalties in a bid to attract users, it has also created a rewards program that incentivizes users to pay royalties in exchange for more BLUR tokens.  The royalty debate has been the center of attention in the NFT industry the past few weeks, ignited most recently by Magic Eden, the top marketplace on the Solana blockchain, moving to a royalty-optional model.

42394185,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvY3fD,1666371897,Hardliners Stymie Online Identity Innovation,"I fear I’m going to upset a few people with this column.  That’s because I’m going after both sides in the divisive debate over identity in crypto and finance: blinkered monetary regulators on the one hand and blind crypto idealists on the other. In their own way, each is obstructing progress on sensible cryptographic identity systems, the kind that would give us solid online privacy while also enabling the secure, sustainable expansion of digital innovation in the public interest.  The type of regulator I’m targeting is unable to think outside the business-as-usual box of bureaucracy. This person resorts to knee-jerk demands that everyone – be they person, company or software platform – submit to invasive demands to report identity and transactions at every step of their financial lives. They don’t seem to care that this effectively restricts financial participation for many – for the poor, especially, but also for leaders of vaguely undesirable but entirely legal businesses such as cryptocurrency service providers. Nor do they worry they are facilitating the unholy bargain between the state and banks that we discussed last week.  The crypto idealists are trapped by a mix of narrow self interest, utopianism and bone-headed intransigence. They treat any workable, consumer-friendly self-sovereign identity system as a slippery slope to a totalitarian hellhole. In stirring up outrage among their followers, they make it hard for practical-minded developers to deploy such tools in real-world settings and confirm the regulatory community’s ill-informed biases that crypto is dominated by anarchists and criminals. The result: the perpetuation of a stupid incumbent system and a cohort of policymakers encouraged to build ever more invasive surveillance systems into the digital money systems of the future.  I was led to this conclusion by three conversations on the sidelines of CoinDesk’s I.D.E.A.S. summit in New York this week.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  ‘Zelle on turds’  The first conversation was one Sheila Warren and I had for our “Money Reimagined” podcast with Greg Kidd, a director at GlobaliD and the CEO of investment firm Hard Yaka. A former Federal Reserve analyst, Kidd laid out how far self-sovereign credential management has come under the World Wide Web Consortium’s (WC3) decentralized identifier (DID) standard, with Zero-Knowledge proofs and other cryptographic tools allowing people to limit and control access to their personal data and to use it to sign into different applications.  Kidd discussed some unique crypto applications in the finance sector, all of which will remain beholden, at least for now, to regulators’ requirements for know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) identity compliance.  One idea: A regulated financial institution could confirm with mathematical proof that the holder of an address sending or receiving cryptocurrency had at some point been verified by a trusted source for KYC purposes without needing to know the address holder’s name or other identifying information. The proof would be required only at the on- and off-ramps between on-chain crypto world and the financial system – i.e., when a cryptocurrency is being exchanged for fiat currency – to keep on-chain crypto transactions frictionless. Meanwhile, we could have system-wide, on-chain data analyses to meet AML needs, identifying nodes engaged in patterns of illicit activity, all without invasive identity requirements.  It was an enlightening look at what’s possible to avoid centralized entities building up vulnerable “honeypots” of personal data.  Yet, there’s currently little traction for such ideas among people in a position to mandate this new compliance model. Kidd said that “not even 1%” of banks are exploring such applications. And many officials working on central bank digital currencies seem insistent on a KYC approach that would allow them to narrowly restrict CBDCs to citizens of their countries – a vision for the future of money that he described as “Zelle on turds.”  Emotionally charged overreactions  Then I heard about the crypto community’s obstructionist role.  This came in a meeting with David Sneider of Lit Protocol, who presented at I.D.E.A.S. and was featured in a CoinDesk profile by Sage Young.  After CoinDesk tweeted a quote from Sneider’s presentation about how people will soon be able to use the WC3’s new WebAuthn standard to enable on-device facial recognition technology as a multifactor authentication system in recovering a private crypto key – replacing the current seed phrase norm – the replies from many in Crypto Twitter were brutal.  “What a [crappy] idea. You should be embarrassed,” wrote @BTCSteve.  “Literally a terrible idea. Your money should be as anonymous as possible, not accessible with a deepfake,” wrote former baseball pitcher-turned-crypto enthusiast C.J. Wilson.  These knee-jerk reactions were no doubt founded on understandable concerns about surveillance and hacking risks associated with centralized databases of biometric information. But in this case they seemed to totally miss the point.  Read more: Lit Protocol: Public Key Infrastructure for a Decentralized World  As Sneider explained, the mechanism behind WebAuthn simply extends the widely accepted and highly secure facial recognition model found in most new smartphones, which relies on unique cryptographic tokens embedded into the device to which no third party can gain access. The method will allow you to authorize the similarly localized controls in other devices you own to activate access to a third device – such as replacement for a lost phone or hard wallet. This way you can activate a crypto key that’s founded on highly secure, decentralized multiparty computation. There is no centralized control of biometrics involved at all.  The overreaction exposed how emotionally charged the conversation around identity is on crypto social media. This makes it difficult for developers to advance powerful ideas that could bring secure, self-custody crypto capabilities to a mass user base.  Ulterior motive?  In the Lit Protocol case, the Twitter reaction seemed based on a misunderstanding. But an institutional investor who has followed crypto for a long time offered a more cynical explanation for why some in the community try to shut down discussion around innovative identity solutions. “It’s because they don’t want their wash trades exposed,” said this I.D.E.A.S. attendee, who asked not to be named.  Wash trading refers to the practice of exchanging an asset between two accounts controlled by the same person to elevate the price for that asset. Anonymity has made this especially problematic in crypto markets. My source’s suggestion was that anything that either identifies traders, or simply shows that two addresses are controlled by the same investor, would make the practice harder to carry out and remove a source of false support for prices. So powerful players with a stake in keeping prices high will push back on all and any identity solutions.  Watch: Wash Trading: How to Protect Yourself  There’s no way of verifying this thesis. But given the widespread price pumping and the self-interested practices that enriched certain players during last year’s crypto bubble, it feels believable. Certainly, it’s a more valid explanation for the community’s resistance to identity technology than the debunked myth that cryptocurrencies are mostly used by criminals for money laundering.  The bottom line  The crypto community must understand there is no path to mass adoption without self-sovereign identity, just as the regulator community needs to learn how cryptography can solve security risks without breaching privacy.

Appearing before students at Istanbul University during the Blockchain Istanbul Programme organized by his Justice and Development Party (AKP), Erdoğan said he wants to see Turkey be a producer, not a consumer, in the digital assets world, according to a report by Alp Börü for CoinDesk Turkey.  Despite Turkey being a fast-growing crypto market, the Erdoğan administration is not known to be friendly towards the industry. In 2021, the government banned the use of crypto for payments. Later in the year, Erdoğan made headlines over his plans to urgently send a restrictive crypto bill to the country’s parliament, but not much has since been heard of the legislation. The crypto market remains largely unregulated in the country.  His remarks seem to indicate an openness to at least some aspects of cryptocurrencies. He said Friday that Turkey seeks to establish its own virtual world, or metaverse. And earlier this year, the president attended a forum organized by AKP in the metaverse.  “I advise our young people to take part in the change of innovations such as blockchain technology and turn to larger and more fertile channels instead of turning to crypto money gambling that has no basis,” Erdoğan said.  Blockchain-based decentralized ledgers for immutable record-keeping has the “potential to radically change existing supply chains,” he said, also noting the impact blockchain technology could have on protecting intellectual property.  On the regulatory front, the president said that the country’s central bank is carrying out studies on cryptocurrencies.  “Our other ministries also follow this technology closely in their own areas of responsibility,"" he said.

The digital asset which reached an all-time high of $146 back in November of 2021 is not trading just below $15. This has led to a decline in confidence in the digital asset. However, protocols such as Avalanche have shown over time that they can sometimes be underestimated and the latest announcement from the project proves this. Avalanche Keeps Building Normally, during the bull market when there is decreased participation in the space, a lot of protocols tend to not build as much as they usually would.

42394209,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvY35J,1666370934,"In Craig Wright Verdict, Reality Prevails","It has been a bad month for bulls**t artists.  Early Thursday, a Norwegian court ruled in favor of Hodlonaut, aka Magnus Granath, in connection with Craig Wright’s claims to be pseudonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto. A judge ruled, in part, “that Granath had sufficient factual grounds to claim that Craig Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto in March 2019.”  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The verdict is expected to help Granath fight off parallel defamation allegations in the U.K., where Wright is already on a yearslong losing streak in the assorted nuisance lawsuits through which he has doubled down on his unsupported claims to be Satoshi.  The ruling caps off an even broader string of recent losses for bloviators, fabulists and frauds of various stripes.  Far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was ordered to pay $965 million in damages to victims’ families early this month, after repeatedly claiming the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting didn’t actually happen. Earlier this week, Do Kwon, a man who managed to trick both the public and himself into thinking he was a genius, gave an embarrassingly evasive interview while on the run from international law enforcement.  Even Elon Musk, intermittently the richest man in the world, has given up attempts to escape a trap he singlehandedly built for himself. He recently agreed to buy Twitter at an inflated valuation rather than risk more revelations of exactly what designer drugs do to your brain.  See also: Craig Wright's Abnormal Psychology | Opinion  It’s almost enough to give a cynic some hope in our supposedly post-truth age.  But the fascination of deception is hard to turn away from. With the case of Granath vs. Wright falling in favor of the truth, it leaves one contemplating even deeper questions. Such as: Why exactly is Craig Wright claiming to be Satoshi if he has no evidence?  Bitcoin Faketoshi’s Vision  One clue came in early October in the form of a new promotional video from Wright’s Bitcoin SV camp, describing a new “digital asset recovery” system for the irrelevant Bitcoin fork that claims to represent “Satoshi’s Vision.” The system would offer courts direct influence over BSV operations, including the ability to blacklist criminal funds and, even more radically, circumvent private keys to reassign ownership of tokens.  This lunatic proposal provides some further illumination of Craig Wright’s bizarre insistence in recent years that blockchain tokens can be moved by court order. This is true in the very limited sense that law enforcement can compel suspects or convicts to hand over their private keys, but Wright has insisted on the much broader and sillier claim that a court order can move tokens entirely without private keys. This is technically impossible on Bitcoin and any other cryptocurrency system – in fact, that’s kind of the point.  Reading between the lines, the asset recovery proposal suggests the BSV coalition’s long game is to leverage Wright’s claims to be Satoshi to somehow gain control of more than 1.1 million bitcoin (BTC) that were mined by Satoshi early on, and have remained untouched since Satoshi’s disappearance.  If that’s their goal, they are still far away from it. The issue is not whether keys alone confer legal ownership – ultimately, they don’t – but whether tokens can be moved or spent without them. Ultimately, they can’t.  Wright and Calvin Ayre’s effective control of the low-value BSV blockchain means they can implement whatever ludicrous notary-censorship subroutine they want. But even if they manage to trick some U.S. district judge into thinking that this is how blockchains are supposed to work, the Satoshi BTC keys are not going to simply appear out of thin air.  The end of an error  With the Norway judgment, it seems reasonable that Craig Wright’s pathetic tale is nearing its last days of even marginal relevance. Anyone who still believes his unsupported claims at this point deserves what they get, as far as I’m concerned.  Yet, there is one tantalizing question that still haunts me: to quote the great Aretha Franklin, Who’s zoomin’ who? Specifically, are Craig Wright and allies like Calvin Ayre and Jimmy Nguyen all in on this together? Or is Wright alone defrauding his nominal allies as well as the public?  See also: Why Are We Still Debating Whether Craig Wright Is Satoshi? | Opinion  The arcana are definitely not worth most people’s time and energy to sort out, but there is reason to believe Wright saw Ayre as a potential financial savior after the Australian Tax Office uncovered one of Wright’s earlier frauds and levied a big fine in 2015 – just as his claims to be Satoshi became public.  It’s easy to imagine Wright convincing Ayre that he’s really Satoshi, and that there was money to be made from it. It’s particularly easy to imagine because Calvin Ayre does not seem like a very smart man.  It is obviously unacceptable that Craig Wright has managed to waste so much of everyone’s time, energy and money with his little charade. But there may be some cold comfort in the idea that his biggest victim is a callow billionaire who let greed override his (apparently limited) critical faculties.",POSITIVE,BTC | BSV,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | REGULATION | BSV,David Z.

The Polkadot ecosystem is a network of blockchains running in parallel - known as 'parachains' - with a central relay chain which handles the governance of the system of blockchains. Polkadot was designed by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood as a smarter approach to blockchain scaling, interoperability and tokenomics and has consistently been within the top ten so-called layer 1 blockchains.  In a statement shared with CoinDesk, Wood said he will focus on making Polkadot ""more relevant to large swathes of the population"" in his new role as Chief Architect.

42394180,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvY3FZ,1666367039,Hodling Shielded Assets Is the Best Way to Maintain Privacy,"Many people believe you can gain privacy by switching in and out of a privacy coin. They do this because they want to anonymize funds received from a friend or transferred in from an exchange.  The truth is, this really doesn’t work. When transacting through privacy coins on transparent blockchains, you’re leaking a large amount of data about yourself and you’re likely creating patterns between your transactions that make you easier to track.  Ian Sagstetter is the communications and community manager at Electric Coin Company, the creator of Zcash. He is also the founder of ZecHub, an education channel focused on the Zcash protocol.  Holding funds in a shielded asset, for an extended period, gives you a stronger anonymity set and provides more security when you need to perform private transactions.  Privacy coins are not mixers, and treating them as such will weaken your privacy set and will likely make you easier to trace.  Transparency keeps decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols honest and provides an easy path for auditability, and many users have reasons for wanting their transactions and holdings to be public.  But there are also instances where users need financial privacy. Crypto has been pretty bad at providing it, and the protocols that do provide privacy have been cast into a sub-category that delegitimizes their utility.  Pass-throughs result in maximum data leakage  User-privacy is protected by leaking the least amount of data possible. Shielding funds, through monetary protocols with Zero-Knowledge proofs, enables users to store value and transact with other users with higher privacy sets when compared to transparent protocols like Bitcoin.  The cryptography ensures that transaction data is encrypted, but can still be verified by the network. When a user moves funds into one of these protocols they gain a stronger level of financial privacy.  See also: What the Tornado Cash Sanction Means for Privacy Coins  However, every time a user transacts, even when using a privacy-preserving payment protocol, they leak data about themselves. This is especially true if you use the protocol as a pass-through between addresses or counterparties.  This is a popular technique users deploy to obscure funds from their original source. People mainly use this technique to make sure their main wallet address is not connected to their public address. For example, when a big DeFi user needs to get some ether (ETH) to their wallet associated with their Ethereum Name Service (ENS) address, they might use a privacy tool as a pass-through to ensure that these addresses are never linked together.  The issue with this practice is that chain surveillance companies could pretty easily trace this transaction. Let’s say you move 1 ETH in and out of a Zcash wallet. A surveillance company could easily break down all transactions worth 1 ETH between the Zcash and Ethereum blockchains during a given period of time. Your transaction would likely appear in this search, associating your Ethereum address as a part of this user group.  If someone does this enough times, they’re consistently leaking data about themselves and making it easier for the surveillance companies to determine their identity.  Hodling is the best way to ensure privacy  Arguably the best way to gain privacy in crypto is to hold funds in a shielded asset. The longer you keep funds at rest, the stronger your anonymity set becomes.  This actually makes maintaining privacy relatively easy. Have a stash in a privacy-preserving crypto, add small amounts to it as desired, hold the stash to strengthen your privacy set and use it for payments when needed.  A potential problem with this could be when users only privatize funds to make a private transaction. See, private payments have long been touted as the killer use case for cryptocurrencies like zcash (ZEC) and monero (XMR). Need to send some money privately? Swap some bitcoin for a privacy coin and send the transaction.  See also: The Coming Privacy Wars | Opinion  But this action doesn’t give users the level of privacy they think it might. Imagine this scenario:You want to make a donation to an activist organization, but you don’t want the donation to be linked back to your identity because of safety concerns. The only permissionless asset you hold is bitcoin (BTC), and because you bought it through an exchange the transparent asset is tied to your identity.  You decide that you want to swap your BTC for ZEC, a shielded asset. You make the swap and then immediately send the donation. The recipient receives the donation and exchanges it for fiat the next day.  When a chain surveillance company is tasked with finding identities for people who sent donations via shielded assets to this organization, the ones who held their funds in the shielded asset for the least amount of time are the easiest to determine. Because the shielding of the BTC and the deshielding of ZEC happened within a short period of time, it’s not out of the realm of possibility that your identity could be tied to the activist organization’s exchange of ZEC to fiat.  So, instead of buying a shielded asset for one-off use cases, it’s better to store small amounts of value in a shielded asset consistently over time. By not creating irregular accumulation patterns and gaining a stronger anonymity set through holding, your future payments will be more private.  Think of shielded assets like cash  Shielded assets in the crypto space need to be compared to cash. As recently as 10 years ago if people needed to make a private payment they would use cash instead of Paypal.  If you needed to use cash, would you go to the ATM (where there’s likely surveillance cameras) and take out exactly what you need every time you need to spend something? Probably not.  The best thing to do for personal security would have been to take out a small amount of cash every week or two and hold it somewhere safe. By doing this you’d have a stash of liquid cash with a strong privacy set available when you needed to spend it.  Something we think a lot about in the Zcash ecosystem is the need for fungible, private cash in the crypto economy. Cryptocurrencies can provide permissionless financial access to those who may have previously gone without, but without a private cash-like asset, the ecosystem might not achieve the censorship-resistant qualities it hopes for.  By making assets like ZEC more accessible and available in decentralized financial markets, we're providing users an opportunity to gain financial privacy, should that be something they want to do.  This also ensures that decentralized applications are providing an avenue to truly permissionless usage, as privacy is needed for an asset to be completely permissionless and censorship-resistant.  The crypto economy falls short without privacy  In the future economy, we need to provide infrastructure and access to shielded assets to those who want and need financial privacy. Without this access, systems might be decentralized, but they certainly won’t be entirely permissionless.  Giving users the ability to store value in shielded assets will provide them more autonomy, freedom, and security. It also strengthens crypto’s censorship-resistant attributes.  Builders of decentralized protocols need to keep financial access to digital cash in mind when building out decentralized financial systems. The cryptoeconomy won’t survive without it.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH | ZEC | ENS,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | ZEC | ENS,Ian Sagstetter,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/10/21/hodling-shielded-assets-is-the-best-way-to-maintain-privacy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fae056b1519d87ecb6612be135d0e1fb4bf9ed8d-2048x1376.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Other cryptocurrencies in the crypto top 10 by market cap follow a similar trend except for Cardano and Solana. These cryptocurrencies are recording heavy losses across the board. Bitcoin Price Takes Downside Liquidity Last week, the Bitcoin price negatively reacted to the September Consumer Price Index (CPI) print published by the U.S. government. This metric is one of the benchmarks for inflation, and its September print hinted at higher levels. In turn, the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) will tighten the monetary conditions of global markets. This policy will continue to cap any bullish momentum for Bitcoin and risk-on assets, including those in legacy markets. This reaction to higher inflation, and a hawkish Fed, led the Bitcoin price to revisit its yearly lows near $17,600 as the September CPI print was published.

42394027,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69buO3Fr,1666362420,"Some, Not All, Crypto Token Screenings Will Be Scrapped, Japan’s JVCEA Official Says","Japan’s accredited self-regulatory body for the crypto industry is simplifying a complicated screening process that digital tokens must undergo before being listed on local exchanges.  These rules will come into effect in December and have been approved by Japan’s top financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency.  But a Bloomberg report saying the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA) is trying to remove all coin screenings by 2024 is not entirely accurate, according to the body’s Vice Chair Genki Oda.  “This does not mean that the pre-screening process will be completely eliminated. JVCEA will continue to perform certain checks,” Oda said.  While Japan’s government is looking to establish strict anti-money laundering regulations for the crypto industry in line with global standards, it has also been trying to make life easier for startups in the country, which are currently burdened by heavy corporate taxes and complicated token listing requirements.  All crypto tokens are vetted by the JVCEA before they are approved for listing on local trading platforms. Currently, unless a token is already listed on at least three exchanges, it has to go through a lengthy pre-screening process to be allowed on additional exchanges.  The stringent requirement is limiting the number of tokens available for trading on Japanese exchanges, prompting local investors to turn to exchanges outside of Japan like Bybit and Binance in search of more choice, Oda said.  With the JVCEA’s new rules, if the asset is already listed on one exchange, other exchanges do not need to go through a pre-screening process to list the same asset.  “It is assumed each crypto asset exchange will conduct its own review,” Oda said in an interview with CoinDesk. The JVCEA will still make sure that each company conducts thorough reviews.  The rules, which were already shared with the crypto exchanges that make up the self-regulatory body, do not apply to assets that have been listed on foreign exchanges but not on exchanges in Japan. The loose screening requirements also don’t apply to project fundraises through initial coin offerings (ICO) and initial exchange offerings (IEO) as well as crypto assets like stablecoins.  “Many of the 31 exchanges are positive about this improvement,” Oda said, referring to JVCEA members.  Some members think the changes don’t go far enough, and have called for the rules to include assets listed on foreign exchanges.  “The entire Japanese crypto market will be damaged in the event that inappropriate crypto assets are [listed],” Oda said. “We have decided to exclude them from the scope.”  Backlog  A year ago, crypto asset screenings in Japan were messy. More than 80 crypto assets were stuck in a backlog awaiting review, and only up to five of them were reviewed each month. Even listing bitcoin or ether on an exchange could take at least a month.  The JVCEA has cleared the backlog of assets that could have been stuck in a queue for two years. Currently less than 10 assets are in need of vetting, Oda said, adding that the association has five to eight staff members dedicated to reviewing assets. On average, they can review five to 10 new crypto assets per month, he said.  Trouble with regulators  Earlier this year, reports suggested there was a rift between Japan’s financial watchdog, the FSA, and the JVCEA. Financial Times reported that the FSA had issued warnings to the association and was displeased with its management. JVCEA staff had formed a union in response to workplace harassment from a member of management.  The manager in question has since resigned, Oda said. He told CoinDesk that the JVCEA and FSA have resolved management issues and have a “direct communication path.”  CoinDesk has reached out to the FSA for comment.  Oda said the JVCEA was next turning to clarifying accounting standards for crypto assets. JVCEA is preparing for discussions on how to conduct audits with the financial regulator and accounting firms.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TOKEN SALE | TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,Lavender Au,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/10/21/some-not-all-crypto-token-screenings-will-be-scrapped-japans-jvcea-official-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/888817eba94afbc8f4e53a081d3f5586f50a8f5c-910x682.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42388846,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRTxlD,1666361256,"Smart Money Eyes Market-Neutral Trades as ADA, AXS See Unusually Low Funding Rates","While you continue to fret over the broader market lull, remember there are always opportunities out there and they often present themselves in different ways.  For instance, holding a short position (a bearish bet) in the perpetual futures market tied to Cardano's ADA and play-to-earn giant Axie Infinity's AXS token has become unusually costly, creating a window of opportunity for market-neutral traders to make attractive returns, according to Markus Thielen, head of research at strategy at Matrixport, a crypto services provider with $10 billion in assets under management.  In a note sent to clients early Friday, Thielen said ADA's annualized funding rate, or the cost of keeping long (bullish)/short (bearish) positions open, has dropped to an average of -14% across major exchanges – a rare occurrence in the past eight months. As a result, traders can purchase ADA perpetual contracts and simultaneously sell ADA tokens in the spot market to safely pocket the funding rate.  The funding rate is charged every eight hours. A negative rate, as in ADA's case, means positioning is skewed bearish and short sellers are paying longs to keep short positions open.  So, suppose an entity opens a long position in the ADA perpetual futures market right now. In that case, it will receive an annualized funding rate of 14% – an attractive yield, considering the U.S. 10-year Treasury note yields just over 4%.  The long trade, however, is unhedged. If ADA's price tanks, the resulting loss could be more significant than the 14% yield generated from the funding rate. The entity can eliminate the risk by selling ADA tokens in the spot market, thereby creating a market-neutral position.  ""Long ADA Perp at -14% to -23% discount vs. Short Cardano's ADA spot Tokens,"" Thielen recommended in a client note.  ""You can currently make 14% profit by purchasing perpetual future, borrowing the ADA tokens from a firm like Matrixport, and selling those. If and when the spot price and perpetual futures converge, you should make a 14% profit return,"" Thielen told CoinDesk.  Note that the rate at which tokens are borrowed needs to be lower than the funding yield, or else the market-neutral strategy will yield a loss.  ADA traded at 35 cents at press time, down 2% on the day. The token has lost over 20% since Cardano implemented the Vasil hard fork on Sep 26, seeking to boost security, scalability and transaction speeds.  AXS funding rate drops to -56%  The bear grip around AXS has strengthened, pushing the funding rate to a whopping -56%, as 10 million tokens belonging to insiders and early investors will be released into the market soon.  A market-neutral strategy of buying AXS perpetual contracts and selling borrowed AXS tokens will earn an annualized return of 56% (excluding the cost of borrowing AXS tokens).  According to Thielen, the token unlock could happen next week.  ""While the exact date is determined by the transaction block number, by some estimates, the vesting period ends approximately around Oct. 24-26,"" Thielen said.",POSITIVE,ADA | AXS,ADA | AXS | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/21/smart-money-eyes-market-neutral-trades-as-ada-axs-see-unusually-low-funding-rates,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6dc80c20dbff90ee6a31d04cbfd3f94cc5296f4c-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Brendler added that he is still positive on bitcoin’s long-term potential but he is “pulling the plug” for now on the miners as higher power costs, increasing network competition and debt burdens have further strained profitability and liquidity.  Previously, Brendler was optimistic about the miners as he predicted that lower bitcoin prices and higher costs would weed out the competition and lower the network hashrate. However, that didn’t play out as both network difficulty and hashrate are now near all-time highs.  Read more: Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Surges to All-Time High, Putting Additional Squeeze on Miners  The ongoing bear market has been particularly tough on the bitcoin mining sector, which saw the shares of publicly traded bitcoin miners fall by more than 70% this year, on average, according to FactSet data. Most recently, Argo was forced to raise $27 million to ease liquidity pressures, while one of the largest mining data center providers, Compute North, filed for bankruptcy.  Amid this backdrop, two of the largest miners, Riot Blockchain (RIOT) and Marathon Digital (MARA), are Brendler’s top picks as “as both have low-cost power, funded growth plans, and ample liquidity to capitalize on the impending shakeout.”  Brendler noted that the decision to downgrade Core Scientific wasn’t an easy one because he still sees it as “best-in-class in many ways,” echoing Barclays’ analyst who called the company a “best-in-class, leveraged play on the crypto ecosystem” earlier this month.  However, Brendler said that Core Scientific now faces “multiple acute challenges” and his recent industry checks suggest that the company has “a significantly more stressed liquidity position than expected.”  Read more: Crypto Miners Face Margin Calls, Defaults as Debt Comes Due in Bear Market",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/10/21/wall-street-analyst-pulling-the-plug-on-bitcoin-miners-owing-to-bear-market-woes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4838ef4103430d0eb462dcc854d4041b6690a5bf-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""We do not expect the Fed to embark on easing until 2024, and a trough in growth also seems months away,"" he wrote. Checking the experience of the 1970s – which was also a period of high inflation – Trivedi noted the dollar didn't begin to weaken until economic activity was declining and the Federal Reserve loosened its monetary policy.  That could be bad news for bitcoin (BTC). Among any number of reasons for the crypto's bear market of the past year, high on the list is the strong dollar. Bottoming in the middle of 2021 at just under the 90 level, the U.S. dollar index has shot higher to its current level of 113.69 – the strongest reading since early 2002.  Trivedi did offer some hope for dollar bears (and bitcoin bulls), suggesting it's possible the European economy strengthens, new leadership at the Bank of Japan could be more hawkish and China may back off its policy of zero tolerance for COVID-19 – all of which might tend to put pressure on the U.S. dollar, although he said, ""We are not there yet.""

Amendments introduced by Financial Services and City Minister Andrew Griffith to his own bill on Friday have been welcomed by an industry that has called for proposals to extend beyond stablecoins, which are digital assets pegged to relatively stable assets like the U.S. dollar.  The measures amend existing laws to ""clarify that the powers relating to financial promotion and regulated activities can be relied on to regulate crypto assets and activities relating to crypto assets,"" said an explanatory note put forth by Griffith and published Friday, as an amendment to the Financial Services and Markets Bill. Under the U.K. laws dating back to 2000, it is prohibited to carry out regulated financial activities without permission.  The measures seem likely to find favor with an industry that has been crying out for more regulatory certainty, like that offered by the European Union with its Markets in Crypto Assets regulation (MiCA).  ""The amendments enable the Treasury and FCA [Financial Conduct Authority] to introduce a full regulatory regime for crypto, a hugely positive step,"" Nicholas Taylor, head of public policy at crypto exchange Luno, told CoinDesk in an emailed statement. Luno is owned by the Digital Currency Group, which is also CoinDesk's parent company.  Andrew Jackson of fintech industry group Innovate Finance also drew attention to the lack of legal clarity surrounding crypto at a hearing on the bill Wednesday.  Regulators have also been itching to extend their powers to cover crypto. In August, the FCA went so far as to set out the restrictions it wants to put on crypto ads in advance of legislation.  The bill is due to be discussed in committee between now and Nov. 3, but may be affected by the departure of Prime Minister Liz Truss, announced Thursday. The nomination of a successor, due next week, may herald a change in other ministerial positions.

The announcement was made Thursday at the 90th Interpol General Assembly in New Delhi.  Its purpose will range from offering immersive training courses to law enforcement across the globe, to touring the virtual facsimile of the Interpol General Secretariat headquarters in Lyon, France, to interacting with other officers via their avatars.  Interpol is an abbreviation of ""international police."" The organization has issued a ""red notice"" for Kwon, who faces a warrant for his arrest in South Korea on charges of fraud.  “For many, the metaverse seems to herald an abstract future, but the issues it raises are those that have always motivated Interpol – supporting our member countries to fight crime and making the world, virtual or not, safer for those who inhabit it,” Interpol Secretary General Jürgen Stock said in a press release.  Interpol also announced it is forming a metaverse expert group, which will represent concerns of law enforcement on the global stage. The World Economic Forum, a partner organization of Interpol's, has warned that ""social engineering scams, violent extremism and misinformation could be particular challenges"" in the metaverse.  “By identifying these risks from the outset, we can work with stakeholders to shape the necessary governance frameworks and cut off future criminal markets before they are fully formed,” Madan Oberoi, Interpol's executive director of technology and innovation, said in the release.

42421226,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXhqjl,1666353579,"DeFi’s ‘Severe Threat’ Needs New Kind of Regulation, EU Commission Told","Decentralized finance (DeFi) could require new kinds of voluntary regulation to manage the severe threats it poses, finance professor Tarik Roukny told the European Commission, as the EU regulatory entity ponders how to regulate a sector that doesn’t easily fit under existing financial norms.  The commission seems set to take Roukny's comments on board as it finalizes the landmark Markets in Crypto Assets law (MiCA), which largely regulates centralized entities, and turns policy attention towards more distributed forms of lending or investment that are based on software protocols.  “DeFi tools hold a credible promise for new forms of financial services adapted to a globalized, competitive, fair and digital economy,” Roukny, an assistant professor from Leuven University in Belgium, said at a commission webinar Friday, after issuing a report on DeFi to the body. “At the same time,"" he added, ""severe threats to consumers, producers and the economy at large accompany this opportunity.”  MiCA's approach to regulating entities such as crypto wallet providers or stablecoins that seek to maintain their value to fiat currencies will only get you so far in DeFi, where many participants could seek to hide their identity, Roukny believes.  One alternative is to get providers to sign up voluntarily to regulation, Roukny said. A “public stamp of approval” might mitigate users’ fears they’re being led into a rug pull or other scam.  Read more: Industry Offers Cautious Welcome to EU’s Landmark Crypto Law MiCA  “You need to find incentives to make it attractive for protocol designers and protocol developers to enter a policy framework or to enter the sandbox you have in mind – and that is crucially different from a lot of other services,” he said.  Public authorities could also issue warnings about faulty DeFi protocols, he suggests, citing the example of the MIT Digital Currency Initiative that in 2017 forced the IOTA protocol to improve its security by pointing out flaws.  There could also be specific rules for oracles, the services which interface between protocols and the real world – providing the details of, say, election results that aren’t subject to normal crypto validation procedures but might trigger a specific smart contract.  “T​​here may be large benefits from interventions like public oracles, licensed oracles or more generally regulated oracle markets that compensate for the unverifiable nature of the information,” Roukny said.  There are signs that the commission will take those proposals seriously as it follows through on the MiCA mandate to consider DeFi regulation over the coming years.  “This report is part of our ambition to understand DeFi further, to inform our thinking about how to address any concern potential public public policy consequences,” said Mattias Levin, deputy head of the commission team responsible for digital finance, speaking at the same event.  “DeFi is rapidly emerging, albeit from a low base – but there's a strong policy interest in understanding the phenomenon further, and to try to see what are the economics and the legal implications of it,” Levin added.

Telegram, which has over 700 million users, announced via an official channel on Thursday that the development phase of the auction platform was over and will be rolled out soon.  Durov first voiced Telegram's intention to introduce an auction for usernames in August, creating ""a new platform where username holders could transfer them to interested parties in protected deals – with ownership secured on the blockchain via [non-fungible token]-like smart contracts.""  The TON blockchain was developed by Telegram alongside its messaging app, but was abandoned in August 2020 following a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Developers of the ecosystem subsequently formed the TON Foundation to keep the project alive, efforts which Durov endorsed.  Toncoin (TON), the native coin of the TON blockchain, is up nearly 9% at $1.34 in the last 24 hours following news that it will be used to purchase usernames on Telegram.

42388826,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRTxuZ,1666348336,THE Memes Won’t DIE: Crypto Hopefuls Seek Value in Joke Tokens After Vitalik Buterin’s Tweets,"Don’t cry over it being a range-bound market.  A new class of meme tokens created over the past week has returned multiples to early investors, with market capitalization reaching over $50 million in some cases.  The memes aren’t even about food, dogs or other animals anymore. Instead, crypto hopefuls have turned their attention to a yet unexplored, and rather niche, area of comedy – articles from the English language.  One of the most-traded tokens on the decentralized exchange Uniswap is called THE, which has seen some $10 million in on-chain trading volume and counts over 5,000 holders as of Friday afternoon.  THE was created after Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin, presumably joking, said on Twitter last week: “Someone should make a project called ""THE Protocol,"" so that their shills can say ""Look, soandso mentioned THE!"" pretty much any time anyone says anything.”  Twitter users rightfully pointed out that such tokens were probably on their way, shortly after Buterin’s tweet. And the predictions didn’t disappoint: Someone issued and floated THE tokens on Uniswap.  This was followed by other articles, such as THIS, THEY and THAT, all of which today have dozens of iterations on blockchains like Ethereum, BNB Chain, Solana and others.  Anyone can call a smart contract and issue tokens on Ethereum (or other blockchains) for a few cents, and the presence of decentralized exchanges means tokens can instantly be issued, supplied with liquidity and traded soon after.  The premise doesn’t matter: if there’s money to be made peddling trendy topics; expect a market for it somewhere in niche ""s**tcoin"" circles.  THE has surged over 1,000% in the past few days, and another surged 800%. Somewhere in that process the punters even started to bet on “DIE” – the German word for “the” – with some DIE tokens attracting hundreds of thousands of dollars in liquidity.  Why are such meme coins popular?  Some professional investors told CoinDesk that meme coins and their narratives will always remain a part of the crypto ecosystem.  “Meme coins are huge parts of the crypto trading landscape, whether we like it or not,” James Wo, founder at crypto fund DFG, told CoinDesk. “While the biggest currencies like bitcoin and ether have very low volatility, it's only natural that traders will look for opportunities elsewhere.”  “Meme trading is a risky way to try to seek excessive return, but when it pans out, the upside can be very huge. So even in a bear market, some of the meme coins will have large up-swing, even if it's just short term,” Wo explained.  The crypto market is equal parts legitimacy and memes. Serious investors and developers build financial services based on smart contracts to allow global users to trade, lend assets and take out loans in a permissionless setting, in line with the ethos of relying on technology instead of third parties to access financial services.  There are then the meme artists. Dog coins, cat coins, food coins and meme coins command billions of dollars in market capitalization, data shows, each iteration savvier than the rest.  As such, THE isn’t the only instance of crypto hopefuls creating a s**tcoin market.  In January, Grimacecoin tokens created after a McDonald’s joke tweet surged as much as 285,000% in a few hours as opportunistic actors jumped at the chance to make cash in a tepid crypto market. The hype faded shortly afterward – with nearly every GRIMACE falling 99% in the weeks later.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/21/the-memes-wont-die-crypto-hopefuls-seek-value-in-joke-tokens-after-vitalik-buterins-tweets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d7ec0ccd2df9130d2df5f955d9752d1e9f682e7d-3632x2496.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42388827,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRTxzF,1666345119,DeFi Options Platform Opyn's 'Crab Strategy' Generates 14% Return in Comatose Ether Market,"A decentralized finance (DeFi) product that launched earlier this year to help investors profit from a sideways trending market is generating desired results.  The ""Crab"" strategy, designed by leading DeFi options platform Opyn, is built to make money during bouts of low ether (ETH) price volatility. It has earned 14% returns in U.S. dollar terms and 42% in ether terms since its version (v)2 went live in late July. Ether has dropped 20% since the end of July, however, the cryptocurrency has primarily traded between $1,100 to $1,300 in the past four weeks.  The strategy is yet another example of the DeFi industry helping investors bypass complexities involved with traditional option strategies like a ""short straddle,"" often set up by sophisticated market participants during a market lull.  In case of a short straddle, a trader sells bullish and bearish options contracts called a call and put on a centralized exchange. If the market stays rangebound, the short straddle makes money. Setting up such multi-leg strategies is easier said than done, as traders must select appropriate levels to buy/sell options and the expiration date and actively manage the position as several factors influence options prices.  In Opyn's crab strategy, users only need to deposit ETH as collateral to start profiting from a comatose market. And investors seem to be piling money into the automated product.  ""When Crab v2 went live, the strategy had 888 ETH. Currently, the strategy has 5,378 ETH, a 505% increase in three months,"" Wade Prospere, head of marketing and community at Opyn, told CoinDesk.  Crab's inner working  The crab strategy is built on top of Opyn's Squeeth or squared ether – an index tracking ether's price change to the power of two and allowing buyers to earn more when the market rallies and lose less during price drops in return for hefty funding rates – costs for keeping the so-called power perpetual position open.  After users deposit ETH as collateral, the crab vault combines long ETH with a short (bearish) Squeeth position, creating a market-neutral position.  That allows crab depositors to collect the funding rate – the cost of holding long positions – paid by the Squeeth buyers without having to worry about the risk of a rally in ETH and Squeeth. Due to the attractive payoff, the funding rate paid by buyers is higher than that paid in a standard perpetual futures market and a 2x leveraged long position.  Essentially, the vault is short Squeeth with a hedge.  ""The crab strategy allows users to earn funding (yield) from being short Squeeth regardless of whether ETH will move up or down. In other words, Crab v2 is a delta-neutral [market neutral] strategy,"" Prospere said.  The strategy rebalances every Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 16:30 coordinated universal time to maintain the market-neutral position.  ""If ETH price decreases, the strategy sells Squeeth tokens for ETH (meaning it buys more ETH to remain market neutral),"" Prospere said. The crab, therefore, stacks ether during the bear market.  Depositors receive a payoff if ether does not move X% up or down between rebalances. The percentage is determined by the funding rate received from the Squeeth buyers and keeps changing daily.  At press time, the crab strategy promised to pay out if ether did not move more than 4.22% between rebalancing periods.  While the one-click strategy to profit from potential consolidation may look appealing to retail investors, it is not without risks. As with short straddle, crab depositors stand to lose money if ether charts a violent price move in either direction.  As the payoff diagram shows, the crab strategy is suitable for sideways market conditions when ether trades relatively stable.  ""If ETH moves more than an amount [percentage] that is based on the funding received from the short Squeeth position, the strategy is unprofitable on that day,"" Prospere wrote in an official explainer.  ""If the crab Strategy falls below the safe collateralization threshold (150%), the strategy is at risk of liquidation,"" Prospere added.

Korean Prosecutors Say Reports of Do Kwon's Stopover in Dubai 'Not False': Bloomberg,"The co-founder of Terraform Labs, Do Kwon, is rumored to have left Singapore for Dubai – rumors that may have some validity, Bloomberg reported on Friday.  On Thursday there were reports Kwon had left Singapore last month and landed in Dubai. According to Bloomberg, South Korean prosecutors have said that the report was ""not false.""  The Terra ecosystem imploded in May, evaporating $60 billion in value, after which Kwon faced charges of violating capital markets laws in South Korea.  Having departed his native country for Singapore, Kwon denied reports that he was on the run, despite Interpol issuing a ""red notice"" for his arrest. He claimed he had moved to Singapore before the collapse of the Terra ecosystem.  Terraform Labs and the Seoul Prosecutors Office did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for comment.  Terra's collapse led to far-reaching damage across the crypto industry with reports of some investors losing their life savings.

Private stablecoins are designed to maintain stable values relative to a reference currency like the U.S. dollar or an asset like gold, while CBDCs are digital versions of sovereign currencies.  Project Aurum – named after the Latin word for gold – shows CBDCs used by retail customers can be private and flexible, said its architects, who also include the Bank for International Settlements Innovation Hub and a research institute.  “Project Aurum has made a number of ground-breaking achievements,” said the study. “We have no doubt that the Aurum prototype will catalyze and inspire the global quest for the most suitable rCBDC [retail CBDC] architecture.”  Over 100 jurisdictions worldwide are looking into issuing a CBDC, according to the Atlantic Council, and experiments are taking place across the world.  Those projects often assume banks or other payment companies would intermediate the service. Crucially, Aurum also tested out a system where regular shoppers don't get their hands directly on a CBDC but instead use private stablecoins – in the same way modern-day card payments use commercial bank money backed up by central bank guarantees.  “Bringing CBDC-backed stablecoins to life has never been done before,” the study said. “The system developed for the CBDC-backed stablecoins is unique and can be useful” for central banks, it added.  Funds were made traceable on the prototype so customers could get their money back if the intermediary goes bust – but it would still safeguard privacy through the use of pseudonyms, the study said.

Gas fees refers to a fee paid by users to perform any function on a blockchain. These can range from a few pennies to several hundred dollars based on demand or the underlying network.  Utilizing MIST will also mitigate the insufficient gas problems caused by coin dust, a phenomena where coins with very low value that are stored in a users’ wallet add up to tens of dollars over time and become unusable due to high gas fees.  The SUI coin balance in Move or Sui protocol was previously interpreted as SUI directly. For example, a SUI coin with a balance of 100 used to be interpreted as 100 SUI.
