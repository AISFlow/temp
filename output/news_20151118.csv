42378394,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i6Fb,1447878043,UK Treasury: Digital Currencies Pose Lowest Money Laundering Risk,"Digital currencies were deemed a ""low"" risk for money laundering and terrorism financing in a report published last month by the UK government.  In a National Risk Assessment released 15th October by HM Treasury, the government said that digital currencies present the lowest risk rating among money laundering vehicles, a list that also includes cash, banks and accountancy services.  ""The money laundering risk associated with digital currencies is low, though if the use of digital currencies was to become more prevalent in the UK this risk could rise,"" the report states. It goes on to acknowledge that, at present, instances of observed money laundering involving the technology are relatively few, whereas the majority of the criminal use has been in transactions to illicit online markets.  According to the report:  ""There are a limited number of case studies upon which any solid conclusions could be drawn that digital currencies are used for money laundering. There are concerns around anonymity, faster payments, and ability to provide cross border remittances and facilitate international trade. These issues are similar to issues identified with many other financial instruments, such as cash and e-money.""  The evidence that does exist, the report said, relates to occasions in which law enforcement reportedly observed money laundering taking place at the exchange level.  ""Law enforcement agencies have identified, in a limited number of cases, criminals using large franchised [money services businesses] MSBs to purchase digital currencies from exchangers,"" the report states. ""This method, law enforcement agencies believe, has been developed to avoid the retail banking sector.""  Further, there appears to be few indications that digital currencies are being used by money laundering specialists working on behalf of ‘traditional’ criminal groups.  The report also suggests that there isn’t much in the way of proof that terrorists are using digital currencies to move money and fund operations, adding:  ""There is little evidence to indicate that the use of digital currencies has been adopted by criminals involved in terrorist financing, whether as a means by which to raise funds (crowd funding etc.), to pay for infrastructure (e.g. server rental), or to transfer funds.""

42378386,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i65X,1447876599,German Bank Association: Blockchain Could Revolutionize Securities,"The German banking industry association Bankenverband (BdB) recently said that it believes that blockchain technology may have a significant impact on financial markets.  In a new document, BdB’s Digital Agenda Committee responded to member questions on how it believes developments in the field of financial technology will impact the domestic banking industry, speculating that the blockchain could affect the stock market and payments sectors.  The comments come in response to a question that centered on whether large technology groups such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook or Google could leverage cryptographic financial systems as a way to disrupt banking. Of note for the inquirer was the recent decision by the European Court of Justice that bitcoin transactions in Germany would be exempt from value-added tax (VAT).  In its remarks, however, BdB was less than optimistic about the use of bitcoin by these companies saying that it remains to be seen if it will be used by consumers given that it is currently ""impractical in everyday life"".  The organization continued:  ""Much more relevant to the developments in the financial services industry is that which lies behind bitcoin, the blockchain technology. Blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize the entire present-day settlement system in the securities sector.""  Still, the group cautioned that customer reactions to the technology ""cannot be estimated today"" and that commercial applications of blockchain technology may create ""opportunities or risks"", making its assessment largely speculative.  BdB boasts more than 200 German banks as members, with more well-known members including Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, institutions that are currently openly working on blockchain projects through a partnership with industry startup R3.

42378395,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i6Gr,1447873597,Core Developers Call for New Bitcoin Software Strategy at MIT,"Bitcoin Core developers Gavin Andresen, Cory Fields and Wladimir van der Laan expanded on their larger vision for development of the open-source bitcoin project at an event held yesterday by their new employer, MIT Media Lab.  In the hour-and-a-half session, moderated by MIT Media Lab director Joi Ito, Andresen voiced his belief that bitcoin needs to evolve away from having one dominant software implementation, stating that he believes the project to be in the midst of this transition.  The remark comes amid a larger debate focused on updating bitcoin’s software to allow for a greater number of transactions to be included in blocks, and found the developers seeking to add nuance to the debate. For example, Cory Fields, positioned the current situation as analogous to when the Internet primarily relied on one browser.  ""Internet Explorer 6 at one point defined the internet,"" Fields said. ""We're in the process of trying to get away from that one true implementation that we have now.""  Overall, the talk found the developers seeking to make known their vision for an open-source project that, despite being the subject of more than $900m in venture capital investment, remains mired in governance considerations and philosophical debates.  The process found Andresen, bitcoin's long-time maintainer, offering his interpretations of how the project should be defined:  ""There are three things I think of when I hear bitcoin, the digital currency, the digital cash of the Internet, that’s lowercase 'b' bitcoin, there’s bitcoin the code that runs the network and then there’s bitcoin the protocol.""  Fields said that, to date, development discussions have so far grouped together management of the code with the protocol itself.  ""A lot of other protocols start with high-level description. We started with the code Satoshi [Nakamoto] wrote, and have to get rid of all the nasty corner cases we’re finding … [But] we are getting to a place where one could write a protocol specification document and have it be 100% correct,"" he continued.  Elsewhere, Andresen proposed that having multiple versions of the bitcoin software – such as Bitcoin Core and his proposal Bitcoin XT (though it was not named directly) – would guard against scenarios where issues with one implementation could take down the entire network.  ""There are efforts to break Core up into more manageable chunks … There's this huge industry resting on your shoulders, you have a huge responsibility not to screw it up,"" Andresen said, adding:  ""One way to screw it up is to not do anything. It does have to evolve.""  Issue of consensus  The developers also sought to make clear their view of where development challenges currently reside, noting how bitcoin remains a unique open-source project due to its design.  ""Any software project has interesting challenges,"" Fields said. “[But bitcoin operates on] consensus. Where most coders are used to the idea of if you implement it this way, and if you get this answer, it’s wrong. In bitcoin, the generally accepted answer is the correct answer, even if it’s wrong.""  Andresen went on to note how this need to achieve consensus across a diverse array of network participants means that development of the software is naturally slow and that easy solutions for other types of software don’t translate well to this environment.  ""Auto update gets brought up often,"" Fields said. ""[But in bitcoin], upgrading is a vote, whether it’s the node or wallet you’re running. So it’s not really possible for us to implore you to jump to the new [software version].""  Andresen indicated that he believes Bitcoin Core needs to do more to incentivize miners who process transactions to upgrade software by packaging releases with this group in mind.  ""It's always a challenge to get miners to upgrade, part of that is giving them something they want, making it faster, more efficient, using less CPU, less network bandwidth,"" he continued. ""There has to be some reason for them to upgrade.""  Existential challenges  Ito directed a number of questions toward encouraging the developers to articulate how they might respond to more unusual challenges, such as if government regulators attempted to put pressure on the project.  Here, Andresen suggested that he believes it’s ""hard to imagine"" how regulation could be crafted for the protocol given that such rulemakings usually affect the businesses using a technology.  ""[People talk about] what if the current maintainers get swayed by regulators, but it’s not even clear, if some government could hold a gun to our heads, it’s unclear what we could do,"" he remarked.  Fields suggested pressure could come if Bitcoin Core developers sought to enable software users to make transactions ""entirely anonymous"" through their work on the protocol.  Ito then voiced his opinion of how concepts like money laundering are often a matter of definition calling it a ""meta crime"". He went on to note that while the US might ""expect transparency"" in transactions made by its citizens and entities, a greater level of privacy from such oversight may be desired in countries with more authoritative regimes.  Andresen responded by stating his view that anonymity should be a feature of bitcoin wallets that allow transactions on the network, but that his team could provide the tools for these designs.  ""The low-level protocol privacy features could be controversial. [But] if they are cryptographic primitives, it would have some other use,"" he added.  Continued conversation  As for how they see the question of bitcoin’s software capabilities, like the size of transaction blocks on the network, moving forward, the developers were less clear, remarking that they don’t “pretend to understand” what they view as a new and novel argument.  “There are so many different perspectives and variables and things that need to be analyzed and discussed. I think the reason that it's such a sexy and divisive issue is because it's really easy to take one and say this thing matters, this is important to me, so I'm going to jump on this and it can appear easy,” Fields said.  To this, Ito drew on his experience at ICANN, the nonprofit group that oversees top-level domains on the Internet protocol, advising that an open and tiresome dialogue can be the most beneficial way to solve issues between diverse stakeholders.  “The thing is by making ICANN completely open and not eliminating people from showing up, you eliminate the argument that they weren't able to participate or weren't able to be in the conversation,” Ito advised.  The developers suggested that such a scenario is likely to play out at the upcoming Scaling Bitcoin conference in Hong Kong.  Hong Kong agenda  As for any additional specifics about the follow-up to September’s well-received inaugural Scaling Bitcoin conference in Montreal, the developers were less clear.  Andresen, for example, distanced himself from the idea that the developers should be the decision-makers at the event, to be held from 6th to 7th December, arguing that the community will need to have the final say.  ""It's not the developers deciding what bitcoin should be. It's everybody in the ecosystem needs to decide how bitcoin should evolve and what's it going to be,"" he said.  Andresen implied he may ultimately encourage a governance structure for the conversations that draws on Ito’s approach, indicating that there will be follow-on meetings.  ""Ultimately I decided everybody would be in a room and do whatever [they] feel like, just because it's so hard to commit to something and say we really can knock this out. I think that's overambitious,"" he said.  As for firm details about Scaling Bitcoin’s agenda, the website is also vague at this time, noting only that its call for proposals has now closed and that block size proposals will be included in the conference’s itinerary.

42378378,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i5wj,1447861747,Bitcoin Exchange Operator Pleads Not Guilty to Money Laundering,"The former operator of bitcoin exchange Coin.mx, Anthony Murgio, has plead not guilty to money laundering.  According to Bloomberg  , Murgio also plead not guilty to operating the bitcoin exchange, wire fraud and conspiracy.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, Murgio was charged with one count of money laundering and one count of willful failure to submit a suspicious activity report. He was arrested alongside Yuri Lebedev in July and accused of using Coin.mx as a money channel for a series of online criminal enterprises.  Both him and Lebedev were charged with one count of conspiracy to create an unlicensed money transmitting business and one count of running an unlicensed money transmitting business.  Earlier this month, US prosecutors unsealed a new indictment filed against Murgio. The court documents named charges against three other individuals: Gery Shalon, Joshua Aaron and Ziv Orenstein. All three were accused of money laundering, computer hacking and securities fraud charges.  According to the US government, Coin.mx is thought to have been used as a means to launder illicit funds.  Additionally, the three defendants are believed to have created a web of digital criminal activity, dating as far back as 2012, which included in a cyberattack against JPMorgan Chase last year.  Murgio, who is free on bond, is expected to appear in court for trial on 31st October 2016.

42378385,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i64H,1447860023,Mutual Fund Giant Fidelity Accepts Bitcoin Through Charity Arm,"Fidelity Charitable, the public charity arm of US mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments, has announced customers can now use bitcoin to support charities through its donor-advised funds.  According to the organization’s latest annual report, Fidelity Charitable customers had more than 63,000 donor-advised accounts open as of 2014, with the median giving balance equalling roughly $16,000.  In statements  , Fidelity Charitable senior vice president Matt Nash sought to emphasize that the move was geared toward maximizing the ways in which its 100,000 donors could engage in philanthropic giving.  Nash said:  ""Enabling donors to contribute bitcoin to their donor-advised funds is the latest example of Fidelity Charitable's commitment to making it as easy as possible for donors to support the charities they care about with the assets at their disposal. There are many tax advantages to donating long-term appreciated assets, and that ultimately means more money to charity.""  As part of the offering, Fidelity will use bitcoin services provided by Coinbase to convert bitcoin donations into US dollars, which will then be allocated to the individual’s donor-advised fund and to specific charities.  ""Upon approval of a grant recommendation, the charity receives the full amount of the grant by check or EFT, which is easier to accept and carries no transaction fee,"" Fidelity said.  The announcement marks Fidelity’s first public move to embrace bitcoin or blockchain technology, though it follows a period of increased interest from the Boston-based company. A representative from Fidelity Labs, for example, spoke yesterday on a Cardozo School of Law panel covering ""emergent applications"" of blockchain technology.

42378397,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i6EL,1447851632,Capgemini: Finance 'Can't Ignore' Blockchain Tech,"A new report from consulting and technology services firm Capgemini advises financial services firms that they can no longer ""afford to ignore"" blockchain technology.  Released on 13th November, the paper argues that the blockchain and distributed ledgers have the potential to broadly impact traditional financial services providers. It proceeds to outline steps affected institutions can take to evaluate various platforms and players currently available.  Overall, the report argues that traditional financial providers will look to the technology as a way to reduce costs related to data management in the short term and make existing processes ""more efficient, transparent and inexpensive"".  The report reads:  ""Blockchain changes the IT paradigm for processing and has the potential to create a very different model for managing transaction-processing contracts. It also enables all processing to be done over a distributed systems network or in the cloud, avoiding the use of costly data centers and mainframes.""  Included is Capgemini's nine-step approach to evaluating blockchain technology providers, which encourages institutions to analyze factors including security, decentralization, privacy, scalability, usability, extensibility, cost, operational impact and community support.  In addition to highlighting the bitcoin blockchain, other platforms mentioned as part of the report include BitShares, Counterparty, Ethereum, Factom and Ripple.  The report further highlights the differences between permissionless blockchains – those that do not restrict participants from transaction verification – and permissioned alternatives that allow for more control over who participates in the creation and procurement of a shared ledger.  Capgemini's latest release comes amidst an uptick in research reports seeking to appeal to enterprise financial services providers and aimed at assessing blockchain technology. In recent weeks, similarly positive reports have been published by firms such as Tabb Group and GreySpark Partners.
