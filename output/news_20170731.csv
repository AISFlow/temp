42427644,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL2lRh,1501534241,The Bitcoin Cash Timeline: What Will Happen When,"Jimmy Song is a bitcoin developer and principal architect at blockchain technology startup Paxos.  In this opinion piece, Song discusses the upcoming launch of Bitcoin Cash, outlining how it will (and won't) impact the bitcoin blockchain in the coming days and weeks.      We're less than 24 hours away from the launch of Bitcoin Cash.  Whether you're worried, interested or excited, you can't deny that the event – which will likely see a new cryptocurrency created from the existing bitcoin blockchain – will have ramifications on the larger ecosystem.  In this article, I'm going to go over the different things you can expect in the next few days.  July 31  As you may have seen on social media, exchanges and merchants are currently scrambling to prepare for the fork.  At a minimum, these custodians of customer bitcoins will want to record customer balances right before the hard fork so they can untangle who's entitled to what later. (Or risk facing accounting challenges).  More adventurous exchanges are preparing to list Bitcoin Cash as a separate asset, though this presents its own problems.  For one, listing a cryptocurrency that hasn't launched could prove difficult. Also, once markets are live, trading is likely to be choppy. (Part of what caused crazy volatility during the Zcash launch was that so few exchanges supported it during the first few days.)  This probably won't be the case as many exchanges have already committed to supporting the trade of Bitcoin Cash, but it bears watching.  We can expect many exchanges to freeze withdrawals in preparation of the above.  August 1, 00:00 UTC  This is the expected time of the BIP 148 UASF launch.  Because the bitcoin network is already enforcing BIP 91, this should be a non-event. That is, BIP 148 won't split the network and bitcoin will continue as a single chain.  August 1, 12:20 UTC  Bitcoin Cash will launch.  At this point, miners that are mining Bitcoin Cash will create a transaction block greater than 1 MB in size and fork the bitcoin network.  There are a few scenarios here that depend on the percentage of hash power that the new blockchain attracts:  If less than 16% of bitcoin's current hash power transitions to Bitcoin Cash, the first block will likely take over an hour. This won't affect the bitcoin blockchain that much, though on average, blocks should take a little longer than 10 minutes.  If 17-50% of hash power moves to mining Bitcoin Cash, the first block will likely take between 20 minutes to an hour. This will slow down the bitcoin blockchain somewhat. Blocks on bitcoin will take between 12-20 minutes.  If more than 50% of hash power is mining Bitcoin Cash, the first block will likely take less than 20 minutes. This will slow down the bitcoin blockchain significantly. Blocks on bitcoin will take longer than 20 minutes on average.  During this time, users will likely begin sending Bitcoin Cash to exchanges that both list the cryptocurrency and that have vowed to continue operations through the fork.  We can expect that the exchanges that accept Bitcoin Cash deposits first will have a lot of activity, and that initial trading will likely cause some significant price volatility due to reduced liquidity.  As for transaction approvals, even with low hashing power, we can expect the Bitcoin Cash mempool to be relatively empty since the network's blocks will be relatively big.  At 12.5% hash power, the mempool on Bitcoin Cash will clear at about the same rate as bitcoin. That said, confirmations will be much slower for the coin with less hash power until difficulty adjusts.  August 3–7  If Bitcoin Cash has relatively low hashing power, we can expect some difficulty adjustments at this time. Most scenarios result in something close to 10-minute block times provided the hash power stays constant.  This is probably not a safe assumption as miners will likely be switching between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash depending on which one is more profitable.  Bitcoin Cash will be much easier to mine after the difficulty adjustments, and we may get some relatively fast blocks (2.5 minutes or less) until we hit block 479,808.  August 8–14  SegWit should lock in on bitcoin around this time.  Depending on how much mining power moves over to Bitcoin Cash, and how much new mining power shows up, lock-in on block 479,808 on bitcoin may take longer than expected.  Once lock in is achieved, the code will be activated later this month, effectively upgrading the main bitcoin blockchain to support larger-capacity transactions.  For a more detailed outline of SegWit activation, read our full guide here.

42427651,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL2lfh,1501530347,Bitcoin Cash 101: What Users Need to Know Before the Fork,"Bitcoin is headed toward a fork tomorrow.  Whether that happens for sure remains to be seen, but if it does, and you hold bitcoin, there are a few things you will want to keep in mind.  First, starting August 1 at about 12:20 UTC, mining pool ViaBTC will give miners who are a part of its pool the option to direct their computing power to a new, controversial software client known as Bitcoin ABC.  Should enough miners take up that option, the result will be a permanent divergence in the bitcoin blockchain and the creation of a new cryptocurrency known as bitcoin cash.  Proposed by developer Amaury Séchet, Bitcoin ABC is an alternative protocol that will boost bitcoin's transaction capacity. The client increases bitcoin's block size parameter to 8 MB and removes the long-debated code optimization Segregated Witness, which is due to activate on the main bitcoin blockchain later in August.  Of the more than 20 bitcoin mining pools, ViaBTC is the only pool to publicly support Bitcoin ABC, so far.  Although most bitcoin developers, entrepreneurs and users seem uninterested in moving over to Bitcoin ABC, the new protocol is not without eager supporters, which makes it hard to tell how things will play out.  We don't know, for instance, how much mining power will go to the new blockchain, whether the fork will result in something long lasting or if the new cryptocurrency will fall to the wayside due to lack of support.  Before those questions are answered, here are a few essentials to keep keep in mind.  What is a fork?  A hard fork is a permanent divergence in the blockchain.  Essentially, a new software client is presented, in this case, Bitcoin ABC. Some nodes will upgrade to the new client, but others will not. Because bitcoin is decentralized, it will be up to each individual user to decide on their own which software to run.  Once the first block with the new rules is mined, other miners may decide to move their computing power over to the new chain and build on that initial block. If enough miners begin to move over, this is where a possible ""split"" could happen.  Although, the original bitcoin chain will likely have the majority hash power and grow at a faster rate than the new chain, the overall result will be two blockchains. Both chains will share the same origin and history up to the point where they diverge. And from there on, two separate networks will exist.  Depending on the amount of computing power behind it, Bitcoin ABC could become a serious contender in the cryptocurrency space. Or, if the miners supporting it switch back to the dominant chain, Bitcoin ABC may become nothing more than a distant memory in the ongoing saga of bitcoin.  Because the networks are separate, though, it will make no difference how much mining power gets diverted to the smaller chain. Bitcoin ABC will continue to co-exist, even if it has only a fraction of the computing power of the larger bitcoin chain.  Two sets of coins  When the bitcoin blockchain splits, the result will be two sets of tokens: bitcoin (BTC) on the original bitcoin blockchain, and bitcoin cash (BCC or BCH) on the new blockchain.  Anyone who holds bitcoins before the split will effectively hold coins on both chains after the split. In this case, anyone holding bitcoin tokens (BTC) on the original chain will end up with the same amount of bitcoin cash (BCC or BCH) on the other.  Your bitcoin will be safe, but if you want to make sure you have access to your bitcoin cash, you should check with your exchange to see what their policy is. The safest plan is to have control of your private keys before the split.  Whether it's worth it to do so will be up to each user. But if you think bitcoin cash will have no value, think again. Bitcoin cash futures are currently trading at $275 on ViaBTC's exchange.  As long as you have control of your private keys before August 1, 12:20 UTC, you will most likely have access to the bitcoin cash you are entitled to after the split. If you leave your bitcoin in an online exchange, however, that exchange will be in control of your bitcoin.  To control your keys, one option is to move your coins to hardware wallet, such as Trezor or Ledger, that keeps your keys on a secure USB device. Or you can download a mobile wallet software, such Airbitz or Mycelium.  But be careful. Some mobile wallets, including Electrum and GreenAddress, have said they will not support bitcoin cash.  Monitoring the fork  But how will you be able to tell if bitcoin has forked, or not?  Btcforkmonitor.info  is one site tracking potential bitcoin forks. If it detects a fork, a red notification promises to pop up at the top of the website.  Developers of the site are running both Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin Core nodes, so they can compare the two clients and see how many blocks are on one chain versus the other.  Still, since btcforkmonitor is an independent website, the information it presents may or may not be accurate. So, unless you want to run your own 150 GB Bitcoin ABC full node, it might be a good idea to check with other sources, such as other people running full nodes, and follow their updates on social media.

42427659,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL2lth,1501528557,New York City Staffer Sanctioned For Mining Bitcoins at Work,"An employee of New York City's Department of Education has been disciplined after being caught mining bitcoins on his work computer.  According to a recently published disposition from the City of New York Conflicts of Interest Board, department employee Vladimir Ilyayev admitted to mining bitcoin between for a period of several weeks between March and April 2014. Bitcoin mining is an energy intensive process by which new transactions are added to the blockchain, generating new coins with every block that is created.  Ilyayev is said to have installed mining software that ran at night, while he monitored progress from his home.  The document, which includes a signature from Ilyatev along with those from NYC Education Department counsel Karen Antoine and Conflicts of Interest Board chair Richard Briffault, states:  ""I ran bitcoin mining software on my [work] computer from 6:00 p.m. until 6:00 a.m. every night from March 19, 2014 until April 17, 2014, when my bitcoin mining software was shut down by [the Department of Education's] Division of Instructional and Information Technology"".  The board sanctioned Ilyayev for violating the city's statutes that relate to using city time and resources for financial gain, though in the end, he was required to forfeit four days of paid annual leave – worth a total of $611.  ""The Board, after reviewing prior cases involving the misuse of City time and resources for profit-making activities, has decided not to impose any additional penalty,"" the disposition states.  Public records indicate that Ilyayev's case isn't the first time that a New York Department of Education employee was investigated for using their work equipment to mine bitcoins.  According to a Conflicts of Interest Board letter from April 2015, a network engineer reportedly tried to run mining software on his Department of Education computer. However, the engineer was ultimately cleared as ""there is no evidence that [he] successfully obtained bitcoin.""  In January, an employee of the Federal Reserve Board of Directors was fined $5,000 and placed on probation after he was caught mining bitcoins on a server owned by the US central bank.

The joint venture, dubbed SBI Cosmoney, is expected to launch its remittance service last this year, the two firms said. Coinplug is working with SBI FinTech Solutions Co., which is part of the wider SBI business group that has invested in a number of blockchain startups.  That the two firms would launch a dedicated blockchain effort is perhaps unsurprising, given that SBI participated in Coinplug's $5 million funding round in October 2015.  In a statement, Coinplug CEO Ryan Uhr said that the goal of the partnership was to ""create an overseas remittance service that connects Korea to the world"". Founded in 2013, Coinplug offers a bitcoin exchange, electronic wallet, and online point-of-sales service for Korean users.  According to the announcement, the new venture will be supported in part by a separate remittance venture, SBI Remit, which has been in operation since 2010. The experience of that venture, SBI said, will be of great help to the new venture.""  Coinplug has worked on other blockchain-based remittance projects in the past.  In late 2015, CoinDesk reported that the startup was developing a prototype focused on international payments with KB Koomkin, one of the country's largest financial institutions.

42427640,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL2lLh,1501520118,"14,000 Coinbase Customers Could Be Affected by IRS Tax Summons","Digital currency exchange startup Coinbase is pushing back against a renewed court effort by the Internal Revenue Service to obtain information on some of its customers.  Earlier this month, the IRS sought to narrow the scope of its investigation of the startup's customers after running into opposition from both Coinbase itself as well as several of its customers. The dispute dates back to November, when the tax agency first went to court in a bid to obtain user records from Coinbase for the period between 2013 and 2015.  Ultimately, the IRS told the court that it would limit its investigation to customers who have conducted at least $20,000 in business during those years. Yet in a July 27 court filing, Coinbase argued that request remains overly broad, amounting to little more than a ""fishing expedition"" at the expense of lawful taxpayers rather than a serious investigative effort.  Indeed, one angle of the argument against the IRS summons is that the tax agency is primarily interested in pushing back against criticism of its digital currency policies.  Lawyers for Coinbase wrote in their opposition filing:  ""...the IRS, under pressure from critics in Congress, the General Accounting Office, and the Treasury Department, all of whom have called on the IRS to develop better policies, rules, data, and procedures with regard to digital currency tax reporting, decided to issue a John Doe summons to Coinbase in an attempt to show the critics that the IRS was taking 'tough' action rather than continuing to ignore the issue.""  Coinbase goes on to say that, under the narrowed summons, approximately 14,355 accounts would be subject to the data request.  According to a supplementary filing attributed to Coinbase's internal audit chief Jeff Cartwright, 6,178 of those accounts ""had a cumulative sell, send and receive (excluding buys) of less than $60,000 between 2013 and 2015.""  The startup ultimately requested that the court reject the tax agency's petition to enforce the summons. Further, Coinbase is seeking an evidentiary hearing, criticising the IRS for what it believes is a lack of evidence that its customers are trying to avoid their taxes.  ""The Government has now ‘narrowed’ its requests, providing no evidence to support its contentions and no explanation for why it has done so,"" the startup’s attorneys wrote.

42427657,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL2lph,1501515023,Japan's Fujitsu to 'Commercialize' Hyperledger Fabric Software by Next Year,"The research arm of Japanese IT firm Fujitsu has unveiled new technology it developed for the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain project as part of a plan to commercialize the software by next spring.  Billed as a means to speed up the rate of transactions for high-performance uses, Fujitsu Laboratories said today that it has developed and tested new tools to speed up transactions with Fabric. The first production-read version of Fabric was launched by the Linux Foundation earlier this month, coming weeks after the publication of a release candidate.  Fujitsu, according to the announcement, debuted the tech at the P2P Financial Systems 2017 conference, held between July 20-21 in London. The results, it said, amounted to a 2.7 times increase in the rate of transactions for the test network the firm created.  The company explained in a statement:  ""Fujitsu Laboratories implemented this technology in Hyperledger Fabric v0.6.1 and measured transaction performance on a blockchain platform consisting of four servers. Whereas the previous method could handle 500 transactions per second, Fujitsu Laboratories achieved 1,350 transactions per second using this newly developed technology, an improvement of approximately 2.7 times.""  ""With this technology, it has become possible to apply blockchain technology to online transaction systems, which require high performance,"" the company added.  Fujitsu went on to say that, as a next step, it will adapt the technology to the latest Fabric version. The firm is expected to commercialize the application during its parent company's fiscal year 2017, which ends in March 2018.  As reported last month, Fujitsu has also developed a new blockchain-based system for securely exchanging data among different parties without a centralized hub, which also runs on the Hyperledger Fabric platform.

42427658,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL2lrh,1501511729,The Simplest Way to Understand Why The DAO Was a Security,"Last Tuesday night, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ended months of speculation, breaking its silence on blockchain tokens and issuing a landmark report that said a blockchain-based project called The DAO had issued securities under U.S. law.  The report  , however, is important beyond its applicability to The DAO: It helps describe how the existing legal and regulatory framework for securities laws apply to crypto tokens more broadly. And, more specifically, it shows how a crucial concept – called the Howey Test – applies to the DAO and other tokens.  For those who aren't familiar, the Howey Test dates back to a 1946 Supreme Court ruling that established the basis for determining whether or not anything sold in the US, or to US investors, is a security.  The Howey Test is useful because it helps crystalize some of the most important aspects of federal securities laws into a relatively simple formula.  At a prominent meetup last Wednesday night, the story of the Howey Test was broken down into a very straightforward narrative by Cooley LLP partner and fintech practice lead Marco Santori. The text below, paraphrased from Santori, comes from the Cooley event.  Called ""The Dean of Digital Currency Lawyers"" by American Banker, Santori is considered by many in the space to be one of the leading lights on cryptocurrency legal theory. During his talk at the Cooley-hosted event, he demonstrated why.  Most descriptions of the Howey Test read like legal filings; Santori's description, on the other hand, sounds like a parable:    A long time ago, someone named Howey owned an orange grove.      Howey said: ""I've got this orange grove and I've got no way to make money out of it – because I need money to make money.""    Tell you what. I'm going to sell you this orange grove and, in exchange, you get whatever profits are made from that little plot.    I'll work the land. I'm going to pick the oranges. I'm going to squeeze the juice. You just pay me the money.    The plaintiffs said: ""That's a security.""    The SEC said: ""That's a security.""    Howey said: 'No, no. That's just selling plots of oranges.""    Ultimately, the Supreme Court said: ""That's a security"" – because it passed this test: There was an investment of money. And a common enterprise. With the expectation of profit, primarily from the efforts of others.    'Solid' regulation  At this point, you may be tempted to ask some questions.  Isn't the Howey Test over 70 years old? Yes, it is. And the underlying legal framework that Howey serves as a test for – principally The Securities Act of 1933 and The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 – are even older.  But, this composite regulatory regime has remained remarkably effective and relevant for three-quarters of a century, and it continues to be, as Santori said during the panel discussion, ""a testament to solid, principles-based regulation.""  While initial coin offerings, or ICOs, may be a very recent innovation — enabled by the whole complex stack of software technology — the SEC with its new report has reaffirmed that there is nothing new under the sun.  Applying the lessons learned from the SEC's report on The DAO, we can go one step further to tell a new type of tale.  Here's how we might adapt this ultra-modern scenario to the decades-old tale:    Not so long ago, a group of developers started a DAO.      The DAO developers said: ""There are all these decentralized projects and there's no way for them to get funding – because they need money to make money.""    Tell you what. We're going to write code and sell a token and, in exchange, people who buy the token will get whatever profits are made from those projects.    We'll work the code. They'll pick the projects. The projects will flourish and everyone will profit.    The SEC said: ""That’s a security.""    The DAO developers said: ""No, no. That's just selling tokens.""    Ultimately, the SEC said: ""That's a security"" – because of the application of the Howey Test: There was an investment of money. And a common enterprise. With the expectation of profit, primarily from the efforts of others.    Complex concepts  Let's call it the 'DAO Test', perhaps. Tongue-in-cheek statements aside, it's important for investors to possess a high-level understanding of the legal concepts involved in token investing.  It's also critical not to lose sight of the dangers and pitfalls of interpreting the complexities of the law too casually.  Or, as Santori framed the issue with specific reference to the SEC report:  ""A lot of token sales pass this test. A lot of them don't. And that's important to realize. Folks who look at this thing and say. 'Oh. It looks like a security. It smells like a security. It must be a security … Walk away from them. That's arm-chairing lawyering at its worst. Some of these things are securities – some of these things are not.""

As CoinDesk reported last week, police in Greece moved to arrest Alexander Vinnik, whom they accused of laundering roughly $4 billion through BTC-e, including funds connected to the now-defunct Japanese bitcoin exchange Mt Gox. U.S. prosecutors later unveiled a raft of charges against BTC-e and Vinnik, and a $110 million fine was handed down from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).  Amidst these developments, however, the only statements to emerge from BTC-e was a single tweet on July 26, which pledged that the site would return to working order in the next five to 10 days.  Roughly five hours ago, however, in a statement on the Bitcoin Talk forum (that was tweeted out via its official account), representatives for the exchange issued new comments, including a pledge to return users' funds.  The statement read:  ""For all those who buried us, I will remind you that the service has always worked on trust and we are ready to answer for it. The funds will be returned to everyone!""  The message also confirmed that BTC-e's data center had been raided by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation on July 25, during which time the agency ""seized all equipment, the servers contained databases and purses of our service.""  Notably, the statement pushed back on claims that Vinnik was an employee of BTC-e, with the operators stating: ""officially declare – Alexander was never the head or employee of our service."" In announcing the charges against Vinnik, the US Department of Justice had asserted that he was the ""operator"" of BTC-e.  The BTC-e statement went on to say that more information would be released in the next two weeks, including an account of ""how much money fell into the hands of the FBI and what amount of funds is available for return.""

42427645,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL2lVh,1501502409,Public Company to Convert Bitcoin to Stock in First-of-Its-Kind Fundraise,"As initial coin offerings (ICOs) start to come under regulatory scrutiny in the U.S., one Australian venture capital firm is experimenting with a new way to convert cryptocurrency into regulated corporate shares.  Following a decision to offer a 300,000 Australian dollar ($239,000) convertible bitcoin loan to money-transfer startup DigitalX, investment firm Blockchain Global Limited has revealed exclusively to CoinDesk that it has completed its due diligence and will close the entire AU$4.35 million investment in bitcoin.  However, what distinguishes the deal from past startup investments using bitcoin is that, following a series of unusual events, DigitalX is now a publicly listed company that trades under the ticker symbol DCC on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX).  As such, Blockchain Global CEO Sam Lee believes the completion of the deal will mark a milestone in cryptocurrency history.  He told CoinDesk:  ""With our due diligence process satisfied, we look forward to completing the AU$4.35 million transaction entirely in bitcoin, a world's first for a listed public company.""  The decision to invest in that firm that is using blockchain to simplify money-transfer comes after a due diligence period that initiated in June with a disclosure on the ASX site detailing the terms of the loan. Under the terms, Blockchain Global was given the option to covert the AU$300,000 into shares or receive repayment plus 12 percent interest one year after the drawdown of the loan.  Now that DigitalX has passed the due diligence process, the investor firm has opted to convert the entire bitcoin investment into shares, and has asked that the interest on the initial loan be paid in bitcoin.    ""Conducting transactions via bitcoin guarantees that the transfer is near instant,"" said Lee. ""And is transparent to the public in addition to the parties involved.""    A new precedent?  Since first posting the terms of its convertible bitcoin loan online, DigitalX CEO Leigh Travers told CoinDesk he's been contacted by several ""investor relations departments of major blockchain companies"" with questions about how they can do the same.  It turns out, it's not actually that difficult. But, to understand how the bitcoin loan was executed, it's important to grasp a bit about DigitalX's unusual background.  Back in March 2014, DigitalX became Australia’s first listed bitcoin company following the reverse takeover of ""dying oil and gas firm"" Macro Energy. The cash-rich company acquired DigitalX (then called Digital CC), but gave more shares to the acquiring company than the original shareholders had, resulting in a shift of control.  Then in August 2016, following news that Macro Energy's original founder had been indicted for fraud, shares in DigitalX plummeted, resulting in the company distancing itself even further from the founder, according to an Australian Financial Review report.  It was after a brief stint as a bitcoin mining operation that the startup pivoted to focus on developing a money-transfer app called Airpocket that used blockchain technology.  And it's at this point in the startup's story where the unusual capital raise, and bitcoin loan, come into play.  Inside a bitcoin convertible loan  Following the reverse acquisition, the company had gone from what Travers described as having ""a low number of shares issued and with cash in the bank"" to having ""a low amount of working capital."" But along the way, he said he's never doubted the blockchain market and DigitalX's ability to gain marketshare.  Still, to bridge its funding gap, DigitalX announced in June it had received an agreement to invest from Blockchain Global and other investors, but that the majority of the infusion was subject to due diligence and shareholder approval.  During this period, DigitalX needed cash – in a hurry – to maintain its operations. So, using Tradeblock's XBX reference rate to determine price, the loan was made, without middlemen, directly from the lender to the borrower.  Corporate advisors Ironside Capital Pty Ltd are helping manage the investment process for a 6 percent fee.  While bitcoin loan platforms such as Nebeus and Bitcoin Lending Club do exist, Travers said the direct method provided a series of additional benefits. This included the ability to complete the transaction on a national holiday, nearly instantly, and because the loan was visible on the bitcoin blockchain, to do so without the need for a receipt.  ""Within the hour we were able to register that those funds had been transferred to use and had been cleared,"" said Travers. ""So we were able to move onto the next part of the transaction.""  From a lender perspective, Lee said the transaction was equally streamlined. Now that the decision to invest has been made, all that remains to do is to receive shareholder approval.  Lee concluded:    ""Conducting transactions via bitcoin guarantees that the transfer is near instant, and is transparent to the public in addition to the parties involved.""

42427653,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL2lhh,1501498808,Legal Experts Warn of Coming Crackdown on Token Exchanges,"As the blockchain community grapples with the fallout from recent regulatory actions, legal experts are warning more enforcement measures could be on the horizon – and that token exchanges are a probable target.  To recap, last week saw the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rule that a defunct blockchain-based token called The DAO constituted an unregistered security. Just hours later, the Department of Justice and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) levied a $110 million penalty against BTC-e and arrested one of its founders – actions that struck an exchange that had long openly flouted the law.  The timing seemed hardly a coincidence, and at a blockchain industry conference in Washington, D.C., on Friday, Carol Van Cleef, a fintech attorney at Baker Hostetler, affirmed that she believes the two events are likely to be closely linked.  Van Cleef told the audience:  ""These were not isolated events. This was a rather carefully coordinated governmental action. I am absolutely certain that the timing of the release of the [SEC] investigative report was intentional. The SEC wanted to have it out there.""  Of particular note is that the SEC's ruling went so far as to state that trading platforms are specifically ""not exempt"" from securities regulations.  Taken in conjunction with the recent shutdowns of the AlphaBay and Hansa dark web marketplaces, Van Cleef said, the actions suggest that U.S. authorities are taking a much closer look at cryptocurrencies and are becoming better at coordinating inter-agency efforts with regard to enforcement.  Exchanges beware  Also speaking at the event was Jerry Brito, executive director of non-profit industry advocacy group Coin Center, who noted that a key component of the SEC report was its focus on the secondary exchanges that trade the tokens after an initial coin offering, or ICO, concludes.  ""These tokens, once the offering has happened, are trading on secondary markets. And if ICOs are securities, and there are markets that allow for the trading of securities, those are securities markets that need to be registered with the SEC and comply,"" he said.  Brito said that the ruling amounted to a ""warning shot"" to exchanges that trade ICO tokens, and suggested that a further crackdown on these exchanges is plausible, if not likely.  ""I think that, to the extent that there will be an enforcement action in the future, I could imagine the SEC – rather than going ICO by ICO – just going after a couple of the exchanges that may be providing the liquidity,"" he said.  Drew Hinkes, an attorney with Berger Singerman in Fort Lauderdale, suggested that consumers and traders should ""be wary"" of third-party exchanges that have not registered with the SEC.  He said that, to the best of his knowledge, few, if any, have yet done so:  ""Third-party exchanges are the engine that make the ICO economy run, and if you see them go down, you may not just lose all of your holdings but you may actually see the ICO markets crater as well.""  Following the trail  Also on display was the belief that these actions would now be easier for U.S. agencies, now that some enforcement actions have been taken.  Van Cleef, for instance, noted that the action against BTC-e, which also included a $12 million fine handed down to its alleged founder, had distinct characteristics linking it back to earlier cases such as Silk Road and collapsed exchange Mt Gox.  She said:  ""Once the investigations start, there is a treasure trove in every place that leads to another treasure trove of data, and you could see that winding through the BTC-e indictment.""  What's notable is that FinCEN enforcement orders like the one levied against BTC-e are almost always arrived at via negotiation by all parties involved. Yet, Van Cleef emphasized that this wasn't the case here – implying that the government was intentionally sending a louder-than-normal warning shot.  ""There was no negotiation. There was probably no conversation in advance of this action,"" she said, emphasizing that the criminal statute in play was that of operating as an unregistered money service business without being licensed as a money transmitter.  She continued:  ""The message to take away from this is ... if you touch U.S. residents and do business with them, you are required to be registered as money service business with FinCEN.""  ICO warning  At the D.C. event, speakers agreed that companies or individuals engaging in the issuance or trading of ICO tokens should be extra cautious – irrespective of the form of the token in question.  ""I would not count on lightning not striking twice. If you do something flagrant, I would not count on the SEC to keep their hands off,"" Hinkes said.  In this way, Hinkes sought to call upon entrepreneurs who are enticed by the novel funding method to think twice before pursuing a token offering.  Already, the funding method has come under scrutiny, even within the industry, with technologists citing the early stage nature of blockchains, and lawyers long cautioning against the sometimes cavalier embrace of the possibilities of ICOs.  Hinkes concluded:  ""If people are contributing money to a venture and folks are expecting a return in some form, you might have a security and you should absolutely consult with counsel.""

Called NextBlock Global, the new firm will focus on investments in the digital asset space. In statements, the fund's backers described the round as oversubscribed – a perhaps unsurprising state of affairs given recent interest from investors in vehicles tied to the blockchain industry.  Tapscott, who penned ""Blockchain Revolution"" with his father Don Tapscott, said in a statement:  ""We saw tremendous demand from institutional and strategic investors who are looking to get exposure to this new asset class. NextBlock will immediately begin to deploy capital, giving investors diversified exposure to the most promising investments in this space.""  NextBlock Global joins a growing body of ventures aimed at capitalizing on growing interest in blockchain-based assets. As reported by CoinDesk, the operators of a regulated, Jersey-based bitcoin fund earlier this month closed a new $5 million fund aimed at investing in blockchain tokens and initial coin offerings (ICOs).  Other investors, including some long-time backers in the bitcoin space, have sought capital to invest in the ICO space. CoinDesk's Q1 State of Blockchain report noted that, in a first, more money has been invested in blockchain projects by way of ICOs compared to traditional venture capital this year.  Although it's not immediately clear which projects NextBlock will move to back, Tapscott suggested that the firm may cast a wide net as it looks for opportunities in the space.

Innovate UK – a nondepartmental public office aimed to promote innovation through grants and investments – announced last week that it is looking to award up to £8 million ($10.5 million) in grants to firms working on health initiatives.  The agency said in its notice:  ""The types of digital health projects we will fund include (but are not limited to) ... emerging digital health technologies with a demonstrated healthcare benefit, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, augmented reality, blockchain and the Internet of Things.""  Beginning today, and running until October 11, the competition is open only to firms based in the U.K., while other stipulations apply based on the scope of entrants' projects.  Notably, Innovate UK has funded blockchain projects in the past, including £248,000 that was awarded to an ethereum-based cross-border payment tool in April 2016.  The agency also launched a distributed ledger-focused competition in September of last year, which sought to grant as much as £15 million to related projects.

42379646,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KNvz,1501488318,More Welcome Than Warning? The DAO Ruling Could Transform Securities,"Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis and the author of CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to CoinDesk subscribers.      The blockchain world was rocked last week by the release of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's analysis of The DAO, the distributed organization set up to ""automatically"" manage the funding of ethereum apps, and which collapsed last year after an exploit in its code was unveiled.  While the conclusion that The DAO tokens were, in fact, securities and should have been registered as such was not in itself surprising, the statement marked the first time the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially issued an opinion on digital tokens.  Its conclusion was that just because an asset is on a distributed ledger does not mean it is exempt from security laws. In response, initial coin offering (ICO) issuers and investors have been sent scrambling to figure out how vulnerable they are to the long reach of US securities law.  The short-term impact on digital token issuance is likely to be sharp.  But there's something else going on here that will end up boosting blockchain development and injecting a welcome dose of innovation into securities issuance and regulation.  It's not so much that the SEC has officially determined that blockchain assets can be considered securities and therefore have to comply with the law. It's that blockchain assets can be considered securities at all.  And if blockchain assets can be considered securities, securities can be transformed into blockchain assets.  This takes the Delaware achievement (changing the law to allow registered businesses to issue securities on a blockchain) and magnifies it, sending a signal to all states that a federal regulator is willing to broaden its definition of acceptable transmission methods.  Gearing up  The SEC has authorized blockchain-based securities in the past, but requests have been sparse. It has also imposed improper activity fines on cryptocurrency businesses. So, it is no stranger to the technology, and has spent some time investigating both the potential and dangers.  This recent development is a notable step forward, however, in that it reveals what could be the beginning of a sea change in company finance and investment. Not only does it show a willingness to apply securities concepts to digital assets, it also heralds a broadening of what is understood by ""security.""  In addition, it sends a message to other jurisdictions that blockchain-based assets are not going away. Securities regulators around the world have been intensifying their efforts to catch up with the innovations while fulfilling their mandate of protecting investors. Guidance from the SEC is likely to help.  What's more, regulation that is sort of in sync across borders will boost support for a technology that is not location-bound.  Entrepreneurs and developers will have more confidence in their project's outlook knowing that it is compliant in multiple jurisdictions, with access to a broader pool of investors.  The impact need not be limited to new technology businesses. With the definition of ""security"" changing, traditional issuers could be tempted to step up trials of blockchain-based assets.  Far from suppressing innovation in the digital token space, the SEC statement – while limited in its initial scope – is likely to boost more serious experimentation, both within the blockchain sector and without.  It could even end up being what was needed to push the development of blockchain solutions for the trading of shares and bonds to a new level.

42379657,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KO9p,1501474539,Will Bitcoin Cash Impact the Bitcoin Price? Traders Split on Possible Fork,"Bitcoin traders may soon be able to bet on their preferred version of the blockchain.  As if a years-long debate over the network's technical roadmap wasn't dramatic enough, Tuesday could see yet another twist in bitcoin's scaling debate. That's when a group of miners and developers say they will go as far as to create an alternative network to prove bigger blocks are the best solution for increasing network capacity.  Called Bitcoin Cash (BCC), the effort will effectively fork bitcoin's existing software and transaction history, and in the process, give every bitcoin user new cryptocurrency tokens on a new blockchain with different rules.  Should users own 2 BTC, this means they'll now be able to claim 2 BCC on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain, a move that could generate millions of dollars in new value for traders.  Not without precedent, a similar event took place on ethereum last summer, when members of that community created a new cryptocurrency to protest a design decision by developers.  Yet if you were expecting that sort of uncertainty to be scaring away traders, according to Ripple gateway operator Rafael Olaio, the end result is anything but. Given the creation of the new network, Olaio and others expect traders to hold steady before claiming their new funds.  He told CoinDesk:  ""People want to double their coins. Nobody is selling bitcoin.""  Overall, analysts offered a variety of opinions on what could develop in the days and months ahead, commenting on what they believe could be the immediate and long-term impact of the creation of a new, widely traded cryptocurrency bearing resemblance to bitcoin.  However, it's important to note that not all traders believe Bitcoin Cash will meet this definition.  Arthur Hayes, founder of crypto derivatives trading platform BitMEX, for example, noted that ""theoretically"" the launch of Bitcoin Cash should cause bitcoin's price to drop. Still, he questions whether this indeed will happen given that, historically, traders have not been kind to assets that have attempted to fork away from bitcoin.  ""There have been many similar distributions based on bitcoin ownership that caused no such drop in price, including bitcoin clams, byteball, etc. I think the Bitcoin Cash distribution will have minimal to no impact on the bitcoin price,"" he said.  Hayes continued:  ""I don't believe most holders expect longevity of this chain past the point at which they immediately dump their 'free money' to purchase bitcoin.""  Consumer confusion  Perhaps the biggest concern among traders, however, was not how the two assets would compete given a level playing field, but what might happen if the market doesn't provide such equity.  Charles Hayter, co-founder of crypto exchange service CryptoCompare, for example, noted that he believes consumers may be misled by the option to choose between two competing coins – and he wasn't alone.  ""In the long term, these two variants will cause confusion with their similar naming which no doubt will cause some problems,"" he said.  Marc Van der Chijs, a Dutch serial entrepreneur and VC, noted that he believes bad actors may even maliciously seek to create confusion between the two assets as a way to profit.  ""I could imagine scammers selling people ‘bitcoin with a discount’ and then giving them BCC instead of BTC,"" he told CoinDesk. ""Those stories will make potential retail investors even more worried about buying their first coins.""  Because of issues like these, and others perhaps unforeseen, Van der Chijs said he expects the combined price of bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash to fall below $2,700, the average recent price of bitcoin as observed on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  ""Because of uncertainty, people may move from BTC and BCC to ETH or other coins. So, I don’t think this is good for the price of bitcoin,"" he said.  No ETC  Still, other market observers sought to stress that a bitcoin fork might be less competitive against the larger bitcoin cryptocurrency because of its entrenched network effect.  Unlike ethereum classic, which split off of an ethereum network that was less than a year into its operation, the argument goes that the BTC price will remain more robust simply because it already benefits from a wider network of stakeholders and more developed infrastructure.  ""Bitcoin is more like currency, not like ethereum. A lot of infrastructure such as payment services are built and implemented in many places already,"" said Takao Asayama, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Zaif.  Kevin Zhou, operator of crypto hedge fund Galois Capital, responded similarly, arguing that he believes the fork will be ""lopsided"" in how it allocates the underlying network effect between the two competing technologies.  Still, Zhou's comments suggest he sees this as a positive, potentially enabling existing bitcoin users to align more capital with their preferred technical specifications.  ""This kind of differentiation allows capital to selectively enter into either side without buying the combined package where it may not have entered,"" he said.  What to expect  As for what could happen now, it seems it's anyone's guess.  While miners and developers are claiming a desire to go through with the split, it's still possible that the code necessary to create the break won't be introduced at all. Others worry that if it does go through, it could usher in a period of high volatility that, while benefitting advanced traders, turns off more casual investors.  Investor Vinny Lingham, long known for his bitcoin price predictions, indicated that he'd be keeping most of his capital out of the markets ahead of what he expects will be a ""turbulent few months"" for the protocol.  ""High risk equals high reward but also chance of portfolio damaging losses. I don't like what I'm seeing so I'm going to sit on the sidelines a bit longer,"" he said.  As for practical advice, Zhou, like others, stressed that traders who want to take part in any trading should withdraw their bitcoin from exchanges on the off-chance they aren't offering support for the new cryptocurrency.  While he recommended this as the fastest way to ""dump BCC,"" the advice is still useful for bitcoin traders who want to speculate along partisan lines.  Zhou concluded:  ""I'd recommend getting your BTC off exchanges.""
