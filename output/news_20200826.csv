42384551,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAcnNN,1598478106,Unconfiscatable? Using Bitcoin to Resist Police Extortion in Nigeria,"Nigerian programmer Adebiyi David Adedoyin hears knocking at his apartment door. He’s just woken up and headed to the bathroom. He decides to take his time. He'll answer in a minute.      But the knocking grows louder – and more urgent.      Inching open the bathroom door, Adedoyin sees someone clawing open his apartment window.      ""Someone's there,"" a voice says.      It's probably the police trying to break in, he realizes, from all the stories he's heard.      Adedoyin is sure he hasn't done anything wrong. But with the Nigerian police, that doesn't matter. He still might need to brace for trouble.      As he thinks through what to do next, Adedoyin is thankful a chunk of his money is stored in bitcoin. His crypto wallet is in a hiding spot the officers probably won't think to check. That means they're less likely to steal it.    Police corruption    While there are many principled police officers in Nigeria who help tackle crimes, police corruption is pervasive. Many Nigerian police are known for extorting and even sometimes torturing citizens rather than helping them solve legal quandaries.      ""Right there in the bathroom, where I was in my boxers with just my phone, AirPods and pack of cigarettes, I could hear them shouting for me to come open the door,"" Adedoyin told CoinDesk.      This is a well-documented phenomenon in Nigeria. Over the past several years, an online social media movement has emerged against the police. On Twitter, people use the hashtag #EndSARS to publicize the poor treatment they've received from police. SARS stands for Special Anti-Robbery Squad, which is a particularly brutal and mistrusted wing of the Nigerian police force.      Human rights research organization Human Rights Watch released a 102-page report outlining the abuses in painful detail in 2010.      ""Human Rights Watch's research revealed that people refusing to pay bribes are routinely subjected to arbitrary arrest, unlawful detention and threats until they or their family members negotiate payment for their release. Extortion-related confrontations between the police and motorists often escalate into more serious abuses. The evidence suggests that police officers have on numerous occasions severely beaten, sexually assaulted, or shot to death ordinary citizens who failed to pay the bribes demanded,"" the report reads.    Tricks and strategies    Adedoyin notes that Nigerians have to develop their own tricks to avoid police extortion, especially the younger Nigerians who are the main targets. Some people walk along different routes to avoid walking near the police.      ""Now it’s up to each person to prevent oneself from entering such situations,"" he said.      The practice is common enough that Adedoyin has been extorted by police officers more than once, and his friends have, too.      Corrupt police officers take their detainee's phone. They scan through it looking for SMS or email messages signalling how much money the detainee has in the bank.      If the police officer finds the detainee doesn't have any money, they're less likely to waste their time.      Locked in the bathroom, Adedoyin rapidly scrolls through his most recent messages, deleting any bank statements or emails showing how much money he has.      The bathroom door lock breaks.      Adedoyin is confronted by four police officers, all carrying guns. One slaps Adedoyin and asks him why he didn't come open the door. As Adedoyin expected, another officer snatches his phone and scans through for any grain of evidence that Adedoyin has money.      Adedoyin didn't have time to delete everything. The officer finds some evidence of how much money he makes. They finally let him go once he pays.    Where using bitcoin comes in    It was a bad experience. But Adedoyin is happy that his bitcoin trick worked – most of his money is still safe.      ""The money they collected to let me go in that case would have been a lot more if I had more money in my account. But I had most of my money in bitcoin,"" Adedoyin said.      Why does using bitcoin help in this situation? Adedoyin's ploy is to pretend that he doesn't have much money to extort. His solution is to store his money in a bitcoin wallet instead of in a bricks-and-mortar bank. Since bitcoin's less common, it's less likely the police officers find it.      Put another way, he's not putting his money into bitcoin as a safeguard because of its decentralization properties. Rather, he just thinks police officers are far less likely to look for a crypto balance than a fiat balance to see if he's ripe for extortion.      ""[The officers] don’t think to check [bitcoin] wallet apps, because most of them don’t even know what bitcoin is and even think bitcoin is a scam,"" Adedoyin said.      The second reason he has bitcoin is he hopes the price will keep rising. Like many other bitcoiners in the region, he sees it as an investment that might pay off in the future.      But for now, he keeps most of his money in bitcoin as security against the next time the police come banging on his door.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING | RESEARCH,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/08/26/unconfiscatable-using-bitcoin-to-resist-police-extortion-in-nigeria,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0e0ecdae4b924438226a2a46ebbb980b5bc76ed8-1200x675.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384561,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAcnWB,1598474701,How the Battle for Thailand Is Being Fought on Twitter,"Thailand’s protests highlight the vulnerabilities of major social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook.      Thai residents began protesting the nation's military regime earlier this year, giving voice to frustrations that have been building since a 2014 coup. The protestors are using social media platforms to help organize their efforts, but while these platforms are relatively decentralized compared to traditional media outlets, they are still subject to government interference. Even as activists rely on these tools in their struggle against the government, they fear that those same platforms are being used against them.      Facebook has blocked access inside Thailand to a group that criticized Thai King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun. The blocking of the group, which has over 1 million members, was at the request of Thai authorities. Now, Facebook is planning legal action against the Thai government to challenge the government’s request. Following the block, a new group criticizing the king swiftly appeared on the platform and has attracted at least 500,000 followers.      On Wednesday, Thailand's digital minister Puttipong Punnakanta told Reuters that authorities will continue the internet crackdown, adding that if protesters create new groups the government will have them blocked too. The minister also said that Facebook had complied with all orders from Thai officials, and he did not see the social media giant going through with its plans to take legal action challenging the government's request. (Thai officials did not respond to a request for comment by press time.)      Facebook is only part of the story, however. There are also questions about Twitter, a platform that has become central to the current movement. Some young Thai protesters are concerned Twitter might also be manipulated by Thailand’s military government, although they have not presented concrete evidence to support this.      The battle over social media is happening in the midst of unprecedented protests against the power of the Thai monarchy. Anti-government protests and rallies had taken place almost consistently since July, and on Aug. 16 at least 10,000 protesters called for the dissolution of Thailand’s military government and the reduction of the power of the King, a monarch who had previously been beyond criticism.    Hashtags    Thai protesters are trying to get their hashtags on Twitter’s trending list to bring global visibility to their cause. In the last 30 days, six popular hashtags related to the movement including #FreeYOUTH, #SaveParit, #SavePanusaya, #หยุดคุกคามประชาชน (stop oppressing people) and #ขีดเส้นตายไล่เผด็จการ (roughly translated as “Draw the line here. Junta has to go”) have altogether amassed over 10 million tweets, according to data obtained through Sprout Social.      These hashtags support both the overall movement and individual protestors who have been arrested by the government.      Two days before the Aug. 16 rally, police arrested prominent student activist Parit Chiwarak for sedition because of his involvement in the “Free Youth” movement back in July. Before him, two more activists were arrested on the same charges. On Aug. 13, rumors started spreading across social media that Chirawak might be arrested. Leading up to his arrest the next day, the hashtag #SaveParit was tweeted out over 2.6 million times.      Read more: Global Protests Reveal Bitcoin’s Limitations      According to Midnight, a 17-year-old Thai student protester who uses a pseudonym because of safety concerns, Twitter is the preferred tool for young protestors. “The new generations in Thailand have Facebook accounts only for their relatives to see,” Midnight said in an email.      But Midnight and other protesters also worry the government is using social media platforms to manipulate trending topics and to monitor protesters. In fact, back in February, an activist who went by the user name “Niranam” or “Anonymous” on Twitter was arrested for inciting terrorism after he criticized the monarchy on the platform.      “We suspected that Twitter would reveal our identity to the government,” Midnight said.      Midnight was also concerned that a verified account set up in March 2020 called Twitter Thailand was tracking the activity of protesters on the platform.      The account’s bio says, “Welcome to the official Thailand Twitter account!”      Although the students have no proof this account is tracking their activity on Twitter, they still took action to protect themselves. Midnight blocked the account. Another student protester, 21-year-old university student Som, blocked it too. Some student activists like Midnight and Som appear on Twitter under aliases. Twitter did not immediately respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment.      “Most social media platforms are not that secure and we need to use other applications for chatting. It would be great if there is something similar to Twitter but as secure as Telegram,” Som said.    Call for Democracy    According to Som and Midnight, Thailand’s public is frustrated with its military government that came into power through a coup in 2014. Last year, King Vajiralongkorn issued a royal decree to bring two key army units under his control.      “The government had become so powerful (with their unfair constitution) and [uses] their power to arrest or even abduct people who disagree with them,” Som told CoinDesk via an email.      The protests against the regime gained new life this year when Thai youths and students joined the movement calling for democracy.      Read more: A WeChat Ban Should Be the Moment for Decentralized Tech. But It’s Not.      Brad Adams, Asia director for the Human Rights Watch, told CoinDesk that Thailand is a hierarchical society where young people are expected to bend to the will of adults. One catalyst in the recent protests, he said, was the sentiment among students that they no longer wanted to be told how to dress, or wear their hair or to be obedient.      “[The government is] hoping to turn parents against their children by appealing to their parents' more conservative values to try to tell their kids to stay home and be quiet. But that doesn't seem to be working,” Adams said.      The new political opposition, Adams added, was led by a younger generation of technophiles who connect better with the youth, and use technology in an effective and sophisticated way.    Platform manipulation    According to Som, the news about the protests mainly disseminated through social media and online platforms because there was little coverage on local TV or radio news. Thailand has a weak record on media freedom, ranking 140 out of 180 countries in the 2020 world Press Freedom Index by Reporters Without Borders. The military government has generally exercised strict control over national broadcast networks. Recently, protesters accused local print and broadcast media of being “preoccupied with trivial matters” instead of covering the pro-democracy movement.      “There are even some news agencies that are so biased that they always say bad things about anti-government sides,” Som said.      Som felt that if the state was indeed targeting activists online, Facebook left protesters – who generally had some personal information displayed on their profiles – more vulnerable while Twitter allowed room for more anonymity.      But there is another reason why Twitter is attracting young protesters: trending hashtags.      Som and Midnight joined the other Thai activists online in a concerted effort to get hashtags related to the protests into Twitter’s trending lists by tweeting news posts with the tags repeatedly and in large numbers. For instance, the hashtag #หยุดคุกคามประชาชน (stop oppressing people) was tweeted an average of 110,272 times a day in the last month.      In Som’s view, if the hashtags got on the trending list, there was a higher chance the media would write about it.      “Even better, if it gets to the worldwide 'trending', it would start getting some interest from international media and the world,” Som said.    Suspicious activity?    Som and other activists noticed something strange a couple of weeks ago: on Aug. 11, the day before Thai Queen Mother Sirikit’s birthday, the hashtag #คิดถึงยอดหฤทัยใจจะขาด (roughly translated to “missing my love so bad my heart is broken”) began trending on Twitter. The tag contained the first verse of a poem written for the Sirikit by her closest aide: There are rumors they had a complicated relationship, Som said.      The hashtag quickly rose to the top of Twitter’s local trending list for Thailand, until it mysteriously vanished from the list altogether. Twitter data show there were 654,351 tweets containing the hashtag on Aug. 11. On Aug. 12, the tag was sitting at #1 on the list, Som said. There were over 33,000 tweets with the tag. But by afternoon the tag was no longer on the list, Som said.      According to Adams, Thai authorities have been engaging in an organized effort to quell dissent on social media platforms.      “They mobilize people to attack protesters and activists online is a very organized attempt to intimidate and threaten political opponents. We don't know but most likely a lot of people and bots are getting paid to do that. It's a coordinated, fairly extensive programme to try to win the information war but win it in a dishonest way,” Adams said.      Som and Midnight also noticed similar trends with hashtags related to the protests, suddenly dropping ranks or falling out of trending lists.      According to angel investor and social media branding guru Dan Fleyshman, a social media platform can remove or censor any hashtag containing an expletive, and similarly, it can remove or throttle the reach of any hashtag quickly.      Read more: Hong Kong Citizens Turn to Stablecoins to Resist National Security Law      “The same way a government can request censorship/removal of a trending hashtag, they can also amplify a hashtag or specific post through paid media at scale. The government can also ask favors to their internal connections at the popular social media platforms, which can enhance the reach and spread propaganda,” Fleyshman said.      Twitter introduced a country-specific censorship initiative in 2012 to honor the “different ideas about the contours of freedom of expression” which allowed governments to request the “withholding” of tweets deemed culturally sensitive. Thailand was quick to publicly endorse the initiative.      But between 2012 and 2019, Thailand has only made six legal requests to Twitter with the aim of removing content, while for comparison, Saudi Arabia has made 765 requests in the same period.      According to Adams, unlike other countries that are shutting the internet down or using web disruptions to silence its public or control protests, Thailand most likely won’t resort to such measures. Thailand's commerce depends on the internet, it's a reasonably good investment destination and it has never been a country that has censored the internet, Adams said.      “I would imagine that if they were to censor the internet, they would start creating enemies among groups of people who right now are not enemies of the state and the government,” Adams said.      But in 2016, Thailand implemented the Computer-Related Crimes Act, which gave powers to the government to restrict free expression and take action against political opponents. The act also allowed the government to make the legal request to block the 1 million-strong Facebook group that criticized the monarchy.      Thai protestors are fighting to stay relevant among trending Twitter topics in the country, competing with promoted tags, or ones about gaming and Korean popular (K-pop) music. At 11:22 p.m. Thailand local time on August 24, the country’s 14th trending hashtag (with 57,400 people tweeting) was about an activist, Panupong Chadnok, who was arrested for a second time earlier in the day.      For Midnight and Som, the Twitter hashtag war and internet censorship are more reasons why they feel their country needs change.

42384554,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAcnOd,1598474040,Fed Chair Powell’s Jackson Hole Speech Could Hint at US Dollar’s Future,"A speech by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell scheduled for Thursday offers a reminder of just how dramatically once-slow-moving monetary forces have accelerated due to the devastating economic toll of the coronavirus pandemic.    LIVE: CoinDesk's Bradley Keoun and Nikhilesh De are covering Powell's speech on CoinDesk.com and Twitter. Follow our live coverage here.    This time last year, President Donald Trump was vehemently criticizing Powell on Twitter for setting interest rates too high, as U.S. economic growth slowed and the national debt swelled past $22 trillion.      This time last year, then-Bank of England Governor Mark Carney delivered a speech at the Fed’s annual Jackson Hole Economic Symposium in Wyoming warning the U.S. dollar’s status as the de facto global currency contributes to an unsustainable international economic and monetary regime. He argued that world leaders should create a “synthetic hegemonic currency,” potentially provided “through a network of central bank digital currencies.”      Fast forward to now, and the Jackson Hole conference has been forced to go virtual because of the coronavirus. Trump’s economic stewardship, including a U.S. stock market that many investors now say is propped up by the Fed’s $3 trillion of freshly printed money, has become a core issue in the 2020 presidential election. The national debt now stands at $26.5 trillion. Digital currencies are now being studied and pursued by central banks in China, the U.S. and just about everywhere else. Goldman Sachs recently warned the dollar risked losing its dominant reserve status.      “The pandemic has sped up key structural trends and triggered substantial market swings,” strategists for the $7 trillion money manager BlackRock wrote this week. “The policy revolution was needed to cushion the devastating and deflationary impact of the virus shock. In the medium term, however, the blurring of monetary and fiscal policy could bring about upside inflation risks.”      Read more: The Federal Reserve Is Experimenting With a Digital Dollar      As the spread of the coronavirus earlier this year triggered lockdowns and quarantines, the global economy this year entered its deepest recession since the early 20th century.      When markets from stocks to bitcoin swooned in March, the Fed slashed interest rates close to zero and has since announced plans to buy U.S. Treasury bonds in essentially unlimited amounts while providing emergency liquidity for money markets, Wall Street dealers and corporations.      “The road ahead is highly uncertain,” Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said Thursday in a speech in Kansas.    'No easy way out' for Powell    Many investors are betting on bitcoin as a hedge against the potential debasement of the U.S. dollar, but Fed officials say deflationary forces might be stronger because of an expected drop off in demand from consumers and households.      Analysts for Bank of America, the second-biggest U.S. bank, wrote earlier this week in a report that bond market traders expect the Fed to adopt a “major new policy framework aimed at better achieving its 2% target” for annual inflation. As of the last reading, the central bank’s preferred measure of consumer price increases registered just 0.9%, so the baseline expectation is the Fed would let inflation rise well above 2% so that the average over a long period of time gets closer to the target.      Read more: Bitcoin Risks Deeper Drop if Dollar Rebounds      “Let us be optimistic and say it takes three years to create some inflation,” Matt Blom, head of sales and trading at the digital-asset firm Diginex, wrote Wednesday in an email. “We would need to drive it above 3.5% and maintain it there for years before we are able to use an average calculation.”      It’s unclear what Fed scenario is already priced into the market, but Bank of America's Athanasios Vamvakidis, a foreign-exchange analyst, wrote that there is “no easy way out” for Powell and his colleagues.      “Without inflation eventually acting as a budget constraint, we see risks for recurring and worsening bubbles, with further divergence between Wall Street and Main Street,” Vamvakidis wrote.    What Powell’s speech could say about the dollar’s future    Crypto traders will focus in the short term on what the Fed’s speech might mean for bitcoin prices, which have surged almost 60% in 2020, far exceeding this year’s 7.7% year-to-date gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of U.S. stocks.      But the Fed’s actions could also have implications for ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, where entrepreneurs are developing alternative currencies and semi-autonomous lending and trading networks that might one day replace the current financial system. There’s also a fast-growing business in dollar-linked “stablecoins,” with the amount doubling this year to $13 billion.      Read more: Fed Reserve Analysts Say Common Digital Currency Distinction ‘Problematic’      “So much has changed,” said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of the cryptocurrency-focused hedge fund BitBull Capital. “There is this danger of the U.S. [dollar] in the future no longer being the world's reserve currency. We are in a much worse position than we were in a year ago.”      Mati Greenspan, founder of the cryptocurrency and foreign-exchange analysis firm Quantum Economics, wrote this week that Powell’s return to Jackson Hole comes at a time when “people are just starting to ask questions about the intrinsic value of money.”      “U.S. authorities have just taken on an inordinate amount of debt, more than they could possibly ever hope to pay back,” Greenspan wrote. “So the only viable option is to decrease the value of that debt by way of monetary debasement. It's despicable and dangerous, but the only other option is austerity, which is too unpopular for any public servant to mention at this time.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/08/26/fed-chair-powells-jackson-hole-speech-could-hint-at-us-dollars-future,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/68fc3616c723a1d139816385e894d725441eca3a-1200x651.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $11,467 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 1.2% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $11,102-$11,593.  BTC above its 10-day moving average but below the 50-day, a sideways-turning-bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price was able to hold above $11,100 Wednesday, going as low as $11,102 before jumping as high as $11,593.      Read More: Bitcoin Drop Squeezes Out Weak Derivatives Positions      Katie Stockton, analyst at Fairlead Strategies, sees $10,000 as a lower bound in trading because the world’s oldest cryptocurrency lacks market momentum. “The pullback in bitcoin appears healthy,” Stockton noted. “That said, there is room for further near-term downside with support in the $10,000-$10,055 area, where there was once resistance, and room to short-term oversold territory.”      Jean Baptiste Pavageau, a partner at quantitative trading firm ExoAlpha, says bitcoin continues to be affected by gains in alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins. Indeed, one way to measure this is looking at bitcoin’s dominance, which hit a 2020 low of 60.26% in August.      ”The flattishness of the bitcoin price since the beginning of August allowed the altcoin market cap to grow quickly with an inflow from bitcoin traders toward altcoins,” said Pavageau.      However, two key events looming over the balance of this week might increase bitcoin market action. One is Thursday’s speech from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. “The key thing to watch from Powell’s speech tomorrow is the possible shift of the inflation target from a unique figure, like 2%, to a range such as 1.75%-2.25%,” said Chris Thomas, head of digital assets for Swissquote Bank. “This would create a dovish feel to the market and we’d likely see some dollar weakness.”      Another event is the expiration of 65,000 BTC options, over $700 million at current market values, on Friday. The vast majority of these options are on crypto derivatives platform Deribit.      “We may see some volatility as a few traders try to push the futures market towards the $11,000 or $12,000 strike,” said Swissquote’s Thomas, adding, “$11,000 would be a buying opportunity and $12,000 we’d likely see further selling.”      Read More: Fidelity’s Chief Strategist Starts Bitcoin Index Fund    Value locked in DeFi at $7B    Ether (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Wednesday, trading around $386 and climbing 1.4% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

Over 4.8 million ETH and 49,248 BTC is currently “staked” in various DeFi services, gaining a percentage profit or “yield” in return.      Vishal Shah, founder of crypto derivatives platform Alpha5, says DeFi’s opportunities are captivating the interest of traders, and perhaps creating some brand-new ones. “Derivatives traders naturally look for complex risk to exploit, and, by comparison to DeFi, typical derivatives instruments are quieter,” Shah said. “I think the nuanced specifics of DeFi are probably even giving rise to a new breed of derivative traders.”      Read More: What to Make of the SEC’s New Accredited Investor Rules    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly green Wednesday.

While CEO, Blockware Solutions became one of the largest distributors of mining rigs to the U.S. market, according to the company.      In 2019 he co-founded the bitcoin mining fund Blockware Mining, LLC and served as the company's CEO.

Such flexibility could be of particular use for NASA's budding army of tiny drones moving in tandem, the SCRAMBL project proposal said. NASA is currently spending billions on an octocopter mission to Saturn.  As pointed out by the two firms, quadcopter swarms need to stay nimble in inhospitable environments, where communication is spotty but operational awareness remains paramount.

""Wise Origin Bitcoin Index Fund I, LP"" has a $100,000 minimum buy-in and a high-ranking executive officer to boot: Peter Jubber, head of strategy and planning for the increasingly crypto-friendly investments giant Fidelity.  Disclosed in a Wednesday morning filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the fund is the latest example of Wall Street veterans warming up to bitcoin. Fidelity, one of the largest mutual fund firms in the U.S., is also leading the Street in bitcoin research and services.  Wise Origin links back to Fidelity Investments via Jubber and Fidelity's brokerage service and distribution subsidiaries, both of which are set to receive sales compensation from the new fund. It also shares a Boston office building with Fidelity.  Fidelity declined to comment on its ties to the fund. A Delaware corporation called FD Funds GP is Wise Origin's general partner, and Jubber is FD Funds' president.  While it is not known how the fund will approach bitcoin investing, Jubber waxed bullish on blockchain in a 2017 podcast sponsored by Fidelity. At the time he said his firm had sketched out 10 years of potentialities for the institution-disrupting tech.  ""Every incumbent should be spending time and money on this topic to understand it, at least to understand the threat,"" he said in the podcast. ""But I think there's just a massive opportunity.""

42384544,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAYU69,1598458091,"Blockchain Bites: Major Acquisitions, Bitcoin Futures Liquidations and the SEC's New Rules","FTX acquired Blockfolio, ConsenSys acquired Quorum and police have seized the third-largest exchange in South Korea. And news broke the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formalized new ""accredited investor"" rules.      You’re reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they’re significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.    Breaking news    The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally adopted new accredited investor rules, expanding the group of Americans who can invest in private securities.      The new definition, which lets individuals holding certain licenses meet the definition of “accredited investor,” was released for public comment in December 2019.      Accredited investors in the U.S. – which currently include individuals who have a net worth of more than $1 million, annual income greater than $200,000 or entities that meet certain legal requirements – have access to private financial markets the broader public does not.      Still, the move isn’t broadly expanding the list of individuals who can take part in the private markets. Zachary Kelman, a partner at Kelman Law, told CoinDesk shortly after the proposal was unveiled in December that “Wall Street insiders” and similar individuals may benefit most.      Drew Hinkes, general counsel at Athena Blockchain, similarly told CoinDesk at the time that more clarity was needed on what type of credentials might qualify individuals to become accredited investors.      “The proposed modernization would appear to include persons who are licensed to sell securities but who otherwise did not previously qualify to buy private placements as accredited,” he told CoinDesk via Telegram.      Though this may not grow the investor pool by that much, he noted.    Top shelf    Retail acquisitions Derivatives exchange FTX has acquired Blockfolio in a $150 million cash, crypto and equity deal. Discussions began nine months ago, and play into FTX’s vision of becoming a retail and mobile-friendly exchange. Antigua and Barbuda-based FTX is ranked first by order-book liquidity and seventh by 24-hour volume, having been founded last year, CoinDesk’s Zack Voell reports. Blockfolio, founded in 2014, has six million cumulative downloads and sees 150 million impressions on its news and portfolio tools.      Exchange hosed Meanwhile, Coinbit, South Korea’s third-largest cryptocurrency exchange, appears to have been seized by police over allegations it faked most of its trading volume, CoinDesk EU News Editor Daniel Palmer reports. Exchange insiders and police said up to 99% of the platform’s trading volume was ""manipulated,” or washed, using “ghost” accounts – totalling over 100 billion won ($84 million) in faked income. Seoul Newspaper, which broke the news, said it had seen the books and that 99% of recorded trades could not be associated with deposits or withdrawals.      Acquire, invest, interoperate? ConsenSys will acquire Quorum, the enterprise blockchain platform developed by JPMorgan Chase, with the mega-bank becoming a customer of ConsenSys. All enterprise work being done at ConsenSys will now fall under the new “ConsenSys Quorum” brand, and ConsenSys plans to merge its existing protocol engineering roadmap with Quorum, including locking down interoperability between the other enterprise Ethereum client Hyperledger Besu. Also announced, JPMorgan has made an undisclosed strategic investment in ConsenSys, which is in the process of raising funds, CoinDesk’s Ian Allison reports.      $1B Ethereum exploit Over $1 billion worth of tokens on the Ethereum blockchain are missing a software standard released in 2017, setting them up to be hijacked and drained from trading exchanges, according to new research. The vulnerability, called a fake deposit exploit, was pinpointed in 7,772 issuers of ERC-20 tokens, according to several university researchers. A hacker can fraudulently siphon exorbitant amounts of funds at nearly no cost by manipulating code in the smart contracts of ERC-20 tokens listed on cryptocurrency exchanges with deficient transaction verification methods.      Darknet down Top darknet site Empire Market has been offline for more than three days, prompting fears of an exit scam. According to a Tuesday report by Darknetstats, the site, the most trafficked darknet marketplace, was taken offline on August 22. John Marsh, a Darknetstats representative, raised concerns Empire’s administrators could have absconded with an estimated 2,638 bitcoin ($30.2 million). Empire Market admin Se7en dispelled the rumors. There’s plenty of speculation, but nothing ""concrete"" about what has happened to the site, CoinDesk’s Sebastian Sinclair reports.

The special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), Ribbit LEAP Ltd., filed a prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Tuesday, only mentioning cryptocurrency twice in passing, in passages that describe Ribbit Capital's range of investments.      Unlike traditional publicly traded companies, where major acquisitions are subject to shareholder approval, a SPAC asks for wide latitude to make purchases (hence the term ""blank check""), CoinDesk Executive Editor Marc Hochstein reports.      ""Our shareholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our proposed initial business combination, which means we may complete our initial business combination even though a majority of our shareholders do not support such a combination,"" warns the risk factors section of the Ribbit Leap prospectus.      Ribbit has led a seed round for Bobby Lee's Ballet crypto wallet startup in 2019, and invested in Coinbase, Revolut, Robinhood, Xapo, Chainalysis, Figure Technologies and CRB Group.      While it’s unclear how much Ribbit Leap will focus on crypto or blockchain acquisitions, the filing comes at a time of renewed exuberance in the sector. Aside from the bull run in coin prices, fledgling exchange INX Ltd. has launched an on-chain regulated initial public offering, and heavyweights Coinbase and Ripple are reportedly eyeing public listings.    Market intel    Futures liquidated Bitcoin’s latest price drop to $11,400 has forced out weak hands in the derivatives market, according to CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole. The top cryptocurrency by market value fell by over 3.5% to levels near $11,100 on Tuesday, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index, triggering sell liquidations worth nearly $50 million in futures contracts listed on cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX. “The positives of last night's move was that it cleared out a lot of the weak leverage longs,” Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a Telegram post, in reference to the perpetuals liquidations.      Bet on decentralization The fast-growing realm of decentralized finance – semi-autonomous exchanges and lenders erected from interconnected systems of digital tokens and coding atop the Ethereum blockchain – is one of the hottest corners of the crypto industry this year, with $7 billion of value locked, a 10-fold increase over the start of 2020. Now, the big centralized crypto exchanges are finding a way to cash in on the mania, introducing indexes tied to the fate of “DeFi” tokens and new futures contracts and other types of derivatives. For traders, these indexes provide a way to speculate on decentralized finance without going all in on any single project.    Tech pod    Wrap it up? Digital asset trust company BitGo is considering building an Ethereum sidechain for wrapped bitcoin (WBTC), amid historic highs in Ethereum fees. CTO Ben Chan said the company is “reaching out” to community partners to build an alternative for its popular product, an ERC-20 token with a 1-1 peg to bitcoin, which has become a key component of the decentralized finance space. BitGo currently secures some 46,000 BTC (~$500 million) through a custodial patchwork and is not “committed to anything in 2020.” Ethereum fees peaked on Aug. 13, with little sign of abating.      No government! Liquity is a DeFi project that wants to launch without token governance, CoinDesk’s Brady Dale reports. It has started running ideas for farming schemes by its early supporters, ahead of its stablecoin mint that works much like MakerDAO, lending against collateral with a low-volatility token. Notably, Liquity’s smart contract will adjust as needed without a governance committee of token-holding people. “All of the system parameters are automatically controlled by the algorithms,” CEO Robert Lauko said.

Wednesday's move helps grow the pool of Americans who can compliantly invest in token sales.      Still, the move isn’t broadly expanding the list of individuals who can take part in the private markets. Zachary Kelman, a partner at Kelman Law, told CoinDesk shortly after the proposal was unveiled in December that “Wall Street insiders” and similar individuals may benefit most.      Andrew Hinkes, an attorney with Carlton Fields, similarly told CoinDesk at the time that more clarity was needed on what type of credentials might qualify individuals to become accredited investors.

Read more: Closer Look at SEC ‘Accredited Investor’ Revamp Suggests Little Will Change      Indeed, as Hinkes pointed out, the SEC itself acknowledges the expanded definition might not grow the pool of accredited investors that much. The document released Wednesday states:    “We do not expect that number of newly eligible individual accredited investors to be significant compared to the number of individual investors that currently are eligible to participate in private offerings, and (2) we expect the amount of capital invested by such newly eligible individual investors to have minimal effects on the private offering market generally.”    The document indicates that only individuals with Series 7, 65 or 82 certifications would qualify for now.

Marathon will acquire Fastblock for 8,658,009 common shares, currently trading around $2.48, giving the deal a total value of about $22 million.  After deploying Fastblock’s 3,304 ASIC miners, Marathon’s mining power will increase by 208 petahash per second, according to the announcement.  Marathon also said the deal will cut its overall cost to mine bitcoin (BTC) from $7,400 per BTC to $3,600 per BTC due to the lower-than-industry-standard electricity cost of $0.0285 per KwH.  Fastblock has been “actively seeking a partner that could help us build one of the largest bitcoin mining companies in North America,” according to Fastblock CEO Bernardo Schucman.  Schucman will stay on with Marathon after the deal and become its head of mining operations.  Marathon said it will work with Fastblock’s management team to expand the current power capacity in Fastblock's Atlanta facility from of 15MwH to 45MwH. The facility may be expanded up to a maximum of 100MwH of power should Marathon's expansion efforts require additional power, the company said.  The acquisition is the latest move in Marathon's push to rapidly expand its mining operations in light of the recent runup in BTC. On Monday, Marathon announced its receipt of 1,300 new mining machines –⁠ WhatsMiner M31S+ and S19 Pros –⁠ with 1,000 additional S19 Pros expected to arrive by December.

Announced Wednesday, the Microsoft-backed project – developed by Paul Brody, blockchain lead at EY, and John Wolpert of ConsenSys – made the first version of its code available to contributors to augment, as part of the OASIS open-source project, clearing the way for standards development.      Baseline uses Ethereum only for hashing and ordering events, like a kind of middleware. The way enterprise blockchains typically work is by running data on-chain like a traditional workhorse database – a grave error of judgment, according to Wolpert.      The protocol has seen prolific adoption since its launch in March of this year. Wolpert said some 20 or so companies a week are joining the 600-plus firms now using the protocol, with big names like Coca-Cola bottling group Coke One North America recently joining.      Read more: Microsoft, EY and ConsenSys Tout New Way for Big Biz to Use Public Ethereum      Wolpert is outspoken on the subject of enterprise blockchains and why “Baselining” is proving to be so popular among large corporations.      “I think because boring is the new exciting,” Wolpert quipped. “We have been trying to shill this idea of putting data on these shared databases for the past five years – and I had a hand in that, too. Well, turns out it’s a bit like the emperor’s new clothes.”      “Baselining,” the verb, can massively reduce capital expense and other overheads, said Wolpert, while increasing operational integrity when automating business processes across multiple companies.    Next steps    Thus far, several proofs-of-concept have been released to showcase how to baseline systems such as SAP, Microsoft Dynamics and Google Sheets. The standards work commencing will be coordinated with the standards initiatives of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance’s Mainnet Working Group, Wolpert added.      Baseline has also established a technical steering committee that includes EY, Microsoft, ConsenSys, Splunk, MakerDAO, Duke University, Chainlink, Unibright, Envision Blockchain, Neocova, Core Convergence, Provide and W3BCloud.      Read more: How the EEA Made Ethereum Palatable to Big Business      The release of Baseline Protocol v1, Wolpert said, represents a significant milestone because it provides a set of standard interfaces for developers to implement solutions easily and for vendors to provide their own modules that comply with the specification. Official OASIS standards development based on the Baseline reference implementation will commence in September, according to a press statement.      “The protocol is at a stage where it is going into professional standards development,” Wolpert said. “Now people can really dig in and start contributing to it in a way that makes it is fairly straightforward.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | LINK | MINING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/08/26/boring-is-the-new-exciting-how-baseline-protocol-connected-with-600-corporates,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5b1e15742cdcd7840fa1b9c1dd977e4bab387a98-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384583,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAYU7P,1598449403,First Mover: Binance's New DeFi Futures Let Crypto Traders Bet on Decentralization,"Market Moves    The fast-growing realm of decentralized finance – semi-autonomous exchanges and lenders erected from interconnected systems of digital tokens and coding atop the Ethereum blockchain – is one of the hottest corners of the crypto industry this year, with $7 billion of value locked, a 10-fold increase over the start of 2020.      Now, the big centralized crypto exchanges are finding a way to cash in on the mania, introducing indexes tied to the fate of ""DeFi"" tokens and new futures contracts and other types of derivatives. For traders, these indexes provide a way to speculate on decentralized finance without going all in on any single project.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      The latest announcement comes from Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange.      The company plans to offer ""DeFi Index Perpetual Contracts,"" listed on Binance Futures, according to a press release Wednesday. The contracts will be denominated in the dollar-linked stablecoin tether and offer traders leverage up to 50 times their money down.      The ""fully synthetic derivative product enables greater access to decentralized finance,"" Binance said in the release.      Ahem. Never underestimate crypto exchanges' creativity when it comes to adapting Wall Street-style financial engineering for use on the so-called digital rails.      Binance's new contracts might be an early entrant in what could potentially become a crowded field.      Earlier this week, the exchange FTX announced a futures index tracking the top 100 liquidity pools on the decentralized exchange Uniswap. FTX had already launched its own DeFi Index in June.      “We've seen large demand from customers to get exposure to a broad base of DeFi products,” CEO Sam Bankman-Fried told CoinDesk's Zack Voell in a private message.      Binance's DeFi index consists of 10 tokens associated with DeFi, several of which rank among the year's best performers. They include Chainlink's LINK, Compound's COMP, Kyber's KNC, Aave's LEND, ZRX's 0x and MakerDAO's MKR.      In an example of the speculative fervor, tokens associated with the phenomenon now have a combined market value of $12.7 billion, more than the amount of money locked into the underlying platforms, according to the website DeFi Market Cap.      ""DeFi is still the big hype, with many coins still flying high,"" the Norwegian cryptocurrency analysis firm Arcane Research wrote Tuesday in a weekly report.      Messari, a crypto-markets research firm, has compiled its own list of 30 tokens associated with DeFi. On average, they're up 13-fold in 2020.      It almost makes bitcoin's 56% year-to-date gain look like dead money.    Bitcoin watch    Bitcoin’s latest price drop has a silver lining: It has forced out weak hands in the derivatives market and potentially opened the doors for a more sustainable rally to recent highs.    Bitcoin is currently trading near $11,400.  Tuesday's 3.7% price drop triggered sell liquidations – the forced unwinding of long trades – worth nearly $50 million in perpetuals (futures with no expiry) listed on cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, according to data source Skew.  “The positives of last night's move was that it cleared out a lot of the weak leverage longs,” Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a Telegram post, in reference to the perpetuals liquidations.  Following Tuesday’s price drop, the cost of holding long positions in BitMEX perpetuals, known as the “funding rate,” has normalized.  A high funding rate discourages new investors from entering the market and existing holders from boosting their long positions.  “The unsustainably high funding rate has been pushed back to its typical baseline levels of 11% annualized,” QCP Capital said.  The funding rate had jumped to highs above 60% in annualized terms on Aug. 18, when bitcoin broke above $12,000.  As a result, stronger buying pressure may emerge, leading to a re-test of recent highs above $12,000.

42421788,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXqZtF,1598448992,The NFT Game That Makes Cents for Filipinos During COVID,"In the early 1980s, anti-video game propaganda depicted zombie-like “vidiots” hypnotized by their Pac-Mans and their Space Invaders. Lured into the dank depths of the arcade, innocent teenagers were at risk of becoming addicted, flunking school to instead kill and destroy.  Fast forward to today and video games are recognized as a valuable tool to promote skills development. Microsoft’s Minecraft is used to demonstrate engineering principles and World of Warcraft has taught students about strategy and scientific concepts. Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have touted the educational benefits of video games, and Brock Pierce has credited his success in bitcoin to an early start in gaming.  Leah Callon-Butler, a CoinDesk columnist, is the Director of Emfarsis, a consulting firm based in Southeast Asia that represents play-to-earn sector clients including Animoca Brands, Yield Guild Games, Blockchain Game Alliance and others.  In the Philippines, one popular blockchain-based game is even providing pathways out of poverty and helping spread the word about novel technology. Created by Sky Mavis, a Vietnamese startup, Axie Infinity is a decentralized application (dapp) on the Ethereum blockchain where players breed, raise, battle and trade adorable digital critters called Axies.  See also: Andrew Thurman - NFTs Are Boring; Here’s How to Make Them Fun  Ijon Inton, an Axie player from Cabanatuan City, which is about 68 miles north of Manila in the province of Nueva Ecija, first learned about it in February of this year when his friend stumbled across an explainer video on YouTube. Intrigued by the “Play to Earn” element of the game, he decided to give it a go.  “At first I just want to try its legitimacy, and after a week of playing I was amazed with my first income,” said Inton, who is currently earning around 10,000 PHP ($206) per week from playing the game around the clock.  Inton soon invited his family to play, too, and after a few weeks, he also started telling his neighbors. A crypto trader since 2016, Inton helped his friends set up a Coins.ph account so they could buy their first ETH and get started. Now, there are more than 100 people in his local community playing to earn on Axie, including a 66-year-old grandmother.  It’s food on the table, it’s money for their families and it’s saving them when they cannot even leave the house.  The COVID-19 crisis, which has confined people to their homes and limited the usual opportunities to earn an income, combined with the compelling nature of the Axie game itself, has encouraged people who might not usually play with dapps to do just that.  “To a crypto investor, gaining $300 or $400 a month might not mean that much, but for these people it means the world,” said Gabby Dizon, the Filipino co-founder of mobile app development company Altitude Games. “It’s food on the table, it’s money for their families and it’s saving them when they cannot even leave the house during this pandemic.”  The game itself could be described as Pokémon meets CryptoKitties, the latter being the collectibles craze that attracted so much traffic to the Ethereum blockchain in late 2017 it brought the network to its knees.  Like CryptoKitties, Axies are non-fungible tokens (NFT) that are represented as cryptographically unique cartoon pets. They can’t be replicated, which makes them digitally scarce, and like Pokémon, they are born to battle. With their adorably plump little bodies and extraordinary features – one of mine has a chili pepper for a tail, another has half an eggshell on its head – they look like something of a fantasy-edition Mr. Potato Head.  There are a number of ways to make money with Axies. For new players, the most common method is by earning the utility token, small love potion (SLP), and selling it via a liquidity pool at the decentralized trading platform, Uniswap. Issued as a reward when Axies win battles, SLP is in demand because it’s required to get a couple of Axies in the mood to breed.  Chatting with me via Zoom, Inton explains how earning SLP became his full-time job. Before COVID-19, the plan was to move to Japan and take up a new career as a trainee butcher. This is a common story for many Filipinos. Faced with a lack of job opportunities, they are forced to leave their families and seek employment abroad.  Inton was due to fly out in May. But now, with international travel suspended, he is stranded back home in the province. Behind him, I can see his wife nursing their baby in one arm, and in the other she’s playing one-handed Axie on her mobile phone. Each day they play around 20 hours combined, taking it in shifts.  See also: Leah Callon-Butler - Is Crypto Fintech? It Depends Who You Ask  She does four hours in the afternoon and another six around midnight, while he plays in the morning for eight hours and another two before bed. Together, they can rack up around 1,500 SLP per day, while sharing the caring duties for their three children age six, four and 18 months. Currently, SLP is trading for under 2 PHP, but on June 8 it went as high as 11 PHP.  For more seasoned players, or those with greater risk appetite, higher returns can be made by trading the Axies themselves. Inton has dabbled in this space, breeding Axies and selling them for as much as 2,000 PHP ($41). Just last week, two very rare Axies were sold for 60 and 90 ETH. The highest price ever fetched for a single Axie currently sits at 110 ETH.  To put this kind of money into perspective: Since the first round of quarantine was enforced on the main island of Luzon, national unemployment has risen to an all-time high at 17.7% (compared to 5.1% a year ago) and GDP shrank 16.5% for the same period.  Further, with more than 100,000 overseas Filipino workers repatriated, the Asian Development Bank has estimated remittance losses somewhere between $31.4 billion and $54.3 billion this year. Last year, remittances made up over 10% of Philippine GDP – acting as a crucial lifeline for poor families, especially during a crisis.  This video game has captured the hearts and minds of an entire community in the rural Philippines – demonstrating a strong use case for dApps.  While the government has provided some assistance, it’s hardly enough to get by. Since March, the Inton family have received two relief payments totaling 13,000 PHP ($267). Their local barangay council has tried to help further by providing handouts of rice and canned sardines, but it’s only about a week’s worth of food delivered once a month. So the ability to supplement their income while housebound, is quite literally a lifesaver.  Jeffrey “Jiho” Zirlin, Axie Infinity’s Growth Lead, first discovered the Inton family’s story when he was doing a regular scan for bots to ensure no automated programs were gaming the system. He raised a red flag when he identified 10 accounts operating 24/7 from the same IP address. Inton reached out via Discord to appeal the ban on his account, so Jiho asked to see video evidence of the family playing Axie.  The video (captured by an Axie-playing neighbor) shows Inton and his two sisters, wife, brother-in-law, two nephews, an aunt and uncle, and a cousin – all sitting on the floor of Inton’s home playing Axie. Each player looks up briefly to smile and wave at the camera before getting back to Axie.  “We definitely want to get people who are outside of Ethereum, outside of the dapp space, outside of NFTs, into Axie,” Jiho said. He has observed other Axie play-to-earn community clusters in Indonesia and Venezuela, but thinks this might be the first evidence of a multi-generational household of dApp users. “As it becomes more easy to onboard, as the benefits get easier to explain, our players feel more confident bringing in their friends and family,” he said.  Jiho attributes much of Axie’s success in the Philippines to Dizon, at Altitude Games. When the two first met at GameFest in Manila 2018, Jiho sent Dizon three Axies and told him to get started. Dizon went on to become a top breeder, owning around 800 Axies and 200 pieces of land (another example of an NFT that can be bought via the Axie Infinity marketplace).  Dizon had been in mobile games since 2003 but only started experimenting with blockchain in 2017, around the time that CryptoKitties was taking off. “I’d never really been interested in the whole fintech scene,” he told me via a Zoom call, noting that a lot of his friends got into crypto when it was recognised as a technology that could drastically improve the cost and efficiency of remittance. “While I could see how important it was, it just never really interested me from a career standpoint,” said Dizon.  See also: Leah Callon-Butler - To See Libra’s Potential, Look at the Philippines, Not the US  But when NFTs finally emerged, that’s when he got excited. “It seemed like a really cool thing to play with, so I got into crypto via the route of blockchain games,” he said. Dizon has also built an Ethereum-powered car racing game inside Decentraland, called Battle Racers, where players can design, build and race cars built from NFT parts.  Dizon said it’s not easy to succeed in the world of blockchain games. He has seen many try and fail in the last couple of years, noting that it’s hard to keep an audience engaged in any game. But in the Philippines, Axie has hit a nerve by becoming a viable means for making a living and spurring viral growth through word of mouth referrals. Especially during COVID-19, Dizon has seen more and more Filipinos popping up in their Discord channel, wanting to know: How do I get started? How do I play?  Even with all the usual growing pains that plague Ethereum, including onboarding difficulties and rising gas fees, this video game has captured the hearts and minds of an entire community in the rural Philippines – demonstrating a strong use case for dapps and teaching players a range of complex concepts from NFTs and DeFi, to smart contracts and tokenomics – all within the space of a few months. With the right design and incentives in place, it seems more blockchain developers should be looking to the world’s underserved populations for a lesson in user adoption.",POSITIVE,ETH,ASIA | AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TRADING,Leah Callon-Butler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/08/26/the-nft-game-that-makes-cents-for-filipinos-during-covid,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/001eaa954ad6abb138cf4aaedc735363481299c4-1412x1059.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Representatives Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey and Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri made the request Monday, according to The Hill.  Calling it ""the largest-ever seizure of online terrorist financing,"" the two lawmakers said it is ""vital"" that members of the Subcommittee on National Security, International Development and Monetary Policy should be briefed on the investigation.  They requested the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Department of the Treasury provide the briefing, with the latter also asked to explain its efforts in tackling potential malicious attacks on U.S. finance.  As for why, Gottheimer and Cleaver explained that this information would help lawmakers develop legislation enabling law enforcement agencies and regulators to ""continue to address the illicit use of cryptocurrency and disrupt terrorist organizations.""  As reported on Aug. 13, the DOJ announced the seizure of 300 terrorist cryptocurrency accounts with funds worth in the “millions of dollars.”  Following an investigation, money-laundering and fundraising efforts involving al-Qaeda, Hamas and ISIS were dismantled, it said.  Gottheimer told The Hill in a statement that it's important ""to stay one step ahead"" of foreign terrorist entities that threaten the U.S.    See also: DOJ Indicts Founder of Anti-Money Laundering Bitcoin Project for Money Laundering",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | REGULATION,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/08/26/us-democrats-ask-trump-administration-for-details-on-terrorist-crypto-seizures,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dacbc6020e9218b9724e59f8dc66d338a58a55c2-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384536,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAYTup,1598446800,Canadian Exchange Shakepay Gets Cold Wallet Insurance to Protect Customer Funds,"Crypto exchange Shakepay, which describes itself as “Canada’s fastest-growing bitcoin platform,” conducted a “proof-of-reserves” audit and acquired an insurance policy to reinforce its security, perhaps learning a lesson from fellow Canadian platforms QuadrigaCX, Einstein and Coinsquare, which all lost customer funds or have otherwise been involved in scandals over the past 20 months.      The Montreal-based crypto exchange hired blockchain forensics firm CipherBlade to conduct a full audit of its reserves and security policies. To safeguard its customers’ funds, the exchange also tapped a third-party custodian and secured a specific insurance policy for its cold wallets through Aon, underwritten by insurers with Lloyd’s of London, the exchange announced Wednesday.      Shakepay CEO Jean Amiouny told CoinDesk the exchange supports bitcoin buying and selling, but tries not to actually hold onto its customers crypto holdings any longer than necessary.      This reduces the risk that customer funds can be stolen should the exchange be compromised.      Read more: Lloyd’s of London Makes Quiet Entrance Into Crypto Insurance Market      “ShakePay is built, not to hold your bitcoin [but] to send it out right away,” he said. “What [our customers] do is they buy bitcoin and then they send it out to wallets they control … as a platform we generally don't hold customer assets very long.”      The five-year-old exchange originally offered a bitcoin debit card, but shut the program down after its issuer experienced some issues. In 2018 the firm pivoted to bitcoin buying and selling, and just passed 100,000 users, he said.    ‘Proof-of-reserves’    According to CipherBlade’s audit report, Shakepay’s reserves fully back its customer assets on paper.      “There was a 100% match between transaction data found in backend systems and amounts credited to user accounts accordingly relative to actual transaction amounts observed on the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains (for cryptocurrency transactions) and bank account records (for fiat transactions) in all transactions observed,” the report said.      CipherBlade worked with Shakepay’s custodian and financial institutions to verify these figures, Amiouny said.      Shakepay’s new insurance covers all funds held in cold storage, meaning it covers “physical theft of the media where the private keys are held,” he said.      The cold storage, in turn, is provided by a crypto custody provider regulated in the U.S. Amiouny declined to confirm the custodian’s name on the record, citing security concerns.      Read more: QuadrigaCX Owes Customers $190 Million, Court Filing Shows      What Shakepay’s new policy does not provide is individual insurance. It’s not like Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance in the U.S., he said.      The exchange also asked CipherBlade to assess the exchange’s personnel and security processes, creating a tiered access system to ensure employees only have access to tools they need to conduct their jobs.      Still, CipherBlade claims “there is no evidence” that indicates Shakepay’s employees might steal or otherwise divert the exchange’s funds, citing criminal background checks it was provided.      The exchange is currently only available in Canada, with no plans to expand beyond the country, Amiouny said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/08/26/canadian-exchange-shakepay-gets-cold-wallet-insurance-to-protect-customer-funds,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/36c05b4a22f72c0fa52fe50890a46c199e5ed54b-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384549,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAYU4t,1598442281,Bitcoin Drop Squeezes Out Weak Derivatives Positions – And That May Be a Good Thing,"Bitcoin’s latest price drop has a silver lining – it has forced out weak hands in the derivatives market and potentially opened the doors for a more sustainable rally to recent highs.    The top cryptocurrency by market value fell by over 3.5% to levels near $11,100 on Tuesday, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.  The price drop triggered sell liquidations, the forced unwinding of long trades, worth nearly $50 million in perpetuals (futures with no expiry) listed on cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, according to data source Skew.  “The positives of last night's move was that it cleared out a lot of the weak leverage longs,” Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a Telegram post, in reference to the perpetuals liquidations.  “Weak longs” is the term used to describe traders lacking confidence or resources to hold assets for the long haul. Usually, it’s the retail crowd that exits the market or is forced out on minor price dumps or pumps.  Markets often shake out weak hands with temporary price pullbacks following strong breakouts like bitcoin’s recent move above $12,000.  Following Tuesday’s price drop, the cost of holding long positions in BitMEX perpetuals, as represented by the “funding rate,” has normalized.  Funding rate is a mechanism used to tether a perpetual contract's price to the spot price.  A high funding rate discourages new investors from entering the market and existing holders from boosting their long positions.  “The unsustainably high funding rate has been pushed back to its typical baseline levels of 11% annualized,” QCP Capital said.  The funding rate had jumped to highs above 60% in annualized terms on Aug. 18, when bitcoin broke above $12,000.  As a result, stronger buying pressure may emerge, leading to a re-test of recent highs above $12,000.  Bitcoin is currently trading near $11,400.

According to a Tuesday report by Darknetstats, Empire Market, the darknet's most popular marketplace by site traffic, was suddenly taken offline on Aug. 22.  Speculation is mounting over the whereabouts of the site's administrators, who some believe have made off with an estimated 2,638 bitcoin ($30.2 million), according to John Marsh, a Darknetstats representative, speaking to CoinDesk via email.  However, Marsh said that figure is not certain as no large movements of funds have been identified.  There is plenty of speculation, but nothing ""concrete"" about what has happened to the site, he said.  An Empire Market head moderator known as ""Se7en"" confirmed the site was down on the darknet forum Dread late Tuesday evening.  Se7en suggested the incident was not an exit scam because that usually entails disabling withdrawals and accepting bitcoin for a period of weeks.  Marsh, however, contested this and said his publication believes it was an ""unplanned exit scam,"" as bitcoin withdrawals were working up to the day the marketplace went offline.  The darknet refers to certain sections on the internet that are only accessible with specific software and use unique communication protocols to provide access.  According to a tweet thread by anonymous darknet journalist ""dark.fail,"" the darknet has been in a ""golden age of trust"" but darknet users should ""expect a rough year of exit scams ahead.""  Dark.fail added that, while it's easy to have a sound idealogy when creating a darknet market, when thousands of bitcoin become involved ""greed can defeat all good intentions.""  One theory raised by Se7en is that Empire Market had been the subject of an ongoing direct denial of service (DDoS) attack and the controllers had just decided to ""call it quits.""  The site has suffered multiple such attacks since going online in 2018 and has been extorted for between $10,000 to $15,000 per week to keep the site live, according to Marsh.

Coinbit also disputed the claim in the Korean media report that an accounting firm had refused to work with it.      Coinbit, South Korea's third-largest cryptocurrency exchange, has reportedly been raided by police over allegations it faked most of its trading volume.    According to a report from Seoul Newspaper on Tuesday, the Seoul-based firm's owner, Choi Mo, and other managers are alleged to have artificially inflated volumes on the exchange by using ""ghost"" accounts to make fake trades, a practice known as wash trading.  In its report, Seoul Newspaper said it had been informed by insiders of corruption at Coinbit months ago and that up to 99% of trading volume was ""manipulated"" on the platform.  Police allege wash trading at Coinbit had produced over 100 billion won ($84 million) in faked income.  The newspaper said it had put off reporting its findings until the raids at the request of the Investigation Department of the Seoul Metropolitan Government.  An accounting firm had reportedly refused to work with the firm after viewing its books.  Seoul Newspaper said it had seen the books and that 99% of recorded trades could not be associated with deposits or withdrawals.

In a court document filed Friday in the Federal Court of Australia New South Wales Registry, New Payments Platform Australia (NPPA) claims Ripple breached Australia's Trade Marks Act (1995) and the Australian Consumer Law with the unauthorized use of its brand and trademark ""PayID.""  NPPA asserts the PayID brand was launched in Australia in February 2018 backed by an AU$3.3 million advertising campaign, and that it has worked since to develop the brand.  However, in June NPPA CEO Adrian Lovney found Ripple had launched a similar PayID-branded service in Australia as part of its Open Payments Coalition (OPC) with 40 partners globally.  Three out of the 40 companies in Ripple's OPC are based in Australia: FlashFX, BTC Markets and Independent Reserve, per the filing.  Lovney claims there is evidence that the three exchanges ""incorrectly believed"" there was an association between services offered by the NPPA and those offered by Ripple under the PayID trademark.  PayID is used by NPPA to identify the its service and the account proxies that form part of its inter-banking services.  It enables customers to create their own unique identifier that can be linked with their financial institution by an email address, mobile number or Australian Business Number.  NPPA said 5 million PayIDs had already been registered and that it already comprises an important part of Australia's NPP – a payments platform developed and operated by NPPA.  Justice Stephen Burley ruled Friday that NPPA may serve Ripple notice outside of Australia.  NPPA is a joint venture public company mutually owned by 13 of Australia's largest financial institutions including the Reserve Bank of Australia, ANZ Bank, Westpac and Commonwealth Bank among others.

42384532,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAYTsJ,1598402290,Crypto Exchange Coincheck to Launch Japan’s First IEO,"Coincheck, one of the largest crypto exchanges in Japan, announced Tuesday it would support a domestic company to launch the country’s first Initial Exchange Offering (IEO) and raise funds via a token sale.    Hash Palette, a platform that distributes content such as Japanese graphic novels (manga), anime and music, aims to raise about 1 billion yen ($9.4 million) through a token sale on Coincheck, CoinDesk Japan reported.  IEOs are one of the emerging ways for companies to find an alternative to traditional fundraising processes. A crypto exchange creates a platform for such companies to issue and sell tokens to investors who have accounts on the exchange.  Coincheck, which is now part of the Monex Group, has had to win over the trust of Japanese financial authorities after the exchange suffered a $500 million hack in 2018, one of the largest hacks in crypto history.  The company plans to issue and list Palette Token (PLT) by March 2021 and claims that it would be the first IEO in Japan.  Hash Palette is a joint venture between manga app company Link-U and HashPort, a blockchain consulting firm.  The capital raised through the token sale will be used for development and operation of the blockchain platform “Palette,” and the company expects most tokens to be sold to fans of Hash Palette content.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TOKEN SALE,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/08/26/crypto-exchange-coincheck-to-launch-japans-first-ieo,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1b635498f6e49c55c2a6cd6ec8c6308015419084-799x533.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384538,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAYU17,1598400636,Crypto and Fintech Investor Ribbit Capital Files to Raise $350M for 'Blank Check' IPO,"Ribbit Capital, a major investor in fintech startups including cryptocurrency and blockchain ventures, is seeking to raise $350 million for a ""blank check"" company that would make acquisitions.    The special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), Ribbit LEAP Ltd., filed a prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Tuesday.  As a SPAC, Ribbit Leap has no operating business – it was created to find and buy one. ""We have not selected any business combination partner and we have not ... initiated any substantive discussions with"" any candidates yet, the prospectus notes.  Unlike traditional publicly traded companies, where major acquisitions are subject to shareholder approval, a SPAC asks for wide latitude to make purchases (hence the term ""blank check"").  ""Our shareholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our proposed initial business combination, which means we may complete our initial business combination even though a majority of our shareholders do not support such a combination,"" warns the risk factors section of the Ribbit Leap prospectus.  JPMorgan Chase is the sole bookrunner for the initial public offering (IPO) of stock.  The underwriter has the option to issue as much as 15% more shares than planned, which would bring total proceeds to $402.5 million.  The prospectus mentions cryptocurrency only twice in passing, in passages that describe Ribbit Capital's range of investments, which also include companies in mainstream financial services and technology sectors.  Ribbit Capital is a founding member of the Libra Association, the consortium set up last year by Facebook to develop a global digital currency (which later curtailed its ambitions to mainly issuing stablecoins tied to fiat).  In the blockchain space, the investment firm led a seed round for Bobby Lee's Ballet crypto wallet startup in 2019. It has also invested in Coinbase, Revolut, Robinhood, Xapo, Chainalysis, Figure Technologies and CRB Group (parent company of crypto-friendly Cross River Bank).  Former U.S. Undersecretary of the Treasury Sigal Mandelkar, who spearheaded crypto-related sanctions efforts against individuals and warned crypto firms to comply with anti-money-laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) laws, joined Ribbit Capital as an advisor this year. She is named as a partner in Tuesday's prospectus.  Other Ribbit Capital portfolio companies include Affirm, Brex, Coalition, CreditKarma, MercadoLibre, Next Insurance, Nubank, Root, Sea Limited, Upgrade and Zillow.    While it's unclear how much Ribbit Leap will focus on crypto or blockchain acquisitions, the filing comes at a time of renewed exuberance in the sector. Aside from the bull run in coin prices, fledgling exchange INX Ltd. has launched an on-chain regulated IPO, and heavyweights Coinbase and Ripple are reportedly eyeing public listings.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Marc Hochstein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/08/26/crypto-and-fintech-investor-ribbit-capital-files-to-raise-350m-for-blank-check-ipo,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/60f2a90b82f7a5c477e93de5918e5b9ba81f0e3c-1200x675.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
