42427566,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWPXh,1495820108,Is the Crypto Asset Class Finally Coming Into its Own?,"It's no secret that bitcoin, ether and other cryptocurrencies have been on a tear.  But, is this sharp uptick in value a sign that these innovative technologies are building greater legitimacy, or is it simply the latest evidence that the early-stage assets have been driven up by the speculation of a small set of true believers?  Previous CoinDesk articles have examined this question, examining market activity, polling analysts and looking at Google Trends data. One article looked at whether cryptocurrencies had entered a bubble earlier this month, when their total market cap neared $50bn.  Interestingly enough, this market cap surpassed $90bn earlier this week, representing a year-to-date (YTD) gain of more than 400% from the value of $17.7bn at the start of the year, according to CoinMarketCap data.  At the time of report on 26th May, this market cap had retreated to $80.1bn, representing a YTD gain of more than 350%.  This year, several cryptocurrencies have experienced notable increases in value.  The price of bitcoin, for example, reached $2,791.70 25th May, which represented a more than 200% increase from the cryptocurrency's price of roughly $923.67 at the start of the year, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  Amid this sharp rally, bitcoin's market cap has surged, surpassing $45bn earlier this week, a roughly 50% increase in the last month, additional BPI figures show.  At the time of report, the currency's price and market cap had both fallen back somewhat, reaching roughly $2,440 and $40bn at 16:30 UTC.  Alternative asset protocols have experienced even stronger gains so far this year, as these currencies draw robust inflows.  The price of ether, which powers the smart-contract platform ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency at the time of report, surged more than 2,500% from roughly $8 at the start of 2017 to an all-time high of $228.37 on 24th May, CoinMarketCap figures reveal.  Even after pulling back to roughly $180 at the time of report, ether's price had risen more than 2,100% YTD, according to CoinMarketCap.  XRP, the token of the Ripple network and the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, experienced even stronger gains, climbing more than 6,000% from roughly $0.07 at the start of the year to approximately $0.43, according to CoinMarketCap.  This asset had pared these gains at the time of report, trading at $0.30, a YTD gain of more than 3,000%.  While cryptocurrencies have generated very strong gains this year, analysts offered mixed views on whether they are in bubble territory.  Bubble concerns  Some market observers stated emphatically that the price of these assets have grown inflated.  Jehan Chu, managing partner at Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency fund Jen Advisors, was of this view, telling CoinDesk:  ""There is definitely a bubble forming in cryptocurrencies … the recent market cap surge is largely due to the up-cycling of crypto wealth being re-invested into the space. While new money is coming in, most of the market cap is speculative gains being redistributed into new projects.""  He told CoinDesk that he believes only a few projects will be the ultimately beneficiary of these gains, naming bitcoin, ether and zcash as assets with staying power.  Charles Hayter, co-founder and CEO of exchange service CryptoCompare, offered similar input, stating that a lot of the current price growth is speculative.  ""There is a lot of misinformation and information asymmetry which can lead to poor decision making and a trading herd mentality,"" he said.  But this behavior is certainly not unique to newer asset classes, he noted.  ""Throughout history we have seen this pattern re-repeat itself – whether it's the South Sea bubble or with various crazes or new discoveries and even the internet bubble. Greed takes hold and rationale flies out of the window,"" Hayter said.  In spite of all this, there is a silver lining, as ""it's through the shakeout that real winners are found,"" he said.  Potential upside  While some analysts warned that cryptos may have entered bubble territory, Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of leveraged digital currency platform BitMEX, emphasized that these assets could experience further inflows now that wealthy individuals have started looking.  ""We are finally at the point where wealthy individuals, those with [more than] $1 million of liquid assets, are considering whether to allocate a very small portion of their net worth into digital assets,"" he said. ""If this happens on even a small scale, the value of the entire industry will be in the hundreds of billions of dollars in short order.""  The broader cryptocurrency space may be well-positioned to draw additional inflows, due to the constant creation of new alternative asset protocols and the ever-changing range of value propositions they provide.  Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Asset Management, commented on this development:  ""The growth of alts has changed [cryptocurrencies] from a one-trick pony to a range of investments in which one can construct a portfolio.""

42427552,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWP5h,1495814715,Spanish Banks Form New Blockchain Consortium,"A group of Spanish banks has formed the country's first blockchain consortium. Wholesale bank Cecabank announced the effort today, partnering with professional services firm Grant Thornton.  Who's involved: In its announcement, Cecabank doesn't say which other institutions are taking part, stating that it ""comprises 33% of the Spanish banking sector"". However, according to Spanish newspaper El Pais, the group's membership includes Abanca, Bankia, CaixaBank, Kutxabank, Ibercaja, Liberbank and Unicaja.  It represents the first major foray into blockchain for these companies, as other Spanish banks, including Banco Santander and BBVA, have been working with the tech for some time.  What they're saying: Thus far, only Cecabank has commented publicly on the consortium effort, describing it as a way for its employees to get a top-down understanding of the tech – as well as possible insight into how the bank might actually go about using it.  ""Employees of all our functional areas are not only going to gain an in-depth understanding of the technology, but also of all the new features that arise, which is indispensable, considering the momentum for constant progress maintained by blockchain,"" Jaime Manzano, its head of reporting, operational management and banking training services, said in a statement.  The goal? New products and services, according to Grant Thornton's Luis Pastor.  ""Our intention is to help Cecabank to implement the technologies necessary for its companies to be the first to make good use of the advantages that blockchain is expected to produce,"" Pastor said.

42427558,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWPHh,1495801815,Skeptical of ICOs? Investor Vinny Lingham Can Change Your Mind With a Marker,"Up against a white board, Vinny Lingham makes a convincing case for initial coin offerings (ICOs).  Darting and drawing various charts and lines, Lingham positions the nascent concept – through which entrepreneurs sell blockchain-linked data that will form an underlying part of an in-development distributed service – as one that will change the world.  Lingham argues that ICOs, while today criticized for their relative newness and lack of legal framework, have given entrepreneurs the ability to solve a key problem. Namely, how to fund an idea before the point at which outside capital could acquire new users that enable the company to develop toward a successful exit.  ""This is the problem we're solving. There's a gap between network value and user value,"" he explained. ""VCs don't want to fund the gap between the incremental cost of the user and the break-even point.""  It's perhaps this enthusiasm that is leading Lingham to offer a token that will enable users to buy into the network effect he wants to create with his blockchain identity startup Civic, founded in 2016 as a way to tackle problems relating to identity theft, but that has since expanded into online verification.  Lingham explained that in order to grow, Civic will need to turn its service – which enables users to prove personal information to websites – into a kind of marketplace where consumers and businesses are able to exchange and monetize this kind of data.  Lingham is now working with partners to launch the crowdsale, scheduled for the first week of June. Currently, he's engaging in pre-sales with minimum limits for big buyers. Though the mechanisms of the token sale are still being finalized, users will buy an ethereum token that will serve as a ""pre-token"" to be exchanged for another token, based on the bitcoin blockchain, later on.  Why go through this process? Lingham is articulate on the value proposition, arguing Civic is using the cryptographic tokens to empower early adopters to evangelize for the network.  ""We're solving a distribution problem,"" he said. ""We're extracting the creation of a powerful network from the company's equity structure.""  The marketplace  There's also the unique nature of blockchain networks.  In interview, Lingham argued that he'd have to raise far more should he want to capitalize his network via traditional VC funding. (The platform raised $2.75m last year at launch, but he estimates the new plan would cost $60m to implement given customer acquisition costs.)  Over time, he projects that the increase in value derived from launching a successful token could become a ""war chest"" that powers user acquisition. Distributed ledger startup Ripple, for example, holds billions in its native cryptocurrency, XRP, and plans to sell these tokens selectively over time to promote its growth.  For Lingham, capital is crucial as he wants to enroll banks and consumers into a new kind of identity marketplace, one where users could demand value for their data from companies, and companies in turn could gain an additional revenue stream by selling the verification of the data that they've acquired in such exchanges.  Potentially, he envisions how such a system could enable banks to make KYC systems a monetizable asset, while keeping the ownership of data in the hands of users.  ""Let's say Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Chase, they all know you. And you go to open up an account at Robin Hood, and Robin Hood says, based on your ID, it looks like there's four providers you trust. It could become a bidding system,"" he said.  International reach  As for why such a system would need a token, Lingham credited traditional problems with value exchange over the internet as yet another supporting factor.  Given that the online marketplace involves an array of countries, many with their own national currencies, he foresees needing tokens to facilitate the types of quick exchanges and verifications users and websites would want.  ""If you give us your profile, we'll give you tokens,"" he said. ""Users can sell their data anywhere. We're taking a market that exists, and we're saying here's a marketplace, we drop the costs for everyone.""  Rather than a ""fly-by-night"" operation, Lingham painted Civic's ICO as one of the first that open up a network created by an entrepreneur with a successful exit – Lingham sold his mobile gift card startup Gyft to First Data in 2014 – to the wider market.  Still, Lingham said he's not without doubts about the process. ""I still challenge people on why they are doing an ICO. For us, we're solving a distribution problem,"" he said.  As users benefit from low-cost participation in the data exchange market should they buy in early, Lingham hopes tokens could help the network scale to bitcoin-type levels.  He concluded:  ""This is basically saying how fast can we build this network on steroids.""

42427550,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWP3h,1495795514,Day of Demos: Blockchain-IoT Consortium Kicks Off With Use Cases Aplenty,"“Who are all these people interested in this?""  The question, asked by Shilpi Kumar, head of product commercialization at Filament, summed up the reaction to a Trusted IoT Alliance event sponsored by Cisco in San Jose last week. As the event showcased, the intersection of the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain is becoming more congested, with commercial products now live, instead of merely proofs-of concept.  According to Kumar, only a year ago Filament, which sells IoT hardware connected to the blockchain, was often receiving confused, if not skeptical, looks when the company mentioned it was developing blockchain for IoT applications. And now, she said, looking out over a room of about 100 attendees, “there’s all these people sitting with us at that intersection.”  Not only are more entrepreneurs interested in the space, but, in the past three months, calls from corporate clients asking how the blockchain plays a role in Filament’s business model have increased as well, she said.  This increased interest could be, in part, the work that Bosch, Cisco and the other members of a previously unnamed group have done to create awareness of the many use cases for blockchain in the IoT industry.  But, according to Anoop Nannra, the senior leader and head of distributed ledger technology and blockchain incubation at Cisco’s Strategic Innovation Group, both IoT and blockchain are nascent industries where much collaboration must be done to ensure the industry succeeds.  “A number of blockchain IoT startups in this space came together and recognized common challenges ... that there’s a missing identity later in IoT and maybe blockchain could potentially solve that,” said Ryan Orr, CEO of Chronicled, a blockchain startup that’s also a part of the alliance.  He continued:  “But if we all took a different approach with smart contracts, we’d end up with [a bunch] of different startups and processes that would create confusion and not any one would take hold of the market.”  The alliance was set up late last year to develop common protocol 'primitives' to merge blockchain and IoT through smart contracts using ethereum, the Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger and JP Morgan Chase’s Quorum. And, although Orr believes there will be hundreds of IoT blockchains, the alliance’s hope is that it can create interoperability between those.  About half of the room consisted of blockchain aficionados, and half were individuals and companies representing the IoT space. According to Joe Pindar, CTO and director of product strategy at Gemalto, this diversity matters as the industry tries to weed through the froth and spin.  Get your engines ready  The alliance seems to have cut through some of the hype within the blockchain IoT space, at least in the automotive and transportation industry. Three presentations at the event focused on this sector, including a demo by Stephan Tual, founder and COO at Slock.it (of The DAO fame).  Slock.it’s Share and Charge project built autonomous electric-car charging stations using Raspberry Pis. The effort also allows owners of charging stations to share their energy reserves with others.  According to Tual, there are only 6,181 charging stations throughout Germany for a population of more than 82 million. But the number of Germans with electric cars and personal charging stations is estimated at over 45,000.  “By sharing charging stations with each other, you can double the number of charging stations in the country,” Tual said.  Slock.it’s app for the electric charging service is currently downloadable, with about a thousand charging stations currently connected. The project, which was built on ethereum but abstracted the cryptocurrency from consumers, was very popular and captured people’s attention, Tual claimed.  There were hurdles, however. Installing Raspberry Pis in charging stations came with its challenges, including needing to measure temperature changes so the machine wouldn’t shut down. Further, the public key infrastructure used to secure cryptocurrency transactions is not only difficult for consumers to understand, but also comes with serious consequences in the case of loss or theft.  And the tools available for blockchain are still young and underdeveloped, Tual said. For example, because the economic 'gas' price estimation is off, transactions on ethereum are not as cheap as the industry first touted. Gas is the term for the internal price for making a transaction or running smart contract on ethereum.  Although Vitalik Buterin, the founder of ethereum, has said he’ll fix the issue with various hard forks, according to Tual, he argued a more sensible approach would be to initiate a state channel transaction, where each subsequent transaction and receipt is replaced by the next. This means “there's only one blockchain transaction instead of 147 ... so it’s way cheaper”.  “Block-ifying things is not straightforward.” Tual said. “But we’ve proved that we can do blockchain development outside a [proof-of-concept] and we’re quite proud of that.”  Other projects  Executives from Oaken Innovations and Bosch also presented automotive applications for blockchain in the IoT space.  Oaken demoed its tollbooth proof-of-concept, which uses IPFA and ethereum to allow Tesla cars to pay automatically at toll booths. The project won first place at a United Arab Emirates-sponsored blockchain hack recently.  “The car goes to the tollbooth and it’s a true machine-to-machine transaction, as they both have ethereum nodes inside,” said John Gerryts, cofounder and CEO of Oaken. “We were able to reduce transaction costs, going from the traditional card models with 2% to 4% transaction fees and reduce that to a 0.1% fee.”  And Bosch demoed its blockchain-based system to prevent odometer fraud.  According to Timo Gessmann, director of Bosch IoT Lab, nearly one in three cars' odometers are manipulated before they are sold. With a lower number of miles on a car, both individuals and car dealers can sell a vehicle for a higher price.  “Odometer numbers can be like a cryptocurrency,” said Gessmann during his presentation at the event.  The company is currently testing the project as a white-label solution, offering certificates that guarantee the odometer reading is correct, because the data has been recorded on a blockchain. The company has also developed CertifiCar, a consumer-facing mobile application that tracks car mileage.  Echoing Tual’s sentiments, Gessman said blockchain-based solutions are not easy builds. Ethereum transaction costs are high and it costs a considerable amount to build trust within consortia sharing data, he said.  The physical-digital link  Nearly all the other demos at the event focused on tracking the provenance of products along the supply chain.  BitSE demoed its work with VeChain to develop unique tags for all sorts of luxury goods.  Currently the company is working with the biggest wine importer in China. The company developed a tag embedded with a chip that sits on the top of the wine bottle. The chip monitors vibrations, temperature and other characteristics throughout the supply chain. And if someone wanted to tamper with the contents inside the bottle, upon opening it, they would destroy the unique tag.  The company also has its blockchain-based tags in luxury brands.  BitSE has more than two million product identities in production running on VeChain. Those products are worth about $450m renminbi, according to DJ Qian, CEO of BitSE.  Qian said that, in June, the company will be announcing a particular luxury brand using BitSE’s tags, which will not only allow consumers and merchants to scan the tags with their phone to verify the authenticity of the piece, but will also allow them to interact with the brand.  Chronicled then presented its tamper-proof crypto-seal for packages, documents and other high-value goods, such as electronics and forensic evidence bags. Sam Radocchia, the chief product officer at Chronicled, said the company has been working with the pharmaceutical industry too.  Filament also demoed a sharing economy handheld drill. The drill contained what Filament calls “the path”, a small Bluetooth-enabled device with a built-in contract that allows people to lease the tool for a specific amount of time. When someone signs a digital lease, the information is sent to the drill and an LED light on the tool lights up green indicating it’s ready for use. When the lease expires, the drill ceases to function.  “It’s kind of gimmicky,” said Filament’s Kumar. “I don’t think we should have a sharing economy for drills [due to their short lifespan] ... but our clients are thinking about other industrial infrastructure.”  For instance, many construction companies are wondering if they can not only monetize the leasing of their large equipment, but also monetize the data that’s collected from those machines in use.  Experimentation and governance  While a legal entity has not yet been created, the alliance has set up a working governance structure.  So far, the alliance’s model will have 21 industry board seats with five executive board seats. Two in-person meetings per year will see the board review new proposals and allocate funding. And as the alliance grows, smaller committee working groups will be created to focus on particular niches.  “It was also important to show that there was some validation of the technical idea, that it makes sense to do a blockchain-agnostic IoT-oriented working group,” said Zaki Manian, founder of SKUChain, a DLT startup focused on supply chain, and one of the founding members of the alliance. “The initial thing we put some effort into was a basic proof-of-concept of this idea of a unified registry.”  The unified registry allows companies to put IoT device identities onto a blockchain and give each device its own private key. The API, which the alliance announced about a month ago, allows all these registries on separate blockchains to be unified.  “We clearly demonstrated with limited resources that we can make this work,” Manian said.  And it worked without recreating the wheel, said Nannra. Instead, the group developed a model for portability of identities and interoperability between blockchains.  Yet, the group’s mission isn’t to create standards – Orr thinks it’s too early for that. Instead, the aim is to build an open-source blockchain base layer via which collaborating companies can then compete with the applications built on top, he said.  According to Orr, the group is focusing on getting 15 pilots running in the next 12 months.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Filament.
