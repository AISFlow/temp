Chenard  has founded numerous startups in the Internet and media sphere including Tremor Video, and was formerly CEO of in-image advertising pioneers Image Space Media.  Igot co-founder Rick Day told CoinDesk that Chenard's involvement will bring added value, not just in money but in experience:  ""Frankly, the field is so new and interesting that it is attracting great minds and giving us the chance to work with people we might not have otherwise come into contact with.""  While Day didn't disclose the exact size of Chenard's stake, he added that initially igot had met with larger investment funds from several continents and was ""completely shocked with their proposals"", including at least one that would have seen igot absorbed into a larger corporate structure straight away.  International approach  Igot's  largest customer bases at the moment are Australia and India, but the company has far more ambitious plans, aiming to establish itself as a popular exchange throughout Asia and beyond, including Europe and the Middle East.  Day has a background in payment processing and formed igot with lawyer Patrick Manasse, after the two met in New York.  The pair chose Australia as the location for their endeavor due to its convenience as a gateway to Asia, and Asia as a target market due to a lack of any integrated payment network covering the whole continent, like the USA's ACH (Automated Clearing House) and Europe's SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area).  Maintaining independence  While igot is naturally delighted with the extra investment, Day said a sense of frugality forced by working in such a new field actually helped build the business.  ""We were originally 100% bootstrapped,"" Day said. ""Partially this was due to the fact that when we started very few people had heard of bitcoin. We spoke to banks and to investors but most people had no idea what we were talking about.""  Day said he was undeterred despite the challenge, however, recalling:  ""We squeezed every dollar, which in retrospect has engendered a certain discipline in our team. Unless we're pretty certain that dollar is going to generate more than a dollar in revenue fairly quickly, we don't spend it.""  Eventually, though, they preferred the flexibility of working with smaller individual investors, which allows them to stay independent and seek a more diverse range of markets worldwide.  ""Too much money can also be the death of a company. There are a thousand great ideas coming out of our people every week, but the processes we’ve developed to evaluate and test these before moving forward is worth its weight in gold, and we probably wouldn’t have developed this discipline if we didn’t have resource constraints.""  The founders have already made back all the money they put in ""plus a seriously healthy profit"", Day said, which had all been reinvested into the company.  ""Now the only real question left is, how fast can we grow? That takes a lot of concerns off the table.""  Australia's appeal  Igot customers are able to fund their accounts with BPAY, Australia's dominant electronic payment network for almost all bills. It also accepts direct debits from bank accounts, and Day said there have not yet been the kinds of issues encountered by other companies with banks unilaterally closing accounts.  He added that Australia had huge potential as a bitcoin hub. While he has seen customers make large purchases such as cars through igot's exchange, some trades were made for major export items like coal.  In an economy like Australia's, which is still centered in large part on primary industries and the mineral resource exports, introducing bitcoin into the mix as a payment option could have massive implications.  Igot is also planning some financial innovation with bitcoin and promises new announcements with investment products are coming soon.

42425779,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgJ1h,1403646638,Darkcoin Battles New Setback to Anonymous Transaction System,"Darkcoin has suffered new setbacks stemming from the launch of its 'masternode' system for ensuring anonymous transactions, with the rollout requiring multiple hard forks and a reworking of the deployment strategy.  The darkcoin development team’s launch of the masternode feature took place as scheduled on 20th June, but issues similar to those that plagued a previous attempt to deploy the system reportedly resurfaced.  The masternodes act as transaction bundlers and mixers, preventing network actors from discerning the origin and destination of transactions within the darkcoin network. This feature, known as DarkSend, incentivizes masternode participation through a dividend-like payment system.  Lead developer Evan Duffield told CoinDesk that the process of hard forking a coin is risky, saying:  ""Certain features of the coin remain in active development and we will obviously encounter both triumphs and setbacks in that regard. It’s easy to have completely smooth sailing when you don't do any hard forks, especially dealing with changes to the block chain itself.""  The event had an impact on the price of darkcoin as well. New figures from Coinmarketcap indicate the price had risen from an average of $10 to more than $12 in the two days leading up to the hard fork. However, the price has since fallen below $10 as the fork issue resurfaced.  At press time, the price of a single darkcoin (DRK) was roughly $9.60.  Masternode malfunctioning  In a launch post-mortem, Duffield stated that a key function of the masternode protocol was malfunctioning, creating a situation wherein blocks were being rejected by some, but not all, of the network.  Duffield wrote that the problems were not as serious during the second launch, but that the team opted to disable the masternodes as a precaution, saying:  “Two blocks are solved at nearly the same moment on the network, and both are propagated and accepted by the network. In the current implementation, both blocks have the same hash, but in these blocks, there's some discrepancy about who to vote for.”  Some of the masternodes, Duffield continued, inaccurately processed select blocks as fraudulent due to an inability to tell certain blocks apart from others. This led to the creation of forks and necessitated a hard fork to disable the masternodes.  Modified release  On the Darkcoin Talk forum, Duffield outlined the development team’s response to the masternode issue. A central part of the plan involves turning off a setting that triggered the block rejection.  As Duffield explained in the post, the action will allow the team to see how the network functions with masternodes without the risk of forks being created for the same reason as before.  He wrote:  ""In past launches, all problems have come from the client checking the block [for] possible forging of masternode votes. With enforcing mode off, the system will still detect these and report them, but it won't reject the block. So once we stop seeing these messages (except for valid forged blocks) the system is ready.”  The darkcoin development team has also added two new members to support the effort.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Duffield stated that anyone interested in helping out with the testing and deployment process for the masternodes should reach out for more details.

Called Hive Web, the offering boasts secure password generation and BIP32 and BIP39 support, which it says will provide end-users with better privacy and simpler backups.  The web wallet also now supports popular alternative digital currency litecoin, the first of what the company says will be more updates for the altcoin community.    Pleased to announce the launching of the Hive Web Wallet today! http://t.co/lUffYeq51k      — Hive (@hivewallet) June 24, 2014    Dogecoin support, a company representative indicated on reddit, is also being planned for future release. The news follows Hive's May update to its Android bitcoin wallet, which arrived with the ability to host third-party bitcoin applications.  User emphasis  In addition to multi-currency support, the HD wallet also includes a ""waggle"" feature that allows users to find local app users with whom they can complete digital currency trades. However, the development team stressed that despite such features, the app aims to be simple and user-friendly, writing:  ""All we ask you to do is to keep your passphrase safe. We take care of the rest, and you can always access your coins anywhere, even from other wallets that implement the same specs.""  Hive launched in September 2013 with the goal of catering to new bitcoin users, and developers have been discussing possible litecoin integration since that time.  Inside Bitcoins appearance  The announcement coincided with Hive's appearance at Inside Bitcoins Hong Kong, an ongoing digital currency conference focusing on the ecosystem's opportunities and challenges in Asia.  Today, Hive founder and Humint CEO Wendell Davis was in attendance to speak about his project for a panel discussion entitled 'Bitcoin vs Altcoins'. On 25th June, he is also expected to attend a startup pitch competition.  For more on the event, visit the website here.

42425776,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgIxh,1403638244,CoinTerra Seeks Out-of-Court Settlement to Class Action Lawsuit,"UPDATE (24th June 21:18 BST): Comments from CoinTerra CEO Ravi Iyengar have been added.      A class action lawsuit filed against bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer CoinTerra may end with an out-of-court settlement, as both sides in the case have indicated interest in resolving the case before it moves to court.  Ars Technica reported that CoinTerra sought permission from a US judge in a Northern California district court last week to give it more time to arrange mediation talks.  The suit was originally launched in April by Lautaro Cline, a customer from Oakland, California who said he received low-quality mining equipment and, as a result, suffered profit loss. Furthermore, the hardware reportedly arrived past the promised delivery date, which Cline has alleged exacerbated these problems.  The plaintiffs are seeking to name CoinTerra financially responsible for mining profit losses suffered by miners that have entered the class. This includes appropriation of CoinTerra profits for the benefit of miners, as well as compensation for prior damage.  In a statement, CoinTerra CEO Ravi Ivengar declined to comment on the case, but reiterated the company's commitment to its customers, saying:  “While we do not comment on specific dealings with customers, we are committed to providing one of the fastest turn-key Bitcoin mining machines in the world. We are one of only a handful of vendors that has delivered a fully-operational product, and at an industry-leading specification. We have shipped 10,000+ machines and the vast majority of our customers are extremely satisfied with the product we delivered.""  Suit alleges misrepresentation  According to the April filing, the plaintiffs accused CoinTerra of breach of contract and violation of both the Unfair Business Practices Act and the Violation of False Advertising Law.  Specifically, the company is accused of lying about the processing capabilities and energy consumption rates of two of its mining products. CoinTerra allegedly misrepresented delivery dates to a number of its customers who are now part of the class. These dates include delivery times for products that were meant to compensate customers for prior delays.  The filing noted the specific hardware problems in Cline’s CoinTerra product. His TerraMiner IV produced 1.6 terrahashes per second (TH/s) in mining power, compared to the 2.0 TH/s promised by the company. Further, the mining product consumed 2,100 watts instead of the 1,200 originally advertised.  Ultimately, the file states that CoinTerra acted in bad faith to its customers, saying:  “CoinTerra’s conduct was injurious to consumers, offended public policy, and was unethical and unscrupulous. CoinTerra’s violation of consumer protection and fair competition laws in California and other states resulted in harm to consumers.”  Cline’s lawyer, Edward Mullins, said a private mediation date has not been set. However, he said that he hoped the process would begin soon, with a settlement struck ideally before the end of the summer.  Mounting problems for mining companies  Allegations of customer mistreatment have dogged CoinTerra for months. Customer complaints and requests for refunds resulted in a large backlog. The company later offered coupons as compensation for consumer frustrations.  CoinTerra is not the first mining hardware maker to face legal challenges this year.  California-based HashFast fended off numerous legal challenges from customers and investors this year. The company fought being forced into involuntary bankruptcy in late May.  Ultimately, HashFast entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy earlier this month.  In February, Butterfly Labs faced the prospect of its own class-action lawsuit. In total, nearly 300 complaints have been submitted to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regarding the Kansas-based company since 2012.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/24/cointerra-seeks-out-of-court-settlement-to-class-action-lawsuit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bc2958f552653c9dc424936bed41aea2a88c560e-1024x678.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425790,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgJHh,1403635559,California's Bill to Make Bitcoin 'Lawful Money' Heads to Governor,"California Assembly Bill 129, a bill that would deem digital currencies 'lawful money' in the US state, will now head to the desk of California Governor Jerry Brown where it will require final approval to become law.  The announcement comes just weeks after AB-129 came before the California Senate Banking and Financial Institutions Committee, passing by a 7-1 vote.  AB-129, authored by Assembly Member Roger Dickinson, would recognize digital currencies – along with a host of other commonly-issued forms of value including points and coupons – as lawful alternatives to the US dollar. The state-backed currency would still have legal superiority, as Californian residents are not required to accept forms of lawful money.  Dickinson recently commented that the law is primarily designed to allow California consumers the ability to continue using a variety of common payment methods, and to remove penalties currently on the books for their usage.  He explained:  ""In an era of evolving payment methods, from Amazon Coins to Starbucks Stars, it is impractical to ignore the growing use of cash alternatives. This bill is intended to fine-tune current law to address Californians’ payment habits in the mobile and digital fields.""  A law's long journey  AB-129 first gained attention in the digital currency community back in February, when it was reported that the bill had passed the California Assembly, thereby reaching the halfway point in becoming an active law.  At the time, representatives from the California Senate Banking and Financial Institutions Committee told CoinDesk AB-129 needed to pass three stages in the Senate before reaching the governor's desk. These included being approved by the Senate Policy Committee, Senate Fiscal Committee, and finally, the Senate Floor. However, any revisions would necessitate another vote in the Assembly.  Records from the California legislature indicate that the Senate passed an amended bill on 19th June by a 7-1 vote. The amended bill then headed back to the Assembly floor for a 23rd June vote, where it passed by a margin of 52-11.  Now that is has achieved approval in the Senate and Assembly, Governor Brown will have the final say on whether the bill will become law.  Bitcoin in California  The news will be welcome to many in the wider digital currency ecosystem, as California continues to be a hotbed of bitcoin activity.  A recent statistical analysis by CoinDesk indicated that 40% of bitcoin professionals hail from California, with many residing in the area's famed startup hub, Silicon Valley.  Notably, AB-129 is not designed to specifically to support the local ecosystem. Rather, Dickinson told CoinDesk in March that it reflects the government's neutral approach to bitcoin regulation.  For more on the bill and its potential effects on the bitcoin ecosystem, revisit our full interview with Dickinson.

42425799,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgJPh,1403631052,KnCMiner Responds to Customer Backlash Over 'Deceptive' Compensation Scheme,"Cryptocurrency mining hardware company KnCMiner has defended itself against claims it had potentially attempted to mislead customers with its new hosted mining offer.  KnCMiner customers have recently taken to reddit to complain about the Stockholm-based company's use of small print accompanying its new offer, which removes customers' rights to benefit from the previous 2-for-1 Neptune offer.  ""It was never our intention to deceive people,"" said Sam Cole, co-founder of KnCMiner.  Conflicting offers  On 28th April, KnCMiner offered every customer who had an outstanding order for the first two batches of Neptune bitcoin miners a free Neptune, from the third batch. This 2-for-1 offer meant each qualifying customer was promised a free piece of hardware worth $5,995.  The company's most recent blog post stated that customers' Neptune units would start shipping soon. However, an email was also sent out last week detailing a 'Plan B' offer enabling customers to take advantage of free hosted mining while they waited for their products to arrive.  This hash-while-you-wait offer was accompanied by slight changes to the company's Neptune Order Terms, namely the addition of the following clause:  ""If the purchaser of the Products (referred to as the Customer) accepts KnCMiner’s offer and connects to KnCMiner’s Mining Services, the Customer automatically accepts that these General Terms shall apply for the provided Mining Services and that the Mining Services provided by KnCMiner shall constitute the Customer’s sole and only compensation due to the delay of the Products and shall supersede and extinguish all prior agreements relating to compensation for the delayed Products.""  This essentially states that those who accept this Plan B surrender their right to receive the free Neptune they were offered earlier in the year.  ""This is a breach of trust by KnCMiner and an attempt on their part to mislead customers. No customer in their right mind would accept giving up a free Neptune for a couple of days' hosting (a maximum of 1.5 months),"" one KnCMiner customer, who wishes to remain anonymous, told CoinDesk.  Cole said his company has now taken steps to make the offer clearer to customers, and it is also allowing those who have not yet received a pay-out from hosted mining to switch back to the free Neptune offer.  ""Really, it’s a lose-lose for us and either a little win or a big win for the customers,"" he claimed.  Shipping news  Cole revealed his company started shipping the Neptune units last week, with 300 units being sent yesterday and 250 today.  ""With parts arriving all this week and being shipped out ASAP, we are still optimistic that people will receive all their miners this month. If we can’t get through the backlog, then each customer can choose hosted hashing until we have shipped their miners,"" he confirmed.  Cole went on to say KnCMiner would allow customers eligible for the free miner to choose between a Neptune and a Titan.  ""We are giving people free money and way above what they paid for. We try our best but it’s going to be impossible to make everyone happy,"" he concluded.

42425791,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgJJh,1403626559,Robocoin CEO to Demonstrate Bitcoin in Action at Italian Parliament,"Robocoin CEO Jordan Kelley will speak about bitcoin in a public hearing at the Italian parliament in Rome later this week, before demonstrating one of his company's bitcoin ATMs via live video stream.  The 26th June meeting called 'Bitcoin in the Real Economy', will form part of the fourth annual 'No Cash Day' – a trademarked event promoted by Italian Parliament member Sergio Boccadutri and organized by CashlessWay, an e-payment lobby group.  The news comes soon after the developers of Italy's first home-grown bitcoin ATM, CoinCapital and Bit-Wallet, met with a dozen lawmakers and representatives of other institutions at the country's parliament on 11th June.  ""[Bitcoin in the Real Economy] is an opportunity to help educate and have meaningful conversations with Italy’s influential government. Italy is full of cultural tastemakers and has a rich history in banking and finance. These all support Robocoin's goal of helping proliferate bitcoin,"" Kelley explained.  Group effort  At the public hearing, Kelley will be joined by industry leaders from Hyperion, UniCredit, the Italian Banking Association, MasterCard, and others.  Present will be lawmakers, bankers, public utility representatives and other entrepreneurs debating bitcoin’s potential in the nation's economy, including recommendations for a legal framework to aid integration.  Participants will also examine a variety of cryptocurrency-focused topics, including business opportunities, tax implications and controls to avoid criminal activities.  Streamed demo  After his presentation at the parliament, Kelley will leave and then rejoin the event via live stream to activate Italy's first Robocoin ATM, demonstrating its anti-money-laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) technology.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Robocoin indicated that much of the credit for organising the event goes to Federico Pecoraro, a 30-year-old businessman and founder of Robocoin Italy.  The machine will be located at Luiss EnLabs, a leading Italian incubator housed inside Rome's Termini station.  Back in April, Robocoin temporarily installed one of its bitcoin ATMs in Rayburn House on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. More than 50 members of the US Congress lined up to test out the machine.  Hurdles to acceptance  Franco Cimatti  , president of Bitcoin Foundation Italy, explained that, while bitcoin may be slowly increasing in popularity in the country, it still has some large problems to overcome.  ""The problem in Italy is that cashless payments and the Internet are still not present throughout the country, which makes it difficult for bitcoin to be accepted,"" he said.  Another issue, he said, is that many business operators are afraid to accept bitcoin because they think that the state will interfere.  ""Because of this, many are requesting a statement from the state that indicates the lines and limits that a business operator can't go beyond,"" Cimatti explained.

42425795,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgJVh,1403619992,McAfee Report: 'Futile' Mining Botnets Are Going Mainstream,"Security firm McAfee has issued its latest quarterly threat report, focusing on a wide range of emerging technology security risks, including mobile malware disseminated by Flappy Bird clones and dangerous rootkits.  The June 2014 edition of the McAfee Labs Threats Report is the first time McAfee has taken an in-depth look at cryptocurrency mining botnets.  McAfee reports seeing numerous botnets with various levels of mining functionality, but goes on to say that, even if the cost of power and hardware is taken out of the equation, mining major cryptocurrencies on infected PCs simply isn’t a worthwhile pursuit and is already effectively obsolete:  “The difficulty level of common mining algorithms and the nonspecialized hardware that the malware infects make this a futile effort.”  Hard to hide  A further concern for these bad actors is that mining is so hardware intensive that it is relatively easy to spot by the owners of the infected PCs and results in high botnet attrition. CoinDesk examined this aspect of the issue after reports of a botnet designed specifically to target powerful gaming PCs emerged last month.  To get around the problem, malware developers have more recently integrated 'throttling' functionality, which keeps the CPU/GPU cool and effectively puts such attacks into stealth mode.  However, throttling comes with the disadvantage that it reduces the overall performance of the botnet, as well as the host PCs.  None of this has stopped malware developers, of course, and now, rather than operate the botnets themselves, they are selling or leasing their botnets and services to poorly informed cyber criminals.  ""In essence, botnet sellers are selling snake oil when they say that buyers can profitably mine virtual currencies,"" says McAfee.  Mining malware markets  The report states that mining malware is abundant and relatively cheap to hire, with prices for some services starting at just $10 a month.    ""Spend some time digging around any underground security forum or marketplace and you will find a myriad of SHA-256 and scrypt miner botnets, builders, and cracked versions of commercial builders and kits, along with the usual assortment of DDoS bots, cryptors, and other nefarious services and tools [...] These are just a tiny fraction of what exists,"" McAfee says.    McAfee crunched some numbers and concluded that botnet operators don’t stand to earn much, especially if they are trying to mine bitcoin. Even botnets engaged in mining scrypt altcoins suffer from similar problems.  Mobile mining botnets  are even worse, as smartphones and tablets feature much slower CPUs and GPUs than desktop systems, being based on x86 processors and mainstream discrete GPUs.  McAfee spells out the likely returns for operators, stating:  ""In a hypothetical example of a 10,000-device botnet, profit without mining is US$11,000.00 while profit with mining is US$11,007.61—just a US$7.61 gain. This assumes an unrealistic attrition rate of 0.25%. A realistic attrition rate of 30% would result in a loss of US$3,265 in potential profit.""  Unprofitable but popular  The company explained that illicit mining via botnets has moved into the mainstream, due to the fact that mining is now bundled in many toolkits and builders across multiple platforms used by malware developers. Whether or not developers choose to enable mining functionality is up to them.  ""However, there is a great deal of doubt around the profitability of this practice given the resource requirements of the mining algorithms. Nonetheless, the nefarious malware sellers seem to have plenty of motivation to squeeze every possible ounce of profit out of their efforts,"" McAfee concluded.  One can safely assume that botnet operators are more technology savvy than the average person, but judging by the tone of McAfee’s report, it seems many of them could still use a lesson or two in cryptocurrency mining and economics.",NEGATIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/24/mcafee-report-futile-mining-botnets-are-going-mainstream,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bb8f603b5cb4c055e69c5461cce874902637a9e6-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The news follows an abrupt halt of the company's digital currency services this March, when its UK-based payment processor PayPoint said it would require more regulatory clarification regarding bitcoin to support the offering.  This resumed service is the result of ZipZap's new partnership with payments acceptance network Payzone. The Ireland-headquartered company has thus far indicated it does not share PayPoint's reservations about the burgeoning payment technology.  Mark Mellor, director of sales and marketing at Payzone, said in the announcement:  ""We are very excited to partner with ZipZap and participate in the digital currency economy.""  Alan Safahi, founder and CEO of ZipZap, further told CoinDesk that the move marks an end to service interruptions for in-store digital currency buyers. He explained that the service has also been retooled to factor in feedback from a rocky first launch with PayPoint in December, stating:  ""When we launched, we had a lot of people going to stores and trying to buy bitcoin and they had trouble communicating to the retailers. [...] In order to do this right, we've had to do some marketing to the agents and employees. So, this time around we hope to do a better job of handling the messaging.""  Expanded services  The news finds ZipZap aiming to expand its bitcoin services in line with its wider goal of providing both cash-in and cash-out services to digital currency consumers around the globe.  Safahi suggests that beyond the troubles in the UK, ZipZap has global expansion in its sights, stating:  ""Overall, we'll have about 35 countries we'll have cash-in through our network to buy bitcoin. In the next few months, we're also going to be launching [new] countries for cashing out.""  This network, the CEO suggests, will be used to help position ZipZap to influence bitcoin remittance. While he was short on the details, he indicated that the company is currently examining major remittance markets and opportunities for tapping into the demand for potential bitcoin services there.  A full list of countries where ZipZap services are available can be found on its official website.  Long-term effort  Speaking more broadly about macro developments in the bitcoin space, Safahi explained that he was not surprised by the decision of PayPoint to suspend its bitcoin support.  He believes such complications with financial partners will be common for bitcoin businesses, at least in the short term, even if the ecosystem is primed for long-term success.

Patrick Byrne  , the company's CEO, made the announcement at the Bitcoin in the Beltway conference, held in Washington DC over the weekend.  Overstock later told CoinDesk that the decision to donate a portion of its bitcoin sales revenue is “a new one” and that it is still “working out the details”.  Notably, however, the Overstock spokesperson indicated that revenue donated by the company will not go solely toward bitcoin advocacy:  “Any revenue from bitcoin sales that Overstock.com donates will go to support the adoption of cryptocurrencies in general, not necessarily bitcoin in particular.”  “Whatever happens, an official announcement won’t be made until September,” the spokesperson concluded.  Sales without frontiers  Byrne also used the conference as an opportunity to announce that his company plans to expand its bitcoin programme to international users. This will enable bitcoin payments from shoppers in virtually any country worldwide, with a September deadline also slated for completion of the new feature.  He further discussed Overstock’s overall experience with bitcoin, saying the customer response to its decision to start accepting bitcoin payments had been good so far.  The company now expects bitcoin sales to account for about $10m of its revenue over the first year – double the original forecast of $5m. As of late March, however, Byrne was optimistic Overstock's year-end bitcoin totals could reach as high as $20m.  The Utah-based company passed the $1m mark in early March and, by late May, bitcoin sales accounted for $1.6m of Overstock’s revenue.  Big spenders  Byrne explained that more than 4,300 customers had decided to use bitcoin since Overstock incorporated it as a payment method. On average, these users spent more than non-bitcoin users per transaction, and an estimated 60% of bitcoin-toting buyers were completely new to Overstock.  Overstock is also one of few bitcoin friendly merchants that maintains bitcoin holdings of its own. The company keeps 10% of its bitcoin income and Byrne says he personally holds several million dollars in bitcoin.  On top of that, the company says it is open to paying its employees in bitcoin.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/24/overstock-pledges-3-of-bitcoin-profits-to-promote-cryptocurrencies,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b5c36121aa03a9daed71ace9938729d13ff9c667-724x495.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425788,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgJ9h,1403604113,What Canada's New Regulations Mean for Bitcoin Businesses,"Late last week, Bill C-31, the omnibus budget implementation bill, received Royal Assent and became law. Included in Bill C-31 were amendments to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act of 2000 that seeks to bolster the country’s domestic AML policies and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) protections.  Most notably for the bitcoin ecosystem, Bill C-31 will likely apply a broad range of reporting requirements and penalties to the crypto-community through its inclusion of 'dealers of virtual currency' in the updated definition of money service business (MSB).  The regulations have potential implications for foreign operators seeking to serve Canada as well, though the biggest impact will be on the domestic ecosystem, which is still striving to come to terms with the new realities potentially applied by the regulatory clarity.  Early signs are that a small number of businesses have already decided to cease operations as a result.  Breathing space  One complication of the bill is that the definition of 'dealers of virtual currency', although previously suggested to include bitcoin businesses, is not yet clear.  Non-profit Canadian trade organisation Bitcoin Alliance Canada board member Reed Holmes is one representative of the ecosystem that chose to emphasize this viewpoint, stating:  ""The passing reference to virtual currencies in the bill is vague. Many questions still remain unanswered, particularly with respect to what is meant by 'dealing in virtual currencies.’""  Crypto-experts such as Amber Scott, VP of AML with the Bitcoin Strategy Group (BSG), however, believe that there will likely be “a period of at least six months before businesses need to be compliant” with the regulation, should the laws apply to the ecosystem as expected.  For now, this means Canadian bitcoin businesses will be spared from complying with the new policies overnight, providing welcome breathing room to those who spent yesterday wondering if they are now suddenly operating outside the law.  Indeed, there are still a few more steps before these regulations are released and the bitcoin community would need to comply with new expectations. A consultation paper will need to be released, along with draft regulations.  Susan Han  , counsel to BSG and securities lawyer with Toronto-based law firm Miller Thomson LLP indicated that bitcoin businesses may be able to impact the final regulation, should they be able to stay active and vocal in the coming months.  Han told CoinDesk:  “It is very important for [Bitcoin businesses and players] to comment on the draft regulation when the consultation paper comes out. If this regulation goes into effect, and [regulators] define virtual currency to include bitcoin, and virtual exchanges are put in the same regime as MSBs like Western Union or MoneyGram, it’s going to be a very expensive and awkward process.”  Bill C-31 will not come into effect until final regulations are released, which are expected to clarify exactly what dealers in digital currency need to do to comply.  Be prepared  While the final effect on the ecosystem won’t be known until this release, top players in Canada’s bitcoin community are already weighing in on the effect the law may have on their operations, should Bill C-31 apply to bitcoin businesses when implemented.  Scott noted that businesses that operate in Canada or have Canadian customers (including those served via the Internet) will likely need to register with government agencies like the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) as MSBs.  This includes “maintaining an AML and CTF compliance program; remaining compliant with the laws (which includes keeping records and identifying customers, and reporting certain types of transactions); answering to the regulators; and disclosing certain information to financial service providers”.  Most large Canadian crypto-businesses, such as bitcoin exchange service providers Vault of Satoshi and CAVIRTEX say they already adhere to AML and CTF compliance programs and maintain working relationships with FINTRAC.  Mike Curry, co-founder of Toronto-based Vault of Satoshi, told CoinDesk his firm has been expecting such requirements for some time and preparing accordingly:  “We anticipated that this would happen, and worked to build positive working relationships with key players, including FINTRAC and Equifax, so we would stay ahead of the curve in this regard.”  Joseph Onorati, current process director and future compliance officer with CAVIRTEX, went so far as to suggest the there may be a silver lining in how the law will provide clarity to bitcoin businesses seeking banking relationships.  Onorati explained:  “As a registered MSB in Canada, we see Bill C-31 as a route to help Canadian bitcoin businesses gain some regulatory recognition that might carry weight with the traditional financial system. As many Canadian bitcoiners have discovered firsthand, it’s sometimes difficult to get a bank account here for a bitcoin-related business, and we hope future regulation can help those businesses to more easily form banking relationships.”  Unfortunately, Scott noted, although clearer regulation may be seen by some as positive for banking relationships, MSBs still encounter many of the same issues in securing and maintaining these relationships, despite having been regulated for several years.  Defining 'virtual currency'  Bill C-31 does not define dealers in ‘virtual currency’. Instead, the bill states that the definition will be included in the final amended version of Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Regulations.  Past statements from regulators, however, suggest that this final definition will target bitcoin.  A budget document released earlier this year stated:  “It is important to continually improve Canada’s regime to address emerging risks, including virtual currencies, such as bitcoin, that threaten Canada’s international leadership in the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing.”  Generally speaking, if you sell any type of good or service for profit in the cryptospace, you may expect to be included as the definition of a dealer in digital currency. Scott anticipates this definition to appear in the initial consultation paper, expected summer 2014, as well as in the draft version of the updated regulations.  Canada-based businesses dealing in digital currency today, but not engaging in any other MSB-related activities, do not fret: you are not currently considered an MSB, and you don’t have any compliance obligations (yet).  In fact, if you consider yourself to be a dealer in digital currency, you are not even able to register as an MSB at this time. However, it is advised that you start considering this process now to avoid being offside with the law in the future.  Implications for bitcoin operators  If you are working with Canadian customers and are defined as a dealer in digital currency, you will likely need to register as an MSB with Canada’s FINTRAC, should such a definition extend to bitcoin and digital currency businesses.  This process involves contacting FINTRAC to provide initial information and to gain access to its MSB registration site. Digital currency businesses will need to answer questions, including details about the owners of their business, their current banking relationships and their projected revenues. Dealers in digital currency located in Quebec will also require licensing from the Authorite des Marches Financiers (AMF).  Scott said that the federal registration process is not costly, but the Quebec licensing fees can be, depending on the size of the business.  “Licensing fees range from approximately C$607 to C$2,428, excluding additional fees of C$202 per automated teller machine (ATM) operated in Quebec,” she said. However, she cautioned that the process can take quite a bit of time, especially if regulators require clarification or additional documentation from the MSB.  All dealers in digital currency will need an updated compliance program in order to be operating legally. Compliance programs generally have five elements, including a Compliance Officer, Policies and Procedures, Risk Assessment, Training, and Effectiveness Reviews.  Even if bitcoin businesses have gone the extra mile and have voluntary programs in place, they can expect to update these programs when the final regulations are published.  Given that the five compliance elements are consistent for all regulated entities, Scott says that these are very unlikely to be different for dealers in digital currencies. Similarly, the registration requirements for MSBs are not likely to include exceptions.  Scott told CoinDesk,  “In the US, there aren’t any exceptions to federal registration as a money transmitter, but some states have proposed more streamlined and less costly state-level processes. Given that the process in Quebec is not as costly or cumbersome as some of the state-level requirements that we’ve seen South of the border, I don’t expect that there will be changes to the Quebec licensing process to accommodate dealers in digital currency.”  So far, registering as an MSB does not appear to be that much additional work for those found to be operating as dealers in digital currency.  However, dealers in digital currencies who become MSBs will also need to keep customer and transaction records for a minimum of five years, storing them in such a way that they can be easily and quickly retrieved if the regulator requires them (generally within 30 days).  Furthermore, MSBs are required to report certain transactions to FINTRAC and other agencies within set timeframes.  Remember, this does not apply to dealers in digital currency now; if you suspect yourself or your company to be one, you should start thinking now about the types of changes you will need to make to your business structures, IT systems and processes once these regulations are released.  Customer identification  Currently, MSBs are required to perform identify verification on certain types of transactions. These include:  Receiving the equivalent of C$10,000 or more in cash  Selling or cashing C$3,000 or more of travellers’ cheques, money orders etc  Sending or receiving international money transfers of C$1,000 or more  Any transaction suspected of being money laundering or financing for terrorists  These MSBs verify identity in either a face-to-face transaction or by using a combination of specific methods set out in the regulations.  Scott says that “identification in this case is tightly defined as either the MSB or its representative looking at an original, valid (not expired) piece of government-issued identification in person, or using specific methods described by the regulators. Skype and webcam [don’t] count.”  What will happen now, when we attempt to apply these standards to dealers in digital currencies, especially in the case of bitcoin ATMs?  Han noted:  “Bitcoin ATM operators are touting that they have the identification software that allows them to use face recognition technology, but so far, the regulators have not said that they will find these alternative methods of identification acceptable. There are some really interesting issues about how we are actually going to do this in an online world without using existing AML legislation.”  Potential penalties  Penalties for non-compliance can be significant, and may include either civil penalties, criminal penalties, or both.  For example, noted Scott, “failure to report suspicious transactions can result in penalties up to C$2m and/or five years imprisonment.” In addition, FINTRAC may publish penalties on its website.  “While monetary penalties can be substantial,” Scott said, “it is the publication of these penalties that can ultimately be more damaging to businesses. Few banks or other financial service providers are willing to work with organizations that have published violations for non-compliance.”  Although many digital currency businesses – even those who don’t actually buy or sell bitcoin – face hurdles securing banking partnerships, it remains to be seen if this regulation will provide relief in this regard. Many non-bitcoin MSBs struggle with banking relationships, despite being regulated in Canada for several years.  What’s next for you?  If you think you’re a dealer in digital currencies, you will have an opportunity later this year to comment on the consultation papers and draft regulations.  Scott indicated that it is unlikely that this sector will remain unregulated in Canada for long, and it’s “time to start thinking about what you’ll need to do in order to be compliant. Although there are certain things that you won’t be able to do quite yet, you can organize your resources to be ready later this year”.  Han encouraged potential MSB’s to “really watch this space, wait to see what the consultation paper looks like, and comment on it”, concluding:  “Make your voices heard in Ottawa if you want to discourage these changes from happening. If you want to encourage companies to innovate in this area, then you can’t over regulate. You must recognize that this is a different kind of beast.”  Canadian parliament image via Songquan Deng / Shutterstock.com",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Victoria van Eyk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/24/what-canadas-new-regulations-mean-for-bitcoin-businesses,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/281b47f37dd6e399530aa2e1200826f5b8592bea-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425798,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgJZh,1403594851,BTC China Announces Upgrades to its 'Picasso ATM' Mobile App,"Popular exchange BTC China has added new features and an upgraded interface to its Picasso ATM mobile bitcoin wallet, including a 'Sell for Cash' function that allows anyone to become a 'mobile ATM' and sell bitcoins anywhere in the world with the press of a few buttons.  CEO Bobby Lee announced the new features this morning while delivering the keynote address at the Inside Bitcoins conference in Hong Kong, where competitors OKCoin and Huobi are also revealing new services.  The app is designed as much for use outside China as inside, with support for eight major currencies and ten languages.  Other features  The 'ATM' function shows current market rates and allows users to set their own profit margin on the trade. BTC China receives a 0.5% transaction fee on a sale, deducted from the bitcoin balance.  Picasso mobile  also has the standard send and receive functions. As an HTML5 mobile web app, it was never subject to Apple's previous barring of bitcoin wallets.  BTC China  describes the surrounding infrastructure as offering users ""the highest level of protection for their bitcoin assets"", with a two-password option and all digital currencies stored offline.  Users more sure of their ability to not lose a device can be less cautious, enabling a 'Trust This Device' feature that does not require the main password every time the app starts.  Overseas drive  BTC China, which was China's first bitcoin exchange and the first to receive venture funding, has been noticeable lately in its efforts to appeal to international customers due to China's own fractious relationship with digital currency trading.  Its website interface currently offers direct trades between Chinese yuan and both bitcoin and litecoin, and also between BTC/LTC. Following the Picasso ATM app's example, there are ""plans for more aggressive international expansion"" in the near future.  The Inside Bitcoins Hong Kong conference is a two-day event, which continues on 25th June.",POSITIVE,BTC | LTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | LTC,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/24/btc-china-announces-upgrades-to-its-picasso-atm-mobile-app,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/54402b25e0189d561377c3af92f21f39e1a60512-942x488.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
