""I intend to demonstrate my belief not just in Overstock, but in the TØ.com platform that we built and, indeed, in the cryptorevolution itself,"" he said in a statement.      E-retail giant Overstock has announced it will utilize colored coins to issue what it calls a ""digital corporate bond"", or a cryptocurrency-based security, based on the bitcoin blockchain.

According to the company, the bond will be issued using its ""TØ.com technology"", which was developed as part of its Medici initiative.  In its release, Overstock said it had outlined the initiative in an investor circular distributed at the beginning of this month. Wiredreported the company is looking to raise as much as $25m.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/06/06/overstock-to-issue-digital-corporate-bond-on-bitcoin-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/60d533c7ec659e198ea8e062aee39625a50f241c-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
