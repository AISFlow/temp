42417305,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTY5BV,1725227100,"Cardano’s Chang Hard Fork Goes Live, Introducing On-Chain Governance","Cardano, the layer-1 blockchain launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, activated its highly anticipated “Chang” upgrade on Sunday, marking the ecosystem's long-planned shift towards decentralized governance.  With the Chang upgrade now live, ADA token holders will be able to shape Cardano's future by electing governance representatives and voting on development proposals.  CIP-1694, an official ""Cardano Improvement Proposal,"" describes the new community governance structure and establishes three user-led governance bodies: the Constitutional Committee, Delegate Representatives (dReps), and Stake Pool Operators (SPOs). Moving forward, Cardano's three founding entities—the Cardano Foundation, Input Output Global (IOHK) and Emurgo—will no longer have the keys to trigger chain upgrades or ""hard forks."" Instead, that responsibility will be delegated to the new governance groups.  Cardano is the latest in a string of crypto projects to transition towards a more decentralized structure. The changes bring Cardano further in line with the blockchain industry's decentralized ethos, but they may also be viewed as a way to ward off securities regulators by bestowing ADA with extra utility.  Despite being ranked as the 28th largest blockchain by DeFiLlama, Cardano has consistently drawn attention from the crypto world, not least because of Hoskinson’s colorful personality and routine outspokenness. He originally created the Ethereum blockchain in 2014 alongside co-founders like Vitalik Buterin, but he quickly moved on from the project to build rival Cardano.  Hard forks—significant updates that render older versions of a blockchain obsolete—are a critical part of any blockchain’s evolution. The Chang hard fork is no exception, with its implementation spread across two phases.  The first phase, already live, introduces an Interim Constitutional Committee to temporarily oversee Cardano's governance. This phase is designed to be cautious, limiting the committee’s power to make changes to the blockchain's code while the rest of the ecosystem's governance model takes shape.  The second phase, expected to happen in 90 days, will fully empower the new governance bodies. “Once everyone is onboard and well-informed, they will be ready to actively participate in governance,” said Giorgio Zinetti, CTO of the Cardano Foundation, in an interview with CoinDesk.  This upgrade is a pivotal milestone in Cardano’s roadmap, marking the beginning of the Voltaire era—a phase focused on achieving full decentralization that has been in the works since Cardano’s inception.  “I would say it is the biggest event in Cardano history, and it really makes us different from many other chains,” Zinetti told CoinDesk. “I think we are the largest layer 1 with on-chain governance. There are some smaller players, like Tezos and Polkadot, who already have on-chain governance. But if there was a leaderboard, real decentralized layer-1s, we would be number one.”  Read more: Cardano Blockchain Heads for 'Chang Hard Fork,' Biggest Upgrade in Two Years",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | ETH | FORKS,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/09/01/cardanos-chang-hard-fork-goes-live-introducing-on-chain-governance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/34e73647d8b6da5ce7c4b03e57e4b7e1afcb05a2-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

33069438,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639099,1725203256,$15.3M Pepecoin Whale Gets Their Hands on Mpeppe for $0.001777,"In the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrency, few events capture the attention of the community like the moves of a whale, an investor with a substantial amount of capital. Recently, a notable Pepecoin (PEPE) whale, known for their strategic acquisitions, made headlines again by making a significant investment in Mpeppe (MPEPE). This move not only highlights the growing potential of MPEPE but also underscores the ongoing interest in meme coins that continue to dominate the market. The Pepecoin (PEPE) Phenomenon Pepecoin (PEPE) has been a staple in the meme coin sector, consistently attracting a dedicated following despite its volatility. Recently, Pepecoin (PEPE) experienced a slight dip, with its price dropping by 8% to $0.00008583. However, this decline did little to deter the whale’s interest, as the increased trading volume rising by 27% to $907 million suggests an imminent price movement. The technical analysis of Pepecoin (PEPE) indicates the formation of a Falling Wedge pattern, which often precedes a bullish reversal. Should this pattern hold, analysts predict a potential price surge of 30-50%, pushing Pepecoin (PEPE) to as high as $0.00001734. Even with its recent downturn, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicators point to a possible weakening of bearish momentum. This could pave the way for a recovery, reaffirming Pepecoin (PEPE) as a significant player in the meme coin market. Why Mpeppe (MPEPE) is Attracting Pepecoin (PEPE) Whales While Pepecoin (PEPE) continues to be a focal point in the market, whales are always on the lookout for the next big opportunity. Mpeppe (MPEPE) has emerged as a compelling candidate, especially given its current presale success. Priced at an enticing $0.001777, MPEPE is nearing the completion of its Stage 3 presale, with over 80% of tokens already sold. This has caught the eye of the Pepecoin (PEPE) whale, leading them to make a substantial purchase. The timing of this investment is crucial. As Pepecoin (PEPE) hovers at a critical point with potential for a bullish breakout, diversifying into Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a balanced strategy. MPEPE is not just riding the coattails of Pepecoin (PEPE); it’s carving out its own niche, driven by a viral marketing campaign and a passionate community that echoes the early days of PEPE. For the whale, this move represents a calculated bet on the future success of MPEPE, similar to the early gains reaped from Pepecoin (PEPE). Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and Mpeppe (MPEPE): The New Kids on the Block Alongside Pepecoin (PEPE), Pepe Unchained (PEPU) has also been making waves. This Layer-2 meme coin, designed to integrate seamlessly with Ethereum, has already raised nearly $11 million in early funding. PEPU’s use of Layer-2 technology offers faster transactions, lower costs, and improved scalability features that have drawn significant investor interest. Analysts at 99Bitcoins have even suggested that PEPU could have 100x potential, making it another token to watch closely. Mpeppe (MPEPE), however, stands out with its unique appeal. It’s not just another meme coin; it’s a project with a strong community foundation, poised to capitalize on the current trends in the market. With its presale nearing completion, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is positioned to make a big splash once it hits the open market. The investment by the Pepecoin (PEPE) whale further validates the potential of MPEPE, indicating that this token could follow in the successful footsteps of its predecessors. The Strategic Importance of Mpeppe (MPEPE) For investors, especially those who have benefited from Pepecoin (PEPE), Mpeppe (MPEPE) represents an opportunity to diversify while staying within the lucrative meme coin sector. The presale price of $0.001777 offers an accessible entry point, and the strong presale performance suggests a significant upside once the token is publicly traded. As September approaches, Mpeppe (MPEPE), alongside Pepecoin (PEPE) and Pepe Unchained (PEPU), is set to be a major player in the market. Each token brings its unique strengths PEPE with its established market presence, PEPU with its technological advancements, and MPEPE with its viral potential and community-driven success. For those looking to make strategic moves in the crypto space, these tokens offer a balanced portfolio with both stability and high-growth potential. Conclusion The decision by a Pepecoin (PEPE) whale to invest heavily in Mpeppe (MPEPE) underscores the growing confidence in this new meme coin. As the presale nears completion and with strong community support, MPEPE is poised to become a major player in the market. For investors, the time to act is now before MPEPE follows the trajectory of Pepecoin (PEPE) and Pepe Unchained (PEPU), delivering potentially explosive returns in the process. In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, being ahead of the curve is key.

33069397,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639094,1725202886,Top Analysts Believe Mpeppe (MPEPE) Will Out-Perform Playdoge For Best Returns,"Investors are always on the lookout for the next big project that promises substantial returns. Among the emerging tokens, Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Playdoge (PLAY) have been making waves, attracting significant attention from the crypto community. However, recent analysis suggests that Mpeppe (MPEPE) may have the upper hand when it comes to delivering the best returns. Here’s why top analysts believe Mpeppe (MPEPE) will outperform Playdoge (PLAY) and why it could be the standout investment in the coming months. Mpeppe (MPEPE): A Game-Changer in Decentralized Gambling Mpeppe (MPEPE) has quickly established itself as a potential game-changer in the decentralized gambling industry. By leveraging blockchain technology, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a secure, transparent, and decentralized platform for online gaming, setting itself apart from traditional online casinos. This innovative approach has positioned Mpeppe (MPEPE) as a leader in an industry that is ripe for disruption. Innovative Use of Blockchain in Gambling Analysts are optimistic about Mpeppe (MPEPE) due to its innovative use of blockchain technology in the gambling sector. This secure, transparent, and traceable platform eliminates intermediaries, reducing costs and increasing efficiency. This unique value proposition appeals to a broad audience, from seasoned investors to casual gamers. As the platform gains traction, demand for MPEPE tokens is expected to rise, delivering significant returns for early investors. Low Entry Price with High Growth Potential Another factor contributing to Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s appeal is its current low entry price of $0.001777. This presents a unique opportunity for investors to get in on the ground floor of a project with high growth potential. As more users flock to the platform and adoption increases, analysts believe the value of Mpeppe (MPEPE) could skyrocket, offering substantial returns that could surpass those of Playdoge (PLAY). Playdoge (PLAY): Strong Community but Facing Stiff Competition While Playdoge (PLAY) has been a popular choice among investors, thanks to its strong community and innovative approach to combining gaming with decentralized finance (DeFi), analysts suggest that it may face stiff competition from Mpeppe (MPEPE) in the coming months. Community-Driven Growth Playdoge (PLAY) has successfully built a loyal community that actively participates in its ecosystem. This community-driven approach has been a key driver of Playdoge’s growth, helping it to establish a strong presence in the gaming and DeFi sectors. However, analysts note that while Playdoge (PLAY)’s community support is a significant asset, it may not be enough to outpace the rapid adoption and unique value proposition offered by Mpeppe (MPEPE). The Challenge of Sustaining Momentum Analysts also highlight the challenges Playdoge (PLAY) may face in sustaining its momentum. As more innovative projects like Mpeppe (MPEPE) enter the market, Playdoge (PLAY) will need to continue evolving and expanding its offerings to maintain its competitive edge. While Playdoge (PLAY) has shown promise, the question remains whether it can keep up with the pace of innovation in the highly competitive crypto space. Why Analysts Favor Mpeppe (MPEPE) for Best Returns The primary reason analysts favor Mpeppe (MPEPE) over Playdoge (PLAY) for best returns lies in the combination of its innovative approach, low entry price, and high growth potential. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s focus on revolutionizing the online gambling industry through blockchain technology gives it a distinct advantage, especially as more users seek out secure and transparent platforms for gaming. Conclusion: Mpeppe (MPEPE) – The Superior Investment for High Returns Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Playdoge (PLAY) both offer unique opportunities in the cryptocurrency market, but Mpeppe (MPEPE) is considered the best investment due to its innovative decentralized gambling approach, low entry price, and significant growth potential. As Mpeppe (MPEPE) continues to disrupt the online gambling industry, early investors are likely to reap the rewards of this promising project, making it a promising contender in the battle between the two.

33069095,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639086,1725202457,PEPE Whales Set Out To Be Bullish With FOLKI and Mpeppe (MPEPE) With 500x Gains Between Them,"In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrency, whales are often the market movers that can signal the next big wave. Recently, all eyes have been on PEPE, FLOKI, and Mpeppe (MPEPE) as these memecoins capture the attention of whales and investors alike. As we dive deeper into what’s happening, we’ll uncover why PEPE whales are doubling down, why FLOKI remains a strong contender, and why Mpeppe (MPEPE) might be the hidden gem in this trio, potentially delivering staggering returns. PEPE Whales: Accumulating Despite Losses PEPE, one of the most talked-about memecoins, has recently seen renewed interest from whale investors despite its price struggles. On August 17th, two whale wallets accumulated 828.8 billion PEPE tokens from Kraken, amounting to a whopping $6.2 million. Interestingly, these whales had sold 500 billion PEPE just three days prior, only to buy back a larger amount at a lower price. This strategic move indicates that these whales believe in a price rebound for PEPE, especially after acquiring the tokens at a relatively “cheap” $0.0000074 per coin. Such whale actions often hint at potential bullish reversals, as these large players usually have insights that the average retail investor might not. PEPE’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio also supports this narrative, indicating that the coin is undervalued and might be poised for an upward correction. If the whales’ bet pays off, we could see PEPE aiming for a short-term target of $0.000009, which would be a significant gain from its current levels. FLOKI: Riding the Wave of Bullish Momentum While PEPE whales are making their moves, FLOKI is not far behind. FLOKI, inspired by Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu dog, has consistently been in the headlines, and recent technical analyses suggest that it might be on the brink of a major breakout. A Bullish Falling Wedge pattern has formed in FLOKI’s price chart, often a precursor to substantial gains. CryptoAnalystHub and Javon Marks, two well-known analysts, have projected potential gains of up to 96% for FLOKI. Marks specifically points out that a break above $0.0002761498 could unlock even greater upside, potentially pushing the token toward the $0.0005467298 mark. The increase in new addresses and daily active addresses within the FLOKI ecosystem further reinforces the bullish sentiment, indicating that more investors are flocking to the token. With both technical and on-chain indicators pointing towards a bullish future for FLOKI, it’s no surprise that whales and retail investors alike are bullish on this memecoin. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Dark Horse with 500x Potential While PEPE and FLOKI are grabbing headlines, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quietly making waves in the background. Priced attractively at $0.001777, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is positioning itself as a serious contender in the crypto gambling market. As the presale continues to gain traction, more investors are starting to see the potential in this new token. Unlike many other memecoins that rely solely on hype, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a clear utility in the rapidly growing decentralized gambling sector. The project’s focus on creating a decentralized platform for crypto gambling is what sets it apart. This unique value proposition has attracted a significant amount of attention, with predictions that Mpeppe (MPEPE) could deliver returns of up to 500x for early investors. FLOKI whales, in particular, have started to diversify into Mpeppe (MPEPE), recognizing the token’s potential for exponential growth. This strategic move could indicate that Mpeppe (MPEPE) is on the brink of a major breakout, following in the footsteps of its more established peers. The Synergy Between PEPE, FLOKI, and Mpeppe (MPEPE) The combined interest in Pepecoin (PEPE), Floki (FLOKI), and Mpeppe (MPEPE) from whale investors is more than just a coincidence. Each of these tokens brings something unique to the table, creating a diversified portfolio that could yield massive returns. PEPE offers the allure of a potential price rebound driven by whale accumulation, FLOKI is riding a wave of bullish momentum supported by strong on-chain data, and Mpeppe (MPEPE) presents a fresh opportunity in the booming crypto gambling market. As we move further into 2024, these three tokens could very well lead the next big wave in the memecoin sector. Whether you’re a whale or a retail investor, keeping an eye on PEPE, FLOKI, and Mpeppe (MPEPE) might just be the key to unlocking substantial gains in the near future. In conclusion, the recent moves by PEPE whales, the bullish outlook for FLOKI, and the emerging potential of Mpeppe (MPEPE) make this trio a must-watch in the crypto space. As always, investors should conduct their own research and consider the risks involved, but the potential rewards could be monumental for those who get in early.

33069012,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639082,1725202309,FLOKI Whale Enters The Crypto Gambling Casino Market With Mpeppe (MPEPE),"The cryptocurrency market has always been full of surprises, and the recent moves by some of the biggest players in the industry are no exception. One of the most intriguing developments involves a FLOKI whale making a significant entry into the emerging crypto gambling sector through a substantial investment in Mpeppe (MPEPE). This move not only highlights the growing interest in Mpeppe (MPEPE) but also signals the potential of this new token in the rapidly evolving crypto gambling space. FLOKI’s Meteoric Rise FLOKI (FLOKI), a meme coin that has captured the imagination of the crypto community, recently experienced a remarkable 26% surge. This surge was notable in a market where most other cryptocurrencies were seeing red. While Bitcoin dipped below the critical $60,000 mark, and Solana saw an 8% decline, FLOKI defied the odds, trading at $0.0001559 and demonstrating the power of community-driven tokens. FLOKI’s rise is not just a flash in the pan; it’s backed by strategic partnerships and significant market movements. Recently, FLOKI outperformed other popular meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogwifhat (WIF), both in terms of price movement and trading volume. With a 24-hour trading volume hitting $492 million, FLOKI is cementing its position as a serious contender in the meme coin arena. The FLOKI and Premier League Connection FLOKI’s momentum was further boosted by a groundbreaking partnership with Nottingham Forest, a Premier League football club. This partnership, for the 2024/2025 season, is part of FLOKI’s broader strategy to enhance its global presence and shift the perception of meme coins from mere novelty to serious financial assets. The Premier League is one of the most prestigious football leagues globally, with a reach of over 712 million households in 190 countries. By aligning itself with such a high-profile sports entity, FLOKI is making a statement: it’s here to stay and aims to be more than just a meme coin. Enter Mpeppe (MPEPE): The New Player in Crypto Gambling As the FLOKI whale makes moves, attention is shifting to Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new entrant in the crypto gambling market. Mpeppe (MPEPE) has been gaining traction in recent weeks, and the entry of a FLOKI whale into its ecosystem is a strong endorsement of its potential. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is positioning itself as the go-to token for decentralized gambling platforms, offering users a chance to engage in a wide range of casino games using cryptocurrency. The token’s presale has already attracted significant interest, with many early investors anticipating massive returns as the token goes live on major exchanges. What makes Mpeppe (MPEPE) particularly attractive is its timing and market strategy. As the demand for decentralized gambling platforms grows, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is poised to capitalize on this trend by offering a seamless and secure platform for users to gamble with crypto. The token’s low entry price and high potential for growth make it a compelling choice for investors looking to diversify their portfolios. Why FLOKI Whales Are Betting on Mpeppe (MPEPE) The decision by a FLOKI whale to invest heavily in Mpeppe (MPEPE) underscores the potential synergies between these two tokens. FLOKI has already proven its ability to rally and capture market attention, and its whale investors are now looking to Mpeppe (MPEPE) as the next big opportunity. Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a unique value proposition in the crypto space, with its focus on the gambling market providing a new avenue for growth. The entry of a FLOKI whale into Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a strategic move that could bring more attention to this emerging token, potentially leading to further price surges as more investors follow suit. The Future of FLOKI and Mpeppe (MPEPE) With FLOKI continuing to make headlines and Mpeppe (MPEPE) gaining momentum, the future looks bright for both tokens. FLOKI’s partnership with the Premier League is likely to boost its visibility and adoption, while Mpeppe (MPEPE) is set to become a major player in the crypto gambling sector. For investors, the combination of FLOKI’s established market presence and Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s innovative approach to crypto gambling presents a unique opportunity. As the market continues to evolve, these two tokens could lead the charge in their respective niches, delivering significant returns for those who get in early. In conclusion, the recent moves by FLOKI whales into Mpeppe (MPEPE) highlight the growing interest in decentralized gambling platforms and the potential for massive gains in this sector. As both FLOKI and Mpeppe (MPEPE) continue to build momentum, they are set to be key players in the next wave of crypto innovation. Investors should keep a close eye on these developments, as the opportunities for growth in this space are just beginning to unfold.

The company now holds 226,500 BTC, positioning itself as a significant player in the cryptocurrency market, owning 1% of BTC's supply. The Q2 earnings report highlights their substantial Bitcoin holdings, reinforcing their investment thesis. Introduction MicroStrategy Incorporated ( MSTR ) is a business intelligence (analytics) company that has gained much of its recent fame from its former CEO and founder, Michael Saylor, using the company's treasury to buy Bitcoin en-masse. Since this move, they have begun calling MSTR the first "" Bitcoin development company ."" Saylor has been hoarding BTC in MSTR since 2020, with a massive rise in its holdings, with its first purchase of BTC in August 2020 for $250M , where they purchased a little over 21,000 BTC. Since then, the stockpile has grown to ten times that. As of earlier this month, when they released their Q2 earnings, they have a total of 226,500 BTC, worth a total of $13.4B . Bitcoin Development Company Data by YCharts Take a look at the chart above to see how close MSTR and BTC have been since 2020. Even with MSTR's recent outperformance, we can see from the amethyst line that the correlation hasn't significantly changed YTD. This non-divergence is indicative that the outperformance has to do with MSTR's leverage and less with BTC's price changing, since it is still following BTC's price fairly closely. It is to note that MSTR owns 1% of BTC's total supply . Bitcoin has a fixed supply, meaning that unless MSTR sells their holdings, this figure will only grow. Financing Bitcoin In hindsight, starting the accumulation of BTC right before it's massive jump and during a period of ZIRP (zero-interest rate policy), was a perfectly timed move by MSTR and has led them to have a fairly low cost-basis. MSTR Cost Basis (8/30/24) Market Price (8/30/24) $36,821 $58,8774 With a gain of over 70% on BTC's market value, MSTR is currently sitting on a $5B unrealized gain on their BTC holdings. The reason why folks might be interested in buying MSTR over directly buying BTC or a BTC ETF is because of its ability to finance its purchases. When interest rates were very low in 2020 and 2021, MSTR began to issue tremendous amounts of debt, with the peak of their net debt issuance hitting $1.2B in 2022. Since the Fed hiked interest rates up at the end of 2021, MSTR has toned down their debt issuance. This year, they have even begun reducing their debt holdings, as you can see in the sapphire line below. Data by YCharts Q2 Saw Two Great Financing Moves One of the things that impressed me with MSTR was its timing. Below is the same chart, but with the SOFR overtop of it. It really shows how well MSTR did to follow the Fed and take advantage of financing. Data by YCharts In Q2 this year, there were some major moves for MSTR's financing. This is the activity that has moved the net debt issuance negative, which, I believe, is a very smart move now that borrowing rates have likely peaked . One of MSTR's financing strategies is to rely on convertible notes as it is easier for them to issue stock instead of cash to creditors, since almost all of their cash is being used to buy Bitcoin. We can see this in the chart below. As much cash as is being raised by financing is going straight into investing. These notes are being used almost exclusively to buy Bitcoin. The actual operational component of MSTR has carried a negative cashflow in its tailing twelve-month figure. Data by YCharts 2032 Convertible Note Issuance Just because the net issuance is negative doesn't mean that there wasn't any issuance at all. MSTR issued about $800M in 2.25% convertible notes due 2032. They carry a conversion price of $204.33 (split adjusted), almost 43% higher than current prices. This falls in line with their 4-8% return trajectory for Bitcoin holdings. I recommend reading this article on MSTR from my colleague Stony Chamber Asset Research about how MSTR calculates and is using ""Bitcoin yield"" as a new metric. 2025 Convertible Note Redemption In Q2, MSTR sent a notice of redemption to the holders of the 0.75% convertible notes due 2025. In their Q2 earnings report, MSTR IR wrote that: The holders of substantially all of the 2025 Convertible Notes converted such notes into shares of our class A common stock prior to the Redemption Date. This means that closing out the remaining notes was fairly straightforward, and MSTR paid out $650M in shares to creditors. This has allowed MSTR to keep its cash intact, and use it to accrete more BTC. Operations Are Slowing Down Here is a major risk for MSTR shareholders: their actual business is slowing down YoY. The reason for this is unknown to me, but my guess is that MSTR is losing market share among AI cloud providers Data by YCharts I'm guessing this because their results for the past year are in contrast with competing firms like Snowflake ( SNOW ) or Zscaler ( ZS ), which have seen YoY increases in these same categories. These companies also offer analytics and cloud computing interfaces, along with other services more unique to their brands. Data by YCharts That contrast tells us that the change isn't a sector-wide experience, which means that it comes from within MSTR. That is a bad sign for investors and is a major red flag to consider. MSTR may not be a good Bitcoin bet if its actual operations don't add to the company's coffers. Insider Selling There is absolutely no insider buying at MSTR in the last twelve months, so I can only title this section selling. There has been a lot of selling in the last year. Insider Transactions at MSTR (NASDAQ) The bulk of these sales were from Saylor himself, who exercised and sold billions of dollars' worth of stock options. In total, he sold nearly $400M worth of MSTR stock this year . However, his selling spree stopped in April. Since then, Saylor has not exercised any more stock options and is holding on to the remainder of his shares. This selling makes sense on some level, as MSTR's price has dramatically changed in the last few years. It makes sense for folks to trim their holdings, but does not inspire confidence in investors to see nobody on the inside buying. This lack of buying may not be due to a lack of officer confidence. Because these officers are all compensated partially with stock options, their stock portfolios have become primarily MSTR stock. Any financial adviser worth their salt would recommend, at this point, to trim these holdings and diversify away from MSTR. This is doubly true if these folks continue to work for MSTR and receive even more stock options in the future. Data by YCharts Valuation So, MSTR is a tech company that is unprofitable from its operations, but immensely profitable from its investments in Bitcoin. How should we value it? Its current market cap sits at $25B. Remember that they hold almost $13B in Bitcoin, so their operations account for almost a third of their total valuation. Data by YCharts Like most tech companies, MSTR's valuation is incredibly rich. Its ratios across the board are above the sector average. Whether this is justified or not might depend on your view of Bitcoin, since a rise in BTC's price could justify a higher valuation of MSTR even if its operations stagnate. Data by YCharts For this reason, I consider valuation to be a large risk to shareholders, as it seems to be primarily justified by Bitcoin's price, which is something that MSTR has no control over. Conclusion I am not a Bitcoin bull, nor a bear, which makes considering MSTR for my equity portfolio difficult. While I have some stake in Ethereum, which I covered recently , I do not have a stake in Bitcoin. For now, I am going to issue a hold rating for MSTR. Aggressive investors who are bullish on Bitcoin should consider limiting their allocation to less than 5% of an equity portfolio. Conservative investors who are bullish on Bitcoin should limit their allocation to less than 2% of an equity portfolio. Those who are not bullish on Bitcoin should avoid MSTR entirely.

33064405,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639047,1725192037,"Bitcoin Price Under Pressure? Analyst Explains Why Retreat Below $66,000 Is Bad News","A crypto analyst has pinpointed the $66,000 mark as a crucial level for the Bitcoin price and its trajectory over the coming weeks. Bitcoin Price Needs To Climb Above $66,000 — Here’s Why Popular crypto pundit Ali Martinez took to the X platform to share an interesting on-chain observation for the price of Bitcoin. This on-chain revelation revolves around the warm supply realized price metric, which is derived from the average purchase price of Bitcoin that has been inactive for one to three months. Related Reading: ADA At A Crossroads: Approaching $0.3389 Support With Potential For A Deeper Decline As the name suggests, this realized price accounts for warm (relatively recent) supply metrics, as opposed to “hot” (very recent) or “cold” (old) market activity. This metric is especially relevant because it offers a psychological and technical reference point for investors. Typically, when the Bitcoin price is above the warm supply realized price, it means that the recent investors are in the green. On the other hand, the BTC price being below the warm supply realized price indicates that a significant percentage of recent investors are currently at a loss, which may potentiate selling pressure and result in a bearish trend. #Bitcoin above the warm supply realized price is a positive sign, while dropping below it may indicate the start of a longer bear market. Right now, this level is $66,000. If $BTC stays under it, bulls should proceed with caution! pic.twitter.com/QWzTquQ5Mh — Ali (@ali_charts) August 31, 2024 Data from Glassnode shows that the warm supply realized price is currently around $66,000. According to Martinez, bulls should approach the market with caution especially if the Bitcoin price continues to struggle beneath this level. This is because a sustained sub-$66,000 stay might be indicative of the start of a long-term bear phase, where prices could slip even lower as selling pressure increases. BTC Price Could Continue To Range Between $58,000 And $65,000 Interestingly, it appears that the premier cryptocurrency would still lag under the crucial $66,000 level for a while. According to analysts at QCP Capital, the Bitcoin price is likely to remain within the $58,000 and $65,000 consolidation range over the next few weeks. This projection comes as the Bitcoin market has become somewhat desensitized to the usual bullish triggers. The QCP analysts believe that the price of the flagship cryptocurrency will continue to consolidate until certain positive catalysts ignite the market.

33059576,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639050,1725181210,"Bitcoin In ‘Neutral’ Zone: What This Means, According To Analyst","Bitcoin, the crypto market leader and largest digital asset, currently trades at $58,877 following a rather negligent price movement in the last day. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the premier cryptocurrency saw more lows than highs in August, resulting in an 8.46% decline over the month. As September begins, a CryptoQuant analyst with the username Grizzly has provided valuable insight into Bitcoin’s current price status and potential price action in the coming weeks. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hash Price Hits New Low — Is It Time To Buy? Puell Multiple Index Puts Bitcoin In Decision Zone In an X post on Saturday, Grizzly stated that there is much uncertainty around Bitcoin’s movement based on data from the token’s Puell Multiple index. For context, the Puell Multiple Index is a Bitcoin trading indicator used to measure the profitability of miners and the broader market’s price trend. It is assessed by dividing the issuance value of Bitcoin by its 365-day moving average. According to Grizzly, when this indicator ranks between 0.6 and 0.8, as it currently is, it indicates the BTC market is a “decision zone”, with an equal potential to initiate an uptrend or a downtrend. Generally, a dip below 0.6 indicates that Bitcoin miners are earning less than the historical average, mostly due to a decline in BTC price. Grizzly shares that such a scenario presents a good opportunity for Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA), where investors buy Bitcoin incrementally to lower their average purchase cost over time. Alternatively, a breakout above the 0.8 level indicates an increasing miner profitability, in tandem with rising Bitcoin prices. Based on historical price data, Grizzly states that such development usually represents the start of a bullish market. Related Reading: Crypto Market In Trouble As Analyst Predicts $1 Trillion Crash Bitcoin Whales Count Reach 17-Month High In other news, amidst Bitcoin’s turbulent performance in the last month that have left many retail traders with losses, the number of market whales have maintained a steady growth. According to data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment, there has been a net increase of 283 wallets holding 100+ BTC in August, bringing this metric to a 17-month high of 16,120. An increase in market whales and asset accumulation indicates significant confidence in the token’s profitability in the long term. Thus, this rising level of BTC could be widely interpreted as a bullish signal for the coming months. However, price gains could be expected in Q4 as historical data indicates September may likely present another bearish phase. As earlier stated Bitcoin continues to trade at around $58,877 with a 7.56% decline in the last week. Meanwhile, the asset’s trading volume is significantly down 61.93% and valued at $12.70 billion.

However, fear and uncertainty drive the market, with Bitcoin and most altcoins trading at lower levels. This downturn has impacted investor sentiment across the board. Related Reading: XRP Remains Strong Despite Market Pullback: Analyst Forecasts $500 By 2025 Crucial data from Santiment shows a noticeable change in the outlook of XRP holders. The optimism that once drove confidence is now fading, as most investors are sitting on unrealized losses. This shift in sentiment underscores the growing concerns surrounding XRP’s future, particularly in the context of broader market challenges. With the market under pressure, XRP’s prospects appear increasingly uncertain. XRP Holders Facing Unrealized Losses XRP has demonstrated relative strength compared to other altcoins, dropping 13% from its August 24 high of $0.631. However, this decline has created considerable distress among investors, mirroring the broader market’s uncertainty. Crucial data from Santiment sheds light on the situation, revealing that both the 30-day and 7-day Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratios for XRP have turned negative. A negative MVRV ratio indicates that XRP is currently undervalued, meaning that, on average, if all coins were sold at the current price, most traders would incur a loss. This shift in MVRV ratios is significant, as it suggests that the majority of XRP holders are now at risk of realizing negative returns on their investments. The data reflects a broader trend of investor caution, particularly in light of the ongoing market volatility. While XRP’s performance has been relatively better than many other altcoins, the negative MVRV ratios highlight the growing concerns within the investor community. Related Reading: Ethereum (ETH) Struggles To Break Past $2,600: What’s Driving ETH Down? The declining MVRV ratios serve as a crucial indicator of market sentiment, suggesting that the optimism surrounding XRP may be waning. Investors are increasingly wary of the potential for further declines, which could exacerbate losses. While XRP has shown resilience, the current market conditions and negative MVRV ratios suggest that caution is warranted. The coming days will be critical for XRP holders as they navigate this challenging market environment, weighing the potential risks and rewards of holding or selling their assets. $0.55 Key Support Must Hold For Consolidation XRP is currently trading at $0.559, holding just above a critical support level, the daily 200 moving average (MA), which sits at $0.5509. This level is crucial for maintaining bullish momentum, as it has acted as a strong support, giving hope to investors expecting a price recovery. If the price can sustain above this MA, it may signal a potential continuation of the uptrend, reassuring bulls. However, if the price drops below this key indicator, it could trigger a further decline, pushing the price toward lower demand levels. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Funding Rate Signals A Decline: Investors Expect $130 The next significant support to watch would be around $0.48, a critical level for bulls to defend. Holding above the 200 MA is essential for maintaining a positive outlook, while a break below could indicate increased selling pressure. As XRP navigates through this pivotal phase, traders and investors are closely monitoring these levels to assess the market’s next direction.
