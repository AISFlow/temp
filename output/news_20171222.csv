According to the state-owned media agency BelTA, on Dec. 22 Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko signed a digital economy development decree that legally enshrines the use of emerging technologies like blockchain, while also offering significant tax incentives in a bid to attract business activity.  The decree, as summarized by a local IT firm that advocated for the legislation, boosts development of the country's High-Tech Park, a special economic zone the government wants to serve as a hub for tech and financial startups.  One component of the law provides a legal basis for companies working on smart contract development, token issuance, cryptocurrency trading and mining – all of which would be exempt from income taxes for the next five years.  The law states:  ""Turnovers, profits (income, proceeds) from various operations with tokens are not recognized as taxable items until January 2023.""  As reported  in July, the country's central bank had already been considering avenues for domestic banks to incorporate blockchain as part of a transaction guarantee system.  In another report published today, central bank chief Pavel Kallaur noted the push for the High-Tech Park to serve as a place for cryptocurrency businesses to set up shop.  ""As for cryptocurrencies, the Digital Economy Development Ordinance allows resident companies of the Hi-Tech Park to use cryptocurrencies for international deals.

The rout also marked a significant turnaround from the gains seen earlier this week.

42428337,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7Grh,1513962005,Cleaning Up the Crypto Markets: A Job for 2018,"Scott Ryan is a credit analyst and avid follower of the cryptocurrency markets.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      First things first: I'm quite fond of the Wild West environment in which we currently operate – the excitement and uncertainty are unparalleled by a night at the casino, let alone the current debt and equity markets.  And while the current environment is wrought with misinformation, pump-and-dump traders and scam coins, at the same time, it's bursting at the seams with innovation, partnerships with blue-chip corporations and thought leaders of the modern era. Finding a treasure after sifting through so much garbage is exhilarating.  If there's one thing I've learned in life, however, it's that change is inevitable, but not always bad.  If we are to achieve the global recognition and acceptance we desire, this exuberance must be tamed, and regulation must be put in place.  Fake news  There are serious issues with the way crypto asset news and research are disseminated.  I'll focus on the market effect of a specific group (which I won't name). Look at the ZenCash chart below from immediately before and after this publication recommended ZenCash in October.  As soon as this publication announced its recommendation of ZenCash, the price skyrocketed from roughly $10 to about $25. Did something fundamentally change about ZenCash that warranted such a dramatic spike in value? I think not.  Sure, ZenCash could be a great investment; however, that’s not the point. Did the staff of the publication load up on ZenCash just before the announcement? Did they proceed to dump their investment on blind followers? Without identity, regulation and disclosure requirements, there is no way to answer these questions.  Imagine if it were legal for equity research analysts to short stocks just before publishing a sell recommendation on behalf of a major investment bank, or if financial advisors could purchase a stock just before recommending it to their clients. Now that the aforementioned publication has a cult-like following, there is nothing to stop them from loading up on their ""coin of the month"" just before the announcement, and regardless of which coin they recommend, the following they've garnered will create a self-fulfilling prophecy.  What we need is unbiased, legitimate research published by intelligent, well-versed analysts who care solely about informing the community, and not about making a quick buck. The truth is that unbiased research is not possible without a third-party to regulate it.  As much as I'd like to trust the people I’ve met in telegram channels, they’re also experts at Photoshop, FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) and amplifying fake news. While I believe decentralization and trustless networks will displace many centralized institutions, unbiased research is impossible without regulators' help.  Happy medium  I clearly support a more regulated crypto asset market, but there are many things I don't like about the regulatory framework of traditional markets. I don't like the definition of an accredited investor (as if being wealthy immediately makes you a more knowledgeable, responsible investor). I don’t like the ridiculous number of hoops one needs to jump through to raise money.  The current system for debt and equity investments is undoubtedly designed for the rich to get richer, with barriers to entry that sometimes are insurmountable.  What I propose is a happy medium, and the best way to achieve this is to be proactive.  We already have the means to give regulators much of what they require. Without shilling anything specific, we have identity management dapps to help with KYC, immutable blockchains to show all our purchases and automated contracts to create trust.  What we're lacking, however, is the standardized infrastructure to bring it all together.  In the spirit of decentralization, as a community, let's create our own framework, one that protects investors from thieves and pump-and-dumps, but also shatters the barrier between the rich and poor. We all should have the right to invest how we see fit, but also have the peace of mind knowing that criminals will face consequences.  No one wants to support terrorism, money laundering or other organized crime, and the best way to resolve this stigma is to attach our identity to our transactions. If we try to regulate ourselves before regulators intervene, perhaps blockchain technology won’t be just a technological advancement, but also a societal one.  Conclusion  There is a paradox at play when we think about our goal of mass adoption combined with our fear of regulation. It’s simply impossible to have one without the other.  We can’t have unbiased research or trustworthy exchanges without regulatory bodies to keep them honest. In the short term, yes, regulation will decrease liquidity and damage valuations.  But if the market can recover from a blanket ban of all exchanges and initial coin offerings in China, it can certainly recover from the institution of regulatory framework around identity and accountability.  So, let us take that one step back, but forget two steps forward: let's go straight to the moon.  Regulation not your cup of tea? CoinDesk is accepting submissions to its 2017 in Review.

Firms like Long Island Iced Tea (which this week declared that it would rebrand as ""Long Blockchain Corp""), Riot Blockchain and LongFin are down, according to available market data.  The developments are a notable one, given that the past days have seen numerous reports about little-known firms – some of which specialized in the sale of, say, iced tea or electronic trading tools – that see their stock prices jump virtually overnight once they announce that they are moving to develop products or services around the tech. It's a state of affairs that has arguably raised eyebrows among some observers and sparked warnings from the SEC as well as groups like FINRA about the risk of pump-and-dump scams.  As it stands, many of those firms are witnessing declines as of the market opening today.  Long Island, for example, dropped more than 18 percent at the market open this morning, Yahoo! Finance data indicates.  Riot Blockchain is down roughly 7 percent from yesterday's close, after dropping sharply in a movement similar to the one seen in the Long Island chart.  By comparison, LongFin is down about 9.6 percent. Indeed, its decline is a notable development given that the price jumped sharply from $36.76 to $142.82 after it announced that it had acquired a company said to be focused on blockchain development.  To be sure, today's price declines aren't as severe as the ongoing correction being seen in cryptocurrency markets, as CoinDesk reported this morning. For a detailed look at some of the charts that show this morning's price action, click here.  At the same time, the public stocks are seen by some observers as a proxy for interest in – as well as the hype around – the tech by traditional investors.

At press time, the total value of all cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and the 1,300 others trading, is down more than 30 percent from its all-time high of $650 billion reached earlier this week. But while the markets hit a low of $418 billion today, year-over-year the markets are still up 4,000 percent, from just under $10 billion on Jan. 1, 2017.  So, is the market selling to buy holiday gifts? Or are evil bankers at work in the market?  While theories abound, the data is indisputable: The price of bitcoin fell nearly $5,000 in just hours to drop below $11,000, and many other cryptocurrencies have followed its downward trend, dropping 30 to 40 percent over the day's trading.  At $10,800, the price of bitcoin was nearly half of what it was when it topped $19,783 last Sunday.  Bitcoin leads  Leading the downward trend has been bitcoin, the market's most well-known asset, which after opening the day above $15,000 has since been trending down.

As quoted by state-owned news service TASS, Herman Gref, Sberbank's chairman of the board, indicated on Thursday that the institution could roll out products based on the tech as early as next year.  But the wider adoption of blockchain could take much longer than that, according to the Sberbank chief.  Gref was quoted as saying:  ""If we talk about Russia, we have the largest number of implemented projects concerning blockchain. Although, they are all in the experimental mode. We are experimenting a lot. Maybe in 2018 we will be able to introduce some products on a large scale. The blockchain technology is one of our tricks. I estimate the implementation horizon of the technology in 8 [to] 10 years.""  In the interview, Gref specifically noted that commercial use of the ethereum blockchain could begin playing out of the next year or two. Sberbank became a member of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance back in October, as previously reported by CoinDesk.  ""The technology is not yet ready for commercial implementation, it will take another year, maybe a year and a half or two, so that we can start using it,"" he remarked.  Gref has predicted a longer timeline for blockchain adoption in the past, as previously reported.

According to Cboe's website, the firm submitted proposed rule changes that would clear the way for listing the following ETFs: the First Trust Bitcoin Strategy ETF, the First Trust Inverse Bitcoin Strategy ETF, the GraniteShares Bitcoin ETF, the GraniteShares Short Bitcoin ETF, the REX Bitcoin Strategy ETF and the REX Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF.  The proposed rule changes were filed with the SEC between Dec. 15 and Dec. 19.  The pace of the filings is notable given that Cboe launched its first bitcoin futures contracts 11 days ago, with the first of the ETF filing coming just days after the product first went live.  Compared to past bitcoin-related ETF efforts, the six in question would track the performance of futures rather than the digital asset itself.  That latter approach, seen in submissions like the long-running one from investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has run into repeated opposition from the SEC. The agency had cast a critical eye on the state of the cryptocurrency market when it rejected the Winklevoss ETF last spring, though the SEC has since moved to review of that decision.  Efforts to list futures ETFs may not fare much better. As CoinDesk previously reported, firms like VanEck had to withdraw their push to create long and short-style ETFs around bitcoin futures because such products hadn't yet been successfully released and traded.  Whether the SEC shifts its view in light of the Cboe release as well as last weekend's launch by CME Group remains to be seen.

At press time, the price of bitcoin, the market's largest asset, was trading below $14,000 according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), up slightly from a daily low of $12,504. Notably, this figure was more than 30 percent below an all-time high of near $20,000 reached on Sunday.  But whereas earlier this week bitcoin's decline coincided with an increase in the total value of the market as a whole, the value of all cryptocurrencies saw a reversal on Thursday, dropping roughly 25 percent from a high above $650 billion to a low of $480 billion today.  All told, only a few assets seem safe from what appears to be an exodus from the cryptocurrency markets, with Ripple's XRP, and relatively little-known ICO tokens for GameCredits and Electroneum, posting 24-hour gains.  Ripple's XRP cryptocurrency, which powers the company's open-source XRP Ledger, hit an all-time high above $1.30 yesterday, a figure that was up nearly 400 percent from its value at the beginning of the month, when it traded at just $0.25.  That's not to say there aren't inter-day gains to be had in the market.  CoinDesk data from Friday's morning trading session (6:00 to 12:00 UTC) indicates that cryptocurrencies NXT and Bitcoin Dark both posted gains above 15 percent within the six-hour period, though they were the only assets to gain more than 2 percent.  Still, big losses were observed during the stretch as well, with Ripple's XRP down more than 12 percent for the window, and cryptocurrenices monacoin, TRON and RaiBlocks posting losses in excess of 15 percent.

As previously reported, Wikileaks started collecting donations in zcash in August, a move that followed its acceptance of bitcoin and litecoin.  Overall, Assange sees the FPF shutdown as ""richly ironic"" since it the organization was founded to stop economic censorship against Wikileaks.  He stated:  ""Like our response to the first banking blockade, (Wikileaks) will open up additional crypto-currencies. Those wanting to contribute to Wikileaks can already use bitcoin, litecon and the ultra-private monero and zcash.""  He added that users can also purchase Wikileaks merchandise on its online shop can already use a variety of payment methods including cryptocurrencies.  Wikileaks announced Thursday the arrival of its first WikiLeaks CryptoKitties. An internet-based game for buying, selling and breeding digital kittens, CryptoKitties are a form of cryptographic collectible built on the ethereum blockchain.

42428316,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7ADh,1513936821,"Buying Bitcoin? Hedge Funds Will Use Blockchain, Too","Mona El Isa is co-founder and member of the board at Melonport AG, a decentralized digital asset management platform, and a former VP of equities trading at Goldman Sachs.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      Imagine a future where humans play a minimal role in setting up, regulating and reporting regulatory requirements of investment funds, where the process is underpinned by reliable, cutting-edge technology.  It's a future that's not as far away as you might think, and it's not being built by an existing bank or institution that you will have heard of.  Instead, it is being built by a new group of technical pioneers who were early to blockchain and understood what it meant. These entrepreneurs are now working on a full toolkit that is fast becoming available.  Already, there are distinct innovations emerging across what can best be described as the emerging investment management chain.  Protocols are being built that allow you to:  Bring data securely to the blockchain (e.g. Oraclize)  Exchange assets in a secure, peer-to-peer way (decentralized or hybrid exchanges like 0x, Kyber, Oasisdex, etc)  Issue all sorts of digital assets on-chain (protocol tokens, ETFs, regulated equities, derivatives, etc)  Set up and regulate your investment funds.  Yet, these projects are an example of a crucial point – if all these projects were working in isolation, the concept probably wouldn't pose a credible alternative to the existing financial system.  However, the exact opposite seems to be true – bridges and highways are being built through network effects, securing an ecosystem which collectively gets stronger and stronger by the day.  Fitting in  Yet building a business in this environment isn't conventional.  To start, Melon offers a protocol, one important technology link that magnifies the network effects of the ecosystem. Our role is allowing users to set up and manage a technology regulated investment fund pre-defining a rule-set for your investment fund in a matter of moments.  The goal is to take what today occurs in a few months (and involves a couple of hundred thousand dollars) and replace it with an automated alternative.  You get to choose what risk limits your fund has, what fees you want to charge, what pricing source the fund accounting is based on, which assets and exchanges the manager is allowed to interact with and which investors are allowed to invest in your fund. All these rules are written in code and enforced by an unbiased, efficient, transparent technology commonly referred to as blockchain and adhere to blockchain accounting standards.  By following a standard template – any exchange protocols, data feed providers, digital KYC/AML companies or asset issuers can link their product suite to Melon's open-source protocol making it an available option to users.  From a user perspective, it would feel like going into an ""app-store"" for investment funds and picking out the different service providers you want to plug into your fund structure to meet the criteria you need to meet.  This gives regulators and investors the security and transparency around reporting, we also remove entirely the idea of human ""conflict of interest.""  User adoption curve  But, we are just beginning, and limitations still exist.  Like many other protocol providers, the first limit is around regulation. There are certain fund laws that are not fit for modern technology. Some of the current laws were simply created in a different time, without consideration of all available technology available. As an example, most funds today must have a custodian and fund administrator by law.  A custodian typically acts as safekeeper of the fund's assets and the fund administrator typically takes care of accounting, auditing, risk management, compliance (KYC/AML), investments/redemptions and regulatory reporting.  On top of that, it is pretty standard practice that for every investment professional in a medium-sized investment fund, there will be four non-investment professionals (ie. legal, support, operational, fund-administrator focused, trade reconciliation, custody, risk management, auditing… and the list goes on).  What if we could automate the fund administration and support function entirely by smart-contract code and allow investors to own full custody of their assets at all times, while still partaking investment fund strategies?  There is no reason why regulation shouldn't catch up to technology.  Another limitation is that today, the range of traditional investment fund assets, like fiat currencies and equities, aren't available on a blockchain. A fund that operates in a technology regulated environment will have to use modern digital assets like tokens and can’t deal with paper-based certificates.  However, traditional assets are fast becoming tokenized and we're just getting started.  We don’t have to look very far with Daimler recently issuing the first bond on blockchain technology, companies like Neufund, Jibrel network, Overstock and Otonomos working to put regulated equities on-chain or several central banks making public their plans to tokenize fiat currencies.  It's just a matter of time before every asset class we know will be digital simply because it is more efficient, transparent and secure. In which case, it’s not too long until we can imagine a fund management world which is entirely run by digital rule-sets and transparent processes.  Crypto fund paradox  Crypto funds today are emerging left, right and center in an attempt to gain investment exposure to this new class of blockchain innovators.  The irony is, that despite all the new technology surfacing, crypto funds can be even more expensive to set up and run than traditional funds. This can be seen in some of the fees they are charging. It is typical to see higher fee structures for crypto funds than traditional asset funds.  A large part of these high costs are related to the fact that investment fund laws have been created for the ""old world"" and simply don't account for or understand technology like blockchain. This means that new crypto fund launches are having to squeeze into existing rules and regulations designed for a different system.  Going back to the example of investment fund law requiring fund administrators. Fund administrators are extremely expensive and mostly not ready or equipped to deal with crypto assets. However, many of them are still taking on crypto fund clients and charging handsomely for it, without necessarily solving all the problems (or charging extra for the hassle).  The crypto investment funds are likely to be the first to shift, but there’s no doubt that when traditional funds see evidence of how much they can trim their everyday cost basis and pain-points by, they’ll be quick to follow.  And by then, we believe all traditional assets will be tokenized.  Why wouldn’t they be?  See a different future for crypto hedge funds? CoinDesk is accepting submissions to its 2017 in Review.

Before opening her practice, she worked in senior roles at NYSE Euronext, Barclays and Citigroup Global Markets, as well as at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's Enforcement Division.  This article is not meant to provide legal advice.      The Securities and Exchange Commission's Munchee order has given the token market plenty to munch on.  In fact, the order offers the most significant insight into the SEC's views of how to analyze ICOs under the securities laws since its July 25 report regarding The DAO offering.  To recap: On December 11, the regulator issued an administrative order accepting an offer of settlement from Munchee Inc. The startup had launched an initial coin offering to raise $15 million to improve its Munchee App by building an ecosystem of users who were to write restaurant reviews, provide advertising opportunities to restaurants and allow token holders to use the tokens to buy meals and drinks.  On the second day that its tokens were available for sale, Munchee stopped the offering after being contacted by SEC staff, and refunded the funds paid by buyers who had bought tokens.  Notwithstanding Munchee's assertion that it ""had done a 'Howey analysis' and that 'as currently designed the sale of [the Munchee] utility tokens does not pose a significant risk of implicating federal securities laws,'"" the SEC disagreed.  Recall that in its DAO report, the SEC for the first time analyzed a token offering under the Howey test to determine whether the token offering was a securities offering. Under the Howey test, a product is an ""investment contract"" and therefore a security if it involves (1) the investment of money (2) in a common enterprise with (3) a reasonable expectation of profits which (4) are to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.  But the SEC's Munchee order provides significant additional insight into how SEC staffers think about six common elements of many ICOs in their determination whether an ICO is a securities offering under the Howey test: (1) whether the tokens are immediately usable, (2) the buyers' expectation whether the tokens will rise in value, (3) whether an expected rise in value will be derived from the efforts of others, (4) whether there will be a secondary market for the tokens, (5) how the ICO offering is advertised, and (6) how the proceeds of the ICO are to be used.  Below is a menu of takeaways from the SEC's comments on these six common elements. ICO issuers who wish to avoid being found to be issuing securities may want to avoid combinations of the following dishes, and in particular, the same combination of the dishes that Munchee was serving.  Immediately usable  The order notes that ""no one was able to buy any good or service with [the Munchee tokens] throughout the relevant period."" Presumably, the relevant period is during the offering and before Munchee added the functionality to the app to buy meals with the tokens.  Many lawyers advising ICO issuers have thought that if the token is not usable as soon as it was sold, this was a very strong factor weighing in favor the token being found to be a security, and if a token was immediately usable that it would be a strong factor weighing against it being a security.  Even though the Munchee token was not immediately usable, the SEC cautioned against reasoning that if a token is immediately usable that is a strong factor for it not to be a security:  ""Even if the Munchee tokens had a practical use at the time of the offering, it would not preclude the token from being a security. Determining whether a transaction involves a security does not turn on labelling – such as characterizing an ICO as involving a 'utility token' – but instead requires an assessment of 'the economic realities underlying a transaction.' All of the relevant facts and circumstances are considered in making that determination.""  Takeaway: Even immediately usable tokens can be securities, depending on all the facts and circumstances of the ICO.  Buyers' expectations  The order observes that Munchee's white paper emphasized that the ""ecosystem"" that it was to create allowing diners and restaurants to use the tokens in various ways would cause the tokens to rise in value.  It also stated that Munchee would run the company in a way to cause the tokens to rise in value such as ""burning tokens"" to restrict supply.  From these statements, the order concludes: ""Purchasers would reasonably believe they could profit by holding or trading [Munchee] tokens, whether or not they ever used the Munchee App or otherwise participated in the [Munchee] 'ecosystem,' based on [the white paper].""  Takeaway: The not-uncommon claims from ICO promoters that their tokens will appreciate in value are consistent with an investor's intent, not a user's intent. For example, back in the day, people bought travelers' checks not because they thought they would go up in value, but because they wanted to use them as a safe way to transport monetary value.  Efforts of others  The order notes that Munchee's website, advertising and white paper reasoned that the tokens would rise in value because ""Munchee and its agents could be relied on to provide the significant entrepreneurial and managerial efforts required to make [the Munchee] tokens a success.""  Representations that management of an ICO issuer will upgrade the functionality of the platform or the tokens themselves in the future are common.  Takeaway: If the promise of future improvements by the ICO issuer are combined with the issuer's claims that token holders will profit by a related increase in value, that will satisfy the prong of the Howey test whether the investor reasonably expects to profit from the efforts of others.  Secondary market  The order observes that Munchee's white paper stated ""Munchee will ensure that [the Munchee] token is available on a number of exchanges in varying jurisdictions to ensure that this is an option for all token-holders.""  Specifically, Munchee said that the ""tokens would be available for trading on at least one U.S.-based exchange within 30 days of the conclusion of the"" ICO, the SEC said. ""Munchee highlighted that it would ensure [a] secondary trading market for [the] tokens would be available shortly after the completion of the offering and prior to the creation of the ecosystem.""  In other words, token holders could profit from Munchee's efforts to establish and support a secondary market without ever using the tokens to buy a good or service.  Takeaway: If an ICO issuer is promising to maintain a secondary market, it is less likely that the token will be seen simply as a utility token. With a secondary market, a token holder can profit without ever using the token for the purpose it was made for. This is especially the case if the secondary market will exist prior to the token being usable for its intended purpose.  Manner of advertising  The order notes that Munchee had advertised and marketed the token offering broadly on its website and message boards, likening the Munchee tokens ""to prior ICOs and digital assets that had created profits for investors.""  Moreover, the SEC observed that to the extent Munchee had a focus of its marketing it was to people interested in digital assets and the profits earned by investing in such assets as opposed to members of the restaurant industry, promoting how the tokens ""might let them advertise in the future,"" or otherwise use the tokens in their restaurants' businesses.  Takeaway: Marketing an ICO to the general public, or to groups focused on digital asset investments, rather than the members of the industry who would use the token in the ordinary course of their business, tends to show that the token is really an investment or a security rather than a true utility token.  Use of proceeds  The order comments on how Munchee told token buyers the proceeds of their purchases would be used:  ""The proceeds of the [Munchee] token offering were intended to be used by Munchee to build an 'ecosystem' that would create demand for [Munchee] tokens and make [the] tokens more valuable. Munchee was to revise the Munchee App so that people could buy and sell services using [the] tokens and was to recruit 'partners' such as restaurants willing to sell meals for [the] tokens.""  Takeaway: Where the proceeds of the token offering are used to promote the general corporate purposes of the issuer, rather than being held in escrow or invested in a hedging transaction to help provide the good or service that the buyer can exchange a token for in the future, the ICO appears to be more of an investment rather than a deferred purchase of a good or service not implicating the securities laws.

42428313,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7AJh,1513918801,Jamming on Crypto Economics: What Comes After the Summer of Love?,"Ryan Zurrer is principal and venture partner at Polychain Capital, where he leads investments in decentralized blockchain protocols and distributed projects.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      With that in mind, I have been calling summer 2017 the ""Summer of Crypto Love.""  Here in San Francisco, it was the 50th anniversary of the ""Summer of Love"" – a magical unique moment where artists and intellectuals came together to explore new ways of thinking. But this summer, which was just as astounding, was defined by everyone's love for crypto.  The scope of the impact that blockchain technologies will have in reorganizing capital and intelligence (both human and machine) was recognized by business leaders all over the world. We saw extreme excitement for tokenized projects which drove high valuations in token crowdfunds (ICOs).  Clearly, there were examples of overvaluation in some assets, but discounting the ICO model as merely a bubble or temporary hysteria would miss the forest for the trees.  When a token is designed correctly and distributed thoughtfully to drive network effects, the leverage that a project can get from a massive globally distributed investor base is remarkable. Crowdfund participants contribute significant technical resources, evangelize and market the project and generally add value that is very difficult for even a very talented venture capitalist to match.  Capital is no longer a scarce resource because private VCs are no longer the gatekeepers of capital, so investors are being forced to actually deliver value-add for projects beyond writing a cheque.  I see this trend as generally positive and the natural evolution of the early-stage funding model.  Tuning up      But while the world was getting hyped on ICOs, here at the Polychain office, we were spending most of our time ""jamming"" on crypto-economic models with our portfolio entrepreneurs. The results have been very compelling.  In case you are unclear on the meaning of cryptoeconomics, it is the emerging field of study of how we use digital incentives to drive specific resources and behaviors on decentralized networks that lead to some globally desired result such as security or network effects.  I call the brainstorming process of designing the right cryptoeconomic model ""jamming,"" as a tip-of-the-hat to the music creation process. I observe that very few technologists possess the entire suite of competencies necessary to build a great crypto-economic model alone. It requires expertise in game theory, computer science, behavioural psychology, various fields of economics, math, logic, distributed computing, security and a deep understanding of blockchain technologies and their limitations.  So as in music, the best results are achieved when a fantastic group comes together and each talented individual shares their respective skills in a complementary fashion while being open minded to improvisation.          Anecdotally, this term has been inspired by my friend, the great musician and technologist Simon de la Rouviere, who is great to jam with either on music or on crypto-economics.  The following are some observations that have came from the many jam sessions of this year:  The block reward is returning  We are starting to see more projects plan to sell only a minority of their tokens to fund project development and instead intend to distribute their token over time to coherently incentivize an array network participants.  An elegantly designed block reward scheme (ideally adjusted periodically via a governance model) that incentivizes the different key players – keepers (i.e. miners, validators, etc.), core protocol devs, application devs, and the wider ecosystem participants is an incredibly powerful concept and will be important as the battle for developer mindshare intensifies moving forward.  In part, Juan Benet and his team at Protocol Labs can be credited for the return of the block reward. Juan decided to sell only 10 percent of his network in his high-profile SAFT round in August and instead prioritized the block reward with 70 percent of the filecoin allocation.  I predict this prudent design will drive an amazing amount of professionally operated storage providers to the IPFS network, pushing the cost for retail users to store their files on IPFS to nearly zero.  We remain in the 'infrastructure era' … for now  There is a thoughtful debate around protocol layer vs application layer as an investment thesis, and we recognize that there is considerable grey area in the classification of projects within the taxonomy of our ecosystem.  However, I observe that outlier value will continue to accrue deeper down the decentralized software stack known as Web3. We still have a long way to go to have adequate infrastructure for Web3 that will subsequently provide a platform for consumer applications at scale. We still require multiple orders of magnitude improvement on scalability, para-chain deployment, more robust developer tools and applications that make interacting with blockchain technologies far less cumbersome for non-technical users.  Yet, this industry moves faster than any other on the planet, and I’m confident that we will see the emergence of the ‘application era’ far sooner than we would guess today.  At the core of our thesis, Polychain remains laser focused on investing in and supporting the infrastructure layer of Web3, and there are two implications for the year ahead that we draw from this thesis – the emergence of Major Ecosystems & Meta Protocols.  Major ecosystems are maturing  Ethereum was the first ""major ecosystem"" to emerge beyond bitcoin and present a rich topography for open source developers to create decentralized applications and higher-layer protocols.  Entering 2018, we are seeing the emergence of other major ecosystems that have aggregated lessons learned and present considerable performance improvements above what is available today. These new major ecosystems will spawn their own communities of developers, entrepreneurs, researchers, investors, users, evangelists and so on.  Polkadot, Dfinity, Tezos, and Filecoin are all positioned to trigger a Cambrian explosion of innovation and novel applications across the space.  I'm incredibly excited to watch this story unfold in 2018 as all four of these major ecosystems will go live and begin to capture developer mindshare and notoriety and some will become crucial components of the decentralized web.  Meta-protocols are coming  One of the many amazing contributions to crypto-economics that my brilliant partner and the Founder of Polychain Capital, Olaf Carlson-Wee has made during our jam sessions is the idea of the ""meta-protocol.""  This is a protocol that is applicable to many different underlying blockchains and actual generates further security and network effects by supporting different ecosystems simultaneously. A great example of a meta-protocol is 1Protocol, which will be a relevant tool for staking across the space.  Other examples of meta-protocols are Truebit for off-chain computational verification, NuCypher for proxy re-encryption and Keep for private data management on-chain.  I offer a few other predictions for the year ahead:  Governance and DAOs – The next year will bring some high profile experiments with on-chain governance and we are excited to observe the results. The launch of Dfinity and Tezos will be the largest attempts to fully deploy on-chain governance. I am cautiously optimistic that we will also see the re-emergence of prominent DAOs in 2018, including DAOs that govern development of an underlying blockchain.  Functioning Applications – We are also on the cusp of seeing some really compelling applications within the ethereum community. Personally, I am very proud of the MakerDAO project that launched the Dai stable coin this month. This is one of the oldest projects in the ethereum community and is led by a very talented technical team. Instead of getting distracted with a flashy ICO, the MakerDAO team focused on building their project and the result is one of the first dapps that is robust and ready to scale.  Stablecoins – are critical to the larger crypto ecosystem so that businesses and smart contract systems can perform transactions on-chain without speculating on the underlying currency. Functional dapps will drive a new cohort of users to the space and accelerate the speed of mass adoption.    A bigger picture is forming  Through the emergence of crypto-economics, I believe the study of economics will forward more in the next 24 months then has occurred in the last 24 years.  While there are so many reasons for gratitude as we conclude this remarkable 2017, what I am most grateful for is to be able to come into the Polychain office every day to join a wicked-smart team that is constantly challenging my assumptions and theories on cryptoeconomics as we chart new territory.  I am incredibly lucky and deeply humbled to work closely with the top technical teams in the space, who come from all over the world to jam on their crypto-economic models and share lessons learned for the continued evolution of our community. The results of these jam sessions is what drives my great optimism for where we are headed in crypto.  Here’s to 2018 and more jamming on crypto-economics.

Prices fell to as low as $14,502 to start today's trading session, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), about 27 percent from the all-time high of $19,783 reported on Dec. 17.  Overall, bitcoin has seen several notable price drops following Sunday's gains, including a dip below $17,000 on Tuesday that accounted for a roughly $1,800 drop on the day. Indeed, analysts have suggested that the price could experience continued volatility as 2017 comes to a close and new money, brought in by bitcoin's meteoric gains, exits for fiat.  But, others may be testing the waters in alternative cryptocurrencies, as bitcoin is far from alone in having seen its price recently hit an all-time high.  According to data from OnChainFXhttps://onchainfx.com/v/KApsiV, which charts price developments for cryptocurrencies, all of the top-20 coins by market capitalization have seen an all-time high within the past four days. Of those, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin cash, dash and litecoin have since posted declines in the last 24 hours.
