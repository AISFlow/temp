42382580,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sE7N,1566855277,Judge Recommends Ruling in Favor of Kleiman in Craig Wright Case,"Craig Wright must turn over half of his bitcoin holdings and intellectual property to the estate of Dave Kleiman, a judge ruled Monday. The ruling applies to holdings and IP from before 2014.  Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart recommended that plaintiffs be awarded 50 percent of the bitcoin that Wright held prior to Dec. 31, 2013, as well as 50 percent of the intellectual property that Wright owned prior to Dec. 31, 2013, according to an individual familiar with the case.  Wright will also not be entitled to a jury trial and cannot oppose the order though he can appeal, the source said.  The case began in 2018, when Kleiman – the brother of Wright’s late business partner Dave Kleiman – sued for $10 billion, alleging that Wright was trying to seize Dave’s bitcoin holdings.  Kleiman was represented by Kyle Roche and Velvel Freedman of Roche Freedman LLP, while Wright was represented by Rivero Mestre LLP.  The case is not over yet. There are still procedural issues, including collection, that need to be hammered out. However, the substantive issues have been decided and this points to an end of a potentially lengthy trial.  According to the source, while Judge Reinhart did not find Wright to be credible, he did not make a finding on whether or not Wright was Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin’s creator.  Reinhart's order will have to be adopted by the District Judge, Beth Bloom, before becoming final. This also assumes that Wright's attorneys do not file any exceptions or objections.

The malware is based on the open source Hidden-Cryhttps://github.com/thelinuxchoice/hidden-cry program, an encryptor that appeared online last December and has been the basis for many bits of malware over the past year.  Image via Cyren  Home to some 250 million players, Fortnite users are a prime target for this kind of malware.  “Combining game malware with ransomware was inevitable,” said Chris Morales, head of security analytics at Vectra. “Social engineering through online video games has been going on for some time. It is a large audience to target and an industry that is known to look for shortcuts. Malware posing as a hack tool is novel as it will not be validated by any app store and bypasses the normal security controls. This makes encrypting files using a game hack highly opportunistic and easy to execute.”  Syrk targets Fortnite users by masquerading as a cheating app for the game. The Syrk malware appears as ""SydneyFortniteHacks.exe"" and when it is run the app begins encrypting files on the user's hard drive and USB drives. If a ransom isn't paid in crypto the app starts deleting one important folder after another, culminating in your Documents folder  “The next step is it will set a timed procedure to try and delete the encrypted files in the directories listed below, deleting the files every two hours in the following order: %userprofile%\Pictures; %userprofile%\Desktop; and %userprofile%\Documents,” the researchers wrote.  Luckily the malware is based on a known attack vector and the software is easy to circumvent. Victims can easily unlock their computers by looking for a few text files on their drives. These files contain the passwords use to shut down the ransomware before it can delete your files, a nice feature that should stop many from having to shell out crypto for a clean computer.    Given the ease with which users can disable the malware, it's not clear how many victims paid the crypto ransom the creators required.

The exchange, CoinFlex, launched in February of this year and says it is the first exchange to close futures contracts in bitcoin as opposed to a cash settlement. Speaking with the South China Morning Post, CoinFlex CEO Mark Lamb said the bitcoin futures market needs physical settlement due to price manipulation.  “Professional and retail traders alike are affected by price manipulation in the cash-settled futures market. In physically delivered contracts, anyone long at expiry receives the underlying bitcoin. There are no formulas involved,” he said.  Experienced traders are taking advantage of the lower bitcoin spot volume versus futures, Lamb says. Physical settlement helps alleviate manipulation.  Lamb told the SCMP that settling directly in bitcoin lowers the opportunity for price manipulation. Lamb says CoinFlex is shooting at top dog cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, which trades the second most bitcoin futures contracts at $2.86 billion daily in volume.  CoinFlex is not alone in its futures settlement goal, however. Intercontinental Exchange’s Bakkt announced this month testing for its physical settlement of bitcoin futures contracts. The exchange had previously announced its launch this past winter but has faced significant regulatory hurdles.

42382584,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sECP,1566832519,Overstock Loses Another Big Investor in Crypto Token Exchange tZERO,"After a long courtship, Overstock's security token platform, tZERO, has lost another potential investor.  ""Makara will not be investing in tZERO right now,"" Interim CEO Jonathan Johnson said during the Overstock investor call on Monday. Johnson did mention that the Singapore-based fund will keep an eye on tZERO and possibly reconsider its decision in the future.  It was Johnson's first investor call since taking the helm of the e-commerce company last week. Overstock founder Patrick Byrne abruptly resigned from the company on Aug. 22 following an earlier admission of a romantic relationship with Maria Butina, the Russian spy currently serving 18 months in federal prison.  As for Makara, the fund's departure appears to be the final nail in the coffin for a much-touted investment that considerably dwindled in size over the course of 2019.  Makara entered the fray in March as the co-lead of a $100 million investment in tZERO common stock, which at the time was expected to close in April. That target date came and went with Makara's partner, GSR Capital, ultimately investing just $5 million in May.  Makara was reportedly still conducting its due diligence on tZERO at the time, with Overstock's Q1 earnings report noting it was ""optimistic (but not certain)"" that the Makara deal would be ""consummated.""  That did not come to pass.  On the bright side, tZERO's other security token marketplace – the BSTX exchange for publicly-traded stocks built in partnership with the Boston Options Exchange – is on-track for launch.  ""We're working very closely with the regulators,"" tZERO CEO Saum Noursalehi said during the call, adding:  ""In Q1 of next year we'll be launching our national exchange for security tokens.""  Post-Byrne plans  With the Byrne bombshell dropping late last week, Overstock's current leadership did not avoid the elephant in the room.  Byrne's departure was not related to the current financial state of the company, Johnson said on the call. The move itself was ""a positive comment on the strength of the team and business,"" Johnson added, and Byrne ""would not leave if he didn't believe the business is in the good hands.""  Allison Abraham, the new head of Overstock's board of directors, said ""there was no severance or additional payments"" to Byrne upon his resignation. Bryne keeps his share in Medici, said Abraham, and the company will ""communicate with him like with any other shareholder.""  Stressing the point, Johnson added:  ""Patrick left the ship on a right course. My hands on the wheel are steady.""  As for the ongoing SEC investigation into tZERO's token sale that derailed Byrne's plans to sell Overstock's retail business, no developments have been announced. As tZERO's Noursalehi told CoinDesk earlier this month, the agency requested additional information in the May-June time period of this year, asking for “emails and content like that.”  Also announced on Monday's investor call, Medici Ventures, the blockchain-focused venture arm of Overstock, plans to invest $2 million in a digital identity company.  ""At this point, we're in the final stages to make a $2 million investment in a promising digital identity company, "" Johnson said, without naming the company.

42382586,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sEGB,1566825960,Crypto 'Exchange of Exchanges' ShortHop Expands to 7 US States,"ShortHop, an “exchange of exchanges” for cryptocurrency trading, has launched in seven additional U.S. states.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, the exchange and brokerage has opened for business in Indiana, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Arizona and Montana. The Wilmington, Del.-based ShortHop was already live in California, Washington and Illinois.  While the exchange’s parent company, technology provider Velocity Markets, is registered as a money services business (MSB) with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), ShortHop had to apply for money transmitter licenses in each state where it does business. The company also expects to be licensed in Utah and Pennsylvania next week.  As a ""spot fill market,"" ShortHop allows customers to transact digital asset listings from multiple order books on one screen in addition to its own orders to provide customers with the lowest price, said Velocity Markets CEO Jonathan Kelfer.  “You might find that when you go on Binance, the spot price for bitcoin is the quoted price. When you go on Gemini it’s the quoted price there as well,” Kelfer said, by way of example. “We’ll use that in aggregate to get the best price across the ecosystem.”  In this way, the company's model resembles those of Voyager and Fidelity Digital Asset Services, both of which act as brokers, helping customers find the best deals in a highly fragmented market. The difference is that ShortHop also has its own exchange.  “ShortHop is a spot market first, but we’re aggregating liquidity across the ecosystem,” Kelfer said, adding that the service is currently plugged into a total of eight exchanges and OTC desks.  ShortHop's organic orders get treated like any other order on the marketplace, but ""the more orders, the better the price,"" Kelfer said.  Skipping between assets  Kelfer founded the company in the early part of the initial coin offering (ICO) boom, seeing a need for reliable American exchanges.  “It was my perspective that there wasn’t a U.S.-based presence where people could reliably base these assets,” Kelfer said. “You really had to get on some Chinese exchange, because U.S. exchanges weren’t listing most of these tokens.""  Currently, ShortHop just lists a few major cryptocurrencies. Users can acquire and trade bitcoin, ether, litecoin, bitcoin cash, XRP and Stellar lumens (XLM). ShortHop also allows customers to “hop” between these assets without having to go through multiple conversions on different exchanges. Its technology accomplishes this by cross ordering books to create synthetic pairs.  Velocity Markets is also building a digital securities exchange. It owns a broker-dealer under the legal name Distributed Technology Markets that has an alternative trading system form on file at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The company will be using the broker-dealer license to enable the digital securities exchange, but the company would not disclose when it plans to launch.  Right now, new users on ShortHop’s platform receive $25 worth of bitcoin for signing up. The platform at the moment is feeless, and Kelfer plans to subsidize retail users by offering a plug-in service to institutions who want to connect to the exchange's capabilities.  “We'd rather do this than nickel-and-dime retail users who should have access to the same quality of infrastructure that large players do,” Kelfer said. “That’s not to say we won’t layer on fees in the future.”  Jonathan Kelfer image via Velocity Markets",POSITIVE,없음,BCH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/08/26/crypto-exchange-of-exchanges-shorthop-expands-to-7-us-states,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6604efc30e8886a2878e8a3d0e537f53e63c2c04-1194x796.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The annualized interest rate for the initial lending products with a 14-day fixed maturity term, has been set at 15 percent, 10 percent and seven percent, for BNB, USDT, and ETC, respectively.  Binance puts out a total subscription cap of 200,000 BNB, 5 million USDT and 20,000 ETC. If all the initially planned products get fully subscribed, Binance would pay out interests of 1,150 BNB, 19,178 USDT and 53 ETC, which worth about $50,000 as of press time.  Each user's account on Binance will have an initial hard cap for BNB-, USDT- and ETC-denominated lending products at 500 BNB, 1,000,000 USDT, and 1,000 ETC, respectively.  In the meantime, Binance's recently-launched margin trading business charges users who borrow BNB and USDT an annualized interest of as much as 109 percent and 10.0375 percent, respectively.  And just hours before the lending business announcement, Binance said on its website that starting from Aug. 27, it will increase the annualized margin borrow interest rate for ETC from previously 7.3 percent to 14.6 percent.  The company said it will be ""constantly evaluating new coins and tokens to support as lending products based on demand"" and new products will be revealed weekly on Monday and become available for subscription on Wednesday.  The plan may not be entirely surprising to some given CZ mentioned during a recent London event that the firm was planning to launch a lending business around mid August.  The launch is another move of Binance in its bid to diversify its business lines to attract and retain users weeks after it formally rolled out margin trading and borrowing in July and revealed plans to add futures trading on its platform.

The investment was not in the form of equity but via the purchase of Terra's Luna, a mining token which trades on Bittrex and Bitrue and is used to maintain the value of the Terra stablecoin. Created by Korean entrepreneur Danial Shin, who founded and chairs TMON, Terra launched in 2018 boasting a number of partners and customers.  Currently partnered with 25 ecommerce platforms in the region, its goal is to become the PayPal of Asia, or the next Alipay.  Terra, which is incorporated in Singapore as Terraform Labs, would not disclose the investment amount. HashKey did not respond to an email request for clarification.  Company executives say that the investment was related to the Terra's efforts to expand in the region, including China.  ""HashKey Capital has a great presence across Asia, especially in Hong Kong and Mainland China, and we look forward to exploring those regions together,” said Daniel Shin, cofounder of Terra.  HashKey was founded in 2018 and incorporated a number of entities in Hong Kong last year and early this year, according to the Companies Registry.  The company has been an active investor in recent months. According to Crunchbase data, it bought into in Hangzhou, China's Nervos Network on August 7, Santa Monica, California's Blockfolio on August 5, Singapore's AlphaWallet on July 30 and San Francisco's Kava Labs on July 29.  According to the Terra press release, HashKey Capital has a ""strategic partnership"" with Wanxiang Blockchain Labs, a Shanghai-based company which is funded by China Wanxiang Holdings, an insurance company. Wanxiang Blockchain Labs describes itself as a non-profit research group and says it is involved in the Chinaledger Alliance and China Blockchain Technology and Development Forum.  HashKey also lists Singapore's DBS, Shanghai's Fenbushi Capital and Zug, Switzerland's Dfinity as partners.  Terra has received a number of investments this year, according to Crunchbase. In May, Singapore's LuneX Ventures and Seattle-based Arrington XRP Capital invested. In February, Kakao Capital invested, as did Milan's Iconium. Earlier that same month, LuneX Ventures participated in a coin offering. The company's seed round was held in August 2018 and attracted 11 investors, while a coin offering was held earlier that same month.

42382635,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sEVH,1566817227,Weekly Bitcoin Price Indicator Shows 'Bear Cross' in First Since February,"View  Bitcoin's weekly moving average convergence divergence histogram has turned bearish for the first time in seven months. Even so, sellers need to observe caution as that indicator had trapped bears on the wrong side of the market during the 2015-2017 bull run.  A bull revival, however, would be confirmed if and when prices find sustained acceptance, preferably a weekly close (Sunday, UTC), above $12,000.  Short duration charts continue to call a move lower to $9,500. The bearish case would be negated if prices invalidate the lower highs setup seen on the daily chart with a move above $10,956 (Aug 20 high on Bitstamp).      A widely-tracked trend-following bitcoin (BTC) price indicator is flashing a sell signal for the first time since February.  The weekly moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram, which is used to identify trend reversals and trend strength, has crossed below zero and is currently printing a value of -25.13.  That is the first negative value since the first week of February. Back then, BTC was trading at $3,700. As of now, the leading cryptocurrency by market value is changing hands at $10,340 on Bitstamp, representing 2 percent gains on a 24-hour basis.  The histogram crossing below zero is considered a sign of the beginning of a new downtrend, while a move above zero is taken as confirmation of a bearish-to-bullish trend change.  MACD's bearish crossover  Histogram's latest drop below the zero lines indicates the rally from lows near $3,700 seen in the first week of February topped out at $13,880 in June and the bears have regained control.  Many observers consider MACD histogram as a lagging indicator. After all, it is a spread between two moving averages (MAs), which are based on past data.  Also, MACD's bearish crossovers marked an end of corrective pullbacks during the 2015-2017 bull market, as tweeted earlier today by popular analyst Murad Mahmudov.  MACD a contrary indicator  Bitcoin bottomed out in January 2015 near $150 and rose to a record high of $20,000 in December 2017. Throughout the bull run, BTC charted bullish higher lows with histogram's dip below zero (bearish crossover).  Put simply, MACD's bearish turn marked an end of corrective pullbacks and what followed was rise to fresh highs.  For instance, BTC's pullback from the November 2015 high of $502 ended near $360 with the weekly MACD falling below zero in February 2016. The cryptocurrency then picked up a strong bid in April and rose to highs near $800 by mid-June 2016.  On similar lines, BTC charted a higher low at $592 with the MACD's bearish turn in the first week of August 2016. Further, the negative MACD bar seen in March 2017 turned out to be a bear trap.  So, the latest bearish crossover on the MACD is a strong reason for sellers to observe caution – more so, as BTC is in a long-run bull market, as stated by Mahmudov.  That said, the outlook would turn bullish if and when BTC prints a weekly close (Sunday, UTC) above $12,000.  Weekly chart  BTC fell 10.49% in the second week of this month, strengthening the case for a deeper pullback put forward by the repeated failure to close above $12,000 seen in the preceding weeks.  Essentially, the rally from lows near $4,050 seen in April has stalled near $12,000 and a weekly close above that level is needed to confirm bullish revival.  Daily and 4-hour charts  Bitcoin has consistently found takers below $10,000 over the last eight weeks (above left).  However, recovery rallies from sub-$10,000 levels have been shallow, as represented by the falling trendline. That indicates a weakening of bullish momentum.  The cryptocurrency's inability to produce a stronger bounce from the 100-day moving average (MA) support line is also a cause of worry for the bulls.  Further, the rising wedge breakdown, a bearish reversal pattern, witnessed on the 4-hour chart (above right) last week is still valid.  All-in-all, the cryptocurrency remains in the hunt for a drop to the recent low of $9,467. The bearish case would weaken if prices rise above $10,956 (Aug. 20 high), invalidating the lower highs pattern on the daily chart.

42382588,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sEHR,1566806433,"Don't Worry, Overstock's New CEO Is Already 'Drunk on Bitcoin's Kool-Aid'","Digital retail platform Overstock.com’s new CEO is not planning any major changes to the company’s blockchain efforts after the departure of its founder.  Patrick Byrne, the now-former CEO of Overstock, made headlines Thursday after announcing his resignation as both the head of his company and a member of its board. He wrote in a letter to shareholders that he did not want to “disrupt possible strategic discussions” by remaining in his positions following his admission that he had a three-year relationship with Russian spy Maria Butina (at, according to Byrne, the FBI’s behest).  Over the past several years, Byrne has championed blockchain tools and projects, overseeing the growth of Medici Ventures, Overstock’s blockchain-focused subsidiary, and tZERO, the security token trading platform.  These projects will continue, said Jonathan Johnson, who was named interim CEO upon Byrne’s resignation.  “The fact that I am stepping into the CEO role means more of the same and more of the same focus for our blockchain business,” he said.  He told CoinDesk that he’s “all in” on Overstock’s blockchain efforts, noting that he had been running the day-to-day operations at Medici over the past three years and has even accepted his bonus in bitcoin in the past.  Johnson will retain his previous position as president of Medici concurrently with his new duties as interim Overstock CEO.  “I wasn’t just doing it for a paycheck, I’m doing it because I’m a full-on believer,” he said, adding:  “Not only have I drunk the Kool-Aid, I'm drunk on the Kool-Aid.”  As such, he does not expect much of Overstock, Medici or tZERO’s operations to change with his assuming command of the company.  “This isn’t an example of the board [of directors] saying, ‘We need a new CEO because the vision’s wrong,’” he said.  Specifically, Medici Ventures will continue to grow its portfolio, albeit more slowly than it has over the past three years.  Johnson said during Overstock’s Q2 earnings call earlier this month that the company would be less aggressive about growing its keiretsu (a Japanese term for a group of interlocking businesses), a statement he echoed Friday.  “We’re not stopping building out the keiretsu,” he said, adding that the company intends in particular to “flesh out the identity column.”  However, he noted, “In the last three years we’ve gone from four to 18 [portfolio companies],” and this rate would slow.  Moving forward  While Johnson does not have any specific plans at this stage for where to take Overstock, he expressed support for the various blockchain projects and hinted that the digital retail platform may begin accepting additional cryptocurrencies as payment methods (Overstock has accepted bitcoin since 2014).  “I would love to see Overstock accepting ravencoin, I just think that would be great. My view is any kind of widely accepted cryptocurrency, Overstock should be accepting,” Johnson said.  He did not speak to when Overstock may begin accepting other cryptocurrencies, noting he was “less than 24 hours into this.”  As for Overstock’s blockchain-focused subsidiaries, Johnson said they too will continue.  “I’m fully behind what we’re doing at tZERO, I’m chairman of the board,” he said.  Since its launch, tZERO has seen a limited amount of trading volume. The company opened the platform to non-accredited investors on Aug. 12, which likewise has not yet resulted in any massive growth.  Asked about what sort of timeline he was looking at before reassessing tZERO, Johnson said:  ""I think the question is, once tZERO has five or 10 quality tokens trading on the exchange, ‘What has that done to the overall liquidity on the exchange?’ I think it’s about bringing in quality tokens not [putting it on a timeline].""  He also pointed to Voatz and Bitt as examples of two other portfolio companies Medici will continue to support.  ""Someday in the not too distant future everyone’s voting on mobile phones on a blockchain app and we’ll wonder 'How did we do it the old way?'""he said of Voatz in particular.  Overstock will hold an investor call on Aug. 26 at 8:30 a.m. EDT, where Johnson will seek to reassure shareholders.  ""[The crypto community] should not see it as a seismic tremor, they should just see it as a passing of the baton,"" he said.

Kunal Kalra, also known as ""Kumar,"" “shecklemayne” and “coinman,"" was indicted on Friday for allegedly trading cash and crypto for individuals including drug dealers, partially via his bitcoin ATM kiosk.  An announcement from the U.S. Justice Department last Friday said Kalra, who is expected to make his first court appearance next month, has agreed to plead guilty to the charges.  The release alleges Kalra ran an unlicensed crypto exchange business from May 2015 through October 2017. He admitted in his plea deal for having exchanged bitcoin for cash from criminals including drug dealers who obtained the cryptocurrency from selling narcotics on the darknet.  The justice department went on to say that without implementing an anti-money laundering program, Kalra facilitated such type of transactions with a commission while knowing the proceeds came from drug trafficking.  As part of the investigation, the law enforcement seized about $889,000 in cash from Kalra and about 54.3 bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, worth more than half-million dollars. The announcement said the maximum penalty Kalra could face is to serve a life time behind bars.  Meanwhile, a 32-year-old Australian national living in the state of Colorado has been sentenced to one year in jail after being convicted for money laundering with bitcoin, based on a U.S. Justice Department release also on Friday.  The convict, named Emilio Testa, facilitated trades between bitcoin and cash with undercover agents while knowing the proceeds were part of narcotics trafficking.

42382579,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sBV5,1566788108,The Faketoshi Circus: Even Bitcoin Can't Escape the Politics of Money,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      In case you missed it, a new self-proclaimed Satoshi Nakamoto came out of the woodwork last week, this one brandishing a “proof” based on numerology and an obsession with BCCI, the scandal-ridden bank that collapsed in 1991.  The widely debunked “reveal” from Bilal Khalid, aka James Caan – Khalid officially changed his name to that of the American actor – followed a host of equally absurd developments in a Florida court case against the other “Faketoshi,” Craig S. Wright. These included a hand-written note to the judge in which yet another person, one Debo Jurgen Etienne Guido, also laid claim to being bitcoin’s secret progenitor.  Sensible minds in the crypto community remind us that this is all a sideshow, that these competing claims to bitcoin’s creation ultimately mean nothing to its value proposition.  Still, it begs the question: why does it keep happening? Why do the scammers emerge so readily? What is about the crypto community that attracts a parade of false prophets?  Let’s take the question further: why does crypto generate so much drama generally? Bitter feuds over software forks; relentless conspiracy theories; disputes between maximalists, altcoiners, nocoiners and shitcoiners; competing social media memes; token “armies;” Twitter trolls; fraudsters of all kinds – it’s the crypto circus, and many of us secretly love it, at least in doses.  But why? How did a technology spawned by the most math-driven, nerdy and precision-obsessed fields of computer science give rise to Mexican telenovela-like stream of plot twists?  Other open-source tech communities generate their fair share of drama too, of course. (Type in “Linux community” into a Google search and it auto-completes to “Linux community toxic.”) The leaderless structure of open-source projects means there's no central authority or pooled profit interest policing behavior or managing the external messaging.  Still, the crypto soap opera takes things to another level of madness. Why?  Learning from ancient history  My attempt at an explanation begins with the fact that, unlike other technologies, this is one is fundamentally about money.  “Money has historically been a political process, a process through which people or states or some kind of entity consolidates authority over others,” says Bill Maurer, Dean of Social Sciences at the University of California, Irvine, an anthropologist who has studied the culture and history of money, adding:  “So, you have this big paradox with something like bitcoin, where its very idea is that there shouldn’t be any one person or authority in control…But because of that, you get this cacophony of voices, each claiming to have some kind of truth and striving to be the one in control.”  The unfortunate reality is that while decentralized, blockchain-based monetary systems restrain political or corporate influences over those systems, this restraint only exists on-chain. There’s no way to stop the power plays – the politics – that emerge whenever someone wants to upgrade or fork the software or when different coins compete for users. There is no escaping the politics of money; it doesn’t disappear just because there’s no government in charge of the monetary policy.  Powerful people have always imposed their ideas of money onto others to reinforce their wealth and dominance.  Maurer notes that the emergence of gold and silver as dominant currencies in the ancient world stemmed because of the fact that wealthy elites had previously acquired status objects composed of precious metals. As they consolidated their power over government and laws, they made those metals currency standards.  Bitcoin has its equivalents of those ancient elites. Big mining firms, early adopters/investors, and core developers all have an oversized interest in promoting it. The same goes for the “whales” of Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV, ether and other cryptocurrencies.  This isn’t to say the crypto elites don’t deserve rewards for being early to the game or for helping to develop and secure an ingenious new form of money. Nor can one equate the power they wield – all within a system that doesn’t actively prohibit anyone from mining, owning or contributing code to bitcoin – with that of governments that use military might and judicial threats to control access to their money.  I raise it simply to point out that these influential players are both incentivized and financially enabled to aggressively push and promote their positions.  Believers gonna believe  These competing, financially enabled voices are battling for the minds of users, which means they’re appealing to people’s passions and emotions.  It’s unavoidable. You can be as nerdy and detached as the most cerebral cryptographer, but if you want your favored currency to grow to the point that it becomes money, you must engage in cultural production. You want a shared story of belonging to develop around it, one that’s widely accepted enough that your currency is widely held and used.  Of course, you also need your currency to have intrinsic qualities – those of scarcity, fungibility, transportability, durability and divisibility are common to both gold and bitcoin, for example. But in and of themselves, they aren’t sufficient. For something to become money, it needs belief.  Here we enter into the realm of myths and storytelling, the foundations upon which the most powerful systems of human organization are built – nations, religions, brands and, most of all, money.  Think of the importance attached to the unknown identity of bitcoin’s founder. It not only denied critics a target to accuse of running a get-rich-quick scheme; it gave the bitcoin community its genesis myth. That, in turn, has fed the posturing over Bitcoin Cash and Wright’s Bitcoin SV, the latter’s name alluding unabashedly to the prophet-like notion of “Satoshi’s Vision.”  But here’s the thing: “believers” are vulnerable to manipulation. (Just look at how the powerful have gotten religious communities to do their dirty work through the ages, from priests and mullahs stirring up “ethnic cleansings” to America’s televangelists fleecing their congregations.) Sadly, the increasingly wide communities interested in cryptocurrencies are similarly vulnerable – the thousands hoodwinked into BitConnect, for example.  And in a situation where specialized knowledge about the complex workings of cryptocurrency is limited, those vulnerabilities are heightened for the many who don’t fully grasp the tech.  “Because it’s supposed to be about the code and the mathematics, and not everyone understands the code and the mathematics, people take advantage of that to try to sell you whatever they want to sell,” says Maurer. “People are desperate to have a firmer foundation for their beliefs. So, it’s easier to fall for someone that offers that to them.”  I’m not saying the “trust in code” mantra isn’t useful when applied to the decentralized management of a cryptocurrency’s monetary policy or payments system. But it’s naïve to believe the human networks gathered around this technology are somehow immune to the failings of humanity itself. Worse, that belief enables the scammers.  So, if we want to rid ourselves of the Faketoshis, snake oil salesmen, and general cultural chaos of crypto, it’s up to we humans, not the code or the coders per se, to come up with ways to mitigate those failings. Human governance matters.  Alternatively, we could just leave things as they are. Sit back, grab some popcorn. Enjoy the circus.
