28937217,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=611435,1717542041,"Crypto King Reclaims Throne: Bitcoin Soars To $71,000, How Much Higher Can It Go?","Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency in the market, has once again surged past the significant milestone of $70,000. After a brief period of consolidation between $67,000 and $69,000, the price faced strong resistance at this level. However, the bullish momentum suggests that Bitcoin may consolidate above $70,000, paving the way for a potential retest of the next resistance at $71,300 and a potential climb towards its all-time high (ATH) of $73,700 reached in March. The question remains: Will BTC sustain this anticipated upward movement and surge even further? Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Surge To $74,400 Crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted the significance of Bitcoin breaking out from a symmetrical triangle on the BTC/USD 1-hour chart. Suppose the breakout is confirmed by a sustained close above the $69,330 resistance level. In that case, Martinez believes it could propel BTC to $74,400, setting a new all-time high and positioning it favorably to conquer even higher levels. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Massive Solana Price Crash Using Elliott Waves Martinez also emphasizes Bitcoin’s current positioning above the +0.5σ pricing band. According to the analyst, if BTC holds above this band, it will likely rise and test the 1.0σ pricing band at $79,600. Another analyst, Rekt Capital, points out that Bitcoin is again at the Range High of the ReAccumulation Range. For Rekt, the outlook for Bitcoin remains unchanged, with the cryptocurrency being just one weekly close above the Range High away from entering the Parabolic Phase of its market cycle. BTC’s Cycle Acceleration Signals Ongoing Bullish Trend In addition to the analysis provided by Rekt Capital, it is worth noting that Bitcoin’s recent rally to new all-time highs in mid-March exhibited an accelerated cycle compared to previous market cycles. Rekt Capital observed that the cycle was accelerating by 260 days. However, due to Bitcoin’s multi-month consolidation since then, the rate of acceleration has dropped to approximately 170 days. Despite the adjustment, the cycle remains accelerated, and a breakthrough beyond the $73,700 level would indicate that the accelerated cycle is likely to continue. Market expert Crypto Con supports the notion that Bitcoin will maintain its positive trajectory until the end of 2024, based on the analysis of the 90-day realized profit/loss ratio (RPLR). According to Crypto Con, the first move over an RPLR value of 11 has been completed, aligning with previous cycles that have witnessed a top at the year’s end. The second pinnacle from this metric, representing “the true cycle top,” is expected to occur between September of this year and January 2025. Crypto Con further emphasizes the significance of considering the logarithmic MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) indicator, which has garnered significant attention during this cycle. The logarithmic MVRV has accurately identified cycle tops and bottoms using a converging channel. Data-wise, the cycle’s progression may be more advanced than on the surface. In March 2024, the price reached levels similar to those seen during the first tops in each cycle. Fortunately, Crypto Con notes that there is still ample room for growth towards the cycle top mark. Related Reading: Notcoin (NOT) Maintains Bullish Momentum, What Next? These observations and analyses suggest that Bitcoin demonstrates strong potential for further price appreciation. The cryptocurrency’s ability to break key resistance levels and maintain bullish momentum will determine its trajectory in the coming days and whether it can surpass previous ATHs. As of this writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market is trading at $70,800, up 4.4% in the past seven days.

28935114,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=611386,1717538403,"Dogecoin Social Sentiment Turns Bearish And Drops To March Levels, What This Means For Price","Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently revealed the bearish sentiment surrounding Dogecoin (DOGE). Interestingly, he suggested this might be a good opportunity to invest in the foremost meme coin as things could soon turn bullish. The Bearish Sentiment Around Dogecoin Martinez mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the market sentiment for Dogecoin is as bearish as it was in early February. Specifically, the crypto analyst was referring to Dogecoin’s social volume and weighted sentiment, which were currently signaling a negative sentiment towards the meme coin. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Rise 150% From Here? Crypto Expert Peter Brandt Predicts The Top This social volume metric refers to how much the crypto token is discussed across social media platforms. Therefore, the decline in Dogecoin’s social volume suggests that traders are currently paying more attention to other meme coins. This is expected given how Dogecoin’s price has lagged for a while now, with other meme coins like Dogwifhat (WIF) and Pepe (PEPE) recording significant gains. However, Martinez suggested that Dogecoin could enjoy a bullish reversal soon enough, revealing that Dogecoin’s price skyrocketed by over 200% back in February when it was plagued with such bearish sentiment. Dogecoin whales seem to have taken the hint and used this opportunity to accumulate more of the meme coin. Martinez revealed that these investors have already purchased 700 million ($112 million). The crypto analyst also mentioned that these whales have bought an additional 200 million DOGE since May 30. This is undoubtedly in anticipation of the significant price gains that Dogecoin could make soon enough. Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa also recently raised the possibility of Dogecoin rising to as high as $0.40 soon enough. He claimed that this would happen as retail investors accumulate the meme coin. He further alluded to Elon Musk’s influence on the meme coin and stated that “all it takes is one retarded Elon tweet to blow it (Dogecoin) up.” He added that Dogecoin has “great liquidity/low downside” compared to other meme coins. DOGE Season Around The Corner Crypto analyst Crypto Kaleo recently predicted that Dogecoin’s season might be around the corner. He alluded to the fact that Dogecoin rose significantly in 2021 after GameStop’s stock hit its peak in early 2021. He believes that Dogecoin could again rally once GameStop hits its market top. Related Reading: XRP Hasn’t Had A Bull Cycle Since 2017, Analyst Reveals What Will Happen When It Does In another X post, Kaleo revealed that he is confident that Dogecoin can outpace Bitcoin in this cycle. He suggested that Dogecoin’s current price action is normal, claiming that the meme coin “moves sideways for extended periods, followed by rapid vertical growth.” The crypto analyst also noted that the market is in a meme supercycle and remarked that the “king of memes won’t be left behind.” At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at around $0.15, down over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42418018,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcGEP,1717535364,The Promises and Perils of Private Asset Tokenization,"Alternative assets such as natural resources, art and private equity have become popular investments because of their potential for higher returns and lower volatility than traditional assets. However, the benefits of alternative asset classes like these also come with a number of limitations, including high minimum investment requirements, liquidity constraints and a lack of transparency.  Tokenization, the process of converting traditional assets into digital tokens through blockchain technology, may overcome some of these limitations, and its success could transform the alternatives sector.  Cristiano Ventricelli is a vice president with the digital economy team at Moody’s Ratings.  Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.  Blockchain's transparent and immutable ledger allows token holders to access real-time information about their investments, fostering greater transparency in traditionally opaque markets. This visibility is a game-changer for monitoring cash flows and performance of credit portfolios, although tokenization does not alter the underlying characteristics of the instruments. Whether on-chain or off-chain, assets’ underlying risks, and the importance of due diligence, remain the same.  One of the most promising aspects of tokenization is its potential to broaden access to high-value alternative investments. By fractionalizing ownership, tokenization lowers the barriers to entry, enabling a wider range of investors to participate in opportunities previously limited to institutional and ultra-high-net-worth investors. By making once-illiquid assets more tradable and therefore more liquid, tokenization could reshape market dynamics, creating secondary markets powered by blockchain.  Cost reduction is another significant advantage. Tokenization can streamline issuance, reducing costs for both investors and asset managers. The efficiencies gained may translate into higher returns for investors as asset managers pass on some of the potential savings. For distributors, reduced administrative burdens and overhead would allow them to focus on deepening client relationships and innovating new products. The integration of artificial intelligence in financial operations may further amplify these benefits, enhancing efficiency and accuracy.  Transparency in private markets can be improved by tokenization, but only to a certain extent. While blockchain technology enhances visibility, total transparency is unlikely. Because private market asset managers have more information about their investments than is available publicly, they can use this information asymmetry to take advantage of market opportunities and earn higher yields. This inherent characteristic of private markets will likely persist, even with the advancements brought by tokenization.  Tokenized alternative assets are already being actively traded. Traditional financial institutions have begun offering tokenized versions of private equity and private credit investments through feeder funds on private and public blockchains. These tokenized funds come with significantly lower minimum investment thresholds than their traditional counterparts, opening new avenues for a broader set of investors.  See also: Why Asset Tokenization Is Inevitable | Opinion  In decentralized finance (DeFi), platforms are using smart contracts to facilitate private credit transactions, highlighting the growing intersection between blockchain technology and alternative investments.  However, investing in tokenized private assets introduces novel risks. Regulatory and legal uncertainties remain significant barriers, with many aspects of tokenization still in a legal gray area. Investors must navigate these uncertainties, and the yields on tokenized transactions will likely be higher than those in traditional markets to compensate for the additional risks. Technical challenges also persist, particularly the need for seamless integration between on-chain and off-chain operations. The absence of a reliable digital cash option and interoperability issues among various blockchain platforms further impede the development of a robust secondary market.  Regulatory clarity, technological advancements, and industrywide cooperation are key to navigating these hurdles. If these problems are addressed, tokenization has the potential to bring accessibility, transparency and efficiency to alternative asset markets, unlocking value for a broader range of investors.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Cristiano Ventricelli,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/06/04/the-promises-and-perils-of-private-asset-tokenization,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e28579bf0afda83476377fce74cb773ba8af5e00-1500x843.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This bullish momentum propelled the token’s price from the $3,000 price range to the $3,900 mark. Related Reading: Solana-Based GameStop Tribute Token (GME) Soars 300% Following Roaring Kitty’s Return After the approval, the second-largest cryptocurrency has shown a strong performance, consolidating between the $3,700 and $3,800 levels. Some crypto analysts believe ETH is preparing for a crucial test and eye bullish targets above the $10,000 price range soon. ETH’s “Glorious Year” Depends On This Level According to crypto analyst Jelle, a community sector is currently driven by a negative sentiment towards Ethereum. The bearish sentiment, seemingly fueled by Ethereum’s failure to regain the $4,000 resistance level, has made “lots of people overcomplicate things here.” As a result, Jelle urged investors not to panic, arguing there’s no reason to “flip bearish.” The crypto analyst highlighted the key movements the King of Altcoins has seen in the past two weeks. Due to the spot ETH ETF approval, Ethereum broke out of a multi-moth falling wedge pattern. At the time, ETH successfully regained the $3,600 price range and briefly tested the $3,900 price range. After reclaiming this key support level, ETH has been consolidating above it, hovering between the $3,700 and $3,800 price range since May 28. According to the analyst, the cryptocurrency is “reclaiming the range lows of a 3-year-long reaccumulation range.” Per Jelle’s chart, ETH is regaining the lowest range of the previous bull run, which could lead to an expansion period. If the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization holds above this key level, Ethereum “will have a glorious year.” Additionally, the analyst considers that ETH’s last hurdle to overcome this cycle is the $4,000 resistance level. Once “it breaks $4,000, it’s clear skies ahead” to potentially reach the price target of $10,000. Similarly, known crypto analyst Il Capo of Crypto noted that his main scenario is a bullish continuation. Per Il Capo, Ethereum is “looking good” above the $3,650 range. This performance seemingly sets the cryptocurrency for a “bullish continuation” towards the previous cycle’s all-time high (ATH). Ethereum ETFs, The Catalyst For New ATH? Despite the doubts, Ethereum’s recent performance resembles Bitcoin’s (BTC) in previous cycles. According to crypto trader Ash, ETH is following the path of the flagship cryptocurrency in 2018-2021. If it continues this track, “$10,000+ ETH is programmed.” As the crypto market awaits the listing of the spot ETF, some analysts consider it the catalyst for an “explosive” alt season this year. Similarly, Ali Martinez noted that over 777,000 ETH, worth around $3 billion, have been withdrawn from exchanges since the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the investment products. Due to a supply squeeze, this development could propel ETH’s price to higher levels. However, Lookonchain recently revealed that two participants of Ethereum’s Initial Coin Offering (ICO) deposited around 4.5% of their holdings on a crypto exchange. Per the post, the ICO participants received 200,000 ETH, worth around $767 million, at Ethereum’s Genesis.

Core Scientific is the latest Bitcoin miner to get a buyout offer from a suitor, this one coming from the company's HPC hosting customer. Bitcoin mining fundamentals are questionable going forward and there are still over $1 billion in total liabilities. It has been nearly two years since I last covered Core Scientific, Inc. ( CORZ ) for Seeking Alpha. In the time since that ""sell"" call, CORZ shareholders have been on quite the journey, to say the least. Data by YCharts Shortly following my late-October 2022 CORZ article, the crypto market experienced the collapse of FTX which further depressed prices of crypto coins and proxies like Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ) mining stocks. For Core Scientific specifically, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and re-emerged with a reorganization plan highlighting reduced debt and 60% equity retention for shareholders of the delisted stock. It admittedly could have gone far worse for CORZ holders and the relisted equity has performed quite well this year. Data by YCharts More recently, shares have CORZ have rocketed higher largely in response to the company's efforts in the AI datacenter space and a buyout offer from its primary HPC services client. In this update, we'll look at the CoreWeave news, financials as of Q1-24, and the company's mining business. Core Scientific and CoreWeave On June 4th, Bloomberg reported an offer from CoreWeave to buyout Core Scientific at a roughly $1 billion valuation, or $5.75 per share. This came just one day after Core Scientific announced contracts for a large expansion of the company's HPC services agreement with CoreWeave . CORZ shares have rallied nearly 50% on this news as of article submission and are actually trading at almost about a 20% premium to CoreWeave's offer price. Per the company's June 3rd press release, the newly announced HPC contracts are for 200 MW of HPC infrastructure and will last 12 years with the potential to expand further. According to Core Scientific, these agreements will result in approximately $290 million of recurring, dollar-denominated revenue annually. This is an expansion of a pre-existing relationship between Core Scientific and CoreWeave. Between 2019 and 2022, CoreWeave was utilizing Core Scientific for GPU hosting. More recently, Core Scientific deployed 16 MW of capacity at its Austin, Texas data center for CoreWeave earlier this year. It's important to point out that GPUs and ASICs aren't interchangeable. To scale HPC service revenue, Core Scientific has to modify some of its existing infrastructure to better align its mining and HPC segments. Core Scientific is estimating that $300 million of the capital investment required for infrastructure modifications will be funded by CoreWeave. Site modifications are expected to begin in the second half of this year with operations beginning in the first half of 2025. Q1-24 Earnings & Balance Sheet The news of both a possible buyout from and business expansion plans with CoreWeave follows what has been a fairly impressive turnaround for Core Scientific in recent quarters. At the end of March 2024, the company reported over $173 million in revenue against $101.6 million in costs of revenue and $17 million in total opex: Data by YCharts Factoring in over $111 million in net reorganization items that include extinguishment of loans, leases, and notes, net income in the quarter came in just under $211 million: Data by YCharts This was the company's first positive quarter for net income since December 2021. Breaking out the revenue by segment shows Core Scientific is still largely dependent on digital asset mining as it accounts for nearly 84% of the company's total revenue with hosting making up the rest: 10-Q (Core Scientific) In Q1-23, Core Scientific had about a 14% gross margin on hosting revenue from customers. That figure more than doubled to over 31% in Q1-24. On the surface, we see similar gains in gross margin from the mining segment with 26% gross margins last year improving to roughly 45% in the last quarter. We'll explore the mining segment a bit more in the next section. Data by YCharts Briefly shifting to the balance sheet, Core has about $98 million in cash with $814 million in total assets against more than $1.1 billion in total liabilities. May Investor Deck, Slide 21 (Core Scientific) The good thing is most of the company's debt isn't due for several years with more than a half billion dollars in principal weighted to 2027 or after. Given the company's apparent HPC revenue from CoreWeave ramping up in 2025, Core Scientific's financials aren't actually as bad as I previously suspected. However, Core Scientific's future is seemingly at the mercy of CoreWeave; which from where I sit explains why CoreWeave's buyout offer has come in shortly following the expanded HPC services relationship. There is presumably far more upside for CoreWeave if it simply owns the infrastructure rather than renting it from Core Scientific. Bitcoin Mining Business Frankly, the HPC services agreement with CoreWeave probably couldn't be coming at a better time given the recent halving of the Bitcoin block reward subsidy. We don't yet have May production data from the company, but the trend over the last several quarters is pretty clear. As global Bitcoin hash rate grows, the share of the block reward declines if miners can't continue to scale owned production capacity in line with global hash: BTC Production (Author's Chart, Core Scientific Filings) Since January 2023, Core Scientific's monthly BTC production has been in decline even as self-mined EH/s has continued to grow. BTC per EH/s April (Author's Chart, Company Filings) In April, Core Scientific's Bitcoin produced per EH/s was in the middle of the pack compared to most of the top public Bitcoin mining companies. If we adjust the April data down by 50% to provide an estimate for May and assume revenue from transaction fees continues to be sporadic, we get 19.7 BTC per EH/s going forward. Using Core Scientific's April mining capacity, we can estimate 402 BTC in May. Short of higher BTC prices in perpetuity or meaningful growth in transaction fees, Core Scientific's Bitcoin mining business is likely to deteriorate in the months and quarters ahead. All this said, the company's mining segment may indeed benefit from higher BTC prices later this year and next year. Closing Summary If we take my May BTC production estimate of 402 for Core Scientific and build an annualized revenue table based on Bitcoin's price, it takes a six-figure BTC price to get close to $500 million in full-year revenue from mining: BTC Price Revenue per month Annualized $70,000 $28,140,000 $337,680,000 $80,000 $32,160,000 $385,920,000 $90,000 $36,180,000 $434,160,000 $100,000 $40,200,000 $482,400,000 Source: Author's calculations, assumes 402 BTC mined per month Making the assumption that BTC's price will hit $100k by 2025 and assuming $290 million in HPC service revenue from CoreWeave in the year as well, Core Scientific's stock trades at about 1.5 times sales at $7 per share. This would be roughly a 47% discount to the info tech sector median. Given that, I'm actually not all that surprised to see the stock trading at a premium to CoreWeave's buyout offer. I'll close by saying I don't have a dog in this fight. I've never shorted CORZ despite calling it a ""sell"" two years ago. Despite the buyout offer, I do think there is still risk in this name. I'm personally of the view that ""AI"" as an investment idea has skewed more to hype than real substance. Given that, this rally may be an incredible opportunity for shareholders from the previous cycle to get out alive from what was a bankruptcy story not too long ago.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4697417-core-scientific-hpc-deals-and-a-buyout-offer?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/28930059.jpeg

28928841,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=611389,1717527608,Crypto Pundit Shares “Inevitable” Prices For Bitcoin And 5 Altcoins,"With the crypto market expected to enter a bull run later this year, and Bitcoin, alongside altcoins, are already expected to be responding to it. As crypto investors eagerly await this bull run, a crypto analyst has revealed where they expect the prices of six cryptocurrencies to reach. Bitcoin And Altcoins Set To Move As Bitcoin and altcoins begin their move up, Crypto Emily, an analyst, has revealed where she expects the price of major cryptocurrencies to go. The analyst starts out with Bitcoin, giving it a major price tag before moving on to other altcoins. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Rise 150% From Here? Crypto Expert Peter Brandt Predicts The Top For Bitcoin, Crypto Emily believes that the price of the foremost cryptocurrency will rise to $100,000, joining the ranks of Bitcoin believers who think this is possible. From the current price, it is a less than 50% price move for the leading crypto, suggesting that it is possible. Then moving further, the crypto analyst turns her attention to altcoins. The first of the altcoins is Ethereum, which is the second-largest cryptocurrency in the market. Despite Ethereum failing to break $4,000, the crypto analyst expects that the altcoin will see its price eventually touch $10,000 as it’s inevitable. This bullishness carries on to other larger altcoins besides Bitcoin and Ethereum. For example, Crypto Emily makes similar forecasts for both the Solana price and the BNB price. She expected Solana to rise another 600% to reach $1,000 from here, and then for BNB to climb almost 50% to reach the same $1,000. Moving on, the next altcoins to make the list are XRP and Polygon’s MATIC. Both of these digital assets, the crypto analyst believes will eventually reach $10, a similarly price increase for both of them. However, what is even more interesting is how both of these altcoins have performed over the last year. $100k is inevitable for #Bitcoin $10k is inevitable for #ETH $1000 is inevitable for #SOL & #BNB $10 is inevitable for $XRP & $MATIC What are your targets❓ — Emily’s Universe 💎 (@Crypto__emily) June 2, 2024 While the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen major upside this year, both XRP and MATIC have failed to make any meaningful moves. The XRP price is still over 83% down from its $3.84 all-time high and MATIC is 75% down from its $2.92 all-time high. Together, the constitute some of the worst performances seen among large altcoins over the last year. Related Reading: Chainlink Is Not Done: Analyst Predicts 300% Rise Against Bitcoin Nevertheless, for now, the crypto bull run looks to be far off as Bitcoin and altcoins continue to struggle in the market. Given the crypto market’s dependency on Bitcoin to begin the next bull run, a break toward $80,000 would likely kickstart the next bull run. In this case, altcoins are expected to run alongside it, making new all-time highs as well.

42418027,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcGMf,1717526733,"Ether Price Poised for Supply 'Shock' as ETFs May Attract $4B Inflows in Five Months, K33 Research Says","U.S. spot ETFs could accumulate around 1 million ETH in five months based on the size of similar ETH products globally and CME futures open interest relative to bitcoin, K33 Research said  The omission of staking will not negatively impact the inflows to the ETFs, the report said.  Ethereum-based exchange-traded funds (ETF) that can directly hold ether {{ETH}} are soon arriving in the U.S. and could attract $4 billion of inflows in the first five months, crypto analytics firm K33 Research said in a report.  The company based its forecast by comparing the assets under management in existing ETH-based exchange-traded products around the globe to similar bitcoin {{BTC}} products and the amount of open interest (OI) in futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the go-to marketplace for institutional investors.  Ether's OI on CME currently stands at 23% of the size of BTC futures, but it has seen an average share of 35% of BTC futures since ETH futures started trading on CME in 2021, indicating significant institutional demand for ETH in the U.S., per K33.  Applying these ratios to the nearly $14 billion inflows so far into the spot BTC ETFs, K33 puts the estimated ETH ETF inflows between $3 billion and $4.8 billion within the first five months. This estimate is slightly higher than JPMorgan's $3 billion forecast for this year.  Read more: Ether Spot ETFs to See Much Lower Demand Than Bitcoin Versions, JPMorgan Says  Based on current prices, this would equal 800,000 to 1.26 million of ETH accumulated in the ETFs, or roughly 0.7%-1.05% of the total supply of tokens, creating a supply crunch for the asset, according to the report. Unlike futures-based products, the issuers of spot ETFs will need to buy tokens in the spot market as investors buy ETF shares.  ""As seen in BTC, this monumental supply absorption shock should lead to price appreciation in ETH,"" said Vetle Lunde, senior analyst at K33 Research.  Bitcoin, after an initial correction in late January, rallied nearly 60% to record highs following the introduction of U.S. spot ETFs. K33 analysts predicted that with the start of ether ETFs, the price of ETH would start outperforming BTC after almost two and a half years of the ETH-BTC pair's downtrend.  Last month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved key filings for spot ETH ETFs in a move that surprised most market participants. This move paved the way for greenlighting the funds to trade in the U.S. After working through the necessary documentation, market observers expect the ETFs to start trading as soon as late June or early July, the K33 report said.  Notably, applicants deleted the parts of their filings that would have allowed staking the assets in the fund, likely to appease the regulator.  K33 said that the omission of staking would not negatively impact inflows to the ETFs, contradicting JPMorgan's stance, as 99% of assets under management in Canadian ETH ETFs and 98% of European products are held in funds without staking.

BODEN appeared to be the winner, up 10% versus 5% for TREMP.  Kraken announced today that it has listed the PoliFi tokens BODEN and TREMP on its Kraken Pro platform, making it the first major exchange available to U.S. residents that has listed PoliFi tokens.  For the uninitiated, PoliFi tokens are meme coins with a political theme, seen as a way to express support for a preferred candidate. While the first major PoliFi token was MAGA, BODEN and TREMP, two tokens on Solana with caricatures of the politicians inspired by Doland, a bastardized version of Donald Duck with an attitude problem, are quickly catching up in popularity.  And with U.S residents now able to trade two major PoliFi tokens on a major retail exchange – previously they were only available on offshore centralized exchanges or decentralized exchanges – BODEN appears to be the winner.  According to CoinGecko data, the Joe Biden-themed token was up over 13% immediately after the listing announcement before leveling off. In the last 24 hours, it's ahead 10% versus 5% for TREMP.  Currently BODEN has a trading volume of around $10 million versus TREMP's $12 million, per CoinGecko, which has yet to list trading volume from Kraken.  The trading volume for these tokens is fairly small in the crypto world. Dogwifhat, for instance, has volume within the $400 million range over the similar period.  On Predictit, which is open to U.S. residents, Trump leads Biden by over four percentage points, a margin higher than poll aggregates compiled by 270 to Win, which puts Trump less than a percentage point ahead.

28925618,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=611426,1717522236,"Bitcoin Ready To Takeoff? Analyst Eyes $85,000 as Fundamentals Align","Bitcoin prices are hovering near $70,000, bouncing from a critical dynamic support line, evident in the daily chart. Even though bulls have yet to breach $72,000 and break above March 2024 highs, traders are optimistic about what lies ahead. Bitcoin Bulls In Charge: Analyst Targets $85,000 Taking to X, one analyst believes the world’s most valuable coin is preparing for a decisive breakout above the local resistance levels and all-time highs at around $74,000. In a post, the analyst notes that Bitcoin has been consolidating, moving sideways and even lower for the past three months since mid-March. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Massive Solana Price Crash Using Elliott Waves If buyers succeed, the near 100-day consolidation could set the base for prices to spike, ushering a “next leg higher” that would likely take BTC to $85,000. Still, even amid the optimism, traders should be cautious. Technically, the upside momentum has been fizzling. Even with gains on June 3, buyers’ failure to confirm the gains of May 20 is slowing down the uptrend. So far, the $72,000 level on the upper hand must be conquered for any hopes of further gains. On the lower end, support lies at $66,000. Even so, the dynamic 20-day moving average is emerging as a worthy support. Any breakout in either direction, most preferably in alignment with Q1 2024 gains, would be fundamentally driven. Inflation, Spot BTC ETF Inflows Fanning Demand Looking at fundamental data streaming from the United States, the stage is being set for optimistic buyers. Cooling inflation and the uptick in M2 money supply could hint that buyers are getting ready. The United States Federal Reserve has closely monitored inflation, among other metrics. With inflation dropping, the Fed may decide to slash interest rates, fueling a bull run like it did in 2021. Related Reading: Bitcoin Gets Massive $500,000 Price Tag From Billionaire, Here’s Why Other key drivers would include the encouraging flow into spot Bitcoin ETFs. As BTC soared to register March 2024 highs, inflow spiked, driven chiefly by institutional demand. After prices broke higher on May 20, inflows have picked up momentum. On June 3, Lookonchain data revealed that spot BTC ETF issuers in the United States added 2,413 BTC. Grayscale’s GBTC reduced just 12 BTC. Launching the Monochrome Bitcoin ETF (IBTC) in Australia and a similar product in Hong Kong and globally will only increase the demand for BTC. The newly launched IBTC spot ETF in Australia will directly hold BTC, which will be under the custody of Coinbase.

42418041,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcIe5,1717519243,"You May Not Like It, but Casey Rodarmor Proves Bitcoin Is Permissionless","Casey Rodarmor says he has no regrets about the two controversial protocols, Ordinals and Runes, he launched on Bitcoin, which have made the original and most valuable blockchain a lot more like other, alternative chains.  There are essentially two guiding principles that Rodarmor has followed since bursting on the scene as one of Bitcoin’s most influential coders: Bitcoin should remain secure and so should its applications.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.  The “only thing that's interesting about any sort of blockchain is the extent to which it can resist the government,” Rodarmor said on stage at Consensus 2024, in Austin, Texas, on Friday. “I view bitcoin’s {{BTC}} primary role as being hard money that individuals can adopt to transact and do all the things that they want to do with [it].”  Although Ordinals and Runes have generated about as much antipathy as enthusiasm among bitcoiners, Rodarmor’s protocols are proof positive that it’s possible to build things using Bitcoin that are as difficult to stop as a bitcoin transaction is to censor. In so doing, he has kicked off a new era – sometimes called Bitcoin Season Two – celebrating the fact that Bitcoin can be used almost however you want.  That said, Rodarmor readily acknowledged that Runes, his latest project, launched to coincide with the Bitcoin halving event on April 19, 2024, is decidedly less important than Bitcoin itself. He referred to the protocol, which enables the creation of tradable assets on Bitcoin similar to tokens on Ethereum, as a “sideshow.”  See also: Casey Rodarmor: The Bitcoin Artist | Most Influential 2023  “They are not as important as Bitcoin in this vein,” he said. “They provide the sort of niche, fun, degenerate thing” that crypto traders seem to desire. And that’s where the value of Runes and Ordinals comes from: by creating an outlet for on-chain gambling, they also help to bolster Bitcoin’s once-lagging fee economy.  In fact, the historic halving event earned the highest fees ever paid for a bitcoin block, at just over $2.4 million in BTC. Transaction fees remained elevated through much of April, but have since normalized to around $3 on average, according to bitinfocharts. But that is higher than the sub-dollar prices seen through much of 2022 and 2023.  “I for sure would not have done anything that I thought was bad for Bitcoin,” Rodamor said, explaining that due to the hard cap on the amount of bitcoins that will eventually enter into circulation via a mining subsidy, the network’s security will ultimately have to be paid for by transaction fees. “I would prefer those sources are here sooner rather than later.”  Rodarmor added that his work is really part of a continuum of people building all types of tools, from chain swaps to different ways to configure transactions, that have the possibility of attracting “normal users.” However, these tools are only ultimately useful to Bitcoin if they “contribute to the security and robustness” of the network.  “I think this gives people a preview of the destiny of Bitcoin,” he said. “They can see what it's like with very high fees.”  See also: Why Christie's First Bitcoin Inscriptions Auction Matters | The Node  All of this is important especially in light of Bitcoin’s “anarchic” governance structure – which, similar to Churchill's famous quote about democracy, is “dysfunctional” but likely the “absolute best form of governance that Bitcoin could have,” Rodarmor said. Because no one individual or entity is directly responsible for Bitcoin, the only shot of developing a sustainable fee economy is by shipping actual products.  What “makes people uncomfortable about Bitcoin governance is that there is no formal governance,” Rodarmor said.

Bitcoin Price May Not Be Overvalued Yet Based On Thermo Cap Ratio In a new post on X, CryptoQuant CEO and founder Ki Young Ju has discussed about how the recent trend in the Bitcoin Thermo Cap Ratio has been like. The “Thermo Cap” is a capitalization model for BTC that calculates the total value of the asset by taking each token’s value as the same as the spot price when it was mined on the network. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Will Rise To $79,600 If This Holds Put another way, this model calculates the cumulative value of the coins mined by the miners since the inception of the blockchain. This is quite different from what, for example, the usual market cap does. In the market cap’s case, the current spot price is taken as the value of all coins in circulation. As the coins that miners mine are the only way to increase the cryptocurrency’s supply, the Thermo Cap may be considered a measure of the “true” capital inflows coming into the network. Here is a chart that displays how the Bitcoin Thermo Cap has changed over its history: As the above graph shows, the Thermo Cap has seen an accelerating growth curve. This naturally reflects the increasing amount of capital flowing into the asset over the years. In the context of the current topic, though, the indicator of interest isn’t the Thermo Cap itself but rather the Thermo Cap Ratio. This metric tracks the ratio between the Bitcoin market cap and the Thermo Cap. The chart below shows the trend in the Thermo Cap Ratio over the asset’s history. An interesting pattern is visible in the graph. It appears that very high values of the Thermo Cap Ratio have coincided with highs in the cryptocurrency’s price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Has Solid On-Chain Cushion Below $68,900: Stage Set For Fresh Rally? At high values, the Bitcoin market cap is quite large compared to the Thermo Cap, meaning that coins are trading at a much higher rate than they were mined at. It’s also apparent that bottoms in BTC occur when the ratio assumes low values. The recent trend in the indicator has been that of a rise, but its value has not touched the levels where bull run tops would have happened in the past. “Bitcoin is not currently overvalued based on network fundamentals,” notes the CryptoQuant founder. BTC Price Bitcoin has been unable to break out of its range recently as its price has kept up the trend of sideways movement. At present, BTC is trading at around $68,900.

42418040,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcIf7,1717515645,"India Springs Election Surprise, Sends Equity Market Crashing With Uncertain Implications for Crypto","India's election results are underwhelming for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling party.  If Modi is able to persuade his allies to stay, the government will continue, albeit with less power.  Crypto was at best a negligible issue for voters and certainly not a political talking point during campaigning in the world's largest democracy.  India's voters sprung an election surprise on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party, awarding it a smaller share than forecast in preliminary results, sending stock markets crashing and likely pushing crypto legislation further into the future.  While Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies are poised to return to power, they didn’t hit the supermajority mark of 370 plus seats in India’s 543-seat lower house of parliament, which they predicted. In fact, the BJP alone did not hit the halfway mark of 272, which it had comfortably crossed in the 2019 election. The result hands kingmaking power to his allies, and the opposition led by the Indian National Congress could attempt to lure them away.  On June 1, exit polls had predicted a comfortable victory for the BJP and its allies, resulting in record highs for the country's stock markets. As results trickled in on Tuesday, stocks lost more than $350 billion in value in a matter of hours. The Nifty and the Sensex sank as much as 8.5% at one stage, before recouping some of the declines.  ""The election results were a true black swan event that no one saw coming,"" said Rajagopal Menon, vice president of Indian cryptocurrency exchange WazirX. ""In the short term, markets will remain jittery as they despise instability. Once the new government takes office, things should return to normal.""  Crypto was at best a negligible issue for voters and certainly not a political talking point during campaigning in the world's largest democracy. The results, whatever they would have been, were not expected to immediately affect crypto policy in the nation, and its current restrictive rules were expected to stay in place. India has implemented a tax of 1% deducted at source on every crypto transaction, the primary concern for the industry.  Modi's government had also prioritized framing crypto policy with global consensus during its presidency of the Group of 20 nations last year.  Now, any plans for comprehensive crypto legislation, the industry's next biggest hope, are likely to be kicked further down the road, given the need to solidify a governing coalition and accommodate partners' policy concerns as a priority. It's possible India could see a change in one of the most important positions that influence crypto policy – the role of Finance Minister, currently held by Modi's colleague Nirmala Sitharaman.  ""On the crypto regulation front, nothing changes significantly,"" Menon said. ""India is a signatory to the G20 ministerial declaration, which outlines a clear roadmap for regulations by 2025. Things will start heating up towards the end of the year for crypto regulations.""  In December 2023, a senior BJP lawmaker told CoinDesk he didn't expect comprehensive legislation for the sector till mid-2025.

It is the largest meme coin on the Bitcoin blockchain and the seventh largest overall.  The rally comes after a 60% decline following its launch and the bitcoin halving in April.  A meme coin issued on Bitcoin's Runes protocol is nearing a $1 billion market cap after surging 200% over the past 30 days.  The aptly named DOG•GO•TO•THE•MOON (DOG) token spawned on April 20 during the bitcoin halving event. It became ""Rune Number 3"" and has since become the largest meme coin on Bitcoin and the seventh-largest meme coin across the crypto market. The largest, dogecoin {{DOGE}}, has a market cap of $23 billion.  DOG's rise comes on the back of a flurry of meme-coin activity with the likes of SHIB, PEPE and FLOKI all adding billions of dollars to their market caps since the start of the year.  While most other meme coins are issued on super-fast blockchains like Solana and Base, DOG is helping establish Runes as a legitimate Bitcoin layer-2 network despite the cumbersome nature of the Bitcoin blockchain.  Runes is essentially a way of making transactions cheaper and faster than the Ordinals Protocol, which embeds data into the Bitcoin blockchain by inscribing information into small Bitcoin-based transactions.  DOG has racked up close to $100 million in trading volume over the past 24 hours as traders begin betting on whether a Bitcoin-based meme coin could emulate the success of established equivalents on other chains.  It's worth noting that meme coins are highly volatile assets as they ebb and flow based on social media narrative and not on an underlying use case.

Multicoin Capital was the lead investor, with crypto exchange Coinbase's venture capital arm Coinbase Ventures, UC Berkeley Skydeck and Awesome People Ventures also participating in the round.  Stablecoins are a $160 billion asset class within crypto, with their prices anchored to an external asset, predominantly to the U.S. dollar. They are increasingly popular in developing regions such as Latin America with less developed banking systems and history of currency devaluations.  Dollar-pegged stablecoins are also a cheaper option than traditional banking and remittance rails to send money abroad.  Read more: Tether and Circle Stablecoin Purchases Dominate in Argentina  ""The Latin American economy is reeling due to decades of inflation,"" Guillermo Goncalvez, co-founder and CEO of El Dorado, said in a statement. ""Making matters worse, local cross-border exchanges charge excessive fees – an astonishing 6% for a normal, run-of-the-mill currency swap. The combination of these two forces makes it almost impossible for the people of Latin America to retain or grow their wealth,” he added.  El Dorado, which is available in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Panama, Peru and Venezuela, provides a cheaper way to send, exchange and pay using blockchain as payment rail. The platform charges 0.6% fee for cross-border payments, significantly less than the industry average, while in-app payments are free.  The app is connected to more than 70 local payment methods to facilitate on-ramp and off-ramp to fiat currencies. It supports Tether's USDT, Circle's USDC and Celo Dollar (cUSD) stablecoins on the Tron, Polygon and Celo networks, while also allows bitcoin {{BTC}} transactions.

This ambitious forecast hinges on the potential for a bull run following Bitcoin’s fourth halving cycle, which occurred on April 20 2024. Bitcoin To Surge To $500,000 Palihapitiya has entered a notable discussion regarding the impact of historical halving cycles on Bitcoin’s value. The billionaire investor shared a price analysis illustrating Bitcoin’s performance and trend patterns following each halving event. Related Reading: XRP Hasn’t Had A Bull Cycle Since 2017, Analyst Reveals What Will Happen When It Does According to Palihapitiya, historically, Bitcoin has reached new all-time highs after each halving cycle. He highlighted a correlation between Bitcoin’s halving events from 2012 to 2024, detailing the cryptocurrency’s price actions one month, three months, six months, nine months, 12 months and 18 months post-halving. Palihapitiya noted that during the first three months after a Bitcoin halving event, investors are usually still reassessing the event and its impact on the crypto market. However, he revealed that from 6 to 18 months post-halving, Bitcoin witnessed an exponential price appreciation, pushing it to new all-time highs. “Bitcoin price has increased materially following each halving, with the bulk of the returns realized between 12 months and 18 months after the halving event,” Palihapitiya wrote. He disclosed that 18 months after Bitcoin’s first halving cycle, the cryptocurrency’s price increased by 45X. Following the second halving cycle, Bitcoin rose almost 28X, and after the third halving, it surged nearly 8X. Based on these halving patterns, Palihapitiya has projected Bitcoin’s future value to reach $500,000 by October 2025, expecting it to follow a similar trend as its previous halving cycles. BTC Could Replace Gold In his discussion, Palihapitiya disclosed that by analyzing the average patterns of Bitcoin’s previous halving cycles, the cryptocurrency could potentially surge to a peak of $1.4 million. He declared that Bitcoin could completely replace gold if it reaches such levels of appreciation, emphasizing its potential to become a digital currency with transactional utility for hard assets. Based on the averages of the second and third halving cycles, the billionaire investor projects Bitcoin’s price to rise to $99,643 six months after its halving event in April, reaching $238,623 in nine months, $362,997 in 12 months and nearly $500,000 in 18 months. Palihapitiya also disclosed several factors that could contribute to Bitcoin’s rise to $500,000. He stated that the increasing demand for Spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) could have a significant impact on the value of Bitcoin in 2024. Related Reading: Chainlink Is Not Done: Analyst Predicts 300% Rise Against Bitcoin This prediction may hold weight considering Bitcoin saw a consistent price increase at the beginning of the year after the approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

CoreWeave said to have made the offer on Monday, implying a 55% premium to the miners' three-month average weighted share price as of May 31, Bloomberg reported citing a person familiar with the matter.  The offer would value the Austin, Texas-based miner at just over $1 billion, based on 178 million shares outstanding. Core Scientific emerged from bankruptcy earlier this year after it became one of the victims of a brutal crypto winter.  CoreWeave and Core Scientific didn't immediately respond to comments on the story.  The cloud computing company also signed a 12-year deal with the miner to host AI-related services. CoreWeave said it will provide about $300 million of capital investments, with options to expand the capacity further, according to a press release.  The deal comes after mergers and acquisitions are heating up in the mining sector. Most recently, another large bitcoin miner, Riot Platforms (RIOT), made a hostile offer to buy out peer Bitfarms (BITF).  CoreWeave raised $1.1 billion in new funding in May with investors, including Coatue Management and Magnetar Capital.

The SEC's recent amendment of rules for listing Ethereum ETFs has significantly increased the likelihood of the ETFs securing approvals and trading on US exchanges. The demand for Ethereum and the ETHE fund is expected to increase in a diminished supply environment, potentially leading to a rally and a retest of all-time highs. The exclusion of staked Ethereum from the ETFs creates some level of uncertainty, but the optimism will outweigh the uncertainty for now. Investment Thesis While Bitcoin ( BTC- USD) has been a big beneficiary in the wake of the SEC's approvals on bitcoin etfs, its altcoin peer, Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), has been trailing in relative performance so far this year, as seen in the chart below. Exhibit A: Relative performance of Ethereum vs Bitcoin since 2017, weekly (TradingView) In Exhibit A above, I see how Ethereum surged in early March only for investors to be suddenly pessimistic after the SEC pushed back on the Ethereum-based ETF applications by a few asset management firms. That led to the likelihood of the firms securing approvals for their ETFs getting slashed to just 30% . The odds drastically changed a couple of weeks ago when the SEC suddenly amended rules to permit the listing of Ethereum ETFs on U.S. exchanges . This takes all Ethereum applications one step closer to securing approvals to finally begin trading on U.S. exchanges and for Grayscale's Ethereum Trust Fund ( ETHE ) to convert to a fully-functional ETF. This move by the SEC has created the perfect conditions for a rally to continue in Ethereum and the ETHE fund, which could see Ethereum retest its all-time highs struck in 2021. I recommend buying ETHE. About Grayscale's Ethereum Trust Fund The Ethereum Trust Fund, whose assets are managed by Grayscale, the largest crypto asset management firm in the world, The ETHE fund aims to offer investors exposure to Ethereum by investing the fund's assets directly into it. At the time of writing this research note, ETHE is still the only fund currently available to investors that offers investors exposure to Ethereum while avoiding the housekeeping needs of buying and holding Ethereum directly. Grayscale achieves its purpose of offering investors exposure to Ethereum by tracking CoinDesk's Ether Price Index . The fund's shares still operate as an over-the-counter instrument, and Grayscale, via NYSE Arca, filed its 19b-4 form last year to convert its trust fund into an ETF instrument. In ETHE's case, Coinbase provides the necessary custodial services, holding Ethereum on behalf of the ETHE fund that is used to back the fund's assets. As noted in the previous section, the SEC has recently approved Grayscale's 19b-4 forms as well as the 19b-4 forms of at least seven other Ethereum ETFs by Grayscale's peers, including BlackRock, Fidelity, VanEck, etc. ETHE's current peer ETF ecosystem commentary I had mentioned earlier how most asset management firms that have filed for their respective Ethereum ETF applications have gotten one step closer after the SEC approved the 19b-4 forms. This leaves the final stage remaining, where each fund's S-1 must be approved for the respective Ethereum to start trading on exchanges. The same can be assumed for Grayscale's ETHE, which will start trading as an ETF instrument after final approval. I believe this is just a formality, and the final approval could be done by the SEC as early as this month, per some projections. This is also reflected in the ETHE fund's premium/discount metric, which still points to the fund trading at a 1.4% discount to the fund's (NAV) Net Asset Value as seen in Exhibit B. As we get closer to approval, I expect demand for the ETHE to increase, with the fund eventually trading either at par or at a premium to its NAV. Exhibit B: Grayscale Ethereum Trust Fund trades at a 1.4% discount to the fund's Net Asset Value (YCharts) Post approval, I expect some outflows from the ETHE fund by investors who have been securing positions in ETHE as part of their arbitrage play in anticipation of the final approvals of ETHE and its peer ETFs. Per the fund's current prospectus , ETHE has a fund management fee of 2.5%. I anticipate all of ETHE's peers will list their respective expense ratios far lower than the current ETHE's fund management fee to attract capital, just as I pointed out in my coverage of the iShare Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ). Grayscale is quite aware of this and anticipates elevated levels of outflows, but it plans to address that by launching Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust and has already filed the S-1 for that. The seed capital for the mini ETH ETF will be allocated from the ETHE, per the prospectus, thus giving existing ETHE investors access to the mini ETH ETF in addition to the shares held in the ETHE fund. Assessing demand for underlying Ethereum I had mentioned earlier in Exhibit A how Ethereum had been relatively underperforming Bitcoin this year. But there are a couple of dynamic changes in the market that I believe point to favorable conditions for Ethereum and the ETHE fund. First is the outflow of digital assets, such as Ethereum, out of exchanges and usually into digital wallets. I observe this by borrowing a chart from CryptoQuant that illustrates the flow of Ethereum out of exchanges, as shown in Exhibit C. Exhibit C: Outflow of Ethereum from Exchanges (CryptoQuant) I believe the trends illustrated in Exhibit C imply favorable trends in Ethereum to follow as investors move more Ethereum from exchange to their digital wallets. This is usually a sign that crypto investors holding Ethereum would prefer holding on to their Ethereum in their digital wallets rather than having it ready to trade on the exchanges. This deduction is also corroborated by the chart borrowed from Glassnode , as seen in Exhibit D below, which shows the number of wallet addresses holding at least $1 million in Ethereum. $1M in Ethereum"" width=""640"" height=""360"" contenteditable=""false"" data-width=""640"" data-height=""360""> Exhibit D: Number of Wallet addresses holding >$1M in Ethereum (Glassnode) My takeaways from both the charts combined in Exhibits C & D point to crypto markets with reduced Ethereum supply. As more investors get bullish again about Ethereum, they move their assets to digital wallets, thus reducing the supply of Ethereum. The diminished supply of Ethereum creates supply/demand imbalances, which should create upward price pressures-factors that imply bullishness for Ethereum and ETHE as a result. Based on the sentiment that I see, Ethereum could easily continue on its current trajectory closer towards retesting its ATHs (all-time highs). Staked Ethereum to be excluded from ETFs There are many differences between Ethereum and Bitcoin that investors should be aware of, but for the purpose of this note, staking is something that will be key in impacting Ethereum ETFs over the long term. First, a quick primer on Ethereum and how it works. Ethereum is the largest digital currency by market cap, and is an alternative to Bitcoin. Bitcoin's design characteristics resemble those of fiat currencies; hence, it trades more as a medium of exchange and store of value. On the other hand, Ethereum's modular design philosophy positions the altcoin closer to relative usability in terms of user applications. Smart contracts and Staking are some of those features, and the Ethereum blockchain network became more serious about staking after it switched its reward mechanism to Proof-of-Stake in 2022 . Simply put, staking is quite similar to term deposits, where Ethereum holders ""stake"" some of their holdings and lock them up while earning rewards through the lock-up period. The chart in Exhibit E highlights the staking APY yield versus the percent of supply staked. Exhibit E: Ethereum staking rewards in terms of APY over the past 18 months (Compass, Blockworks Research) The chart shows that as of last month, ~27% of Ethereum's supply was staked, almost doubling from a year ago. At the same time, Ethereum pays any crypto investor a blended APY of ~3.4% to stake their Ethereum holdings. With 27% of the supply staked, this has a meaningful impact on the supply of Ethereum. Especially after ETF applications were updated by most asset management firms to exclude any staked supply of Ethereum from their holdings, The SEC regards staking as a security and has set enough precedents to act on its opinion in the past . As of now, to me, this indicates investors holding Ethereum would hold a performance edge over investors who allocated their capital towards Ethereum ETFs such as ETHE. But a lot can change between now and the eventual S-1 approvals for Ethereum ETFs. Therefore, this would be one potential area to watch for long-term impact. Takeaway Regardless of the long-term impacts that I alluded to earlier, I believe there is enough hype that has been generated by the recent SEC approvals that indicate investors are closer than ever to start investing and trading in Ethereum ETFs without the need to manage digital wallet infrastructure. Long-term implications are currently uncertain for Ethereum ETFs with respect to the exclusion of staked Ethereum holdings, but on a short-term basis, I believe the sentiment is strong enough for ETHE to move higher and possibly even retest its all-time highs. For now, I recommend a Buy on ETHE.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4697325-ethe-etf-euphoria-to-drive-eth-closer-to-aths-amid-staking-concerns?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/28916185.jpeg

Polygon has gone all in on zero-knowledge cryptography over the last few years, betting that the tech will be key to scaling Ethereum's blockchain ecosystem over the long term. Polygon Labs has a history of acquiring outside ZK shops to help staff its internal zero-knowledge initiatives, and the purchase of Toposware brings a third major zero-knowledge team into the Polygon orbit. The firm previously acquired the companies Hermez and Mir, whose founders Jordi Baylina and Brendan Farmer now lead Polygon Labs' in-house ZK teams.  CoinDesk reported in 2021 that Polygon Labs paid $400 million to acquire Mir and $250 million for Hermez. Sources close to the deal told CoinDesk that Toposware was valued somewhere between $30 million and $50 million. Polygon Labs said in its press release that the acquisition brings the total sum of its investments into ZK teams and technology past $1 billion.  According to Polygon Labs' statement, the Toposware team will integrate with Polygon’s existing ZK teams, helping to develop Polygon’s AggLayer, Chain Development Kit and its layer-2 zkEVM.  “Toposware joining Polygon Labs signals our continued commitment to building the world’s best ZK research and development team,” said Marc Boiron, the CEO of Polygon Labs, in a telegram message to CoinDesk. “ZK technology is central to our overarching strategy, driving initiatives including building the leading aggregated blockchain network with the AggLayer, empowering developers to launch new L2 chains on Ethereum with the CDK, enabling DeFi projects to scale and enhance security with Polygon zkEVM and enhancing the security of Polygon PoS as it becomes ZK enabled.”  Read more: Polygon Acquires Ethereum Scaling Startup Mir for $400M",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MATIC | SPONSORED | ZK,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/06/04/polygon-acquires-zero-knowledge-cryptography-firm-toposware,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1182ca87e4ae835d5c08a5c03c54eaebe63af97f-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ark's creator Burak Keceli has moved on to other things, but the protocol and now Ark Labs is continuing to pursue the goal of building on and enhancing what Lightning has brought to Bitcoin.  The team behind Bitcoin layer-2 protocol Ark has formed a new company that will build a faster, cheaper payments system on the world's largest blockchain, aiming to create a better venue than Lightning Network.  The new firm, Ark Labs, was established to respond to the need for scalable, low-cost bitcoin payments, according to an emailed announcement on Tuesday.  The two primary objectives of the new company are to develop an open implementation of the Ark Protocol and build services for users, the first of which is expected later this year.  Layer-2 protocol Ark is built to allow off-chain payments in a way that avoids what creator Burak Kecli referred to as the ""inbound liquidity"" problem of Lightning.  “Lightning has many problems. But number one to me is the inbound liquidity problem,” Keceli told CoinDesk in an interview a year ago. “Imagine a payment system where you need money to receive money. This doesn't make any sense.”  Keceli has since moved on to other things, but the protocol and the newly formed Ark Labs continued to pursue the goal of building on and enhancing Lightning's contributions to Bitcoin.  Instead of requiring users to commit funds at the outset to establish liquidity, Ark uses service providers who provide 24-hour liquidity services for a fee.  Ark’s off-chain payments use an unspent transaction output (UTXO) model that uses virtual unspent transaction outputs (VTXOs) to facilitate unidirectional, one-time-only payments.

42418043,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcIhB,1717506000,Polygon Spinoff Avail Raises $43M in Series A Funding,"Avail, a blockchain project known for its data availability network, announced Tuesday that it has raised $43 million in a Series A funding round led by Founders Fund, Dragonfly and Cyber Fund.  The news comes three months after Avail, which spun out of Polygon in March 2023, shared it had raised $27 million in seed funding.  Data availability networks like Avail are used to help blockchains store information cheaply and in an easy-to-reference manner. The tech is particularly useful in the context of blockchain scaling, helping layer-2 ""rollup"" networks manage transaction data and other information without relying on the main blockchain layer. This offloading reduces the burden on the main chain, leading to lower costs for end-users.  The fresh round of capital will go towards building out Avail’s Unification Layer, “a cutting-edge modular technology stack that combines data availability, aggregation, and shared security to enable modular blockchains to scale and interoperate permissionlessly and securely,” Avail said in a press release.

Galaxy Digital (GLXY) is well positioned to benefit from resurgent crypto markets, U.S. political leaders’ improving sentiment towards digital assets, and the potential for increased adoption of bitcoin {{BTC}} and other cryptocurrencies, broker Benchmark said in a research report on Tuesday.  Benchmark assumed coverage of the digital assets platform with a buy rating and a C$19 price target. The shares closed over 6% higher on Monday at C$14.76. The company has a “solid balance sheet featuring $1.5 billion in liquidity, trading relationships with 1,161 counterparties, and support of more than 100 different crypto assets,” analyst Mark Palmer wrote.  Improving political sentiment towards crypto, as evidenced by the bipartisan passage of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) last month, improves Galaxy’s operating outlook in the U.S. but also increases the likelihood that the company will be able to list on Nasdaq, the report said.  The approval of 11 spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. in January was another major boost for the company, the note said, and it will likely also see tailwinds from bitcoin price appreciation arising from the recent halving event and from increased institutional demand.  With institutional adoption of digital assets about to take off, “Galaxy is positioned to secure a meaningful share of that market opportunity with GalaxyOne,” the prime brokerage business it launched last November, Palmer wrote.

28914420,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=611366,1717503324,Crypto Analyst Predicts Massive Solana Price Crash Using Elliott Waves,"In a technical analysis, renowned crypto analyst Gert van Lagen presented an extremely bearish outlook for Solana (SOL), suggesting that its price is poised for a substantial downside move. Van Lagen’s analysis is underpinned by the widely acclaimed Elliott Wave Theory, a methodology that seeks to identify recurring patterns and cycles in market price movements. Why The Solana Price Could Crash At the core of Van Lagen’s analysis lies a dissection of Solana’s price action over the past few years. According to his assessment, the year 2021 marked the culmination of a clean Elliott Wave trend for Solana, signaling the end of a bullish cycle. This uptrend is characterized by a specific pattern of five waves, with the final wave acting as the climactic move before a reversal. Moving into 2022, Van Lagen’s analysis identifies the unfolding of the A-wave down, which he classifies as the first leg of a prolonged bear market. Crucially, this A-wave down exhibits a distinct pattern of five subwaves, aligning with the principles of the Elliott Wave Theory. The presence of these subwaves is a key indicator that the downtrend is likely to persist, as they are believed to reflect the underlying market sentiment and psychology. Related Reading: Solana-Based GameStop Tribute Token (GME) Soars 300% Following Roaring Kitty’s Return In 2023, Van Lagen observed the formation of the B-wave, a corrective rally within the broader bear market context. Just like the A-wave, this B-wave is composed of five subwaves, adhering to the Elliott Wave Pattern for corrective movements. The identification of this B-wave is crucial, as it suggests that the overall downtrend has not yet been fully exhausted and that further downside momentum may be forthcoming. As the analysis shifts to 2024, Van Lagen’s expectation is for the C-wave to materialize. In the Elliott Wave Framework, the C-wave is the final leg of the broader bear market cycle, and its occurrence would potentially mark the completion of the ongoing downtrend for Solana. Notably, Van Lagen’s analysis also highlights the presence of bearish divergence on the weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI), a widely used momentum oscillator. Bearish divergence occurs when the price makes higher highs while the RSI fails to confirm these highs, potentially signaling a forthcoming trend reversal or a loss of bullish momentum. Related Reading: Solana Remains Institutional Investors’ Favorite, YTD Flows Ramp Up To $29 Milion Van Lagen posted via X: “I’m short on SOL –> ready for the next leg down. 2021: Finalized a clean Elliottwave up; 2022: A-wave down of prolonged bear market <- 5 subwaves; 2023: B-wave of prolonged bear market <- 3 subwaves; 2024: Expectation is C-wave down. Bearish divergence on the weekly RSI.” Notably, the analyst refrains from specifying an exact price target. However, the blue arrow on the chart suggests that van Lagen anticipates the SOL price could plummet to approximately $13. Such a decline would represent a dramatic price crash of more than 90% from the current price level. A 50% Chance That This Will Happen In his commentary, Van Lagen acknowledged the risks associated with his short position on Solana, characterizing it as a “50/50 trade” and “ballsy.” However, he defended his decision by stating that it is backed by a “good theoretical framework” and serves as a hedge against his long positions in other assets. The analyst emphasized the importance of analyzing the isolated chart without emotion, underscoring the need for objectivity in technical analysis. “Short on SOL is a 50/50 trade, ballsy, but also a hedge against my long positions. There’s good reason to do so when looking at the isolated chart without emotion. It’s a risky trade and I’m aware of it. But also backed by a good theoretical framework,” he stated. While Van Lagen’s analysis presents a bearish outlook for Solana based on the Elliott Wave Theory, it is crucial to recognize that the broader crypto market often moves in tandem with Bitcoin. This correlation raises questions among other market participants. One user encapsulated this sentiment by commenting, “This is really strange. You think BTC will move up in the coming weeks but SOL will move down? We are still in a market structure where big coins don’t move down that much while Bitcoin is moving up.” At press time, SOL traded at $165.

42418045,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcIkH,1717503015,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Drops From $70K as Bullish Signal Strengthens,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin's price fell below $69,000 during the European morning having briefly topped $70,000 late on Monday. BTC is currently priced at about $68,900, down just over 0.2% compared to 24 hours ago. Other major crypto tokens also dropped, and the broader digital asset market, as measured by CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), lost 0.70%. Crypto exchange Bitfinex said on Monday that bitcoin's slump since March was driven by long-term holders selling. This trend has now stalled, however, with the number of net accumulating BTC addresses growing over the past month, a sign of increasing bullish sentiment.  Crypto trading firm DWF Labs will buy $12 million worth of floki tokens from the open market and the Floki treasury to support the dog meme coin-turned-utility project’s growing ecosystem. This follows a previous commitment to purchase $10 million worth of FLOKI in February, which contributed to a 50% jump in FLOKI prices the following week. Floki will release the mainnet version of its flagship utility product, the Valhalla metaverse game, later this year. DWF’s purchases will support the growth of these ventures and provide the requisite liquidity. Floki first announced a partnership with DWF Labs in May 2023, when the trading firm purchased $5 million worth of FLOKI tokens.  Bitpanda enlisted Deutsche Bank to process fiat deposits and withdrawals for its users in Germany. Bitpanda users can now access German international bank account numbers (IBANs), effectively converting crypto to fiat and vice versa. Deutsche Bank will also provide support for incoming and outgoing transactions on Bitpanda. ""Bringing the best parts of the industry together is where we can create real value for people ... From today, we can access a range of Deutsche Bank’s products, unlocking benefits for our team and our users,"" said Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad, Bitpanda's deputy CEO. Deutsche Bank is no stranger to crypto and tokenization, having added crypto custody and tokenization to its repertoire last year through a collaboration with Taurus.

28914000,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=611360,1717502436,"Notcoin (NOT) Maintains Bullish Momentum, What Next?","After a retracement from its previous, Notcoin (NOT) has been exhibiting strong bullish momentum that has drawn the interest of both traders and investors. This ongoing upward trend indicates a robust level of market confidence and increasing optimism over its prospects. Market analysts are keeping a careful eye on important indicators and trends as the cryptocurrency rises in order to predict how long this bullish period may remain and what possible heights it may reach. Using a few technical indicators, we will examine Notcoin’s price possibilities in this article focusing on the 1-hour and the 4-hour timeframe. Notcoin’s price was up by 20% as of the time of writing, trading at approximately $0.025, with a market capitalization of over $2.3 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of over $4.4 billion. In the past day, there has been a 16.33% increase in market capitalization and a 106.31% increase in trading volume. Indicators And A Technical Perspective On Notcoin Price Notcoin is currently trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and remains actively positive in the 1-hour time frame. This suggests that the price is still bullish and that there is still room for price growth. The 1-hour Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) also signals that Notcoin might move bullishly as the MACD histograms are trending above the MACD zero line. In addition, the MACD line and the MACD signal line have crossed each other and are currently trending above the zero line with a good spread between them, suggesting that the price of Notcoin might still move upward. In the 4-hour time frame, it can be observed that NOT, after making a pullback, is attempting another upward bullish rally as it has dropped a bullish candlestick in the last 4 hours. Additionally, the 4-hour MACD displays a bullish signal as the MACD line and the MACD signal line are still highly active above the zero line, and the MACD histograms attempt to rise higher above the zero line. This development suggests that Notcoin is poised for more growth. Future Prospects For The Meme Coin It is worth noting that Notcoin has managed to create a high of $0.029405 and lows of $0.018863, and $0.011381, which are significant milestones in evaluating its price next destination based on its past price action. If Notcoin continues to move upward to the resistance level of $0.029405 and breaks above it, it therefore means that it will move higher to create a new high. However, Notcoin’s price will start to descend in the direction of the $0.018863 support level if it is unable to break above this resistance level. The price may move much farther to test the $0.011381 level and possibly other levels on the chart if it breaks below this support level.

ROAR Explodes Over 300% After Kitty’s GME Move,"The echoes of 2021’s meme stock saga reverberated through financial markets this morning, as the obscure ROAR meme coin and video game retailer GameStop experienced a meteoric rise fueled by social media nostalgia. The catalyst? The return of a familiar face – Keith Gill, better known by his online moniker “Roaring Kitty.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Under The Microscope – Historical Data Points To Rebound Kitty Claws Back In Retail investors were sent scrambling after Gill, a superstar among the online investment community on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum, posted a cryptic message hinting at a significant stake in GameStop. The post, featuring an image of the “Uno Reverse” card, sent speculation into overdrive. Shortly after, Gill confirmed his bullish stance by revealing a massive holding of 5 million GameStop shares, valued at roughly $116 million based on Friday’s closing price. In the 20 minutes that followed Gill’s post, GameStop’s stock price on Robinhood’s overnight markets shot up by 20% to $27.50. This increase followed the stock’s Friday closing price of $23.14. This year, the shares have increased by almost 40%, presumably as a result of Gill’s sudden comeback. This disclosure sent shockwaves through the market. GameStop’s stock, infamous for its volatility during the meme stock frenzy of 2021, surged over 100% at its peak in pre-market trading on Monday. NOW: GameStop soars after the Reddit account that drove the meme-stock mania of 2021 posted what appeared to be a $116 million bet https://t.co/0mnyJF4lIf pic.twitter.com/rpRdA2AIWL — Bloomberg Markets (@markets) June 3, 2024 While the price eventually settled to an impressive 88% increase, the roar from retail investors was undeniable. The ROAR meme coin, seemingly named in homage to Gill’s online persona, mirrored the GameStop price surge of over 300%, reaching a high of $0.001643. A Meme Stock Revival? The sudden rise of both ROAR and GameStop has reignited the debate surrounding meme stocks. These assets, often characterized by high volatility and driven more by online hype than traditional financial metrics, captured the imagination of retail investors in 2021. Gill, who played a pivotal role in the initial GameStop saga, appears to be a key player in this potential revival. However, analysts remain cautious. GameStop itself is in a precarious position, having recently sold a massive chunk of shares to bolster its finances while facing continued net losses and projected sales declines. The company’s long-term prospects remain uncertain, raising questions about whether this is a genuine resurgence or simply a nostalgic echo of 2021. Related Reading: Notcoin Unstoppable!

Ethereum leverages blockchain technology but extends beyond being just a cryptocurrency. The price of Ethereum is influenced by market sentiment, driven by news, social media, and overall attitude towards the crypto market, which significantly impacts Ethereum’s price. Dive into our expert analysis of Ethereum as an investment, covering its market dynamics, technological strengths, and long-term potential. Since its release in 2015, Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) adoption has grown exponentially, attracting hundreds of millions of users, and gaining the attention of mainstream investment firms and payment applications. As a decentralized platform enabling smart contracts and distributed applications (dApps) to be built and run without any downtime, fraud, control, or interference from a third party, Ethereum stands out in the cryptocurrency world. This article evaluates Ethereum's potential as an investment, considering its unique position and future prospects in the evolving financial landscape. Understanding Ethereum: More Than Just a Cryptocurrency Ethereum leverages blockchain technology but extends beyond being just a cryptocurrency. The Ethereum Virtual Machine ((EVM)) is central to its operations, differentiating it from other digital currencies. The EVM, a sandboxed virtual stack embedded within each Ethereum node, executed bytecode and smart contracts - self-executing contracts with terms directly written into code, operating without downtime, censorship, or fraud. This innovation shifts the paradigm from traditional contracts requiring intermediaries to automated, trustless transactions. Market Dynamics: Assessing Ethereum's Investment Viability Price Influences: Market Sentiment and Global Trends The price of Ethereum is influenced by market sentiment, driven by news, social media, and overall attitude towards the crypto market, which significantly impacts Ethereum's price. Positive news about institutional adoption can lead to price surges, while negative sentiment, such as fears of regulatory crackdowns, can cause price drops. Market Sentiment : Investor sentiment plays a crucial role in the cryptocurrency market, often driven by news, social media, and overall investor attitude towards the crypto space. For example, positive news about institutional adoption of Ethereum can lead to price surges, as seen when large financial institutions announce their support for Ethereum or when there's a growing interest in decentralized finance platforms built on Ethereum. Conversely, negative sentiment, such as the spreading of unfounded rumors or fears of a regulatory crackdown, can lead to significant price drops. Global Economic Trends : Macroeconomic factors such as inflation rates, interest rates, and economic policies in major economies can significantly impact Ethereum's price. For instance, during times of high inflation, some investors may turn to cryptocurrencies like Ethereum as a hedge against their local currency's devaluation. Similarly, changes in monetary policy, such as the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions, can influence investor appetite for riskier assets like Ethereum. Regulatory Changes : The regulatory environment surrounding cryptocurrencies is continually evolving and can have immediate impacts on their prices. Positive regulatory news, such as a country legalizing cryptocurrencies or clarifying tax guidance, can lead to price increases. Conversely, negative regulatory actions, such as bans or restrictive regulations in significant markets like the US, China, or South Korea, can lead to sharp declines in price. For example, China's crackdown on cryptocurrency mining and trading in 2021 led to a significant drop in the price of Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. Technological Developments : Advances in Ethereum's technology or its ecosystem can also influence its price. The transition from Ethereum 1.0 to Ethereum 2.0, with its shift to proof-of-stake (PoS), aimed to reduce transaction fees and increase transaction speed and energy efficiency. Such upgrades can lead to positive price movements as they address scalability and cost issues. However, delays or problems in these technological upgrades can lead to negative market reactions. Historical Price Analysis: From Launch to 2024 Ethereum has experienced significant volatility since its launch, reflecting market dynamics, technological milestones, and investor sentiment. 2017 Boom: Ethereum's first major price increase occurred in 2017, peaking at around $1,400 in early 2018, alongside a broader cryptocurrency market boom. 2020-2021 Growth: Significant growth in 2020 and 2021 saw Ethereum reaching new highs above $4,000, driven by its growing adoption and the booming DeFi sector. Crypto ETFs: The adoption of Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) has further boosted Ethereum's price. ETFs provide a regulated way to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies, attracting both individual and institutional investors and increasing demand for Ethereum. Ethereum's Investment Appeal: Should You Buy Ethereum? Investing in Ethereum is about more than just buying a cryptocurrency; it's about investing in a platform with wide-ranging applications, from DeFi to tokenization and beyond. In our view, the investment case for Ethereum is strong and diverse: Technological Edge : Ethereum's platform allows for creating smart contracts, programs that automatically execute when certain conditions are met. This feature has huge potential in reshaping industries, from finance to art. Market Share : Ethereum's platform supports numerous other cryptocurrencies. Its influence is clear when you consider that, as of September 2023, 10 of the top 20 cryptocurrencies are based on or linked to Ethereum. Applications : Ethereum's versatility extends beyond cryptocurrencies to DeFi, games, and major organizations integrating blockchain technology. Ethereum vs Other Investment Options: A Comparative Analysis Comparing Ethereum with traditional investment options such as stocks, bonds, or even other cryptocurrencies is crucial for understanding its unique risk and reward profile. While Ethereum offers high growth potential, it also comes with higher volatility and risks, particularly regulatory and technological challenges. Bitcoin: Often viewed as a store of value or digital gold, bitcoin appeals to investors seeking a hedge against economic instability. Ethereum: With its broad utility and foundational role in DeFi and NFT spaces, Ethereum presents a different investment proposition focused on decentralized technology's potential. Ethereum's Long-Term Investment Potential Expert predictions for Ethereum are generally optimistic, though they acknowledge the potential for volatility driven by regulatory changes, technological advancements, and market adoption. Ethereum is undergoing a significant transition to Ethereum 2.0, which promises to bring scalability, security, and sustainability improvements through the shift to Proof of Stake and the introduction of sharding. These developments could significantly impact their performance, adoption, and investor interest, presenting both challenges and opportunities for the future. Ethereum Price Forecasting Thanks to improving functionality, lower take-rates, and an ethos of inclusivity, we are bullish on decentralized software protocols as an alternative to existing intermediaries. Among the contenders to capture a majority of economic value-as is common in digital platforms-Ethereum stands out to us as one of the most probable long-term disruptors. According to our recent analysis , we believe Ethereum may emerge as a powerhouse among digital assets, with a predicted token price of $11.8k by 2030. Ethereum's unique approach combines a globally distributed infrastructure, smart contract capabilities, and a digital commerce model that enables trustless transactions. Conclusion Ethereum's unique combination of technological innovation, market influence, and application versatility sets it apart from other cryptocurrencies and traditional investment options alike. Ethereum's foundational technology, the Ethereum Virtual Machine, and its pioneering smart contract functionality, represent a seismic shift in how we conceive of and execute contractual agreements and transactions. By eliminating intermediaries and enabling decentralized applications, Ethereum has laid the groundwork for a future where decentralized finance and other blockchain-based solutions can flourish. The price of Ethereum, subject to the ebb and flow of market sentiment, global economic trends, regulatory landscapes, and technological advancements, underscores the volatile yet potentially rewarding nature of investing in digital assets. Noteworthy is Ethereum's adaptability and resilience in the face of these challenges, highlighted by its ongoing transition to Ethereum 2.0. This upgrade promises to address some of the most significant concerns surrounding scalability and sustainability, further solidifying Ethereum's position in the market. Looking ahead, the long-term investment potential of Ethereum seems optimistic, driven by its technological advancements, growing adoption, and the broadening scope of its applications. However, as with any investment, potential investors should approach with caution, recognizing the inherent volatility and risks associated with the cryptocurrency market. Important Disclosures Definitions Bitcoin (BTC) is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer Bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries. Ethereum (ETH) is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality. Ether is the native cryptocurrency of the platform. Amongst cryptocurrencies, Ether is second only to Bitcoin in market capitalization.

While the release acknowledged that ASIC had been unsuccessful in arguing that Access needed a license, Jackman upheld Block Earner's allegation that it was ""unfair and misleading.""  Jackman also determined that the fintech company should be relieved of paying a penalty for Earner because it acted honestly in seeking to engage with the government over regulation of crypto-related products and services. ASIC was ordered to pay costs incurred by Block Earner after the federal court's Feb. 9 judgement.  “The court rightly calls out ‘a deeper issue’ that the ‘rules of the legal system are promulgated and clear’ noting that obtaining legal advice in an emerging area like crypto will support an argument for relief from a penalty,"" Blockchain Australia Chair Michael Bacina said in a statement.  “Crypto projects which charge ahead without seeking proper legal advice not only risk their products infringing the law, but also remove a potential argument for relief of a penalty in the event an innovative product in an area of unclear guidance end up being found to be infringing.”  Read More: Australian Court Hands Over $41 Million of Crypto Held by Blockchain Mining Group at Regulator's Request  UPDATE (June 4, 9:24 UTC): Shortens wording in bullet points.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MINING | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Jamie Crawley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/06/04/australian-regulator-scolded-over-misleading-release-must-pay-costs-as-block-earner-avoids-penalty,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d14414b88fb29112bf7204d1d7c33be73530a02d-1414x795.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

28906610,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=611324,1717491017,"Best Long-Term Bitcoin Buy Signal Flashes, Hedge Fund CEO Warns","In his latest dispatch, Charles Edwards, CEO of the Bitcoin and digital asset hedge fund Capriole, has flagged a significant market indicator in the latest edition of the firm’s newsletter, Update #51. Edwards points to the activation of the “Hash Ribbons” buy signal, a notable event that has historically indicated prime buying opportunities for Bitcoin. Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Flash Buy Signal The Hash Ribbons indicator, first introduced in 2019, utilizes mining data to predict long-term buying opportunities based on miners’ economic pressures. The signal arises from the convergence of short-term and long-term moving averages of Bitcoin’s hash rate, specifically when the 30-day moving average falls below the 60-day. According to Edwards, this event has “in the vast majority of cases synced with broader Bitcoin market weakness, price volatility and significantly long-term value opportunities.” The current Miner Capitulation, as highlighted by Edwards, began two weeks ago and coincides with post-halving adjustments in the mining sector. This period often leads to the shuttering of operations and even bankruptcies among less efficient miners. Edwards notes, “Just as we are seeing today, these mining rigs will typically then be phased out over several weeks following the Halving resulting in falling hash rates.” Despite the historical profitability of miners, especially with increased block fees from new applications such as Ordinals and Runes, Edwards suggests that the market should not overlook the current opportunity signaled by the latest Miner Capitulation. “While this capitulation is occurring when miners have broadly been profitable, we would be remiss not to note this rare opportunity,” stated Edwards. Related Reading: The Half-Million Dollar Bitcoin: Predictions Point To Monumental Price Surge In 18 Months The Hash Ribbons have not been without their critics, with each occurrence stirring debate about the current relevance and accuracy of the signal. Edwards addressed these criticisms by referencing the previous year’s signal, which correlated with Bitcoin trading in the $20,000 range, reinforcing the indicator’s predictive strength. “Every occurrence brings some debate about their relevance today, or why the current signal perhaps doesn’t count,” Edwards explained. Edwards recommends that the safest approach to leveraging the Hash Ribbons is by waiting for confirmation through renewed hash rate growth and a positive price trend. He concludes, “The safest (lowest volatility opportunity) to allocate to the Hash Ribbons strategy is on confirmation of the Hash Ribbon Buy which is triggered by renewed Hash Rate growth (30DMA>60DMA) and a positive price trend (as defined by the 10DMA>20DMA of price).” Broader Market Context Transitioning from the technical to the contextual, Edwards discusses the changing regulatory landscape that has recently become more favorable to cryptocurrencies. The SEC’s approval of an Ethereum ETF, categorizing ETH as a commodity, marks a significant shift in the regulatory approach towards cryptocurrencies and reflects growing institutional acceptance. Related Reading: Is This The Biggest Bitcoin Bull Run Ever? Analyst Says Yes! “The reclassification of Ethereum and the approval of its ETF represent a pivotal shift in governmental stance on cryptocurrencies,” Edwards notes. “This could lead to increased institutional involvement and potentially more stability in the crypto markets.” Furthermore, Edwards points to macroeconomic factors that could influence Bitcoin’s value. The expansion of the M2 money supply and the Federal Reserve’s stance on interest rates are designed to stimulate economic activity. However, Edwards warns of the potential long-term consequences of these policies, such as inflation, which could enhance Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge against monetary devaluation. “Bitcoin was conceptualized as an alternative to traditional financial systems in times of economic stress,” Edwards remarks. “The current economic policies reinforce the fundamental reasons for Bitcoin’s existence and could lead to increased adoption.” On the technical front, Edwards provides an analysis of Bitcoin’s price movements, highlighting the recent breakout and consolidation above critical resistance levels. He sets a conditional mid-term price target of $100,000, contingent upon the market sustaining its current momentum and the monthly close remaining above a critical threshold of $58,000.

This discovery has ignited a spark of optimism among DOGE holders, with some analysts predicting a similar outcome in the coming weeks or months. #Doge monthly : it’s just a symphony !#dogecoin $DOGEUSD #XD #FTW #PeopleCurrency #ThisIsTheWay @xpayments 𝕏Ð pic.twitter.com/bPiPcNTH3l — Olivier Ð 𝕏 (@Dark64) June 1, 2024 Technically, things seem to be lining up for a potential surge. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) and Relative Strength Index (RSI), indicators used to gauge buying and selling pressure, are both exhibiting positive trends, suggesting an increase in investor confidence. Additionally, some analysts believe that if DOGE manages to turn bullish, it could face its first resistance level at $0.16, with a potential breakout leading it to $0.17. Short-Term Blues And Bearish Whispers However, not all signs point towards sunshine and rainbows for Dogecoin. Despite the recent price uptick, the overall market sentiment surrounding DOGE remains stubbornly bearish. This negativity is reflected in a significant decline in weighted sentiment, an indicator that measures the overall tone of social media conversations about the coin. Social volume, which tracks the number of mentions DOGE receives online, has also dropped in recent weeks, suggesting waning interest from the community. Furthermore, short-term metrics like trading volume and velocity paint a concerning picture. Trading volume, which indicates the frequency of DOGE being bought and sold, has dipped considerably over the past week. Dogecoin Price Prediction Meanwhile, despite a recent stretch with 43% positive days and relatively low volatility, technical indicators for Dogecoin are pointing bearish. The current prediction forecasts a price drop of over 13% by July 4th, reaching $0.135. Related Reading: Is This The Ethereum Endgame?

IREN's business model involves selling the Bitcoin it mines, which simplifies its operations and reduces the likelihood of dilution. IREN's co-CEOs, who have relevant experience in infrastructure and capital markets, contribute to its potential for growth and outperformance in the market. Investing in Bitcoin mining is capricious and highly speculative. Nonetheless, they remain one of few publicly traded methods offering the opportunity for leveraged returns relative to the performance of Bitcoin. During this cycle, I believe there may be a new best choice among the Bitcoin miners trading on an exchange within the United States. I hope to explain some of the reasons I have added exposure to Iris Energy ( IREN ), with the expectation it should be one of the best performing large Bitcoin miners available within the domestic marketplace. The primary reason IREN appears to offer a greater opportunity than most of the large peer Bitcoin miners is due to it being less known. IREN was not publicly traded in advance of the last halving and Bitcoin’s prior peaking back in 2021. In fact, IREN had the dubious timing of going public on November 17, 2021, which coincided with the start of a two-year downturn. Now, though, we are back to and through those 2021 highs, with the potential to develop new peaks. Google Finance with red data by ZVI BAR Another reason IREN may have remained less visible is due to it being incorporated under the laws of New South Wales, Australia. Also, the company was previously known as Iris Energy, and only rebranded itself as IREN in February of this year. Please note that back in 2020, I took the opposite approach, believing that the oldest and best known Bitcoin miners like Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) and Marathon Digital Holdings ( MARA ) were the best bets due to the scrutiny they sustained through the prior cycle (See articles from August , November , and December 2020). What’s rather interesting to me is that despite being one of the newer miners, IREN's model appears to be more traditional. What I mean by this is that IREN actually sells what it mines. Conversely, most of the large publicly traded Bitcoin miners switched to a ‘hodl’ strategy. While this distinction may reduce the potential for significant revaluation of the balance sheet, it also leaves IREN with a much simpler business model that allows for less shenanigans at the corporate level. In particular, without selling what is mined, such miners should be expected to have a greater likelihood of substantial future dilution. I also suspect the development of an increasing correlation with excessive executive compensation and those corporate structures that do not prioritize operating business revenue. This is not to say that IREN is unlikely to dilute existing shareholders. Quite the contrary, as IREN will definitely dilute shareholders and even issued a shelf secondary offering in May of this year. Rather, I expect all Bitcoin miners that are attempting to grow their hash-rate must and shall do dilutive secondaries, or some sort of dilutive financing. Simply put, those with a hodl strategy are more likely to require more secondaries in order to finance their growing exahash ambitions due to a lack of operating cash flow. It should be recognized that IREN responded exceedingly well in the wake of announcing the most recent shelf secondary last month. In fact, valuation spiked upward after the company reported its quarterly results and the secondary details. Spiking upwards after reporting a secondary is a very positive sign, as the normal response to a secondary is to re-price lower. This is a strong indication that the market is beginning to recognize that IREN is undervalued and starting to re-value it to fall more in line with its peers. IREN Q3 Earnings Presentation IREN is already among the largest publicly traded Bitcoin miners in terms of both market capitalization and installed hashrate. Further, it is one of few that is currently profitable. This is not merely because they mine Bitcoin for less than their costs, but because they have made the decision to sell Bitcoin on a daily basis. This provides not merely profit but usable positive operating cash flow. IREN's operating efficiency and mining capacity indicates it should be reevaluated closer to the market valuation of RIOT. If the company can reach its lofty exahash growth goals, it is likely to deserve a greater valuation than that. At the moment, RIOT has a market capitalization of about $2.8 billion, while IREN's market cap is about $1.1 billion. Even if we were to split the difference, that would indicate IREN should have a roughly $2.0 billion market cap, or about $16 per share. If IREN makes good on its expectations of reaching 30 EH/s by the end of 2024, and Bitcoin pricing maintains or increases in the interim, a proper valuation would likely be $3-4 billion, and potentially well over $20 per share. IREN's operating cash flow is being reinvested into the company's ambitions for growth, and not only their Bitcoin mining operations. IREN's business model grew to include data centers for power-hungry processes such as generative AI and related complex computing. Operating AI data centers should be a very complementary business to Bitcoin mining, as both require large optimized facilities with access to competitively priced energy, and ideally renewable energy. This secondary line of business is likely to smooth out IREN's performance through future Bitcoin cycles, and could eventually attract a second investor base. It seems reasonably likely that investors will increasingly allocate into high-speed parallel processing of complex computations that are powered by cheap and renewable energy sources. It also seems somewhat probable that the marketplace will eventually lump both business models under a combined asset class that I currently think of as nodes acting as utilities. The main difference between IREN's two business divisions is that the Bitcoin model mining requires Application-Specific Integrated Circuit ('ASIC') hardware, while the AI model requires Graphics Processing Unit ('GPU') hardware. In addition to having two lines of business, IREN also has co-CEOs. They are the co-founding brothers and both appear qualified for the tasks at hand, with highly relevant experience. Dan and Will Roberts also both have experience working at divisions of Macquarie, which is not only one of Australia's larger financial services conglomerates, but also the world's largest infrastructure asset managers. Daniel Roberts worked at Macquarie Capital and subsequently became part of Palisade Investment Partners, an infrastructure fund manager. Will Roberts was a vice president at Macquarie Group in the Commodities & Global Markets division that makes investments in mining projects and manages commodity price risk. Further, Will co-founded Macquarie’s Digital Assets team. IREN is not one of the older and better known Bitcoin miners, but it is among the faster growing large and publicly traded ones. Further, IREN is co-founded and run by seemingly serious co-CEO brothers that have highly relevant infrastructure and capital markets experience. The company has set forth ambitious growth projections for its Bitcoin mining capacity and is also diversifying into the business of AI data centers. IREN appears undervalued relative to peer publicly traded bitcoin miners. It is likely that this undervaluation is at least partially due to it entering the marketplace after the prior cycle. IREN also has the potential for less than average dilution compared to other publicly traded Bitcoin miners. This makes it substantially likely that it will outperform those peers in the near term.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | ICO | MARKET | MINING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4697273-iren-stock-likely-to-outperform-peer-bitcoin-miners-during-the-next-cycle?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/28903869.jpeg

42418046,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcIjF,1717484763,Epoch Times CFO Charged With $67M Fraud Scheme Involving Crypto Platform,"Epoch Times CFO Bill Guan was charged with participating in a scheme to launder $67 million in illicit funds to benefit himself and the company.  The scheme involved using cryptocurrency to purchase crime proceeds at a discount and funneling them into the company's accounts, leading to a significant increase in Epoch Times' reported annual revenue.  Epoch Times chief financial officer Bill Guan was indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) early Tuesday. The DoJ accused him of being involved in a scheme to launder $67 million using crypto.  Epoch is a popular political conservative media outlet known for its criticism of the Chinese government.  Guan is accused of spearheading a scheme in which he managed Epoch’s “Make Money Online” team overseas from in or about 2020 through or about May 2024. These charges do not concern the firm’s news and information-gathering activities.  “Under Guan’s management, members of the team and others used cryptocurrency to knowingly purchase tens of millions of dollars in crime proceeds, including proceeds of fraudulently obtained unemployment insurance benefits, that had been loaded onto tens of thousands of prepaid debit cards,” DoJ said.  The proceeds were then allegedly “laundered” through a certain cryptocurrency platform and turned into an unspecified cryptocurrency at 70 to 80 cents on the dollar. Team members then used stolen personal identification information to open accounts and funnel the profits there and subsequently into accounts held in their own names.  These funds were then further laundered through other bank accounts held by the media entity’s accounts, Guan’s personal bank accounts and through his crypto accounts.  Guan faces charges of conspiring to commit money laundering and bank fraud. The money laundering charge carries a maximum sentence of 20 years, while each bank fraud charge could result in up to 30 years imprisonment, as per the DoJ indictment.  Hints of possible wrongdoing emerged after investigators started looking into the company’s 410% increase in annual revenue, which flew to $62 million from a relatively lesser $15 million. Guan claimed the boost in funds came from “donations” at the time, which riled suspicion.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/06/04/epoch-times-cfo-charged-with-67m-fraud-scheme-involving-crypto-platform,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/022c3986c0b56cc47311ad77d9083a0da6bbeede-5603x3152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42418039,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcId3,1717482458,Bitcoin Sees Profit-Taking Around $70K Amid ‘Stubbornly Bullish’ Sentiment,"Bitcoin price dipped to $69,200 amidst profit-taking and broader U.S. stock market movements.  Despite negative news, sentiment remains bullish due to long-term holder conviction and anticipation of further spot ETF approvals.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} slid to $69,200 early Tuesday amid profit-taking after briefly crossing the $70,000 level late Monday. Price action across major tokens was mixed.  BTC prices moved alongside broader U.S. stock markets, reflecting risky bets in the market. Some meme stocks and tokens jumped more than 100% on the apparent return of influential equity trader Keith Gill.  Crypto exchange Bitfinex said in a report on Monday that bitcoin’s slump since March was likely driven by long-term holders selling. However, blockchain data shows the trend has stalled, and investors are accumulating BTC.  On-chain analysis firm CryptoQuant shared with CoinDesk in a Tuesday report that 50% of the long-term bitcoin supply was “inactive,” showing no movements or changes in holdings across tracked wallets. This is considered a sign of strong long-term conviction, which may indicate further price gains.  As such, the sentiment around bitcoin’s continued growth remains “stubbornly bullish,” with Singapore-based QCP Capital seeing an increase in trading activity.  “The market remains stubbornly bullish in spite of negative headlines about Mt. Gox and the DMM hack last week, BTC rallied confidently above $69,000 in Asia,” QCP said in a broadcast message late Monday. “This bullishness is likely to continue as the market waits for the ETH spot ETF to usher in new demand.”  “Another reason for persistent bullishness is speculators increasing long positions in other crypto majors in anticipation of additional spot ETF approvals in the near future,” the firm said.  Elsewhere, ether {{ETH}} and dogecoin {{DOGE}} showed slight losses, while Cardano’s ADA and Solana’s SOL rose as much as 3%. The CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a broad-based index of the largest tokens minus stablecoins, is up 0.41% in the past 24 hours.

Alongside this positive trend, Ethereum (ETH) has seen a notable turnaround in investor sentiment as the long-awaited spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the market’s second-largest cryptocurrency received approval from the US regulators last week. Record-Breaking Month For Crypto Products According to a recent report from research firm CoinShares, digital asset investment products consistently attracted inflows during the four weeks, amassing a total of $185 million. May proved to be particularly fruitful, with inflows surpassing $2 billion. This achievement marks the first time on record that year-to-date inflows have exceeded the $15 billion mark, highlighting investors’ growing interest in the crypto market. Related Reading: Solana-Based GameStop Tribute Token (GME) Soars 300% Following Roaring Kitty’s Return Most inflows originated from the United States, with a net inflow of $130 million. However, it is worth noting that ETF issuers experienced outflows amounting to $260 million. Switzerland also witnessed a significant uptick in investor interest, recording its second-largest weekly inflow this year at $36 million. Meanwhile, Canada witnessed a positive turnaround, with inflows of $25 million, despite experiencing a net outflow of $39 million in May. Ethereum Rebounds With $200M Inflows Per the report, Bitcoin (BTC) continued to dominate the crypto market, attracting inflows totaling $148 million. Conversely, short-Bitcoin products witnessed another week of outflows, amounting to $3.5 million, suggesting that sentiment among ETF investors remains largely positive for the leading cryptocurrency. Ethereum, on the other hand, experienced a notable change in investor sentiment following the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of a spot-based ETF that is expected to launch in July 2024. CoinShares notes that this approval marked a turning point for Ethereum, which had endured ten weeks of outflows totaling $200 million. Interestingly, the positive news for Ethereum had a ripple effect on Solana (SOL), which received an additional $5.8 million in inflows last week. Related Reading: Bitcoin, Ethereum On Exchanges Drop To New Lows, What A Supply Squeeze Would Mean For The Market While direct investments in crypto assets have been thriving, blockchain equities faced a different scenario. In the past week alone, blockchain equities witnessed outflows of $7.2 million.

At the time of writing, Ethereum has seen a 4% price drop in the last week, resulting in a trading price of $3,770.

This begins from 2013 and moves to present time, showing how the performance of XRP has actually flattened during this time. “Significant historical price spikes, particularly in 2017 and 2018, are visible, which is what we are looking at for 2024 and 2025 years as we see some movement consistency between the two cycles,” the analyst stated. With interesting rising, these indicators could point toward an important breakout for the price. If this happens, the crypto analyst has outlined targets for how high the price could go. How High Can The Price Go? One major factor in the analyst’s prediction is the fact that such historical patterns have been previously bullish for XRP to have returned. The analyst points out that a rally usually breaks out when these patterns have seen a 75% completion. However, the current patterns have reached 88.93% completion, suggesting that a breakout is long overdue for the XRP price.

If approved by District Court Judge Victor of the Southern District of New York (SDNY), the settlement would bring a nearly three-year-long legal battle to an end.  In 2021, the class action plaintiffs accused Dapper Labs’ flagship product – the NBA Top Shot Moments – of being unregistered securities because, they said, the value of the NFTs would increase with the popularity of the project as a whole. Plaintiffs also claimed that Dapper Labs prevented investors from cashing out for “months on end” to keep value locked on the platform, and did not allow Moments to be bought or sold on outside NFT platforms at the time the suit was filed.  In subsequent court filings, Dapper Labs’ lawyers vehemently denied that their NFTs were securities, arguing that they were essentially digital basketball cards.  The settlement agreement filed Monday would bar the plaintiffs from claiming that their NFTs are securities, in exchange for an aggregate settlement fund of $4 million. According to Gharegozlou, the money will go towards payments to the class members, attorneys’ fees and settlement administrator costs.  Dapper Labs also agreed to other business changes to settle the suit, according to a representative for the company, including the implementation of mandatory employee training programs focused on “compliance with federal securities laws and ethical marketing practices” and increased payment and withdrawal speeds.  Additionally, Dapper Labs promised to relinquish any control over its remaining FLOW tokens to the Flow Foundation to ensure the decentralization of the Flow ecosystem.  Though the proposed settlement is between Dapper Labs and investors, not regulators, Gharegozlou told CoinDesk the agreement was a “great start” towards increased legal clarity on whether the company’s NFTs can be classified as securities.  “We are continuing to push for more overarching regulatory clarity to showcase that consumer NFTs are not financial products and, as such, should be regulated under well-established consumer protection regimes at the state level,” Gharegozlou said. “This includes pushing for legislation at the federal level that makes it clear that consumer product NFTs, such as NBA Top Shot, are not subject to federal financial regulation.”  Gharegozlou added that the company is “not aware of any regulator” like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) claiming that Moments NFTs are securities.

Despite surpassing its previous high and reaching a record all-time high (ATH) of $73,700 in March, BTC experienced a 20% price correction to around $56,500 at the beginning of May. However, this correction marked the start of a renewed bullish momentum, with BTC currently trading at approximately $69,300. While Bitcoin’s price has seen some volatility and a lack of sustained bullish action, venture capitalist and market expert Chamath Palihapitiya has provided optimistic predictions for the cryptocurrency’s future. Bitcoin Price And Halving Analysis In a recent episode of the All In Podcast, Palihapitiya analyzed BTC’s historical patterns about the Halving event, which occurs approximately every four years and reduces the block reward given to miners. The venture capitalist noted that after a Halving, investors typically spend the first three months reassessing the price and the overall market situation. However, significant price appreciation has historically occurred within six to 18 months. Related Reading: Is Polkadot Preparing For A 100% Surge And Spike Above $20? To support his analysis, Palihapitiya referred to the previous Halving events. For further context, the first Halving took place on November 28, 2012, reducing the block reward from 50 BTC to 25 BTC. At the time of the Halving, Bitcoin was priced at $13, and within a year, it peaked at $1,152. The second Halving occurred on July 16, 2016, reducing the block reward to 12.5 BTC. Bitcoin’s price at that time was $664, and within a year, it peaked at $17,760. The most recent Halving occurred on May 11, 2020, reducing the block reward to 6.25 BTC. During that halving, Bitcoin was priced at $9,734, and within a year, it reached an all-time high of $69,000. Based on these historical patterns and applying the average increases from previous Halvings, Palihapitiya suggests that if Bitcoin continues to follow its performance from the last market cycle, it could skyrocket to around $500,000 by October 2025, as seen in the chart above. Notably, the expert believes that as Bitcoin’s value appreciates to such levels, it has the potential to replace gold and serve as a transactional utility for hard assets. This scenario, combined with concerns about the debasement of fiat currencies, presents intriguing opportunities for Bitcoin’s future. Increased Demand For BTC? Palihapitiya further argued during the interview that as more countries adopt a dual-currency approach, with Bitcoin being recognized as a valuable asset alongside their local currency, the demand for Bitcoin will increase. This shift would only occur as people recognize the need for Bitcoin in daily transactions for goods and services and as a store of value for permanent assets. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts ‘Major Impulse’ Move For Bitcoin, Here’s The Target Overall, Palihapitiya’s analysis of Bitcoin’s historical patterns following the Halving events provides an optimistic outlook for the cryptocurrency’s price. The potential for Bitcoin to reach $500,000 by October 2025 and its growing recognition as a dual-currency asset alongside fiat currencies offers renewed prospects for investors and the broader cryptocurrency market.
