42393233,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgjUi3,1687996466,Azuki ‘Elementals’ Mint Mishap Highlights the Fragile State of the NFT Market,"On Tuesday, non-fungible token (NFT) brand Azuki opened up sales for its new “Elementals” NFT collection, a 20,000-edition derivative of its wildly-popular, original Azuki collection. The new release was teased to major fanfare, as passionate holders waited for the latest expansion of the anime-inspired Azuki ecosystem.  Collectors have held their breath – and their bags – waiting for signs of growth from Azuki, which teased ambitious plans for a metaverse platform, interactive experiences, physical goods and a native token earlier this year. And while the project has released collaborations with fashion brand Ambush and an impressive but impractical NFT-backed golden skateboard, its last major expansion to its character universe came from the release of its BEANZ collection in March 2022. Azuki has also faced some major challenges in recent months, including a hack on its Twitter account and an admission from its founder that he had abandoned past projects, rocking confidence in the project.  Still, Azuki has largely remained at the top of the NFT leaderboard since it launched in January 2022, despite market conditions that have worsened over time. According to data from secondary marketplace OpenSea, the project has raked in 588,674 ETH or just over $1 billion, in trading volume. BEANZ has also provided major cash to Chiru Labs, the parent company behind Azuki. According to OpenSea, the project has brought in 166,373 ETH, or about $304 million, in trading volume.  To maintain momentum, the team needed a major win.  Enter Azuki “Elementals,” which NFT holders hoped would reinforce the project’s foundations and propel the brand forward. But despite best efforts, the mint was tainted with technical issues, questionable mint mechanics and allegedly duplicated artwork that sunk the Azuki and BEANZ floor prices. At the time of writing, the floor price for Elementals NFTs was hovering around 1.5 ETH (about $2,700) on OpenSea, falling below its original mint price of 2 ETH in just over 24 hours – meaning that holders were selling at a loss.  Considering Azuki’s dominance, the latest mint mishap has broader implications for the NFT market and highlights how even blue-chip NFT projects are struggling to grow during a particularly challenging bear market.  15 minutes to mint  In true Azuki fashion, the Elementals mint generated hype before it even began.  Last Friday, the Azuki team held a token-gated event in Las Vegas called “Follow the Rabbit,” where they airdropped a portion of the unrevealed Elemental NFTs to holders in attendance. On Monday, the team announced details of the mint, explaining that the remaining Elemental NFTs would be sold in 10-minute rounds – first to holders of Azuki NFTs, then to BEANZ holders and then to the general public. The sale was meant to be held Dutch auction style, where the price of the NFTs would begin at 2 ETH and would decrease by 0.1 ETH, or about $200, every five minutes until all of the NFTs were sold.  On Tuesday, eager Azuki community members flocked to the minting site to purchase NFTs at 2 ETH each. Within 15 minutes, all of the NFTs had sold out, bringing in 20,000 ETH in primary sales, worth just over $38 million at the time. According to Punk 9059, director of research atPROOF, one holder spent over $1.5 million on several hundred NFTs.  But while the mint initially appeared a success, many disgruntled holders took to Twitter to express their frustrations with the way it played out.  Of the 10,000 NFTs available during the presale, 7,600 were minted by Azuki holders, said pseudonymous Azuki co-founder Location TBA, leaving BEANZ holders to scramble for the remaining 2,400. Some Azuki holders complained that because of technical difficulties, they weren’t able to mint at all.  Twitter user BenWasOnline said that despite having “multiple browsers prepped and loaded,” he still experienced technical issues that prevented him from participating in the sale.  “Congratulations for selling out in this market, but you guys just really disappointed a huge amount of your collectors,"" BenWasOnline wrote.  In response, Location TBA posted a Twitter thread apologizing for the disruptions and blamed some of the issues on greater-than-expected traffic to the site.  “The team and I feel gutted over what happened. We wanted to put together a dope experience for you all,” said Location TBA. “I take personal responsibility for what happened, and should have lengthened the presale windows.”  ‘Basically identical’ artwork  Frustration continued to mount after the mint when the Azuki team finally revealed the NFT art to anxious holders. Soon after, several collectors alleged that the Elementals collection featured strikingly similar artwork to the original Azuki collection – even down to the metadata of some NFTs.  While some collectors were excited about their NFTs, others were disappointed in what appeared to be a perfunctory artistic endeavor.  Twitter user PlantedSlightly wrote in a since-deleted tweet that the move felt “back-handed” as a dedicated collector.  “Collecting Azukis always felt special, doesn’t feel like that today for me. I’m more sad than angry or disappointed,” tweeted PlantedSlightly. “99% of the mistakes were too obvious to miss.”  User Cirrus NFT pointed out an even more egregious dupe, with what appeared to be two identical NFTs in the same collection. Another user pointed out a similar issue across multiple pairs of identical NFTs.  Azuki co-founder 2PM Flow was quick to attribute the error to a “technical glitch where the metadata for a few tokens were processed incorrectly.” It appears that the metadata for these NFTs has since been corrected.  In the wake of the artwork’s reveal, some users speculated that Azuki purposefully diluted the value of its collection through a massive increase in the supply – an accusation that Azuki later apologized for.  The challenges of a vicious bear market  In the hours following the Elementals mint, the floor price of Azuki plummeted as collectors responded to the controversy. While Azuki said that the mint was meant to “welcome new members into the community,” over 94% of the Elementals NFTs remained in the wallets of existing Azuki members, Nansen tweeted on Wednesday.  Pseudonymous Twitter influencer NFT God suggested that the mint reflected a broader dilemma that profile-picture (PFP) NFT collections – popularized on social media during the bull run – face during market downturn.  “They had 2 options: Do nothing, people sell, and the price goes down, or dilute their collection with even more NFTs, people sell, and the price goes down,” said NFT God.  NFT collector and creative Charlotte Fang told CoinDesk that in recent months, PFP projects have been forced to find new ways to extract value from their holders in order to stay afloat.  “The classic generative PFP NFT mint model is a lottery that normally provides the opportunity to profit immediately by flipping unrevealed mints due to oversubscription as people speculate on the chance of pulling a rare [trait],” said Fang. “When collections over increase the supply or use auction models, they eliminate this speculative opportunity in exchange for maximum extraction, harming their own audience's ability to profit.”  Azuki later admitted that it “missed the mark.”  “Our goal for Elementals is to grow the Garden, welcome new members into the community, and most importantly to expand the Azuki universe and set a foundation for a decentralized IP with deep lore,” the Azuki team said. “However, our ambitious goals led to a new collection which confused the community on the tangible differences with the original Azuki collection.”  The brand has since airdropped new NFTs called “Green Beans” to select collectors.  As PFP collections fight for dominance in a changing NFT landscape, it is important for creators to find solutions that deliver value back to their communities. Still, it appears that even shaky mints have the ability to pump much-needed movement into the NFT market.  According to data from Dune Analytics researcher SeaLaunch, Tuesday’s aggregated NFT marketplace trading volume surpassed 35,000 ETH, or just over $64 million at the time of writing – the biggest volume day since early March.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/06/28/azuki-elementals-mint-mishap-highlights-the-fragile-state-of-the-nft-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e03ca3c307c6e1e913cdcc55c7f361a94fa5ff57-1280x800.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42393245,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgjVcT,1687996017,Binance's Euro Banking Partner to Halt Support of the Crypto Exchange in September,"Binance’s euros banking partner, Paysafe Payment Solutions, will stop supporting the crypto exchange after Sept. 25.  “Binance will be changing the provider for EUR deposits and withdrawals via Bank Transfer (SEPA). Our current partner, Paysafe, will no longer be providing these services to Binance users from 25th September 2023,” a spokesperson for the exchange told CoinDesk in an email.  “At that time, our users will need to update the banking details used to deposit to their Binance accounts and may be required to accept new terms and conditions to continue using SEPA services after this date.”  SEPA, short for Single Euro Payments Area, is the European Union’s integrated, cross-border payment network for euro transactions.  ""Following a strategic review, we have taken the decision to cease offering our embedded wallet solution to Binance across the region,"" Paysafe said in an email. ""We are already in the process of withdrawing the service in the UK.""  The development comes as Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, has faced backlash from financial regulators in Europe and the U.S.  Earlier this month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Binance, Binance.US and CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao for violating multiple federal securities laws, including allegations of offering unregistered securities and commingling customer funds.  Since then, the exchange has announced a retreat from the Netherlands and Cyprus, requested to cancel permissions in the U.K., while Belgium’s market watchdog ordered it to stop offering crypto services in the country.  In February 2022, U.K’s financial regulator expressed concern over Binance gaining access to the country's primary payments network after the exchange secured the Paysafe deal, the Financial Times reported.

14299428,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4614229-bitcoins-dubious-rally?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1687995917,Bitcoin's Dubious Rally,"Summary Don’t get FOMO from rising Bitcoin prices – short-term indicators are worrisome. It’s uncertain that the November 2022 Bitcoin-bottom will be the Bear Bottom. Bitcoin is entering a seasonally weak period – thus, this rally is dubious. Large holders of Bitcoin have been selling into Bitcoin’s strength. The Fed’s reducing liquidity by refilling its TGA wallet and raising rates – pressuring Bitcoin. However, the long-term case for Bitcoin remains stronger than ever! Thesis Bitcoin (BTC-USD) remains in a bear market in my opinion. Patience is a virtue – we must wait for apathy to become the narrative before a true market bottom is reached. For now, I see a host of negatives including weak seasonality, continued regulatory enforcement actions, competition from governmental CBDCs, rising Bitcoin Dominance, distribution by larger holders, greedy sentiment, negative Technicals (i.e., chart), tightening Fed liquidity, lackluster fund flows and negative On-Chain Metrics. While Bitcoin is in a danger zone, the long-term case for Bitcoin remains stronger than ever! The U.S. (and other governments) continues to print more dollars and debase the currency and Bitcoin addresses (i.e., adoption) continues to rise. Further, the approaching Halving Cycle and related strong Tokenomics favor higher prices. Introduction I first heard of Bitcoin back in 2017 when my younger colleagues became obsessed with its price (but nothing else). I was working at a bank at the time, so I didn’t have much time to devote to this “rabbit hole.” I took an intellectual short-cut figuring, after little thought, that Bitcoin was a digital coin with little intrinsic value. Six years deep into that rabbit hole, I can see that it’s more than that, though I respect some of the brightest minds such as Nassim Nicholas Taleb that can’t get past Bitcoin’s “culty-ness.” Where are we now? Bitcoin and the crypto market overall rebounded wildly from the bottom post the FTX (FTT-USD) fraud in November 2022. At that time, Bitcoin plunged from over $21k to approximately $15.5k. While I believe it’s too early for Bitcoin to become uncorrelated to equities, it showed remarkable resilience during the Silvergate/Silicon Valley bank runs and continued to rise to the present-day low $30s. Was November 2022 the Bear Market Bottom? I was very torn during Bitcoin’s November bottom. I follow a multitude of indicators and nearly ALL of them were saying this was it – “ We are at rock bottom .” However, I told my YouTube channel subscribers that this may NOT be the bottom because I was still expecting the Federal Reserve to remain hawkish. Remember, for the time being Bitcoin is Macro and Macro is Bitcoin, meaning that it’s very sensitive to liquidity. Short-term Indicators are Bearish I’m certified as a Financial Risk Manager and believe managing risk is a vital success factor if one wants to live through bear markets. As such, I would rather err on the side of caution. I still think Bitcoin could fall, even if it would be like a dancer that’s crouching down before a large jump, as famed trader and dancer Nicolas Darvas once said. Below is a list of red flags for Bitcoin: Sell in May and Go Away As the saying goes, risk assets tend to decline during the summer months, so why take undo risk? Deutsche Digital Assets Regulatory Enforcement Regulators, particularly Gary Gensler’s SEC, have regulated via enforcement. The SEC has sued crypto related firms over 17 times this year, under what’s called Operation Chokepoint 2.0, (which has been described as a well-coordinated effort to marginalize the blockchain industry and cut-off connections to the banking industry). Operation Chokepoint 2.0 became popularized following a post from venture capitalist Nic Carter. Bitcoin is seen as a threat to the U.S. government’s control of money (and sanctioning power) and a threat to the US Dollar’s reserve currency status. As most readers know, the SEC has recently sued Coinbase (COIN) and Binance (BNB-USD) and has said that all crypto assets are securities. The only exceptions may be Bitcoin and stablecoins. However, on February 2023, the SEC informed Paxos Trust that it was intending to sue them as it considered the Binance USD stablecoin an “unregistered security.” (see the next bullet for additional info on stablecoins). These lawsuits reduce money flows into all digital assets including Bitcoin. While some flows are going into Bitcoin as a “safe haven” this is not sustainable. Cointelegraph Negative Fund Flows Speaking of flows, the constant regulatory restrictions and lack of crypto regulation (“rules of the road”) from Congress, has resulted in lower flows going into all digital assets. Note that fund flows tend to vary widely on a week-to-week basis, so it’s better to examine them during a multi-month period ( CoinShares provides excellent weekly flow data for those that would like to follow this). I don’t expect institutional flows until at least 2025 when/if there’s regulatory clarity. Lower flows reduce trading liquidity, and as the saying goes, “escalator up – elevator down.” Deutsche Digital Assets Stablecoins & Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) There are also some headline and regulatory risks relating to upcoming regulations on stablecoins. I recently spoke to Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (Democrat-NY) who expects her upcoming digital asset bill to specifically highlight stablecoins. Stablecoins have been described as the “backbone” that allows Defi and non-custodial (i.e., DEX) trading, according to Coin Bureau. Without them, Bitcoin’s liquidity would dry up. Further, stablecoins and Bitcoin are a threat to the US dollar, hence central banks are expecting to introduce their own versions (i.e., CBDCs). The above is both a short-term and long-term risk. CryptoQuant Bitcoin Dominance is rising Bitcoin’s market cap, or Bitcoin + Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), as a percentage of total digital asset market cap, typically grows during bear markets. Note that some blockchain analysts are now grouping Ether with Bitcoin as it’s considered a safe-haven given that the SEC’s Hinman and the CFTC stated it’s not a security . Historically, Altcoins bleed against Bitcoin in bear markets – we’re witnessing this now. In just the last three-months, Bitcoin + Eth dominance rose from 65% to 69%. BTC Tools Large Holders of Bitcoin have stopped accumulating There are different cohorts of Bitcoin holders depending on how large their bags are. The largest, of course, are known as whales. Glassnode tranches them according to six cohorts. During the April-May rally, only the smallest of holders accumulated, the rest (sharks, dolphins, whales...) have been selling aggressively. Typically, small (i.e., retail “weak hands”) investors buy at the top and sell at the bottom. The red squares represent selling, which is occurring amongst most cohorts now, with the exception of the largest holders (> 10k bitcoin) which are neutral. The best time to DCA into Bitcoin is when the squares are blue (accumulation) as occurred post-FTX. Glassnode Tightening Liquidity via the Fed TGA I believe that liquidity has been the primary factor affecting ALL risk assets since 2008. It’s no wonder that Bitcoin and NASDAQ’s artificial intelligence tech stocks have risen recently, as liquidity rose when the Federal Reserve tried to avert the March 2023 bank runs . However, now that the Fed’s slapped a bandage on the Regional Banking Crises and Congress has averted a debt ceiling , the Fed needs to refill its Treasury General Account (TGA). This refilling could drain nearly $0.7 trillion in liquidity. Consequently, I think Bitcoin and Tech are at risk. The rising blue line in the chart below represents the “refilling of the TGA wallet”. The more it rises, the tighter is liquidity. The green line represents the NASDAQ 100 Index (Left hand side axis). St. Louis Fed I believe what we’re seeing in both equities and cryptocurrencies is a LIMITED supply of money chasing a few assets – in this case tech stocks and Bitcoin. While Bitcoin has reached a new yearly high, the total Altcoin market has not. Again, this rally is dubious. Declining Fed Balance Sheet The Federal Reserve’s resumed its program of Quantitative Tightening. This is already being reflected in the chart below where you can see the decline in Total Assets (i.e., Balance Sheet) as shown in the purple line (Right hand axis). One can see how vigorously (albeit delayed) that Bitcoin prices (black line) reacted to the initial rising balance sheet and then declined as the Fed rolled-off its portfolio. St. Louis Fed Sentiment has gotten too frothy I use sentiment as a contrary indicator both for equities and Bitcoin. The excitement over Blackrock’s (WisdomTree, Fidelity) ETF application has started to make people giddy. The BTC Tools Fear & Greed Index has turned Greedy. This is often the best time to sell , not buy. BTC Tools Derivative Positioning (Options + Futures) There are several ways to determine sentiment based on the Futures and Options markets. I interpret these from a contrarian point of view. So if everyone is buying relatively more Calls and fewer Puts, that would be a negative reading. While the current Futures market seems negative to neutral, the options market is telling a different story. Traders have been buying call options on Bitcoin (and NASDAQ tech stocks) fairly aggressively. The chart below shows open interest for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin’s Put/Call ratio is trading near its lower-end of the three-year range. The Block On-Chain Metrics I keep track of a dozen metrics and most of them became very bullish at Bitcoin’s Nov/Dec 2022 bottom. However, all of them have moved from Bullish to Neutral at best. The Puell Multiple (which is the daily value of Bitcoin Miner coin issuance divided by its Yearly Average) for example, moved from just 0.36x on December 2022 to over 1.2x during the last three months. For perspective, Bitcoin was trading below $18k when the Puell was 0.36x and around $55k the last time the Puell traded at today’s level. Scary, no?! CryptoQuant Weak Bitcoin Technicals The way Bitcoin has traded over the last year leaves it vulnerable to high selling pressure above $30k given that there’s huge resistance in this area (See chart). It is also trading against its upper Bollinger Band. TradingView So why am I so Bullish long term? I will delve into details of my long-term bullishness, one Satoshi at a time, in an upcoming SA article. In summary, these positives include Bitcoin’s resistance to the debasement of the US dollar, attempts by the BRICS countries to destabilize the USD as reserve currency (chart below) and positive on-chain-metrics such as rising addresses (aka the “Network Effect”). There is even more than a remote chance that the U.S. could support Bitcoin. Recently, the International Monetary Fund (which is controlled by the U.S.) capitulated on Bitcoin bans saying, “ banning may not be effective in the long run .” So there is hope! Wolf Street , IMF Lastly, I will discuss Bitcoin’s excellent Tokenomics, which is characterized by a limited supply (21 million Bitcoin), high circulating supply (19.4 million), the upcoming halving cycle (chart below) large amount of inactive supply and lost coins. Glassnode I’ve noticed the media is giving very little airtime to lost coins. These could be Bitcoin wallets that are lost, coins sent to wrong addresses, hard-drive failures, wallet failures, lost seed phrases, or people dying without plans. James Mullarney has estimated lost coins to be between 3-6 million Bitcoin and he says that it could amount to 4% yearly. If such is the case, Bitcoin has ALREADY become deflationary. Below are the returns of Bitcoin one year after each halving (aka Epoch). The last halving was in May 2020 and the next is expected around April/May 2024. Note that the next halving will likely occur in a period of falling supply. Glassnode Conclusion As you can see from the multitude of indicators and fundamentals, Bitcoin seems to be trading at a short-term top. Readers may find it surprising that I’m bullish on Bitcoin given the (perhaps) convincing case I’ve made. Bitcoin’s long-term case remains stronger than ever. Like Nicolas Darvas once said, I think the short-term decline will be more like a dancer’s crouching down before she rises for a big jump.

The Origin Of The Claims A rumor started circulating on Twitter on Thursday that the Sui Foundation was unlocking and dumping locked staking rewards on Binance. According to a Twitter thread by @DefiSquared, a popular crypto trader and commentator, “locked” and “non-circulating” staked SUI were manipulated by the foundation.

DefiSquared also goes on to provide on-chain data showing how millions of SUI rewards were transferred. These tokens were split many times, with most of them ending on Binance. An example was a transfer of 2,500,000 SUI rewards from 0x341f to 0x209f on May 31st. However, The Sui Foundation has since referred to the transaction as a payment subject to a contractual lockup.

14298246,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=540241,1687993071,Bitcoin Reaches Longest Stretch Ever Without A Bull Run,"Bitcoin is known for its explosive price movements — both bullish and bearish. However, Relative Strength Index data suggests the top cryptocurrency by market cap has gone the longest stretch ever without a bullish impulse. Just how long has it been since the last time BTCUSD was fully bullish? And how does this data compare to past bear markets? Reliving The Thrill Of Past Bitcoin Bull Markets Bitcoin price is retesting $30,000 per coin and bulls are hoping it holds. If it does, yet another higher high could provide further confirmation to onlookers that an uptrend is forming. By definition, an uptrend is a series of higher highs and higher lows — precisely the pattern in BTCUSD since the November 2022 low. But despite this pattern, the crypto market has yet to see a true bull run. Related Reading: Bitcoin Starts To Bite Back Says Reptilian Technical Signal The last major bull market began in late 2020. Prior to that, Bitcoin had a short-lived, 300% rally in 2019. Two years before that in 2017, Bitcoin spent the entire year in a bullish market. This time around, a true bullish impulse is nowhere in sight, and barely in the rear view mirror at this point. It’s been so long since the last bull run, it has now reached the longest stretch ever according to the Relative Strength Index. It’s been a long time since bulls had a turn | BTCUSD on TradingView.com Why The Stampede Is Waiting For An Overbought RSI The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum measuring tool, which tells an investor if the asset is overbought or oversold. Unlike other assets, the speculative nature of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies causes them to remain overbought for longer than normal. When this occurs, FOMO fuels a fast and furious price movement higher. Using overbought RSI signals on the weekly BTCUSD chart as a gauge of impulsive behavior, the crypto market has been without a bull market for 973 days.

The bull run that followed made Bitcoin a household name and put crypto on the map. Could such a lengthy period of pain and suffering ultimately lead to another epic price increase? For that to happen, BTCUSD must first reach overbought levels on the one week RSI. But considering how long it has been, time is likely ticking away for bears.

14297643,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=540212,1687991695,Bitcoin Poised For Potential Major Buy Signal In July,"Spurred by the recent flood of spot Bitcoin ETF applications from Blackrock and Fidelity among others, Bitcoin vaulted impressively up to the $30,000 area where its momentum has stalled in recent sessions. While many analysts and traders routinely acknowledge the significance of the $30,000 level as a key resistance area, Bitcoin’s move back above its 20-month simple moving average (20-month SMA) may deserve far more attention than it’s getting. With Bitcoin poised for a potential major buy signal as soon as July 1st, let’s take a closer look at this underappreciated signal. The Simple Line Separating Bull And Bear Phases Bitcoin’s 20-month SMA currently sits at $29,910 according to the Bitcoin / U.S. Dollar All Time History Index, slightly below Bitcoin’s current price of just above $30,000. This puts the number one cryptocurrency by market cap barely above its 20-month SMA for the first time since March 2022. What’s the potential significance? If Bitcoin can end the month of June with a monthly candle close above the 20-month SMA, this will be only the fifth time that this has occurred in all of Bitcoin’s history, and a signal which has often seen higher prices follow. Bitcoin Monthly Chart with 20-Month SMA | BTCUSD on TradingView.com Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Stalls As Short-Term Holder Exchange Inflows Intensify For a clearer picture of the significance of the 20-month SMA, let’s look at all of Bitcoin’s monthly closes above the 20-month SMA and below the 20-month SMA. In order to do this, we’ll create a hypothetical trading system, strictly for analytical purposes, “buying” when Bitcoin closes above its 20-month SMA and “selling” when Bitcoin closes back below its 20-month SMA. Note that “LE” indicates a buy signal while “LX” indicates a sell signal. The blue highlight shows the periods when the system’s logic sold Bitcoin following a long exit signal and was out of the market. Bitcoin Monthly Chart with 20-Month SMA | BTCUSD on TradingView.com What’s striking in this chart is that 20-month SMA nearly perfectly divides bull phases from bear phases throughout most of Bitcoin’s history from late 2011 to now. For example, exiting once Bitcoin closes below its 20-month SMA sidesteps much of the 2014-2015 bear market, the worst leg down of the 2018-2019 bear market, and so far virtually all of the current 2022-2023 bear market. The early pandemic drop in March of 2020 provides the only exception, with the simple logic getting briefly whipsawed before re-entering at the start of the next month. Bitcoin’s 20-Month SMA Stats Look Compellingly Bullish Taking our research a step further, let’s quantify the signals, once again hypothetically “buying” when Bitcoin closes above its 20-month SMA and “selling” when Bitcoin closes back below its 20-month SMA. From late 2011 to the present, there have been four completed signals with a profitability of 75%, meaning three of the four signals produced a hypothetical gain, and one of the signals produced a loss. Over these four signals, Bitcoin delivered an impressive +2499% hypothetical average trade versus a single worst trade result of -24.8%. While clearly occurrences of these infrequent signals are low (only four to date, and too few to be statistically significant) and the past does not predict the future, we’ll nevertheless be watching closely to see if Bitcoin can end June with a monthly close above its 20-month SMA. At the moment, sitting just above the key $30,000 level, Bitcoin looks poised for a potential major buy signal in July. DB the Quant is the author of the REKTelligence Report newsletter on Substack.

SOL remains below a significant resistance level that the bulls have struggled to overcome for several weeks. Related Reading: Bitcoin Correlation To Gold, Silver Drops To Cyclical Lows: Glassnode On the daily chart, SOL has depreciated by 1.4%. On the weekly chart, the price has slightly declined by just over 2%. The technical outlook appears grim, with limited buying strength indicated by falling demand and accumulation on the daily chart. Solana may require the support of a Bitcoin rally above the $31,000 mark to break past the overhead resistance. This has to be coupled with strength in the broader market. The participation of buyers will be crucial for SOL’s upward momentum. However, if SOL fails to surpass the immediate ceiling in the upcoming trading sessions, the extended consolidation phase could lead to a price decline. Additionally, the recent decline in market capitalization within the last 24 hours is considered a bearish sign for the altcoin. Solana Price Analysis: One-Day Chart After facing rejection at $17.30, SOL currently trades at $16.30. The coin is encountering overhead resistance at $17. A breakthrough above this level could pave the way for a rally toward $18. Although SOL is currently stuck below the resistance, there may be potential buying opportunities for traders shortly. If consolidation persists, SOL can lose its current price level and decline to $16. Subsequently, it may drop to $15.60, which has served as a Point Of Control (POC) indicated by the red line. The POC represents a significant trading volume, suggesting that it could present a favorable buying opportunity as the coin has historically tended to recover from that point. Technical Analysis Since failing to surpass the $17 mark, SOL has experienced persistently low buying strength. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has made attempts at recovery, but crossing the 50-mark has proven challenging. As a result, sellers have maintained control of the market. Furthermore, SOL has fallen below the 20-Simple Moving Average, indicating increased downward price action as sellers drove the price momentum. Based on its daily chart, there are promising signs of potential gains for the altcoin. The Moving Average Convergence indicator shows buy signals, as indicated by the formation of green histograms. This suggests a shift in momentum. Related Reading: Cardano Set To Be Delisted On Huobi – Will It Dent ADA Price? Additionally, the Bollinger Bands, which measure price volatility, have converged, indicating that the price is currently constricted. However, this might also imply the possibility of a breakout.

The year-to-date spread in performance between the SCPX (47.16%), and the 81% gain in the bitcoin heavy CoinDesk Currency Select index (CCYS), may represent an opportunity dressed as underperformance. Stablecoin movement into smart contracts may indicate when it may occur.  The SCPX, aggregates the performance of seven digital assets within the smart contract platform sector. Ether represents 82.5% of the index, while the remaining six assets compose the remaining 17.5%.  The index itself is up 43% year-to-date versus a 55% increase in ETH. This discrepancy stems from weaker performance from remaining constituents (ADA, MATIC, SOL, DOT, AVAX, ATOM).  Still, with BTC and ETH maintaining a correlation coefficient of 0.92, the strong pricing relationship implies that performance disparities may narrow over time.  The recent flurry of activity surrounding the potential approval of a spot bitcoin ETF has boosted BTC relative to other digital assets, and understandably. BTC has improved 13% versus ETH since June 6. ETH as an individual asset has risen 3% over the same time period.  Removal of BTC from the CCYS results in the SCPX outperforming the currency select index by close to 4%  Tracking Stablecoins  While bitcoin receives most attention specific to stablecoin flows, stablecoins themselves may hint at where smart contract platforms are headed.. Stablecoin movement on to exchanges often indicates BTC buying – an exchange of one store of value for another.  Stablecoin movement on to smart contract platforms may also foreshadow smart platforms’ path forward, although a more apt description may be an exchange of value for utility. According to on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the stablecoin supply on smart contract platforms is in a prolonged decline that began in March.  The metric tallies the balances of USDT, USDC, BUSD, and DAI, showing their separate and aggregate impacts. Stablecoin supply increases indicate growing demand for smart contracts usage, which would be bullish for assets with the SCPX. Lessening supply would indicate the opposite.  USDT composes the largest share of stablecoins on smart contract platforms after having passed USDC in May.  SCPX strength, despite the reduced stablecoin supply, underscores the resilience of ETH, despite its underperformance compared to BTC.  Investors who remain bullish on smart contract platforms may be looking for an uptick in stablecoin supplies as a signal of improved sentiment that would affect ETH as well as the remaining assets within the SCPX. This may hold especially true for those with longer investment time horizons, and who have the ability to accumulate positions in SCPX assets, while BTC remains on center stage.

Binance began experiencing regulatory troubles on June 5, when the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against the exchange on the allegations of fraud and offering of unregistered securities, among others, and this has affected the performance of the cryptocurrency. BNB Loses $10 Billion In Market Cap Following the news of the SEC’s charges against Binance, its native cryptocurrency BNB, whose market value is tied to the broader performance of the trading platform, saw its market cap drop by 8%, shedding over $4 billion in a single day. Related Reading: Bitcoin Correlation To Gold, Silver Drops To Cyclical Lows: Glassnode Asides from its struggles on US soil, Binance’s operations have also suffered some regulatory setbacks in parts of Europe in the last few weeks. On June 17, the exchange announced the shutdown of its market in the Netherlands due to the inability to obtain a virtual asset service provider (VASP) from the Dutch authorities. Furthermore, French authorities commenced an investigation into Binance France on the basis of alleged money laundering and illegal canvassing of clients. Belgium became the latest country to join this growing list of disgruntled nations after its Financial Services and Markets Authorities (FSMA) issued an order directing Binance to cease its operations in the country immediately. Over the last 30 days, all these events have culminated in BNB losing over $12 billion in market shares, representing a staggering 25% decline in the token’s market cap. Moreover, the Binance Coin has also seen its market price fall from $316.56 to trade as low as $223.88 during this period. Although BNB did experience some resurgence in the general market uptrend that occurred last week, it has proven insignificant in turning around the token’s fortunes. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the coin is exchanging hands at $234.11, with a 2.25% decline in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, the token market cap now stands at $36 billion, retaining its position as the fourth biggest cryptocurrency in the market. BNB Market Cap Valued At $36.17 Billion On The 1-Minute Chart | Source: BNB Chart On Tradingview.com What Next For The Cryptocurrency? Following BNB’s recent negative price movements coupled with its status in the crypto space, there are bound to be high levels of speculation on the token’s next movements. According to price prediction site Coincodex, investors’ sentiments surrounding BNB remain bearish, reflecting the present concerns over the token’s fate amidst Binance growing regulatory troubles. Related Reading: Whale Trades LINK And BNB For PEPE And ETH In High-Value Transaction Coincodex is predicting BNB to maintain its bearish trend, for now, to trade at $226.88 in 5 days, representing a 2.43% gain on the current market price.

BTC's price fell to as low as $29,874, a 1.8% decline over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk Indices data. The token has pared some of the losses later, and was trading slightly above $30,000.  Still, the decline led to a sudden sell-off in altcoin – short for alternative cryptocurrencies – markets, which suffered 5-10% drops from Tuesday, same time.  The Optimism network's OP token recently fell 10%, while Cardano's ADA, Polygon's MATIC and Avalanche's AVAX suffered the largest falloffs among the top 20 cryptocurrencies, losing 6%, 7.7% and 8%, respectively.  Ether (ETH), the token with the second largest market cap, held up better than most altcoins but underperformed BTC, sliding 3.2%.  Altcoins' underperformance extended BTC's grip over the broader digital asset market. The BTC dominance rate, which shows the largest cryptocurrency's share in the total market, soared above the 52% level for the first time since April 2021, according to TradingView data.  The recent frenzy of institutional investment activity, underscored by traditional finance heavyweight BlackRock and other asset management firms filing for a sought-after spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF), lifted the price of BTC to a one-year high this month.  Meanwhile, regulatory risks weighed on the performance of smaller cryptocurrencies.

The company’s former CEO, Michael Saylor, has been a vocal advocate for BTC, frequently extolling its virtues as a store of value and an inflation hedge. Related Reading: Cardano Set To Be Delisted On Huobi – Will It Dent ADA Price? MicroStrategy’s initial purchase of Bitcoin in August 2020 was seen as a bold move, given the cryptocurrency’s reputation for volatility. However, the company’s investment has paid off handsomely, with the value of its Bitcoin holdings more than doubling in value since its initial purchase. MicroStrategy’s latest BTC purchase, while significant, is not the first time the company has added to its holdings. In fact, the company has been on a buying spree, having purchased over 100,000 Bitcoin since August 2020. This has made MicroStrategy one of the largest holders of Bitcoin in the world. Nevertheless, the company’s decision to invest so heavily in BTC has not been without criticism. Some experts have questioned the wisdom of investing such a large amount of capital into a single asset, particularly one as volatile as Bitcoin. Others have expressed concern over the potential regulatory risks that come with holding such a large amount of cryptocurrency. Despite these concerns, Michael Saylor remains bullish on Bitcoin and continues to advocate for its adoption as a mainstream asset. He has even gone so far as to offer BTC as a form of compensation to MicroStrategy’s board of directors, demonstrating his commitment to the cryptocurrency’s long-term prospects. Related Reading: Whale Trades LINK And BNB For PEPE And ETH In High-Value Transaction Overall, MicroStrategy’s investment in BTC represents a significant shift in the way that traditional companies view cryptocurrencies. While some may view the company’s actions as risky or imprudent, others see it as a bold and visionary move that could pay off handsomely in the long run. Only time will tell which of these viewpoints proves to be correct. At present, Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, has been experiencing a decline in value but has managed to maintain the $30,000 threshold.

The top crypto slipped 1.8% to $30.1K at 3:28 p.m. ET, after twice testing the $30K psychological support level earlier in the session. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), the largest altcoin by market cap, edged down 2.9% to $1.84K. The pullbacks coincided with some risk-off action in the stock market, although the tech-heavy Nasdaq was slightly in the green. Wall Street titans BlackRock ( BLK ), Invesco ( IVZ ) and WisdomTree ( WT ) all have filed an application this month for an ETF based on the underlying bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) token. Some have suggested that approval of such a product has the potential to drive increased crypto-market inflows given the size and scale of BLK, in particular. ""One crucial benefit of investing in spot Bitcoin ETF is that it becomes very easy for stock buyers to invest in ETFs,"" said Didar Bekbauov, founder and CEO of bitcoin group mining company Xive, adding that ""investors do not have to think about how to store cryptocurrencies."" Fidelity Investments, with $4.5T in assets under management, was the latest institutional player to join the spot bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ETF race, as a Tuesday report noted that it's preparing to submit an application for the product.

42420036,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUWcQP,1687980339,Popular Standard for Issuing Tokenized Securities Gets Makeover,"When issuers of tokenized securities need guardrails around who can hold their tokens and where to send them, a four year-old Ethereum smart-contract framework called ERC-1404 comes into play.  That popular standard is now getting an upgrade.  Advisory firm Republic Crypto and token builder Upside have put together an enhanced version called ERC-1404 Prime that the two companies are betting on as a new foundation for issuing regulatorily compliant assets on the Ethereum blockchain.  The guardrails can be especially important for cryptos representing stock shares, real estate and other assets subject to complex investor rules. Issuers of these “security tokens” use ERC-1404 to ensure they don’t run afoul of the law by, for example, keep the tokens from getting transferred to investors who aren’t accredited or authorized.  Republic Head of Tokenization Jeff Vier said ERC-1404 Prime allows for more complex transfer restriction scenarios than the original standard. He said it prepares tokens for a world where centralized and decentralized finance might coalesce, perhaps through peer-to-peer swaps, which are a hallmark of decentralized exchanges.  “How do we improve for today with what regulators are looking for, what the industry is looking for, and also setting ourselves up to design assets that can exist in a future state?” he said. “That’s the way we're thinking about this.”  The new design can help tokens get to the secondary market faster, he said.  The enhanced version incorporates lessons learned in the four years since Tokensoft debuted ERC-1404, said Noah Thorp, CEO of Upside, a token issuance firm. Prime can handle automated lock-ups and dividend distributions, two features the original could not.  The original version of ERC-1404 takes the “simplest implementation possible that meets the regulatory requirements, Tokensoft CEO Mason Borda told CoinDesk.  “To date, we’re the only ones that have gotten SEC-registered tokens through the SEC on a public blockchain,” he said, referring to a treasuries-linked product on Ethereum.

It is a blockchain platform that enables the development of innovative DeFi applications. XRD, Radix’s native token, is one of the worst performers in the market today, recording an 11% loss in the past 24 hours. However, it is worth noting that the general altcoin market is in red today, as most assets are currently in a slight decline. Radix Experiences Recorrection Following Recent Price Rally The price performance of Radix has been largely positive in 2023. In April, the XRD token reached its yearly peak – so far – at $0.139530.

The General Altcoin Market Suffers Slight Decline The Radix token is not the only altcoin experiencing a price dip at the moment. Generally, the altcoin market is currently on a decline, with most tokens registering slight losses in the past 24 hours. BNB, for example, has lost 3.2% of its value in the past day.

42420042,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUWcVZ,1687978036,Blockchain May Offer Answers for AI Challenges,"ChatGPT is the fastest growing consumer application of all time, according to research by banking giant UBS. This growth underscores the profound impact that artificial intelligence (“AI”) and related technologies (i.e. large language models, machine learning, and natural language processing) have already had on society. But like any promising new technology, AI also has the potential to harm. Could blockchain help meet some of these challenges? Here are three key areas where blockchain and artificial intelligence intersect:     Source: World of Statistics  Verification and identity: Generative AI significantly lowers the barrier to content creation but also instigates a flood of misinformation and deepfakes. Establishing consensus on the authenticity of information is at the core of blockchain technology. For instance, a unique digital signature could be created for each piece of digital content and recorded on a blockchain, allowing anyone to verify the content's authenticity.  Data privacy and ownership: Companies like Google, Facebook, and 23andme derive significant income from monetizing various forms of user data. It’s feasible that powerful AI systems could follow suit as consumer applications increase in popularity. Projects like the Brave browser demonstrate how blockchain could combat this trend by enabling individuals to maintain sovereign ownership over their personal data in a privacy-preserving manner as well as decide how and when it is shared and monetized.  Centralization risk: AI's capital-intensive nature and tendency toward network effects could centralize power among an oligopoly, limiting alternative options for users. Crypto can democratize AI development by offering decentralized data and computation marketplaces. By incentivizing user participation through tokens, crypto could counterbalance AI-induced centralization.  Progress: The Intersection of Crypto and AI Today  While the convergence of crypto and AI is in its infancy, it has already garnered significant investor interest. So far in 2023, venture capitalists have invested $422 million specifically in crypto applications related to AI, privacy and identity. Notable raises include Worldcoin, a verification and identity-based protocol that raised $115 million in a Series C round, and Auradine, an AI and privacy-focused web3 infrastructure solution that secured $81 million in Series A funding.  Co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Worldcoin’s blockchain-based ""proof of humanity"" system uses retinal scans to authenticate human users. The company's long-term vision is to combat the increasing presence of bots online and mitigate potential AI-related wealth inequality. So far, it has attracted 1.8 million sign-ups from dozens of countries.  Conclusion  Driven by technologies like ChatGPT, AI is influencing society at a mass scale. Since ChatGPT reached the landmark of 100 million sign-ups in January 2023, $5.4 billion has been invested in AI startups worldwide which may lead to additional advancements in the technology.  As AI systems develop, the accompanying challenges and solutions will also evolve, increasing the intersection and synergies between crypto and AI.

Enough time has gone by to observe certain trends and extrapolate from them.  Will bitcoin and other assets rise, fall or stay roughly in place? BTC is currently trading at about $30,500, after spurting last week. Ether is holding strong a little below $1,900. First, let’s consider the past.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  A healthy 6 months for most cryptos  Here are the first and second quarter performances for a half-dozen of the largest digital assets by market capitalization, the leading U.S. equity indexes and prominent crypto-based stocks:  Layer 1’s  TradFi Indices  Crypto Based Stocks  Note that Bitcoin and Ether – the cryptos with the largest values – Solana and crypto-based stocks have outperformed the indexes – no small achievement given stocks’ rise from 2022’s bear market – and that much of the digital asset market’s gains have occurred in the first quarter. A recent price spike following spot bitcoin filings by BlackRock and two other financial services powerhouses ensured bitcoin and other assets finished in positive territory for Q2.  Within CoinDesk Indices CMI sectors, Small Contract Platforms led the way in the second quarter, followed by the currency sector up 55.82% and 35.06%, respectively. The digitization and computing sectors lagged, falling 84.7% and 92.03% respectively.  CoinDesk’s Bitcoin and Ether Trend Indicators show that both assets are in a phase of significant uptrend, a result of recent price upswings stemming from the spot BTC ETF applications..  Correlations between BTC and Tradfi indices decoupled from fairly strong levels, to virtually no correlation. A notable decline occurred between bitcoin and the Nasdaq Composite, falling from a correlation coefficient of 0.85 on March 31, to 0.02 currently.  Correlations range between 1 and -1, with 1 indicating a direct pricing relationship, and the latter indicating an inverse one.  Quiet first, then a surge  The first 74 days of the second quarter were quiet. Between April 1 and June 5, BTC sank from $28,134 to 27,173, a 5% fall-off..  The more than two-month slump occurred amid fresh macroeconomic economic uncertainties, even as inflationary pressures continued to subside, and the FOMC increased interest rates by 25 basis points (bps). The most recent top line, 4% inflation rate is 50% lower than it was in June 2022. M2 money supply declined 2.5% since January, and the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet is 2.1% lower in 2023, both positive developments specific to inflation control.  But the action and resulting price activity accelerated, starting with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) suit against the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance, on June 5.  The SEC suits against Binance and Coinbase on June 6 sent prices down 7% over the ensuing 10 days as investors grew fretful that an increasingly prohibitive U.S. regulatory environment would weigh on crypto markets.  But then prices about-faced 20% following the spot BTC applications by BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, Invesco and WisdomTree (the latter two were re-filings). The sudden appearance of BlackRock with its $9.1 trillion in assets under management sets up a cage match between an organization that has a 575-1 record for its ETF applications against an SEC that has seemed increasingly anti-crypto.  BlackRock’s inclusion of a “surveillance-sharing agreement,” is likely key to ultimate approval, and investors seem similarly upbeat about the application’s prospects.  Yet BlackRock’s ETF success rate is no guarantee its bitcoin product will win approval. The SEC has rejected multiple applications from high-profile firms and seems fiercely committed to deem crypto a security and to rein in what the agency considers a lack of consumer protection..  For the record, the denied ETF application was in October 2014 when BlackRock filed an application for an ETF that would not require the daily disclosure of holdings. The firm seems determined to avoid such lack of transparency issues in its spot BTC filing.  But what should investors expect for the third quarter?  August decision on BlackRock’s application  Markets are tentatively expecting that the first opportunity for the SEC to approve, deny or extend its deliberations about the BlackRock’s offering will occur in August. Anything other than an approval would likely be bearish. A rejection would likely depress BTC prices.  A so-called extension of review would raise questions about a BlackRock approval. An extension would also follow the SEC’s pattern of delaying its decision only to ultimately reject an application when delaying was no longer an option. A rejection at any point would likely drag on prices.  Will altcoins return to Q1 form or retreat further?  The disparity in performance between BTC, ETH, and other layer 1 protocols has been striking. And while BTC and ETH have thus far avoided being labeled “securities” by the SEC, the same is not true for a number of altcoins.  In many ways, regulatory clarity from the SEC may ultimately be more pertinent to altcoins, than to BTC and ETH. A lack of it may lead to continued decoupling, as investors looking for crypto exposure stick with BTC and ETH.  Will macroeconomic narratives subside?  A year ago, inflation was above 9%. Today it sits at 4%. While still above the Fed’s 2% target, the speed of decline has changed the inflation narrative from “can it be managed” to “is it time to stop monetary hawkishness.”  Looking forward, economic data points which may take a larger portion of center stage, are employment, and the growth of consumer revolving credit, which would impact the amount of discretionary capital available for crypto assets.

The new version of Damus will no longer have zaps on posts – a configuration Apple reportedly considers equivalent to selling digital content – but will still allow users to send zaps to each other at the profile level.  Apple has come under fire from the Bitcoin community – among them former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey – with complaints that it’s impeding bitcoin adoption by imposing overly rigid guidelines when it comes to bitcoin-friendly applications on the App Store. The tech giant told CoinDesk it “reviews all apps against the same set of guidelines.”  Read more: Jack Dorsey Questions Apple's Tim Cook Over Bitcoin Support as Damus Deplatforming Looms  Some Damus supporters considered the approval a small win despite the compromise to restrict zaps to profiles.  “The most important thing is that the concept of zaps exists,” one user tweeted. “Medium term, it will revolutionize social media. Patience.”  Damus creator William Casarin previously told CoinDesk he found Apple’s review process frustrating, but the Canadian developer has already moved on to adding new features to his app after compromising with the tech giant.  “Damus v1.5 approved,” Casarin posted on the decentralized social media app late Tuesday. “Onward.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/06/28/damus-finally-receives-apple-app-store-approval-after-two-week-battle,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d391054520490a63d02c65fb008299cdc86189ed-1119x1197.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This abrupt decision introduces potential delays in addressing the remaining $2 billion deficit in FTX’s balance sheet, as the sale of the $500 million stake has been put on hold. Despite receiving interest from multiple parties interested in purchasing FTX’s stake, the advisory investment bank of FTX, Parella Weinberg Partners, has chosen to pause the sale of FTX’s stake in Anthropic this month. FTX stands to make a significant monetary recovery through the sale of its stake. A report by FTX restructuring chief John Ray on June 26 revealed that an estimated $8.7 billion in user funds had been misappropriated. Out of that, approximately $7 billion has already been successfully recovered. FTX’s ‘Clawback’ Impacted By Halt In Anthropic’s Sale In January, a federal judge presiding over the FTX bankruptcy case granted permission for FTX to proceed with the sale of certain assets in order to repay its creditors. At the time of FTX’s bankruptcy filing in November, the company held $500 million worth of Anthropic stock. Related Reading: Uniswap Bullish But Struggles With Resistance, Potential For More Gains? However, due to the ongoing AI boom, it is anticipated that the value of this stock has significantly increased since then. FTX has also divested itself of other assets. These included the derivatives trading platform LedgerX, which was sold for $50 million. This sale resulted in a significant loss compared to the $300 million that FTX initially paid for LedgerX in 2021. Selling Anthropic’s shares was part of its strategy to recover funds and allocate them toward repaying creditors. This process is commonly known as a “clawback.” Clawback refers to a legal procedure, and in the context of bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee, in FTX’s case Perella Weinberg Partners, seeks to recover property or payments made by the company prior to its filing for bankruptcy. In November, FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as a legal measure. Approximately a month later, FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried faced a series of federal charges. These charges included money laundering, fraud, and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. In recently filed court documents at the United States Bankruptcy Court of Delaware, FTX’s former leadership, including Sam Bankman-Fried, has been accused of commingling more than $402 million in customer funds. Allegedly, this action was carried out under the direction of Bankman-Fried and other senior FTX executives. Second Highest Stake Was In Anthropic At the time of FTX’s bankruptcy, its stake in the AI firm was one of the significant holdings. FTX’s stake in the AI ranked just behind its reported $1.15 billion investment in the cryptocurrency miner, Genesis Digital Assets. Anthropic, was founded in 2021 by former OpenAI employees. It made waves in the AI industry with the launch of its platform, Claude AI, in March. The company gained significant attention and support, securing a $400 million investment from Google earlier this year. During May, Anthropic secured $450 million in Series C funding. Spark Capital played a key role in leading the funding round, demonstrating their confidence in Anthropic’s vision and potential.

42420024,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUWcG5,1687974395,"Gary Gensler Failed the U.S. Crypto Industry, and So Has Congress","We are entering the summer of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The agency's latest actions against the world's foremost exchanges, Coinbase and Binance, have the crypto sector reeling.  Major players are making moves – quickly. Crypto.com announced it will wind down its U.S. institutional business due to “limited demand.” Robinhood testified last week in a House crypto hearing about the complete lack of help it received from the SEC in registering as a digital assets broker.  Dr. Paolo Tasca is a professor and economist at University College London, the founder of the DLT Science Foundation (DSF) and member of the blockchain technologies committee at the International Organization for Standardization. He advises several organizations and companies including Ripple, Hedera and INATBA.  This isn’t a full accounting of the SEC’s recent activities or crypto’s response – there is far more to explore. But the ringleader of the chaos is Gary Gensler, the current chairperson of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Robinhood, eToro and other major brokers have began delisting tokens from some of the most prominent blockchain projects in the space. Many of those projects happen to use proof-of-stake (PoS) algorithms, which guarantee high levels of network security, but have been called into question by SEC Chair Gary Gensler.  Suffice it to say, scrutiny is increasing.  The crypto sector has reason to wonder why Gensler is taking a hard stance on the cryptocurrency industry, especially compared to his predecessors. It is true, there are several problems in the crypto space. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reported victims lost more than $1 billion in cryptocurrency scams between January 2021 and March 2022. However, this statistic is nine times less than the losses incurred from security frauds in 2022, overall.  Gensler's focus leads me to believe he's following the ""nine over one"" rule – i.e., spending 90% of his time policing the crypto industry, a sector that accounts for just 10% of scams across the financial industry.  What kind of evidence and information is Gensler using to make his decisions? What can we expect from future SEC actions? Why has he changed his mind so much? And why is it that a government official is employing social media in a manner akin to a social media influencer, predominantly sharing content related to crypto while displaying personal satisfaction and emotional investment?  I was shocked when I recently rewatched an interview between Gensler and CoinDesk Managing Editor for Global Policy and Regulation Nikilesh De. He abruptly interrupted De, emphatically claiming three times in a row that all cryptocurrencies are securities. Shouldn't any government official, particularly the SEC chair, maintain impartiality, emotional detachment and fairness in carrying out their duties?  As speculation continues to rise, conspiracy theories about the SEC's true motives have also emerged on Twitter, Reddit and beyond. There are questions about Gensler's relationship with Sam Bankman-Fried. And reports that he was turned down for advisory roles at Binance. He doesn't have to be collaborating with SBF or operating out of spite to question the soundness of Gensler's thinking.  See also: Gary Gensler's Evolving Position on Crypto – in Quotes  The latest brouhaha (that is not really a brouhaha) is that the SEC is clearing the way for Prometheum and a handful of other firms, founded by regulatory insiders, to be the primary dealer for digital assets. Prometheum has a license to operate as an alternative trading system (ATS) that plans to list ""digital asset securities"" – but it's unlikely any cryptocurrencies will ever fit that regulatory designation.  Regulatory reality  Accusations that Gensler is a ""deep state"" agent hellbent on banning crypto, a criminal collaborator with SBF or an insider trading favors are fun to entertain, but they miss the point.  Gensler is not an irrational player. His actions make complete sense when you come to terms with the fact that he’s a long-term thinker who thinks he understands and, therefore, should be allowed to restrict an entire sector. He’s the worst kind of rational player: one who knows the rules (and where there are gaps). He’s used them to navigate himself into a powerful position on the board.  Lawmakers should show concern that Gensler is practically creating his own ""fourth"" branch of government by introducing a new bill for crypto regulation, bypassing the usual law-making process and standards like the Administrative Procedures Act. Whether legal or no, it is having an outsized effect.  Venture capital, founders and companies are fleeing the U.S. because of Gensler's actions. This will cost the U.S. economy billions of dollars. Until lawmakers decide which agency should oversee the crypto sector, there will continue to be hyper-rational players working on setting their precedent. For what motives, only time will tell.  It is beyond clear that the traditional regulatory frameworks do not fit Web3, blockchain and crypto and likely need to be updated. As a sector, we must continue to demand revolutionary approaches for effective regulation in these rapidly evolving markets. And as new bills are proposed, we must provide vocal commentary in whatever route is available.  We need to speak out against the assertion that all cryptocurrencies should be classified under securities. This is a simplistic interpretation, akin to saying an airplane is an automobile because they both go from ""point A to point B."" Although there are points of comparison that need to be determined, treating a cryptocurrency like security assets such as stocks or bonds in a new wrapper makes as much sense as calling an airplane a car with two wings and aptly encapsulates the flaws in our present classification system.  We require a comprehensive, well-structured taxonomy that aligns with these technological advancements and a modernized regulatory body proficient in handling the intricacies of these nascent markets. Perhaps, in response to the increasing technologization of the markets, a new fintech regulator should be established to better navigate the complexities of emerging digital technologies when it comes to financial consumers’ protection.  The blame can’t be laid just at Gensler’s feet, however. The issue fundamentally stems from a failure to recognize the transformative impact of blockchain technology on finance. Falling to come to consensus and pass legal frameworks that could have fostered a vibrant industry (and prevented many failures) will go down in history as a massive abnegation of duty.

Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Are Showing Elevated Exchange Inflows According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the short-term holders have recently made inflows equivalent to 1.28% of their entire supply. The “exchange inflow” here refers to an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin that investors are depositing to centralized exchanges currently. Generally, investors deposit to these platforms for selling-related purposes, so whenever this metric’s value is high, it’s a possible sign that there is dumping going on in the market. Naturally, this kind of trend can have bearish consequences for the cryptocurrency’s price. The exchange inflow is usually defined for the entire market, but in the context of the current discussion, the focus is only on the inflows being made by the “short-term holders” (STHs). The STHs make up one of the two major cohorts in the Bitcoin market (the other being the “long-term holders”), and they include all investors who have been holding their coins since less than 155 days ago. As their name already implies, these investors don’t tend to hold for too long, as they are usually the most fickle bunch in the market, easily selling at the sight of any FUD or profit-taking opportunities. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holders Expect Retrace, Will BTC Move Against Crowd Once Again? Now, below is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin exchange inflows specifically for the STHs over the last year or so. The value of the metric seems to have been quite high in recent days | Source: Glassnode on Twitter Here, the exchange inflow of the STHs is represented as a percentage of their supply (that is, the sum of the wallet amounts that each individual STH is holding right now). From the graph, it’s visible that the indicator’s value had risen to notable values earlier in the month when the market was going through FUD like the SEC lawsuits against cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and Coinbase. While the STHs were clearly showing panic then, the scale of their selling was still significantly lower than the other selloffs that have taken place during the past year. After the latest rally in the cryptocurrency’s price above the $30,000 level has occurred, however, the indicator’s value has shown a sharp increase. Now, the metric has hit a value of 1.28%, which means that the STHs have recently made inflows equivalent to 1.28% of their supply. Related Reading: Bitcoin Correlation To Gold, Silver Drops To Cyclical Lows: Glassnode This level is higher than what was seen during the rebound rally back in March of this year. As is visible from the graph, the rally back then had hit the brakes when the STHs ramped up their selling. So far, Bitcoin has been trending sideways since the recent sharp price surge occurred. So it’s possible that the current intensified selling from the STHs is behind this trend, similar to how it was back in March.

There have been a number of pilots and projects around the world involving different flavors of tokenized cash and associated applications, not to mention JPMorgan’s internal wholesale cash token, JPM Coin.  “What powers the global economy today is regulated money in the banks,” Dhamodharan said in an interview with CoinDesk. “So we’re starting with making tokenized bank deposits, so the unit of money in a bank account is a digital asset on the blockchain, bringing the same level of programmability to those as you find with digital currency in the crypto ecosystem.”  The first types of applications and use cases Mastercard intends to drive forward with tokenized bank money dovetails nicely with Mastercard Crypto Credentials, a blockchain analytics application announced in April, to ensure transactions are compliant with things like anti-money laundering (AML) regulations.  “Let’s say a bank in the UK has this tokenized form of bank deposit; and let's say another bank in Singapore also has a tokenized form of deposits,” Dhamodharan said. “You can see this being exchanged one for the other, also known as cross border transfer of value, which traditionally had a lot of issues in terms of being able to move in a fast and flexible way.”  An MTN Innovation Sprint, which will take place in London this summer, where selected teams will receive access to MTN’s capabilities to develop promising use cases powered by tokenized deposits and digital assets, Dhamodharan said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/06/28/mastercard-is-piloting-tokenized-bank-deposits-in-new-uk-testbed,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2c930795406170f9dc8b2b8a7465d5693780f9c9-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Litecoin and Chainlink have specifically grabbed a lot of attention with their upswing, but amidst all of the bullish momentum, another player is on the horizon known as Tradecurve, which is currently in the presale run and has been making waves with its potential for exponential growth. As a result, we decided to go to AI-driven tools like Google Bard to see what kind of outlook it has for all three cryptocurrencies. Summary Litecoin is expected to surge to $500 by the end of the year Chainlink can exceed investor expectations and can climb to $50 Tradecurve can climb in value by 100x, according to Google Bard Litecoin Seen as One of the Best Altcoins According to Google Bard Google Bard predicts a bullish pattern in the future of the Litecoin cryptocurrency. The key reasons why Google Bard believes Litecoin can grow in value include the increased adoption of LItecoin as a payment method, alongside more people buying LTC as a form of investment. Additionally, Google Bard noted how there is positive news surrounding the Litecoin cryptocurrency and a lot of speculation that can lead to sudden price movements. Litecoin is predicted to climb anywhere between $200 to $500, according to Google Bard, by the end of 2023. As of June 26, 2023, Litecoin traded at a value of $88.64. Within the last seven days, the cryptocurrency saw its low point of value at $76.29, while its high point was at a value of $92.50. The overall price increase in the last seven days has been at 14.6%, and in the last year, Litecoin surged by 48.7%. >>BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW The Bullish Future for Chainlink According to Google Bard Google Bard also had a bullish outlook for the Chainlink cryptocurrency, driven by its appeal in both investor circles and investors on a global scale. Positive news coverage surrounding the Chainlink cryptocurrency can fuel its growth alongside developments in its ecosystem. New features are consistently being rolled out, and 2023 has not been an exception to this growth. As a result, there is an estimation that Chainlink can climb between $25 to $50 by the end of the year. However, as of June 26, 2023, Chainlink trades at $6.17. During the past week, the low point for Chainlink was at $5.02, while the high point was at $6.34. The overall price increase in the last seven days for Chainlink was at 20.9%, indicating a bullish pattern. >>BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW Google Bard Estimates that Tradecurve Can Explode in Value Amidst this market rally, alongside Litecoin and Chainlink, another cryptocurrency grabbed attention from the market and grew by 80% since its beginning its Tradecurve, in the last week alone, it went up in value by 20%. Now, at Stage 4 of its presale, Tradecurve trades at $0.018, and at Stage 5 next week, it will climb by 40% to $0.025. This growth has been fueled due to the array of unique features and the promising roadmap it has. What helps Tradecurve stand out from competitors such as Binance and Kraken, according to Google Bard, is that it will not require any sign-up KYC checks, which will make it inclusive for anyone from anywhere in the world. KYC procedures can be time-consuming and can involve manual verification, delaying the account creation process and removing anonymity completely. Google Bard also noted how users can trade immediately just by making a deposit in crypto, which will be used as collateral on top of the platform. This fact, combined with the privacy provided by Tradecurve, will make it the most desirable trading platform for those who are conscious about their information and want to avoid it getting leaked from platforms that are heavily centralized. Other features behind Tradecurve that can help it grow in value, according to Google Bard, include high leverage starting at 500:1, a VIP account system, negative balance protection, and the implementation of Proof of Reserves (PoR) alongside Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) as a security measurement. So far, the team has raised $2.8 million, and 12,500 users have signed up. The team predicts that they will be able to raise $20 million and that they can onboard 100,000 users during the first three months of operation. According to Google Bard, due to all of these aspects, Tradecurve can climb to $1.8 by the end of Q4 2023.

However, there is evidence of increasing institutional adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) amid these challenging market conditions. Adoption Of Bitcoin Among Top Fintech Companies Prominent fintech companies have amassed substantial amounts of BTC over the past three years, as revealed by a recent report. Notably, Microstrategy’s BTC purchases amount to nearly $4 billion, despite the current BTC price being 55% lower than its all-time high (ATH). Other notable companies like Tesla, Block (formerly Square), and Galaxy Digital Holding have also demonstrated commitment to retaining their Bitcoin holdings despite the market’s inherent volatility. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Consolidates Below $31K As The Bulls Take Back Seat The report also highlights that certain regulatory uncertainties have hindered some top companies from adopting Bitcoin. But nevertheless, recent filings by renowned asset management firms indicate a positive sentiment towards this digital gold, reflecting a bullish momentum. CryptoQuant chart shows that the forthcoming wave of institutional adoption of BTC may not only benefit the companies themselves but also have a significant impact on their clients. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Generate Investor Interest The embrace of Bitcoin’s futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in late 2021 triggered the entry of major players into the digital asset industry, leading others to push forward and file for Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Esteemed companies such as BlackRock, Fidelity, Citadel, Charles Schwab, and even Nasdaq have entered the fray. As financial experts analyze the situation, they offer valuable advice to investors seeking to capitalize on this evolving landscape. On Wednesday, the price of bitcoin surpassed the $30,000 mark, driven by growing optimism surrounding spot BTC ETF applications submitted by industry giants like BlackRock, WisdomTree, and Valkyrie. However, while BTC has witnessed a remarkable 80% surge in value in 2023, it still remains more than 50% below its peak in November 2021. Presently, US investors have access to bitcoin futures ETFs, which involve investing in futures contracts of BTC—agreements to buy or sell the asset at a predetermined price in the future. But the long-awaited introduction of bitcoin spot ETFs would enable direct investment in the digital currency itself, marking a significant development in the market. Considerations For Investors Amid Prospects Of BTC Spot ETFs The potential introduction of a bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) has raised expectations for increased accessibility to the digital currency, enabling investors to buy and sell bitcoin through a brokerage account. However, it is important to approach this development with caution and thorough consideration, as emphasized by financial experts.

42420027,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUWcLF,1687967982,Ethereum’s Layer 2 Teams Want You to Clone Their Code,"With billions of dollars flocking over the past year to Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync and other “layer 2” blockchain networks that work atop Ethereum, the smart angle among crypto futurists was that the winner (or winners) of this “rollup race” might eventually become the primary gateway by which most people access digital assets.  Initially, each team privately contrived of its own novel approach for building a “rollup” – a blockchain that settles transactions on Ethereum but is quicker and cheaper to use. When these rollup chains began going public in 2020, a cut-throat competition for users ensued, with dueling platforms hell-bent on convincing users that their technology was the best around.  But recently, the dynamic has shifted dramatically: The teams are starting to just give their technology away. After years of toil and costly research and development, most of the teams are suddenly open-sourcing their code – putting it out into the public for anyone to see, edit and upgrade. And now, some rollup teams are even releasing free tools for developers to clone their codebases wholesale.  Earlier this week, Matter Labs, the firm behind the zkSync Etheruem rollup, launched an SDK (software development kit) to help developers construct new blockchains using zkSync’s code. This follows in the footsteps of Optimism and Arbitrum, two of zkSync’s rivals, rolling out similar toolkits in recent months.  By making their code open source and easy to replicate – ostensibly to appeal to crypto community norms and ideals – all of these layer 2 teams are theoretically making it easier for copycat chains to steal away their users.  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  What’s going on?  Executives and industry experts say that the teams now see a future unfolding where there will be many layer 2 blockchains, possibly sharing liquidity and linked by common technology – mini-ecosystems termed superchains or hyperchains. The goal is subtly shifting from building the networks to providing the underlying technology; the teams may be hoping to lay the groundwork for new blockchain ecosystems in which they are uniquely positioned to capture a big chunk of the value.  Today’s incumbent layer 2 platforms won’t fall by the wayside in this new model. “You can think of these new chains as additional distribution channels. Other chain developers will market their chains and get more developers, but essentially, liquidity still flows back to the L2,” said Anurag Arjun, a Polygon co-founder who now runs the blockchain infrastructure firm Avail.  Understanding how victory is being re-defined in the Ethereum rollup race is therefore key to grokking what to expect for the next phase of the crypto industry.  Anthony Rose, senior vice president of technology at Matter Labs, says “philosophy” drove the team’s decision to launch an SDK. Openness and transparency are core to the crypto ethos and they are a key part of the “ZK Credo” Matter Labs just released laying out its vision for zkSync. Optimism and Arbitrum made similar gestures towards crypto’s open ideals when they launched similar tools.  Good public relations is certainly its own reason to go open source. These teams know that they’ll have a better chance of currying favor with developers if they help them kick-start their crypto projects.  The move to open source one’s code isn’t just a PR play, moreover. On a more pragmatic level, open-sourcing technology is also viewed as a way to improve it. As more developers begin making chains with ZK Stack, for example, Matter Labs will have a larger community of builders making improvements to its own chain’s technology – improvements that zkSync Era can itself benefit from.  The Value Capture Play  A more likely – and perhaps, more cynical – way to view these blockchain-in-a-box products is in terms of how they situate their creators at the center of crypto’s value chain.  Today, Ethereum captures most of the value from its roll-up ecosystem. Layer 2 chains ultimately settle transactions on Ethereum and pay fees in ether (ETH), its native currency.  As new ecosystems emerge based around specific rollup technologies, layer 2 chains might have more of a shot at capturing some of this value themselves.  Take Matter Labs and its ZK Stack as an example. According to Rose, “The idea is to have this out-of-the-box toolkit for people to deploy hyperchains, to be able to build what we're thinking of as this future internet of value, in which we have these connected permissionless systems.”  In this “future internet of value,” Matter Labs says zkSync Era will be just one among many compatible blockchains. As it stands now, though, Era is the chain with the most liquidity, the largest number of builders, and the greatest number of platforms already on its network. New blockchains that launch using the ZK Stack could just clone zkSync to compete with it, but they’re more likely to rely on Era for its liquidity and interoperability tech.  “They will absolutely try to control the interoperability, the solution there,” suggests Arjun. “The ZK stack can be open source – just take the stack and deploy it. But if you really want to tap into the liquidity of zkSync Era, here is the mechanism to do it. So that is the moat, in a sense.”  Offchain Labs, the developers behind Arbitrum, seem to have similar motivations for their approach to open source with its new Arbitrum Orbit program.  Offchain Labs allows anyone to build a “layer 3” blockchain that settles transactions on the layer 2 Arbitrum chain.  But when it comes to building layer 2 networks that live alongside Arbitrum, Offchain Labs open-sourced its code under a license that requires explicit sign-off from the Arbitrum DAO. Because Arbitrum DAO members are ARB token holders, they’re incentivized to green-light layer 2 chains that accrue value back to ARB and the Arbitrum ecosystem.  Rollups getting commoditized  Ultimately, as the crypto space and its use cases continue to mature, it’s not altogether clear how any given blockchain might best capture value in the long run – particularly as some tokens (like zkSync’s) have yet to launch, and others (like Arbitrum’s) are currently just used for protocol governance and not for fees.  With this uncertainty, though, rollup teams can do worse than to make sure they stay at the center of things – providing, at least initially, the primary gateway for new chains to start up, earn liquidity and interoperate.  On some level, rollup teams may feel they have no choice but to put their code out into the open. Rollups – particularly those like zkSync that are powered by zero-knowledge (ZK) cryptography – used to be extremely difficult to build. However, as more teams are open-sourcing their code roll-up technology is quickly being commoditized.",NEUTRAL,ETH | ARB,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | ARB | ZK,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/06/28/ethereums-layer-2-teams-want-you-to-clone-their-code,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/463ee8c8dbdfa6b99128660e3e64d57fcf21b9af-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The trust’s trading volume increased to $45 million in June, maintaining its position as the industry’s most traded trust product, accounting for 74% of the volumes, according to CCData.  This comes as multiple high-profile institutions have filed for ETFs in June, including Invesco and WisdomTree, along with BlackRock.  “The surge in GBTC's volumes and market share aligns with the growing positive sentiment towards the underlying asset,” CCData said.  Compared with Grayscale’s ETHE trust, GBTC’s volume significantly outperformed in trading volume. Since September, GBTC's trading volume rose from $35.6 million to $45 million in June 2023, capturing 74% of the total trading volume for trust products, compared to 50.9% in September. ETHE's volumes declined from $31 million in September to $14.4 million in June 2023, and from 44.4% to 23.6% market share.  GBTC also witnessed its share price surge to a one-year high after a report about investment asset manager Fidelity Investments preparing to follow BlackRock’s application for a spot bitcoin ETF with its own.

However, this vision is currently undermined by the prevalence of hacks and breaches that continue to plague the Web3 ecosystem. In 2022 alone, over 450 security breaches resulted in the theft of a staggering $4 billion USD in cryptocurrency, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced security measures. Decentralized applications (DApps), including those utilizing traditional multisig wallets, face a myriad of vulnerabilities that malicious actors exploit. These vulnerabilities range from coding errors in smart contracts to compromised decentralized storage systems and targeted attacks on individual users through phishing and social engineering tactics. The repercussions of such attacks can be devastating, both for the affected individuals and for the broader adoption of Web3 technologies. ""To effectively address these concerns, security must be prioritized from the start,"" emphasized Junming Tan, Crypto Incident Response Investigator APAC at Chainalysis Inc. To protect their digital assets and identities, Web3 users are advised to utilize hardware wallets, enable two-factor authentication, and stay vigilant against phishing attempts. Martinet Lee, Head of Developer Relations at Quantstamp, emphasized the significance of verifying application authenticity and staying informed about potential threats. Following industry standards can ensure higher security in Web3 projects. Tu Phan, Founder and CEO of Desig Labs, highlighted: “To keep users from harm in Web3, projects need to proactively prioritize security measures such as multi-factor authentication, encryption, and secure key management in the battle against hacks and exploits. Desig, for example, employs innovative techniques that eliminate the need for passphrases and leverages zero-knowledge technology to protect private keys from phishing attempts and key recreation by attackers.” However, addressing security challenges in Web3 requires more than just individual efforts. The establishment of regulatory frameworks and standards that cover secure development practices, data protection, privacy standards, and auditing requirements is paramount. Collaboration between regulatory bodies, industry experts, and technologists is essential to striking a balance between innovation and security. Open-source initiatives within the Web3 space, including decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), encourage community collaboration to enhance security practices and foster a more secure ecosystem. Bug bounty programs and responsible disclosure programs play a crucial role in the Web3 security landscape. These initiatives incentivize ethical hackers to identify vulnerabilities, allowing developers to proactively address them. Responsible disclosure programs provide a platform for reporting vulnerabilities, ensuring timely mitigation, and reducing the window of opportunity for potential exploits. Fortunately, emerging trends and technologies offer promising avenues for improved security in Web3 applications. Zero-knowledge proofs, for instance, enable private transactions and verifiable computations, bolstering privacy and security. Advancements in decentralized identity systems and blockchain interoperability contribute to stronger security measures. Projects like Desig Protocol are leveraging these novel technologies early on, aiming to provide a safe and secure environment for Web3 users, enabling them to explore and enjoy the space with confidence. In their workshop session during the event, Tu Phan, Founder and CEO of Desig Labs, demonstrated how users can leverage Desig to enhance security, manage team finance, DAO or gaming guild operations, and explore any Web3 DApp on any chain with a single Desig wallet. The beta version of Desig will be officially launched in June, followed by activation campaigns with multiple prominent and emerging Layer 1s. Details will be released on their Twitter page. By addressing security concerns head-on, both developers and users can contribute to creating a safer Web3 ecosystem. This approach will unlock the full potential of decentralization and the enhanced security offered by Web3, paving the way for a brighter and more secure digital future. With collaborative efforts, robust security measures, and the integration of cutting-edge technologies, we can build a Web3 ecosystem that ensures the protection of user data and facilitates secure online transactions.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Rally Stalls For Now, Here’s Why Even more remarkable is the token’s trading volume, which increased by 287.57% within a 24-hour. The change in trading volume over the past week suggests that XLM bulls worked overtime within these few days. XLM’s trading volume went from less than $60 million to over $200 million in seven days. As of the time of writing, the token’s trading volume stands at $224 million, according to CoinMarketCap data. With this bullish signal, XLM overcame the $0.1 critical threshold observed in Pseudonymous crypto trading expert, Nebraskangooner’s chart pattern analysis on June 27. Stellar’s (XLM) price is now changing hands at $09974, trading above the 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages on its TradingView daily chart. This current trend suggests more bullish moves in the short and long term. Also, its Relative Strength Index at 76 suggests price moves above the overbought region. It has smashed the crucial resistance and support levels, claiming support at $0.102456 in the first hours of 28 June, and may soon hit $0.105 if the uptrend continues. XLM Breaks New Grounds As Stellar Accelerate Network Development Among the factors fueling the bullish momentum is Coinbase’s recent integration with Stellar.org. On June 23, Coinbase integrated the USD Coin stablecoin on Stellar. Following this development, Coinbase fully supports USDC deposits and withdrawals via the Stellar network. Millions of users can now access instance remittance and real-time payments to global fiat and crypto on/off ramps through USDC on Stellar. The news contributed to a boost in XLM market sentiment, evident in the rising trading volume. And, of course, increased trading volume signifies higher demand for the asset, which propels its price. In addition, Stellar announced another partnership with MoonPay, a leading crypto payments infrastructure company. According to the Stellar team, the partnership enables users to seamlessly buy and sell crypto assets, including Stellar assets, across over 160 countries.

Also, on June 22, Stellar partnered with MoneyGram to support streamlined cash deposits and withdrawals from crypto wallets via USDC without a bank account. These partnership deals must have boosted XLM’s user base, leading to an increase in its price.

42420041,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUWcWb,1687963134,First Mover Americas: First Leveraged Bitcoin ETF in U.S. Trades $5.5M on Day One,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Volatility Shares 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITX), the first leveraged bitcoin (and crypto) ETF in the U.S., started trading on Tuesday, witnessing $5.5 million of volume on its first day, according to data from Bloomberg. Action got off to a quick start, with volume of about $500K in the first 15 minutes after the open. By comparison, ProShares’ BITO – the first ever bitcoin ETF (futures-based) in the U.S. – saw roughly $1 billion in volume on its first day of trading in 2021. A number of futures-based bitcoin ETF products trade in the U.S., including now this new leveraged product. The SEC, however, has consistently blocked spot funds from launching – a stance that will again be tested after asset management giant BlackRock earlier this month applied to create a spot bitcoin ETF.  Dollar-pegged stablecoin TrueUSD (TUSD) is trading at a discount relative to peer tether (USDT) on Binance.US, the U.S. subsidiary of Binance. At press time, the TUSD/USDT pair traded at 89 cents on Binance.US, having hit a low of 80 cents on Wednesday, data from charting platform TradingView show. On Binance, the pair traded at around $0.9980. Volatility in stablecoins, which have evolved as funding currencies over the past three years, often feeds into the broader market, though so far this hasn’t happened in this instance as bitcoin continues to trade in a tight range just above $30,000. TUSD, with a market cap of $3 billion, poses less of a systemic risk to the broader market than tether, whose market cap is $83 billion.  Austria-based One Trading, the digital asset exchange formerly known as Bitpanda Pro, has announced a successful €30 million (roughly $33 million) funding round as it separates entirely from Bitpanda. The new platform plans to expand its crypto asset offerings for retail and institutional investors throughout Europe. The raise was led by Valar Ventures, co-founded by billionaire entrepreneur Peter Thiel, and featured participation from MiddleGame Ventures, Speedinvest, Keyrock and Wintermute Ventures. Bitpanda initially launched Bitpanda Pro in 2019 to provide a regulated platform for retail traders, finance professionals and institutions. The company – which hit a $4.1 billion valuation during a funding round in Aug. 2021 – will retain an undisclosed minority stake in One Trading. One Trading will continue to be led by Bitpanda Pro CEO Joshua Barraclough, who joined Bitpanda in late 2021 after a stint as co-head of digital innovation at JPMorgan in London.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows bitcoin's price and the exchange whale ratio since 2017. The exchange whale ratio represents the relative size of the top 10 exchange inflows to total inflows.  The seven-day moving average of the ratio has declined to the lowest since 2018 in a bullish sign for the leading cryptocurrency.  ""It indicates that the whales are less active in the central exchanges. Due to the recent events surrounding the digital asset industry (Hong Kong opening the crypto market, regulatory updates in the U.S., and big TradFi filing BTC spot ETFs), it seems that the whales are taking the wait and see approach at the moment,"" CryptoQuant said.

42420037,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUWcTV,1687962138,"MicroStrategy's Bitcoin Purchases Tend to Be Short-Term Negative for Prices, Research Shows","Early Wednesday, business intelligence firm MicroStrategy (MSTR) announced the purchase of over 12,000 bitcoin (BTC) for $347 million. The fresh accumulation has boosted the company's coin stash to 152,333 BTC.  So far, MicroStrategy's announcement failed to spur bullish action in the bitcoin market, allowing bitcoin to retreat to the lower end of the recent trading range of $30,000 to $31,000.  The dull market response is consistent with the cryptocurrency's record of losing some ground following MicroStrategy's announcements of new coin purchases of over 1,000 BTC, according to data analyzed by K33.  ""MicroStrategy BTC purchase announcements tend to be followed by short-term negative price action in BTC, as the market absorbs the fact that certain buy-side liquidity has left the market,"" Vetle Lunde, research analyst at K33, told CoinDesk.  Since 2020, bitcoin has registered an average daily return of negative 2% on days of MSTR announcements. The average weekly return following MSTR's announcement is slightly positive.  ""The short-term impact tends to reverse in the days that follow, and there are no clear evidence of a prolonged adverse market impact on MicroStrategy announcements, with the average weekly return sitting in slight positive territory,"" Lunde said.

42420023,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUWcI9,1687960846,Consensus Web3athon 2023 Reveals Its Winners,"Web3athon, an annual hackathon event hosted by CoinDesk with partners Alchemy University and HackerEarth, has announced its latest cohort of winners. Six teams building in five blockchain ecosystems will take home over $200,000 in grants to help fund further protocol development.  The six-week virtual event, which ran April to June this year, is focused on bringing more developers into Web3 through partner grant programs. The Web3athon grants were funded by organizations representing the Solana, Polkadot, XDC, OKT Chain and Coreum blockchains.  “[T]he industry needs more developers learning and building in Web3,” Garrett Skrovina, audience partnerships senior manager for CoinDesk’s Consensus event, said in an announcement. “Each protocol approaches ecosystem development differently, so Web3athon provided a platform to showcase the various developer relations initiatives of our partner protocols and foundations.”  “We love Web3athon because it is multichain in nature, connected to Consensus, and attracts top talent across the ecosystem,” a representative for Web3 identity project Civic told CoinDesk. Civic was one of several secondary sponsors, as well as wallet giant Ledger, gender-equality-focused community H.E.R. DAO and Hexens, a Web3 and novel cryptography auditor.  With over 6,400 participants, the winners were selected from over 160 final submissions. The winning projects addressed a wide range of needs around protocol infrastructure and applications, including network privacy, zero-code development and e-commerce. Nearly half of applicants were building on Solana and XDC, with the next most popular networks being Polkadot and the Ethereum and Cosmos-compatible OKT Chain (OKTC).  While not every project takes home funding, previous Web3athons have seen several participants continue to build their applications after the event.  Mike Hale, who was building the first version of Vanward – a tool that helps manage and verify professional certifications – on Solana, plans to continue the work through the ongoing Encode x Solana Summer hackathon.  “I didn't go into Web3athon expecting to win a prize. Instead, I used it as a deadline and motivation to get the first version developed,” Hale said.  While hackathons are only one step in creating a diverse and sustainable software industry, they are designed to get people into the ring, and to start building. They play a critical role in incubating innovation, spurring open-source development and building communities.  Here are this year’s winners:  OKT Chain (OKX) winner: Obsidian  Obsidian, a protocol that enables “stealth” payments on Ethereum, was reportedly inspired by a tweet from Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin, who was wishing for a way to “send coins to an [Ethereum Name Service address] without publishing to the world that they got coins.”  Built on Cosmos-based OKT Chain, Obsidian uses elliptic-curve cryptography and other cryptographic techniques that will enable users to send ERC20 tokens, perhaps the most popular token-type on Ethereum, with discretion.  In short, the tool helps users spin up a fresh blockchain address to send coins to – which remains pseudo-anonymous to the wider world, but is accessible by the transaction’s recipient. Vitalik would be proud.  The project is currently live on an Evmos testnet (a testing ground for the network that is building connections between Ethereum and Cosmos), with plans to launch onto the mainnet, according to the project’s GitHub.  Polkadot winner: Risc-Roll  During hackathons, it’s not uncommon for participants to build apps that would impress developers but perhaps be arcane to regular crypto users. Risc-Roll is arguably one of those projects. For instance, the tagline for the application is: “ZK-protocols for any Substrate chain, in plain Rust.”  In plain English, the team essentially wanted to show that it’s possible to bring zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs onto Polkadot – one of the largest multi-chain networks – in Rust, a programming language used widely outside the world of crypto. ZK proofs are a type of privacy-preserving cryptography that crypto developers push to theoretical limits for use in blockchain scaling and security.  ZK proofs are “severely underutilized” on Polkadot, the Risc-Roll team wrote. By building an example of how the technology can be deployed using a popular programming language, the team said “we can turn any of the 100s of existing Substrate devs into zk-capable devs.”  Solana winner: Synap  Synap’s mission statement begins with something of a truism: crypto users exist, but decentralized app (dapp) developers or companies with products to sell are not always able to reach them. To some extent, it’s a problem of crypto’s own making by trying to subvert the privacy-invasive data economy of Web2.  One of Web3’s answers to this issue of “user acquisition” is something called a “social passport.” Social passports solve for user acquisition without sacrificing on user autonomy by building data profiles that are controlled ultimately by users.  Synap’s blockchain-based data economy takes information from social media, on-chain transactions and a person’s “awareness and involvement in the ecosystem” to assign what they call a “degen score.” Users receive a dynamic non-fungible token (NFT) that represents their “social and financial” histories, which is theirs and theirs alone.  In theory, projects looking to onboard new users can turn to Synap to offer people discounts, airdrops and personalized dapp experiences. And considering the roster of backers which includes the Solana Foundation, Underdog Protocol and Superteam (all Solana heavy-weights), wider adoption seems likely.  See also: Solana Foundation: SOL Is 'Not a Security'  XDC winner: Fuelstack  You may not have heard of the XinFin protocol, or XDC for short. But using it may feel familiar. XDC is an enterprise-grade, open-source fork of Ethereum that provides the same smart contract capabilities but shrinks transaction times to two seconds and gas fees to almost nothing. (And like other enterprise blockchain solutions, it achieves scalability by sacrificing on decentralization through a delegated proof-of-stake mechanism).  FuelStack, a crypto-based e-commerce platform, is built on the XinFin protocol, but will actually remain blockchain-agnostic, the founding team said. The platform is powering xSPECTAR, an immersive metaverse with a built-in marketplace and NFT functionality.  “We intend to focus on people who desire to move or trade within hyper-realistic upscale environments and have a desire to meet like-minded people. We make our network available to our community through our xSPECTAR tokens and NFTs,” the project’s white paper reads.  Even during the bear market, a number of legacy brands are continuing to build out metaverse and Web3 strategies. Conceivably, a few of them would be attracted by an enterprise-grade solution.  Coreum grant inductees: Birdhouse and Backlog  Coreum, the compliance-focused layer 1 blockchain that’s part of the wider Inter‑Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC), chose two grant recipients this year. They must still deliver their code to win the grant.  Blocklog, which focuses on “observability and monitoring,” is building a data intelligence developer tool for tracking and analyzing blockchains, smart contracts and decentralized apps to enhance a project’s performance and reliability.  See also: What Is an Enterprise Blockchain?  Birdhouse, meanwhile, is developing the Coreum Processing Service, a setup tool to help businesses integrate with Coreum and create Coreum-based infrastructure and projects. The project, which is still working on its final submission, is developing a service that allows merchants and other businesses to accept crypto.  In particular, the team wants the service to simplify integration to simple REST requests (short for representational state transfers, a core building block of the Web), making transaction authentication and access easier.",POSITIVE,SOL | XDC,BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | ETH | SOL | XDC,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/06/28/consensus-web3athon-2023-reveals-its-winners,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/42497627c9a3770972e0e346e9623ddc09ad05eb-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Earlier today, blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain spotted a major shift involving a substantial exchange between leading cryptocurrencies. The tracker detected a transaction where a whale divested significant holdings of Chainlink (LINK) and Binance Coin (BNB) to acquire a massive amount of Pepe (PEPE) and Ethereum (ETH). Swapping LINK And BNB For PEPE And ETH Lookonchain’s tweet disclosed the surprising revelation that the whale withdrew 1.93 trillion PEPE, roughly equating to $3.03 million, from leading crypto exchange Binance within the last day. Related Reading: PEPE Coin Shines Among Top Gainers, Tallies 78% In Last Week This immense withdrawal has been made possible by liquidating considerable positions in LINK and BNB. A whale withdrew 1.93T $PEPE ($3.03M) from #Binance 11 hrs ago. The whale appears to have sold 97,735 $LINK ($592K) and 9,883 $BNB ($3.01M) at a loss of ~$342K, swapping all positions for 1.93T $PEPE ($3.03M) and 227 $ETH ($424K).https://t.co/J7GIyl6di8 pic.twitter.com/MrNQcnLEpC — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 28, 2023 According to the report, the whale sold 97,735 LINK, estimated to be worth $592,000, and 9,883 BNB at an approximate loss of $342,000. The funds derived from these sales were then directed towards purchasing PEPE and ETH, marking a shift in this entity’s crypto portfolio. Strategic Crypto Rebalancing Or Market Speculation? The reasoning behind such a move by the whale is speculative at best. However, it’s evident that this whale sees potential in PEPE and ETH over the previously held LINK and BNB. The purchase of 227 ETH alongside the substantial acquisition of PEPE could be perceived as a diversification strategy, with Ethereum being a more stable, well-established asset complementing the more volatile Pepe. These large-scale moves by whales often bring about significant impacts on the prices and trading volumes of the involved cryptocurrencies. Such activities underline the dynamic nature of the crypto markets, and the continual monitoring of these ‘whale moves’ remains a critical aspect of understanding market trends. Over the past 24 hours, Ethereum has seen a 0.7% with a current trading price of $1,862. This slight decline follows the second-largest asset by market cap initial surge of nearly 10% in the past weeks. ETH has spiked from as low as $1,633 amid the Binance and Coinbase US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit to trade above $1,800, at the time of writing. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Indicators Signal Extended Correction To $1,790 On the other hand, PEPE has declined 5.7% in the last 24 hours following the asset’s double-digit gain of nearly 50% in the past week. PEPE currently trades at $0.00000154 with a 24-hour trading volume of $149 million. Meanwhile, the frog-themed meme coin currently has a market capitalization of $649 million, ranking it 67th among the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap.

14283754,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=540066,1687957234,"Bitcoin Correlation To Gold, Silver Drops To Cyclical Lows: Glassnode","Data from Glassnode shows the Bitcoin correlation to Gold and Silver has taken a plunge toward cyclical lows recently. Bitcoin Correlation With Gold & Silver Has Now Turned Negative According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the latest price action in BTC has decoupled the cryptocurrency from commodities such as Gold and Silver. The “correlation” here is an indicator that tells us how closely Bitcoin has been moving with any particular asset, over a given time period. In the context of the current discussion, the 30-day time period is of interest. When the value of the correlation is positive, it means that the cryptocurrency is mimicking the movements of the other asset currently. Negative values of the indicator, on the other hand, suggest BTC has been moving in the opposite direction to the commodity’s price. Naturally, the higher the value of the metric (whether on the positive or the negative scale), the stronger the response of Bitcoin to movements in the asset in question. The correlation can also attain a value of zero during periods where there isn’t any discernible pattern between the prices of the two assets (like when one of the assets moves sideways while the other is experiencing some kind of volatility). Related Reading: Bitcoin Holders Expect Retrace, Will BTC Move Against Crowd Once Again? Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin 30-day correlation to Gold and Silver over the last few years: Looks like the value of the metric has plunged in recent days | Source: Glassnode on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin 30-day correlation to both Gold and Silver had been high just recently, but with the latest surge in the cryptocurrency, the indicator’s value has taken a deep hit. Following this plunge, the metric’s value has fallen inside the negative territory for both these assets, with BTC’s correlation to XAU (the price of one troy ounce of Gold) hitting -0.78, while that to XAG (one ounce of Silver) going even deeper to -0.90. In the case of Gold, the correlation between the two assets is now close to the cyclical lows, while for Silver, the indicator has already set a new cyclical low with this plummet. Related Reading: XRP Traders Show Capitulation, Why This Could Be Bullish Bitcoin is currently showing such a highly negative correlation to these commodities because of the fact that their prices have been going down recently, while the cryptocurrency has observed a very sharp rally at the same time. The current values of the 30-day correlation pose an interesting shift of trend, as except for a period between late February and early March, Bitcoin had been tightly moving in tandem with these traditional assets since the rally started back in January of this year.

42420046,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUX8Bx,1687957200,Maple Finance Expands to Direct Lending Targeting Web3 Firms,"Blockchain-based credit marketplace Maple Finance expands to direct lending, aspiring to fill the vacuum that the implosion of centralized lenders like BlockFi and Genesis created.  The team behind Maple will start its own direct lending desk called Maple Direct to underwrite and issue loans to Web3 businesses starting in July, the firm announced in a press release Wednesday.  The new operation means a significant change in Maple’s direction. Until now, Maple has defined itself as a technology provider developing a blockchain-enabled platform to connect lenders and borrowers via lending pools, each managed by a third-party credit company called delegate underwriting the loans.  Maple’s expansion comes at a time when digital asset firms face challenges to secure banking ties and financing. The sharp downturn of cryptocurrency markets last year wiped out multiple centralized crypto lenders such as BlockFi, Celsius or Genesis, while traditional financial firms are wary of servicing digital asset firms, leaving the industry with limited options for borrowing.  “There’s a big gap in the market because of the exit of those players,” Sidney Powell, co-founder and CEO of Maple Finance said in an interview with CoinDesk. “This is like a natural extension of what Maple can do as a protocol.”  Maple Direct  Maple Direct will work as a separate lending pool on the platform, Powell explained. To do so, the company created a subsidiary domiciled in Delaware that will act as a pool delegate to underwrite loans and manage the portfolio.  “We have the expertise in-house as we all came from banking and credit backgrounds, Powell said, adding that they “learned the lessons from last year observing delegates.”  Notably, lending pools on Maple accrued $54 millions of unsecured bad debt to trading firms hit by the sudden collapse of crypto exchange FTX late 2022, leaving investors in limbo for months. A part of those loans has been restructured, while still pursuing recovery for assets as part of Orthogonal Trading’s liquidation process.  The lending pool aims to raise funds from crypto funds, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), venture capital firms, family offices and high-net worth individuals, and will lend to web3 native businesses in sectors including asset management, infrastructure and liquidity providers.  Over-collateralized loans  Maple Direct will start with offering over-collateralized loans, Powell said, meaning that borrowers must lock-up more assets in value than the size of the loan. The lending desk will give loans in USDC and USDT stablecoins, and will accept bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and staked ETH as collateral.  The loans will be executed on the blockchain with smart contracts, while the terms and loan book will be visible on Maple’s public loan dashboard. The reason for doing this on-chain is transparency, Powell said.  “Clients of centralized lenders never got reporting on the level of collateral backing loans, the equity protection and financial health of the borrower,” Powell explained. “Here, [investors in the pool] get reporting in real time on all the borrowers, how they are performing and the level of collateral.”",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | SPONSORED,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/06/28/maple-finance-expands-to-direct-lending-targeting-web3-firms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a8b8455720d3317e7c273e317428efc82d94942c-1227x920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Ledger Enterprise Tradelink network, announced Wednesday, has signed up a number of crypto exchange and broker partners including Crypto.com, Bitstamp, Huobi, Uphold, CEX.IO, Wintermute, Coinsquare, NDAX, Damex, Bitazza, Flowdesk and YouHodler.  In the wake of events like last year's bankruptcy of FTX, firms are looking for transparency and alternatives to having assets held on vertically integrated crypto exchanges. There are also concerns over how market infrastructure will pan out in light of recent lawsuits from U.S. regulators against Binance and Coinbase, said Sebastien Badault, VP Enterprise at Ledger.  “This solution connects custodians, OTC brokers and exchanges, and means you can trade without having funds on the exchange, so it removes that exchange risk,” Badault said in an interview with CoinDesk. “Looking forward, there’s going to be a lot more regulation potentially around being able to distribute your risk, so that aligning fund managers and multiple custodial partners will definitely be a big plus.”  Ledger’s enterprise network is open to multiple custodial partners, such as Komainu (a Nomura-backed group of which Ledger is a member), TetraTrust, Etana, Crypto Garage, Damex and Kryptodian.  Being open to multiple custodial platforms means firms using the new network will not be locked in, Ledger said. Ledger Enterprise also offers real-time tracking of collateral balances and operational status for all participants, with zero transaction fees, according to a press release.

Like the main Syscoin blockchain, the Rollux network is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine or EVM, the software that executes smart contracts on Ethereum. The project gets its security from Bitcoin miners via a process known as merged mining that originally was presented by Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto in 2010.  Just as layer 2 networks or “rollups” atop the Ethereum blockchain allow for faster transactions, the Rollux network can process 700 transactions per second assuming basic transfer, versus three to five per second on the base Syscoin layer, according to Sys Labs CEO Jagdeep Sidhu.  “Merged mining is a way to provide another system to open the doors to scale into a rollup,” Sidhu said in an interview. He said the project has been in the works for eight years.  Rollups like Optimism, Arbitrum and zkSync have profilerated atop Ethereum, notorious for its sometimes exorbitant fees, as a means of avoiding congestion. Bitcoin (BTC) is the original and largest blockchain and is considered the most secure, but lacks Ethereum’s programmability via smart contracts.

14282319,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=540080,1687953616,Bitcoin Miners Send 315% Of Daily Revenue To Exchanges Recording High Interaction,"In the fast-paced world of Bitcoin mining, recent unusual activity has caught the attention of cryptocurrency watchers. Particularly, a surge in exchange interactions has been observed, with Bitcoin miners sending a record amount to exchanges. Prominent on-chain analytics firm, Glassnode, has been at the forefront of tracking these transactions. In a recent tweet, the firm reported that Bitcoin miners have been engaging in a noteworthy level of interaction with exchanges, transferring an all-time high of $128 million worth of Bitcoin. Exceptional Exchange Activity By Miners The significant update found in this report is the amount of funds involved. According to Glassnode, the $128 million sent to exchanges by Bitcoin miners represents 315% of their daily revenue. The on-chain analytics firm tweeted: Bitcoin Miners are currently recording extremely high Exchange interaction, sending an ATH of $128 million to Exchanges, equivalent to 315% of their daily revenue. Related Reading: Lightning Network Hits Record Highs In Bitcoin And US Dollar Capacity Typically, the transfer of coins from miner or investor wallets to exchanges is perceived as an intention to sell or liquidate coins. However, in this context, it can also be seen as a reflection of optimism about Bitcoin’s future price potential. Implications And Market Perception The mining revenue in the Bitcoin network is intimately linked with the price of Bitcoin. Therefore, miners tend to increase their sales when they perceive the market to be robust enough to absorb the additional supply. This recent move could indicate strong confidence in the current market strength. Glassnode, in additional tweets, points out a growing trend of strong accumulation and a shift towards self-custody, especially in the wake of the recent LUNA debacle and FTX fallout. This suggests an increasing trend among investors and miners towards maintaining control of their own assets as opposed to relying on third-party custodians. Regardless, Bitcoin has seen a slight decline in the past 24 hours, down by 0.6% with a trading price still above the recently reclaimed $30,000. Prior to the retracement, Bitcoin has since been on an upward trajectory over the past two weeks up by more than 10%. Bitcoin surged from trading below $25,000 amid the intensified regulatory scrutiny from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which eventually affected the world’s largest crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase as the US regulator filed a lawsuit against both companies for the offering of unregistered securities. Related Reading: BTC Continues Uptrend As Fidelity Plans To Submit Bitcoin Spot ETF Filing However, weeks following the lawsuit, BTC was quick to recover with more than $100 billion added to its market cap in the last 14 days, up by 16.8%. Interestingly, BTC’s daily trading volume has recorded a plunge in the past week. The assets’ daily trading volume has declined from a high of $31 billion last Wednesday to a low of $16 billion in the last 24 hours.

42420050,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUX8G5,1687953600,Crypto Ponzi Schemes Cost Victims $7.8B in 2022: TRM Labs,"Crypto criminals have moved on from bitcoin to other cryptocurrencies, was the main takeaway from a report released Wednesday by blockchain analytics company TRM Labs.  While crypto prices have been depressed over the past couple of years, the earnings of scammers and hackers have not, the Elicit Crypto Ecosystem Report showed. Crypto Ponzi schemes extracted at least $7.8 billion from victims in 2022. Overall, over $9 billion in crypto has been sent to addresses associated with various frauds and scams in 2022, including Ponzi schemes. Such frauds most often use USDT based on the Tron blockchain.  Various DeFi exploits brought attackers $3.7 billion, including $2 billion stolen from cross-chain bridges. And around $1.5 billion went to darknet marketplaces selling illegal drugs, TRM said.  To cover their tracks, crypto criminals increasingly rely on so-called chain hopping, moving money from one blockchain to another so that it’s harder to track the funds from the outside. As a result, bitcoin’s share in such crimes decreased from 97% in 2016 to 19% in 2022, TRM wrote.  “In 2016, two-thirds of crypto hack volume was on Bitcoin; in 2022, it accounted for just under 3%, with Ethereum (68%) and Binance Smart Chain (19%) dominating the field,” the report. TRM also found that bitcoin is no longer the preferred coin for terrorism financing: now USDT on the Tron blockchain is dominating that market. The cryptocurrency is especially popular with ISIS and its affiliates in Pakistan and Tajikistan, TRM said.  To be sure, both bitcoin and tether (USDT) are among the most popular and liquid cryptocurrencies, making them a preferable payment method for many use cases outside of crime, too.  Read also: This Is How Scammers Can Drain Your Crypto Wallet  In some corners of the criminal underworld, bitcoin is still king, for example, Russian darknet marketplaces, which are dominating the sector (80% of the market), mostly accept bitcoin only as payment for narcotics and other illegal goods. Large Western marketplaces of this kind often accept monero as well, but their share in the overall darknet economy is much smaller, TRM wrote.  Websites offering pornographic photos and videos of children (known as child sexual abuse materials, or CSAM) received no less than $3.32 million in 2022, however, more than two thirds of those funds went not to actual CSAM vendors but to scammers who sold access to non-existing content, TRM said.",NEGATIVE,USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | USDT | BNB,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/06/28/crypto-ponzi-schemes-cost-victims-78b-in-2022-trm-labs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4fe2d6373e9ba2baeb252cffb2b2b98a984a105a-2129x1408.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Elementals Rakes In $38M In Presale The fervor around Azuki Elementals has resulted in the collection being whisked off just 15 minutes after its drop. The third iteration of the highly popular Azuki universe, the Elementals collection, covers four different domains - Lightning, Earth, Water, and Fire. Although there were 20,000 NFTs in the collection, they did not even make it to the public sale market. The first 10,000 NFTs were directly airdropped to Azuki holders during the recent Vegas event. The remaining 10,000 NFTs were put up for presale, first for Azuki holders and ten minutes later for Beanz holders. The initial plan was to follow the presale up with a public auction. However, the entire collection got sold out within 15 minutes of minting for 20,000 ETH, which is around $38 million. Frustration And Disappointment? The minting process evoked diverse responses, with numerous individuals, primarily Azuki holders, expressing joy and satisfaction over their successful minting experience. However, there was an overwhelming sense of frustration from those who were unable to secure a mint and disappointment from those who were not happy with the NFTs themselves. Since there was no minting cap imposed on the presale, many Azuki holders took the opportunity to mint more than 10 NFTs, with one user minting a total of 332 Elementals. As a result, even many Beanz holders were unable to participate. Plus, many users commented on the Elementals collection, claiming that the anime art bore a striking resemblance to the original Azuki collection. Azuki’s Response The Azuki team has taken the negative feedback in its stride and responded to it on Twitter, claiming that the goal was to create characters that felt consistent with the Azuki aesthetic while offering something new by introducing the domains and the unique traits and features tied to the specific domains. The team wrote, “It's always both challenging & exciting opening up the gate to the Garden. This time, we missed the mark. We hear you - the mint process was hectic, the PFPs feel similar and, even worse, dilutive to Azuki…However, our ambitious goals led to a new collection which confused the community on the tangible differences with the original Azuki collection…Azuki’s vision is to build a decentralized brand. Doing so requires great communication and execution, both of which were lacking with the Elementals sale. We know that we lost a piece of trust today, but nothing gets us more motivated to make things right.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The intersection of liquid staking and DeFi, known as LSDfi, is a rapidly growing market segment with significant growth potential. Regulatory uncertainty poses a potential risk to the crypto staking sector, but Ethereum's dominance in liquid staking solidifies its position at the forefront of the crypto industry. The current TVL in LSDfi protocols is small compared to the total addressable liquid staking market, indicating significant growth potential. Regulatory uncertainty poses a potential risk to the crypto staking sector. Editor's note: Seeking Alpha is proud to welcome Mandela Amoussou as a new contributor.

Click here to find out more » Thesis Liquid staking, an advanced form of crypto staking, presents a compelling opportunity for crypto investors. With its ability to provide liquidity, flexibility, and potential for growth, liquid staking has become a significant trend in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. As Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) leads the way in liquid staking and the emerging LSDfi market segment gains momentum, investors stand to benefit from participating in this evolving ecosystem, while keeping an eye on regulatory developments to mitigate potential risks. Overview Crypto staking is a core feature of proof-of-stake (PoS) cryptocurrency networks; it is needed to secure and validate transactions on a PoS network. PoS crypto networks have become popular over the years as several concerns about the carbon footprint created by energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain networks, like Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), have been raised. In a PoW network, miners who make use of resource-intensive computing power to validate transactions and secure the network are rewarded with a crypto coin. In a PoS network, users, known as validator nodes, secure the network and validate transactions by locking up some of the native crypto assets of the blockchain—a process known as staking. Crypto staking has gained popularity among crypto investors—especially investors with a buy-and-hold portfolio strategy—and has become a way for crypto investors to earn regular passive income. The total value locked ((TVL)) of staked crypto assets has become one of the important metrics in measuring the state of the crypto market and the value of assets. TVL in crypto staking jumped from around $400 million in 2020 to ~$2 billion in 2022. With the introduction of liquid staking (which this article is focused on), TVL continues to grow on major blockchains. In Q1 2023 , TVL on Ethereum increased by 33.6%, while Arbitrum ( ARB-USD ) had a whopping TVL increase of 83.4%. The Evolution of Crypto Staking The crypto space is fast-paced and ever-evolving. Like other crypto trends, crypto staking has indeed evolved significantly over the years; various staking mechanisms such as DeFi staking and liquid staking have been introduced, each with distinct concepts that offer different approaches to staking crypto assets. PoS Staking PoS staking is sometimes referred to as traditional staking. It is the earliest form of crypto staking. PoS staking refers to the process of participating in the consensus of a PoS blockchain network by locking up a certain amount of cryptocurrency to support network operations. By staking or ""locking up"" coins, participants contribute to the network's security and transaction validation process, earning rewards in return. Traditional staking typically involves locking up funds for a predetermined period, during which the staked assets are illiquid and cannot be freely used or traded. Depending on the specific PoS blockchain, staking participants may not have the ability to unstake and withdraw assets at any time, while some PoS blockchains have lock-up periods or require a notice period for the unstaking of assets. DeFi Staking DeFi staking refers to staking activities carried out within DeFi ecosystems. It involves locking up crypto assets in smart contracts within DeFi protocols. DeFi staking offers additional benefits like liquidity, yield farming, and participation in governance. Unlike PoS staking, which is considered rigid and illiquid, DeFi staking provides greater flexibility. Users can typically stake and unstake their assets at any time, allowing for liquidity and immediate access to funds. Liquid Staking Liquid staking is the latest trend in crypto staking. It is an advanced form of PoS staking that eliminates the rigidness and illiquidity that comes with traditional staking. Liquid staking provides a tokenized representation of a staked crypto asset. When a crypto asset is staked, a ""receipt"" that represents the underlying asset's value is issued. This ""receipt,"" which is in the form of a financial instrument known as a liquid staking derivative ((LSD)), can be traded or used across DeFi protocols without needing to first unstake the underlying asset. LSD provides on-the-go liquidity for staked crypto assets. Another perk of liquid staking is the low barrier to entry it gives users. Running a solo PoS node could be expensive for the average user, costing thousands of dollars in most cases. With liquid staking, users can participate in the staking process with just a few dollars. For example, running a solo Ethereum node requires staking 32 ETH, but with liquid staking, a user can stake a fraction of ETH. Liquid Staking on Ethereum Ethereum began its transition from PoW to PoS consensus in December 2021, when it launched the Beacon Chain and allowed the staking of ETH. The move to PoS was completed on April 12 in a blockchain upgrade called the Shanghai or Shapella upgrade. Liquid staking has gained massive momentum following the Shanghai upgrade on the Ethereum blockchain. The idea of users staking their ETH and at the same time getting a derivative token that is usable on DeFi platforms, for purposes like lending and yield farming, was far-reaching. Several analysts have called liquid staking ""the biggest crypto trend of 2023,"" and the fastest-growing DeFi category in terms of total value locked. The TVL on some liquid staking protocols has surpassed the TVL on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Though the Ethereum network has a giant share of total LSD volume, the liquid staking trend has spread to other blockchain networks. Liquid Staking TVL Across Multiple Blockchains (twitter.com/CryptoRank_io) Recent data reveal that of the ~$57 billion TVL recorded on the Ethereum network, ~$17 billion are locked in liquid staking—an impressive 30% of Ethereum's TVL. Other blockchains like Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ), Solana ( SOL-USD ), and Kava ( KAVA-USD ) have seen some uptick in liquid staking activities; however, Ethereum remains the blockchain with the highest liquid staking TVL. Ethereum takes the lead in liquid staking, with Lido Finance ( LDO-USD ) having a giant market share of staked ETH deposits. On the BNB chain, Ankr Network ( ANKR-USD ) is the largest liquid staking provider. LSDfi: The Intersection of Liquid Staking and DeFi A recent report published by Binance Research, on June 16, 2023, highlights the state of LSDs and the steady increase of the liquid staking market. The report explores newer DeFi protocols built on LSD and older DeFi protocols that have recently integrated LSD. These protocols have created a fusion of DeFi and liquid staking and have created a new market segment fondly called LSDfi. LSDfi protocols have experienced a rapid increase in total value locked ((“TVL”)) over the past few months, benefiting from the adoption of liquid staking. As the narrative gained steam, cumulative TVL in top LSDfi protocols crossed the US$400M mark and has more than doubled since a month ago. Source: Binance Research LSDfi is the newest crypto-staking narrative; it is growing rapidly and has the potential to catch up with the TVL of LSDs. The current TVL in LSDFi protocols is just ~3% of the total addressable LSD market, creating much headroom for growth. According to the Binance Research report, the TVL in LSDfi protocols across all chains is ~$400 million. This figure in comparison with the liquid staking TVL on Ethereum alone (~$17 billion) shows that the LSDFi segment is fairly nascent and the untapped volume is huge. Potential Gains and Risks As mentioned earlier, liquid staking is now available in virtually every major PoS blockchain. But for the scope of this article, I would stick to LSDs on the Ethereum blockchain, the top liquid staking protocols on Ethereum, and how Ethereum has been the main beneficiary of the LSD narrative growth. Just when Ethereum was losing significant NFT and DeFi market share to competing smart-contract blockchains after the 2021 crypto bull run, the transition to PoS and the introduction of liquid staking has given Ethereum the needed comeback to dominate the DeFi and NFT space. A recent report shows that Ethereum's market cap dominance is on the rise. I believe that as the LSDfi narrative gains more momentum, Ethereum could easily maintain this dominance in the coming months or even years. 2023 Q1 DeFi Ecosystem Overview (CoinGecko) Liquid staking protocols on the Ethereum network and their governance tokens have also done well in Q1 2023. Lido Finance takes the lead as the protocol with the most staked ETH deposits. The governance tokens of these ETH-based staking protocols have seen impressive returns post-Shapella. Lido Finance's governance token LDO and RocketPool's token ( RPL-USD ) led the crypto market gains in mid-May, defying the downward price trend of the broader crypto market in that period. Data from the CoinGecko Crypto Industry Report for Q1 2023 reveal that liquid staking governance tokens had an impressive 210.9% quarter-on-quarter change in Q1, with LDO and RPL taking the lead. With the recent SEC clampdown on centralized exchanges' staking-as-a-service offerings, the volume of staking on decentralized protocols like Lido and Rocket Pool will most likely see a steady increase over time. Though the SEC hasn't issued any set-in-stone rules related to crypto staking, no on-chain permissionless staking protocols have been sanctioned by the SEC yet. The lack of regulatory clarity, however, still poses some threat to the booming crypto-staking sector. This same sentiment was shared by Jacob Blish, head of business development at Lido Finance, earlier this year. Final Thoughts In conclusion, crypto staking has emerged as a significant force in the cryptocurrency industry, offering investors a way to take part in consensus, earn passive income, and participate in the evolving world of DeFi. The introduction of liquid staking has revolutionized the crypto staking landscape, providing better liquidity and flexibility to staked assets. As the liquid staking market continues to grow, particularly within the emerging LSDfi segment, there is immense potential for further expansion and adoption. Regulatory clarity, however, remains crucial to ensure the sustained growth and stability of the crypto-staking sector. With Ethereum's dominance reaffirmed through liquid staking, we can expect continued advancements and opportunities in the liquid staking space and the solidification of Ethereum's position at the forefront of the crypto industry.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | ICO | MARKET,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4614067-ethereum-crypto-staking-liquid-staking-derivatives-are-taking-over?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/14281252.jpeg

It was announced by the chairman of the SNB at a conference on Monday that the central bank will pilot a wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC). Chairman Thomas Jordan, quoted by Reuters, said of the pilot: ""This is not just an experiment, it will be real money equivalent to bank reserves and the objective is to test real transactions with market participants,"" On the subject of retail CBDCs Jordan was more circumspect. He admitted that they implied a risk to the financial system and that their use was “more difficult to control”. ""We do not exclude that we will never introduce retail [CBDCs] but nevertheless we are a little bit prudent at the moment,"" Opinion The chairman of the SNB may say that he is being “a little bit prudent” but behind the scenes, as well as openly, many countries’ central banks are racing to complete their CBDCs in what they would probably perceive as the only way to keep the fiat monetary system going. The Bank of International Settlements (BIS), which is considered the central bank of all the world’s central banks, has urged all countries to speed up their development of CBDCs, stating its concerns over crypto and stablecoins. As fiat currencies become more worthless at an ever-increasing rate, it is likely to be far more difficult for governments and central banks to maintain the narrative that it is right and proper for citizens to keep cash in the bank. CBDC in the UK In the UK, inflation is higher and more persistent than in most other European countries, and with mortgage owners already screaming with the pain of interest rates that have tripled in the last two years, things are going to get a lot worse before they get better. The UK does appear to be taking consumer concerns into account with its own potential CBDC rollout. Privacy is being dealt with by the integration of zero-knowledge proof technology. However, that is not to say that this particular element might be withdrawn once CBDCs are fully implemented. No matter how they may be dressed up, CBDCs will only ever be another manifestation of fiat currency. Every single fiat currency in the history of the world has failed and has gone to zero. Bitcoin is outside of this system, is sound money with a fixed supply and cannot be manipulated or confiscated by any government or agency. It is incumbent on every citizen to educate themselves on this asset. Their future may depend on it. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

While the long-term outlook looks extremely bullish due to various Bitcoin spot ETF applications, there are currently a few reasons in the short-term which prevent a continuation for now. Today, Wednesday, June 28, several negative news are weighing on the market’s sentiment. First and foremost, the depegging of the fourth largest stablecoin by market cap, TrueUSD (TUSD), may have unsettled investors. As Bitcoinist reported earlier today, the latest revelations surrounding Prime Trust have raised new doubts that TUSD is fully backed with reserves. Remarkably, TUSD is the most important trading pair (BTC/TUSD) in the entire market, with around 15% and $2.6 billion in trading volume on Binance in the last 24 hours. The rumors could have a negative impact, as shown by previous stablecoin depeggings by USDT and USDC. 🚨 TUSD depegging: New crypto drama unfolding? 1/@adamscochran raises several red flags: – Auditor who attested $TUSD audits (in Prime Trust) is the rebranded old FTX US auditor – Oracle price is obtained from a single entity – Bank partners are unknown — Jake Simmons (@realJakeSimmons) June 28, 2023 Another factor that is probably having a negative impact on the Bitcoin price is the behavior of Bitcoin miners. As Glassnode reports today, Bitcoin miners are currently experiencing extremely high interaction with exchanges, sending an all-time high of $128 million in BTC to exchanges, representing 315% of their daily revenue. In an analysis today, CryptoQuant writes that miners have sent over $1 billion in BTC to exchanges since June 15. About 33,860 BTC were sent to derivatives exchanges, although the majority flowed back into their own wallets. Miners saw a reduction in their reserves of about 8,000 BTC. Remarkably, only a small portion was sent to spot trading exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Struggles As Bears Attempt To Drive It Below $30,000 According to the on-chain experts, this could indicate that miners are using their newly minted coins as collateral in derivatives trading. A good example of this type of trading is so-called “hedging,” where bets are made in the opposite direction to the market consensus. Bitcoin Consolidates, More Reasons Also weighing on market sentiment could be the record-breaking amount of BTC options expiring on Friday, June 30. Traders could take a wait-and-see approach in the run-up. However, Greeks.Live analysts comment that institutions such as Fidelity and BlackRock continue to drive the positive developments; the volume of BTC block calls now accounts for more than a third of the total volume. “Both BTC and ETH are currently significantly above their maxpain points, but due to the weakness in ETH prices, a large number of market makers have continued to sell ETH calls, while buyers have concentrated more on BTC, which has caused ETH IV to be significantly lower than BTC,” the analysts say. Related Reading: Bitcoin Starts To Bite Back Says Reptilian Technical Signal The market may also be on a wait-and-see approach ahead of Friday’s release of the PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditure) index numbers. “After a similar PCE report spurred BTC from $26k to $28k, we wait with bated breath. A positive PCE outcome can spark a bullish uptrend in BTC,” the co-founders of Glassnode (@Negentropic_) write. Last but not least, it should be noted that Bitcoin price is facing an extremely important resistance area $31,000 and consolidation is normal. After last week’s rapid rise, the daily RSI is still just below the overbought area at 66.3. As analyst @52Skew points out, BTC remains in a tight consolidation, with price fluctuating between supply and demand blocks. “4H / 1D EMAs catching up to price & in key $29K area,” the analyst notes via Twitter and surmises, referring to Binance Open interest, “Pretty much still the same, chop chop. Eventually there will be liquidity grab imo; which will probably lead to a trap.” At press time, the Bitcoin price remained in its tight consolidation range.

In the same announcement, it has also supported the majority of previous advice from the Council of Financial Regulators (CFR) on de-banking that could affect change for crypto-related entities.  Recently, Australia has seen the Commonwealth Bank (CBA) apply partial restrictions citing ""scams and the amount of money lost by customers"" and Binance Australia halt Australian dollar (AUD) deposits and withdrawals by bank transfer ""due to a decision made"" by a third-party payment service provider.  Last year, the CFR gave the government four recommendations on potential policy responses to de-banking.

42420045,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUX8Av,1687948191,"EU Publishes Digital Euro Bill Featuring Privacy Controls, Offline Guarantee","BRUSSELS, Belgium – The European Commission published its legislative plans to underpin a digital euro on Wednesday, saying it would ensure Europeans can pay digitally for free across the currency zone.  The text, a version of which was seen by CoinDesk two weeks ago, includes safeguards for privacy and financial stability, but many stakeholders are already questioning the benefits of the potential new central bank digital currency (CBDC).  In a Wednesday posting on the EU executive’s website, the commission’s Executive Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis argued the CBDC brought “strategic advantages.”  “A digital euro would also enhance the integrity and safety of the European payment system at a time when growing geopolitical tensions make us more vulnerable to attacks to our critical infrastructure,” be available “to everyone, everywhere, for free,” and could stimulate innovation and competition in a market dominated by a few major players, mostly from the U.S., said Dombrovskis in the post co-authored with European Central Bank’s (ECB) Executive Board Member Fabio Panetta.  At a Wednesday press conference to present the plans, European Commissioner Mairead McGuinness said she expected the debate over a digital euro to continue and intensify – but added she hoped the extra potential options a digital euro brings, such as its use in remote rural areas, could persuade skeptics.  “Somebody falling in love with digital currency is stretching it,” said McGuinness, the commission’s most senior financial services official, pulling a wad of banknotes out of her pocket. “It's easier to talk about cash because it's tangible.”  The law doesn’t bring the digital euro into being as such – since it’s the ECB that needs to decide whether to issue the CBDC. Officials argue the state-backed digital currency offers features private payment means aren’t always able to – allowing payments between friends and with higher data protection standards.  Yet despite years of technical work by the central bank, many remain nonplussed – including some of the lawmakers and governments who’d need to approve the commission’s new bill.  The initiative has also faced skepticism from commercial banks, for whom the state-backed currency represents competition to their own digital payments system, and potentially an alternative to savings accounts too.  “Alongside the main features of a digital euro, it is important to discuss the broader questions about its added value,” said Wim Mijs, chief executive officer of lobbying organization the European Banking Federation in a statement, arguing the digital euro would need firm limits on holdings and transactions to prevent deposits fleeing from banks.  In a statement published Wednesday, the ECB welcomed the commission's plans and confirmed it will decide in the fall whether to move to the next phase of its project.  “The euro is the most tangible symbol of European integration,” said ECB President Christine Lagarde in a statement to the press. ""We look forward to continuing working together with other EU institutions towards a digital euro to ensure our currency is fit for the digital age.”  The legal proposals seek to ensure the digital euro can be used offline, offering a level of privacy equivalent to that of cash. It forbids the CBDC from being “programmed” to limit the goods it can be used to buy, though officials say it could still be used to underpin conditional payments, such as a monthly payment for a utilities bill, or a more complex smart contract.

The new platform plans to expand its crypto asset offerings for retail and institutional investors throughout Europe. The raise was led by Valar Ventures, co-founded by billionaire entrepreneur Peter Thiel, and featured participation from MiddleGame Ventures, Speedinvest, Keyrock and Wintermute Ventures.  Bitpanda initially launched Bitpanda Pro in 2019 to provide a secure and regulated platform for retail traders, finance professionals and institutions. The company – which hit a $4.1 billion valuation during a funding round in Aug. 2021 – will retain an undisclosed minority stake in One Trading.  ""Since we first launched Bitpanda Pro, given its potential, we always knew and planned that its success would naturally make it evolve to become its own business,"" said Eric Demuth, CEO of Bitpanda, in a press release.  One Trading will continue to be led by Bitpanda Pro CEO Joshua Barraclough, who joined Bitpanda in late 2021 after a stint as co-head of digital innovation at JPMorgan in London. One Trading aims to offer complex crypto products such as derivatives and spot trading for both institutional and retail customers.  “We want to make crypto trading safe and accessible for all and bridge the gap to provide an institutional-grade platform for all customer types,” Barraclough said in the press release  To achieve this goal, One Trading has implemented significant infrastructure changes to launch a fast and scalable exchange where orders can be created and canceled in under 250 microseconds.

The SEC has not only focused on these exchanges but has also classified certain altcoins, including Cardano (ADA), as securities. Consequently, ADA has been directly affected by the recent scrutiny imposed by the SEC. In response to the SEC’s statements, the team behind Cardano has issued a statement expressing their disagreement with the regulatory body’s position. However, it appears that the consequences of the SEC scrutiny are starting to manifest. The latest reports indicate that specific Cardano trading pairs will be delisted from Huobi, a development that has very little impact on the price of ADA. Market Reaction And Impact On Cardano (ADA) Price Despite the recent news of specific ADA trading pairs being delisted, the market response has been relatively subdued. The current price of ADA on CoinGecko stands at $0.27, reflecting a decline of 1.8% in the past 24 hours. However, it is worth noting that this price movement cannot be solely attributed to the delisting announcement. Source: CoinMarketCap The removal of the ADA trading pair from Huobi has had a minimal impact on the overall price of the token. Despite concerns surrounding regulatory scrutiny and delisting actions, Cardano has managed to maintain a crucial price level. It demonstrates resilience in the face of adverse developments and suggests that market participants are not reacting significantly to the specific delisting news. ADA downhill price movement. Source: CoinMarketCap When considering the broader perspective, Cardano’s price decline of 0.9% over the past seven days is relatively marginal. This indicates that, despite the delisting news and regulatory scrutiny, the market sentiment towards ADA has remained relatively stable. Investors and traders have shown confidence in the token’s ability to withstand challenges and maintain its value, even in the face of negative developments. ADA market cap currently at $9.6 billion.

The reason provided by Huobi for this action is their dedication to improving the trading experience for users. However, it is important to note that trading ADA with USDT and Bitcoin (BTC) will remain unaffected. By considering the recent delisting by Huobi in the context of previous actions taken by the SEC, it becomes evident that ADA is dealing with a challenging regulatory landscape.

The Financial Institutions Division had earlier indicated that Prime Trust had a significant deficit on its books, alleging that it had lost access to several legacy crypto wallets in 2021. Prime Trust Holds A Fraction Of What Is Owed To Clients Prime Trust was previously a financial infrastructure provider for Binance US and several others. According to the receivership request filed in Nevada, Prime Trust owes its clients over $85 million in fiat but currently has only around $3 million available on hand. Furthermore, the company also owes its clients $69.5 million in crypto but holds around $68 million in crypto assets. The move by the Nevada Financial Institutions Division comes just days after BitGo called off its bid to acquire the embattled crypto firm. Furthermore, it also follows a cease-and-desist order filed by the state alleging that Prime Trust was on the verge of insolvency. The filing also added that the crypto custodian was operating with a $12 million equity deficit. According to the filing, at least some part of this shortfall comes from Prime Trust losing access to its legacy crypto wallets. The Fireblocks Agreement In 2020, Prime Trust entered into an agreement with Fireblocks, with the latter to manage its crypto assets. In 2021, Prime Trust’s new management set up “legacy wallet forwarding” for wallets that were earlier on the Fireblocks platform. After reverting back to legacy wallets in January 2021, the company discovered in December 2021 that it could not access its legacy wallets, losing access to all the cryptocurrencies held within them as well. It was alleged that while Prime Trust could not access these wallets, it allegedly used its clients’ fiat currency accounts to purchase crypto assets, which were used to process crypto-denominated withdrawals. The company’s efforts to access its legacy wallets have proven unsuccessful. The filing stated, “It is understood that from December 2021 to March 2022, to satisfy the withdrawals from the inaccessible Legacy Wallets, [Prime] purchased additional digital currency using customer money from its omnibus customer accounts. [Prime] is reported to have been making efforts to regain access to the Legacy Wallets. However, as of the date of this Petition, [Prime] has been unable to do so.” The filing also stated that the company’s financial condition could only worsen as customers withdraw their funds. According to Fireblocks communications head Gaby Hui, the legacy wallets in question are all controlled by Prime Trust, and no Fireblock funds are in limbo. “After Prime Trust became a Fireblocks customer, new management made a decision to deposit Prime Trust’s customer assets in old legacy wallets. Once management moved those assets to the legacy wallets, the customer assets were not recoverable. These legacy wallets were not Fireblocks wallets.” Prime Trust And FID Both Requested Receivership The filing also indicated that both Prime Trust and the Financial Institutions Division requested the receivership. It also asks for preliminary injunctive relief, stating that such relief would be in the public’s interest, given there is a threat of immediate, irreparable harm. A press release by a spokesperson for the Financial Institutions Division stated, “The petition asks the court to appoint a receiver to take over the day-to-day operations of the company and thoroughly examine all its finances to determine the best option to protect Prime’s clients, either by rehabilitating and returning the company to private management or by liquidating the company.” The filing has also asked for a ban on Prime Trust, along with its officers, directors, stakeholders, and others associated with the firm, from disposing of its assets or conducting transactions on behalf of the firm. In an affidavit signed by Nevada Commissioner Sandy O’Laughlin, both FID and Prime Trust agreed that Meadows Bank Director Paul Huygens, Bank of Nevada CEO John Guedry, or former Meadows Bank CEO Arvind Menon could be possible receivers.

The company released its latest collection on Tuesday, raking in $38 million in 15 minutes. Azuki Elementals was first teased last week at a holders-only event held in Las Vegas titled “Follow the Rabbit.”  Community reactions following the sale have a common thread: That some of the new NFTs look too similar to the Azuki collection, released in February 2022, despite Elementals initially having a different branding story.     “Azuki really sold a 20K collection at 2 ETH exclusively to their own holders extracting $40MM only for the art to be revealed as basically identical to the main collection,” tweeted Charlotte Fang, creator of the popular Milady NFT collection. “Bluechip bagholders in disbelief.”  A side-by-side comparison showed both collections displayed similar features, such as facial structure, angle and the general vibe, leading to some observers terming Elementals as a cheaper version of the main collection.  The similarities may have led to holders dumping the main Azuki collection and Elementals falling under their mint prices.  Analytics shows sales of Azuki NFTs increased almost 400% compared with last week, while prices fell from over 14 ether (ETH) to 9.7 ether in a single day. Elemental floor prices dropped 55% as presale buyers dumped the collection en masse.  Meanwhile, Azuki responded to the community backlash in Asian evening hours on Wednesday and seemingly accepted the shortcomings.  ""We hear you - the mint process was hectic, the PFPs feel similar and, even worse, dilutive to Azuki,"" developers tweeted. ""Our ambitious goals led to a new collection which confused the community on the tangible differences with the original Azuki collection.""  ""Azuki’s vision is to build a decentralized brand. Doing so requires great communication and execution, both of which were lacking with the Elementals sale. We know that we lost a piece of trust today, but nothing gets us more motivated to make things right,"" they added.",NEGATIVE,ETH,ETH | MARKET,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/06/28/azuki-nft-prices-slide-44-after-creator-releases-basically-identical-elementals,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7037a7939a75538936c73be5c7b4e730ae049575-1436x957.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

SEC: Deaton Predicts New Verdict Date, But XRP Price Loses Steam","The XRP community continues to eagerly await a ruling in the legal battle between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). So far, all speculations about a supposed end date have been wrong. The judge in charge, Analisa Torres, is taking more time for her ruling than many legal experts predicted based on previous proceedings. However, this does not stop lawyer John E. Deaton, who is representing the XRP army in the legal case as amicus curiae, from making a new prediction. In the latest CryptoLaw broadcast, lawyer Deaton speculated that Judge Torres will issue the summary judgment on September 6, 2023. Ripple Vs. SEC: Why September 6 Might Be The End Date In the live stream, the lawyer explains that he has tried to give a prediction for a verdict date several times in the past. For this, he looked at Judge Torres’ previous proceedings. The finding was that Torres ruled at different speeds once the Daubert/expert motions were decided: sometimes it was on the same day, in other cases it was after two, four and six months respectively. Related Reading: XRP Traders Show Capitulation, Why This Could Be Bullish Based on this, Deaton made the prediction that Judge Torres will rule on May 6, by early June at the latest (the average: three months). As a reminder, Torres ruled on the Daubert motions in the case between Ripple and the SEC on March 6 this year. Now that those deadlines have passed, Deaton came up with a new prediction: according to the lawyer, Judge Torres will issue a summary judgment after the full six months, on September 6 this year. As Deaton also pointed out, the length of the litigation between Ripple and the SEC is within the usual range so far and does not take longer than other cases. In another comment, Deaton noted that Judge Torres may delay the ruling because she understands the importance of the SEC v. Ripple case. She knows that thousands of people, including the appellate courts, will be reviewing her summary judgment decision in the Ripple case. She also has a staggering 500 open cases to decide, 44 of which are criminal cases. Ripple: Waiting on a Decision https://t.co/ty0LG3AASV — CryptoLaw (@CryptoLawUS) June 27, 2023 XRP Price Loses Steam The delay of the ruling in the legal battle between Ripple and the SEC seems to have upset XRP investors. A look at the 1-day chart of XRP shows that the price is in a descending trend channel after the price failed to break above the resistance at $0.50 in the higher time frames over the past two weeks. Related Reading: Ripple Emails Reveal: XRP Buybacks Were On The Table To Prop Up Price A breakout from the trend channel is crucial to make a new run towards resistance at $0.50.

42420064,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUX8ST,1687938788,‘End the Extortion:’ BlockFi Creditors File to Liquidate Estate,"Creditors of defunct crypto lender BlockFi have filed to liquidate the company, accusing management, including CEO Zac Prince, of “fraud,” “extortion” and “mischief” in delaying resolution of bankruptcy proceedings.  The company is holding the case up so it can negotiate legal releases for its senior management, who are culpable for loans made to FTX’s Alameda Research, a committee representing BlockFi’s unsecured creditors said in a document filed in the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court late Tuesday evening.  “It is time to end all of this,” the creditors’ filing said, adding that, unlike other cases of alleged crypto wrongdoing, such as Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX, “BlockFi customers do not yet know their story, and this is facilitating case mischief … It is time for the court to order an end to the burn and, thereby, end the extortion tactics.”  The creditors refer to an investigative report into activities at the company, previously filed under seal, which they say “reveals, in great detail, that BlockFi (Mr. Prince in particular) perpetrated a fraud on customers.”  “The mediation is over; negotiations are over,” the filing said, arguing that BlockFi was taking unfair advantage of its legal monopoly on proposing a way out of bankruptcy. “This case is a liquidation. There is no revenue.”  With administrative costs of $16 million per month, “the Debtors continue paying, among other things, the salaries to more than 100 individuals – many of whom, to the best of our knowledge, have had little to do but work on their golf game,” the filing said.  In parallel with the creditors’ filing, BlockFi filed an updated plan under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code. An amended disclosure statement suggests that holders of BlockFi interest accounts, collectively owed around $1 billion, can expect to recover between 39% and 100% of their assets under the bankruptcy plan, as against 36%-60% if assets are merely liquidated.

BlackRock had recently submitted its own spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund on the 15th of June, sparking considerable interest from other asset managers. Fidelity Preparing Bitcoin ETF Filing As Race Heats Up With its spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund, Fidelity will join a growing list of institutions that are competing to be the first to introduce and get approval for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund. The filing sees Fidelity follow BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, in filing for an ETF. According to reports, Fidelity’s application could be filed as soon as this week and would be Fidelity’s second attempt at launching a spot bitcoin ETF. Fidelity also filed an application in 2022 but failed to get approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Over the past couple of weeks, several asset managers, such as Invesco (IVS.N), WisdomTree (WT.N), Bitwise, VacEck, and the already mentioned BlackRock, have filed applications with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a spot Bitcoin ETF. As a result of the applications, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) has also seen a considerable increase, rising to a one-year high of over $31,000 on the 23rd of June. Fidelity is a prominent player in the financial space, with over $11 trillion in assets under management. Additionally, it has been involved with the crypto ecosystem since 2018, operating trading and institutional custody services. It has also offered fund products to its European clientele since February 2022 through Fidelity International. A Game-Changing Development According to market experts, the potential launch of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund could be a game-changing development, giving investors exposure to the crypto market without requiring them to acquire or hold the underlying asset. BlackRock’s filing for an ETF has aroused considerable interest in bitcoin ETFs once again, given the firm’s significance, size, and standing. According to senior market analyst at Oanda, Edward Moya, there is considerable optimism in the markets at present. “There’s a lot of optimism here that you’re going to get a bitcoin ETF. If that does get done, it could open the door for much more institutional money and probably some high-net-worth retail traders to get back into crypto.” Will The SEC Change Its Stance? The Securities and Exchange Commission has allowed Futures-based bitcoin ETFs since October 2021. These track the price of bitcoin futures contracts. However, when it comes to spot bitcoin ETFs, the Securities and Exchange Commission has rejected several applications. Spot bitcoin ETFs are publicly traded investment vehicles that track the price of Bitcoin, stating that it had concerns that the underlying markets could be manipulated. However, many feel that BlackRock applying for a spot bitcoin ETF could be a game changer because the asset manager files for ETFs only when it knows it can get them approved. The filing has also helped to reverse the negative perception of Bitcoin and the larger cryptocurrency markets to some degree. According to Alex Adelman from the crypto rewards fund Lolli, the recent spot ETF filings could act as a vote of confidence for the larger crypto ecosystem. “Institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity provide the expertise and custodial services top retailers rely on to serve global consumers.” The crypto markets have been rattled by a series of adverse events and shutdowns, the most prominent being the collapse of FTX, which authorities alleged was running a multi-billion dollar fraud. More recently, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Binance and Coinbase, alleging that both violated several rules, an accusation both entities deny. The SEC itself has come under legal troubles, with Grayscale Investments suing the regulator over its rejection of Grayscale’s application to convert its flagship Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. The case hinges on the fact that the Securities and Exchange Commission having previously approved certain surveillance agreements to prevent fraud in bitcoin futures-based ETFs. Grayscale has argued that the same should apply to its spot fund. BlackRock’s Filing BlackRock filed its spot bitcoin ETF application on the 15th of June, 2023. According to the filing by the Nasdaq stock exchange with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Coinbase Custody Trust Company will be the custodian of the fund’s Bitcoin holdings, while the Bank of New York Mellon will be the custodian of the fund’s fiat currency. If approved, BlackRock’s ETF will be the first crypto spot ETF in the United States of America. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Miners also reduced reserve holdings by 8,000 BTC in their reserves in which only a small portion was sent to spot trading exchanges, the firm added.  “This could signal that miners may be using their newly minted coins as collateral in derivatives trading activities,” CryptoQuant analysts said. “A good example of this type of trading is known as ""hedging"", which uses bets in the opposite direction to market consensus.”  Bitcoin has risen nearly 20% in the past two weeks amid favorable catalysts such as spot Bitcoin ETF filings by a flurry of traditional finance companies and increased trading interest.  On-chain metrics have previously suggested bitcoin could already be in the early stages of a bull market – meaning Bitcoin-based businesses, such as miners, could already be taking steps to manage their reserves and holdings.  Meanwhile, the past few days saw $128 million worth of bitcoin rewards sent to crypto exchanges, an amount estimated to total 315% of daily mining revenues, as per on-chain analytics firm Glassnode. This was the largest-ever sent amount on record by this metric.

14274897,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=540052,1687935327,Kaching! Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Price Explodes Over 100% – What’s Powering It?,"Bitcoin Cash (BCH) recently experienced a remarkable surge, registering more than 100% increase. As one of the leading digital currencies, Bitcoin Cash has often been compared to its predecessor, Bitcoin (BTC), but it has also carved its own path in the ever-evolving crypto landscape. BCH, a cryptocurrency born out of a hard fork from Bitcoin in August 2017, shares the same underlying technology as its predecessor but aims to address some of the scalability issues that Bitcoin faced. With its larger block size and faster transaction times, Bitcoin Cash aimed to become a more efficient and accessible form of digital currency. However, it has faced its fair share of scrutiny and volatility over the years. Now, with its recent meteoric rise, the question on everyone’s mind is: What factors are driving this surge in Bitcoin Cash’s price, and what does it mean for the future of this digital asset? Bitcoin Cash Emerges As Top Performer Bitcoin Cash BCH has exhibited an exceptional performance, positioning itself as one of the leading performers over both short and long timeframes. Over the past seven days, BCH has shown an impressive surge, soaring by a remarkable 106.3%. Source: Coingecko Even in the past 24 hours, it remains a top contender with a gain of 2.8%, defying the prevailing sentiment of stagnation observed in recent days. The current trading price for BCH, according to CoinGecko, stands at $226.69, further solidifying its upward trajectory. Meanwhile, Bitcoin, the flagship cryptocurrency, experienced a significant breakthrough by surpassing the $30,000 mark with remarkable momentum, briefly breaching the $31,000 threshold before the start of the weekend. BCH market cap currently at $4.5 billion. Chart: TradingView.com However, the bullish momentum was unable to sustain itself, leading to a resurgence of selling pressure and subsequently pushing the price back towards the $30,000 level. At the time of writing, the primary cryptocurrency is trading around $30,444, reflecting a meager setback in its upward trajectory. Factors Driving BCH Price Surge Recent developments have shed light on the factors driving the impressive surge in the price of Bitcoin Cash (BCH). According to a new BCH price report, the launch of EDX Markets, a cryptocurrency exchange backed by industry giants Citadel Securities, Charles Schwab Corp., and Fidelity Digital Assets, has significantly benefited BCH. EDX Markets will offer trading services for various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin Cash, providing increased accessibility and liquidity for BCH investors. Bitcoin Cash price trajectory in the last seven days. Source: CoinMarketCap Furthermore, another significant catalyst for the surge of the crypto’s price can be attributed to its recent game-changing upgrade. In May, Bitcoin Cash underwent a network hard fork that not only enhanced the network’s security and privacy measures but also introduced plans for CashTokens. This innovative feature holds immense potential for building decentralized applications (dApps) on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain, opening up new possibilities and driving increased adoption.

It was the first time any agency seized cryptocurrency from Hezbollah and Iran's Quds Force, Chainalysis said on Tuesday.  The seizure of the crypto wallets came after Defense Minister Yoav Gallant approved the move several weeks ago, according to a government communique. The effort involved Israel's Mossad spy agency, its military intelligence office, the Israeli police and others.  ""This is the first event of this magnitude in which an infrastructure headed by Hezbollah and the Iranian Quds Force that transferred millions of dollars for use by terrorist elements was thwarted,"" Galant said while speaking at the third crypto conference of the National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing in Israel's Ministry of Defense.  As many as 40 addresses were on the seizure list and all of the funds were in USDT on the TRON network (USDT-TRON), Chainalysis said. The pattern reflected that funds were moved first from financial facilitators to hawala services and OTC brokers, and then to Hezbollah-controlled addresses at mainstream exchanges.  Iran’s mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CoinDesk.  In May, Israeli authorities seized roughly 190 Binance accounts with alleged ties to terrorist groups such as Hamas and Daesh since 2021, according to Reuters.

At press time, the TUSD/USDT pair traded at 89 cents on Binance.US, having hit a low of 80 cents on Wednesday, data from charting platform TradingView show. On Binance, the pair traded at around $0.9980.  Volatility in stablecoins, which have evolved as funding currencies over the past three years, often feeds into the broader market. So far, TUSD's volatility has not impacted the broader market, with bitcoin (BTC) continuing to trade in familiar ranges above $30,000.  TUSD, with a market cap of $3 billion, poses less of a systemic risk to the broader market than tether, whose market cap is $83 billion.  According to pseudonymous market observer Parrot Capital, TUSD is getting hammered amid low volumes.  TUSD's downside volatility on Binance.US comes hours after the token's reserve report showed the project held $26,000 in assets backing the stablecoin at a U.S. depository institution that was ordered to halt withdrawals.  The attestation for the reserve report was provided by The Network Firm, a rebranded outlet of former FTX auditor Armanino. That has raised alarm bells on Crypto Twitter about the lack of system of checks and balances in the crypto industry.  ""Wait, the auditor who has been attesting to the $TUSD audits (in Prime Trust) was the old FTX auditor who set up under a new name after the FTX scandal?!?!?

Summary Overview The Law Commission recommends: First-ever Government-commissioned common law analysis showing how the law in England and Wales can accommodate digital assets, like NFTs and crypto-tokens. Law Commission report advocates for common law reform and development to provide greater clarity to users and attract technological innovation. Recommendation for legislation to confirm the existence of a distinct category of personal property which can acknowledge the unique features of digital assets. The Law Commission of England and Wales has today (Wednesday, 28 June) published recommendations for the reform and development of the law relating to digital assets. Digital assets – which include crypto-tokens (sometimes referred to as ‘cryptocurrencies’) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) – are used for an increasing variety of purposes in modern society, such as for investment, for making payments, and for linking to or embodying debt and equity securities. Over the last 15 years, personal property law in England and Wales has proven sufficiently flexible to accommodate digital assets. However, as the digital asset market and related technology continue to change, there remains some residual legal uncertainty and complexity. The Government therefore asked the Law Commission to carry out a first-ever rigorous common law analysis, showing how the law in England and Wales can respond to this kind of emerging technology. The Commission’s recommendations for reform and development of the law aim to provide a comprehensive legal foundation for digital assets which will allow these new technologies to flourish, enabling a diverse range of market participants to interact with and benefit from them. UK Law is Well Suited to Accommodate Crypto In its report, the Commission shows that the common law of England and Wales is well placed to provide a coherent and globally relevant regime for existing and new types of digital asset. Because digital assets are not tangible and differ significantly from physical assets, and from rights-based assets like debts and financial securities, they do not fit within traditional categories of personal property. Nonetheless, the Commission argues that the flexibility of common law can accommodate a distinct category of personal property to better recognise and protect their unique features. The Commission also recommends legislation to confirm the existence of this category and remove any uncertainty. To ensure that courts can respond sensitively to the complexity of emerging technology, the Commission calls on Government to create a panel of industry experts who can provide guidance on technical and legal issues relating to the control of digital assets. The Commission also makes recommendations to provide market participants with legal tools that do not yet exist in England and Wales, such as new ways to take security over crypto-tokens and tokenised securities. The Commission’s recommendations for reform and common law development aim to create a clear and consistent framework for digital assets that will provide greater clarity and security to users and market participants. The recommendations also support the Government’s goal of attracting technological development to cement the position of England and Wales as a global hub for crypto-tokens and crypto-assets. Professor Sarah Green, Law Commissioner for Commercial and Common Law, said: “The use and importance of digital assets has grown significantly in the law few years. The flexibility of the common law means that the legal system in England and Wales is well placed to adapt to this rapid growth. Our recommendations for reform and development of the law therefore seek to solidify the legal foundation for digital assets. We also aim to ensure that the private law in England and Wales remains a dynamic, globally competitive and flexible tool that enables further technological innovation.” Justice Minister Mike Freer commented: “The UK is a world leader in legal innovation and these findings demonstrate the strength of English and Welsh law in responding to the fast-paced changes caused by emerging technologies in the law sector. We must ensure our law remains equipped to meet the complexities of these technologies well into the future, and we will carefully consider these findings as we look to further strengthen the future of our globally-renowned legal system.” Andrew Griffith, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, added: “Our reputation for straight dealing, use of the English language and flexible common law attracts business across the world. This, combined with our straightforward approach to regulating crypto-assets puts the UK at the vanguard of innovation to drive growth in digital assets and boost our economy. I firmly welcome the Law Commission’s Final Report on Digital Assets and the work done to meet the complexities of these technologies well into the future – and will carefully consider their findings and recommendations.” The Law Commission’s recommendations for reform of the law on digital assets are as follows: Legislation to confirm the existence of a distinct third category of personal property under the law which can better recognise, accommodate and protect the unique features of digital assets. The report does not set out clear boundaries for this third category, arguing instead that common law is the best vehicle to determine which objects can fit within it. This will allow for a nuanced approach to recognising that things such as crypto-tokens, export quotas or different types of carbon emissions allowance can be objects of personal property rights. Creation of a panel of industry-specific technical experts, legal practitioners, academics and judges to provide non-binding advice to courts on complex legal issues relating to digital assets. Creation of a bespoke legal framework that better facilitates the entering into, operation and enforcement of collateral arrangements relating to crypto-tokens and crypto-assets. Statutory law reform to clarify whether certain digital assets fall within the scope of the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No 2) Regulations 2003. What Is A Digital Asset? Digital asset is a broad term which covers a variety of non-tangible assets in digital form. These can include digital files, email accounts, domain names, and crypto-tokens, including cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The technology used to create these assets and the characteristics of each asset can vary greatly. What Is A Crypto-Token? A crypto-token is a type of digital asset that uses cryptography – the process of coding information so that it can be transferred securely. Crypto-tokens are digital tokens that can be traded, used to record, embody or link to another asset or legal right, or used as a store of value. One type of crypto-token is a non-fungible token (NFT), which is a crypto-token that is unique or capable of being differentiated from other crypto-tokens. NFTs are often linked to data, such as data representing digital artwork, but they can also be used to link to a wide range of assets and rights. The term “crypto-token” is sometimes used interchangeably with “cryptocurrency”. While they have many overlapping features, cryptocurrency is a term that generally refers to crypto-tokens that are largely intended to be used for making payments as digital currencies, while crypto-tokens are used for this and a number of additional purposes, outlined above. The law treats crypto-tokens, NFTs and cryptocurrency as things that exist through the combination of the active operation of software by a network of participants and specific data used by that software and network. Next Steps It is now for the Government to decide whether it intends to take the commission’s recommendations forward. An embargoed summary of the digital assets report is available here. The full report will be published on this page of the Law Commission website on Wednesday 28 June. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

As CoinDesk reported in March, The Network Firm was born out of accounting firm Armanino’s digital-asset practice.  Armanino stopped conducting crypto audits last year, underscoring the increasing difficulty for crypto firms to secure audits and reserve attestations from prominent accounting firms, with Mazars also halting proof-of-reserves work for crypto clients.  FTX was criticized for its lack of internal controls, with John Ray III, its new CEO appointed for bankruptcy proceedings, saying it “did not keep appropriate books and records or security controls”  ""Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here,"" Ray said in a November court filing.  Armanino’s audit for 2021 did not provide an opinion on the FTX.US or FTX Trading internal controls over accounting and financial reporting.  CoinDesk previously reported that in 2019, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board highlighted deficiencies in Armanino's quality-control processes, and the firm later faced controversy for its audit of Lottery.com, which overstated its cash balance by $30 million and improperly recognized revenue, leading to Armanino's resignation in September before a class-action lawsuit against Lottery.com's executives.  Executives at Archblock, which supports the TrueUSD stablecoin, have previously endorsed the Armanio team in prior emails to CoinDesk and said they would continue to use The Network Firm.  “The firm may be new, but the partners have been working in the industry for a long time, and many of the team members were part of the initial attestation engine,” Archblock’s Chief Financial Officer Alex de Lorraine previously told CoinDesk.  TrueUSD didn't immediately respond to a further request for comment.  The stablecoin issuer is currently trying to shore up confidence in its stablecoin, which has de-pegged, as it reiterates that its exposure to Prime Trust – which has been placed into receivership by authorities in Nevada – is limited.

Some of the firm’s highest-paid partners are charging upwards of $2,000 an hour for their work on the case, while some billed hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees for the month.  George W. Hicks Jr., P.C, one of Kirkland & Ellis’ litigation partners, billed $153,211 in fees across 87.8 hours of work, while Nicholas Adzima, an associate, billed 118 hours and totaled $147,906 in compensation for the month.

It’s representing a number of crypto companies in restructuring that fell into Chapter 11 during the bear market of 2022, including Celsius and BlockFi.  The series of bankruptcies brought on by the 2022 bear market has been a bull market for law firms. As CoinDesk previously reported, FTX’s bankruptcy fees have already topped $200 million, while Celsius has already racked up over $50 million in fees in its proceedings.  Some critics have pointed out that the long processes and high legal fees mean that creditors lose out as the dwindling pot of money is eaten up by attorney fees.

42393254,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhIMlJ,1687929735,EU’s Controversial Smart Contract Kill-Switch Rules Finalized by Negotiators,"Legislative negotiators from the European Union have agreed on new rules known as the Data Act – after the Web3 community raised fears that its provisions on smart contracts could kill the sector.  The plans – made as part of a wider overhaul of data rules governing internet-connected appliances – have caused consternation in the Web3 sector for their vague scope and potentially fatal impact on decentralized transactions governed by immutable code.  The deal was confirmed by the European Commission's Thierry Breton in a tweet sent late overnight between Tuesday and Wednesday European time. The legislation is a ""milestone in reshaping the digital space"" that will lead to a ""thriving data economy that is innovative & open — on our conditions,"" said Breton, who is Commissioner for the EU's internal market.  While no final legal draft of the deal has yet been released, negotiators have told CoinDesk that the text on smart contracts was tightened up from original plans, which are intended to give people more rights over any data produced about them.  “With the adjustments made to the text we are no longer addressing smart contracts in general but make this regulation applicable specifically to the execution of contractual clauses in the context of data sharing,” Damian Boeselager, a lawmaker who led negotiations for the European Parliament’s Green grouping, told CoinDesk.  That suggests some improvements to a proposal the European Commission made in 2022, which said automated programs linked to the exchange of data should include kill switches that allow them to be safely terminated.  But another source briefed on the talks told CoinDesk that the final agreed version of the law still refers to “smart contracts,” rather than alternative formulations proposed by the industry such as “digital contracts.”  The commission has brushed off blockchain industry fears, saying the new law won’t kill off existing smart contracts, and that the high-level requirements it contains shouldn't be problematic for vendors in practice.  But it’s not clear that the final deal will assuage concerns that the measures will prove unworkable for public, permissionless blockchains, where there’s no central actor to implement regulatory strictures.  A recent open letter signed by organizations linked to numerous blockchains, including Stellar, Polygon , NEAR and Cardano, argued the Data Act could conflict with the recently agreed Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation.  MiCA, set to take effect in 2024, offers a license to crypto exchanges and wallet providers to operate across the bloc, but policymakers deliberately left out the more complicated topic of how to regulate decentralized finance, which the commission will have to return to in a few years’ time.  For the Data Act to pass into law, the European Parliament and Council, representing the bloc’s 27 member states, must vote in favor of the text agreed by negotiators.",NEGATIVE,없음,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/28/eus-controversial-smart-contract-kill-switch-rules-finalized-by-negotiators,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4b17516d28fa0ea2e3e6ba6106d99bfaee078645-1280x958.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

14271156,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=539833,1687926079,Monero (XMR) Higher 13 Days In A Row: What’s Next?,"An altcoin with a long and storied history, Monero is currently running to the upside in a way it never has before. After closing higher for twelve consecutive days – a new record for the privacy-focused altcoin – Monero looks poised to once again make history with a thirteenth straight higher close. What’s happened after other Monero winning streaks in the past? Let’s take a closer look at the price history to find out. Monero Win Streak Making History Monero’s current winning streak of twelve consecutively higher closes breaks the previous record set in 2021 of ten straight higher closes. While the price advance is clearly impressive, its unprecedented nature means we’ll have to look at earlier and shorter win streaks to get an understanding of what might be ahead for Monero in the future. In other words, we’ll use the prior shorter historical win streaks to generate enough occurrences to make a more statistically meaningful conclusion. Monero 2023 Winning Streak | XMRUSD on TradingView.com Monero 2021 Winning Streak | XMRUSD on TradingView.com Related Reading: After Raising $3M, HedgeUp (HDUP) Receives Influx of Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Monero (XMR) Investors Because the number of occurrences varies based on holding time, we’ll start by listing the number of times that six straight higher closes has happened next to our several hypothetical hold times of 7 days through 365 days. Holding time is defined as the amount of time one held the asset before exiting. For example, if one hypothetically purchased Monero following the trigger event (i.e., 6 straight higher closes) and sold it 30 days later, this would be a holding time of 30 days. Monero Occurrences of Six Consecutive Higher Closes by Holding Time (May 2014 – Present) 12 occurrences using a 7-day hold time 12 occurrences using a 15-day hold time 12 occurrences using a 30-day hold time 11 occurrences using a 60-day hold time 11 occurrences using a 90-day hold time 7 occurrences using a 180-day hold time 5 occurrences using a 356-day hold time While the number of occurrences remains limited even with the shorter win streak, past Monero winning streaks of six consecutively higher closes provides enough data to examine so let’s dive into the analysis. Past Monero Win Streaks Suggest More Strength Ahead The hypothetical average trade results for Monero (XMR) show a consistent positive edge across all holding times from 7 days through one year. Please note that even though the average historical trade results are positive for each hold time we examine, losses have also occurred for each hold time. Monero Hold Time Results for Six Straight Higher Closes | SOURCE: Tableau Going out to a roughly three-month hold time, the past win streaks have delivered far greater gains on average, with an average trade of +65.1% with a 90-day hold, +121.7% with a 180-day hold, to an impressive +373.8% with a 365-day hold. Related Reading: Solana (SOL), Monero (XMR), and DigiToads (TOADS) Form an Unbeatable Trio for Crypto Investors While we’ve certainly never seen a streak of consecutively higher closes to match the current twelve and nearly thirteen, Monero’s long price history suggests that more strength could be ahead, especially going out to three months and beyond.

14269117,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=540020,1687921257,"Bitcoin Price Struggles As Bears Attempt To Drive It Below $30,000","Bitcoin (BTC) failed to break through the $31,500 resistance level and has since retreated to a range between $30,300 and $30,800 in the past few days. The cryptocurrency has also been unable to reclaim the $31,000 territory, leading some to believe that Bitcoin bears may still have the upper hand. Despite recent signs of strength, Bitcoin’s inability to overcome key resistance levels has left many investors wary. The digital currency’s failure to break out of its current range suggests that it may be vulnerable to further losses in the short term. Liquidity Grab Sends Bitcoin Tumbling Bitcoin has been on a remarkable run since June 15th, gaining 25% in nine days. However, according to crypto analyst Justin Bennet, recent price action suggests a pullback may be in order. BTC longs have piled into the rally, but as Bennet notes, Bitcoin doesn’t usually offer free rides for those late to the party. A pullback from current levels just above $30,000 would make sense, and the price action on the 8-hour time frame looks very similar to the April swing high. Related Reading: BLUR Up By 11% Following This Announcement Bitcoin closed above $30,400 on the 8-hour trend line in April, only to close below it within the next few candles. While BTC has held up better this time, the 4-hour time frame has already broken below $30,400. The next few 8-hour candles will confirm whether this breakdown is sustained. If so, Bennet believes a pullback into the $28,000 area to flush out late BTC longs seems likely. How the Bitcoin price action develops at $27,000-$28,000 if and when tested will determine where BTC trends in July. On the other hand, a sustained break above $31,000 would suggest that bulls remain in control and expose $32,500. Nevertheless, despite the uncertain market conditions, the current uptrend in Bitcoin is far from over as long as bulls do not lose the $30,000 line. Historical data suggests that if Bitcoin can consolidate and maintain this key level of support, there are many chances for it to continue to breach higher levels and mark new yearly highs. Conversely, the $29,500 support level will be the next floor to watch if Bitcoin succumbs to bearish pressure. A downside movement could continue if BTC drops below this level, potentially leading to a further decline toward the $27,300 line.

14266903,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=540012,1687915804,"Global Interest In Bitcoin Is Fast-Falling, What’s Happening?","According to Google Trends data, interest in Bitcoin is heading to historic lows as of June 27. In a screenshot shared by a Twitter user, organic searches related to “Bitcoin” have dropped in the last six months. Google Trends is a free tool that tracks how people search for specific terms or phrases on Google, the world’s largest search engine. Interest in a particular topic or asset can be ascertained in real time depending on the number of search terms. Currently, few users are searching for the term “Bitcoin.” Interest In Bitcoin Fast Falling Notably, BTC and crypto prices have steadily recovered after bears wiped gains last year. As an illustration, BTC is up roughly 87% when writing and trending at around 2023 highs. On the other hand, organic searches related to the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency are at multi-year lows, sharply falling in the first half of 2023. Related Reading: PEPE Coin Shines Among Top Gainers, Tallies 78% In Last Week Data from Google Trends show that interest in searches around Bitcoin is below 2018 levels and could drop lower, considering how fast the reading has been free-falling in the first half of the year. This “disinterest” in Bitcoin seemed to have been spilled over from the second half of 2022. In the first half of last year, searches temporarily expanded before dropping. Even so, at that time, Bitcoin search readings, according to Google Trends, were lower than that registered in 2021 when it was at record highs. Based on this development, there appears to be a direct correlation between sentiment and prices, as deduced from Google Trends data on Bitcoin. BTC prices peaked at over $69,000 in November 2021 after steadily rising from late 2019. Notably, prices more than doubled as they rallied below $10,000, breaking December 2017 highs of around $20,000 and soaring to new all-time highs of about $70,000 registered in Q4 2021. When prices roared, searches related to Bitcoin, Google Trends data shows, also rose. The inverse was observed in the past 19 months when prices contracted from all-time highs, dropping by over 70% to as lows as sub-$16,000 in November 2022. What Could Be The Cause? From the current BTC price action, there is a divergence between Google Trends data on Bitcoin and prices. While prices are rising, shaking off bears of Q4 2022 and the first half of Q1 2023, interest in Bitcoin is shrinking. This observation can be pinned on several factors, including increasing regulatory scrutiny of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in the United States and worldwide.

Initial resistance comes from the 34,000 level, and if we do see a bitcoin ETF approval, institutional momentum could take the rally as high as the $40,000 level,” he told CoinDesk. “Any major setbacks with a BlackRock ETF rejection and a Grayscale defeat could temporarily kill the rally, but optimism will still remain that the ETF will eventually get done.”  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Stellar XLM +12.2% Smart Contract Platform Cosmos ATOM +2.1% Smart Contract Platform Chainlink LINK +1.2% Computing  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Terra LUNA −2.2% Smart Contract Platform Gala GALA −1.3% Entertainment Loopring LRC −0.7% Smart Contract Platform  Insights  Singapore: The Center of Asian Crypto Wealth Is Ready for a Reset  Known for governmental efficiency, the city-state of Singapore scored highest overall for the three measures it could control: regulatory structure (35% of the total score and included in the drivers category), digital infrastructure (12%) and ease of doing business (10%), which are both part of the enablers category. That was enough to be firmly ensconced in second place despite middling scores for quality of life – due to a very high cost of living – and per-capita crypto jobs, companies and events, which comprise the opportunities category.  For more on the criteria and how we weighted them, see: How We Ranked CoinDesk’s Crypto Hubs 2023: Our Methodology.  Despite the crypto industry’s well-earned reputation as the Wild West, crypto founders tend to prioritize predictability and clear regulations when shopping for a place to incorporate. That’s why the well-regulated, efficiently governed city-state of Singapore hosts the headquarters or satellites of some of the biggest brands in crypto, including Binance, Coinbase and Crypto.com. But after the spectacular failures of its homegrown darlings Terraform Labs and Three Arrows Capital plunged the ecosystem into Crypto Winter, Singapore’s crypto community is licking its wounds – and beginning to look to the future.  Singapore still has a strong reputation: it received the most mentions for best crypto hub in a select CoinDesk survey sent to about three dozen globetrotting crypto professionals this spring. The Red Dot has all the ingredients of a strong crypto hub, with the highest rating in the world for digital infrastructure (as measured by the Tufts/Fletcher Digital Evolution Index) and second-highest ranking in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business index.  It is the most competitive fintech hub in the Asia Pacific region, according to the 2023 Global Financial Centres Index, edging out Hong Kong, and a regulatory leader for crypto. In 2020, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) passed the Payment Services License Act. “There were all these companies that were all rushing to Singapore to apply for the license because it was actually the first regulator in the region that had a proper digital-assets licensing framework,” said Pamela Lee, head of APAC sales at Talos, developer of institutional-grade technology for digital-asset trading.  Read Crypto Hubs 2023: Where to Live Freely and Work Smart  Prakash Somosundram, founder of Enjinstarter, a blockchain-based crowdfunding platform for early crypto projects, described having had a “front row seat” to the Singaporean crypto scene since 2015. “In the early days, when it came to crypto, from a regulatory perspective, it was very pro. So this is where a lot of crypto influencers moved their capital,” Somosundram said. And with no capital gains tax, “It is an ideal place for the crypto affluent to actually come here.”  A highly educated workforce and institutional fintech know-how have been a potent mix for Singapore. Among the first initial coin offerings (ICO) were Singaporean startups such as cryptocurrency payment platform TenX, which raised $43 million in just seven minutes in 2017. That year, Singapore even surpassed the U.S. with $1.5 billion versus $1.2 billion in ICO funding, an astounding amount for a locale that is roughly the landmass of New York City, with just two-thirds of the population.

Cryptocurrencies are now firmly part of the global conversation; whether it be investors trading crypto, businesses accepting it as a mode of payment, or just reports about the latest surge or crash in the crypto market. And now, according to a new ConsenSys survey, an impressive 92% of people around the world are aware of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Developing Regions Show Strong Crypto Recognition According to a recent poll conducted by the private blockchain software company ConsenSys and YouGov, 92% of people worldwide are aware of cryptocurrencies. Over 15,158 people in 15 nations, with an average age of 18, were surveyed for the report. However, while awareness of crypto is high, understanding is low. A total of 92% of respondents to the survey had heard of crypto, but only 8% could confidently say they were familiar with the general concept of Web3. Related Reading: BLUR Up By 11% Following This Announcement Interestingly, developing regions of the world actually show some of the strongest recognition and interest in cryptocurrencies. Nigeria, South Africa, and Brazil lead in the pack in crypto awareness, with 99% of Nigerian respondents demonstrating awareness of crypto and over 70% accurately guessing the definition of a blockchain. While developed nations debate regulating crypto, developing regions seem more open to innovation. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have helped to address the inherent risks of unstable currencies leading to high inflation rates and the lack of financial infrastructure for money movement that many people face in developing nations. This stands in stark contrast to the larger level of mistrust toward cryptocurrency displayed by European nations and Asian nations like Japan and South Korea. In Japan and Indonesia, only 1 in 3 respondents claim to understand what cryptocurrency is.
