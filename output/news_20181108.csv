42402135,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3XFz,1541716220,Expect the SEC to Target More Token Exchanges After EtherDelta,"The Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) settlement with the founder of EtherDelta is likely the first of many enforcement actions to come against crypto token exchanges.  Until recently, the SEC's scrutiny of the cryptocurrency industry largely focused on projects and teams that raised money through initial coin offerings (ICOs) in possible violation of securities laws. But a person familiar with the SEC's thinking told CoinDesk Thursday that crypto trading platforms have become a significant priority for the agency's enforcement division.  As such, the news that the SEC had charged EtherDelta founder Zachary Coburn with operating an unregistered securities exchange can be seen as a shot across the bow of token-trading platforms.  ""At this point, if you're doing an exchange of crypto assets, dealing with U.S. persons, you probably need to get either a no-action letter or get clarity from counsel about whether you are implicating securities laws,"" said Andrew Hinkes, an adjunct professor at the New York University School of Law.  And while the EtherDelta action was the SEC's first against a crypto exchange, Hinkes told CoinDesk:  ""I'm surprised it took this long.""  Further, the case shows that even if so-called decentralized exchanges (DEXs) cannot be easily shut down, that does mean no one will be held liable for their activities. Without admitting or denying the charges, Coburn agreed to pay a total of $388,000 in penalties, disgorgement and interest under the settlement.  ""This tells you that an exchange that used a distributed set of nodes instead of a centralized server isn't going to be treated any differently,"" Hinkes said. ""Just because you make it and then it gets operated by a decentralized network of others doesn't mean that any prospective responsibility or liability is gone. It's just possibly relocated.""  And notably, the action was taken against Coburn even though he left EtherDelta in late 2017. The trades of ethereum-based tokens on the platform cited by SEC took place between July 12, 2016 and December 17, 2017, around the time of his departure.  ""It doesn't matter whether you sell the business or operated it a year ago or a few years ago,"" said Preston Byrne, a partner at the law firm Byrne & Storm, P.C. ""American securities laws are going to be enforced.""  On the other hand, it's also telling that Coburn's penalty was merely a low-six-figure fine. He wasn't banned from participating in capital markets, in part because he cooperated with the SEC, which wants other individuals running or planning to run similar platforms to reach out to the agency first.  ""The entrepreneur, in this case, cooperated fully with the commission, which is often a good idea,"" Byrne said. ""It shows the SEC is willing to work with people who are willing to work with them.""  Decentralization is relative  Stepping back, since the token sale craze of 2017, numerous DEX platforms have emerged where ethereum-based assets are often swapped without oversight from any licensed entity.  According to DappRadar, the leading DEX platform IDEX had roughly 1,401 users over the past 24 hours. With regards to EtherDelta specifically, there were roughly 1,079 trades on EtherDelta over the past 24 hours, about 11 percent less than in the previous 24-hour period.  Although the SEC hasn't clarified which tokens that traded on EtherDelta it considered securities, this action hinted at who regulators consider liable for purportedly decentralized technologies.  Speaking of the SEC order and how it relates to the most popular form of ICO token, the ERC-20, Hinkes said:  ""It says that he [Coburn] founded a company, wrote and deployed the smart contract and exercised complete and sole control over the operations. Based on that, he should have known that his actions would contribute to the violation of the Exchange Act.""  In Hinkes' mind, this opens up a variety of legal questions for developers contributing to ethereum and bitcoin. It's entirely possible that merely writing and executing code could make technologists vulnerable to legal action in the future if they neglect to create limitations for how that software is used, he said.  ""EtherDelta could have elected to filter out certain tokens,"" Hinkes said. ""By not doing so, they opened themselves up for everything, including securities that are issued under ERC-20.""  Regardless of which specific tokens are eventually deemed by courts to be unregistered securities, Stephen Palley, a partner at the Washington, D.C.-based law firm Anderson Kill, told CoinDesk his reading of the order implies the majority of EtherDelta's volume came from ""the purchase and sale of unregistered securities.""  Fight or flight  From Byrne's point of view, the SEC's enforcement action could inspire more cryptocurrency companies to avoid having operations in the United States.  ""There are hubs overseas, Singapore, England, where the laws are much friendlier toward ICOs and tokens,"" Byrne said. ""The principal task of cryptocurrency entrepreneurs will be 'how do we maximize our opportunities in those jurisdictions while limiting our exposure to American regulators, and also compliance with American laws, as we conduct business overseas?'""  Meanwhile, the U.S.-based DEX startup AirSwap is strategizing for the opaque regulatory climate by partnering with licensed securities dealers and avoiding order books altogether.  ""Unlike other platforms, AirSwap doesn't engage in exchange activities–it has no order book, no order matching, and no transaction fees,"" AirSwap co-founder Michael Oved told CoinDesk. ""Our approach has been to be proactive in seeking advice and to be transparent with regulators.""  Several exchanges operating in the U.S., including AirSwap's rival Everbloom, avoid charging traders fees in an effort to reduce legal risks. Hinkes said this recent order may undercut such approaches.  ""It doesn't appear that taking a fee is relevant to their analysis of whether EtherDelta was acting as an exchange that should have registered or proceeded under an exemption, or not,"" Hinkes said.  This much is certain, the SEC is far from finished with its sweep of the industry, which Palley compared to a five-act play, saying:  ""They've got dozens and dozens of investigations going on. I think we'll see more press releases, more enforcement actions. This is certainly not the end of anything. This is maybe the end of Act 2 and the beginning of Act 3.""

Kim Hyun, president of the Korean Bar Association, was quoted as saying:  ""We urge the government to break away from negative perceptions and hesitation, and draw up bills to help develop the blockchain industry and prevent side effects involving cryptocurrencies.""  The government, however, will reportedly take a decision only after studying the technology thoroughly. It is currently examining the situation, alongside financial regulators in the country, according to the Reuters report.  In July, the Financial Services Commission (FSC), the country's financial watchdog, set up a new department dedicated primarily to cryptocurrencies and blockchain. Dubbed the Financial Innovation Bureau, it was created to focus on developing policy-making initiatives for the industry.  Also in July, a senior executive at the FSC called on the government to pass a bill regulating domestic cryptocurrency exchanges with urgency in order to counter lax security in the industry.  At the same time, members of a number of Korean political parties were reportedly expected to submit a number of bills focused on regulating cryptocurrencies, initial coin offerings and blockchain. So far, though, there has been no action on the part of the government.  The lack of clear rules is also causing domestic crypto exchanges to increasingly set up in outside jurisdictions, according to The Korea Times in a report today.

42402160,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3XIw,1541691102,SEC Charges EtherDelta Founder Over 'Unregistered Securities Exchange',"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has charged Zachary Coburn, the founder of crypto token trading platform EtherDelta, with operating an unregistered securities exchange.  The regulator said Thursday that EtherDelta, which acts as a secondary market for trading ERC-20 tokens, had been providing a marketplace for buyers and sellers to trade ethereum tokens that the SEC deemed to be ""digital asset securities."" It used an order book, an order display website and a smart contract built on ethereum, the agency said.  ""EtherDelta's smart contract was coded to validate the order messages, confirm the terms and conditions of orders, execute paired orders, and direct the distributed ledger to be updated to reflect a trade,"" the SEC said.  EtherDelta users conducted more than 3.6 million trades over an 18-month period ""for ERC-20 tokens, including tokens that are securities under the federal securities law,"" according to the release, which went on to add:  ""Almost all of the orders placed through EtherDelta's platform were traded after the Commission issued its 2017 DAO Report, which concluded that certain digital assets, such as DAO tokens, were securities and that platforms that offered trading of these digital asset securities would be subject to the SEC's requirement that exchanges register or operate pursuant to an exemption.""  The platform did not register as an exchange or file for an exemption, the SEC said.  SEC Division of Enforcement co-director Stephanie Avakian said in a statement that ""EtherDelta had both the user interface and underlying functionality of an online national securities exchange and was required to register with the SEC or qualify for an exemption.""  Coburn has already settled the charges, according to the release. Though he did not admit to or deny the charges, he paid $300,000 in disgorgement, $13,000 in pre-judgement interest and a $75,000 penalty.  The SEC noted that Coburn cooperated with the regulator, resulting in a lower penalty than may have otherwise been administered.

42402141,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3XRn,1541690139,Early Trading Shows Clear Preference In Divide Over Bitcoin Cash Fork,"An experimental market on a major crypto exchange suggests that bitcoin cash users may favor the more established version of the software, Bitcoin ABC, ahead of an expected fork this month.  Due to the technical design of the cryptocurrency, currently the fourth-largest by market capitalization, bitcoin cash users must ""hard fork"" the blockchain, or adopt a new software version with changes as decided by open-source developers, every six months.  Things are different this time around, though, amid the emergence of a rival version of the software called Bitcoin SV. As a result, anticipation has been growing that bitcoin cash (BCH) may undergo a divisive hard fork in which it splits into two competing cryptocurrencies.  That said, data from cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex, operated by Goldman Sachs-backed blockchain startup Circle, indicates Bitcoin ABC may be the preferred version. After launching markets meant to represent both versions of the software (including the as-yet-to-launch Bitcoin SV), Bitcoin ABC has a clear lead, trading at a price over four times higher.  Poloniex introduced ""pre-fork"" trading, at around 01:00 UTC today in an effort to retain a neutral stance during the upcoming Bitcoin Cash upgrade. The idea that theoretical markets can help users determine consensus around technical roadmaps has been raised before, and this is the latest version of an exchange seeking to play a role in supporting community decision-making.  By offering the pairs, the exchange is essentially allowing its customers to see which chain might be more widely supported, should both softwares be introduced.  What the charts show  Still, evidence indicates the debate may not be as divisive as feared.  As can be seen in the chart below, BCHABC is trading at a price of $465 (priced in USDC, the exchange's dollar-pegged stablecoin), which is 4.2 times higher the BCHSV's current price of $109 USDC at time of writing. For comparison, the price of BCH is currently $596 USDC on Poloniex.  Pre-fork trading has been live for roughly 12-hours and is only available to those willing to convert their BCH to either of the forks, so trading volumes are still small. That said, BCHABC is again leading the charge with twice twice trading volume of BCHSV.  At press time, $45,785 USDC and $21,988 USDC have been traded for BCHABC and BCHSV, respectively.  While the experimental markets are relatively illiquid, the price discovery can be expected to be particularly erratic until sufficient liquidity has established.  BCHABC and BCHSV deposits and withdraws will only be enabled once the actual Bitcoin Cash fork takes place on Nov. 15, even then there is no guarantee the forks will become ""economically or technically viable,"" Poloniex says.  The exchange warns:  ""You do not have to engage in pre-fork trading. If you choose to engage in pre-fork trading, please note that, as with all trading on the platform, trading in these assets can be extremely risky, and you trade at your own risk. It is possible that one of these chains will not be economically or technically viable after the fork, and its value will drop to zero.""

42402134,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3XLt,1541685600,"Crypto Exchanges Must 'Grow or Die,' Says Exec at Fintech Firm Cinnober","A financial technology company that was founded a full decade before the bitcoin white paper came out is looking to help today's cryptocurrency trading platforms mature.  Cinnober, based in Stockholm, mainly provides tech solutions to traditional stock and commodity exchanges around the world. But this year it's struck a handful of deals with crypto startups – most recently the Bitstamp exchange, which announced this week it will be the first in the space to use the vendor's TRADExpress platform, alongside the likes of the London Metal Exchange.  And it likely won't be the last crypto exchange to do so. Cinnober says it's looking for other potential partners in the market and sees around a dozen that would fit its criteria for selection: the biggest trading volumes and an effort to gear up for serving institutional investors.  ""The most suitable ones are those who are looking to participate in the transformation that the industry is going through,"" Eric Wall, Cinnober's cryptocurrency and blockchain lead, told CoinDesk. ""We can serve retail-only focused cryptocurrency exchanges, but the ideal customer for us is the one that is looking to cater more heavily to institutional investors.""  Getting institutional investors as clients will become crucial for cryptocurrency exchanges to survive, Wall believes, and it will require significant adjustments.  He added:  ""Cryptocurrency exchanges currently are extremely immature from the traditional financial markets perspective. Many of them lack basic knowledge of how to operate robust and reliable financial markets.""  'Grow or die'  In particular, to attract institutional investors, crypto exchanges should provide the same functionality as traditional stock and commodity exchanges do, Wall says, including trade compression, netting and clearing, so that cryptocurrencies can be traded like a typical financial asset.  Typically, crypto exchanges operate on pre-funded basis, only allowing users to trade as much as they have on their accounts, while traditional financial exchanges use cleared trades when customers maintain collateral deposited with a clearing house, and the outstanding trades are settled at the end of a trading cycle.  ""Right now the cryptocurrency exchange market is very inefficient as there are no clearing technologies and clearing houses in place,"" Wall explained. ""We can help a cryptocurrency exchange become a real exchange that has a clearing module, so trading is more efficient for institutional investors.""  This is what Cinnober is going to help Bitstamp with. To start, it will replace the exchange's matching engine, but ""in a later phase, we are looking to help Bitstamp to fit into the market structure that institutional traders expect and require,"" Wall said. In particular, Cinnober will allow Bitstamp to become a de facto clearing house for its own trades.  To be sure, Wall – who said he has been a customer of Bitstamp himself since 2013 – gives credit to crypto exchanges for their creativity and ability to function in a total regulatory uncertainty, making cryptocurrencies a tradable asset.  But now they should learn how to wed established financial market practices with cutting-edge technologies, and the choice for them is ""grow or die,"" Wall said.  Noting that Intercontinental Exchange (ICE, the parent of the New York Stock Exchange), Fidelity Investments, Citi and Goldman Sachs are expected to enter the market with trading and/or custody offerings, he said, ""in order for cryptocurrency exchanges to be competitive in that market, they would have to become more sophisticated.""  Early adopter  Stepping back, Cinnober has been exploring the crypto space since well before most of its buttoned-up core clientele probably even heard of bitcoin, much less took an interest in it.  According to Wall, as early as 2015, the company built a trading system for a Swedish startup called Cryex, but the exchange never went live because it couldn't get a banking license.  In October 2017, Cryex was acquired by another Swedish exchange, Safello, and it's not clear if it's going to use Cinnober's system, Wall said.  This year, however, Cinnober has brought a number of other solutions for the crypto industry online. In March, a Cinnober subsidiary called Irisium sold a market surveillance solution to Bitfinex. Then in July, the company partnered with BitGo to deliver a wallet solution for crypto exchanges. And last month, Cinnober announced a collaboration with GAP600, a startup enabling instant cryptocurrency transactions.  But Wall framed the Bitstamp deal as more than just another score for his company. Rather, he argued that adoption of institutional-grade technology by exchanges will help address the kind of concerns that have made regulators such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reticent to approve retail products like bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).  As he put it in a tweet Monday:  ""If there was ever any uncertainty from the SEC to approve a bitcoin ETF owing to exchange immaturity, this is a step forward to close that gap.""

According to a report from Hong Kong news outlet HK01 on Wednesday, Puman Middle School in Hunan province had been experiencing higher than normal noise levels from its computers over recent months, even on the holidays. The school's IT network had also significantly slowed, while electricity consumption had almost doubled from July to November.  The school's general manager had initially put the energy usage spike down to overuse of air conditioners, but an investigation revealed that that the school's principal, Lei Hua, and vice principal, Wang Zhipeng, had installed nine computers worth around $7,000 in total to mine the ethereum cryptocurrency, the report states.  HK01 indicates that the principal had initially set up the mining machines at his home, but was dismayed at the electricity costs incurred as a result. So, he installed the machines in a school dormitory and effectively stole the required power.  The school reportedly lost electricity to the value of $2,163, for which the principal has been punished and removed from his post at the school, as well as within the Communist Party. The vice principal was given a warning.  While no institution is likely to allow employees to use their facilities or power to mine cryptos, that hasn't stopped some from trying.  Back in March, a state employee at Florida's Department of Citrus was arrested for allegedly using official computers to mine cryptocurrencies. At the same time, Louisiana's attorney general was investigating a group of former staffers for the same offence.      And last year, a former employee of the Federal Reserve Board of Directors was fined $5,000 and put on probation after being caught mining bitcoin on a server owned by the U.S. central bank.

42402133,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3XJv,1541678385,"IBM, Seagate Team Up to Tackle Hard Drive Fakes With Blockchain","Global tech giant IBM is partnering with hardware manufacturer Seagate to ensure that computer hard drives are authentic using blockchain tech.  The companies announced Tuesday that they would be logging Seagate-produced drives on the IBM Blockchain Platform to block counterfeits from being utilized in data servers or otherwise distributed to end users expecting genuine products. The partnership will be used for drives intended for IBM servers to begin with.  Bruce Anderson, global managing director of IBM Electronics Industry, explained that Seagate has been a trusted supplier for IBM for several years and has provided hard drives for IBM to build into server platforms over that time. As the next stage in this partnership, the two companies will ensure every hard drive in a server can be traced back to its manufacturing point.  He explained:  ""If you look at when the drive enters the supply chain, when it gets built into servers, there's a lot of hands that it passes through, and after the servers get deployed there's quite a lot of folks who have access to the equipment. So ... the challenge becomes, 'are we dealing with an authentic piece of equipment or is this a substitution?'""  In order to verify drives, Seagate will now be including a physical marker on each drive that is produced, which will include an electronic key that is then stored on IBM's blockchain.  This key can be checked at any time to ensure that the product being sent down the supply chain is still the authentic drive that Seagate produced.  ""It's permissioned access to the blockchain, so Seagate folks – if they're being asked, 'is this an authentic part?' – they'll be able to verify that using the blockchain by checking the key on the drive, and an IBM service tech can [also check],"" he explained.  While IBM is contemplating allowing retail customers to also track drives using the platform, that functionality would not be implemented for at least a while.  That's largely because companies such as IBM would already be financially liable for the product anyway, and would therefore have the responsibility to ensure devices' authenticity, Anderson noted.  Beyond tracking Seagate drives, Anderson noted that utilizing a blockchain platform can improve supply chain processes in general by streamlining or eliminating paperwork.  ""This presents a great opportunity to take out a ton of manual administrative cost, or even just losses,"" he said.  As such, Anderson anticipates this type of platform being adopted ""very rapidly,"" given the size of the counterfeiting problem.  He cited a study by the International Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition, which projected that the total value of counterfeit or pirated goods globally in 2015 was more than $1.7 trillion.  To solve this issue, Anderson is of the opinion that the different companies in the industry need to cooperate, particularly for a solution such as a blockchain platform. IBM has already reached out to other manufacturers to gauge interest in utilizing a blockchain to track products, he said.  ""We've actually exposed the solution to a number of manufacturers, not only of drives, but other electronic equipment. Obviously folks are waiting for a standard to approach. The good news is the electronic industry is good at settling on a standard,"" he said.

Stepping back, the leading cryptocurrency picked up a strong bid at $6,200 on Oct. 31, keeping the crucial 21-month EMA support intact. Further, it witnessed a symmetrical triangle breakout earlier this week, suggesting that bulls had come out victorious in a tug of war with the bears.  The breakout had looked legitimate as the technical indicators turned increasingly bullish. In particular, the relative strength index rose to a three-month high of 59.00 yesterday, signaling strong bullish conditions.  As a result, BTC was expected to remain well bid above $6,500 and looked likely to rise to $6,800 in the near-term.  Instead, it fell back to $6,450 on Coinbase earlier today, invalidating the bullish higher lows and higher highs pattern, as seen in the chart below.  Hourly chart  The rising channel seen in the hourly chart has been breached to the downside, meaning the recovery rally from the Oct. 31 low of $6,201 likely ended at a high of $6,540 reached yesterday.  The stacking order of the 50-hour exponential moving average (EMA) above the 100-hour EMA, above the 200-hour EMA indicates the path of least resistance is still on the higher side. That bullish signal could soon weaken, though, as moving averages are lagging indicators.  While the channel breakdown has opened the doors for a deeper drop to $6,372 (horizontal support line), a bearish reversal would be confirmed only if BTC drops below 6,200 (Oct. 31 low).  Daily chart  Over on the daily chart, BTC bears may feel emboldened if prices drop below $6,200, negating the higher low pattern. That scenario seems unlikely with bitcoin's current lack of volatility, however.  Investors should keep an eye out for a strong bounce from the ascending (bullish) 10-day EMA, as that could recharge the engines for a rally to $6,800.  View  The immediate bullish outlook has been neutralized, courtesy of a rising channel breakdown on the hourly chart.  BTC may experience a deeper drop to the hourly chart support of $6,372. A violation there would expose the recent low of $6,200.  Wednesday's high of $6,540 is the level to beat for the bulls. A break above that level, if confirmed, could yield a rally to $6,800 (October high).  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42402126,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3XC3,1541671232,The Little-Known Ways Ethereum Reveals User Location Data,"""People don't realize how much information is out in the open.""  That's Peter Szilagyi, an ethereum core developer who manages the software client Geth, referring to the fact that little attention has been paid to the blockchain's underlying network layer, where information is sometimes exposed in complex and unpredictable ways.  Indeed, there's an awareness of the implications of such exposure, and it's given rise to an ongoing acceleration in research on how to better obscure user data at the application level, which sits on top of the ethereum blockchain, a transparent system that publishes smart contract and transaction data.  In an interview, Szilagyi described the peer-to-peer components that underlie the world's second-largest blockchain by market capitalization as a ""black magic thing.""  This state of affairs was highlighted during his talk at the annual developer conference, Devcon4, in Prague last week. Szilágyi detailed a number of concerns that could cause user metadata to leak out over time – and under the worst-case scenario, provide the basis for an accurate, global map of ethereum user locations.  During last Friday's talk, Szilagyi focused on two ways in which this could happen, with a focus on websites like popular blockchain explorer, Etherscan, and ""light clients"" such as mobile or browser-based apps.  ""When people are transitioning away from full nodes they are giving up certain guarantees and I just want to highlight what potential issues might arise,"" Szilagyi told CoinDesk.  Szilagyi began encountering the issues following his pursuit of a side project: an alternative to Facebook that is decentralized and private-by-default. As a result of the research, Szilagyi said metadata leaks make it difficult to interact anonymously with others.  ""We don't have that in ethereum,"" Szilagyi explained. ""The reason why these leaks began to bother me is because of that project.""  Speaking on Friday, Szilágyi said that many of the problems are so deeply ingrained that it's hard to address them without running the risk of breaking applications that run on top of ethereum. Still, the developer detailed methods that could alleviate the risk for users.  ""Most people in blockchain and ethereum they want to build on top, while there's a team at the bottom doing the dirty work,"" he told CoinDesk, adding:  ""It's not that they are unsolvable problems, but someone needs to understand that they exist.""  'Weird trackers'  During his Devcon talk, Szilágyi broke down the various ways in which sensitive user information can be exposed by interacting with ethereum. Taking the example of Etherscan, Szilagyi said that a particular combination is revealed to the website when users access it – namely, a link between a user's IP address and their ethereum address.  And that's notable because, as a unique computer identification number, an IP address reveals user location data.  This information is then shared with Google Analytics and Etherscan. Plus, Etherscan's underlying comment tool – a popular website comment add-on named Disqus – also receives this info, and further shares that activity with its partners.  ""Disqus actually reveals the IP-to-ethereum address mapping to Facebook, Twitter and Google Plus,"" Szilagyi said.  Disqus has 11 such integrations in total, such as YouTube, Vimeo and other services, that are given this information as well. The tool also contains other ""weird trackers,"" Szilágyi explained, including artificial intelligence platforms and data marketplaces.  And that's notable because it doesn't just impact Etherscan, but any decentralized application (dapp) that uses the same tools.  ""This is an issue because you are essentially associating your IP-to-ethereum address mapping and you're revealing that to a whole lot of services,"" Szilagyi continued.  Etherscan has taken measures to remove these features, Szilagyi said. Currently, it uses Google Analytics, but the team behind it is looking to remove that aspect from the website. Once having relied on an external ad company, Etherscan is taking steps to internalize the ad network as well.  But other dapps that are affected may not be as proactive as Etherscan in addressing the leaks, according to Szilagyi.  As he explained:  ""We get Etherscan to fix it, but can we get random dapp number 2,000 to fix it? Probably not. So users need to protect themselves, too.""  The same information – IP-to-ethereum address – is shared when users access other services as well, Szilágyi continued, like Infura, MetaMask, and MyCryptoWallet.  Discovery protocol  Szilagyi offered some other routes around this dilemma, including the use of the Tor network to hide IP addresses and the Brave browser to block online trackers.  But there are other, more subtle ways that access to ethereum can expose sensitive information as well, according to the developer. Taking the example of light clients – the stripped down, low-storage way for ethereum users to access the network – Szilagyi said that there are two kinds of activity on the network that are highly traceable.  The first is what is known as the ""discovery protocol.""  When light clients connect to the ethereum network, the IP is also revealed. Because light clients are continuously reconnecting over time, the discovery protocol reveals an accurate map of user location.  ""Every time I connect to the network I am actually revealing to the network that this machine which last week is in Berlin, this week was in Prague,"" Szilagyi said.  This location data is public, so in theory, anyone can scan the network to build a highly accurate, global map of ethereum user locations.  ""If you are willing to do this, for example, every day, just try to scan the network every day, then actually you can create an extremely accurate history of where each individual ethereum node was moving over time,"" Szilagyi said.  Additionally, key to how light clients work is the way in which the software minimizes activity by connecting to addresses that are associated with a user. But while this approach reduces bandwidth, latency and traffic, the impact is that IP and address relationships are rendered explicit on the network.  ""Light servers will be able to statistically map out that this particular IP address is interested in one particular address,"" Szilagyi said.  Similarly to the discovery protocol, this information can be easily accessible. And unfortunately, connecting over Tor will actually damage the reliability of the light client.  ""Now we don't a world map of moving IPs, now we have a world map of moving ethereum addresses,"" Szilagyi said, adding:  ""And again, similar to the ethereum discovery protocol, this can be done publicly by everyone.""  Best practice  Unfortunately, according Szilagyi, there's no simple fix for many of these problems, as some are inherent to how light clients and explorers function. But, speaking to the audience on Friday, the developer had precise recommendations to share with ethereum users and developers going forward.  Specifically, Szilagyi broke down three ways in which this information can be better concealed in the near-term.  First, he argued that users should run full nodes. While more hardware intensive, full nodes mean you can store all data locally and can access that data without interacting with anyone else. Additionally, because full nodes verify that ethereum's underlying state is correct, running a full node comes with security benefits as well.  ""Although people don't like full nodes, full nodes are actually the best anonymizers in the ethereum ecosystem,"" Szilagyi said.  Secondly, Szilagyi contended that developers should look to the work that has been done by anonymizing network layers, such as Tor browser and I2P, for research on how to better conceal metadata leaks at the network level.  ""Privacy on ethereum is bad, really, really bad. But that doesn't mean that it's an impossible task to solve,"" he said. ""There have been 20 years of research going into how to do this properly, so let's at least try to learn from their results and try to fix it.""  Lastly, Szilagy urged developers not to blame users for bad privacy practice when interacting with ethereum. He also noted that many users may be unaware that options like the Tor browser exist in the first place.  As such, Szilagy said: ""It's kind of up to us as dapp and platform developers to figure it out and fix it.""  With this in mind, Szilagy ended on a note of caution. Pointing to Facebook as an example, the developer said that when privacy-enforcing characteristics aren't embedded at the start, such an approach might carry repercussions in the future.  ""I don't think Facebook was created to gather user data, it wasn't created to abuse elections, that kind of just happened,"" Szilagy said, concluding:  ""We don't want to fix it to protect users from not only external attacks – I think it's really important to also highlight that we want to protect users from ourselves too.""

Shatner, a popular figure for his role in the Star Trek TV series, first tweeted a ""thumbs up"" to Buterin on Wednesday, which was quick to turn into a discussion thread.  In a reply to Shatner's tweet, one coder named ""premine apologist"" said about Buterin, ""He's a literal scammer"", adding that it is not possible to develop decentralized technology on ethereum.  To that, Shatner went on to defend the blockchain network, saying:  ""Then as a coder – go develop your own blockchain technology where you can be 1000% sure of decentralization. Or shove money in a mattress. I hear that's only overseen by the bed bug community.""  Later in the thread, the coder further described Buterin as ""dangerous."" Shatner responded:  ""His viewpoints don't take into account the fact that the code has to be audited by an auditing firm and approved by consortium or it doesn't get accepted. He thinks it exists in a bubble. That's why we have ERC-20, ERC-721... ERC-1701""  Some other comments on the thread appeared to be largely impressed by Shatner's understanding of the crypto world and that he was putting out his views out there.  One tweeted: ""OMG William Shatner is listing ERC standards in order to school a crypto troll.""  This is not the first time that Shatner has spoken of blockchain and cryptocurrency on Twitter. In a tweet about ethereum and Buterin earlier this week, he said:  ""@BobSummerwill the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance? Are we absolutely sure @VitalikButerin isn't a Star Wars fan?

In an interview, Larsen said that her time at the CFTC left her with a lasting impression, complimenting the agency for being ""sophisticated and nimble"" when it comes to investigating new products and markets.""It's a joy to work with the staff of the CFTC, in my opinion. I look forward to doing more as we look at these challenging aspects to these products [blockchain],"" she explained.  Larsen said her interest in emerging markets is what directed her towards blockchain and crypto-related law in the first place, telling CoinDesk:  ""I've always enjoyed working with markets as they're emerging and really facing the challenges for creative solutions and yet still having they comfort and security of being within a regulated market.""  Word of the new hire comes just weeks after the firm hired Dana Syracuse, a former NYDFS attorney who aided in the development of the state's cryptocurrency regulations, as well as the hire of former SEC Branch Chief Valerie Dahiya – both of who have joined the firm's blockchain industry group.

42402138,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3XOq,1541647539,Bitcoin Cash Declares War: Why Coming Hard Fork Could Mean Another Split,"""Do not come crying when you are bankrupt.""  Lobbed at those bitcoin cash enthusiasts supporting Bitcoin ABC, the main implementation of the blockchain software, Craig Wright seems to have no intention to compromise as the cryptocurrency gears up for its next system-wide upgrade, or hard fork.  The controversial figure who claims (without much evidence) that he is bitcoin's pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto has long been one of the leading figures of bitcoin cash, the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market cap, which famously broke off of bitcoin in the heat of the scaling debate last year.  But while he was initially embraced by the bitcoin cash community, he's now in the middle of a battle over its future.  While bitcoin cash has undergone several hard forks over its one-year lifespan, the forthcoming one – set for November 15 – doesn't have consensus from all the community.  The arguments started over which set of upgrades should be included in the code change. And less than a week from the activation date, the debate looks like it's going to split bitcoin cash into two different cryptocurrencies – one running Bitcoin ABC and the other running software created by Wright's company nChain called Bitcoin Satoshi's Vision (or Bitcoin SV). Though there aren't many data points so far, an experimental predictive trading market indicates that Bitcoin ABC has more user support.  And although Wright isn't quite endorsing an attack fully, on Twitter he seemed to provide a rationale for miners to use their power to ""kill off"" the blockchain running Bitcoin ABC. According to Wright, by deploying hashpower, Bitcoin SV miners can effectively mine empty blocks on the competing bitcoin cash blockchain, stopping transactions from going through.  Wright argues that these kinds of things are ""a part of the protocol"" and thus fine to do (and to his point, there are not rules preventing this).  And sure enough, one new mining project called SharkPool tweeted that it will ""exclusively"" mine empty blocks, pointing to Wright's tweetstorm as reasoning.  Still, Peter R. Rizun, the chief scientist for Bitcoin Unlimited, the second most popular software implementation of bitcoin cash, contends these threats are likely ""a bluff"" meant to scare Bitcoin ABC supporters.  Yet others, including Chris Pacia, a developer for ecommerce platform Open Bazaar and also on bitcoin cash, believe this to be the malicious attack of a man ""hell-bent on getting his way.""  Pacia told CoinDesk:  ""I don't mind splitting Craig Wright off, but he's threatened to destroy the other chain with a 51% [attack]. That's really uncool.""  Déjà vu?  If you've been in bitcoinland for long, this could all sound pretty familiar.  It was a little more than a year ago that bitcoin was seeped in debate about how to scale the network, and the community was battling over a seemingly very small feature of the online money: the size of its block size parameter.  Not everyone agreed on the way forward, so the debate into threats of a split. Bitcoin miners, much like Wright, even threatened to attack the other chain after the split.  Thus was forged bitcoin cash, a cryptocurrency which scrapped the upgrade Segregated Witness (SegWit) for a much larger block size parameter.  And while the bitcoin cash community largely agreed on the crypto's way forward for this first year, this harmonious face began to crack as the community grew. Soon enough, the community found itself immersed in its own block size debate.  The Bitcoin ABC software upgrade features a couple of key technical changes, including a so-called opcode to make it easier to execute ""atomic swaps,"" a technology for trustlessly trading one cryptocurrency for another. But it does not increase the block size any further – currently bitcoin cash has 32 MB block sizes.  But Wright's Bitcoin SV wants to see an increase in the block size parameter from 32 MB to 128 MB.  It's technical – and some would claim unnecessary at this point – but over the past several months, bitcoin cash supporters have begun choosing sides.  The largest bitcoin cash mining pool, CoinGeek, for instance, publicly announced that they were in support of Bitcoin SV (and bigger blocks) in August. On the flip side, information site and mining pool Bitcoin.com (run by perhaps bitcoin cash's most vocal supporters, including Roger Ver) recently announced support for Bitcoin ABC.  As a result of the ongoing controversy, many bitcoin cash-supporting businesses and exchanges – including Binance, Coinbase and Polintriza, as well as, instant payments application Money Button – have largely frozen operations for the time being.  Speaking to the nature of the upcoming hard fork or forks, CEO of Money Button Ryan X. Charles said that eventually ""users running implementations of the bitcoin cash software will have no choice but to upgrade to either one of the two competing.""  Political growing pains  So while the debate seems pretty technical, according to Bitcoin Unlimited's Rizun, the arguments boil down to a fight over power.  ""I don't want to participate in something to give more influence to nChain and Craig Wright,"" Rizun said, adding:  ""It's not a technical debate, it's about control.""  Meanwhile, Bitcoin SV supporters argue similarly about the other side.  ""Bitmain and Bitcoin.com working hard to ruin bitcoin,"" Calvin Ayre, the CEO of CoinGeek, tweeted.  He sees the changes BitcoinABC is hoping to make are dangerous, going as far as to argue in a blog post that one feature being put forth, DSV, which would give the cryptocurrency Augur-like mechanisms, could ""enable the network to be halted.""  Either way, though, Rizun argues that this level of heated debate shows that bitcoin cash will no longer be able to make the type of upgrades at the speed they used to.  ""I think what's happening is bitcoin cash has outgrown the need to have these regular hard forks,"" Rizun told CoinDesk. ""Because we set this plan in motion, we have this issue now for the first time where regulated hard forks are causing controversy.""  Yet, this controversy is affecting the businesses that moved over to bitcoin cash during its split from bitcoin in an effort to pioneer the cheaper, faster payment network they believed was the original intent of Satoshi Nakamoto.  Caught in the crossfire of the debate, Money Button's Charles is just waiting for the controversy to cool – hopefully with only one coin emerging.  ""The theory of money button is one money, not many. The product is worse in every way if we have to worry about managing different coins at the same time,"" Charles said, concluding:  ""I will happily embrace either side so long as there's a clear winner.""

42402130,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3XGy,1541644427,Crypto Exchange Poloniex Announces 'Pre-Fork' Trading for Bitcoin Cash,"Poloniex announced Tuesday it will be the first cryptocurrency exchange to offer trading for the pending bitcoin cash (BCH) hard fork amid an ongoing debate over the technology's roadmap.  Starting Wednesday night, Poloniex, operated by Goldman Sachs-backed startup Circle, revealed it will begin offering customers the option to buy bitcoin cash ABC (BCHABC) and bitcoin cash SV (BCHSV) trading tokens.  This is the first time Poloniex has offered trading pairs for a crypto asset prior to a possible fork, a move it says is part of a wider strategy to increase the company's customer experience, according to a company blog post.  The post reads:  ""We're doing this to empower customers to demonstrate their support for one coin over the other through trading activity. Poloniex will also support trading markets for both tokens after the hard fork.""  In the message, the exchange stressed its intention to remain neutral during the split in order to allow the community to decide which blockchain it will support, demonstrated through advanced trading activity. It also stated that it would be evaluating each hard fork individually to decide whether to support the fork or continue pre-fork trading.  Pre-fork trading has been made available for USDC/BCHSV and USDC/BCHABC as well as bitcoin trading pairs.  Customers will also be able to convert their BCH into an equivalent amount of BCHABC and BCHSV and vice versa if they wish to withdraw funds, but they will not be able to withdraw BCHABC and BCHSV ahead of the fork.  The exchange plans to continue supporting trading for both bitcoin cash ABC and SV after the planned fork on Nov. 15.  Overall, the news comes during what has been a slower trading day for the crypto asset, one that has surged of late on the news traders may be able to receive additional tokens through the creation of a competing blockchain, should the blockchain's users continue to support both versions of the technology.  At press time, the price of bitcoin cash is down 0.81 percent on the day.
