42427370,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKB4ph,1487607011,Rebranding The DAO: The Contentious Blockchain Concept is Back,"It looks like we haven't seen the last of leaderless blockchain-based companies.  Despite the spectacular demise of The DAO, developers are still excited about the concept of one day creating decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), automated companies operated by hard-coded rules enforced on a blockchain. As evidenced by discussions at the ethereum developer conference, EDCON 2017, nearly six months after the project lost millions, experimentation remains ongoing.  Since then, ethereum developers have been more cautious about unrolling autonomous organizations, but there's been rejuvenated interest in making an element that underpinned The DAO — smart contracts — better and more secure.  Still, in Paris this week, some are still skeptical of the idea of DAOs at all, since there's so much that the coded rules would have to be able to anticipate in advance.  Omise architect Rick Dudley told CoinDesk:  ""I try to avoid DAOs. Businesses rely on trade secrets and ultimately, fundamentally rely on humans to make business decisions and operate.""  New paint  But despite skepticism, the idea is far from dead.  It's a hard idea to eradicate, perhaps because developers see such promise in a system whereby businesses decisions are automated to a degree that power and bureaucracy can be limited. Even the developers behind The DAO announced in November that they plan to release a new DAO for charity projects.  The hope seems to be that they won't make the same mistake (or a new one) this time around.  Other upcoming DAO projects are a little bit more hesitant to announce that they are indeed enabling DAOs. Take for example Colony, a job market platform that recently entered beta.  While the founders wrote over a year ago that the platform would make DAOs ""as easy as a Facebook group,"" today, it doesn't mention DAOs on the homepage — although perhaps that's because in the near-term they offer more limited functionality, such as tokenizing tasks.  The case is similar for Aragon, a management platform for ""unstoppable companies."" (If you've been around you probably realize that they mean a DAO.)  Part of the reason that they simply call it a ""firm"" management platform is because they want it to appeal to more people.  ""We don't want to be very geeky, we don't want to focus only on ethereum developers who want to create DAOs. We want to just say, 'Hey people, you can create firms that are decentralized and reduce transaction costs,'"" said Aragon project lead Luis Cuende.  The platform allows people within the company to vote on decisions, such as whether to add stock, to divvy out company roles, and other company-wide tasks. Aragon will deploy the required smart contracts to create the firm under the hood.  ""It's a firm, but a peer-to-peer one. That's it,"" he said.  Ready or not?  Outside of a rebranding effort, however, there is a recognition that the concept itself might need iteration.  ""It needs some more work,"" Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University research fellow Primavera de Filippi told CoinDesk. ""The DAO showed that we cannot assume that the system will work as we expected it to work.”  Her talk at EDCON centered around a DAO she helped to create before The DAO, a ""plantoid"", or robot plant that accepts microtransactions. Now, she suggests that a wholly new type of management system is needed to address the issues developers have since discovered.  ""We cannot have this autonomous system that will just stay as it has been programmed, because we obviously cannot foresee all of the possibilities,"" she said.  Others are pressing ahead. Aragon wants to launch sooner, although it will take at least half a year before the project is ready.  Aragon tech lead Jorge Izquierdo noted, though, that they’re working with Zeppelin, which offers ethereum smart contracts templates that have seen wider testing. Beyond that, the group plans to subject their code to a security audit and to simulate some real use cases on the main ethereum network before unrolling it for wider use.  Cuende noted that, at least now, the risks are more well known:  ""We want to make sure people don't lose their money,""  EDCON image via Alyssa Hertig",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | RESEARCH,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2017/02/20/rebranding-the-dao-the-contentious-blockchain-concept-is-back,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4cd2c0276de951cc3d79b55abdf519fb03377fd8-1500x771.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42427367,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKB4nh,1487594205,3 Smart Contract Misconceptions,"Olivier Rikken is manager, public speaker and thought leader on digital disruption, blockchain and business process management at Axveco, a boutique consultancy firm headquartered in Amsterdam.  In this CoinDesk opinion article, Rikken outlines three common mistakes newcomers make when seeking to leverage blockchain-based smart contract technology.  One of the most promising developments in blockchain is the idea of smart contracts.  First detailed by cryptographer Nick Szabo in his 1994 paper ""Smart Contracts"", Szabo describes the concept as ""a computerized transaction protocol that executes the terms of a contract"". Today, the rise of the ethereum blockchain facilitates the easy development and deployment of this concept in a public environment.  Yet, this has led to a cloud of confusion around smart contracts. (For those less familiar with smart contracts, this article provides a nice introduction).  But before we dive in, I'd like to state that I believe the number of possibility and use cases for smart contracts are huge and can create real game changers across various industries. However, working with various companies on possibilities, I noticed that many are still struggling to understand what smart contracts really are, how they work and what they can do.  Here are the three issues that I encounter most:  1. ""Smart contracts are just code, not contracts""  A common phrase that is often quoted is ""smart contracts are neither smart nor contracts, they are just dumb code"".  In various cases, this might be true, like when you are creating a decentralized application that does not involve the transfer of value. However, in other cases, smart contracts can have more characteristics of conventional contracts.  When we look at conventional contracts, the semantics of a contract consist of two main elements namely:  Operational semantics, which is the operational interpretation of a contract. It describes the consideration of the precise actions as agreed and to be taken by the involved parties. This is typically what can be programmed into a smart contract.  Denotational semantics, the non-operational legal interpretation of the entire contract, including, but not limited to, any references to other documents, jurisdiction etc. This is the interpretation that would be given to the contract as a lawyer would read it. This element is in most cases not included in smart contract, although references could be added as comments in the code.  Why are people setting up contracts in the first place? Mostly because they don’t fully trust each other for the execution of an agreement (despite any verbal agreement) or as proof for third parties that a transfer of goods was legitimate.  Taking this and the operational element of contract semantics in mind, if a smart contract is the result of an agreement between two or more parties and ""signed"" by all parties (by actively transacting to the smart contract), it could thus be seen as constituting the operational semantics of a traditional contract, although written in an unfamiliar language.  Handling conflict could pretty much follow the same route as with all traditional contracts, ie via courts, mediation etc.  The main difference will be that in a lot of cases, the transfer of value as a result of automated contract execution has already has taken place.  2. ""Smart contracts can operate fully autonomously""  This brings us to the second misconception  One of the most common mistakes is that people have the perception that a smart contract can actively scan its environment and execute in response to changes accordingly, ie a smart contract proactively queries an external database and changes its own state based on the outcome of the query.  Blockchain, in its essence, is transaction driven. This is also the case for smart contracts and thus smart contracts are reactive.  The code of a smart contract is only executed when called upon by a transaction or message that is sent to the smart contract. This can either be done from an external account (owned by a natural person or a company) sending a transaction or another smart contract sending a message to the smart contract (this other smart contract being triggered by a transaction or message itself).  In addition, the information available to a smart contract during execution is quite limited.  As stated in the ethereum documentation, ""This execution needs to be completely deterministic, its only context is the position of the block on the blockchain and all data available"". Further, ""it is not only sandboxed but actually completely isolated, which means that code running inside the EVM has no access to network, filesystem or other processes. Smart contracts even have limited access to other smart contracts"".  The available data is the data sent to the contract in the transaction or message plus the data in the storage (state) and memory of the contract.  While a smart contract can call other smart contracts, (eg read balances of other smart contracts) re-entrancy is not recommended by various experts as they state it should only be used as a last resort.  Additionally, smart contracts can only do basic calculations like adding, subtracting and dividing. They are not capable of performing big data analytics.  So, when it comes to designing processes that involve smart contracts, know that, at this time, they are reactive, have limited information to work with, can only do basic calculations and have limited interaction possibilities. The examples as described here are primarily based on ethereum's smart contracts, which brings me to the last point.  ""THE smart contract""  There is no such thing as THE smart contract.  As people often make the mistake to talk about THE blockchain, instead of referring to a specific blockchain (eg bitcoin, ethereum, hyperledger, etc), the same mistake is often made for smart contracts.  Most blockchains have no smart contract capabilities at all, or if they do, it's only in very limited form or via pegged sidechain solutions.  The features that a smart contract can possess differ per blockchain.  So, when it comes to designing solutions that need smart contracts, there is no such thing as THE smart contract. In order to create a smart contract that meets your requirements, be very careful and precise when deciding which blockchain to use.

42427366,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKB4lh,1487588404,Where Bitcoin and Banking Collide,"Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis, corporate finance and fund management, and is a member of CoinDesk's product team.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered exclusively to our subscribers.  A relatively quiet and traditionally isolated market is about to set a precedent that could change the blockchain sector.  Last week  , CoinDesk met with a group of representatives from some of Japan’s blockchain startups and enterprise players. Conversation revolved around the upcoming regulation of cryptocurrencies, and the impact it would have on industry business models.  The consensus seemed to be that the new rules (a requirement to get a license from the Financial Services Agency, register with the anti-money laundering authorities and submit to periodic audits and inspections) would be good for the sector. Bestowing legitimacy will get both people and businesses more comfortable with alternative currencies, increasing volume, investment and network effects.  But that's not to say there isn't a cost.  One of the main risks is that the legislation ends up having the same effect as New York’s 'BitLicense', driving out businesses and stagnating the local ecosystem. And while you could argue that the additional stability and security is worth the loss of innovation and choice, the resulting consolidation is a step towards centralization in a sector based on decentralization.  On the other hand, a likely consequence is that large financial firms will take an interest in the cryptocurrency business, looking to diversify their offerings and broaden their client base.  Already, finance giant SBI has invested in exchanges BitFlyer and Kraken, and announced plans to set up its own. FX broker Money Partners Group invested in TechBureau. GMO Internet set up a cryptocurrency wallet. And, this week, three of Japan’s largest financial institutions participated in BitFlyer’s latest funding round.  The inflow of institutional funds will not only add liquidity and respectability to the sector. It will also give startups the impetus to both strengthen their business at home and grow internationally.  A new direction  While that impact will be significant, a potentially more far-reaching one will be the change in banking practices that could result.  We see frequent reports of bitcoin startups in other high-tech, allegedly innovative, financial centers having to shut down because banks won’t work with them.  Here, we have banks actually investing in or creating bitcoin businesses. The example set by Japanese banks could encourage a new tone in the global cryptocurrency sector.  We have become used to seeing banks dedicate resources and attention to blockchain projects. Although some have started experimenting on private versions of public blockchains, on the whole, banks have stayed away from bitcoin and its peers.  An increased interest in a different store of value, combined with a focus on improved processes, could lead to new innovations and use cases.  Don't dismiss Japan  To put this into perspective, we are looking at the potential symbiosis of two sectors that are both global leaders.  Tokyo is one of the top five financial centers worldwide. Furthermore, Japan recently overtook China as the largest bitcoin market.  Could this lead to a 'co-opting' of alternatives to fiat by the gatekeepers of the fiat system? Possibly, but the question misses the point.  An eventual mingling of the two was always inevitable, either as a stepping stone or as an end goal. If the example set by Japan spreads, we could be at the threshold of that phase.  This will imply a cultural shift on both sides.  However, the fundamentals of bitcoin are unlikely to change. The fundamentals of traditional banking could.

42427375,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKB4vh,1487584817,EU Lawmakers Propose to Ban Geo-Blocking of Digital Currency Users,"A European Parliament committee has proposed new measures that would prevent location-based discrimination against consumers in the economic bloc, including users of digital currencies.  The proposal, authored by the European Union Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, targets so-called 'geo-blocking', or prejudice against consumers on the internet based on their location. According to the lawmakers, geo-blocking is seen of the last obstacles to obtaining a cohesive European digital common market, known as the Digital Single Market.  The draft document states:  “The Commission should assess whether to provide the legal framework that allows, subject to the freedom of contract principle, the protection of undertakings and consumers when the transaction is carried through alternative modes of payment, including virtual currencies, other blockchain type transactions and ewallets.”  This is not the first time the EU has sought to regulate digital currency. In July 2016, regulators adopted a proposal strengthening oversight into anti-money laundering programs for virtual currency exchanges and wallet providers.  According to the European parliament draft, geo-blocking has become an issue caused in part by businesses refusing to deal with customers from jurisdictions with high levels of cyber crime.  Many argue that this unjustly affects innocent people located in those areas, who now have less access to EU goods and services than their peers.  Geoblocking is already prevalent in the US, where many bitcoin and digital currency-related businesses block customers living in New York for fear of violating 'BitLicense' legislation enacted by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).  Gambling sites, largely illegal in the United States, commonly block US-based IP addresses as well.
