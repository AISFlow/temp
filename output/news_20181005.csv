The 28-year-old musician, perhaps best-known for his debut single ""Crank That,"" debuted a new song about bitcoin in his latest album ""Young Draco."" Simply titled ""Bitcoin,"" the track describes how Soulja ""made [$1] million off of bitcoins"" after seemingly buying in at $6,000.  ""Man, this going crazy the cryptocurrency man,"" the lyrics begin, continuing:    ""I made 100 racks off of bitcoin (bit)      You can catch me trapping with the bitcoin (bit)    You can catch me running up the bitcoin (yeah)    I spent 6,000 on the bitcoin""    (Urban Dictionary defines ""100 racks"" as being $100,000.)  Soulja later indicates he may be paying bands using cryptocurrency, or at least his gains from his holdings (""I'm doing shows [?] feeling me ... running up the bands on cryptocurrency""), before referencing sending transactions through PayPal and the Cash App.  He also references owning litecoins, though he does not provide any firm details in the song about his holdings.  Soulja is the latest musician to reference cryptocurrencies, with Mims, Snoop Dogg, 3lau and Young Dirty Bastard all getting involved in the space through various projects or performances.  Most recently, bitcoin even played a cameo on Eminem's new album ""Kamikaze.""

42429754,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1Djh,1538769606,US Senators Seek Stronger Sanctions on Venezuela's 'Petro' Cryptocurrency,"A bipartisan group of U.S. senators is pushing for tighter sanctions against Venezuela's state-backed cryptocurrency, known as the petro.  The bill  , known as the Venezuela Humanitarian Relief, Reconstruction and Rule of Law Act of 2018, covers a range of areas related to Venezuela, including proposed humanitarian aid to migrants from the country and efforts to support ""restoring democracy"" amidst its long-running economic crisis.  The bill is sponsored by Senators Bob Mendendez, Marco Rubio, Bill Nelson, John Cornyn, Dick Durbin, David Perdue, Ben Cardin, Ted Cruz, Tim Kaine, Michael Bennet and Patrick Leahy, according to LegiScan. It was first introduced on September 24.  It notably includes a section mirroring an executive order signed by U.S President Donald Trump in March that imposed sanctions on the petro, which Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro unveiled last last year. The controversial cryptocurrency has drawn criticism and condemnation from some quarters while the government there itself has sought to implement it across a variety of industries. Earlier this week, Maduro said that a public sale of the petro would begin next month.  Yet the Senate bill takes Trump's executive order a step further, barring U.S. residents from providing ""software"" to the Venezuelan government as part of its efforts to launch the petro.  ""All transactions by a United States person or within the United States that relate to, provide financing for, provide software for, or otherwise deal in any digital currency, digital coin, or digital token, that was issued by, for, or on behalf of the Government of Venezuela are prohibited beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act,"" the bill states.  Call for sanctions report  The bill also includes a section calling for a ""report on the impact of cryptocurrencies on United States Sanctions,"" mandating the U.S. State Department – along with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Securities and Exchange Commission – ""submit a report to the appropriate congressional committees that provides an assessment on how digital currencies affect the effectiveness of United States sanctions around the world.""  The report, if the bill is passed and signed into law, would feature two main components. First, it would include details on efforts to use cryptocurrencies to evade U.S. sanctions.  Second, it calls for ""recommendations for new legislation and regulatory measures"" aimed at stopping such efforts, ""including through the direct or indirect use of products or services of United States based technology, software or financial services firms.""  The report would be due six months after the bill is signed into law.

The CFTC's Technology Advisory Committee (TAC) subcommittee on cryptocurrencies discussed securing digital assets during the hour-long session, highlighting issues with protecting investors' assets and how regulators may be able to assist in that area.  CFTC commissioner Brian Quintenz opened the meeting with a brief overview of the subcommittee, which was formed in February, explaining that the session ""should spur further discussion about how the CFTC, other regulators, spot platforms, and market participants can all contribute to enhancing this market's credibility and safety.""  As Andre McGregor of TLDR Capital pointed out, billions of dollars worth of bitcoin has been stolen over the last decade from crypto exchanges.  ""Consumers blindly trust hot wallets,"" he explained, and while some investors set up hardware wallets and take other actions to protect their holdings, many do not.  He referenced hacks from exchanges such as Mt. Gox, Bitfinex and even more recent ones such as last month's $60 million theft from Zaif.  Richard Gorelick, the head of market structure at trading firm DRW Holdings, told the meeting that ""smart regulation"" may be able to help the industry develop better practices to protect investors.  But this would only form one part of any wider potential solution, he said.  ""One of the points we raised on the subcommittee was that there is an opportunity for industry organized efforts to help fill some of these gaps,"" he said, adding:  ""They could be self-regulatory organizations or similar structures that help to define and enforce best practices and standards and accountability across the industry and there are efforts underway to start thinking about and building these types of organizations. There are lots of precedents in the traditional financial markets that we can look to for innovative governance structures that apply with markets that touch multiple jurisdictions.""  Two Sigma Investments managing director Alexander Stein added that improving exchange security would aid regulators and investors as well.  ""The Achilles heel [of bitcoin] is ... [the] unregulated world of exchanges where the exchange may or may this not be employing AML/KYC and if I can deposit bitcoin into some exchange outside of the United States, [that's game],"" he said.

42429764,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1E3h,1538752506,Chinese University Proposes Managing Web Domains On a Blockchain,"A major Chinese university is proposing blockchain technology as a better way to manage web domain names.  According to a patent application published Thursday by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the Shenzhen Graduate School at Peking University is examining how a ""consortium blockchain"" can improve security and efficiency in managing top-level domains (TLDs)  While the currently standard internet domain name system is already based on a distributed system, there are ""technical problems,"" the team contends.  For example, the current distribution of root name servers is unevenly around the world. As a result, the filing states:  ""Internet users in Asia enjoy a significantly slower domain name resolution speed than users in North America do, and when a root name server in Asia malfunctions, more than 20 million Internet users' requests for domain name resolution will be affected. It also results in a significantly lower reliability in Asian domain name resolution.""  As the blockchain ""invention"" shares data in a ""public and immutable way,"" it says, ""trusted agencies and even individuals can access information on blockchain and build a corresponding seed file database to store the mapping relations between the top-level and sub-domain name system.""  As a result, all regions can set up domain name servers according to their real-world needs ""in order to ensure the speed of internet access without being limited by other institutions.""  The proposed system also separates the domain name system into two layers, each corresponding to a sub-domain name system, it goes on. How the sub-domain system is designed is decided by the holder of the TLD. ""Therefore,"" the filing states, ""the sub-domain name system can be designed as either centralized system or decentralized system according to the institutions' wishes.""  An additional claimed advantage is that, being based on a system of distributed nodes, no ""consortium or small group"" can control the entire process. While cryptocurrencies are potentially prone to what's called a 51 percent attack (in which an entity that controls more than half of the network can rewrite transactions in their favor), only allowing ""trusted"" nodes means the proof-of-work mechanism by which miners secure a network ""is not required,"" the filing says.  The team further touts the system as ""completely compatible with the existing internet."" While a ""more concise and efficient consensus mechanism,"" brings security and reliability, and a layered structure ""ensures the efficiency and portability of the system.""

Bloomberg  reported Friday that Circle's acquisition will – if approved by regulators – open to the door to allowing startups to raise funds by selling digital tokens via its platform. The move would also expand the Circle team by 30 employees, according to the report.  CEO Jeremy Allaire told the publication:  ""This was a company who had been at the forefront of collaborating with government to figure out how to make it possible to innovate in the way people raise capital. Crypto securities are going to become a major new category of securities that ultimately every business is going to adopt, just like every business has a website.""  The acquisition comes months after Circle bought out Poloniex, a U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange. In February, the company laid out its plan to offer services around tokens representing a variety of assets, and Friday's announcement would seem to fit inside that bigger picture.  ""We envision a robust multi-sided distributed marketplace that can host tokens which represent everything of value: physical goods, fundraising and equity, real estate, creative productions such as works of art, music and literature, service leases and time-based rentals, credit, futures, and more,"" co-founders Jeremy Allaire and Sean Neville wrote at the time.  In a press release provided after this story was published, Circle said that the deal is subject to approval from the U.S.-based self-regulatory group FINRA.  ""A critical element of realizing this vision is building new ways for businesses, and ultimately individuals, to use crypto assets to more efficiently raise capital, manage investors and provide liquidity. Furthermore, Circle aims to continue to raise the bar for the crypto industry by embracing securities regulation as it applies to crypto and paving the way for security tokens,"" Allaire and Neville wrote.

The YouTube account propagating the file via a URL in the description has over 700 subscribers, according to the report, while the video had been viewed over 2,200 times.  Once clicked, the link takes the visitor/potential victim to a page asking them to subscribe to the YouTube account, after which they are allowed to download the fake tool.  Malwarebytes writes:  ""As far as the malicious file in question goes, at time of writing, 1,207 downloads had taken place. That's 1,207 downloads too many.""

Of concern to cryptocurrency users, it also looks for data linked to bitcoin wallets – with one image provided in the report that shows the malware specifically seeks out data related to the Electrum wallet.

42429768,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1Dvh,1538742651,VOIP Pioneer Says New Startup Is Paying Users Interest on Millions in Crypto,"Celsius, a cryptocurrency lending startup, says it's paying thousands of users interest for depositing bitcoin and ether with its wallet app.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Celsius claims to have garnered more than 10,000 users since the soft launch of its mobile app on June 29, with an average deposit of 0.5 bitcoin or 5.5 ether earning up to 6.7 percent on an annualized basis. The interest comes from income Celsius makes lending fiat and crypto, much of the latter to hedge funds that want to short, or bet against, the coins.  ""When we make interest income we pay a chunk of that back to the people who gave us BTC,"" said Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky, who's best known as a pioneer of Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP), the technology that allows phone calls via cyberspace.  Celsius raised $50 million in an initial coin offering last year, selling a token called CEL. Since then, it has gathered crypto deposits worth several million dollars, with hundreds of new users joining the platform each week in September, the company said.  Stepping back, interest-earning opportunities for crypto users are rare and may be particularly welcome in the current bear market as coin prices languish. As reported by CoinDesk, a rival company, Compound, launched last month, allowing people to invest crypto in a pool of short-term loans similar to a money market fund.  Yet crypto and lending often don't mix well. For instance, BTCJam and BitLendingClub, two peer-to-peer lending platforms, both wound down in 2016, citing regulatory issues. The individuals lending on these platforms had little recourse when the borrower defaulted, apart from online arbitration and, failing that, court.  Moreover, the ups and downs of crypto prices can only amplify the risk inherent in lending money.  ""To be able to consistently provide that return in assets that are so volatile is always going to be hard,"" said blockchain consultant Angus Champion de Crespigny.  Celsius, though, requires collateral for all its loans and it operates more like a bank than a P2P platform. The startup also boasts gravitas: In addition to telecom veteran Mashinsky, it counts academic cryptographer Scott Stornetta, who was cited multiple times in the original bitcoin white paper, as an advisor.  And beyond its current model, Celsius has a grand vision of putting its activities on its own blockchain.  Bank-like model  Unlike new rival Compound, which strictly lends crypto, most Celsius loans are issued in fiat, although the company requires crypto to be pledged as collateral for these.  Mashinsky told CoinDesk that Celsius' custodial crypto wallet, offered through a partnership with the qualified custodian BitGo, resembles a bank account in that users earn interest on their deposits every Monday.  Even as they do so, Celsius wallet users can withdraw their deposits at any time to a non-custodial wallet, or one where they control the private keys. In this way, the wallet resembles an interest-bearing checking account (though to be clear, there's no federal deposit insurance here).  Also like a bank, Celsius loans out part of the money deposited by crypto wallet users. The borrowers, typically hedge funds looking to sell the coin short, pledge dollars or other cryptos as collateral in these transactions, and pay interest in bitcoin.  In addition to these crypto wallet deposits, ""we have U.S. lenders who say 'show us you have capital and then we will lend you dollars cheaply,'"" Mashinksy said.  On the asset side of its balance sheet, Celsius has generated a dozen fiat loans totaling roughly $11 million, with repayment periods ranging from 30 days to three years. The startup is finalizing a $10 million loan in XRP.  The company also recently secured a deal to manage the United Nations Fifth Element crypto deposits from donors worldwide, assets the UN plans to deploy for various sustainability initiatives.  Yet Celsius could eventually face more formidable rivals, like actual banks. According to de Crespigny, there's no reason traditional financial institutions couldn't offer a competing deposit service for crypto assets. ""They [banks] are just evaluating the risk and rewards, the regulatory risks and the volatility of this product,"" he said.  Conversely, Celsius COO Daniel Leon argued that the startup could attract new users away from such institutions by consistently offering better returns to depositors and cheaper loans to borrowers without credit checks. He told CoinDesk:  ""We believe if we pay them [users] a little more, if we charge them a bit less, then we're going to win.""  One other thing Celsius has in common with banks: requiring know-your-customer identity checks.  Long-term vision  All things considered, Celsius hopes its biggest differentiator will be the auditable CEL blockchain, which it expects to launch by 2019.  ""We're building our own blockchain that is going to provide total transparency on all our banking activities like no other service out there,"" Leon said. ""That's our commitment to do this on a distributed ledger rather than a private server.""  Even before the CEL blockchain launches, Celsius accepts this ethereum-based token as repayment regardless of whether the loan was in a different currency, in order to establish the utility value of the token.  ""It's up to the user whether they repay in dollars or in CEL,"" Mashinsky said.  Once launched, the public CEL blockchain should allow users to audit every function performed across the platform, without revealing the identities of borrowers or depositors, the company says. Mashinsky said Celsius will use this blockchain to hold itself accountable for distributing all profits after operating costs to users.  That vision is what persuaded Satoshi-cited cryptographer Stornetta to join Celsius as an advisor. He's generally avoided involvement with crypto startups until now.  ""I made an exception, the first exception, for Celsius because I think their success is going to be a win for the entire blockchain community,"" Stornetta told CoinDesk.  Speaking to how Celsius offers services comparable to traditional banking, he concluded:  ""You have to take your idealism and couple it with the nuts and bolts of building a compelling, end-user value proposition.""

The news source also cites anonymous sources.  Has Yale University just plunged into the turbulent waters of the cryptocurrency space?  That's a big yes, according to an anonymous source cited in a Bloomberg report Friday. While yet to be officially confirmed, the Ivy League institution is said to have invested in a major crypto fund set up by Fred Ehrsam, Coinbase co-founder; Matt Huang, a former partner at Sequoia Capital; and Charles Noyes, who previously worked at Pantera Capital.  The report suggests that Yale, which boasts second-largest endowment among educational institutions globally (valued at $25.4 billion in 2016, says Wikipedia), was among investors that helped the Paradigm raise $400 million in the last several months.  As reported by The Wall Street Journal, Huang left Sequoia to join Ersham in setting up the new fund in June. Sequoia also invested in Paradigm according to that article.  Paradigm aims to invest in early-stage cryptocurrency, blockchain and exchange projects, Noyes told Bloomberg in June.  Today's report said that the scale of Yale's investment in the fund was unknown and that the university had not responded when contacted for comment.  The Yale endowment has grown to its huge current valuation from an initial fund of £562 donated by founder Elihu Yale in 1718. Harvard University has the most valuable endowment in the world currently, Wikipedia indicates.  With a reputation for seeking out for seeking out more unconventional investments, Yale's endowment has generated yearly returns of around 12.6 percent since the mid-'80s, the online knowledge source says.

42429780,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1EHh,1538736934,Little Known 'Choppiness Index' Could Warn of Bitcoin Price Breakout,"Timing an expected bitcoin price breakout after a prolonged period of consolidation is challenging, but a technical tool called the ""choppiness index"" may offer some insight.  The leading cryptocurrency has been displaying very choppy (moving in a restricted range) and inconsistent price action for a while now. Further, volatility readings have hit multi-month lows, indicating a big move up or down is overdue.  For instance, volatility, as indicated by Bollinger bandwidth, fell to its lowest in nearly two years on Sept. 26 and has remained low since. Yet, the big move still hasn't materialized.  Under such circumstances, most traders prefer to wait on the sidelines and enter the market after the range has been breached. So, having a tool which might indicate that BTC is in the early stages of a big move would boost traders' ability to time the impending breakout.  One such technical tool is the choppiness index, which oscillates between 0.00 and 100.00. Above 61.8 means the market lacks a clear directional bias and is likely to continue sideways trading. On the other hand, a reading below 38.2 indicates strong bullish or bearish bias.  Notably, the 61.8 level can be used to determine range breakout too, when the market is exhibiting choppiness.  Daily chart  The choppiness index is currently holding above 61.8, meaning the bitcoin market has remained stuck in range for a long period. However, traders should watch for a move below 61.8 – considered an early indication that an asset is preparing for a direction breakout.  As of writing, the index is located at 63.00.  View  Bullish breakout scenario: BTC's move above the stiff resistance of 50-day EMA of $6,640, if accompanied by a drop in the choppiness index below 61.8, could be an indication the cryptocurrency is aiming for a break above the upper Bollinger band of $6,806.  Bearish breakdown scenario: BTC's move below the immediate support of $6,424 (Oct. 3 low), if backed by a drop in the choppiness index below 61.8, would allow a break below the lower Bollinger band of $6,293.  It is worth noting that the choppiness index is not a directional indicator and only measures the market's trendiness (values below 38.20) versus the market's choppiness (values above 61.80).

White, whose most recently led the institution-focused section of the firm's operations, was said to departing by Coinbase on Thursday, a Reuters report indicates.  According to his LinkedIn profile, he has held the dual roles of vice president and general manager of Coinbase Institutional for two years, having joined in 2013 as vice president, business development & product management.  As reported by CoinDesk, the San Francisco-headquartered startup also revealed earlier this week that it has hired former Instinet CEO Jonathan Kellner as its new managing director of the Institutional Coverage Group.  Coinbase representative Elliott Suthers reportedly said in a statement that Kellner will be taking on some aspects of White's role at the firm.

The tests, which started on June 4, were held in conjunction with ABI Lab – a research lab supported by the Italian Banking Association (ABI) – and finished last week.  The project is aimed to improve certain aspects of ""spunta,"" or inter-bank transactions, such as the time needed to identify mismatched transactions between two banks, and the lack of a standardized process and a single communication protocol.  In the 10-month proof-of-concept and testing phase, each bank was assigned a node and the banks uploaded actual data bank data, processing 1,200,000 transactions through the course of the trial.  The interbank system is built on Corda Enterprise, the platform developed by blockchain consortium startup R3 that offers what's called a Blockchain Application Firewall. This enables the platform to be ""deployed inside corporate data centres, while retaining the ability to communicate securely with other nodes anywhere else in the world,"" according to a press release.  Katerina Koutoulaki, associate director at R3, told CoinDesk by email:  ""Currently, two banks involved in the project are members of R3. They share our goal of moving blockchain applications into commercial deployment and changing business from within and we are pleased to be working with them on this project""  The project also utilizes the Sia blockchain node infrastructure. The hope is to ""create bilateral channels through which each counterparty can exchange information whilst maintaining confidentiality and privacy so that only those with a need to see the data can access it,"" according to the release.

42429767,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1Dzh,1538712060,Crypto Prediction Market Augur Is Gearing Up for Its First Major Upgrade,"People want to use Augur, if only they could figure out how.  The decentralized platform for prediction markets based on real-world events launched on the ethereum blockchain in July. Since then, it has generated excitement beyond the usual crypto circles due to its perceived potential as a trustless, un-censorable platform to bet on sports, forecast elections, trade derivatives and hedge against risk.  But as a venture-capital investor said in a recent interview, Augur's ""biggest pain point is user experience."" This has meant that, following a brief honeymoon in which Augur attracted a flood of users (300 being a ""flood"" by decentralized application standards), the platform's daily active user count is now solidly below 100.  One would-be user even reached out to CoinDesk for guidance on how to get started on the platform, having gone to the project's website and found it was ""not user friendly at all.""  The developers behind the project, who are technically affiliated with the non-profit Forecast Foundation, recognize Augur's user experience problem.  As the foundation revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, the upcoming version two of Augur will include a number of improvements to the platform's inner-workings, which are meant to alleviate sources of clunkiness, confusion, extra cost and risk. ""The end goal,"" said the foundation's operations lead Tom Kysar, ""is always a better, faster, cheaper Augur.""  The post emphasized that the changes ""will be tentative up until all the code is written and audited."" Holders of Augur's REP token will need to migrate to a new smart contract if they want to upgrade. Joey Krug, Augur's co-founder, said that the two versions will be ""separate universes.""  In addition, the foundation is working on changes to the Augur app's user interface. While arguably more cosmetic, users have been clamoring for these changes since late July, just a couple of weeks after launch.  A ""wish list"" for version two on Reddit has gotten a lot of attention from the community, and Kysar said the foundation is basing its work on feedback from the thread.  V2 Blueprint  In a Medium post describing plans for version two, which the Forecast Foundation shared with CoinDesk, Augur's developers laid out a range of changes meant to improve the experience of creating and trading on Augur markets. A couple of these changes are focused on simplifying clunky processes.  For example, Augur currently supports two versions of each trading function which, the ""normal"" one, which Forecast Foundation lead developer Alex Chapman said ""doesn't really work,"" and one that allows the user to set the ""gas"" limit after which the function will stop trading. In v2 only the second version will be available.  Gas is a unit the ethereum network requires users to pay when accessing a smart contract. During periods of network congestion, these fees can see users pay several dollars per transaction.  Another change will overhaul the ""very inefficient and complex"" system for compensating ""reporters,"" the users who input information about an event's outcome, such as who won a game or an election.  In version two, Augur will pool reporter fees into a single contract and auction them off for REP, the platform's native crypto token. The REP the contract brings in will be destroyed. ""This effectively pays REP holders fees equally with [zero] gas cost to them and in a way that is far more favorable tax wise,"" according to the foundation's post.  Other planned changes are also focus on gas costs. Certain tweaks to smart contracts may be able to reduce gas costs by 25 percent or more, the foundation writes, though it doesn't specify what the tweaks will be.  Risk relief  A few of the planned version two changes are designed to reduce the risks involved in using Augur.  One example is the planned integration of the DAI stablecoin, meaning that users do not have to be exposed to major shifts in the value of ether (the ethereum network's main token) – particularly when their funds are locked up in a market for months or years.  Other changes are meant to make it more clear whether a market is valid. In theory, Augur markets can only refer to empirically verifiable, real-world events: whether it rained, whether a team won or lost, whether a coin hit a given price. In practice, people are creating markets like ""Does god exist?"" and ""This sentence is false.""  The question of whether or not a market will be declared invalid by REP holders – whose tokens allow them to vote to quash markets – may be having a chilling effect on users who wonder what markets it's safe to bet on. (Users can lose money betting on markets that are later marked invalid.)  To provide some clarity, the Forecast Foundation plans to allow explicit betting on the validity of a market. That way users will be able to see whether others consider a market subjective – or likely to be struck down for some other reason, for example because it incentivizes murder.  In the same vein, users will be able to add a message explaining their reasoning for certain actions, like disputing an outcome or reporting in a certain way.  Finally, v2 aims to speed things up. Currently, the ""designated reporter"" (an address specified by the market creator) has three days to weigh in before other users can snap up the reporting fee. The Forecast Foundation plans to reduce that to one day, as well as removing week-long waiting periods between dispute ""rounds.""  It also plans to disable a possible means of delaying market resolution, in which a user with sufficient tokens hold up the process without losing much money.  UI wish list  The changes above are likely to improve user experience, the Forecast Foundation argues, but they're not what users have been asking for. The community's ""wish list"" on Reddit shows a consistent focus on making the Augur app easier to navigate at the user interface (UI) level, rather than improving the efficiency of the Augur protocol.  For example, several users said they wanted to be able to search open markets more effectively – by keywords in the title, not just tags – and to sort them according to categories like volume and liquidity, as well as alphabetically.  A few of these have already been implemented, and Kysar told CoinDesk, ""The UI feedback from the wishlist threads is being worked on in parallel. The whole app and trading interface will have an overhaul at some point prior to v2 actually deploying.""  In the meantime, users can view, search and sort Augur markets using Predictions.Global, a third-party site that's not affiliated with the Forecast Foundation and offers many of the features the Augur community has requested for the app.  While Predictions.Global doesn't let users create markets or trade through the site, the site's co-founder Ryan Berckmans said, ""We'd love to serve as a centralized trading UI."" But, he added, ""that's at least six months away.""  Correction (13:39 UTC, Oct. 21, 2018): An earlier version of this article erroneously stated the that Augur v2 would be backwards compatible with v1. This has now been corrected.
