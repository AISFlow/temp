19379200,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=557528,1698274849,"Bitcoin Resumes Rally After Brief Hiatus, Here’s What Happened","Bitcoin saw a brief stall in its rally which triggered a decline back down to $33,700. This decline, seemingly out of nowhere, may have not been random given some developments in the crypto space. As the rally resumes once more, here’s a look at these developments. BlackRock Spot Bitcoin ETF Listing Taken Down The BlackRock Spot Bitcoin ETF was first listed on the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation’s (DTCC) on Tuesday, triggering the first wave of the Bitcoin rally. However, in the same day, crypto community members noticed that the listing on DTCC had been mysteriously taken down. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crosses $35,000, Here’s Why The listing would remain off the site for several hours while community members speculated on what could be the cause of this. Around this time, the price of Bitcoin began to fall, seemingly driven by the fact that investors saw the removal of the BlackRock listing as a sign that a Spot Bitcoin ETF wasn’t coming as soon as they expected. Hours later, Bloomberg Analyst Joe Light revealed that the listing was back up on the site. Apparently, the initial listing and the subsequent ones had carried one small change in detail which was a change in the Create/Redeem section from a “Y” to a “N.” Another Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart explained that this likely meant that it was to indicate whether the ETF listing was open to creations/redemptions. When Light asked if this change could point out a launch without using that attribute, to which Seyffart said: “I personally don’t think this means all that much if I’m being honest. Think it indicates Blackrock is getting everything ready to launch if and when they get an SEC approval. And that the N just means it’s not open for create redeem because it’s not live yet.” BTC recovers to $34,400 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com BTC Price Bounces Back The return of the BlackRock Spot Bitcoin ETF on the DTCC sparked enthusiasm across the space once more than it did before. The price of Bitcoin quickly started to recover and by Wednesday morning, was back above the $34,000 mark once more. Related Reading: ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood Reveals Why Bitcoin Will Reach $1.48 Million These events outline the importance of a Spot ETF and how it is the major driver behind the most recent price rally. So an approval or a rejection would both have a major impact on the digital asset’s price. For one, an approval would likely see Bitcoin clear above $40,000. However, a rejection would be detrimental to the rally, and will probably send it back below $30,000. Presently, Bitcoin is maintaining bullish momentum above $34,100. But it is seeing small losses of 0.99% on the 24-hour chart, and its daily trading volume is down 34.58%.

42392205,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg2tAv,1698274057,Lesser-known Johnson Wins Speaker Job as Crypto-focused Lawmakers Return to Old Roles,"After several failed attempts, Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives dug deep into their roster to elevate a less prominent and less controversial lawmaker, Rep. Mike Johnson (R-La.), as the new Speaker of the House.  The speaker, who drew three more than the 217 votes needed to win the job, doesn't have a track record in senior leadership or any history as a committee chairman. Indeed, he's only been a representative since 2017. But the well-liked lawmaker apparently didn't have the built-in slates of enemies burdening previous candidates, such as crypto-fan Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), who survived only four hours as the top candidate on Tuesday.  Johnson, who had led a subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, doesn't have a record on crypto issues. He was backed by mainstream Republicans as well as former President Donald Trump's favored ultra-conservative members after days of party despair over the inability to find a candidate who could win enough votes. Johnson is known most recently for voting against the temporary budget extension that kept the U.S. government open in September, and also for authoring a legal brief supporting the Texas bid to toss the 2020 presidential election result.  As Johnson takes the gavel, it frees up Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) to return to the House Financial Services Committee he leads, where he can focus more attention on the two crypto bills that haven't yet received floor votes. However, more urgent priorities are likely to include the funding of the federal government, which expires on Nov. 17. It's growing late in the year for Congress to tackle significant legislation beyond the must-pass funding measures.  Emmer, one of the crypto industry's most prominent allies on Capitol Hill, stays in his majority whip job – the third-ranking position in House leadership.

42392204,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg2svX,1698273119,Hobbled Crypto Exchange's Creditors Are Suing Its CEO and Want to Claw Back Money From 'Bitcoin Jesus',"In early 2023, CoinFLEX CEO Mark Lamb was in search of a life rope.  His Seychelles-based crypto exchange had just filed for restructuring, and a last-ditch attempt to save the company yielded help from an unlikely duo: Su Zhu and Kyle Davies, founders of the fallen crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (aka 3AC).  In January 2023, a pitch deck leaked for GTX, billed as a first-of-its-kind exchange for trading bankruptcy claims. The company was backed by Zhu, Davies, Lamb and CoinFLEX co-founder Sudhu Arumugam. It would be helmed by Leslie Lamb, the CoinFLEX CEO's wife.  The GTX deck immediately raised eyebrows. 3AC's Zhu and Davies were considered rare luminaries of the cryptocurrency space in the early days of decentralized finance and NFTs, but their reputations had been challenged by the time of their partnership with CoinFLEX, by which point 3AC had collapsed and helped trigger a broader crypto market downturn.  In a memo addressing the controversy around GTX and its team, CoinFLEX said the new venture would mark an ""evolution of CoinFLEX's commitment to building open and transparent financial markets"" and would ""increase value for CoinFLEX creditors.""  But now, creditors of CoinFLEX say that Mark Lamb was in breach of his fiduciary duties at CoinFLEX when he started the claims platform, which has since rebranded to ""OPNX."" In a Hong Kong civil court filing from CoinFLEX's creditors dated Oct. 12, OPNX is referred to as a ""competing business"" to CoinFLEX, and it's named as a co-defendant alongside Lamb and CoinFLEX investor Roger Ver.  The creditors frame the newer platform as a kind of cynical off-ramp for Lamb and his closest associates, and they say he should be barred from acting or speaking on CoinFLEX's behalf moving forward.  Mark Lamb did not respond to requests for comment sent by CoinDesk to his Telegram and X (formerly Twitter) accounts – though Telegram shows he read the message and he followed one of the authors of this piece on X after the direct message was sent. Leslie Lamb also did not respond to a request for comment sent via Telegram.  From GTX to OPNX  3AC was forced into liquidation in June 2022, when it became clear that Zhu and Davies had built the bulk of their empire on massive unsecured loans from a who's who of the biggest lenders in crypto. They spent the borrowed money on a series of failed crypto bets, and a $3 billion shortfall in 3AC creditor funds dealt a blow to the entire sector that it has yet to fully recover from.  When the GTX deck leaked, the idea of Zhu and Davies starting a new venture – one focused on crypto bankruptcies, at that – was viewed by some as deeply ironic, and maybe even a joke. A company name resembling the biggest crypto crash in history, ""FTX,"" didn't dispel that impression.  While CoinFLEX and so many other crypto platforms are now defunct, however, GTX isn't. Renamed OPNX, the platform launched publicly in April 2023 and has been live since then – albeit with minimal traction or fanfare.  The case against Lamb  OPNX was officially marketed as a direct rebrand of the CoinFLEX exchange. The CoinFLEX website was still online at press time, but a notice warned users to withdraw all of their funds from the platform by Oct. 31, 2023, at which point the firm would be ""officially ceasing operations and shutting down.""  The site also pitched users on its new platform: ""CoinFLEX is moving to OPNX (Open Exchange) in the coming months. We encourage you to migrate your account balances over.""  But the birth of OPNX was not authorized by CoinFLEX's board or creditors, the creditors allege in their October filing. They accuse Mark Lamb of going rogue and appropriating the company's intellectual property, technology, customer base and employees to build the claims exchange.  OPNX is incorporated in Seychelles yet maintains an office in Hong Kong. A copy of a writ of summons was served to the Hong Kong office on Oct. 12, a spokesperson for the creditors committee told CoinDesk. This document is used to initiate a civil proceeding, and CoinDesk obtained a copy of it from the spokesperson.  CoinFLEX's creditors say that Lamb, who was the CEO and co-founder of CoinFLEX, entered into a licensing and purchase agreement with OPNX's parent companies — Open Technologies Holding LTD and Open Technology Markets LTD — that was ""manifestly uncommercial and detrimental to [CoinFlex's] interests [...] and/or plainly for the benefit of"" Lamb and OPNX.  CoinFLEX's creditors are seeking to have these license and purchase agreements rendered null and void. They also want to have all assets and profits from OPNX placed into a trust for now.  OPNX struggles out of the gate  Crypto news site Protos reported earlier this month that OPNX has struggled to find its footing after opening. So far, the only bankruptcy claims that can be traded on the platform are from FTX. The price of OPNX's ""OX"" token has also dropped 83% from its August peak.  In August, OPNX was fined $2.7 million by Dubai’s crypto regulator for non-compliance, and the claims exchange is not listed as a licensed virtual assets exchange by Hong Kong's securities regulator.  Zhu was apprehended in Singapore last month in connection to his alleged non-compliance in 3AC's bankruptcy proceedings. Davies' location was not publicly known at press time, but 3AC's liquidators said in a statement last month that he was also wanted by Singaporean authorities for his alleged failure to cooperate with the bankruptcy.  'Bitcoin Jesus' makes an appearance  The OPNX writ of summons also accuses Lamb of acting without authorization when he entered CoinFLEX into a settlement agreement with Ver, a well-known crypto entrepreneur and early evangelist sometimes called ""Bitcoin Jesus.""  Ver was one of CoinFLEX's initial investors in 2019. His relationship with the exchange eventually turned sour, however, and in mid-2022 the pair made headlines when CoinFLEX entered into an arbitration process against Ver to recover what the exchange described as an $84 million debt he'd incurred on the platform.  Ver's margin trading account went deep into the red during the extreme market volatility that occurred after the Terra-Luna crypto crash in the first half of 2022 – the same crash that wiped out 3AC. CoinFLEX failed to liquidate Ver's mammoth position in time and was ultimately forced to file for restructuring – kicking off an ongoing feud between Ver and Lamb over who was to blame for the platform's collapse.  Publicly, Lamb offered Ver a deal where he could trade for free for two years on OPNX. Lamb also offered Peter Smith, co-founder of blockchain.com and a Ver associate, an equity stake in OPNX in exchange for acting as a market maker.  The new suit from CoinFLEX's creditors seeks to recoup any ""benefits and/or traceable proceeds"" Ver received as part of a settlement deal he ultimately made with Lamb.  But Ver told CoinDesk in an email on Monday that the public record of his dispute – and settlement – with CoinFLEX doesn't tell the full story.  According to Ver, who says he has not yet been served in connection to the Hong Kong summons, the truth of what he called his ""bogus arbitration"" with CoinFLEX was distorted by Lamb in public statements and press releases, as well as in communications with CoinFLEX's creditors.  Ver said he began an arbitration case against CoinFLEX in June 2022, seeking $200 million in damages he says he sustained as a result of trading on the platform. Ver alleged he had ""evidence that certain third parties were provided with knowledge of my sizable positions on CoinFLEX and traded against them to my detriment.""  ""I was the plaintiff, not CoinFLEX,"" Ver insisted, adding that the suit was kept confidential in accordance with Hong Kong law. CoinFLEX ""later filed a counterclaim for $84 million"" and, he claimed, Lamb ""broke confidentiality to intentionally misrepresent to the entire world that CoinFLEX was the plaintiff.""  Ver said that he eventually settled out of court with CoinFLEX and Lamb. As a part of his settlement deal, Ver said he would be entitled to the first $100 million from ""responsible third parties in further legal proceedings that are now being contemplated.""  In Ver's telling, his earnings from this purported settlement – which CoinFLEX's creditors seem intent on clawing back – should be his to keep. The story ""told by Mark Lamb was bogus,"" and ""I was, in fact, the largest victim of CoinFLEX,"" Ver insisted.

This extended bear trend has significantly impacted investor morale but one analyst sees a redemption in the future of the altcoin, in the form of a 220% surge to $1.5. MATIC Price To Make A 220% Break The analysis of the MATIC price came from crypto analyst FieryTrading. Taking to TradingView, the analyst paints a bullish future for MATIC which they believe could rise as high as $1.5. From this current level, this would be a 220% rally and likely make MATIC a top gainer. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bounce Above $35,000 Puts Holder Profitability At Yearly Highs FieryTrading pointed to the fact that the altcoin has been caught in a sell-off trend throughout the year. However, this sustained selling has been broken through after Bitcoin showed strength, and altcoins like MATIC followed. To the point, FieryTrading believes that MATIC has finally broken out of the bearish resistance that has held back the token all year. Chart shows recovery to $1.5 | Source: Tradingview.com However, not everyone agrees with the crypto analyst’s prediction for the Polygon native token. One user took to the comment section to share their own expectation, explaining that the MATIC price is going to fall further and $1 would not be reached. When FieryTrading inquired why the user believed MATIC would fall, they explained that they had insider information from working on a major project in the last year. According to the user, it’s not just MATIC but also Ethereum that could fall. “You are free to go long with polygon. Be careful,” the user cautioned. MATIC’s Struggles Continue Although the MATIC price has been able to follow the recovery trajectory of Bitcoin as well, it has not held on as well as others. After touching $0.661 on Tuesday, MATIC went into a sustained downtrend, and at a time when large altcoins are still seeing gains, MATIC is nursing 2.88% losses in the last day. Related Reading: Pro-XRP Legal Expert Shares Expectations If SEC Wins Appeal Against Ripple Additionally, the altcoin’s daily trading volume fell approximately 29% to $426 million on Thursday, which suggests traders and investors are going into a cooling-off period. So it is likely the MATIC price will continue to fall before it picks up steam again. However, if FieryTrading’s analysis is correct, then this downtrend would not last long. As for MATIC investors, the price recovery has done little to amend the low profitability. As IntoTheBlock data shows, only 11% of all MATIC holders are seeing profit. The vast majority of 87% are deep in losses, with only 2% holding bags at the same price at which they purchased them.

42392238,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg2tG3,1698269207,"Bitcoin Dominance Hits Fresh 30-Month High as Ether, Altcoins Lag in Rally","Bitcoin's crypto market share surged to 54.4%, the highest since April 2021.  BTC outperforms altcoins due to the spot ETF and safe haven narratives, one analyst noted.  Bitcoin's [BTC] market share of all cryptocurrencies rose to a fresh 30-month high Wednesday as BTC continues to beat most altcoins or alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins).  The BTC Dominance rate, which measures the largest crypto asset's market capitalization relative to the overall digital asset market, surged to 54.4%, the highest since the raging bull market of April 2021, according to TradingView data. Another way of phrasing it is that a ratio over 50% means bitcoin is worth more than all other cryptocurrencies combined.  The index spent almost two years oscillating between 39% and 49% before breaking out from the range in mid-June. The breakout coincided with BTC's rally above $30,000 on the news about BlackRock filing for a spot BTC ETF in the U.S.  The narrative still prevails in the investing landscape for digital assets, as observers take an eventual approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a near certainty, which could unleash a wave of fresh demand for the asset.  The rise of BTC dominance can be explained by the crypto market cycle and bitcoin's appeal as a less risky asset compared to altcoins, including the second-largest cryptocurrency ether [ETH], according to Noelle Acheson, market analyst and author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter.  ""Bitcoin tends to lead crypto markets in the early part of a cycle, only losing dominance when investors get more comfortable moving out on the risk curve and smaller tokens overtake in performance,"" Acheson noted Wednesday.  ""BTC has the ETF and safe haven narratives as tailwinds,"" she added. ""ETH has regulatory chill and upgrade uncertainty as headwinds.""  Bitcoin vs. Ethereum  BTC's price jumped 32% over the past month, CoinDesk data shows. Meanwhile, ETH advanced only 12%, and its relative value against BTC is at the brink of levels not seen since May 2021.  The performance gap is even starker when zooming out: Bitcoin’s price has doubled this year, while ETH is up about 50%.  Read more: Bitcoin Is Up 100% This Year. It's Not Just Because of Spot BTC ETF Hype  Bitcoin's bullish momentum could prove a harbinger of an altcoin rally.  ""Historically, when bitcoin’s price rises, that money begins filtering out into altcoins,"" John Glover, chief investment officer at crypto lender Ledn, said in an email.

Arthur Hayes Weighs In,"Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of BitMEX, a prominent cryptocurrency exchange, has recently shared his viewpoint, signaling a watershed moment for Bitcoin (BTC). With a world grappling with heightened geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainties, Hayes has delved into how these macro factors can impact the trajectory of Bitcoin. His recent blog post, “The Periphery,” casts light on the potential future Bitcoin is hinting at. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Surge Shakes Up ETF World: Who’s Soaring And Who’s Crashing? Wartime Economics And Bitcoin’s Rise Hayes underscores the geopolitical risks posed by the United States’ growing involvement in two new wars. According to the former CEO of BitMEX, the ripple effects of such escalations could have vast implications for the global economy. Tying this to the domestic financial scene, Hayes points out the notable halt in interest rate hikes by the United States Federal Reserve despite the looming inflation. Hayes identifies this as a possible “bear steepener” for the economy when long-term interest rates increase faster than short-term interest rates. Hayes further elucidates the intricate relationship between banks’ structural hedging needs and the borrowing necessities of the US war machine, which are both interlinked in the US Treasury market. The former CEO poses a thought-provoking argument: if long-term US Treasury bonds don’t offer the security investors traditionally expect, where will the money flow? Hayes further postulates that assets like gold, and more pivotally, Bitcoin, would surge, driven by genuine fears of “global wartime inflation.” Bitcoin Response To Geopolitical Instabilities Hayes observes that gold and Bitcoin are witnessing an upward momentum, contrasting with a pronounced selloff in “long-end US Treasuries.” The former CEO of BitMEX stresses that this movement isn’t a speculative response to potential spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) approvals. Instead, Bitcoin is a “barometer,” indicating an imminent “inflationary global wartime situation.” One of the culminating points Hayes touches upon in “The Periphery” is the possible eventuality where the Federal Reserve would no longer mask the true nature of the US Treasury market. According to Hayes, instead of portraying it as a free market, it would reveal its genuine form: a “Potemkin village” where the Federal Reserve sets interest levels based on political convenience. As revealed by Hayes, this epiphany would be a pivotal moment, propelling Bitcoin and the broader crypto market into a full-fledged bull phase. The former CEO of BitMEX further concludes: “This is the trigger,” suggesting a strategic pivot from short-term US Treasury bills towards cryptocurrency. Related Reading: From $35,000 To $500,000?

42392207,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg2t5n,1698265132,How Japan Is Leading the Race to Regulate Stablecoins,"Most major countries have yet to regulate stablecoins. One exception is Japan, a trailblazer in this area.  A stablecoin law took effect in the world’s third-largest economy in June. Japan’s example is important because it shows that stablecoin regulation is indeed possible. This would seem obvious, but it’s not. In the United States, for example, Congress is still fighting over this issue and no stablecoin bill has made it into law. The European Union’s stablecoin regulations take hold next year, but gray areas remain.  But Japan also shows that regulating stablecoins is not easy. Until recently this flavor of cryptocurrencies, which are designed to hold their value against a real-world asset like the U.S. dollar or the yen, were essentially banned in Japan. Now issuers are starting from scratch. On top of the regulatory hurdles, there is also a business challenge: How do you create a system that allows for stablecoins that are both secure and profitable to issue?  The stakes are high. Total stablecoin market cap is estimated to be over $124 billion. Big players are involved: PayPal recently issued its own stablecoin. There are various use cases. Investors in countries struggling with currency devaluation and high inflation use dollar stablecoins as a store of value. Other investors simply use them to trade for other cryptocurrencies.  At the same time, stablecoins’ prominence in the crypto industry has led to widespread concerns about their so-called stability. In May of 2022, the algorithmic stablecoin project Terra Luna collapsed, leading to losses of billions of dollars in value. There has long been widespread concern about the world’s dominant stablecoin, Tether, which the New York Times called “The Coin that Could Wreck Crypto.” The fear is a run on the bank scenario in which investors en masse try to redeem their stablecoins for dollars, for example, only to find that there are not enough dollars to make them whole.  Japan’s stablecoin regulations attempt to address some of the biggest fears about major stablecoins: Do issuers really have the assets to back them? And even if they do, how do you ensure that assets are easily accessible and not tied up in opaque and risky investments?  Now, we wait  These are not easy problems to solve, which means that launching a stablecoin in Japan will not be quick. In fact, Japan’s first stablecoins will likely launch next June at the earliest, said Tatsuya Saito, founder and CEO at Progmat, a software platform for issuing and managing digital assets. It can take at least a year to complete the requirements for the license and have it approved by Japanese regulators, Saito said.  In September, Binance Japan (the local arm of the world’s largest crypto exchange), Mitsubishi Trust Bank and Progmat announced a partnership exploring the creation of a new stablecoin.  Saito told CoinDesk that he is in conversation with ten different projects that want to launch stablecoins in Japan. All ten want to issue both a dollar-based and a yen-based stablecoin. Several of the projects he is consulting with are overseas companies, he said. None of these projects have officially begun the licensing process, according to Saito. They are just in the exploration stage.  Circle, issuer of USDC, the world’s second-largest stablecoin by market cap, has publicly said that it is looking at the Japanese market.  Only banks, trust companies and fund transfer services may issue stablecoins in Japan. Stablecoin issuers might establish a trust inside Japan, and issue the stablecoin through that vehicle. The assets backing the stablecoins trading on Japanese exchanges would need to be held in this trust.  For foreign stablecoin issuers, this would seem to be an unusually strict requirement. But according to Saito, there is a more practical way to stay in line with regulations.  By partnering with Japanese trust banks, issuers can issue their own branded stablecoins without having to obtain a special license in Japan.  Issuers can outsource to the trust the domestic custody and administration of the underlying asset in accordance with regulations.  Cryptocurrency exchanges that want to list stablecoins will have to apply for licenses as well, Saito said, but none have officially started the process. ""They are still preparing.”  Business challenge  Japan’s regulation has some strict provisions to protect the assets underlying stablecoins. If a domestic stablecoin is issued under a trust structure, which is expected to be a common way to issue stablecoins, “100% of the legal currencies (e.g, dollars or yen) backing a stablecoin must be kept in a trust inside Japan, and can only be invested in bank deposits inside Japan,” says Keisuke Hatano, partner at the law firm of Anderson Mori & Tomotsune.  But while this requirement might help ensure the security of assets, it can make it harder for stablecoin issuers to make money. “This poses a challenge for domestic yen-based stablecoins, as the interest rate for Japanese bank deposits is currently very low (in most cases below 0.1%).”  It’s slightly better for dollar-based domestic stablecoins, Hatano notes. “You still have to keep all the dollars in bank deposits in a bank in Japan, but you can get a higher interest rate for dollar deposits.”  Others in the Japanese stablecoin scene also said issuers face a real business challenge.  “Will stablecoins succeed in Japan? It's hard to say,” said Fumiaki Sano, partner at the law firm of Kataoka and Kobayashi LPC. “You can't invest the underlying assets, and if the transaction fees are too high, no one will use them. So what is the business model? Compliance costs are high as well, which means you have to find a way to monetize them.”  Sano cites other ways new regulations could introduce business challenges. “For exchanges that handle foreign stablecoins, there is a one million yen limit per transaction with those stablecoins,” he explains.  “If a foreign stablecoin issuer wanted to build its own entity in Japan through a trust, for example, it wouldn't have that limit. But then the stablecoin issued in Japan would be different from the stablecoin circulating globally. For example, it would be like if Circle issued USDCJ instead of USDC -- there wouldn't be the same liquidity.""  Striking the right balance between security and profitability is just one reason why it takes time to get stablecoin regulations in place, and help explain why various other jurisdictions have yet to see stablecoin regulations become law. Japan is worth watching as it navigates these challenges in real time.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Emily Parker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/25/how-japan-is-leading-the-race-to-regulate-stablecoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0fc98317629a3b01f4859d13cec7529e6c84491e-1980x1113.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

19373231,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=557525,1698264038,Are Bitcoin Derivatives Behind The Latest Rally? Glassnode Answers,"Since the latest Bitcoin rally started, there has been speculation going on as to whether derivatives fuel the surge. Here’s what Glassnode says. Bitcoin Funding Rates Have Remained Cool Recently In its latest weekly report, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about what the derivatives side of the market has looked like while the latest rally in the asset has occurred. First, the report has looked into the open interest of the perpetual swap markets, where “open interest” refers to the total amount of Bitcoin contracts currently open. The metric has been measured in terms of BTC here so that the USD price fluctuations don’t affect the trend. Looks like the value of the metric has plunged in recent days | Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 43, 2023 From the chart, it’s visible that the Bitcoin open interest saw two large liquidation squeezes back in January and August, with the former one being a short squeeze and the latter one being a long squeeze. Related Reading: Will Ethereum Rally Continue? These Could Be The Factors To Watch Since the latest rally started, BTC has observed two liquidation events: one of 25,000 BTC and the other of 33,000 BTC. This combined short squeeze is now of the same scale as the aforementioned mass liquidation events. In terms of the USD values of the liquidation events, the latest squeeze is again comparable with the other ones this year: A large amount of short liquidations seem to have occurred recently | Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 43, 2023 On the topic of liquidations, Glassnode reveals that, interestingly, the market has been dominated by long liquidations throughout the history of Bitcoin. There have only been a few phases where shorts have dominated the longs over 30 days. The latest large short liquidations have resulted in the shorts just overtaking the longs, as the chart below shows. Short liquidations have surpassed long liquidations | Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 43, 2023 Curiously, it would appear that during the few periods that the short liquidations have dominated the market (highlighted in yellow), Bitcoin has observed a point of extreme in its price. While the liquidation data would suggest that the derivatives have indeed played a role in driving the market through this latest rally, the funding rates could tell a different story. The funding rates have been positive recently | Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 43, 2023 “Of note is that funding rates and cash-and-carry basis in futures markets have remained relatively calm all things considered,” explains Glassnode. “2023 has generally seen futures markets yield annualized rates over 6%, which are greater than US treasury rates.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Stay Resolute Despite Rally, Supply Hits New ATH Back in August, however, the selloff cooled off these funding rates, and they have since remained relatively low. Even with the latest chaos in the market, the metric still hasn’t seen any significant uptick. The analytics firm notes that this could imply the Bitcoin rally is only partially driven by leveraged speculation. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $34,300, up 23% in the past week.

19371278,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=557492,1698260420,"Massive Ethereum Whale Transfer Threatens To End ETH Rally, Here’s Why","In a recent development, Ethereum’s latest resurgence (up over 12% in the last seven days) could be threatened by the actions of an Ethereum whale who could potentially end the token’s rally and further cause it to decline. Ethereum Whale Moves 30,710 ETH In a post shared on the X (formerly Twitter) platform, a crypto-related account with the username ‘EmberCN’ noted that a particular Ethereum whale who had withdrawn a total of 42,311 ETH from the crypto exchange Binance since September 20 had just transferred 30,710 ETH (out of the withdrawn funds) back to Binance. Related Reading: Pro-XRP Legal Expert Shares Expectations If SEC Wins Appeal Against Ripple The account further mentioned that the average ETH price at which this whale had accumulated these tokens is about $1,667, which instantly shows that the whale is currently in profit and could be looking to realize some of their gains by selling the transferred tokens on Binance. However, the crypto community will be more concerned with how a potential sell-off could negatively impact the market. It would add to the selling pressure on the asset, which could cause a decline, especially if there is no buying pressure to match it. Some might be more inclined to believe that this amount of ETH may not matter in the grand scheme of things, considering that it was recently reported that Ethereum’s ‘Billionaires’ control one-third of the token’s circulating supply. This category of persons is those who hold 1 million ETH and above. It is also worth mentioning that on-chain data shows that the Ethereum whale has, since the transfer of the 30,710 ETH, gone on to transfer the tokens to another Binance wallet, which has spread the ETH across different wallets. Another Busy ETH Whale In a post shared on its X platform, the analytics platform Scopescan revealed that the 1inch investment fund had sold 4,685 stETH (staked Ethereum on the Lido platform) for $8.54 million at an average price of $1,823. In the process, they realized an estimated profit of $1.28 million as these stETH were said to be bought on October 13 at the average price of $1,550. Related Reading: Bitcoin Spot ETF Approval: Why Price Could Be Set For 300% Surge The move may not come as a surprise to some as the investment fund, which has close ties to the DEX aggregator 1Inch, has been actively trading Ethereum since the beginning of the year. During that period, it bought a cumulative total of 17,000 ETH and then went on to take some profits by liquidating 11,000 ETH at $1,906 for $21 million, making a profit of about $3.7 million in the process.

42392202,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg2slH,1698259025,Sam Bankman-Fried’s Desperate Last Stand,"As the trial of Sam Bankman-Fried has unfolded the last couple of weeks, one question has lingered heavily in the air. Would he testify?  We now know the answer.  Today, SBF’s defense team revealed that the fallen crypto king would indeed be taking the stand. It could happen as early as Thursday, as the prosecution side hands over to the defense to make its case.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  SBF has faced a barrage of incriminating testimony at the federal courthouse in Lower Manhattan. Once close and intimate colleagues, including Caroline Ellison, Nishad Singh and Gary Wang, all now working with the government, have lined up to say SBF knowingly defrauded investors, lenders and customers to the tune of billions of dollars. Legal observers agree that the case has been going extremely badly for SBF and that the defense has generally failed to hit its stride thus far.  “I haven't seen a genius level of defense that you would expect to see with somebody who has money,” Joseph Tully, a prominent criminal defense attorney, told a CoinDesk Twitter Spaces event about the trial last week. “I think what this case needs is a street fighter and I don't think SBF is getting that. And that's disappointing to me.""  Such was the defense’s poor showing in questioning witnesses that the judge even seemed to be mocking SBF’s lawyers at times. “There were some moments where the judge seemed to almost be making fun of the defense lawyer,"" Josh Klayman, a digital assets lawyer with Linklaters, told the same Spaces panel. ""There were moments of levity and yet they were levity at the expense, in my view, of the defense counsel.""  Klayman and Tully both thought SBF would take the stand this week – for two reasons.  One, SBF has long had confidence in his persuasive capabilities. Following FTX’s collapse last November, SBF back-channeled with numerous reporters to tell his side of story, often downplaying his knowledge of what was happening and – in a preview of his current defense – making out that he was more out-of-his-depth than malevolent and calculating. He even started his own Substack, going against the advice of numerous lawyers who cautioned against self-incrimination. And two: He has nothing to lose at this point. SBF is very likely to be convicted on at least some of the multiple counts of fraud he faces, and he’s very likely to go to prison. His best chance of a reduced sentence, the thinking goes, is to make a case that he never intended to defraud.  That’s key, because the prosecution needs to prove not only that investors and customers were defrauded, but that SBF knowingly and deliberately did so.  Read more: Sam Bankman-Fried to Testify at His Criminal Trial as Soon as Thursday  But testifying in your own defense is highly risky, Tully said. SBF may be forced to say things he doesn’t want to say and to be pressed on questions and details he hadn’t expected to be pressed on. Moreover, in SBF’s case, he has to tread a fine line between coming across as a “credible witness” and playing the “out-of-his-depth” neophyte that his defense strategy rests on.  ""It's a double-edged sword. The more they put him on the stand and the more articulate and organized he is, it cuts against their defense that he's a math nerd and basically the 'SBF is an idiot’ defense,"" Tully told CoinDesk last week.  As theater, the spectacle of SBF testifying will be unmissable. We’ll finally see the man himself, unfiltered and unmediated by his enablers. We’ll see a human being who once had so much reduced to explaining the fine detail of his failings. We’ll see a man who was a hero of entrepreneurial daring laid bare.  In many ways, it seems only fitting. SBF rose on the back of his own myth-making abilities. Now his fate rests on his capacity to tell a story, and play a role, that might help reduce his jail time. But it will be tough to watch as well. SBF will occupy a place nobody ever wants to be, and he will be alone, without the filter of others to hold his hand and make him look good.  It’s a desperate gamble and yet, apparently, the only real play SBF has left. If he wants to reshape the narrative of the case, he has no choice but to go bat for himself and hope for the best.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | REGULATION,Benjamin Schiller,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/10/25/sam-bankman-frieds-desperate-last-stand,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f6a2741138911a274c69886a74773c7caed9df5b-874x492.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

He said he would “let that play out” and not pre-judge the situation before SEC staff makes recommendations to the five-member commission.  When asked to give any indications on timing or the order applications might be considered, Gensler demurred.  Grayscale and the rest of the industry now await the outcome of a court order that vacated the SEC's rejection of the company's effort to convert GBTC to an ETF. Major financial firms such as Fidelity and BlackRock are in the same boat, eager to find out how the regulator will approach pending applications for spot ETFs. Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, which is the parent company of CoinDesk.  Gensler also declined on Wednesday to comment on other court cases his agency is pursuing against crypto firms.  ""I'm going to let each of these crypto exchange cases speak for themselves, and they're in front of jurists,"" he said. ""They'll play themselves out where they play themselves out.""  The chairman came to the event to make a speech about SEC enforcement, and those remarks were heavily threaded with criticisms of the crypto industry that he said -- in a frequently repeated phrase -- is ""rife with non-compliance."" When it came time to take questions, the moderator began with that topic, to which Gensler addressed how much crypto has become a consuming subject despite its relative scale.  ""We have a $110 trillion capital market,"" he said. ""Crypto worldwide might be a trillion, but in the U.S. is less. So just by that, it's well less than one percent of U.S. capital markets.""  In the hallway outside the event ballroom, Gensler chatted with Zeke Faux, the author of the recent book about the FTX collapse, ""Number Go Up.""

19369348,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=557470,1698256835,Will Ethereum Rally Continue? These Could Be The Factors To Watch,"The data of two on-chain indicators may be referred to for finding out whether the latest Ethereum rally can go on or not. Ethereum Has Enjoyed A Sharp Rally Of More Than 12% In The Past Week Like the rest of the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum has observed a rally during the past few days. Although the coin’s bullish momentum hasn’t been quite as strong as Bitcoin’s, its weekly gains of 12% are still nonetheless significant. Yesterday, the asset had been carrying even higher profits, as its price had touched above $1,850. In the past day, though, ETH has noted some drawdown, as it’s now trading under the $1,800 level. ETH has registered some sharp growth in recent days | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView After the pullback, some investors have been wondering whether the Ethereum rally is done for now or if it has hopes for continuing further. On-chain data from Santiment may hold some hints about that. ETH Exchange Supply Has Plunged, While Whale Transfers Have Spiked In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has discussed two important ETH metrics. The first of these is the “whale transaction count,” which keeps track of the total number of Ethereum transactions that carry a value of at least $100,000. Related Reading: All Clear For $40,000? Bitcoin Shows Little On-Chain Resistance Ahead Generally, only the whale entities are capable of moving such a large amount of the asset with a single transfer, so transactions of this scale are assumed to reflect the behavior of these humongous investors. The below chart shows the trend in this ETH indicator over the past few months. Looks like the value of the metric has been quite high in recent days | Source: Santiment on X As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum whale transaction count has observed some pretty high values recently. This suggests that these large holders have been quite active in the market. At the peak of this spike, the indicator had a value of 6,049, which is the highest number of daily transactions that the whales have made on the network since April of this year. The whale transaction count metric by itself can’t point towards a bullish or bearish outcome for the cryptocurrency, as both selling and buying transfers are included in the count. It’s true, however, that whales would need to stay active if the rally has to continue, as their contribution will provide the necessary fuel for it. So far, the whales have been active indeed, but it remains to be seen whether they are still buying or if they are pivoting towards selling. The pullback in the Ethereum price may hint towards the latter. The other indicator that Santiment has attached to the chart is the “supply on exchanges,” which measures the percentage of the total circulating ETH supply that’s sitting in the wallets of all centralized exchanges. From the graph, it’s visible that this indicator has only continued to slide down since the rally started, implying that investors have continued to make net withdrawals from these platforms. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Stay Resolute Despite Rally, Supply Hits New ATH At present, 8.41% of the ETH supply is on exchanges, which is the lowest level since July 2015. Holders continuing to withdraw their coins can be a constructive sign for the cryptocurrency, as it can be a sign that accumulation is going on.

The $35,000 area represents a monthly resistance level for the price, and could mean that bitcoin will consolidate below for some time following the crypto’s big run higher, said Charles Edwards, founder of Bitcoin-focused hedge fund Capriole Investments.  ""Bitcoin miners are selling off more of their treasury than usual today; this can be a warning sign for consolidation,"" said Edwards. He noted an uptick in Capriole's Bitcoin Miner Sell Pressure, which indicates that BTC miners are selling a bigger part of their revenues than on average.

""While price may temporarily stall here at monthly resistance, the next significant trouble area is low- to mid-$40Ks,"" he said. ""We expect bitcoin will take us there in short order given the data on hand.""

42392212,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg2tfh,1698253884,"All of a Sudden, It’s All About Bitcoin","Everybody’s talking about the surge in the bitcoin (BTC) price as anticipation heats up over new spot ETFs. But there’s a lot of activity happening in Bitcoin tech development – with innovations that might help the original and oldest blockchain to catch up with the boom of projects building in the Ethereum ecosystem. In this week’s Network News, we dive into the significance of Lightning Labs’ release of “Taproot Assets.”  For our feature this week, our Margaux Nijkerk brings a colorful profile of an Ethereum Foundation security researcher who spends his time (sometimes working out of an Airstream parked in the mountains) scouring the Ethereum blockchain for any vulnerabilities – including a technique known as “fuzzing.”  You're reading The Protocol, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that explores the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Subscribe here to get it every week.  Network news  Schematic of a “replacement cycling attack” on Bitcoin’s Lightning Network. (Mononaut)  BITCOIN BLOSSOMS: It’s not just bitcoin’s price that’s suddenly exploding – thanks to speculation that U.S. regulators might approve new exchange-traded funds or ETFs allowing traditional investors to ape in. There’s also an upsurge in new products and technologies claiming to enhance the oldest and largest blockchain. Just two weeks ago, The Protocol covered the details of Robin Linus’s research paper on “BitVM,” proposing a way of incorporating smart contracts onto Bitcoin. The development offered yet another manifestation of Bitcoin getting Ethereum-style features that many members of the community had previously resisted – recalling the explosion earlier this year of “Bitcoin NFTs” via the Ordinals protocol. Now there’s another: Taproot Assets, a project from the developer Lightning Labs that would enable the issuance of stablecoins and other digital assets on Bitcoin and the layer-2 Lightning Network. “This release marks the dawn of a new era for Bitcoin,” Ryan Gentry, director of development at Lightning Labs, wrote in a blog post last week, while quickly adding that the project “upholds Bitcoin’s core values.” On the question of whether Taproot Assets might cause congestion on Bitcoin similar to what happened after Ordinals debuted, Gentry told CoinDesk it isn’t likely. ​​""The protocol only requires an issuer to make a single bitcoin transaction to mint an effectively unbounded amount of Taproot Assets, and all of the metadata describing those assets is stored off-chain, with only a cryptographic commitment to the assets stored on-chain,"" Gentry wrote in a direct message. ""Further, transacting with Taproot Assets over the Lightning Network will happen off-chain and will not touch the blockchain at all."" The crypto analysis firm Messari summed it all up in a report on Wednesday: “Developers have embraced the network’s inherent constraints and learned to innovate on top of the base layer.”  RISK MITIGATION: Bitcoin developer Antoine Riard’s warning over “replacement cycling attacks” on the Lightning Network has drawn buzz and yuks on social media, as experts rushed to explain the extent of the risk and offered suggestions for a fix. The gist of it is that these attacks rely on a deep understanding of the arcana of “hashed time locked contracts,” or HTLCs, which are a type of conditional payment used in Lightning Network payment channels. According to the Bitcoin Optech newsletter on Wednesday: “Since the disclosure, implementations have been updated to include mitigations for the attack and we strongly recommend upgrading to the latest version of your preferred LN software.” Those include more frequent rebroadcasting of transactions, though such steps aren’t likely to bridge the gap. Bitcoin Optech noted that, since Riard’s disclosure of the vulnerability, more than 40 separate posts have been made to developer mailing lists offering “proposed additional mitigations.”  ALSO:  The Aptos blockchain suffered its first major transaction delay, lasting five-plus hours and attributed to “a non-determinism” introduced by a code change in August that only became apparent last week.  In the wake of Lido Finance’s decision to discontinue new requests for staking Solana’s SOL token, there’s a new community proposal to also sunset on Polygon, claiming some $3.4 million has been invested in the initiative to get only $166,683 a year in fees: “This ROI is a sheer waste,” the author wrote.

The company's recent strategies, including the sale of a mining facility in Texas and plans to acquire 27,000 high-efficiency miners from Bitmain, suggest a potential comeback. While there have been operational improvements, the company's profitability still depends on the performance of Bitcoin and there are risks associated with investing in this stock. Thesis Last year's long crypto bear market affected most Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining companies, and Core Scientific (CORZQ) was forced to enter a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding. Core Scientific now stands at a pivotal juncture in its restructuring. The company's recent strategies like the divestiture of a mining facility in Texas, and a deal to acquire 27,000 Bitmain high-efficiency miners seem to be setting the stage for a comeback. As the crypto market gains fresh momentum, driven by the growing speculation regarding a potential spot Bitcoin ETF approval by the SEC, Core Scientific's revamped mining infrastructure positions the company to capitalize on this growing momentum. However, there are still concerns about net loss and Bitcoin's speculative nature, making CORZQ a risky stock. A Long Walk To Restructuring This article delves into the analysis and comparison of Core Scientific's financial health pre- and post-bankruptcy. Core Scientific's restructuring journey has been a fight to get back liquidity and clear off debt. At the time of filing for bankruptcy (December 2022), Core Scientific's debt problem was so serious that many expected the company to be completely out of business in no time. The latest quarterly filing at the time (Q3 2022) showed that the company reported $434 million in net losses. Total current assets were $213 million, while total current liabilities were $1.3 billion. Core Scientific had a serious liquidity problem. The working capital ratio at that time would be a meager 0.16, and the price of Bitcoin was at a 65% decline YTD, trading at ~$16,700 at that time. It is easy to deduce that the decline in Bitcoin price was the main factor that led to Core Scientific's earnings and margin problems. The company ran so many Bitcoin miners that incurred significant energy costs to run coupled with BTC's low price, which led to diminishing returns. Following last year's stock dilution worth $25 million, and after high-profile asset managers like BlackRock (BLK) and Ibex Investors purchased Core Scientific's convertible notes, from which the company raised $500 million in January, have the numbers improved and is the restructuring going well? Let's look at the numbers. The latest reported earnings for Q2 2023, released in August, show a total revenue of $126.9 million for Q2. Compared to earnings before going bankrupt, Core Scientific's revenue was $164 million and $162.6 million for Q2 and Q3 2022 respectively. Revenue has fallen by around 22% YoY. Analyzing the balance sheet, we see that while revenue was higher most of last year, the cost of revenue ((COR)) was also very high, resulting in negative margins. In last year's Q2 earnings report , Core Scientific attributed the increasing COR to higher power consumption costs. At the time COR was $151.3 million while total revenue was $164 million. In the following quarter (Q3), COR surpassed total revenue, apparently due to the BTC price decrease. By Q3, Core Scientific recorded a gross loss of $27.1 million. By Q4 last year, the situation worsened; gross loss increased by ~74%; COR was $168.5 million while total revenue was $121.3 million. The revenue generated couldn't cover the cost of producing Bitcoin. Presently, COR is much lower than last year's, and margins are better. This is evidently a result of the BTC price gains since the start of 2023. BTC is up over 100% YTD, which has made the miner's gross profit show a positive turnaround so far this year. While gross profit has improved, BTC has to gain more value for Core Scientific to see an improved bottom line. Net profit has been negative since Q1 last year; it has however improved since the start of this year. While a net loss of $810 million was recorded in Q2 last year, the latest reported loss was $9.3 million. This indicates significant operational improvements. I believe Core Scientific has the potential to become profitable again; however, this hinges mainly on the price performance of Bitcoin. The possible addition of the new 27,000 S19J XP Bitmain miners (when the deal is finalized between Core Scientific and Bitmain) could greatly improve mining operations for the company, and potentially reduce the cost of mining BTC. Specifications show the S19J XP miners to have potentially more mining efficiency than Core Scientific's current fleet of S19, S19 Pro, S19J, and S19J Pro Bitmain miners. S19J has a maximum hashrate of 104 Th/s for a power consumption of 3068W, compared to the new S19J XP which has a maximum hashrate of 151 Th/s for a power consumption of 3247W. The soon-to-be-acquired mining servers also work at a high-efficiency level of 21.7 Joules per TH/s, while the current fleet of miners has a power efficiency of ~29.50 J/TH. The new S19J XP mining servers will potentially add 4.1 exahashes to Core Scientific's self-mining hash rate. I expect the cost of mining BTC to slightly decrease as the new Bitmain miners are touted to be more energy efficient, potentially creating room for higher gross profit and eventually setting the stage for a strong bottom line. Risk Given the volatile nature of the crypto market and the crypto mining industry's direct correlation to crypto, investors need to acknowledge and assess the potential risks associated with investing in crypto mining stocks like CORZQ. Also, the Bitcoin halving is just months away (est. April 2024) and block rewards will be cut in half with mining difficulty adjusted. If the price of Bitcoin doesn't increase to levels that would compensate for the reduced block rewards, this will essentially translate into weaker earnings for Bitcoin mining firms, including Core Scientific. Takeaway This year, Core Scientific has demonstrated operational improvements, with reduced costs and better margins over last year's. The pending acquisition of more efficient mining equipment from Bitmain could further enhance mining operations and help the company generate more operating income. The company is on the path to an impressive comeback. However, based on my analysis, I would stay away from this stock at the moment and rather keep an eye on the efficiency gains when new mining rigs arrive, and watch how they translate into the company's bottom line before deciding to buy in the future.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4643364-core-scientific-restructuring-odyssey?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/19367593.jpeg

In the wake of the recent rally, some trading firms doubled down on their bullish positions. Related Reading: Galaxy Foresees Stellar 74% Bitcoin Price Surge In Post-ETF Debut Year As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin stands at $24,200 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency rose by over 20% the previous week, operating as the top performer in the top 10 by market capitalization. Bitcoin ETF To Trigger Larger Rally: What’s The Target? Via social media platform X, trading desk QCP Capital disclosed their positions coming into the rally. The firm longed Bitcoin volatility with options contracts, taking some profits on their positions as the cryptocurrency rallied. Still, the firm remains optimistic, holding on to their calls due to expiry in December. By then, the firm targets a BTC price above $38,000 to $44,000, based on the momentum generated by a potential Bitcoin ETF approval. In the last week, the news generated by this event has shifted market sentiment, leading investors to a more favorable area. However, the firm remains cautious about the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving a spot Bitcoin ETF in the short term. QCP Capital stated: (…) we believe the SEC will avoid playing the role of kingmaker, sticking with its own precedent set during the BTC/ETH futures ETF approval process and will wait to approve multiple managers at the same time. Nonetheless with this bullish break of 32k, we believe the market has started to price in an approval as the base case. The only question now is when the approval will happen. SEC To Avoid Kingmaking In Bitcoin ETF Approval. The trading firm believes the financial instrument will get approved in 2024. The SEC will likely avoid favoring one firm to prevent BlackRock or other asset managers from taking a large portion of the clients and the trading volume, as when the future Bitcoin ETF was approved. The firm believes the financial instrument could get approved “much later than the market expects now.” As mentioned, investors have begun pricing in any price action associated with the ETF, which could lead BTC to another range until 2024. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Surge Shakes Up ETF World: Who’s Soaring And Who’s Crashing?

19365439,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=557497,1698249659,"Shiba Inu Burn Rate Falls 80%, Is It Time To Sell?","The Shiba Inu community burn rate has seen a significant decline over the last few days. The burn rate which had been on a tear earlier in the month started to recede and has fallen double-digits in the last 24 hours alone. Given that this burn initiative was implemented to reduce supply and increase the price in the process, this decline in burn rate could have an impact on SHIB’s price performance. Shiba Inu Burn Rate Down Over 80% As data from the Shiba Inu burn tracking website, Shibburn, shows, the Shiba Inu burn rate is down more than 80% in the last day. The reason for this decline is lower participation in the burn rate, as investors have turned their focus to the surging crypto market prices. Related Reading: Bitcoin: On-Chain Tracker Points Out Interesting Difference Between Current And Past Rallies At this time, only 29.98 million SHIB have been burned. Compared to the figures from earlier in the month which often came out above 100 million tokens burned, it shows a serious lack of participation from the Shiba Inu community members. Burn rate down 80% | Source: Shibburn Burns have come from over 40 wallets but the number of SHIB each transaction was carrying was very small, hence the lackluster burn rate recorded at this time. However, on the weekly time frame, the burn rate is faring much better, as the burn tracker revealed on X (formerly Twitter) that it has seen a 61.82% increase. This means that over 362.4 million tokens were incinerated in the seven-day period. Will This Affect The SHIB Price? A look at the Shiba Inu price chart shows that the meme coin has seen a slowdown in its rally over the last day. But this has not completely eliminated the bullish tendencies that the SHIB price has shown. For example, whales are not giving up on the crypto and are instead choosing to accumulate through the twists and turns. As Bitcoinist reported, Shiba Inu whales picked up 4.52 trillion tokens from the market, which saw the price rally resume once more. This shows that these large players expect the price to continue to rally, especially in the short term, making it a good time to be in the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Pro-XRP Legal Expert Shares Expectations If SEC Wins Appeal Against Ripple However, there has been a significant decline in the excitement and participation in the SHIB token. CoinMarketCap data shows a 20.94% decrease in its daily trading volume, which suggests that sellers may be gaining ground. Nevertheless, Shiba Inu has done a good job of sticking with the Bitcoin rally. And if the leading cryptocurrency continues its upward march, Shiba Inu’s tendency to follow the same path will see its value rise despite the decrease in burn rate.

42392215,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg2tv5,1698248700,"Crypto's Darkest Hour, and the Bright Day Ahead","Perhaps you haven’t noticed but crypto has become a laughingstock in respectable traditional finance, or TradFi, circles. We have transitioned from being the smart, nouveau riche kid at the party to being the clown in the corner, with questionable personal hygiene. The ongoing criminal trial of Sam Bankman-Fried cements this narrative and puts the clown front and center. But something we should all bear in mind is that it’s always darkest before dawn, so how do we move into a new cycle of growth and optimism?  The answer is a combination of innovative technology, real-world asset adoption and the increasing involvement of grown-up institutions.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Let’s get one thing out of the way: Salvation will not come from a bitcoin (BTC) spot ETF. If you think BlackRock selling a few ETFs on centralized exchanges is the answer, then you are asking the wrong question; crypto tokens over TradFi rails is not ""the future of finance."" There is a deep irony in the fact that while JPMorgan carried out its first blockchain-based transactions with BlackRock and Barclays over its Ethereum-based Onyx blockchain, many crypto participants and speculators are still obsessing about an ETF.  We need a ""blockchain first"" mentality. It’s encouraging that recent partnerships between Chainlink and other financial institutions deliver on this premise, providing an example of the kind of meaningful innovation the industry needs. The Oracle service’s groundbreaking cross-chain interoperability protocol, or CCIP, technology will enable financial institutions to launch their own, private blockchains that interact with decentralized, public blockchains like Ethereum. Chainlink has announced projects with Swift, Google, ANZ and DTCC, among others. Indeed, this appears to be a highly plausible endgame for crypto – where financial institutions transition their rails to private blockchains used by retail and wholesale customers, while public, permissionless blockchains co-exist and provide alternative opportunities for more crypto-savvy users.  We should also remember how far we have traveled; those who do not believe financial rails can transition to blockchain should study why the transfer of value on blockchains via stablecoins surpassed both PayPal and Mastercard in 2022 (see the chart below).  We are also at the first innings of deploying real-world assets (RWAs) on the blockchain, opening out the potential for trillions of dollars of value to move on-chain. Already this year there has been over $3 billion worth of RWAs purchased through decentralized blockchains, which has created a series of cashflow-generating businesses with strong future prospects.  For example, MakerDAO, an OG of decentralized finance, or DeFi, has undergone something of a quiet revolution. Its revenues are now heavily driven by RWA yield rather than native crypto lending, as seen in the chart below. From a valuation perspective, this puts the protocol at an attractive price-to-earnings multiple of 18. Who said there is no value in crypto?!  It’s not just financial assets like real estate and government bonds that could be moved on-chain, but also whole industries like music and film royalties can benefit from transparency, fractionalization, wider access and fewer middlemen. Even the promise of ""SocialFi"" is enticing – a decentralized, transparent world of social media where users own their own data and identity, and are not beholden to the daily whims of Zuck or Elon. Base’s Friendtech, which has generated over $40 million in fees in less than 3 months of existence, may be the first iteration of this.  There really is a crypto future worth fighting for if we can just leave the clown outfit at the door.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | LINK | TECHNOLOGY,"Gary Clarke, David Moreno Darocas",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/10/25/cryptos-darkest-hour-and-the-bright-day-ahead,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dc60a9a1920dd0bec8f34981280b14794d219ed9-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42392214,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg2tpx,1698248700,Are Rising Yields Putting the Squeeze on DeFi?,"In the ever-evolving world of digital assets, Ethereum is facing the squeeze of diminishing demand amid rising U.S. Treasury yields. This is evident in the ether (ETH) staking rate, which is the reward paid to validators to support the operation of the Ethereum network. According to the Composite Ether Staking Rate (CESR) index, this rate continues to hover around 3.7% annualized, less than half the rate back in June of 8%, as rewards from fewer network transaction fees are spread across a larger number of validators.  Unfortunately, this reward from staking ether falls short of the 5% yields provided by U.S. government bonds – basically the safest assets in the world and the benchmark investment from which all other investments are evaluated within the existing financial system.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  So, are we done here? Does this shake the very foundation of the Ethereum network and eliminate the potential buoy that was keeping ether prices afloat? Through all the ups and downs of the broader CoinDesk Market Index, were ether token holders simply chasing yield? Before you reach for your cold storage wallet and fire up MetaMask, let’s dig in a bit to fill in details around this overly simplistic prevailing narrative.  It's important to acknowledge that comparing U.S. fixed income yields to ether staking yields is not exactly an apples-to-apples comparison. This is because it fundamentally juxtaposes:  a fixed nominal yield exemplified by Treasuries against an inflation-adjusted real yield  a low-risk capped price (i.e. par value) asset with a volatile growth asset  Furthermore, since last year's Ethereum Merge, there has been no significant net issuance of new ether tokens, while the U.S. Treasury has increased issuance by 25% year-over-year (as of September) to finance ever increasing budget deficits.  Putting aside this fixed nominal versus real yield growth asset income comparison, the wait times for Ethereum validators (another proxy for Ethereum demand) has reduced significantly, from 44 days in June to merely a day, according to Validator Queue. While this may indicate that the demand imbalance in the market has rectified, it may also signal a lack of overall interest in Ethereum post-Merge.  To gauge this ether demand more comprehensively, it's valuable to look across the entire decentralized finance, or DeFi, space, to examine the relative total value locked (TVL) within the Ethereum level-1 protocol and compare it to the total value locked across other competing L1 blockchains within the CoinDesk Smart Contract Platform Index. Despite the introduction of newer L1 chains and protocols, Ethereum has retained the lion's share of TVL, holding steady at 54% and fluctuating between 50% and 60% of TVL over the past two years. This is especially noteworthy considering this period includes the crypto winter.  (Source: DefiLlama)  One takeaway from the TVL data is the ongoing exodus of capital from L1 chains. TVL has shrunk from its peak of $180 billion during the height in late 2021 when the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates in response to escalating inflation. When viewed across Treasury and corporate credit market rates, it's apparent that the decline in TVL has coincided with the surge in borrowing costs and tightness in lending and credit standards, as demonstrated by the C-rated corporate bond option adjusted spread (OAS) over Treasuries.  (Source: DefiLlama, St. Louis Fed)  The correlation between weekly changes in DeFi TVL and changes in traditional finance, or TradFi, market yields is also statistically significant, with every 100-basis-point increase in real yields and the high yield C-rated OAS leading to an anticipated 14% and 4% reduction in DeFi TVL, respectively. After correcting for these TradFi yield effects, DeFi TVL still managed to grow at an average rate of 1.6% per week over this period. This relationship dynamic demonstrates that, while capital locked on-chain can be employed for various activities (i.e. yield farming, staking and trading), returns on capital are fundamentally benchmarked (and possibly financed) against the opportunity to hold relatively risk-free, short-term fixed income securities, barring the long-term risks of inflation and debasement.  While this may not bode well for the short-term prospects of L1 protocols' TVL and on-chain transaction activity, understanding the linkage between traditional markets and DeFi markets is essential for developing an actionable investment strategy for when real and nominal interest rates inevitably decline to stimulate the economy in the backdrop of an economic slowdown.  However, we may not see a zero interest rate environment come back anytime soon, as the recent sell-off in longer-dated bonds reflects a growing acknowledgment that the equilibrium rate of interest (formally known as ""R-star"" – no association with Ringo) may settle at higher levels than previous rate cycles, even after inflation aligns with the Fed's 2% target.  This higher neutral rate of interest is the equilibrium rate of interest that does not produce changes in inflation, and is shaped by factors such as technology, demographics and overall economic productivity, and may persist higher for longer than we’ve witnessed over the past decade in markets.  If digital assets and DeFi applications can produce significant value and utility to the real economy (i.e. tokenizing real-world assets), then blockchain staking rates and DeFi activities will have no problem competing for future capital against other investment opportunities within the broader traditional financial system. However, without these real-world applications and given the current trajectory of rising real yields, a giant sucking sound continues to persist in the world of DeFi.  Takeaways  From CoinDesk Deputy Editor-in-Chief Nick Baker, here is some news worth reading:  BITCOIN $35K: Flash crashes have gotten a fair amount of attention over the years. These sudden – very sudden – price drops tend to get old-school traders worked up about how computers are ruining markets. Anyway, flash rallies don't get the same attention, but, even if it wasn't really a computer-driven flash rally, what just happened with bitcoin (BTC) sure felt like one. On Monday, BTC surpassed $31,000 for the first time in months. And then, in just a few minutes, it briefly leapt above $35,000. Optimism about bitcoin ETF prospects and also options-market mechanics were some of the explanations. Whatever the cause, bitcoin has doubled in price this year and crypto is starting to feel surprisingly ebullient.  A BORING WEBSITE: Why did people get so excited about bitcoin ETFs and their odds of winning U.S. approval? A normally boring website for the normally boring Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. I've told more than one young financial journalist over the years that clearing is a vital part of financial markets, yet it's generally a dull topic, so it's important when writing about clearing to stress the former to overcome the latter. But it turns out DTCC can spark excitement! BlackRock's proposed ETF showed up on a DTCC webpage, complete with a CUSIP and ticker symbol. Crypto folks thought that was good news, maybe even a sign BlackRock's application had been approved. It definitely didn't mean that, though it's not exactly bad news that BlackRock is completing this prep work, getting a CUSIP and ticker, etc. This possibly misguided optimism likely fueled some, or maybe even most, of Monday's big bitcoin rally. But boring websites giveth and boring websites taketh away. By Tuesday, BlackRock's ETF had vanished from the DTCC site. Bitcoin fell. Later in the day, DTCC revealed something to CoinDesk that meant people probably shouldn’t have gotten so worked up this week: The BlackRock ETF has been on that page since August.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Todd Groth,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/25/are-rising-yields-putting-the-squeeze-on-defi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f8d2c7f5d12202087d5e820f42ca6df8624a8dca-5472x3648.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42392206,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg2t0f,1698247068,"Judge Denies Sam Bankman-Fried's Bid to Highlight 'Inconsistent Statements' by FTX Insiders Gary Wang, Nishad Singh","Judge Lewis Kaplan has denied a bid by Sam Bankman-Fried's defense team to let them introduce proof of ""inconsistent statements"" from former FTX executives – and prosecution witnesses – Gary Wang and Nishad Singh by bringing two FBI agents to the stand to testify.  The defense team wanted to zero in on what Wang said about stablecoin conversions and the ""allow negative"" feature that let Bankman-Fried's Alameda Research borrow essentially unlimited money from FTX. They will also home in on Singh's ""haziness"" about June and July 2022 to federal officials prior to testifying on the stand, according to a filing sent to the court early Wednesday.  The defense attorneys want to bring two FBI agents to the stand when they present their case to discuss their notes from their conversations with Singh and Wang. The notes show that certain comments the two former FTX executives made on the stand do not match the notes of their conversations from months before the trial begin.  ""On October 21, Mr. Bankman-Fried’s counsel advised the Government that it would seek to introduce evidence of Mr. Wang’s and Mr. Singh’s prior inconsistent statements,"" the defense filing said.  Wang testified during trial that he could not remember if he spoke to Alameda's role as a market maker, which was not what he told investigators in November 2022, the letter said. He similarly did not remember telling investigators about stablecoin conversions being part of that market making function in December of last year.  Singh made inconsistent statements about how well he remembered the events of June and July 2022, the letter said. Similarly, he did not recall telling investigators if he said he felt OK about buying a house after the collapse of FTX in January.  ""Mr. Wang's and Mr. Singh's denials of having made, or proclaimed inability to recall having made, the above-noted statements go to their credibility in the case,"" the letter said.  Defense attorneys tried to pin Wang and Singh on these inconsistent statements during their cross examinations of the two former FTX executives, though they couldn't get into detail on those statements at the time.  The DOJ opposed the move, saying in a filing that the former executives' testimony was not inconsistent with the notes the FBI agents took.  ""Perhaps most importantly, the defendant seeks to offer the interview notes indicating that Mr. Wang described the allow negative flag as being part of Alameda’s market making function, but Mr. Wang never denied, in substance, that the allow negative flag was added as part of Alameda’s market making function,"" the DOJ filing said about Wang's testimony.  The defense's other example was similarly not inconsistent for Wang, the DOJ filing said.  As far as Singh goes, the DOJ made similar arguments that that notes an FBI agent took are not inconsistent with what the onetime FTX executive said on the stand.

19363665,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=557485,1698246053,Cardano Founder Debunks Rumors Of Stablecoin Djed’s Shutdown,"In a definitive response to swirling rumors regarding the possible discontinuation of the Djed stablecoin, Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano, firmly stated that not only will the project continue, but it will also receive a significant upgrade. “No, we aren’t dropping Djed. We are supercharging the team,” he announced. Cardano Developer IOG Doubles Down On Djed Djed, an overcollateralized stablecoin by Input Output Global (IOG) and COTI has been under scrutiny due to its unique financial mechanism recently. Specifically, the stablecoin uses Cardano’s ADA token as a reserve, aiming to maintain a circulating supply backed by four times the number of its outstanding coins. While designed to provide enhanced security and stability for its users, recent metrics indicated the reserves had decreased to 356%, prompting a temporary suspension of minting new Djed tokens. Related Reading: Cardano Passes Crucial Update As ADA Price Prepares For 65% Rally In the midst of this, IOG issued a series of statements indicating structural changes and expansions. Hoskinson tweeted about the addition of Sean Ford, noting, “Glad to welcome my good friend Sean Ford to the IOG family.” This was in conjunction with IOG’s formal announcement, detailing the appointment of Sean Ford as CEO and David Markley as COO of a newly formed subsidiary concentrating on the stablecoin sector. Ford’s credentials in the technology sector are quite noteworthy, having been part of the founding team at Algorand where he served in both COO and CEO capacities. Additionally, David Markley, before joining IOG, was deeply entrenched in Algorand’s Operations, Venture, and Business Solutions teams. Articulating his vision for the evolving stablecoin sector, Ford stated, “The stablecoin space is rapidly evolving as the next frontier in digital asset payments, settlement, and innovation. I am excited to engage with the IOG team and the broader blockchain, stablecoin, and crypto community as we work collectively to create and launch the next generation of stable assets.” Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Lists Reasons Why Cardano (ADA) Will Not Do Well In The Bull Market Hoskinson, reflecting on his long-standing involvement in the field, emphasized the necessity of stablecoins for the blockchain industry. Drawing attention to his work from BitShares to Djed, he said, “The blockchain industry needs stablecoins to realize its mission and fully protect its values. I’m incredibly proud to welcome my friend Sean Ford to lead a new venture to develop stablecoins and other payment solutions alongside their supporting ecosystems.” These developments suggest a recalibration of the Djed project under new leadership. With firm support from the Cardano ecosystem, Djed could make a new attempt to conquer a part of the huge stablecoin market in the crypto sector. ADA Breaks The Downtrend Last Saturday, the ADA price managed to break above a descending trend line that has its origin in mid-April, when ADA reached its high for the year at $0.463. Since then, ADA has been in a downtrend, which may now be coming to an end, as discussed in our latest analysis. The Cardano price has recaptured the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level on the 1-day chart and is now close to the extremely important 200-day EMA at $0.298.

42392213,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg2tkp,1698246000,This Cybersecurity Pro Gets Paid to Hack Ethereum – for the Good of the Network,"A typical day for David Theodore, a security researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, often starts with him checking to see if there were any crashes on Ethereum, the world’s largest smart-contracts blockchain.  After that, he and his colleagues set about trying to break it themselves.  “Our goal is to break things hopefully before anyone else breaks them, so there's nothing else left to break,” Theodore told CoinDesk in an interview.  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Theodore, 33, is one of about 10 computer engineers and cybersecurity professionals on the Ethereum Foundation’s security research team, based on a slide presentation from June. They cast themselves as the ultimate maintainers – and guardians – of the fast-growing network, seen by some blockchain experts as the foundation of a future global, digital, and decentralized financial system.  The Ethereum Foundation, created by the blockchain’s famous founder, Vitalik Buterin, and set up to support development of the network, boasts a workforce of roughly 150 people, according to the slide presentation. Most of the focus is on constant programming upgrades, growth initiatives, sponsoring developer conferences and providing grants.  So this squad of security researchers represents just a sliver of the foundation’s overall operations. But in a crypto industry renowned for pushing out new protocols and applications that later prove vulnerable to expensive exploits, the team’s role could not be more crucial: Hackers are always looking for new points of attack, and a single slip-up could result in a devastating blow to a blockchain’s reputation as a safe place to transact.  'Always fuzzing'  The team members come from a wide array of backgrounds and specializations – many of them with computer science degrees, but experience in responding to exploits, attacking distributed systems and the applying cryptography.  One of the techniques that the security team deploys to protect the blockchain is “fuzzing,” a term borrowed from the software-development industry that’s become a common way of checking to make sure a system is secure and resilient.  Translated to the context of working on Ethereum, members of the security team feed invalid inputs into network nodes to reveal bugs or vulnerabilities in the software. The point of fuzzing is to see if there are any negative reactions to the system.  “We're always fuzzing. We have big supercomputers fuzzing all the time,” Theodore told CoinDesk. “They're fuzzing everything, while you work, while you sleep.”  Life of an Ethereum security researcher  In 24/7 crypto, a day in the life for Theodore always looks a little bit different.  “If you see panics or errors of any kind, anything that looks like there's failures,"" he says, ""you go look at them and you say, ‘Is this a problem because of my fuzzer or is this a problem that an attacker could make the same problem?’”  Based in Austin, Texas, Theodore sometimes takes his office on the road – in an Airstream recreational vehicle with a dedicated office that allows him to keep fuzzing even when parked in remote locales.  The portable office fits two big monitors and connects to the outside world via Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite internet service. The space is big enough for two people and a dog to inhabit comfortably, Theodore says.  In late 2022, the Airstream served as his base, parked in Granby, Colorado, in the shadow of Rocky Mountain National Park, as Ethereum developers were pushing toward a milestone known as the “Merge” – when the project transitioned to a more energy-efficient “proof-of-stake” network from the “proof-of-work” system used by Bitcoin, the original blockchain.  “We were there for a month before the Merge,” Theodore recalled. It was a convenient location, since he could easily travel to Boulder, Colorado, to meet up with other Ethereum Foundation team members to witness the historic event.  Theodore studied electrical engineering at the University of Texas at Arlington, but after graduation, pivoted to a career in cybersecurity. He spent the early part of his career in the offensive cybersecurity unit at Raytheon, before eventually moving to data forensics firm SkySafe and then to tech giant Google in 2020.  He joined the Ethereum Foundation in 2021 after learning that the organization was forming a security team. Initially, his role was to research how to protect the blockchain during the transition to proof-of-stake.  Since then, the job has evolved to a broader mandate of maintaining the integrity of the network.  “They wanted to make a team that specializes in this kind of thing, the ins and outs of how nation states fund these cyber operations and how they go about them,” Theodore told CoinDesk. The foundation recruited members that could “apply that methodology here and stay a step ahead and try to make Ethereum robust.”  In June, Theodore delivered a presentation about the Ethereum Foundation security research team to a group of Austin crypto developers, listing responsibilities including “general hardfork security,” “beaconchain health,” bug bounty programs, “client security coordination,” and “client diversity advocacy.”  “Our team has found bugs in every CL and EL client and more,” according to one of the presentation slides. “CL” stands for Ethereum’s consensus layer, where validators of the blockchain are hosted and verified, and “EL” stands for the blockchain’s execution layer, where transactions are completed and the state of the blockchain is recorded and managed.  His job is quite untraditional compared to other cybersecurity officials, he says – partly because the organization adheres to a more horizontal management structure, and also because the job can be done from pretty much anywhere.  Ethereum, renowned for its “smart contracts” that allow for programmability and the hosting of decentralized applications, has expanded rapidly, especially now that it serves as the confirmation and settlement hub – the ""layer 1"" or ""L1"" – for an array of “layer-2” blockchains that work atop of it, such as Arbitrum, Optimism and the crypto exchange Coinbase’s new Base blockchain.  And as more value is accrued on the network, Theodore believes that the team’s security mandate will grow in importance.  The total market capitalization of Ethereum’s native ether (ETH) tokens currently stands at about $212 billion.  “I think we're critical,” Theodore shared. “The most that is synonymous with security, if you're talking about block space, is the Ethereum L1.”",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | RESEARCH | ARB,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/10/25/this-cybersecurity-pro-gets-paid-to-hack-ethereum-for-the-good-of-the-network,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5e8e17695a48078561138b5d0bd087a68a213a71-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42392198,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg2sQl,1698244754,Sam Bankman-Fried to Testify at His Criminal Trial as Soon as Thursday,"FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried has decided to testify in his criminal trial, a direct appeal to jurors in his bid to prove he did not commit fraud or conspire to commit fraud at his once-giant cryptocurrency exchange, his defense attorneys said during a Wednesday teleconference.  Bankman-Fried will begin testifying as soon as Thursday, his team said.  Bankman-Fried has a history of expressing his views, especially after the collapse of FTX. He gave interviews to reporters, started a Substack newsletter and posted a number of tweets trying to explain his exchange's downfall in the weeks after the company filed for bankruptcy.  Bankman-Fried went so far as to go on a media tour to make his case that he was innocent. But FTX insiders have, during the trial, painted a different picture: Bankman-Fried, they have testified, was pulling the strings of the alleged fraud at the crypto exchange.  The defense team also said during the Wednesday teleconference they planned to call just a handful of witnesses alongside Bankman-Fried, including financial services expert Joseph Pimbley, who works at PF2 Securities, to testify in Bankman-Fried's favor. A Bahamas lawyer may also testify, lead defense attorney Mark Cohen said.  The prosecution expects to finish calling witness within an hour of Thursday's court session beginning, after calling just one more witness, FBI agent Mark Troiano, Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicholas Roos said during the teleconference.  The move comes as Bankman-Fried's defense prepares to begin calling witnesses after prosecutors spent three weeks laying out their argument that he defrauded FTX's customers and Alameda Research's investors, and conspired with his fellow executives to hide his crimes and continue misusing those funds.  Those executives, including Caroline Ellison, Nishad Singh and Gary Wang, testified against him after pleading guilty to various crimes of their own, with the defense mostly mounting seemingly unimpressive cross-examinations in their bid to sow doubt about the strength of the witnesses' testimony. In a separate filing Wednesday, the defense attorneys sought permission to introduce evidence that Singh and Wang had been inconsistent in how they described their conversations with investigators prior to getting on the stand.  Now, Bankman-Fried is going to describe his version of events to the 12 jurors and six alternates who will be asked to decide if he's guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  While the U.S. Department of Justice must prove that Bankman-Fried actually met the statutory requirements of the different crimes he's accused of beyond a reasonable doubt, the defense only has to prove Bankman-Fried not guilty to that standard.  Famous defendants have begun testifying in their own defenses, an attorney following the case told CoinDesk last month.  ""There's an emerging trend now in these high profile white collar crime cases for defendants to waive their fifth amendment and testify in a way that never would have happened even 10 years ago, let alone 20 or 30,"" the attorney, who asked for their name to be withheld, said.  Part of this comes from defenses anticipating their juries to research the defendant, regardless of a judge's instructions not to do that.  ""You look at Elizabeth Holmes, you look at some of these other cases like that, the thinking now goes that juries are so celebrity-conscious that even if they didn't know who they were trying, they're almost all probably going on Twitter and going online, to research him during the trial,"" the attorney said.

Open-sourcing code is at the core of the blockchain ethos, bringing transparency for developers thatallows them to conduct reviews, detect bugs and improve the quality.  If the proposal is accepted by the community and passes a governance vote, then the blockchain’s new main network or “mainnet” will go live.  According to dYdX Trading Inc., the initial developer behind the exchange, the v4 upgrade will make the exchange fully decentralized and community operated, meaning that the company will no longer control the protocol and will not collect trading fees, according to a press release seen by CoinDesk.  “I think it's a really exciting moment, to take something that in DeFi that already has a product market fit, where there is a billion dollars traded on average on dYdX every day, and fully decentralize it on a fundamentally new technology stack,” Antonio Juliano, dYdX’s Trading founder and CEO, told CoinDesk in an interview. “I think that's something that hasn't really happened to that level in crypto yet.”  After v4 goes live on mainnet, changes to the stack will be done through governance votes by the community through the dYdX Foundation.

According to data from Messari, SOL’s market capitalization surged over 60%, solidifying its position among the top ten crypto assets. This rally comes after a challenging period for SOL bulls who struggled to maintain support at the $20 mark, not to mention the significant drop to $8 following the FTX exchange implosion in November. The price of major ecosystem tokens has recently been on the rise. Solana in particular has experienced a nearly 55% price appreciation over the last 30 days.

Although there has been a slight 0.4% dip in the last 24 hours, the cryptocurrency has shown an impressive seven-day rally, with a gain of 30.2%. To put this in perspective, the last time SOL was trading at a similar price level was in November 2022, just before the FTX exchange incident shook the market. The surge in SOL’s price can be attributed to the overall bullish momentum in the cryptocurrency market over the past few weeks. Data from Santiment reveals that SOL’s daily trading volume has surged by more than 30% since October 16. This increased trading activity indicates growing investor interest and confidence in Solana’s potential. Source: Santiment A closer look at the momentum indicators on a daily chart highlights the significant accumulation of SOL compared to distribution among spot traders. This indicates that buying activity has been outpacing profit-taking activity, contributing to the sustained rally in SOL’s price. However, it’s important to note that these indicators also suggest that the cryptocurrency has become overbought and may be due for a correction. Investors should remain cautious and monitor the market closely in light of this overbought signal.

This highlights the blockchain’s versatility and its potential to reshape the landscape of decentralized finance and applications in the near future. Solana’s recent surge in market capitalization and price is indicative of the cryptocurrency’s growing prominence in the digital asset landscape.

42392210,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg2tVR,1698241380,Bitcoin Is Up 100% This Year. It's Not Just Because of Spot BTC ETF Hype,"Bitcoin rallied past $34,000 this week, and is up 106% so far this year after 2022's grueling grind lower.  The latest surge supposedly happened on excitement around a potential spot ETF approval, but are other factors at work?  Constrained supply, underinvested market participants and bitcoin's rejuvenated shine as a safe haven from troubled traditional markets and geopolitical turmoil are catalysts worth considering.  Bitcoin [BTC] managed a monster rally over the past week on two spot ETF stories that turned out to be complete fugazis. That the price has barely pulled back even after the fake news was outed suggests maybe it’s not ETF anticipation driving the surge higher.  To review, bitcoin – plodding along in a very tight range of roughly $27,000-$28,000 for weeks on end – was jolted above $30,000 ten days ago after a media outlet tweeted that BlackRock’s spot ETF application had won U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval. Within minutes, the tweet had been revealed as a mistake and bitcoin quickly gave back some, but not all of its gains.  Then early this week, some observers noticed the ticker for BlackRock’s spot bitcoin ETF – IBTC – showed up on trading clearinghouse DTCC’s website. Market participants read the news as signaling imminent SEC approval of the fund. The bullish signal caught shorts and dealers off guard, leading to a price spike to $35,000 Monday evening.  By Tuesday evening though, it was revealed that the IBTC ticker had been on the DTCC site for months and meant literally nothing with respect to whether a spot bitcoin ETF might be coming or not.  Yet the price of bitcoin remains very close to Monday’s high and at the current $34,400 is ahead nearly 30% over the past 10 days and more than 100% for 2023.  If not an ETF, then what?  ""​​We now have the biggest asset managers in the world trumpeting bitcoin as a 'flight to quality' amidst devaluing fiat currencies and mounting global tensions and war. You couldn’t ask for more.""  Some analysts argue that bitcoin is in demand as a safe-haven asset, noting prolific government spending and associated rising debt levels, shaky stock and bond markets, and the crypto’s increasingly constrained supply.  ""​​We now have the biggest asset managers in the world trumpeting bitcoin as a 'flight to quality' amidst devaluing fiat currencies and mounting global tensions and war,"" said Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments. ""You couldn’t ask for more.""  ""After 2022 tricked so many into thinking that digital assets are correlated to stocks and bonds, many are left scratching their heads at the 'new' old normal,"" Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca pointed out. ""A debt spiral leads to a loss of confidence in banks and governments and a repricing of risk-free rates amidst record supply, which is bad for bonds and equity valuation models, but good for alternative forms of wealth and money creation,"" he added.  Hedge fund giant Paul Tudor Jones touted gold and BTC as attractive investment options while geopolitical risk and ""untenable"" U.S. debt levels make it difficult to own stocks.  As the classic 60% stocks, 40% bonds portfolio is enduring one of its worst periods, an uncorrelated asset like BTC could be a potent contender to diversify, K33 Research and CoinShares argued separately.  Banking woes in U.S. and China  In March, bitcoin jumped from $20,000 to around $28,000 during the regional banking crisis in the U.S., which saw the downfall of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, among others.  The recent crisis in the Chinese shadow banking system may also have helped bitcoin in a similar manner, Switzerland-based investment manager 21Shares noted in a report last week.  The report explained that following the bankruptcy of Chinese real estate giants Evergrande and Sunac, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) earlier this month injected the equivalent of over $100 billion, the most in three years, in lending facilities to shore up liquidity in the banking system.  When the PBOC intervened in January 2020 by lowering the deposit reserve ratio for financial institutions, equivalent to a $115 billion capital boost for the Chinese economy, BTC gained 13% and active Bitcoin addresses rose by 48%, the report pointed out.  As long-term bond yields have surged to near 5%, some banks are sitting on massive amounts of unrealized losses on bonds fueling concerns about the health of the U.S. banking system.  Indeed, Bank of America (BAC) last week reported Q3 losses of $131 billion in its held-to-maturity (HTM) portfolio. Stock market investors have taken notice, driving BAC’s share price down nearly 8% over the past five sessions and 24% year-to-date.  ""Banking crises have oftentimes prompted people to resort to bitcoin as a flight to quality, amplifying crypto’s use case as a hedge in evolving macroeconomic ramifications and an evolving geopolitical landscape,"" 21Shares analysts wrote.  Spot BTC ETF still could be a major catalyst  Despite the high odds for a spot BTC ETF, many market participants have slept on a potential upside move in BTC's price, according to Alex Thorn, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital.  ""A lot of people were not positioned well for a rally,"" Thorn said in a Tuesday interview with CoinDesk TV at the State of Crypto conference in Washington, D.C.  This week's surge found options dealers off-side, contributing to the explosiveness of the price action, Thorn noted earlier this week.  Historically illiquid markets and all-time high amounts of bitcoin held by long-term investors laid ground for a supply shock, he added.  Almost 70% of bitcoin's supply hasn't moved in a year, and 30% of outstanding tokens haven't change hands in five years, Glassnode data shows.  ""We all underestimated just how underinvested investors are in digital assets, and how little new money is needed to cause significant swings in price,"" said Arca’s Dorman.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/25/bitcoin-is-up-100-this-year-its-not-just-because-of-spot-btc-etf-hype,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f634322c2838d8071be91a491f2c8a2c748cac7f-2400x1256.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The world’s largest crypto saw an 18% increase in the past seven days, its highest percentage increase this year. This unexpected surge caused a flurry of short position liquidations, and according to Glassnode, 60,000 BTC worth of futures positions were closed. Amidst all the price surge, data from Glassnode has shown a large portion of investors are now breaking above profit. Bitcoin Surges Past $35,000, Flipping Millions of Coins Into Profit Bitcoin bulls managed to push Bitcoin price above $35,100 in the past 24 hours, marking the biggest one-day increase this year. The upward movement began near the $25,000 level and continued until it reached its new yearly high. Related Reading: Bitcoin Spot ETF Approval: Why Price Could Be Set For 300% Surge A blockchain analytics platform Glassnode report showed that Bitcoin zooming past $35,000 is a big deal for holders. At this price level, millions of BTC holdings were pushed into profitability. During this rally, the percent of supply in profit from the $25,000 to $35,000 price jump increased by a massive 4.7M BTC, equivalent to 24% of the total circulating supply. Long-term investors, in particular, had a big break in profit at this price point. Although approximately 29.6% of long-term holder supply is still held at a loss, their aggregate holdings recently broke into a new all-time high of 14.899 million BTC. Source: Glassnode Short-term holders were also not left out, as investor confidence has recovered from bearish to neutral on the cost-basis models. We’re now at a crossover point to a positive bullish sentiment for short-term holders. A look into the average buy price of short-term holders puts the majority of entry into the market at $28,000, indicating a profit margin for both short and long-term traders. Source: Glassnode What’s Behind Bitcoin’s Sudden Price Surge? The sudden surge in Bitcoin can be attributed to the excitement behind the approval of BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETFs application. Bitcoin backers pointed to the listing of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust on the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) website, suggesting that BlackRock had begun seeding money for the ETF. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) Surge Far From Done As Crypto Analyst Predicts Rise To $15 Although Bitcoin has since shed off some of this price gain and is now trading at $33,860 at the time of this writing, metrics show that 80% of holders are making money at the current price. Exchange signals also point to bullish momentum, as traders are now exchanging their assets for BTC on crypto exchanges. The rise in the value of Bitcoin to $35,000 was reflected in the stock prices of crypto-related companies like Coinbase and MicroStrategy. At that price, MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings would have generated a profit of $857 million for the company.

42392234,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg36k5,1698236201,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Retreats Slightly; FTX Receives Bids for Restart,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin is down slightly Wednesday after dropping more than 3% from its perch near $35,000 late Tuesday morning as the ticker for BlackRock's (BLK) spot bitcoin ETF – IBTC – was removed from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation's (DTCC) website. The ticker's appearance on the DTCC site – rightly or wrongly – had investors speculating about imminent approval for a spot bitcoin ETF, thus playing a factor in BTC's sharp gain from the $30,000 area to more than $35,000. The cryptocurrency was trading at around $34,200 at the time of writing and was still up over 20% over the last seven days. “What we are potentially seeing is a permanent thawing of so-called ‘crypto winters.’,” said Diogo Monica, co-founder and president of Anchorage Digital. “While the digital asset market will always have bulls and bears, institutional adoption is pushing us closer to perpetual spring.”  Bankrupt crypto exchange FTX has received multiple bids for a potential restart, investment banker Kevin Cofsky of Perella Weinberg Partners said Tuesday during a court hearing. At least three bidders are in the running to buy the exchange, which traded tens of billions of dollars a day at its peak. A decision could potentially be made by mid-December, as part of plans to be submitted to the Delaware bankruptcy court for approval. Cofsky's testimony contributed to a successful bid to keep the platform’s list of over 9 million customers secret, given that such information might prove valuable to a potential buyer. “We’ve narrowed the field from a large number to a smaller number in what we’re calling our second round,” Cofsky said at the court hearing, referring to the parties with whom he's discussing wind-up options. “I am optimistic that we will have either a plan for a reorganized exchange, a partnership agreement or a stalking horse for a sale, on or prior to the December 16 milestone date.”  Spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could attract at least $14.4 billion of inflows in the first year of issuance, crypto fund Galaxy Digital said in a research note on Tuesday. An ETF could be a better investment vehicle for investors compared to currently offered products, such as trusts and futures, which hold over $21 billion in value, the fund said. The inflows could ramp up by $27 billion by the second year and $39 billion by the third year, it added. “The U.S. wealth management industry will likely be the most addressable and direct market that would have the most net new accessibility from an approved Bitcoin ETF,” the note read. “As of October 2023, assets managed by broker-dealers ($27 trillion), banks ($11 trillion) and RIAs ($9 trillion) collectively totaled $48.3 trillion.”  Chart of The Day  The chart shows solana-bitcoin (SOLUSD/BTCUSD) ratio since early 2021.

The funding round drew participation from other prominent investors in the Ethereum ecosystem, including Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, Bankless Ventures, HackVC and Robot Ventures.  The money will be used to continue the development of the blockchain but also pay legal bills, Luke Tchang, the co-founder and CEO of Nocturne Labs told CoinDesk in an interview.  The Nocturne protocol is expected to launch during the second half of November, combining blockchain technologies like zero-knowledge proofs, account abstractions and stealth addresses to bring private accounts to public blockchain.  According to a press release, the accounts “function like conventional Ethereum accounts, but with built-in asset privacy.”  Nocturne could compete with other privacy-focused protocols such as Aztec or Railgun, Tchang said.  “People have kind of been afraid of the space for regulatory reasons. We're kind of the belief that there's a way to do this the right way and being measured along the way and speaking with regulators,” Tchang told CoinDesk. “This is of course still possible.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) expanded its alert list for non-compliant firms, adding a whopping 221 companies since a new marketing regime took effect on Oct. 8. The new rules require crypto service providers to either put in the work to get registered with the regulator or ask an authorized firm to approve their communications to local clients.  The FCA highlighted ""common issues"" it has noticed with crypto promos in a Wednesday post, just weeks after blocking unregistered firm Binance's chosen ad approver from greenlighting any crypto-related communications. As a result, the world's largest crypto exchange stopped onboarding new clients in the country.  Wednesday's post referred to the action against the approver, Rebuildingsociety.com, and tells authorizers to watch out for claims of ""security"" or ""safety"" without adequate risk warnings, and to make sure warnings are not in ""small fonts, hard-to-read coloring or non-prominent positioning.""  ""We expect authorized firms approving the financial promotions of cryptoasset firms to take their regulatory obligations seriously,"" the FCA said, adding that it's working with social media platforms, apps, search engines and other entities to block illegal promotions in the country.  ""We are also working with payments firms to limit U.K. consumer exposure to firms issuing illegal promotions. These businesses should consider the alerts we have issued and play their part in protecting U.K. consumers,"" the post said.

Growth in SOL tokens came as traders downplayed fears of a looming sell-off by the FTX bankruptcy estate.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based tracker of hundreds of tokens, rose 0.42%, suggesting slight gains across the overall market.  Meanwhile, some traders said signs of institutional adoption may be an indication of the end of ‘crypto winter’ – a colloquial term for a bear market characterized by lower prices and little venture capital investments.  “What we are potentially seeing is a permanent thawing of so-called ‘crypto winters.’ While the digital asset market will always have bulls and bears, institutional adoption is pushing us closer to perpetual spring,” shared Diogo Mónica, co-founder at Anchorage Digital, referring to the many spot ETF applications.  “Between recent price action and movement toward spot Bitcoin ETF approval, the long-term outlook for Bitcoin is the most promising it has been in recent memory—and institutions are just getting started,” Mónica added.  Elsewhere, crypto trading firm QCP Capital said in a Telegram broadcast that the anticipation of a spot bitcoin ETF was currently driving outsized demand for the asset.  “Steps taken by Blackrock, including a DTCC listing and tickerization (IBTC), gave the market hope that the SEC approval is imminent,” QCP said. “However, we do not think that this signals an impending SEC decision in the coming week.”  “Instead, we believe the SEC will avoid playing the role of kingmaker, sticking with its own precedent set during the BTC/ETH futures ETF approval process and will wait to approve multiple managers at the same time,” the firm opined.",NEUTRAL,BTC | SOL,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | SOL | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/25/bitcoin-hovers-over-34k-as-blackrock-ibtc-ticker-euphoria-fades-out,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f1820368dbf46cb6d80d46f9a07c9d96d2966155-1280x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42392236,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg36uL,1698230724,Crypto Fear & Greed Index Hits Highest Since November 2021,"A key gauge of investor sentiment suggests the crypto market may take a bull breather.  The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has jumped to 70.6, the highest since November 2021, according to data source alternative.me. The index, which ranges from 0 to 100, uses several metrics, including market momentum, volatility, volume and social media, to analyze and measure market sentiment for bitcoin and prominent alternative cryptocurrencies.  Values between 50 and 74 signal ""greed,"" while readings above 75 indicate ""extreme greed."" The higher the score, the more confident investors feel about bitcoin's prospects.  Savvy traders prefer buying when the index signals extreme fear, and become cautious when it signals investor greed. As legendary investor Warren Buffett once said: ""It's wise for investors to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful.""  In other words, bitcoin [BTC] could see a pause in the bullish run that has seen it gain 28% in less than two weeks.  The leading cryptocurrency's relative strength index also suggests the same. The RSI shows an above-70, or overbought, reading. Overbought readings on the RSI often presage bull market breathers.  Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, touched a 17-month high above $35,000 earlier this week, predominantly on the back of spot ETF speculation. The total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies has surged to $1.26 trillion from $1.01 trillion two weeks ago.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/25/crypto-fear-greed-index-hits-highest-since-november-2021,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ebb504a140dc0adbcdc0f223a7ef06f058c98fed-1316x740.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
19355764,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=557466,1698230716,"Shiba Inu Price Prints Rare Buy Signal, What You Need To Know","Amid the bullish sentiment in the crypto market, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has recently garnered significant attention from traders and investors. A recent analysis by renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez has spotlighted a rare buy signal for the token, potentially hinting at an upward trajectory for its price. Buy Shiba Inu Now? For those not familiar, the TD Sequential is an indicator used by traders to identify potential price patterns and reversals. Developed by Tom DeMark, the TD Sequential is a series of numbers and letters that represent specific counts on a price chart. When the count reaches a ‘9’ (TD9), it typically suggests a potential reversal in the market’s current trend, whether bullish or bearish. Its utility in predicting market turns has made it a staple in many traders’ toolkits, especially in the realm of cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: This Shibarium Milestone Could Rocket Shiba Inu To August Highs Ali Martinez, in a recent tweet, pointed out that the TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the Shiba Inu’s weekly chart. Such an occurrence isn’t just significant due to the potential for a bullish turn but also because of the infrequency of these signals. Historical data analysis reveals that in the last two instances when such a buy signal manifested, the SHIB price surged by 118% and 71%, respectively. These past performances, while no guarantee of future results, do provide a tantalizing backdrop to the current scenario. Martinez stated: The TD Sequential flashed a buy signal on [the] SHIB weekly chart. Notably, the previous two bullish turns from this indicator led to price surges of 118% and 71%, respectively. Given the infrequency yet precision of such signals, it’s a pivotal moment to keep a keen eye on SHIB. The TradingView chart, shared by Martinez, outlines the SHIB/TetherUS (USDT) Perpetual Contract on the Binance platform. It shows that back in June 2022, Shiba Inu recorded an impressive surge of approximately 117.80% within eight weeks. This rally was preceded by a ‘9’ candlestick on the TD Sequential indicator, hinting at the buy setup. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Lead Dev Kusama Breaks Silence With Major Updates In late September 2023, another TD Sequential ‘9’ buy signal emerged, resulting in a 71.17% ascent in SHIB’s value within the subsequent nine weeks. As of October 25, 2023, yet another ‘9’ buy setup has manifested on the weekly time frame. Given the token’s historical reaction to these setups, a bullish move seems likely. However, while the TD Sequential is a respected tool, it’s worth noting that all indicators should be used in conjunction with other tools and analysis methods. The volatile nature of the crypto market means that predictions, even when based on historically successful indicators, come with inherent risks. A Consistent Signal At press time, the Shiba Inu price was trading at $0.00000732 and has thus managed to recapture the neckline of the descending triangle in the weekly chart. As detailed in earlier analysis, SHIB was in a make-or-break moment in the last two weeks. However, since SHIB was able to bounce above the neckline, the bullish scenario has now come to the fore. As was the case from June to early August 2022 after the formation of the third bottom (yellow circle), SHIB could now rally again towards the descending trend line of the triangle as a result of the fourth bottom (second yellow circle). Thus, the TD9 signal and this technical pattern coincide. As then, however, a new decisive moment would come for the Shiba Inu price – the battle to break out of a more than 2-year downtrend.

At least three bidders are in the running to buy the exchange, which traded tens of billions of dollars a day at its peak.  Latest News: Sam Bankman-Fried Will Take the Stand in His Own Defense  A decision will be potentially made by mid-December, as part of plans to be submitted to the Delaware bankruptcy court for approval. Cofsky's testimony contributed to a successful bid to keep the platform's list of over 9 million customers secret, given that such information might prove valuable to a potential buyer.  “We’ve narrowed the field from a large number to a smaller number in what we’re calling our second round,” Cofsky said at the court hearing, referring to the parties with whom he's discussing wind-up options. “I am optimistic that we will have either a plan for a reorganized exchange, a partnership agreement or a stalking horse for a sale, on or prior to the December 16 milestone date.”  FTX collapsed last November after CoinDesk published revelations concerning the state of its balance sheet. New CEO John J. Ray III has excoriated financial controls at the company, and founder Sam Bankman-Fried is on trial for criminal charges.

42392220,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg35fP,1698228000,Sam Bankman-Fried's Defense May Depend on Character and Fact Witnesses,"Sam Bankman-Fried's presentation in court won't kick off until later this week, but it's already clear his defense may hinge on one key witness: himself.  You're reading The SBF Trial, a CoinDesk newsletter bringing you daily insights from inside the courtroom where Sam Bankman-Fried will try to stay out of prison. Want to receive it directly? Sign up here.  That's according to Kevin O’Brien, a partner at Ford O'Brien LLP and a former assistant U.S. attorney who specializes in white collar criminal cases.  Latest News: Sam Bankman-Fried Will Take the Stand in His Own Defense  ""SBF is the defense case, for better or for worse,"" O’Brien told CoinDesk. ""The case thus far appears to have not gone well for him [and] I doubt the defense will have any other substantial witnesses.""  Weeks ago, Bankman-Fried’s lawyers filed their proposed list of expert witnesses – a roster that included several law experts, a finance professor and a data analytics and forensics specialist. However, Judge Lewis Kaplan, who's overseeing the case, granted the prosecution’s request to bar those witnesses for a variety of reasons, including arguments that the witnesses’ testimony would be tangential to the case and that the witnesses themselves were unfit to testify in a U.S. criminal trial.  He did allow the defense to pitch four of the proposed expert witnesses again.  A recent court filing shows the defense plans to call at least six witnesses to the stand. One of those witnesses will likely be the sole proposed expert witness, Joseph Pimbley, a financial services expert and consultant who will testify about FTX and Alameda's financials. The identities of the remaining five witnesses have not yet been shared.  It is possible many of the remaining five will be character witnesses, or individuals who could attest to the defendant’s moral scruples and conduct, rather than witnesses who are called up to verify the facts of the case, such as Ryan Salame or other members of Bankman-Fried’s inner-circle, O'Brien said.  That’s because, according to O’Brien, any helpful fact witnesses would likely need to plead the fifth should the prosecution attempt to compel them to produce potentially damning evidence against Bankman-Fried.  And while pleading the fifth cannot, on its own, be used as evidence in a criminal trial, it could be a bad look for the defense. According to the FindLaw blog, jurors “tend to make an adverse inference against anyone who pleads the fifth.”  — Elizabeth Napolitano  What we're expecting  We now know the defense may call on a number of witnesses when the trial resumes tomorrow. While we still don't know most of their identities, they may be asked to verify that Bankman-Fried did not intend (or conspire) to commit fraud, that he was unaware of the extent of problems at his companies or that FTX was not able to borrow user funds.  As always, we'll look to the jury to see if these arguments have any impact.  Separately, on Tuesday, the DOJ and defense engaged in a further back-and-forth over jury instructions (following last week's filings). Judge Lewis Kaplan has tended to let parties argue verbally in court rather than strictly rely on paperwork, so while we may see an order before trial resumes Thursday, it seems far more likely that he'll take a few minutes at the start or end of the trial day to hear the parties' concerns before ruling.  — Nikhilesh De",NEUTRAL,없음,REGULATION,"Elizabeth Napolitano, Nikhilesh De",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/25/sam-bankman-frieds-defense-may-depend-on-character-and-fact-witnesses,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/84d3ca7ee2a1134decf42c38bcf6e637ea645d1f-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

SEC Can Still Bring Claims Against Ripple’s Executives In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Rispoli noted that the SEC could still file another lawsuit against Garlinghouse and Larsen if they were to appeal Judge Torres’ ruling on the programmatic sales and other distributions and get a judgment in their favor. Related Reading: Bitcoin Spot ETF Approval: Why Price Could Be Set For 300% Surge His assumption is based on the fact that the Judge’s latest order showed that the SEC only dismissed the claims against them with respect to the institutional sales, as the Commission had alleged that both Garlinghouse and Larsen aided and abetted Ripple Labs in violating securities laws with respect to the crypto company’s offers and sales of XRP. However, he stated that any action would only be restricted to the programmatic sales and other distributions since the dismissal with respect to the institutional sales was with prejudice, meaning a claim cannot be brought again regarding that particular matter. In July, Judge Torres also ruled that the institutional sales were investment contracts, which amounted to them being securities. In line with this, the SEC and Ripple will move to settle on the latter’s violation of securities laws, with the firm expected to pay a particular amount as a fine for its violation of the act. Token price clears $0.54 resistance | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com Will The SEC Appeal Judge’s XRP Decision? As to whether the SEC will appeal Judge Torres’ ruling on the programmatic sales and other distributions, Rispoli seemed to suggest that that was unlikely as the SEC was more focused on crunching the numbers (probably the monies Ripple will pay as fine) and “wrap this one up for good.” In a subsequent post, he also mentioned that there was the possibility that they received assurances from the SEC to not file an appeal as one would expect that Garlinghouse and Larsen’s “high-powered attorneys” would have asked that the SEC dismissed all the claims, including the ones relating to the programmatic sales and other distributions. Related Reading: Bitcoin: On-Chain Tracker Points Out Interesting Difference Between Current And Past Rallies Interestingly, Rispoli had once predicted the likely outcome of this case as he had stated that the SEC was unlikely to drag Ripple’s executives through a trial and that they had only brought forward the claims against them in order to force Ripple into a “weak settlement position.” The SEC is also unlikely to appeal, going by pro-XRP legal expert John Deaton’s comments when he suggested that the ETH Gate saga may have forced the SEC into what Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty has described as a “surrender.” Featured image from U.Today, chart from Tradingview.com",NEUTRAL,ETH | XRP,BTC | ETH | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/pro-xrp-expert-sec-ripple/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

The difference, represented by funding rates (that is, the cost of holding long/short positions in perpetual futures, also called perp premium), has surged above an annualized 10% across major exchanges, including Binance, according to Velo Data. Positive funding rates mean buyers, or longs, pay shorts to keep their leveraged bullish bets open.  Traders can then set up a so-called funding fee arbitrage by selling perpetual futures while simultaneously buying the cryptocurrency in the spot market. That allows them to safely pocket the 10% in funding while bypassing the risk from a continued price rally.  ""This is an excellent market for arbitrage opportunities where (nearly) risk-free returns of 10-20% can be achieved,"" crypto services provider Matrixport's research and strategy head Markus Thielen said. ""BTC's annualized perp premium was 40% yesterday. It has pulled back to 13% today, but still good enough for arbitrage trades.""

This development has been closely watched by the cryptocurrency community, who have observed a notable degree of volatility in XRP’s price dynamics in recent times. The cryptocurrency’s ability to surmount these substantial resistance barriers signals a possible shift in market dynamics and has generated considerable interest among traders and investors. Related Reading: Dogecoin Aggressive 12% Leap: Fear/Greed Index Uncovers Bullish Sentiment Secrets XRP’s Legal Victory Sets The Stage For A Promising Future Ripple’s native token, XRP, has emerged as a standout performer in the cryptocurrency space following a significant legal victory against the US Securities and Exchange Commission in mid-July. At that pivotal moment, a federal judge ruled that Ripple’s structured XRP sales did not fall under the classification of investment contracts. Since this ruling effectively established that XRP’s status as a digital asset was distinct from being deemed a security, it delivered a much-needed boost of confidence to the cryptocurrency and blockchain communities. It was a watershed moment for Ripple and its digital currency, highlighting the company’s potential for growth inside the industry’s shifting legal structure. The verdict in this case has rekindled hope and set XRP’s future on a promising course. At the time of writing, XRP was trading at $0.55, up 1.6% in the last 24 hours and registering a decent 13% increase in the last seven days, data from crypto market tracker Coingecko shows. XRP seven-day price action. Source: Coingecko In the context of the cryptocurrency market, where trends can change rapidly, the observation that XRP has not only crossed but exceeded both the 200-day and 50-day Exponential Moving Averages carries considerable weight. EMAs are widely recognized as crucial technical tools, serving as essential guides for traders and analysts to evaluate an asset’s price movement over specific timescales. Related Reading: Solana Barrels Close To $32: Critical Levels Traders Should Watch XRP market cap currently at $29.414 billion. Chart: TradingView.com XRP’s Price Action And Key Resistance When XRP’s price action consistently rises above these key EMAs, it is taken as a bullish sign that the cryptocurrency may be headed for new highs. Given the current climate of the cryptocurrency market, where rising prices tend to coincide with rising confidence and investor interest, this event takes on greater significance. The altcoin has exhibited a commendable weekly performance, thereby approaching a critical level of $0.56. This particular price point has consistently served as a resistance level since the middle of August. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates a prolonged bullish trend as it remains above the neutral line at 50.0. This suggests the possibility of a breakthrough at the price level of $0.54, maybe resulting in an upward movement of the XRP price towards $0.60. Meanwhile, the euphoric feeling surrounding Bitcoin’s ascent to $35,000, which frequently serves as a benchmark for the rest of the crypto market, can be partially ascribed to the present momentum being enjoyed by XRP. Is this the commencement of a larger narrative?

They are popular investment products as they are cheap to trade and allow investors to gain access to cryptocurrencies without buying the underlying digital assets themselves. Many analysts and trading houses expect spot bitcoin ETF approval to lead to a rush of mainstream money into the sector.  Matrixport notes there are about 420 million- 440 million cryptocurrency owners globally. 260 million are in Asia, 54 million in North America, 38 million in Africa, 31 million in South America and 1.5 million in Oceania. While Asia is the largest group by far, the “buying power of U.S. traders and institutions is a magnitude larger,” the report said.  The total crypto market cap has climbed back above $1.25 trillion, the note said.  There has been a 99% increase in volume, with $92 billion traded across the market, the note added. Bitcoin is still the top cryptocurrency, with 53% dominance, and is leading even the most high-beta altcoins in terms of performance, Matrixport said.

19348946,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=557412,1698217555,Galaxy Foresees Stellar 74% Bitcoin Price Surge In Post-ETF Debut Year,"Galaxy Digital, a leading player in the digital assets sphere, has issued a bullish prediction for Bitcoin’s trajectory following the launch of the much-anticipated US-regulated spot Bitcoin ETF. According to a recent study published by the firm on October 24, the introduction of the ETF is set to considerably bolster Bitcoin’s adoption, positioning it more firmly as a recognized asset class. Advantages Of An ETF Galaxy’s analysis highlights that a spot Bitcoin ETF would be “one of the most impactful catalysts for the adoption of Bitcoin (and crypto as an asset class).” By the end of September, Bitcoin assets held across diverse investment products like ETPs and closed-end funds touched an impressive figure of 842,000 BTC, valuing approximately $21.7 billion. Galaxy Digital’s study also sheds light on the challenges faced by these investment avenues, pointing to factors like high fees, tracking errors, limited liquidity, and a somewhat constrained reach amongst broader investor groups. The introduction of the spot Bitcoin ETF, the report suggests, is poised to change this scenario dramatically. Related Reading: From $35,000 To $500,000? The Bitcoin Rollercoaster This Expert Sees Ahead Spot Bitcoin ETFs offer a multitude of benefits over the current structures: an improved fee system, greater liquidity, better price tracking, and a much-needed break from the complications of self-custodying assets. As the report explicitly states, “The presence of a US-regulated spot Bitcoin ETF that adheres to strict regulatory compliance not only provides a more secure platform but also elevates its transparency, making it a preferable choice over existing investment products.” Why A Spot Bitcoin ETF Matters Galaxy believes that the introduction of a Bitcoin ETF would increase the digital asset’s “accessibility across wealth segments” and establish “greater acceptance through formal recognition by regulators and trusted financial services brands.” The report highlights the disparity between age groups when it comes to Bitcoin investments. It reveals that while Boomers and older generations hold 62% of US wealth, only 8% of adults aged 50 and above have invested in cryptocurrency. Related Reading: MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Portfolio Soars Past $5 Billion As BTC Holds Firm At $34,000 Galaxy sees regulatory approval for a Bitcoin ETF as a significant step towards establishing Bitcoin as a mainstream investment. An ETF could help reduce market volatility by offering “greater price transparency and discovery for market participants.” Estimating Inflows From ETF Approval Galaxy’s forecast suggests the US wealth management sector, managing a combined asset worth $48.3 trillion, will be the most impacted by a Bitcoin ETF’s launch. They estimate potential inflows into the Bitcoin ETF to be around $14 billion in the first year, escalating to $27 billion in the second year and reaching $39 billion by the third year. Factoring in the historical relationship between gold ETF fund flows and gold price change, Galaxy predicts a potential price increase of 6.2% for BTC in the first month after an ETF’s launch. They project this to taper down to +3.7% by the last month of the first year, resulting in an estimated +74% increase in BTC in the first year of an ETF approval. At the current price, this would mean that BTC could rise above $59,000 in the post-ETF debut year. The Bigger Picture Beyond the potential inflows into a US ETF product, Galaxy predicts that there will be a much larger impact on BTC demand “from second-order effects”. The potential approval of a spot ETF in the US might instigate similar products in other global markets. Moreover, Galaxy expects that various other investment vehicles, like mutual funds and private funds, will integrate Bitcoin into their strategies. Galaxy suggests the potential for Bitcoin’s Total Addressable Market (TAM) to grow substantially, perhaps encroaching on traditional asset sectors like real estate and precious metals. The estimated potential new inflows into BTC could range between $125 billion to $450 billion “over an extended period.” Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/galaxy-74-bitcoin-price-surge-post-etf-debut-year/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/19348946.jpeg

An ETF could be a better investment vehicle for investors compared to currently offered products, such as trusts and futures, which hold over $21 billion in value, the fund said. The inflows could ramp up by $27 billion by the second year and $39 billion by the third year, it added.  “The U.S. wealth management industry will likely be the most addressable and direct market that would have the most net new accessibility from an approved Bitcoin ETF,” the note read. “As of October 2023, assets managed by broker-dealers ($27 trillion), banks ($11 trillion) and RIAs ($9 trillion) collectively totaled $48.3 trillion.”  Bitcoin spot ETF products could enable investors to obtain bitcoin exposure through a highly regulated list of partners, mainly traditional funds and banks with a history of strong customer protection and investment offerings.  And the demand is arguably outsized: A rumor last week sent bitcoin prices rocketing 10% within hours, while the discovery of the ticker BlackRock’s (BLK) proposed bitcoin ETF caused gains of 12% on Monday.  As such, Galaxy said the inflows could aid a 74% jump in bitcoin prices in the first year, considering liquidity and price impact of billions of dollars in investments.  Current products lacking  Galaxy said current investment products come with significant drawbacks for investors – such as high fees, low liquidity, and tracking error, these products are inaccessible to a wide investor population representing a significant portion of wealth.  A spot ETF, however, could be suited for any investor who wants direct exposure to bitcoin without having to own and manage the bitcoin through self-custody.  “Greater efficiencies through fees, liquidity, and price tracking,” the note said. “While fees haven’t been listed by bitcoin ETF applicants yet, ETFs generally offer lower fees compared to hedge funds or closed-end funds, and the high number of ETF applicants will likely aim to keep fees low to remain competitive.”  There are currently 12 spo bitcoin ETFs in consideration by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

42392233,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg36pD,1698214857,Trader Who Called Last Year's Crypto Crash Covers Bearish Altcoin Bets,"Pseudonymous Trader il Capo Of Crypto, known for predicting last year’s market crash, has squared off loss-making bearish bets in alternative cryptocurrencies.  Capo has flipped from bearish to neutral, with bitcoin topping key resistance at $31,000.  Capo's primary bearish case of bitcoin sliding to $12,000 is not yet fully invalidated.  Well-known cryptocurrency trader il Capo Of Crypto has covered bearish bets against several alternative cryptocurrencies as bitcoin (BTC) rallied to $35,000 for the first time since May 2022.  “This breakout is not good for the main bearish scenario. I didn’t expect the $31K resistance level to break that easily,” Capo said in a Telegram broadcast to his 614,675 subscribers. “I’m out of my shorts that were in a loss (AAVE, SOL, CRO and TRX) [and] keeping the ones in profit (BNB, MATIC and WAVES) open until more information is available.”  Capo, who has been trading digital assets since 2017 and stocks for over six years, predicted last year’s crypto carnage. Capo retained his bearish outlook in June, calling a bitcoin slide to $12,000 and ether to $500-$700 even though, by then, BTC was up 50% for the year.  ""There were (and are) a lot of reasons to be bearish. Every time I checked the charts, I saw that, and that's what I communicated to my followers,"" Capo told CoinDesk.  The persistent bearish bias drew the ire of the crypto community on social media platform X, with some now looking at Capo’s latest decision to close bearish bets as a contrary indicator.  ""Capo capitulating. Hope you enjoyed the pump, It is over,” one user said on X, while another said it's a “top signal.""  Per Capo, the primary bearish scenario of BTC falling to $12,000 is not fully invalidated yet but has become less likely with prices above $31,000.  In other words, two scenarios look plausible. Bitcoin may revisit the former resistance-turned-support at $31,000 before posting a more substantial rally or drop below the said level, confirming a ""fake breakout"" and restoring the bearish bias.  ""No, I am not bullish, just neutral. I'm not buying yet nor closing the shorts that are in profit, just the losing positions to derisk a bit. If the price goes back below the support zone, I will start adding shorts again,"" Capo told CoinDesk. ""the macro looks very bad, with a recession being likely, two big wars... and Binance could face big problems, that's why I'm still big short BNB.""  The macro factors, however, have recently fallen to the back burner, thanks to the spot bitcoin ETF narrative.

This substantial rally allowed the cryptocurrency to surpass a significant resistance level positioned at $0.0640. Notably, this price breakthrough represented a momentous achievement for Dogecoin, as it hadn’t reached such heights since August 31. The cryptocurrency’s remarkable rebound from a low of $0.06068 indicated a resurgence in investor interest and enthusiasm, underlining the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. This event also served as a reminder of Dogecoin’s ability to capture the attention of traders and investors, prompting them to join the fray during this period of heightened market activity. Related Reading: Solana Barrels Close To $32: Critical Levels Traders Should Watch Dogecoin: Market’s Shift Toward ‘Greed’ Territory In a recent X post by @DogecoinFear, an intriguing insight into the Dogecoin Fear and Greed Index emerges, revealing a current score of 71, which signals that the market may be entering “greed” territory. Dogecoin Fear and Greed Index is 71. Greed pic.twitter.com/TEgVW6MunR — Doge Fear and Greed Index (@DogecoinFear) October 24, 2023 In this context, “greed” signifies an intense desire for profit. A high score on the Dogecoin Fear and Greed Index, like the 71 mentioned, reflects a market where many investors are primarily motivated by the pursuit of substantial financial gains. This heightened “greed” sentiment can raise concerns about potential overvaluation or a forthcoming market correction. This fascinating metric holds significance for cryptocurrency enthusiasts, as it suggests the potential for an impending market correction. Conversely, when the index dips into “Fear” territory, it may serve as an indicator for investors to consider it a buying opportunity. At the time of writing, DOGE was trading at $0.066, down 2.8% in the last 24 hours, but still maintained a solid 12% ascent in the last seven days, data from crypto market tracker Coingecko shows. DOGE market cap currently at $9.3 billion. Chart: TradingView.com A number of cryptocurrency analysts have recently said in X posts that they believe DOGE will eventually reach the lofty $1 target. Dogecoin, according to cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez over the weekend, is nearing the peak of a multiyear slipping triangle pattern. This pattern often serves as a technical indicator that hints at a potential bullish breakout. The $1 target for DOGE has been a subject of widespread interest and speculation within the cryptocurrency community, and these insights from analysts reinforce the optimism surrounding Dogecoin’s future price trajectory. Related Reading: XRP 10% Rally Strengthens Case For $0.55 Breakout DOGE’s Bullish Signal: TD Sequential Indicator in Action Based on Martinez’s analysis, it has been seen that the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential indicator has recently exhibited a bullish signal for DOGE.

The TD Sequential presented a buy signal on DOGE weekly chart.” He added that a sustained close above the key resistance level at $0.062 holds the potential to trigger a notable upswing in Dogecoin’s value, potentially driving it towards the $0.070 mark. This pivotal breakthrough could signify a shift in market sentiment, attracting more traders and investors who see the potential for further gains. It’s an important technical milestone to watch, as surpassing such resistance levels often signals renewed interest and buying activity in the cryptocurrency market.

42392218,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg35Q1,1698211265,Coinbase Says SEC Is Attempting to ‘Redefine Definition of an Investment Contract’,"Coinbase (COIN) has filed a response to the Securities and Exchange (SEC) to get an enforcement action against the exchange dismissed, arguing that the tokens don’t necessarily represent the definition of an investment contract.  The SEC is attempting to expand its regulatory scope in a way not authorized by Congress, Coinbase argued, taking an approach that was expected by insiders.  The SEC first sued Coinbase, along with Binance, in early June. Coinbase moved to dismiss the suit in August, with the exchange’s Chief Legal Officer telling CoinDesk at the time that they hoped U.S. regulators would be forced to “establish clear rules of the road that everyone could understand and follow.”  “As the SEC now would have it, an investment contract exists if someone parts with capital [and] expecting that her purchase will increase in value,” Coinbase argued in the filing. “The SEC proposes this departure from precedent in the service of a radical expansion of its own authority. It claims authority over essentially all investment activity—and thus the right to define its own regulatory ambit, constrained only by its own ambition.”  Coinbase argues that assets like paintings, baseball cards, and cryptocurrencies can be investments but aren’t securities unless they offer a contractual claim related to a business’ future profits or assets, and the SEC hasn’t shown that trades on Coinbase’s platform confer such claims or a financial stake in an enterprise.  “Were the SEC’s position accepted, countless software-driven services would be securities. That would be another radical expansion of SEC authority with no grounding in precedent,” the exchange wrote in its filing.  The SEC faces judicial challenges in its crypto industry lawsuits, with significant rulings undermining its stance that most cryptocurrencies are securities.  There’s some momentum questioning whether the “major questions doctrine” applies in preventing the SEC from regulating the evolving crypto legislative space, CoinDesk previously reported.  In the filing, Coinbase argued that the SEC’s approach oversteps its bounds and raises significant separation-of-powers concerns, especially when enforcement actions are taken without clear regulatory guidance.  “The separation-of-powers concerns animating that question are at their most acute when an agency wields enforcement power without regulatory process, under the guise of enforcing a Congressional mandate,” Coinbase wrote.  A decision on this case might come in early 2024.  This isn’t Coinbase’s only battle with the SEC in court. In April, the exchange sued the regulator to force it to create clarity on crypto rules.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/25/coinbase-says-sec-is-attempting-to-redefine-definition-of-an-investment-contract,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bf83f8fdb72c3ca9995dbc10cd838d2e6d0f3948-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The ProShares Short BTC Strategy ETF, designed for traders banking on a decline in Bitcoin futures, grappled with a record low. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mania: EY Insider Reveals Demand From Wall Street Titans, $40,000 Soon? Just over a year ago, this fund basked in the glory of a peak value of $45.61; a zenith reached as crypto assets took a downturn in the aftermath of FTX’s collapse. However, this year, the ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF has faced challenges, its value diminishing by 59.3% to stand at $16.68, a historic nadir, at the time of writing. This dip didn’t deter investors. Despite the drop, the ProShares Short BTC ETF, boasting net assets of $62.98 million, is poised for its second consecutive month of inflows, according to data from Lipper. Lucas Kiely, the Chief Investment Officer at digital wealth platform Yield App, offered a perspective on this trend. He posited that the market might be “buying the rumor and selling the fact.” Kiely further elaborated that the BTC short ETF provides investors a unique opportunity to speculate on a potential BTC sell-off. The Chief Investment Officer noted: A lot of people think this rally is a short squeeze – we have no real news coming out and a lot of anticipation around the SEC’s approval or disapproval of these spot ETFs and people are getting ahead of themselves. Ultimately, the market is again buying the rumor and selling the fact and the BTC short ETF is the only way for investors to express the view BTC is going to sell off. Furthermore, Kiely suggested another motive behind investors’ moves. With the surge in BTC’s value, some might be seeking to “lock in” their profits and, hence, are turning to the ETF as a hedge against potential future downturns. Other BTC-Related ETFs Enjoy The Rise Conversely, some BTC-associated ETFs rode the wave of optimism. The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, mirroring BTC futures alongside the Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF, registered gains of 7.68% and 6.54%, respectively, over the past day. Leading the pack among recently introduced funds that track Ethereum (ETH )futures was the Valkyrie Bitcoin and Ether Strategy ETF, with a commendable 7.64% uptick over the same period.

By selling at spot rates, the fund has netted $1.28 million in profits since the stETH was bought at an average price of $1,550 less than a week ago. 1inch Investment Fund Sells stETH StETH, or staked Ethereum (ETH), is an ERC-20 token representing staked ETH on the Lido Finance protocol. The platform allows anyone to stake their coins and earn rewards without necessarily locking their coins for an extended period. Related Reading: All Clear For $40,000? Bitcoin Shows Little On-Chain Resistance Ahead As of October 24, Lido Finance is the most popular decentralized finance (DeFi) application looking at total value locked (TVL). DeFiLlama data shows that the protocol manages over $15.7 billion of assets, of which over 95% are ETH. Technically, any ETH holder wishing to stake and earn network rewards stake on Lido Finance receives stETH in return, representing the stake amount. The higher the staked amount, the more stETH the protocol issued. This stETH can be traded, transferred, or used to secure loans while concurrently earning network rewards. Selling stETH means 1inch Investment Fund automatically unstaked the same amount on Lido Finance and sold the underlying coins. Even so, transferring the underlying ETH can take several days when there might be changes to spot prices. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) Surge Far From Done As Crypto Analyst Predicts Rise To $15 Curiously, the decision is when the crypto market seems to recover, and Ethereum is roaring back to life towards the $2,000 level. Considering that the fund is private and doesn’t divulge its strategy to the public, it couldn’t be immediately determined why it sells stETH when market confidence is high. Will Ethereum Prices Break $2,000? Looking at price charts, Ethereum prices are up roughly 17% from H2 2023 lows, rallying at spot rates. The October 23 and 24 expansion has seen the coin break higher, registering new October highs. Even so, despite the overall confidence, the failure of bulls to complete reverse losses of August 17 should be a concern. Ideally, a comprehensive surge above $1,800 and $2,000 could anchor a leg up toward $2,100 in the coming sessions. When the fund sold stETH at $1,823, price data showed it exited at around today’s peak.

The Bitcoin Rollercoaster This Expert Sees Ahead","Stephan Livera, an esteemed host of his namesake podcast and Swan Bitcoin’s Head of Education, has now provided the crypto community with projections for Bitcoin’s future trajectory. This week, Bitcoin experienced a rally that took its price to as high as $35,000, marking its highest point since May 2022. However, amid the favorable climate around a potential spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval and institutional adoption, Livera posits that this surge is merely the precursor to a much grander bull run. Related Reading: Bitcoin Path To $70,000? Analyst Shows What This ‘Head And Shoulders’ Pattern Reveals The Potential Impetus: A Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF could be a game-changer for Bitcoin’s valuation, according to Livera. Conversing with Michelle Makori, the Lead Anchor and Editor-in-Chief at Kitco News, during the Pacific Bitcoin Festival, Livera emphasized the possible ripple effects of such an approval. While murmurs suggest that ETF approval might be on the horizon by the close of this year, Livera diverges from this sentiment. Livera anticipates this landmark event to materialize more likely in 2024. The Head of Education at Swan Bitcoin noted: Although many experts predict that [a spot Bitcoin ETF] will come in three to six months, I don’t believe it will happen this year. Next year is the more likely scenario … in the first or second quarter of 2024, which would coincide with the halving cycle, which is expected in April. Notably, a significant event, such as the halving cycle, will impact Bitcoin’s market dynamics. Historically, this event – which slices the miners’ reward for new block addition to the Bitcoin blockchain by half – has spurred price shifts. The upcoming cycle will set the block reward at 3.125 BTC. This, combined with the potential spot ETF approval, could catalyze a heightened interest and influx of investments into Bitcoin, according to Livera. Projected Peaks And Troughs: The BTC Landscape Livera offers a roadmap of Bitcoin’s possible pricing journey. The Swan Bitcoin’s Head of Education foresees a stabilization around the $30,000 mark shortly, with a potential escalation toward $40,000 as we approach next year’s halving event. But the real fireworks might commence after the halving, ushering in a wild bull run. Expounding on historical trends, Livera shared: Historically, what we’ve seen around the halving is a bit of a rise into the halving, then a bit of a selloff after. Six to 12 months out, that’s when the real crazy bull run happens, and you get 10x or 20x in the Bitcoin price at that point. This extrapolation by Livera culminates in a noteworthy prediction for the end of 2024 – a bold ascent, perhaps reaching roughly $500,000 by 2025 or early 2026, according to the expert. Related Reading: Will October Be Bitcoin’s Golden Month Again? A Dive Into A Decade Of Bullish Trends However, the climb might be coupled with a steep decline. Drawing parallels to gold, Livera posits Bitcoin could potentially mimic its valuation range. Livera added, emphasizing the volatility of the crypto domain: It’s quite possible that Bitcoin comes close to the range of gold, and that would imply a price in the $500k range. As is a tradition in this industry, we’ll probably hit that as a blow-off top, followed by a drop of 80%. So, it might go to $500k and then crash to $100k.

As a result of this uptrend, PEPE has reclaimed its position in the top 100 list of cryptocurrencies, currently ranking 96th. Bitcoin’s Surge Beyond $35,000 Sparks Market Uptrend This surge in value has been largely influenced by the market leader, Bitcoin (BTC), which surpassed the $35,000 mark on Tuesday. For many, the current uptrend is driven by anticipation of the approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), which could potentially bring a new wave of capital into the market. Furthermore, Dogecoin is among the five popular meme coins influenced by Bitcoin’s rise to $35,000. Shiba Inu also experienced a 5.9% gain and is currently trading at $0.00000765, following a similar pattern to DOGE.

In a significant development, the dev team behind PEPE announced on X (formerly Twitter) that approximately 6.9 trillion $PEPE tokens, worth around $6,000,000, have been burned. Additionally, a new team of advisors has been brought on board to guide the future direction of Pepe. The original team is exploring using the remaining 3.79 trillion tokens, attributed to the Centralized Exchange (CEX) multi-sig wallet, for strategic partnerships and marketing opportunities. The PEPE community can expect regular updates on future token burns, movements, or uses through Twitter and the official telegram channel. PEPE Price Skyrockets By 25.83% In 24 Hours As of today, the price of Pepe (PEPE) stands at US$0.000000930549, with a 24-hour trading volume of $455,035,042.79. This represents a significant price increase of 25.83% in the last 24 hours and a 43.63% increase over the past 7 days. With a circulating supply of 420 billion PEPE, Pepe currently holds a market capitalization of $398,014,904. On the other hand, SHIB is currently priced at $0.00000739, with a 24-hour trading volume of $314,695,140.13. Over the past 24 hours, SHIB has experienced a price increase of 2.72% and a 6.04% increase over the past 7 days. With a circulating supply of 590 billion SHIB, Shiba Inu has a market capitalization of US$4,348,847,496.

19337743,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=557359,1698195646,66% Of Top Smart Contracts On Base Have One Big Problem,"14/21, or 66%, of the top gas-consuming smart contracts on Base, a layer-2 platform for building and deploying smart contracts, are unverified. According to Token Terminal data on October 24, the same contracts are some of the most actively used, reading from gas fee trends over the last month. Friend.tech Leads The Gas Race On Base Base is a layer-2 scaling solution and one of OP Mainnet and Arbitrum’s competitors. The platform relies on the Optimistic Rollup technique, allowing transactions to be batched off-chain before being confirmed on the mainnet. This is the same approach competitors, including Arbitrum and OP Mainnet, adopted. As of October 24, the most gas-consuming protocol already labeled and known to be deployed from a given developer is Friend.tech. Still, the developer remains anonymous. The decentralized social media protocol allows users to buy and sell keys to each other’s X accounts. In this way, trading parties can access exclusive in-app chatrooms and content by a given user. By deploying on Base, Friend.tech users enjoy lower trading fees than they would have launched on the mainnet. Beyond fees, the protocol can also scale since the layer-2 solution can handle higher throughput than the mainnet. Related Reading: Economist Peter Schiff Raises Concerns About Spot Bitcoin ETFs In the last month, Friend.tech generated over $253,000 in gas fees. The execution fee, often known as layer-2 fee, on Base, which uses Optimism, is set by the network and is flat. The fee prevents users from spamming the network and rewards nodes that prove all transactions submitted on the platform. The other fee is the approximate for confirming the same transaction batch on the mainnet. This fee is generally higher than the execution fee. The Case Of Popular But Unverified Smart Contracts While gas fees generated by Friend.tech is over $253,000, it is down over 47% in the last month. This could suggest that trading activity fell since the fee generated by a network is directly proportional to how frequently it is used. Friend.tech fees, when writing, remain suppressed, underperforming the activity of unverified smart contracts, looking at fees generated over the last month. Over the previous 30 days, one unverified contract has seen a 104% increase in trading fees, reaching $42,000. Another contract has increased by 1,690%, exceeding $11,000 in the same period. Related Reading: Ethereum End Of Month Challenge: Can ETH Reach $2,000 Amid $21 Billion DeFi TVL? As the name suggests, these unverified codes have yet to be confirmed by a third party. This can mean there is no guarantee that the same developer built and deployed code on Base. At the same time, the code might contain malicious code that could steal from addresses it interacts with.

19335899,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=557332,1698192001,Bitcoin Spot ETF Approval: Why Price Could Be Set For 300% Surge,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) price could be set to experience a 300% surge if a Spot Bitcoin ETF is finally approved by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). BTC Could Surge 300% When A Spot ETF Is Approved The predictions of Bitcoin experiencing a 300% surge in its price from analysts can be traced back to the growth of Gold over the years after a Spot Gold ETF (SPDR Gold Shares) was approved back in November 2004, and listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Related Reading: This Shibarium Milestone Could Rocket Shiba Inu To August Highs The price of Gold had experienced an eight-year consecutive bull run following its first spot gold ETF. Before the listing, the price of Gold as of November 2004, was around $430/oz, and 3 years later, the numbers had doubled. Fast-forward to the end of 2011, the price of gold was already trading at $1,800/oz indicating a 300% surge in price. Currently, the price of gold is closely gaining on its highest peak price of $1,977/oz, bolstered by geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Gold moves slowly and steadily, and it is significantly less volatile than Bitcoin, but analysts anticipate the price of Bitcoin is likely to reach $120,000 in the next couple of years if the digital asset manages to reiterate the movement of Gold since its spot gold ETF approval. If the Bitcoin price were to follow this same pattern, then it could hit $100,000. Recently, Bitcoin has achieved its highest price peak of $35,000 since May 2022. The recent increase in price can be traced back to the propaganda and excitement encompassing a spot Bitcoin ETF approval. However, the digital asset is still 50% down from its all-time high in 2021. Last week, Bitcoin experienced a whirlwind rise of over 10% within minutes after a false report was released by Cointelegraph that a spot Bitcoin ETF had been approved by the SEC. However, the digital asset’s price later fell almost immediately after the report was proven to be false by Blackrock’s Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink. Its significant market movement this week has prompted analysts to enter “price prediction mode.” The breakout was anticipated by cryptocurrency expert Mags for the end of the year. In addition, a decline below $30,000 is anticipated within the following few months. Analysts believe that this will be the last area of accumulation before a significant breakout that would see the asset rise up to $50,000 prior to the halving. BTC price corrects downward | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Bitcoin Spot ETF Boasts Higher Chance Of Approval Recently, analysts have predicted a spot Bitcoin ETF to be approved by January 2024, due to the recent developments following the approval of a Spot Bitcoin ETF by the SEC.

The team’s prediction came amidst ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF filling that had been updated with 5 new pages.
