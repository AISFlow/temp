42378650,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7kwvZ,1457209274,Can Trust-Based Private Blockchains Be Trusted?,"Bob Wolinsky is senior managing director of Genesis Project, where he leads a blockchain research and technology company focused on the commercialization of private blockchains.  In this opinion piece, Wolinsky – and colleagues Jonathan Wolinsky and Paul Sztorc – take aim at prevailing permissioned blockchain designs and what they argue is their inability to deliver immutable recordkeeping.  Today, the blockchain technology sector is awash in salesmen selling every kind of workaround to the one thing they can't deliver to a private blockchain: the efficiency, bulletproof security and mathematical certainty of the proof-of-work protocol.  There's a growing trend that finds people believing that an equivalent alternative to proof-of-work efficiency exists, that traditional countermeasures can be employed to secure the fidelity of a private blockchain's historical record, or that 'regulated' or 'trusted' parties will not collude to alter the historical record simply because they are regulated.  Nothing can be further from the truth.  With the desire to commercialize blockchain technology, two schools of thought have emerged regarding mechanisms to secure the provenance of the historical record of a distributed-ledger blockchain system: (1) proof-of-work and rules, and (2) trust or permissioning and rules.  Many would argue that proof-of-stake and its derivatives are a third security mechanism. However, upon detailed inspection of the underlying mathematics and rules you will find that proof-of-stake is merely an exotic form of permissioning, so we lump it in with trust.  Our colleague Paul Sztorc has written extensively on the economics and security regarding proof-of-stake. Suffice it to say, proof-of-stake is less efficient, untested and potentially less secure than proof-of-work.  Others talk about blockchain node 'round robins', 'token rings' and the like. However, these mechanisms ultimately rely on trust as well.  Does trust work?  Many have used very colorful arguments in support of trust-based blockchain systems including rationales that 'rules' govern the interactions of the parties, and in certain FinTech situations, the parties are government 'regulated' and, as such, guided by a higher authority.  For the sake of clarity, let us look at the quality of the regulated parties. Below, we culled from the media a small sampling of evidence covering the behavior of 'trusted' and 'regulated' parties (emphasis added).  Bloomberg, 24th July 2015:    ""Treasury Securities Dealers Accused of Collusion ... Bank of America Corp, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co are among 22 financial companies accused of colluding to manipulate auctions of U.S. Treasury securities ... $6bn in fines from banks in a similar investigation ...""    CBSNews, 20th June 2015:    ""In rare admission of guilt, Wall Street banks say they rigged markets ... Five of the world's largest banks have plead guilty to federal charges including manipulating the global foreign exchange market and rigging a benchmark interest rate that affects the cost of credit card ... agreed to pay more than $5bn ...""    Wall Street Journal, 12th September 2015:    ""Wall Street's biggest banks have agreed to a tentative settlement over allegations that they conspired torig the market for credit derivatives ... Twelve banks and two industry groups reached a preliminary agreement ... to pay $1.87bn ... this behavior by Wall Street could be more far-reaching than we thought ...""    In all situations described above, traditional countermeasures (lawsuits, fines, settlements, SEC investigations, and in some cases jail) are being used to address collusion amongst 'trusted' and 'regulated' parties.  So, what does 'trusted' mean in the context of blockchain technology? Does it simply mean you can rely on the party for anything?  No, not really. In blockchain parlance, 'trusted' means the party is being'trusted' to follow the rules of the blockchain.  This line of reasoning forms the basis to the perceived viability of all trust-based systems. As evidenced above, it is faulty.  Trust is so old-fashioned  Now that we've heard the fantasy, let's look at the reality.  Any rules created for a blockchain (ie: using a token ring, 'longest chain wins' ... any rule, it doesn't matter) can be broken by colluding parties. Why? Because there is factually nothing substantive, nothing other than faith, stopping colluding parties from disregarding the rules.  When collusion occurs amongst blockchain parties, they can rewrite their local records regardless of other parties' interests and protestations. Other parties may not even detect that colluders altered the historical record.  Even worse, since there is no way to prove which party has the correct record (ie: the objective state of the ledger), the system breaks with multiple objective states and multiple attendant claims to historical record authenticity, none of which are provable. Using dates to prove the correct objective state of the distributed ledger is both useless and immaterial – data can be backdated, after all, it's just ones and zeros that can be rewritten.  So, what happens if the parties choose not to follow the rules and fork the historical record of the blockchain? What mechanisms exist for aggrieved parties to respond to collusion, if detected?  Well, in the case of trust-based blockchain environments, not much other than old-fashioned traditional countermeasures – lawsuits, fines, settlements, SEC investigations and in some cases jail – all the inefficient stuff the pre-blockchain world used to enforce contracts.  It should be apparent that the need of reliance on traditional countermeasures to enforce blockchain rules defies the entire concept and implied efficiency of blockchain technology.  Proof-of-Work  In the case of proof-of-work, Satoshi expects the parties to cheat/collude, hence the now well-known 51% attack vector example. However, Satoshi introduces a cost equation to cheating/collusion via the proof-of-work protocol as a non-traditional countermeasure.  Proof-of-work in the context of a distributed ledger and the trustless environment it helps to generate is a massive paradigm shift that is foundationally new and revolutionary.  The cost is both predictable and big, and it does not require the imposition of traditional countermeasures on participants in order to enforce following the rules (just a simple equation for determining whether the rules have been followed, ie: longest chain/most work wins), hence the 'trustless' environment.  Notwithstanding so-called 'miner consolidation' arguments (which is a topic for another discussion), the 51% attack vector discussion is immensely relevant to understanding the genius of Satoshi's bitcoin innovation and successful blockchain technology derivatives.  In actuality, the 51% discussion describes a risk-assessment mechanism – precisely calculating the requisite proof-of-work hashing power cost to overturn the record.                  Proof-of-work makes the cost of overturning the record empirically quantifiable. Without proof-of-work, alternative means are subjective in nature and, as such, provide neither a practicable nor an empirical approach to quantify the fidelity of the historical record.  Consequently, the immutability of the historical record becomes a theoretical academic argument not a scientific or objective fact. This particular (non-theoretical) quantifiable risk capability makes proof-of-work very appealing from a transaction, tax and audit perspective and drives the interparty efficiency of blockchain technology in-toto.  Proof-of-work 'paradigm shift'  Let us digress for a moment to a prior argument in order to elucidate the immense paradigm shift that proof-of-work delivers in the form of a trustless environment.  Many would argue that cheating by, or collusion amongst, regulated parties is an illegal act with associated and significant deterrent costs which are sufficient to enforce the rules.  As evidenced above, we know this line of reasoning to be faulty.  The reason for this is because when practicably employed, traditional deterrents generate both a non-deterministic and dynamic environment whereby deterrent costs inevitably become cost/benefit estimations – that is, zero cost for successful evasions versus more money due at some future point in time for unsuccessful cheating.  Contrary to the traditional deterrents approach, proof-of-work is entirely deterministic, whereby parties know the cost of cheating and collusion and must decide to pay this cost upfront.  If efficiency is greatest when the countermeasures are most expensive and immediate, then proof-of-work in the context of a distributed ledger and the trustless environment it helps to generate is a massive paradigm shift that is foundationally new and revolutionary.  It should be apparent by now that trust-based systems are merely unsecure and non-empirical software 'workarounds' (if you can even call them that) to the provision of a real security work-product, proof-of- work. In addition, it should be equally apparent that the arguments in support of workarounds to proof-of-work arise, not from a wisdom that it is prudent to build a distributed ledger without proof-of-work, but rather they arise solely from the historical inability to attain proof-of-work in an economical way.  It should also be obvious from the discussion that the proof-of-work protocol is factually the underlying key to unlocking the huge paradigm shift and efficiency of distributed-ledger blockchain technology – no traditional deterrents and countermeasures required – there really is no other viable alternative.  Incorporating the proof-of-work protocol into private blockchain technology taps directly into the immense efficiency of the bitcoin blockchain paradigm shift. Without it, all you've built is an old-fashioned (and inefficient) distributed database.  There's a warning here for companies seeking to utilize blockchain technology: beware and become aware. Beware the software-workaround salesman selling 'eternal immutability'. Become aware of the underlying elegance of bitcoin – it's not the software that makes bitcoin so efficient, it's the economics.  As can be expected, when it comes to blockchain technology and historical record immutability, there really isn't a free lunch.

42378637,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7kwdx,1457198883,Bitcoin is Not the Root Cause of Ransomware,"Ransomware has been around for a while – turns out it's about 20 years older than bitcoin – but it's been in the news again recently because of a particularly upsetting case involving a Los Angeles Hospital.  Most types of ransomware software ""lock"" the files on a victim's computer by encrypting them with a key that the hackers withhold until a ransom payment is made. In the early days of these tools, payment was typically made with wire transfer, prepaid cards or by SMS and mobile payments.  Now payment is almost always demanded in bitcoin.  You might think that this is because bitcoin is an ""anonymous"" payment method, and that hackers love it because they don't have to worry about being identified and ultimately caught. That's not actually why bitcoin is a good fit. Prepaid cards are actually more anonymous because they can be mailed and then used or resold internationally with effectively no trace.  Bitcoin transactions, however, leave a trail of pseudonymous breadcrumbs on the blockchain, and if the hacker tries to cash out into local currency, she might accidentally put a name or an IP address to those pseudonyms and give herself away. Blockchain transactions can reveal the structure of organized ransomware crime rings, and individual hackers can be and have been caught and prosecuted.  No, bitcoin is particularly useful here because it's fast, reliable, and verifiable.  The hacker can simply watch the public blockchain to know if and when a victim has paid up; she can even make a unique payment address for each victim and automate the process of unlocking their files upon a confirmed bitcoin transaction to that unique address.  The truth is that criminals have, as usual, very strict design parameters for the tools they use because there's no tech-support, contract or legal recourse for a criminal whose tools fail to perform as they should.  Jumping to solutions  Criminals are using bitcoin in this case because it's a reliable system that just works. Ransomware hackers are rather like the proverbial rumrunners of prohibition: they like fast custom cars because almost everyone else is still driving a Model T.  As problematic and sad as these attacks are, it’s important to carefully understand what’s happening so that we don’t jump to ""solutions"" that wouldn't solve the problem and could even make us less secure over time.  Three ingredients make ransomware the problem it is, and these things are just as true whether the victim is your Aunt Alice or a hospital or police station:  Hackers gain unauthorized access to a computer with read/write permission over sensitive or valuable data  Hackers place malware on that computer to encrypt its files using strong cryptography and a key which only they control  Hackers use Bitcoin to receive payment in exchange for the key.  Cryptography and bitcoin are the ""sexy"" parts of that trifecta, and accordingly, they get most of the media attention.  The root problem though, is number one: unauthorized access.  Security and privacy  In the hospital context, for example, it's already a security and privacy disaster that random hackers in Russia can access, read, modify and delete all of your sensitive medical records.  Whether the hacker then encrypts the files, or demands a ransom is a secondary issue; the damage is already done. Failing to keep those records private and safe puts patients in danger of discrimination, personal blackmail, and, of course, poor or compromised care.  So, to be very, very clear, the problem of ransomware begins with bad security.  Everyone – and especially employees of vulnerable institutions – needs to take the security of sensitive records more seriously; we all need to better understand phishing emails and other social engineering tactics that can be used by hackers to gain access to sensitive information.  This is a problem that's been around as long as the Internet, and yet the solutions are actually fairly straightforward: use strong passwords, don’t share your passwords with anyone (even people sending you official-looking emails) and don’t open suspicious email attachments from senders you don’t know.  Additionally, of this three-part problem, both cryptography and cryptocurrencies have entirely legal and even essential applications that make us more secure.  The first part, unauthorized access caused by poor security, has no upside.  Looking for a scapegoat  If we’re looking for a way to stop these attacks we need to target weaknesses in our privacy infrastructure, not the tools that some may use to exploit those weaknesses.  We need to use https encryption by default; we need to understand and practice two-factor authentication; we need to talk about password managers and what makes a strong password; and we need to think about payment systems that don’t consistently hemorrhage our personal identifying information.  Ignoring this problem of unauthorized access and putting the blame on cryptography and cryptocurrencies will not stop ransomware. In fact, outlawing or compromising these tools will make ransomware significantly worse.  Such policies would discourage honest individuals from learning about and utilizing the very technology that could make them safe; while criminals in darker corners of the world, the sophisticated rumrunners with strict design standards, would continue to use these powerful tools for evil.

42378640,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7kwhj,1457139670,Coinbase CEO: Core Developers May Be Bitcoin's ‘Biggest Systemic Risk',"Brian Armstrong, CEO of bitcoin exchange service Coinbase, said Friday that he believes the Bitcoin Core team, the development team that oversees work on bitcoin's software, may be the biggest systemic risk for the bitcoin network.  The comments were issued as part of a new blog post published after Armstrong attended the Satoshi Roundtable, an invite-only bitcoin industry retreat held between 26th to 28th February.  Armstrong opened with his take on the bitcoin network scaling debate, which he framed as an unresolved dispute between Core developers and ""most bitcoin companies who want growth"".  Miners, the entities that process transactions on the network, he said, are caught in the middle of a debate that he painted as philosophical in nature.  He went on to write:  ""The conversations initially focused on various compromises that could be made to kick the can down the road on scalability. But as the conversations went on, I became less and less concerned about what short-term solution we pick because I realized we all had a much bigger problem: the systemic risk to bitcoin if Bitcoin Core was the only team working on bitcoin.""  From there, Armstrong details his concerns with the Core team. Some of them, he writes, ""show very poor communication skills"" or ""lack maturity”, which he argued has kept other developers away from bitcoin.  He also drew contention with what he characterized as a preference for ""perfect"" solutions over ""good enough"" ones.  ""If no perfect solution exists they seem OK with inaction, even if that puts bitcoin at risk,"" he wrote.  Lastly, Armstrong criticized the Core team’s overall position on scaling the bitcoin network, writing:  “They seem to have a strong belief that bitcoin will not be able to scale long term, and any block size increase is a slippery slope to a future that they are unwilling to allow.""  According to a list included on the Satoshi Roundtable website, the group of Core contributors present at the gathering included Matt Corallo, Luke Dashjr, Alex Morcos and Peter Todd.  'Worst-case scenario'  Armstrong used the blog post to highlight a scenario in which, following the upcoming halving of the bitcoin network subsidy – instead of producing 25 new bitcoins per block, only 12.5 bitcoins will be created.  Miner profitability will plunge, he argued, thereby driving some of them out of the network entirely.  ""The implication of this is that we could see a reduction of hashing power on the network at the July halving date. Perhaps in the range of 10–50% (I don’t have a good way to estimate this, if anyone does please post it),"" he said.  Acknowledging that the likelihood of this scenario is ""unclear"", but he argued that any risk merits taking action to forestall any serious network disruption.  ""But I also feel that there is no reason to risk it and it’s incredibly irresponsible to play things so close to the edge,"" he wrote. ""The network today, with 70% of blocks full, is already experiencing congestion issues and backlogs. Any reduction in hashing power will exacerbate the problem.""  In the context of this hypothetical scenario, Armstrong criticized Core’s push for Segregated Witness, a change to how signature data is stored in bitcoin transactions. He argued that it would essentially take too long for both Bitcoin Core and wallet service providers to draft new code to handle support for Segregated Witness.  In light of the risks, Armstrong wrote, such an approach would be ""irresponsible and dangerous"" in light of issues that some transactors have experienced trying to broadcast transactions to the bitcoin network.  According to some observers, such activity adversely affects Coinbase's business model, as users are unable to deposit or withdraw funds in a timely fashion, which in turn impacts the overall customer experience.  Push for Classic  Armstrong’s solution: an immediate network shift to Bitcoin Classic, a competing bitcoin implementation that supporters say would keep the network cheap and accessible by, in the short term, raising the maximum size of transaction blocks from 1 megabyte (MB) to 2 MB.  He wrote:  ""This is the most realistic short-term scaling solution that will buy us time. My belief is that we will either be doing this upgrade now (when there is sufficient lead time for everyone to prepare), or we will be doing it in the midst of an emergency down the road. It is not a matter of if, but when.""  Armstrong has voiced his support for the project in the past, and his company hosted a media conference call featuring developer Gavin Andresen after last month's Classic release. Armstrong was also the first bitcoin business executive to indicate support for Classic on the project’s GitHub page when it launched in January.  He reiterated past calls for competing teams working to develop bitcoin implementations, writing that Classic is ""simply is the best option to mitigate risk right now"".  Armstrong then pushed for the creation of a ""new team"" to guide development of bitcoin. He wrote that the preferred team would be one that is ""welcoming of new developers to the community, willing to make reasonable trade offs, and a team that will help the protocol continue to scale"".  He suggested that Coinbase would play a role in the creation of this new group.  ""In the future, we will need to create a new team to work on the bitcoin protocol and help bitcoin become a multi-party system to avoid the systemic risk of core being the only team working on the protocol,"" he wrote, adding:  ""I hope to have an update for you on that in the coming months.”  People yelling via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2016/03/05/coinbase-ceo-core-developers-may-be-bitcoins-biggest-systemic-risk,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/93e4baa0e6c1cce52da370f6b5cef6ab268306d4-1500x977.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
