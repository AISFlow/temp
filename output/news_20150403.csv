42378133,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7MDCl,1428092418,Why Heartland Payments is 'Crawling' Toward Bitcoin Integration,"When Heartland Payments e-commerce director Joe Wysocki looks to add a product or service to his company's portfolio, he looks for three factors – that it will help Heartland's merchants improve security, convert shoppers and obtain repeat business.  Bitcoin, Wysocki says, aligns with these principles.  In a new interview with CoinDesk, Wysocki discussed the strategy behind the fifth-largest US payments processor's recent referral deal with BitPay, and the forces that encouraged it to consider its first opportunity in the digital currency market.  Overall, Wysocki described the deal as one that would add another ""arrow"" to Heartland's ""quiver"" of payments options.  Wysocki said:  ""We engaged BitPay about a partnership so when our national sales reps are out talking to e-commerce merchants of all sizes who are expressing a need for one or more of these particular solutions, we have a bitcoin option in our arsenal.""  The partnership, announced on 10th March, followed a similar agreement between BitPay and Global Payments finalized last August.  Observe then act  Wysocki indicated that Heartland has been observing activities in the bitcoin space ""for quite some time"", and that some of its merchants have reported hearing requests from customers who wanted a bitcoin payment option.  ""As a result, we felt in Q4 of last year, it made sense to add a bitcoin acceptance capability to our arsenal of services, so we can direct them to a best of breed partner like Bitpay that can work with them on their integrations,"" Wysocki said.  Wysocki said that this approach is similar to how it has integrated other alternative payment methods in the past, using a strategy he described as ""crawl, walk and run"".  ""This is consistent with the way we handle a lot of services – based on market feedback, we will in some point potentially build from there. With a lot of these services, it's about monitoring and managing as they go forward,"" he added.  Cross-pollination  For now, Wysocki reported that Heartland will continue to work with its merchants to help them understand bitcoin.  ""Part of that approach over time is working to educate our merchants on the nuances of bitcoin and our partnership with BitPay, but realistically that's an education process we go through with a lot of alternative payment modalities,"" he said.  Wysocki noted that this education process is likely to take time, as will the ramp up in the ease of use of bitcoin from a merchant's perspective.  As an example, he cited PayPal as a payment method that followed a similar trajectory.  ""Traditionally, Paypal was a product where the merchants had to establish an account with PayPal and a processor like Heartland would convey the transactions direct to PayPal, and what that meant for the merchant was they had two endpoints that they needed to reconcile,"" he continued.  Wysocki said that Heartland is just on the cusp of introducing a solution for this issue, but suggested it as evidence of the slow development cycle he believes bitcoin has entered, one that could blossom over time.  ""That's just one example where we started with that crawl, walk [and] run approach,"" he concluded.  Disclaimer: CoinDesk founder Shakil Khan is an investor in BitPay.

42378124,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7MD2h,1428086246,Buttonwood SF Founder Petitions California's Proposed Bitcoin Bill,"The founder of Buttonwood SF has started an online petition against a California legislative proposal for regulating digital currencies.  Penned by Assemblyman Matt Dababneh, chairman of the state’s Banking and Finance Committee, the proposal aims to regulate virtual currency businesses under the state's Money Transmission Act.  In so doing, the bill, otherwise known as AB-1326, would prohibit virtual currency businesses from operating unless they are licensed by the Department of Business Oversight (DBO) or have received an exemption from the agency.  John Light, the founder of Buttonwood SF, told CoinDesk:  ""I started this petition when I realised that AB-1326 would cause my meetup to shut down, since the legislation, if passed, would criminalise the cryptocurrency trading that takes place at the meetup.""  As previously reported by CoinDesk, potential applicants would need to pay a non-refundable $5,000 fee to register; provide certain identifying information; and keep a certain amount of funds in “investment-grade permissible investments”.  ""It costs $5000 just to apply for the license, to say nothing of the actual cost of the license itself and related compliance costs, which would price out all but the richest entrepreneurs and businesses that seek its protection and effectively put all of the traders at my meetup out of business,"" Light explained.  Amassing support  At the time of press, the petition had acquired over 80 participants, some of whom shared their views on the legislative proposal.  Rob Mitchell, a signatory, commented:  ""Bitcoin is an important new technology that should not require an expensive licensing procedure to take part in. AB-1326 seems to be attacking a problem that doesn't exist, and could mean the next big Financial Tech company won't be coming from California.""  Nozomi Hayase, another commenter, said: ""I am signing because people have a right to innovate and build legitimate businesses without restrain.""

42378131,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7MDAF,1428073836,Federal Agents Arrest Bitcoin Gun Buyer in Sting Operation,"A man from Hyannis, Massachusetts has been charged and arrested after attempting to buy a $2,500 firearm from a darknet website using bitcoin.  According to US Attorney Carmen Ortiz's office, Justin Moreira was arrested after he picked up a package he believed contained a .380 caliber pistol and a silencer, sent by an undercover federal agent, from a local post office.  ""Federal agents monitoring the Post office box immediately arrested Moreira after he retrieved the package this morning,"" the 2nd April press release noted.  Moreira was charged with one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm.  It is believed that Moreira engaged the federal agent in a series of online messages during which he looked into purchases of various firearms.  Moreira, a felon convicted of possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute in 2013, now faces a maximum sentence of 10 years and a $250,000 fine.

42378142,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7MDKJ,1428057125,Bitcoin in the Headlines: Silk Road Strikes Comedic Gold,"Bitcoin in the Headlines is a weekly look at global bitcoin news, analysing media and its impact.  You'd be forgiven for mistaking the news of corrupt special agents for a high-budget Hollywood Blockbuster – the plot itself is box office gold.  News coverage on bitcoin exploded this week as mainstream outlets from all over the globe picked up on new allegations that were filed in the ongoing saga of online black market Silk Road.  This time, however, Ross Ulbricht wasn't the center of attention. Rather, former Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent Carl Mark Force IV and his colleague on the Baltimore-based Silk Road investigation, US Secret Service agent Shaun Bridges, took center stage for alleged corruption, extortion and a litany of apparent abuses of power.  Overall, the tale cast this week's news in a humorous light, though not every media outlet was ""in"" on the jokes. As illustrated by the reporting on next year's St Petersburg Bowl, bitcoin is still a subject best left to the pros.  Corruption in the ranks  It's safe to say that at long last, the Silk Road drama couldn't possibly get more interesting.  It certainly has the necessary twists and turns to attract an audience – the latest affidavit itself reads like a sophisticated cybercrime novel – and it was perhaps this element of entertainment that attracted the attention of journalists worldwide.  At the time of press, a quick Google news search with the terms ""DEA agent"" and ""bitcoin"" brought up more than 500 articles. As proof of its reach, everyone from The Huffington Post through to Arya News – a Persian news outlet – covered the story.  Of particular focus was the brazenness of the actions of the accessed.  Writing for Bloomberg View, Matt Levine, described the agents' naivety, saying:  ""There is no playbook for blackmailing a secretive criminal mastermind using unencrypted online messages in which you pretend to be a French maid. No one, not even Carl Mark Force IV, does that every day. So it's understandable that he might have forgotten to sign his message with a fake name that was (1) gender-appropriate and (2) not his actual real first name.""  Force is thought to have used the pseudonym 'French Maid' during part of his communication with Dread Pirate Roberts. Levine's sarcasm is understandable, given that we are talking about two supposedly competent agents, who would presumeably know how to cover their tracks.  Interestingly, Wired's Andy Greenberg , provided a more serious exposé, explaining that the suspicion of inside corruption existed at the time of Ulbricht's trial, as Joshua Dratel, his lawyer had repeatedly spoken about a DEA informant.  Greenberg also examined the wider ramifications of the discovery, placing significant emphasis on how they may affect Ulbricht's legal case. He said:  ""Ulbricht still faces murder-for-hire charges in Maryland as a result of that [Baltimore Silk Road] investigation, a case that could be tainted by the alleged, epic misconduct of these two investigators.""  Here, Greenberg is alluding to the allegations that Ulbricht asked Force, when he was operating under the 'Number 13' pseudonym to kill someone on his behalf.  Flagrant fouls  Elsewhere, media outlets were poking fun at the Bitcoin St Petersburg Bowl, which we learned will not take place with its 'bitcoin' branding in 2015 and 2016.  The event, sponsored by BitPay, was one of the more public facing for the bitcoin community, but despite the audience the event attracted, it doesn't seem to have conveyed that bitcoin is, in fact, not a company.  In a piece for Yahoo Sports, Nick Bromberg makes a somewhat questionable attempt at defining the digital currency. Bitcoin, he says, is ""a peer-to-peer online currency system without a central authority. Because of it's structure, it's come under scrutiny, especially for its security"".  Massive generalizations aside, it is possible to overlook Bromberg's mistake, at least in context of other more flagrant fouls.  Tom Fornelli, a college football writer, had his say in CBSSports, noting:  ""ESPN.com's Brett McMurphy reported on Wednesday night that Bitcoin was dropping out of its sponsorship deal with the bowl in St. Petersburg, Florida after only one year.""  Here, Fornelli made a journalistic faux pas, misreporting that it was 'bitcoin' that had dropped out of the sponsorship deal, not BitPay.  However, he concluded on a nostalgic note we might be able to all agree on, writing:  ""You were gone too soon, Bitcoin Bowl, but you shall never be forgotten.""
