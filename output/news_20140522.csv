42377267,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7078F,1400795421,Price of Ripple Plummets as Co-Founder Plans 9 Billion XRP Selloff,"Ripple Labs co-founder Jed McCaleb has announced his intention to sell his sizable stake in the company's native digital currency.  Known as ripples, or XRP, the currency was created as a unit of account and spam prevention tool within the Ripple Labs payment network.  In a post on XRP Talk forum, entitled 'Selling my XRP', McCaleb made his intentions known:  ""I plan to start selling all of my remaining XRP beginning in two weeks. Because I have immense respect for the community members and want to be transparent, I’m publicly announcing this before I start.""  Price drop  In contrast to the buoyant performance of bitcoin as of late, McCaleb's announcement has caused XRP's price to drop precipitously.  On the three largest gateways, or exchanges, for Ripple, the price has declined significantly - all at least by 40%.  McCaleb indicated in his post that he previously held nine billion XRP.  Although McCaleb says he has given a portion of his XRP to charity, his decision to send the sizeable remainder onto the open market is hitting the value of the cryptocurreny.  XRP has now dropped to #7 in the rankings for digital currency market capitalizations.  XRP explained  Ripple allows parties to transmit any form of value across its payment network for free. However, to convert it into something other than XRP requires the use of gateways that charge fees.  The number of ripples in circulation amounts to roughly 100bn XRP. At the inception of Ripple Labs, the company was given 80 billion XRP to manage by giving it to users and investors. The remaining 20 billion went to early founders of the company, including McCaleb.  Arthur Britto, another co-founder of Ripple Labs, posted a statement regarding McCaleb's intentions, and said there is a plan to prevent such actions from the company founders in the future.  Lengthy history  Jed McCaleb already has a lengthy history in the cryptocurrency community. He was the founder of Mt. Gox and sold the now-defunct bitcoin exchange to Mark Karpeles 2011.  McCaleb then founded OpenCoin, which was the precursor to Ripple Labs.  After key founders joined the project, including current CEO Chris Larsen, the company's name was changed to Ripple. McCaleb, for a time, held the role of Chief Technical Officer at the company.  Since stepping down from that position, McCaleb has announced he has been working on a bitcoin-related startup operating in stealth mode.  McCaleb is also a venture partner at Pantera Capitalhttps://panteracapital.com/about/, an investment firm that focuses on the bitcoin industry for its portfolio of holdings.  Pantera most notably invested in Bitstamp, currently the world's largest exchange by BTC volume.

42377272,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX707C1,1400790654,Czech Bitcoin ATM Maker General Bytes Ready to Ship Worldwide,"Fresh from its product unveiling at Bitcoin2014 in Amsterdam, Czech bitcoin ATM company General Bytes is ready to begin shipping eye-catching orange bitcoin 'BATMTwo' machines across Europe and internationally.  The company has operated a prototype machine at the Brmlab Prague Hackerspace ('BATMOne') since February, and introduced another live machine at Cafe Caffeine (also in Prague) at the start of May.  A third machine is being tested at Slovakia for deployment in a major fast food outlet, and General Bytes is shipping a few machines to the Netherlands next week. The company says it currently has another 15 machines built and available for sale.  The BATMTwo models have an email option for customers without pre-existing wallets. The service creates a new address and supplies instructions how it can be accessed via email. This feature also means the machines do not require printers, saving on maintenance costs.  All machines can be setup and configured using General Bytes' server software and web UI, supplied free with any machine purchased.  Compliance measures  The machines are one-way (ie: buy bitcoin only) at this stage and have a series of KYC/AML compliance features to satisfy local authorities where such things are required.  General Bytes' owner Karel Kyovsky said current regulations within the EU limit operators to receiving a maximum €15,000 per month from a single individual.  ATM owner/operators have the ability to set their own limits according to regulations or their own requirements using General Bytes' backend configuration software, and the machines have fingerprint readers to register and identify individuals for large transactions.  For smaller transactions, fingerprints are not required.    ""We are aware that customers don't like to provide their fingerprints, but we believe that in future it might be the only way in some countries to operate the bitcoin ATM.      It is better to get ready now, before the state regulation hits the bitcoin ATM operators.""    To register, customers need to provide two fingerprints and show an ID document to the device's camera, as well as provide an email address. Operators take responsibility for manually confirming the ID and entering the new customer's details in a database using the web UI.  Confirming new registrations takes up to 15 minutes, all of which might discourage spontaneous sign-ups, especially by bitcoin newcomers. General Bytes is negotiating with Jumio to integrate its BISON service and hopefully reduce that time to three minutes.  All the collected KYC data is stored on each BATM operator's own server. Operators thus take responsibility for their own data security, and General Bytes does not have access to it.  Acquiring and setting up  Kyovsky said buyers can purchase any of the 15 available machines (as of 23rd May) and have it delivered within one week. If there are no machines in stock, there will be a 60 day lead time.  Shipping within the EU via UPS is around $40, to the US $150 and other countries up to $200.  Setting up a machine requires about one hour installation time and operators need enough skill to mount it to a wall.  Installing and configuring the backend software takes about two hours, and operators will need to have pre-existing accounts with a bitcoin exchange.  For less technical operators there is the option to use General Bytes' servers and have its staff maintain records, though it will cost a fee of 0.5% per transaction.  Refining the product  Kyovsky said the two machines currently operating in Prague had allowed General Bytes to improve its product.    ""This gives us great insight into what it takes to operate that ATMs also from legal perspective and provides us feedback that we implement into new software releases.      We also use the machines as first place where we deploy new software versions before making them available to our customers.""    The Hackerspace machine even helped General Bytes fix security holes. Hackers with mechanical access to the device discovered a way to send a few mBTC without cash, and were rewarded with a 1 BTC bounty.  Since then, there have been no further security breaches.  General Bytes plans to keep its machine installed at the Hackerspace, saying the alternative mindset there is a perfect match for bitcoin.

42377251,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX706rt,1400787624,Forbes’ Kashmir Hill on What Bitcoin Must Do to Go Mainstream,"Forbes technology and privacy writer Kashmir Hill has become one of the more well-known reporters in the bitcoin community due in part to her viral 'Living on Bitcoin' experiments, extensive series that have chronicled her trials and tribulations using nothing but the digital currency for everyday purchases.  Hill originally conducted the experiment in May 2013 and more recently completed ""Living on Bitcoin: Part Deux"" by popular request, ultimately finding that it has become far easier to conduct purchases without leaving the bitcoin ecosystem.  In her concluding entry in the series, Hill detailed 21 things she learned over the seven-day span, and summed up the vast differences between her experiences in 2013 and 2014, writing:    ""Last year, I had to bike or walk anywhere I wanted to go, lost five pounds, moved out of my home and constantly felt like a crazy person for asking people if they would accept payment in a made-up currency they’d never heard of.      This year, I ate a 17-course dinner, went on a wine tour in Santa Cruz, and was able to use a ride-sharing service for all my trips.""    Still, while Hill's experience led her to conclude that the digital currency ecosystem has come a long way in the past year, she told CoinDesk there is more that the bitcoin industry needs to do to ensure the technology is ready for mainstream use, adding:  ""I still think that there are too many hoops. [...] I don't think I would recommend someone to use bitcoin if they have a credit card, because there are not enough benefits there. [...] I don't think I would tell my dad to open a bitcoin account.""  With this in mind, CoinDesk spoke with Hill at length about her experiences as a bitcoin-only consumer to determine where she believes the industry needs to progress to reach what many believe to be its full, revolutionary potential.  Reducing point-of-sale friction  Hill told CoinDesk that despite bitcoin's promise as an online payments vehicle, it still struggles to compete with more traditional options at the physical point of sale, saying:  ""In terms of using it to pay for a bag of chips, there are so many other options. I still think of it as more useful for online payments than real world ones.""  For example, she cited her experience purchasing lunch at Buyer's Best Friend, where she ultimately had to wait more than one hour for the bitcoin network to confirm her transaction. Rather than opting to try and send the transaction again (and risk paying twice) — she was left to abandon her food, finally placing an order via Foodler's website.  That's not to say all her experiences were full of friction.  Hill noted that one coffee shop in Palo Alto made the experience easy by using a POS system that displayed the USD and BTC prices side-by-side for easy comparison.  However, Hill believes that even these newer solutions require upgrades that balance convenience with the full benefits of bitcoin, adding:  ""[The POS system didn't have] the best privacy, because [it used] the same QR code, so I could theoretically go and look at their past sales.""  Interestingly, she also related how merchants have reported losing time at the point of sale with bitcoin, simply due to conversations with the digital currency's avid users.  Fixing the web wallet problem  Another area where Hill believes the bitcoin ecosystem could improve in the design of its consumer wallets, in particular web-based versions, though she acknowledges that the industry faces an uphill battle against Apple.  Hill explained that, in her experience, even web wallets offered by major players like Blockchain and Coinbase have been difficult to use. She reported that with Coinbase, for instance, it was challenging to figure out how to accept payment, while the way the Blockchain browser interfaces with cell phone cameras could have been improved.  As a Blockchain and Coinbase app user, Hill didn't need to rely on these services, but this was only because of her status as a relative early adopter, having downloaded the apps before they were blocked from Apple's store.  ""If i didn't have those essentially bootleg, banned apps, I would need to have an Android, because sending it from the webpage version of those wallets is not easy to do and is not very well designed right now.""  ""I think bitcoin's adoption right now is being hampered somewhat by Apple's dislike of bitcoin transmissions,"" she added.  Bitcoin banking is key to new markets  One of the more interesting conclusions from Hill's report was her statement that ""bitcoin is an incredibly easy way to instantly open a bank account"".  However, in the interview, she noted that this finding only applies to certain users at present.  She explained that bitcoin is still more advantageous for those who can't access traditional bank accounts, such as the 16-year-old bitcoin fan who commented on her blog and companies like marijuana businesses that have tenuous relationships with big financial providers.  Hill continued, suggesting possible areas where bitcoin entrepreneurs should focus their efforts in order to become a more viable banking service, saying:  ""There's not enough of a bitcoin ecosystem to make it simple. But, I do believe a lot of these use cases – this idea of a worker in the US who wants to send funds back to another place, or an undocumented worker that wants to send money back to their family – being able to do that in bitcoin might be a good way to do that if they can't open a bank account.""  Bitcoin is best in the background  One of Hill's more notable conclusions was her assertion that bitcoin is growing up. She said that, in the process, it has become less ideologically driven in the year since her first 'Living on Bitcoin' piece, explaining:  ""There's been a transition from the quirky weird bitcoin to bitcoin in a suit, and I like all of those kind of idealistic people who like the science-fiction quality of bitcoin. Right now, I think that bitcoin's going through more of its infrastructure growth pains.""  When talking about the future of bitcoin's development, Hill noted that she is intrigued to see how the battle between competing digital currency ideologies will play out, saying that it remains to be seen whether bitcoin will become an independent financial network, provide for easier, more cost-effective payments or both.  While expressing a longing for the earlier, more interesting days of bitcoin, Hill seemed to assert that the digital currency will have the most long-term potential if it falls into the background.  Hill cited Circle and BitReserve as two companies that were a sign of bitcoin's success, even if they downplay their use of the technology, as they are looking to optimize an area that she feels is in need of innovation.  ""Bitcoin should make it really easy, the process – especially if you have an app on your phone – is so much better than swiping a credit card or if you buy online handing over your name, your address, your telephone number, your CV code, that is all so painful and bitcoin is so much better than that.""  As for whether there will be a 'Living on Bitcoin: Part Three', Hill is still unsure.  However, she is currently thinking of ways to alter the format, recognizing that should bitcoin become even more mainstream, living on bitcoin may simply be the norm for many come 2015.

42377253,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX706t9,1400782576,"Bitcoin Pizza Day: Celebrating the Pizzas Bought for 10,000 BTC","Today, bitcoiners the world over will celebrate the anniversary of the most expensive pizzas in history.  Bought on 22nd May 2010 by Laszlo Hanyecz, the programmer paid a fellow Bitcoin Talk forum user 10,000 BTC for two Papa John’s pizzas. Back then – when the technology was just over a year old – that equated to roughly $25, but is $5.12m by today’s exchange rate.  At bitcoin’s all-time high last December, the pizzas would have been worth an eye-watering $11.47m, making them likely candidates for the most expensive pizzas of all time.  Now widely recognised as the first real-world transaction with bitcoin, May 22nd has come to celebrate 'Bitcoin Pizza Day', with cryptocurrency enthusiasts raising a slice to Hanyecz’s infamous hunger pangs that paved the way for early merchant adoption.    @BlueJayKay5 @CookiePounder Not on island at the moment, so I'll be celebrating #BitcoinPizzaDay with a big slice of Ham & Pineapple ;)        — Mrs P TheBitcoinWife (@TheBitcoinWife) April 30, 2014      Then and now  ""It wasn’t like bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool,"" Hanyecz told Nick Bilton in a recent interview with The New York Times. ""No one knew it was going to get so big.""  Yet, the picture today is vastly different. Worldwide, there are more than 70,000 merchants accepting the young currency, with block chain transactions now averaging over 57,000 per day.  In addition, data from coinmap.org indicates that more than 100 brick-and-mortar stores currently accept bitcoin for pizza – and this number is on the rise.  Business tie-ins  Retailers are getting in on the action, too. eGifter, the popular gift card platform is giving away extra points to customers purchasing Domino's, UNO and Papa John’s gift cards using either bitcoin, litecoin or dogecoin.  The company is also providing a 10,000-point prize in honour of the 10,000 BTC used in Hanyecz's transaction.  E-commerce platform provider snapCard is similarly commemorating Bitcoin Pizza Day by giving away 150 cheese pizzas for $0.99. At press time, the company was reporting an enthusiastic response, with roughly 30 orders placed in the first 10 minutes of the offer going live.  Closer to CoinDesk's headquarters, Takeaway.com lets UK customers choose from over 7,500 listed restaurants for home delivery, many of which may not even realise they are accepting the currency (albeit indirectly). After a quick postcode search for 'pizza' outlets, we decided to put the service to the test.    Surely enough, Papa John's – Hanyecz's brand of choice – came top.      A few clicks and a Blockchain web wallet workaround later (a drawback of using iOS) the pizzas were on their way.

42377262,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7070h,1400772883,Canadian Lawyer Plans World's First Book on Bitcoin Law,"A Canadian lawyer is planning to write the world’s first law book covering bitcoin and other digital currencies.  To help in the complex task, Christine Duhaime has already prepared a team of collaborators, including economists, legal experts and financial crime experts.  The book will aim to provide guidance and insight into the emerging field of digital currencies and tackle legislative issues on a global level.  Duhaime is a partner at Duhaime Law, a financial crime lawyer and a certified anti-money laundering law specialist. She advises clients on financial regulation and financial crime compliance.  Crypto jurisprudence  “I am thrilled to have the opportunity to write about the evolving law surrounding bitcoin and other digital currencies,” she said, adding:  “As the US Federal Reserve noted only weeks ago, bitcoin’s disruptive technology may force banks and other financial institutions to adapt and change the way they provide services to consumers and it will open new markets for business all over the world.”  Duhaime stressed that it is important that law keeps up with developments in the bitcoin space, and added that Canada is likely to be the first jurisdiction in the world with a federal law on bitcoin.  Canada’s position on bitcoin has always been progressive and the country’s government is currently debating amendments to existing legislation necessary to regulate digital currencies.  Role in crime prevention  Duhaime believes bitcoin could play a big role in crime prevention and she plans to explore both the legal perils of bitcoin and its promises.  “For example, the £4bn carbon credit frauds that took place in the European Union could have been prevented if carbon credit exchanges were operated on the bitcoin protocol because it has built-in fraud prevention mechanisms, something that is not well-known,” she explained.  In addition to traditional applications, Duhaime believes bitcoin has incredible potential to provide financial services to millions of people who do not have access to traditional financial services, including refugees, people in developing countries and women in destitute conditions.  “It also has the potential to eliminate global economic disparity,” said Duhaime. “But there are legal issues with such fundamental legal and economic shifts that need to be addressed in the legal literature and that’s what we’re doing.”  Duhaime said she plans to publish the book later this year.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/05/22/canadian-lawyer-plans-worlds-first-book-on-bitcoin-law,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/124f8deb1986fc15909e0370e42a68acba63284f-1000x920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377287,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7073D,1400769486,Chain's API Takes the Hard Work Out of Bitcoin App Development,"Developing for bitcoin can be a bit of a slog. The protocol was designed with transactions, not applications, in mind, and getting to grips with the technology can be intimidating, not only for the general public, but for developers too.  All of that may be about to change thanks to Chain, a new bitcoin infrastructure that could make it easier than ever for developers to build on top of the technology.  Enthusiasts often dream of the applications that could be created with bitcoin's technology; Chain could finally attract the critical mass of developers needed to turn that dream into reality.  The company was born partly out of frustration, said Chain’s Matt Matteson, whose resume includes being the Path's first employeehttp://nsbrief.com/117-matt-matteson/:  “I felt like I'd enter the weekend with a really great idea [for an application] but I'd spend three weekends just trying to get these [bitcoin] nodes running in a way that was useful for my application.”  Technological hairball  Bitcoin is often talked about it near-messianic terms as a technology. Much of it is deserved: bitcoin really is an incredible innovation in terms of creating decentralized digital infrastructure and, for the first time ever, we are able to have a decentralized digital form of money, for example.  When it comes to the code itself, however, bitcoin developers are more sober.  At the Bitcoin2014 conference, the Bitcoin Foundation’s Lead Scientist Gavin Andresen quipped that “Satoshi gave us a bit of hairball”, and later said that “the very first version of bitcoin was horribly unsecure [sic]”.  Even downloading the block chain, the ledger of all transacations, can be a painful task, as lead developer Wladimir van der Laan told CoinDesk in April:  “The reason for this is that it downloads from one node at a time. If this is a slow node, too bad.”  Developer boost  Although the code is constantly being improved, Andresen is clear that the focus will continue be to ensure “the core bitcoin network processes transactions as reliably as possible.”  That leaves the door open for someone else to instead focus on making the core bitcoin network as easily accessible to developers as possible.  “There's nothing broken per se about running your own bitcoin infrastructure. It's just very time consuming, very cumbersome and very expensive” said Chain’s Adam Ludwin, who is perhaps most well-known for being an early investor in Vine. “That has limited the number of developers who are willing to jump in and build something on nights and weekends.”  Instead of each developer having to start from scratch, Chain will do a lot of the heavy lifting for them. In effect, Chain is a copy of the data on the block chain that is organized and saved in a way that's less optimised for processing transactions and more optimised for building applications.  “The [bitcoin] community is better served, in our opinion, by having one company that's well understood, trusted, open source and who does nothing but focus on the reliability and strength of this [new data] layer,” argues Ludwin.  Launched this week, Chain currently provides three basic functions for developers, returning details for addresses, transactions and blocks, and so far only supports bitcoin.  Developers can expect over a dozen more functions and support for litecoin, dogecoin and namecoin in the future, said Ludwin:  “Developers should expect to see a lot of features – don't even think a year, think 60 days.”  To ensure that it will be as secure as possible, and to give the community confidence about that security, Chain will be entirely open source.  ""We're not fans of centralizing a service and introducing new risks to the ecosystem,"" Ludwin said.  Chain is currently free, but business applications of the API will be charged for in future. The team is also building SDKs (software development kits) for bitcoin developers on Android.  Company history  Currently comprising eight members, including an alumni of cloud platform Heroku, Chain was formerly the team behind Albumatic – a photo sharing app that attracted a lot of coverage, but failed to reach critical mass.  It then morphed into Koa.la last November and began building apps for messaging platform Kik, on whose board of directors Ludwin serves.  Around January this year, however, the team was expanded as part of a hard pivot to Chain, which has carried forward Albumatic’s $4.2 million series-A funding from investors including Thrive, SV Angel and RRE Ventures, where Ludwin is a venture partner.  Later this year, the Chain team will be heading to bitcoin conferences and university campuses to demonstrate the potential of their API. With Chain, student developers will be able to build bitcoin applications over a single weekend, said Ludwin:  “You can be a 19-year-old first year computer science student and you can do that because we've added this layer above the infrastructure that allows people to build quickly.”  If Chain is successful in encouraging more and more developers to start working with bitcoin, maybe we’ll really start to see what’s possible with this technology.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | TECHNOLOGY,Kadhim Shubber,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/05/22/chains-api-takes-the-hard-work-out-of-bitcoin-app-development,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e85d6a4ffc04033f11ebcd5a321118faa939518e-2000x1253.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377264,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7075j,1400763646,The First In-Casino Bitcoin ATM Launches in Las Vegas,"Tourists visiting the gambling and entertainment mecca of the US can now get their cryptocurrency at The D Las Vegas Casino Hotel.  The D has partnered with Robocoin, a fellow Las Vegas-based company, to place a bitcoin ATM inside its casino.  The machine allows users to both buy and sell the currency. Derek Stevens, CEO of the D Las Vegas Casino Hotel, said in a statement:  ""We’re proud to be the first casino property to accept bitcoin and we’re excited to offer our customers the convenience of a bitcoin ATM.""  Vegas and compliance  The D Casino Hotel is located downtown on Fremont Street, distanced from the main Las Vegas Strip. Stevens refers to this area of Las Vegas as a ""growing high-tech hub"".  Earlier this year, the casino became the first to accept bitcoin for hotel stays, restaurants and gift shop items. However, The D does not currently accept bitcoin for its gaming operations.  ""The Nevada Gaming Control Board would have to approve [bitcoin for gambling], which seems unlikely for the foreseeable future,"" said Sam Glaser, Robocoin's CMO.  However, D Casino Hotel's Stevens previously told CoinDesk he thinks the Nevada Gaming Commission is closely looking at bitcoin for future use.  Jordan Kelly, CEO of Robocoin, says bringing a bitcoin ATM to the compliance-heavy market of Las Vegas is a sign of progress:  ""[We're launching] in the highly regulated state of Nevada. These are all signs of bitcoin maturity and institutional acceptance.""  About Robocoin  Robocoin launched one of the first bitcoin ATMs in the world last October inside a Vancouver coffeehouse.  It recently announced a rebranding of its ATM services as Robocoin Bank to offer features more commonly found in financial institutions.  Robocoin partners with local operators that can work with regulators in their jurisdictions. This is to ensure that the machines are compliant with regional standards.  Kelley, the Robocoin CEO, said in a statement that The D Casino Hotel is only a block away from the company's headquarters in Las Vegas, which is an exciting development:  ""We couldn’t be happier to install Robocoin in our hometown and the D is a perfect fit,"" he said.  ""This is the first step towards bitcoin’s ultimately critical role in gaming’s infrastructure and Robocoins appearing in casinos everywhere,"" Robocoin's CTO Sam Glaser added.  The largest rival Robocoin has in the bitcoin ATM market is Lamassu. Working with a local operator, Lamassu was able to get the first US-based bitcoin ATM up and running in New Mexico earlier this year.

42377266,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7076z,1400759420,Estonian Bitcoin Week a Success Despite Tough Regulatory Environment,"With the cryptocurrency becoming increasingly popular in Estonia, a bitcoin focus week has kicked off in the country's capital, Tallinn.  The event was organized to boost popularity of the digital currency in the Baltic state, which has seen a tough stance from its authorities in past months.  The week-long series of events was launched on 18th May by a number of Estonia-based bitcoin advocates that include Silver Meikar, former Estonian MP who is currently running for the European Parliament, and Finnish businessman Risto Pietilä.  Notably, Meikar and Pietilä recently proposed a plan to open an educational and thematic centre to promote increased use of bitcoin in the Estonian economy, according to Otto de Voogd, one of the country’s leading bitcoin entrepreneurs, who was speaking to local broadcaster ERR.  The new bitcoin centre is planned to be sited in a manor purchased by Pietilä in northern Estonia earlier this year.  Bitcoin showcase  Meikar is a self-described human rights and digital rights activist, who served as an Estonian MP in the years 2003-2004 and 2006-2011.  He famously criticized the financing practices of the country’s Reform Party (RE) in 2012, and since then has been independent of party affiliation. In the run up to this month’s European Parliament elections, Meikar is campaigning to represent his country at the European level.  Kicking off the bitcoin week on 18th May, Meikar met for a lunch and press brief with local journalists at Sushi Cat, a Japanese restaurant and also one of the first places to accept payment in bitcoin in Tallinn.  The politician paid €78.5 ($107.50) for food and drinks in bitcoin with the use of an app on his cellphone, and uploaded a photo of the bill to his twitter account.

Shame, that Estonia gov policy is overregulation and fighting innovation. pic.twitter.com/CkUhx3PrxF      — Silver Meikar (@meikar) May 18, 2014    Conference and workshops  Meanwhile, with a rising number of Estonia-based businesses interested in enabling payments in the cryptocurrency, the bitcoin focus week includes a wide range of events designed to bring together bitcoin enthusiasts and those who want to find out more about how digital currencies work.  On Monday, a number of bitcoin-related workshops were hosted by Estonia’s National Library, and on Wednesday, Tallinn University hosted a conference titled 'Has Bitcoin Come to Stay?' with presentations by Voogd and both local and foreign digital currency experts.  The conference was concluded with a panel discussion by the featured speakers.  In addition, the conference’s organizers presented the first bitcoin ATM in Estonia, which was supplied by Lamassu.  Tickets for the conference were available online, with payment in digital currency as one of the available options. The price was set by the organizers at 0.03 BTC ($15.30).  Police crackdown  In addition to being one of the leading forces behind the ongoing bitcoin focus week, de Voogd was also one of the first bitcoin investors to be targeted by the Estonian police, as reported by CoinDesk in February.  At the same time, local bitcoin trading site BTC.ee announced via its website that it had “temporarily stopped trading due to threats issued by the Estonian police”.  The move followed a warning about bitcoin and other digital currencies issued by a member of Estonia’s central bank earlier this year, in which he called bitcoin a “Ponzi scheme” and said it deserves “some caution”.  The site’s owner said he had received emails from the Estonian Financial Intelligence Unit and Border Guard Board stating that he was required to provide personal information on the platform’s users and proof that BTC.ee was operating in compliance with the Estonian regulation.  Should he fail to do so, he could be sentenced to three years in prison and a fine of up to €32,000 ($44,000), under Estonian law, they reportedly said.  ""Due to threats issued by the Estonian police, I have personally stopped trading bitcoins. I am now engaged in a court battle against the Estonian police,” de Voogd told ERR.  High-tech governance  The country's tough stance on bitcoin is rather at odds with Estonia’s notable achievements in the field of e-democracy.  The country was one of the first to introduce a number of IT solutions into its political system, enabling the government to hold meetings online. Additionally it held the first legally-binding general vote via the Internet in 2005.  Estonia is also a pioneer in the field of reducing administrative costs and red tape through the use of IT.  The first version of the country’s flagship E-Business Register was launched in 1999, and by 2009, 70% of all company submissions were made over the Internet via the system. An Estonian government website claims that, in its latest version, the register allows the creation of a new legal entity within 18 minutes.  The state-run Centre of Registries and Information Systems has said that, in the near future, foreigners will have an opportunity to apply for an Estonian e-resident ID card allowing them to use Estonian online services, open bank accounts, and start companies without having to be present in the country.

42377260,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7071x,1400755258,Charlie Shrem No Longer Under 24-Hour House Arrest,"Charlie Shrem, a bitcoin entrepreneur facing federal money laundering charges, is no longer under 24-hour house arrest.  Shrem  still has restrictions related to his legal situation that include a curfew and limits on his ability to travel, but the modification allows the 24-year-old to pursue work opportunities, provided he does not leave New York.  The changes to Shrem's home confinement terms give him the ability to leave his residence between the hours of 9am and 9pm, Sunday through Thursday.  He is restricted to the geography of New York City, and must continue wearing a GPS monitoring device on his person. Shrem is also supposed to provide the authorities with verification of employment upon request.  Arrest and bail  Shrem was arrested on 27th February in New York's LaGuardia Airport, and has been under house arrest since posting $1m bail.  He was indicted on 15th April along with alleged co-conspirator Robert Faiella, also known as 'BTCKing'. The two are charged with two counts of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, one count of money laundering conspiracy and one count of wilful failure to file a suspicious activity report.  As an executive of the now-defunct bitcoin processor BitInstant, the federal government claims that Shrem failed to alert authorities regarding suspected money laundering.  The charges, filed in the United States District Court Southern District of New York, allege Shrem was complicit in helping provide bitcoin for Silk Road users.  Similarly, lawyers representing alleged Silk Road mastermind Ross Ulbricht, who was also arrested in connection with the drugs marketplace, have asked his money laundering charges to be dismissed, due to the fact that bitcoin is not yet considered 'money'.  Attorney Joshua Dratel argued that money laundering regulations cannot apply to bitcoin, as it not an instrument that can be used in a financial transaction in the eye of the law.

42377259,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX706yB,1400747939,Bitcoin Buoyant as Price Surges Past $500,"Bitcoin passed the $500 mark for the first time in weeks this morning. At press time, the price stood at $513.93 – down from a peak of $518.22 a short time earlier.  The Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) has been climbing steadily since 20th May and started nearing the psychologically important threshold at around 6.00am (BST) today.  Apart from a brief spike in mid-April, bitcoin has been trading south of the $500 mark since late March.  Renewed optimism  A number of positive developments over the past couple of weeks helped reverse the negative narrative and bring back a healthy dose of optimism.  The Bitcoin2014 conference in Amsterdam was a widely considered a success and received significant coverage. The same is true of BitPay's recent record-breaking series-A funding round, which saw the payment processor raise $30m in investment.  There were some positive developments on the regulatory front too, and Circle finally revealed its product roadmap aimed at the mainstream market.  What comes next?  It is difficult to make any predictions, but the renewed optimism and positive media buzz are encouraging. Bitcoin got a lot of negative coverage following the arrest of Charlie Shrem, the collapse of Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox and regulatory clampdown in China.  All these factors contributed to a massive price slide earlier this year. However, for all the talk of bitcoin volatility and hype-fed bubble, the price has remained relatively stable since the slump.  A month ago the price stood at $484, a month before that it was at $564 and on February 22 it was $604. Compared to national currencies, these are still significant swings, but they pale in comparison to what the market went through in November and December.  It remains to be seen whether this will be yet another short-lived spike, but the overall trend is positive for the time being.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/05/22/bitcoin-buoyant-as-price-surges-past-500,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6b9bb689ba8e37754460232259166309215f4fd7-900x500.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377268,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX707Al,1400725132,Japanese Politicians Take Interest in Growing Bitcoin Ecosystem,"At least two members of parliament from Japan's governing party have shown a keen interest in bitcoin, holding discussions with local advocates and even attending gatherings of Tokyo's regular Meetup group.  One is Mineyuki Fukuda, who became interested in bitcoin after reading news stories. In an effort to learn more, he has gone directly to sources and arranged meetings at his parliamentary office with locally-based bitcoiners (including CoinDesk) to gauge opinions and hear recommendations on bitcoin policy.  He also met a team from California-based digital currency exchange Kraken, including CEO Jesse Powell and Japanese-born Ayako Miyaguchi, to hear an industry perspective.  ""Which country do you think has the best policy towards bitcoin at the moment?"" asked Fukuda-san. ""And what approach would you like to see Japan take?""  Continued participation by Mr. Fukuda and at least one other representative are thanks in part to Keiichi Hida, who organizes the local group 'Rising Bitcoin Japan' and has campaigned for months to bring bitcoin out of the shadows and into mainstream attention.  Hida realizes the importance of gaining political support for bitcoin's cause, given the often-negative coverage it received in the past from the Japanese media following various scandals. Politicians' interest is also genuine, he added.  ""I think that he trusts and feels the strong economy of digital currency,"" Hida said of Fukuda's efforts.  Attendance at bitcoin meetup groups by sitting members of parliament or Congress is almost unheard-of in other large countries, yet that is exactly what has happened in Japan this year.  The two members have both come along to the group's Thursday night meetings to talk to both Japanese and expat bitcoin businesspeople and learn more about the ecosystem first-hand.  Not official policy  Interest from individual members, of course, does not constitute official government support for digital currencies.  Despite a lack of official endorsement, Japanese authorities have taken a hands-off approach to bitcoin-related activity so far. As the world's third-largest economy and one of its major financial centers, it makes Japan one of the world's most significant jurisdictions to take such a stance.  Minister of State for Financial Services (and former Prime Minister) Taro Aso said recently in a TV interview about bitcoin:  ""We're in charge of money. If it's not money, it's not the Ministry of Finance/Financial Services Authority's jurisdiction.""  No capital gains?  Recent coverage in local news agencies suggested that while the government wanted to crack down on bitcoin-related crime, applying capital gains tax would be difficult for digital currency investments and there was no intention to impose one ""at this point"".  As some have pointed out, though, having no official policy is not always the most secure option.  Uncertainty leaves the government's options open to change its mind and introduce regulation at some future point. One local bitcoin entrepreneur said:  ""A continued hands-off approach probably makes sense, but the lack of clarity about what will happen in the future – for example, the uncertainty over whether you need to pay consumption tax on selling bitcoins – makes it harder for responsible people to enter the market, and risks leaving it to people who either don't understand the law or aren't interested in following it.""  Existing tax laws, even those pertaining to capital gains tax, could be interpreted to already apply to bitcoin as it applies to gains on any investment, said Dr. Karl-Friedrich Lenz, a law professor at Aoyama Gakuin University.  Applying consumption tax would require a more precise definition of bitcoin's status as a means of payment or otherwise.  The Japan scene expands  Mention to anyone overseas that you're a bitcoiner from Tokyo and the conversation switches instantly to Mt. Gox. ""Were you there?"" they want to know.  Indeed, Mt. Gox was the easiest exchange to use for Japan residents thanks to local bank access and its ability to verify Japanese ID documents without the need for official translations.  News of fund recovery notwithstanding, though, most bitcoin enthusiasts in Japan would rather put the whole sordid affair behind them and move on. As well as Rising Bitcoin Japan there is another advocacy group called the Japan Digital Money Association, representing Japanese-speaking startups and mining operations.  Media attention  At the peak of Mt. Gox's problems the Tokyo Bitcoin Meetup Group attracted more than 50 participants to its regular meeting, and was nearly expelled from its meeting place due to the presence of at least three TV news crews and local newspaper journalists.  Bitcoin coverage in the local mainstream media tended to be curious but overly-focused on Silk Road and drug sales, though it has attracted more serious attention from the local business press.  The respected financial-business print magazine Nikkei Weekly gave bitcoin a cover and nearly one-third of that week's edition, generally positive.  Local Wall Street Journal reporters Takashi Mochizuki and Eleanor Warnock have provided plenty of explanatory coverage, and the WSJ is hosting a 'Tech Cafe' event in Tokyo about bitcoin with expert panels on 22nd May.
