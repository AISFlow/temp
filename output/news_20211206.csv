42424129,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2koJh,1638833400,"First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Tops $50K, Ether, Other Altcoins Rise","Good morning. Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market moves: All eyes were on the Chinese stock market, as bitcoin funding rates on Chinese derivatives exchanges slowly recovered from negative territory.  Technician’s take: Bitcoin was stabilizing above its 20-day average two days after its 20% plummet.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $50,509 +2.3%  Ether (ETH): $4,324 +3.1%  Markets  S&P 500: $4,591 +1.1%  Dow Jones Industrial Average: $35,227 +1.8%  Nasdaq: $15,225 0.9%  Gold: $1,778 -0.2%  Market moves  Bitcoin inched up on Monday two days after plummeting over 20%, and at one point, neared $51,000. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading well over $50,000 at the time of publication. Trading volume was even lower than a day ago across major centralized exchanges. Ether was up over 3% to $4,324.  According to Singapore-based crypto trading firm QCP Capital, bitcoin’s average funding rate, or the cost of holding long positions in the perpetual futures listed on exchanges popular among Chinese traders, including Huobi, OKEx and Bybit, recovered from negative territory much more slowly than the funding rate on other major exchanges such as Deribit. (Exchanges calculate funding rates every eight hours.)  “This indicates persistent selling out of China,” QCP Capital wrote in its Telegram channel on Monday, citing “bad news” from China, including China ride-hailing giant Didi’s announcement to delist from the New York Stock Exchange. Other Chinese tech stocks tumbled following the news, as investors worried that other Chinese tech firms would be pressured to follow Didi’s move.  Meanwhile, China real estate giant Evergrande Group’s stocks and bonds both fell to historically low levels, as the Chinese government stepped up its involvement in the company’s management. The deeply indebted Chinese real estate developer has been an important factor in the performance of crypto and broader financial markets, CoinDesk has reported previously.  Technician’s take  Bitcoin Drops Below $56K as Momentum Slows, Support at $53K  Bitcoin is stabilizing above its 200-day moving average, currently at $46,000, after a nearly 20% sell-off over the weekend. The cryptocurrency was roughly flat over the past 24 hours, and was trading at around $49,000 at the end of the New York trading session. BTC is down about 15% over the past week.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is the most oversold since July, which preceded a strong price recovery. Still, oversold conditions could persist for several days as sellers gradually exit positions.  BTC is poised for a short-term bounce, although upside appears to be limited toward the $55,000-$60,000 resistance zone. Over the long term, weekly momentum indicators have shifted negative for the first time since April, which preceded a brief crypto bear market.

42424115,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2knvh,1638829360,Craig Wright Found Not Liable for Breach of Kleiman Business Partnership,"MIAMI – A federal jury found that Craig Wright, the Australian who claims to have invented Bitcoin, didn’t have a business partnership with deceased Florida computer forensics expert Dave Kleiman, but he does owe $100 million in compensatory damages for conversion to a company Kleiman founded in Florida, W&K Info Defense Research.  “I feel remarkably happy and vindicated,” Wright said in the courtroom hallway after the verdict was announced. “I am not a fraud, and I never have been.” He added that he had offered Kleiman’s estate, represented by Dave’s brother Ira Kleiman, “12 million many years ago, which if he had taken that then in bitcoin, when bitcoin was $200, and he kept it – you can do the math.”  Wright testified that he was friends with Dave Kleiman and that Kleiman helped him edit a white paper that explained the foundation of Bitcoin, but he insisted the two weren’t business partners. Dave Kleiman died in 2013, and his brother brought the federal civil lawsuit on behalf of Dave Kleiman’s estate and W&K.  Of the verdict against W&K, Wright said it means that “I owe my ex-wife more money.” He was referring to the fact that Ira Kleiman’s control of W&K is being challenged in court in Palm Beach County, where Wright’s ex-wife, Lynn Wright, and current wife, Ramona Watts (she filed as Ramona Ang), each claim to control a third of W&K and are suing Ira Kleiman, alleging he didn’t have authority to bring the federal suit. Those cases have been on hold pending the outcome of the federal suit.  The jury wasn’t asked to decide on the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin. Both sides in the suit based the suit on the assumption that Wright was either entirely or partly responsible for the creation of the cryptocurrency, with Wright’s defense stating he alone created Bitcoin and Kleiman’s side arguing that it was a partnership between Wright and Dave Kleiman. Wright’s claims to be Satoshi, however, have been widely discredited and none of them was tested in court.  Vel Freedman, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said his team, too, was happy with the verdict: “We just won $100 million!”  It was far short of what he had asked for: up to $36 billion for the value of bitcoin in dispute, $126 billion for intellectual property and $17 billion in punitive damages.  With his fellow attorneys, Kyle Roche and Andrew Brenner, Freedman issued the following statement:  We are immensely gratified that our client, W&K Information Defense Research LLC, has won $100,000,000 reflecting that Craig Wright wrongfully took bitcoin-related assets from W&K. Many years ago, Craig Wright told the Kleiman family that he and Dave Kleiman developed revolutionary Bitcoin based intellectual property. Despite those admissions, Wright refused to give the Kleimans their fair share of what Dave helped create and instead took those assets for himself. This verdict sets a historical precedent in the innovative and transformative industry of cryptocurrency and blockchain. Our firms, Roche Freedman and Boies Schiller Flexner, are honored they represented the Plaintiffs, protected Dave Kleiman’s legacy, and ensured his family receives the benefits of his labor.  Read More: Kleiman v. Wright: Bitcoin’s Trial of the Century Kicks Off in Miami  During the jury’s fifth week in the courtroom, it decided Wright and Dave Kleiman weren’t in a business partnership, and thus the plaintiffs aren’t owed a portion of the partnership’s assets, which the plaintiffs believe to include about 1.1 million BTC and intellectual property such as software.  The jury did rule that Wright owes W&K Info Defense Research $100 million for intellectual property, but didn’t define what intellectual property it believed Wright converted. Over the course of the trial, both the plaintiffs and Wright’s defense team described a variety of projects, including “testnet bitcoins” and white papers on subjects, including hard drives and supercomputers, as intellectual property owned by W&K.  The jury was asked to consider damages in both bitcoin and dollars, but chose to award the $100 million in damages in fiat currency alone, writing “0 BTC” on the line for bitcoin damages.  Conversion is a form of theft that involves taking unauthorized control of another’s property.  The jurors were asked to evaluate whether they believed:  Wright was liable to Dave Kleiman’s estate for breach of a business partnership;  whether Wright was liable to the estate for conversion;  whether Wright was liable to W&K (the joint venture) for conversion;  whether the plaintiffs proved their case for civil theft;  whether Wright was liable for fraud to the plaintiffs;  whether Wright was liable for breach of fiduciary duty to W&K; and  whether Wright was liable for unjust enrichment against the plaintiffs.  Ultimately, the jury found Wright not liable for the majority of the charges.  ‘Depressing’ outcome for Kleiman  Ira Kleiman wasn’t in the courtroom today but told CoinDesk last week as the case dragged on, “I’m depressed. We thought they would return a favorable verdict in a day.”  Ira Kleiman is a quiet man who has largely avoided the press, while Wright has a host of supporters who are active online. Feeling that his side of the story had been drowned out, Ira Kleiman added a section to the website DaveKleiman.com highlighting details from exhibits in his court case that he hoped readers would see.  That included emails Craig Wright wrote to various people, saying things like, “Dave Kleiman and I started mining in 2009. So we have a few things that will interest them. It is a shame Dave died last year before fruition, but all is moving ahead”; “I was not the person doing the mining. Dave was.”; and “Satoshi was a team. Without the other part of the team, he died.”  Ira Kleiman was frustrated that given such pronouncements, the jury hadn’t easily found in his favor.  His own lawyers, however, had spent much of the trial insisting that Wright forged and backdated documents – a position backed up by a magistrate judge overseeing the case before the trial began in November.  In August 2019, Bruce Reinhart, the judge, issued a sanctions order against Wright, stating:  “The evidence establishes that he has engaged in a willful and bad faith pattern of obstructive behavior, including submitting incomplete or deceptive pleadings, filing a false declaration, knowingly producing a fraudulent trust document, and giving perjurious testimony at the evidentiary hearing.”  The sanctions order was vacated by U.S. District Judge Beth Bloom, the presiding judge, before the trial began.  Wright’s defense team accused plaintiffs of “cherry-picking,” presenting the documents that fit their narrative as legitimate and others as forged.  It was clear the jurors were uncomfortable making decisions in the case. On Wednesday they said they couldn’t agree on any of the counts, but Bloom directed them to continue deliberating.  Wright told CoinDesk last week that Ira Kleiman would have trouble collecting any verdict awarded to W&K, as his ex-wife and an entity tied to him own two-thirds of the company – a matter that is being litigated in court in Palm Beach County.  BSV, the offshoot of bitcoin Craig Wright is involved in, rallied as much as 13% Monday following the resolution of the Kleiman case.

42424133,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2koLh,1638826711,Market Wrap: Cryptocurrency Sell-Off Pauses as Sentiment Turns Bearish,"Cryptocurrencies were mostly lower on Monday, although market conditions have stabilized following the weekend sell-off. Bitcoin was trading above its 200-day moving average (currently at $46,386), which suggests selling pressure could wane over the short term.  Analysts pointed out that excess leverage in the bitcoin futures market contributed to the broad sell-off. And despite room for a short-term price bounce, some analysts remain cautious about bitcoin’s price direction over the next few weeks.  “The previous two times that BTC challenged the 200-day moving average served as good buying opportunities, as the market remained structurally bullish but was simply over-leveraged.” Sean Farrell, a digital strategist at Fundstrat Global Advisors, wrote in a newsletter.  Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $48,954, +0.5%  Ether (ETH): $4,226, +2.7%  S&P 500: +1.2%  Gold: $1,779, -0.2%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.443%  “It must be noted, though, that one of the key bitcoin bull market indicators – the 20-week simple moving average – has now been decisively breached so the outlook is currently bearish in the short to medium term,” Anto Paroian, chief operating officer at crypto hedge fund ARK36, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  “The violent price move in the digital asset market may also suggest that some investors are preparing to go into a risk-off mode for the time being,” Paroian wrote.  Still, it appears that some investors are comfortable with rotating back into speculative assets. For example, traditional equities stabilized on Monday as volatility declined. And in crypto markets, alternative coins such as ether, Polygon’s MATIC token and Solana’s SOL token have outperformed bitcoin over the past week, suggesting investors’ greater appetite for risk.  Extreme liquidation  The chart below shows the largest one-day decline in BTC futures open interest since Sept. 7. And blockchain data suggests the sell-off accelerated as the BTC price dipped below break-even levels (cost basis) for many traders holding long positions.  “Bitcoin short term holders’ cost basis was sitting at $53K, and once we broke through that level, there was another big leg down,” Martha Reyes, head of research at digital asset prime brokerage and exchange BEQUANT.io, said.  Bitcoin drawdown  Bitcoin has dropped nearly 30% from its all-time price of around $69,000, which is the largest drawdown (percent decline from peak to trough) since September. Typically, bitcoin experiences sharp drawdowns between 10%-20% even in a bull market. In a bear market, however, drawdowns can extend well beyond 30%, and the price can take several months to recover.  Altcoin roundup  Polygon attracts fundraising attention from Sequoia, Steadview: A group of venture capital investors including Sequoia Capital India and Steadview Capital are in talks to back Ethereum-scaling network Polygon with an investment of between $50 million and $150 million, CoinDesk’s Jamie Crawley reported. The investment would reportedly take the form of a purchase of MATIC tokens, the cryptocurrency that powers the Polygon network. Polygon is a “sidechain” that aims to solve the scalability problems associated with the Ethereum network, which has suffered from congestion and high fees.  Metaverse tokens plummet amid broader crypto market sell-off: Decentraland (MANA), the top-ranking metaverse asset according to the cryptocurrency analysis firm Messari, is down 25% in the last seven days, CoinDesk’s Lyllah Ledesma reported . MANA’s drop is followed closely by Axie Infinity’s AXS token, which is down 23% in the last seven days. The AXS market cap stands at $6.21 billion. It had reached a high of $9.77 billion on Nov. 7, according to CoinMarketCap. Matthew Dibb, Stack Funds’ chief operating officer and co-founder, said that while the future of the metaverse and gaming tokens looks bright, there is very little real adoption in the present.

42420822,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYl6z,1638825719,"Wrapped Bitcoin’s Supply Has More Than Doubled, but BadgerDAO Hack Exposed Risks of Moving Bitcoin to Ethereum","Last week’s hack on decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol BadgerDAO put a major but less talked-about cryptocurrency in the spotlight once again.  Wrapped bitcoin, an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain that is collateralized 1-to-1 with bitcoin, has more than doubled its supply from a year ago, as traders and investors seek alternative high-yield opportunities in DeFi.  The rapidly growing demand for WBTC comes as yields for bitcoin borrowing and lending have grown less competitive compared with the lucrative DeFi lending market. But the hack on BadgerDAO, which focuses on high yields on wrapped bitcoin, has raised concerns around the security of moving bitcoin to the Ethereum blockchain. The hack led to the loss of 2,100 bitcoins at an estimated value of $118 million, China-based blockchain security and data analytics firm PeckShield wrote in a Dec. 2 tweet.  According to data compiled by user @Messari_Jack on Dune Analytics, the total supply of WBTC was roughly 253,876 on Dec. 1, up from 112,948 at the end of 2020. The top WBTC merchants for minting WBTC include Alameda Research, CoinList, Grapefruit Trading and Three Arrows Capital. Alameda alone has minted more than 9,6547.2 WBTC.  The total value locked in WBTC stands at roughly $12.53 billion, the fifth-largest DeFi protocol by TVL, according to DeFi Llama. TVL represents the dollar value of all tokens locked in the smart contracts of a decentralized lending project.  “It turns out that it’s currently easier to borrow and lend with WBTC than BTC since users can interact with DeFi lending protocols like Compound, Aave and Maker to lend their WBTC and borrow USDC, dai, or other assets against it,” Joe Keefer, a trader at Grapefruit Trading, one of the biggest WBTC merchants, told CoinDesk on Telegram. “There are also many opportunities to use WBTC directly in yield farming.”  On centralized lending platforms such as BlockFi and Celsius, the interest rate for bitcoin borrowing was as high as 6.20% at the time of publication, far lower than the rates from the lucrative yield farming on DeFi protocols using different trading strategies.  Instead of going to a centralized lending platform, traders can, for example, use WBTC as collateral on the MakerDAO platform to mint Maker’s own stablecoin, dai. The WBTC-generated dai could be used for many purposes, including lending dai at interest, as CoinDesk has reported.  “The yields on bitcoin are very low,” Dan Burke, managing director for institutional sales at crypto custody company BitGo, told CoinDesk via a direct message. With WBTC, “you can put it into any Ethereum-based DeFi pool or DEX [decentralized exchange].”  However, greater rewards often come with greater risks as the BadgerDAO exploit showed.  According to BadgerDAO’s official website, the protocol offers its users several automated strategies to earn yield on bitcoin-pegged assets, including WBTC and its own interest-bearing bitcoin (ibBTC).  Crypto lender Celsius Network confirmed that it lost money from the hack without disclosing the exact value of the loss. By tracking blockchain data, some observers estimated Celsius’ loss at roughly $51 million via WBTC, but Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky said in a YouTube livestream that the lost funds belonged to the company and that no users had lost money from the hack.  “It was a Badger hack, but some of the Celsius funds were there, so Celsius lost money,” Mashinsky said. “But none of the Celsius members lost money.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/06/wrapped-bitcoins-supply-has-more-than-doubled-but-the-badgerdao-hack-exposed-risks-of-moving-bitcoin-to-ethereum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/24f8823494f2cdfda6c41b0ecd00d4adddadd040-2157x1438.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42424110,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2knlh,1638822688,DeFi’s Decentralization Is an Illusion: BIS Quarterly Review,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) has a centralization problem and policy makers should use it to regulate the sector, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) said in its latest quarterly review.  The review, published Monday by the central banks’ liaison and coordination organization, examines developments in global non-bank financial intermediaries and offers policy perspectives. The review dedicated the first of its five special features to discussing DeFi and implications for financial stability.  DeFi seeks to improve the efficiency of financial transactions by replacing traditional middlemen like banks and exchanges with automated contracts built on blockchains. As of Dec. 3, DeFi is a $162 billion market, up 26% from April.  Although there is much debate about how a system without intermediaries can be regulated, according to the BIS report policymakers have a way in. DeFi has an “inescapable need” for centralized governance, the report says.  “The point raised in the special feature is that there’s a limit to how far you can run a whole financial system purely based on those automated transactions,” said Hyon Song Shin, economic adviser and head of research at BIS during a press briefing on Monday.  There will be occasions when DeFi projects will be in need of reorganization or judgment, Shin said. “I think it’s an open question how far this project can be pushed without that kind of centralized guidance. I think that’s something that we will clearly need to watch very carefully.”  According to the report, the tendency for blockchain consensus mechanisms to concentrate power also makes it easy for a small number of stakeholders to make big decisions.  “DeFi’s inherent governance structures are the natural entry points for public policy,” the report says.  Despite its fast growth, DeFi is “self-contained” and its potential for disrupting the larger financial system remains low, according to the review. If, however, DeFi were to become widespread, its “severe” vulnerabilities could undermine financial stability.  According to the 16-page feature, those vulnerabilities can arise from intermediary-free lending programs, or from liquidity issues in stablecoins – which are the asset-pegged cryptocurrencies that typically facilitate transactions in DeFi applications. Other vulnerabilities include interconnectedness among DeFi applications and a lack of banks to absorb potential shocks, the report says.  Decentralization illusion  “The decentralized nature of DeFi raises the question of how to implement any policy provisions,” the report says. “We argue that full decentralization in DeFi is an illusion.”  One element that could break this illusion is DeFi’s governance tokens, which are cryptocurrencies that represent voting power in decentralized systems, according to the report. Governance-token holders can influence a DeFi project by voting on proposals or changes to the governance system. These governing bodies are called decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and each one can oversee multiple DeFi projects.  “This element of centralization can serve as the basis for recognizing DeFi platforms as legal entities similar to corporations,” the report says. It gave an example of how DAOs can register as limited liability companies in the state of Wyoming.  “These groups, and the governance protocols on which their interactions are based, are the natural entry points for policymakers,” the report says.  During Monday’s briefing, Shin explained that there are three areas regulators could address through these centralized organizational bodies. These include consumer protection, guarding against money laundering and criminal activities, and financial stability – to what extent the DeFi ecosystem will overlap with the conventional financial system.  “Then there is the issue of how we think about these new institutions, these new arrangements as part of the financial market infrastructure,” Shin said.  The report adds that these entry points should allow public authorities to contain the risks associated with DeFi before the industry grows too large and becomes a threat to financial stability.  Vulnerabilities  Decision-making power on DeFi blockchains runs the risk of being concentrated in a small group of large investors, the report says, a possibility the DeFi community is increasingly discussing ways to overcome.  “Concentration can facilitate collusion and limit blockchain viability. It raises the risk that a small number of large validators can gain enough power to alter the blockchain for financial gain,” the report says.  Large validators could also congest the blockchain with artificial trades between their own wallets or risk insider trading, according to the report.  The report points out that lending through DeFi platforms is typically over-collateralized, meaning a potential loan is smaller than the value of assets used as collateral for it.  “But funds borrowed in one instance can be re-used to serve as collateral in other transactions, allowing investors to build increasingly large exposure for a given amount of collateral,” the report says.  This creates a cycle where leverage allows more assets to be purchased for the initial capital, the report said. When debt eventually needs to be reduced, investors are forced to shed these assets, putting downward pressure on prices.  The report also cautions on vulnerabilities of stablecoins, the currencies that facilitate transactions on DeFi platforms. Stablecoins like tether (USDT) “risk liquidity mismatches” because they are backed by commercial paper, which are “short-term securities with illiquid secondary markets.”  The review warns that stablecoins like DAI, which are backed by crypto assets, are “exposed to market risk, because the value of these assets can quickly drop below the face value of stablecoins.” The crypto arena doesn’t have a fallback like banks that can provide liquidity at times of stress, the report said.  DeFi’s distance from the traditional finance system is likely to narrow as participants in traditional markets look to expand into crypto. That raises the risk of spillovers, according to the report.  “This could potentially strengthen the links between the traditional and crypto systems,” the report says. U.S. approval of bitcoin futures-linked exchange-traded funds (ETF) this year is an example of this.  Given the rapid growth of this unregulated sector, the report signals policymakers to start making moves.  “Regulatory safeguards would also help to ensure that the innovative potential of DeFi brings overall benefits to finance,” the report says.

Decentraland (MANA), the top-ranking metaverse asset according to the cryptocurrency analysis firm Messari, is down 25% in the last seven days. MANA reached a market capitalization of $10 billion on Nov. 25 but now sits at $6.63 billion.  Read more: SAND, MANA Tokens Surged in November as Crypto Traders Bet on ‘Metaverse’ Potential  MANA’s drop is followed closely by AXS, one of the tokens in the leading play-to-earn game Axie Infinity, which is down 23% in the last seven days. The AXS market cap is currently $6.21 billion but reached a high of $9.77 billion on Nov. 7, according to CoinMarketCap.  “It is no surprise that gaming/metaverse tokens got hit the hardest after the recent hype,” said Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock. Outumuro said that these tokens are extremely speculative bets, which is evidenced by the high concentration of short-term traders.  He said this previously occurred with shiba inu (SHIB), the self-proclaimed “dogecoin killer,” which had a high concentration of short-term traders too – a strong indication of coins riding hype cycles.  Research from IntoTheBlock shows that metaverse tokens such as MANA have a high percentage of holders that bought within the past 30 days (32%), while such traders make up less than 10% for both BTC and ETH at the moment.  Outpacing broader sell-off  Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, is down 15% in the last seven days. Bitcoin experienced a crash on Saturday, which saw the price fall as low as $42,400 on some exchanges.  SAND, the native cryptocurrency of the blockchain-based virtual world The Sandbox, is down 25% in the last seven days, mirroring MANA’s dip over the same time span.  Read more: How Bitcoin Set Itself Up for This Sell-Off  Matthew Dibb, Stack Funds’ chief operating officer and co-founder, said that while the future of metaverse and gaming tokens looks bright, there is very little real adoption in the present.  “Most of the price appreciation was made up of future expected value rather than present valuation metrics,” said Dibb. “Adding fuel to the fire, there have been some large unlocks of early investors that have chosen to liquidate since the crash.”  Index Coop’s Metaverse Index, which tracks crypto assets and protocols building out virtual worlds, is down 8.7% on the day.",NEGATIVE,AXS | BTC | MANA | SHIB,AXS | BTC | MANA | MARKET | SHIB,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/06/why-metaverse-tokens-are-getting-hammered-in-cryptos-market-sell-off,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4dcbd5fc34fded91e9c59476a4ea8c803f90a4e0-720x406.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The FSA’s move mirrors similar proposals in the United States. In November, the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets, along with other regulators, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), released a report on stablecoins that included recommendations to treat stablecoin issuers like banks.  According to the report, the legislation will also include steps to prevent money laundering via stablecoins by giving the agency additional oversight over intermediaries such as wallet providers, and also adding additional know-your-customer (KYC) measures.

42424130,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2koHh,1638821650,3 Reasons the Ether-Bitcoin Ratio Rose to 3 1/2-Year High as Crypto Crashed,"While bitcoin tanked last week, pulling the broader crypto market lower, there was one bright spot. The ether-bitcoin (ETH/BTC) ratio rose 13%, reaching a 3 1/2-year high and registering its best weekly performance since May.  The move was unique. Historically the pair has rallied during market-wide bull runs characterized by buying frenzy in ETH and other alternative cryptocurrencies.  Several factors, including the Ethereum blockchain’s EIP-1559 upgrade implemented in August, appear to have helped ETH/BTC chalk out gains in a risk-off environment. Let us discuss each one.  Bitcoin exposure to macro risks  Increased institutional participation in bitcoin has perhaps made the biggest cryptocurrency more sensitive to adverse macro developments.  Bitcoin’s recovery from the Thanksgiving Day slide ran out of steam last week after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled growing discomfort with high inflation, stoking expectations of a faster unwinding of crisis-era stimulus.  Late Friday, the debt-ridden Chinese property giant Evergrande warned of possible cross-defaults on its dollar bonds, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) urged central banks to speed up monetary policy tightening.  Since inception, bitcoin has been widely touted as an inflation hedge like gold and has closely tracked inflation expectations over the past 18 months. The U.S. 10-year breakeven rate, which represents how the market foresees long-term price pressures, has eased to 2.43% from 2.76% in the past two weeks, while money markets have brought forward the timing of the first Fed rate hike to mid-2022.  So, it’s no surprise that bitcoin ended the week with a double-digit loss versus ether’s 2.3% drop.  EIP-1559 and ETH 2.0  According to analysts, ether’s newfound deflationary asset credentials and impending transition to the proof-of-stake mechanism, dubbed ETH 2.0, may have helped the cryptocurrency stay relatively resilient.  “One of bitcoin’s main value propositions over ETH has been its monetary policy. However, after the London upgrade (and specifically EIP-1559), many perceive ETH as having a sounder monetary policy,” Alex Svanevik, CEO of blockchain data company Nansen, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.  EIP 1559, the Ethereum Improvement Proposal implemented on Aug. 5, has brought deflationary asset appeal by introducing a mechanism to destroy, or burn, a portion of fees paid to miners. That puts ether’s monetary policy at odds with the Fed’s several years of continuous fiat money printing.  While bitcoin’s programmed code known as “reward halving” also reduces the pace of supply expansion by half every four years, EIP-1559 has tied the amount of ether burned to actual network usage. Ethereum, the world’s largest programmable blockchain, dominates decentralized finance (DeFi) and other booming crypto sub-sectors like gaming and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  Since activation, Ethereum’s blockchain has burned more than 1 million ether worth $4.4 billion, leading to a net supply reduction of 68%, according to data source Watch The Burn.  According to Svanevik the market is excited about the Ethereum mainnet’s “merge” with the beacon chain proof-of-stake system scheduled for next year. The merge will mark the end of the proof-of-work mechanism and the transition to proof-of-stake.  According to analytics firm IntoTheBlock’s Lucas Outumuro, ether issuance is expected to drop 90% following the merge as it will no longer be distributed to miners. Further, there is consensus that the merge will make Ethereum faster and more efficient.  Bitcoin’s declining role as a funding currency  Stablecoins have to a large extent taken over bitcoin’s role of being a base currency for other cryptocurrencies, Svanevik says.  In other words, stablecoins like tether with values pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar are now used to fund alternative cryptocurrency (altcoin) purchases. That’s a change compared with pre-2020, when bitcoin served as a gateway to altcoins. So, the unwinding of long altcoin trades now puts a bid under stablecoins. Previously, it would bring demand for bitcoin, helping the cryptocurrency outperform other coins.  What next?  While it may be too early to call ether the crypto market’s new haven, the token powering Ethereum’s blockchain may continue to outperform bitcoin as the focus remains on macroeconomic factors.  “We expect that cryptocurrencies will continue to be driven by the appetite for risk in other markets,” said Matthew Dibb, COO and co-founder of Stack Funds. “New COVID variant concerns, as well as tapering, have been a major concern here, and we see this being a predominant theme for the remainder of Q4.”  Technical charts indicate that the path of least resistance for the ETH/BTC ratio is higher.  “ETH/BTC has just broken out of the bull flag, a bullish continuation pattern,” MintingM, a Mumbai, India-based crypto asset management company, said.  “From a fundamental standpoint, Ethereum has DeFi, NFTs and metaverse going strong for itself while relatively Bitcoin only had the taproot upgrade. From a behavioral standpoint, NEW money has started to flow into ether from bitcoin,” MintingM added.  ETH/BTC was trading near 0.083 at press time, having put in a high of 0.085 on Saturday. Bitcoin was trading near $47,700 and ether around $3,970.  The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) said early today that it would cut banks’ reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points, releasing 1.2 trillion yuan ($188 billion) to boost slowing economic growth.

42394342,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvc8iv,1638820725,DAOs and the Next Crowdfunding Gold Rush,"The biggest crossover crypto story of the past few weeks is probably ConstitutionDAO – a ragtag group of crypto believers who raised more than $40 million in ETH to purchase an original copy of the U.S. constitution at auction.  Much has been made of the ways in which the group failed. They didn’t actually buy the constitution; their organizational structure spiraled into chaos; and they bungled the refund mechanism, leaving thousands of contributors in the lurch. But what they did accomplish is almost as staggering as the extent of their failures: ConstitutionDAO got tens of thousands of addresses to donate $40 million over the course of about a week, without a marketing team or dedicated growth director.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Some of that is owed to the broader phenomenon of meme-based populism – the same energy that galvanized Reddit’s day traders to pump GameStop stock in January. It’s the thrill of collective progress, with an ideological twist in the form of an identifiable enemy: “Banks are bad.”  But the massive raise is also a testament to the fast and furious nature of crypto itself. Kickstarter, one of the most recognized crowdfunding platforms, doesn’t actually take money out of your bank account until a project is fully funded. And in the U.S., Kickstarter operates through the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s legal carve-outs for regulated crowdfunds, which incorporate certain consumer protections – there’s all sorts of things a project can’t do. If a project runs off with your money, or doesn’t actually build what they plan to build, it can be held liable.  Not so with crypto crowdfunds, or at least not yet. With ConstitutionDAO, the strategy was to raise the money first and figure out the logistics after the fact. Donations came with zero guarantees beyond a set of tokens, apportioned pro rata according to what you put in.  That’s also the logic behind ConstitutionDAO’s copycats. Spice DAO (formerly known as Dune DAO), which now counts the musician Grimes among its members, raised $11 million for a copy of Alejandro Jodorowsky’s “Dune” storyboards. But it did so only after its initial failure to meet the requisite $4 million high bid for the manuscript – the new, multi-part raise was an attempt to reimburse the one group member who purchased the manuscript personally.  The major incentive is that if things don’t work out, you’ve still got your tokens, which could potentially be worth something on the secondary market. $PEOPLE, the token for ConstitutionDAO, has a market cap of $271 million on the strength of donations worth far less. It was trading at around $0.16 per token late last month. $SPICE tokens have so far had less success, but they’re certainly trading.  The whiplash nature of the crypto market is uniquely suited to these sorts of impulsive, communal gestures. It’s the logic of “aping in,” the frisson of excitement that comes from risking it all, with an added ideological component. And it doesn’t hurt that the hype around “Web 3.0″ – that increasingly nebulous buzzword – is a shiny hook for wealthy investors to latch onto.  See also: Money for Everything: A Future Where Every Inch of Culture Is Monetized  Of course, this isn’t really a new phenomenon. The crypto-backed publishing platform Mirror, which began as an alternative to Substack, has evolved into a tool for crowdfunding crypto projects through non-fungible tokens and token distribution models in the vein of ConstitutionDAO. Early adopters have used it to crowdfund art projects, essays, music collectives and other amorphous crypto-powered endeavorshttps://allforclimate.mirror.xyz/crowdfunds/0x9f25a5E6fC859d9b6dD23d17DE83Aaef9dEA8Ddf.  With all these projects, there’s an implicit sense that you’re not owed anything. It hinges on trust: Where donating to a Kickstarter is an expression of goodwill, putting money in a crypto crowdfund is like helping bootstrap an early-stage company.  The recent crowdfunding gold rush is playing off that gambler’s ethos. Sure, you might lose it all.

The liquidity crunch that China Evergrande (OTCPK:EGRNF) (OTCPK:EGRNY) is facing is also throwing some attention onto stablecoins&apos; stability. For example, Tether (USDT-USD), the stablecoin with the biggest market cap, is backed partly by commercial paper, a form of short-term corporate debt. The company said in September that it doesn&apos;t hold any commercial paper or other debt issued by Evergrande (OTCPK:EGRNF). Still, that points to the risk that such debt could pose to stablecoin holders. Other stablecoins include USDCoin (USDC-USD) and TrueUSD (TUSD-USD). Limiting stablecoin issuance to wire transfer companies an banks, which are legally required to protect customer assets, would be a way to limit the risk for coin users, according to the FSA.

13221816,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=478190,1638817220,Data Shows Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Have Started To Sell At A Loss,"On-chain data shows Bitcoin short-term holders are increasingly selling at a loss following the latest crash in the crypto&apos;s price. Bitcoin Short-Term Holder SOPR Dips Further Below One As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, on-chain data shows that the STH SOPR has decreased to July levels, suggesting that short-term holders are increasingly realizing their losses. The Spent Output Profit Ratio, or &apos;SOPR&apos; in short, is a Bitcoin indicator that tells us whether investors are selling at a loss or a profit during a given period. The metric&apos;s value is calculated by taking the ratio between the value of coins at spent time, and that at the time of creation. If the SOPR drops below one, then it means investors are, on an average, selling at a loss. While if it floats above the threshold, then the overall market is making a profit. It being exactly equal to one implies holders are breaking even. A slight modification of this indicator is the STH SOPR, which measures the profit ratio of only those coins that were held for less than 155 days before being sold. These coins are usually assumed to be the short-term holder (STH) supply. So, the STH SOPR highlights whether these holders were selling in profit or not at a specific time.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) published its Semiannual Risk Perspective report for the fall of 2021, outlining what the agency sees as the key and emerging risks banks should be aware of. Digital assets have been in the report before, but the Fall 2021 report has the most in-depth analysis of how digital assets might interact with the banking sector.  “Distributed ledger technology and digital assets, including stablecoins and other crypto assets, may broaden delivery channels and the functionality of financial services,” the report says. “The OCC is approaching crypto-related activities in the federal banking system very carefully with a high degree of caution and expects its supervised institutions to do the same.”  Banks and other regulated institutions should check with their OCC supervisor before they begin offering any services in the digital asset sector, the report says.  These services can include custody, derivatives products and access to third-party crypto products.  “This includes ensuring sufficient knowledge and expertise in the underlying products and services and processes to identify and address strategic, operational, compliance and reputational risks. Sound risk management of crypto-related product offerings includes alignment with a bank’s strategic goals, risk appetite, resources and expertise,” the report says.  While the report says digital assets can lead to “opportunities” for the banking sector, it emphasizes there are risks to banks if they delve into this new asset class.  The OCC intends to provide more guidance for banks in the coming year as well, outlining how specifically banks can take up crypto offerings.  The report points to recent publications by groups the OCC was part of, including the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets’ report on stablecoins and the joint interagency sprint team that included the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.

42396395,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT38py,1638809540,"Crypto Mining Stocks Extend Declines as Bitcoin, Ether Prices Fall","Crypto mining stocks, which are most levered to bitcoin and ether prices as most have been holding onto the mined coins on their balance sheets, on Monday continued their slump that started in the beginning of the month.  Bitcoin prices have fallen almost 17% since reaching $58,000 on Dec. 1, after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled growing discomfort with high inflation, stoking expectations of a faster unwinding of crisis-era stimulus.  On Monday, large-cap miners Marathon Digital (MARA) and Riot Blockchain (RIOT) both fell more than 5% early in the day, although Marathon eventually recovered most of those losses. The shares of other miners such as Argo Blockchain (ARBK), Hut 8 (HUT), Hive Blockchain (HIVE) and Cipher Mining (CIFR) were down 9%, 3%, 6% and 12% respectively.  “In our view, with the market gripped by Omicron fears at a time when valuations are inflated, the selling pressure could easily continue,” said Wall Street investment banking firm DA Davidson’s analyst Chris Brendler, who remains bullish on bitcoin given its “strong underlying fundamentals especially against the prospects for a sustained pandemic.”  However, he sees “a materially better” buying opportunity in mining stocks than bitcoin itself as there should be more upside for the miners when bitcoin recovers. He also noted that the pullback in bitcoin should help slow the hashrate recovery while the miners are still “super profitable” with the price of bitcoin near $50,000.  Meanwhile, bitcoin miner Greenidge Generation (GREE) was the only outperformer among mining stocks on Monday, rising about 9% in a bounce back following its sharp decline last week after U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren expressed concern about the miner’s environmental footprint.  Other crypto-linked stocks such as MicroStrategy, which buys and holds bitcoin on its balance sheet, also fell 6%.

Such an impressive growth can only mean one thing—a rise in decentralized exchanges as well. With centralized exchanges proving a little complicated and problematic at times, the crypto space will agree that decentralized exchanges are the future of cryptocurrency trading on Layer 1 Ethereum. While these decentralized solutions are great and have caused a rise in DeFi activities, users have had to contend with paying miners higher transaction/gas fees. But these solutions don&apos;t have to be expensive and there are some great exchanges keeping things economical. Here are some of the cheapest DEXes to trade on layer 1 Ethereum. #1. Balancer Balancer launched in 2020 as an Automated Market Maker allowing DEXes to function more efficiently in the DeFi space. One of Balancer&apos;s aims has been reducing gas fees for traders on Ethereum and making liquidity pools relatively gas-efficient for new smart contracts. The protocol has set out to make loads of features solid but streamlined. Balancer has recently integrated with blockchain network Gnosis, creating the Balancer-Gnosis protocol (BGP). Their joint work culminated with the launch of CowSwap DEX, which has users needing only to pay a fraction of the gas fees other traders pay to use other DEXes.

The index will “sit alongside” the FTSE 100 and Russell 2000, said Kristen Mierzwa, the head of exchange-traded fund (ETF) strategy and business development for the FTSE Russell.  FTSE Russell is a subsidiary of the London Stock Exchange that produces market indices.  “Right now we’ve got 43 assets which have made their way through the vetting process,” Mierzwa said. “This was clearly becoming a market that people wanted data around.”  The index will be U.K. and EU compliant, and its vetting process would screen out the vast majority of the 11,000 known cryptos. Stablecoins and even meme-based coins, such as dogecoin, could be added, Mierzwa confirmed.  The news represents a welcomed endorsement for cryptocurrencies from the U.K.’s mainstream financial world that is often more conservative in its messaging.

The oversubscribed funding round also included the venture capital arm of Fidelity International, DRW Venture Capital, Alumni Ventures and Jump Capital.  Using the Stacked platform, customers can access pre-built bundles of investments from hedge funds, indices and asset managers and get investment advice based on their financial goals. Stacked is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate as a registered investment adviser (RIA).  “There’s a ton of really cool tools out there that you can do across all kinds of neat platforms. But the reality is that 95% of that stuff, including just the basic crypto exchanges, is still too complicated for the average person. Because while they make buying crypto easy, there’s still the elephant in the room of, ‘Well, what crypto do I buy?’,” Stacked founder and CEO Joel Birch told CoinDesk in an interview.  Launched in 2020, Stacked said it now has over $100 million in user funds connected to its smart portfolio manager. Its goal is to grow assets under management to over $1 billion in 2022. Stacked is currently web-based but plans to go fully mobile within the next six months.  About a third of the funding round will go toward growing the firm’s headcount to over 100 with a particular focus on the strategic leadership side, said Birch.  “But then we also intend on doing a large user acquisition play. We’re going to allocate a lot of dollars towards marketing. And we’re also going to be making some heavy investments in the blockchain technology side,” said Birch.  Investment products that make it easier to invest in crypto are on the rise. In August, mobile investment platform Titan launched an actively managed crypto investment basket containing several cryptocurrencies.

CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao told the Sunday Telegraph that relations have improved since its ban in June.  “We’re making a number of very substantial changes in organizational structures, product offerings, our internal processes and the way we work with regulators,” Zhao said. “We want to continue to establish a presence in the U.K. and serve U.K. users in a fully licensed and fully compliant manner.”  One option is to set up a U.K. company similar to Binance.US. This could address FCA concerns pertaining to Binance’s opaque structure, such as not having an established headquarters to which concerns can be addressed.  The FCA said in June that no entity in the Binance group “holds any form of U.K. authorization, registration or license to conduct regulated activity in the U.K,” adding that the exchange was “not capable of being effectively supervised.”  The notice was one of the first of several warnings from similar bodies around the world, which prompted Binance to take a more proactive strategy on regulatory matters.  Zhao told the Sunday Telegraph that Binance has since set up an office in Britain, manned by a “number of ex-regulatory staff from the U.K. and a couple of hundred compliance people.”  Read more: Binance US to Close Pre-IPO Funding in 1-2 Months",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | BNB,Jamie Crawley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/12/06/binance-hires-in-uk-plans-to-seek-fca-approval-for-launch-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/03d1feaf86a90aa9571eedfc9dc4a9289aba3108-1500x954.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The initial version of ChainSwap Cross-chain Bridge Aggregator integrates three leading bridge solutions, namely Poly Bridge, Multichain, and AnySwap. More bridges are expected to be supported by the aggregator. ChainSwap&apos;s final goal is to integrate all cross-chain bridges available on the market and become the go-to platform for cross-chain solution seekers. Why a Bridge Aggregator: Current Challenges Imagine that you want to transfer a token from ETH to BSC with a decentralized cross-chain bridge. Currently, there are a few challenges. First, you need to research which bridge supports the token on both chains. Second, you need to choose which bridge provides the best deal with the lowest slippage and transaction fee, on top of other information such as estimated bridge duration time. In order to do that, you have to spend time comparing all the currently offered bridge solutions. This is difficult and time-consuming as the currently offered bridge solutions do not have a common interface, this is where the Chainswap bridge aggregator comes in. Market Analysis According to Dune Analytics, the current combined TVL of Ethereum bridges is $26.65 billion as of Dec. 1, 2021, up by +100% from only 2 months ago. This data tracks the 17 leading Ethereum bridges and is demonstrating an ever-growing trend.

It aims to solve the scalability problems associated with the Ethereum network, which has suffered from congestion and high fees.

Bitcoin plunged all the way down to $44,000 on Saturday, off 17% on the session, triggering a rout in other cryptocurrencies like Ether (ETH-USD), Solana (SOL-USD), Dogecoin (DOGE-UD) and Shiba Inu (SHIB-USD). In fact, the overall crypto sector shed around a fifth of its value, sliding to $2.2T, according to tracker CoinGecko. What happened? Many attributed the crash to speculation around crypto in general - particularly as it relates to NFTs - which had reached levels that make late-1999 look tame (to paraphrase Charlie Munger). When selling picks up, the momentum names which have benefited most from inflows turn into overcrowded positions as investors rush for the exits. The same kind of sentiment has hit other speculative corners of the market like meme stocks, IPOs and SPACs.

BitMart has completed an initial security check and identified affected assets, and it plans to compensate users out of its own pocket, Xia said.  The exchange will announce a timetable to gradually continue deposits and withdrawals, he said, adding that he is “confident” they will resume on Dec. 7.  The hackers used decentralized exchange aggregator 1inch to swap stolen tokens for ether, and deposited ether funds to privacy mixer Tornado Cash to hide their identities, PeckShield said.
