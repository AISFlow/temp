42397343,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapfOy,1388246844,Arisebitcoin is Putting Up 40 Bitcoin Billboards in the San Francisco Bay Area,"Many denizens of San Francisco like to claim that their charming city tends to be ahead of the curve when it comes to arts, social issues and technology. More often than not they are right. Therefore it is hardly surprising that Arisebitcoin chose to kick off its first bitcoin awareness campaign in San Francisco.  Dubbed “Hello San Francisco, Hello Bitcoin,” the project aims to bring bitcoin closer to the masses. It is a self-funded project designed to introduce users in the San Francisco bay area to bitcoin and provide them with the necessary resources to get started. The organisation says it is the first effort to gain the community’s trust and that it is only the beginning.  Arisebitcoin is planning to put up 40 billboards across the bay area, from South San Jose to San Pablo and everywhere in between. Measuring 10 x 22 feet across, the orange billboards will not go unnoticed and the team believes they can put up all 40 posters over the next five days. The campaign officially started 27th December and it is scheduled to end on 27th January.  Arisebitcoin said:  “We live by the motto go big or go home and look forward to proving this to not only the current bitcoin community, but to the world. We thoroughly believe in change and the freedom bitcoin allows. The members of arisebitcoin.com are united by this cause. To accomplish this large but obtainable task, we have determined a set of guidelines and projects in hopes of creating a snowball marketing effect on the world.“  The ultimate goal of the campaign, and Arisebitcoin itself for that matter, is to introduce new users to bitcoin. By attracting and educating new users the organisation hopes to accelerate the awareness and use of bitcoin.  “Arisebitcoin considers every new user who visits our site due to our 'projects' a success. With the support of existing and new users, we will continue to promote bitcoin beyond anything attempted thus far,” the organisation said.  According to a recent Bloomberg poll, 42% of Americans know that bitcoin is a digital currency, but quite a few of them still harbour misconceptions about the nature of bitcoin and its potential uses.  However, 46% said they do not know what bitcoin is, while 6% believed it is an iPhone app. The poll also revealed that people under the age of 35 were a lot more knowledgeable about bitcoin and more likely to favour keeping it unregulated.

42397332,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapfE9,1388232550,Goldman Sachs Director to Join Board of Bitcoin Startup Circle,"Goldman Sachs board member M. Michele Burns is joining the board of new bitcoin payment processor Circle Internet Financial, becoming the latest representative from the worlds of big finance and investing to show an interest in digital currency.  The move represents a possible greater acceptance of bitcoin in the US in the financial mainstream, at a time when other large countries are attempting to block or caution against its use.  Burns is also a Director at Cisco Systems Inc., and previously sat on the board at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Her involvement in the finance industry goes back to 1981, and she has also been Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of insurance brokerage Marsh & McLennan, and Chairman and CEO of consultancy firm Mercer.  She has also supported Democratic politicians Al Gore and Hillary Clinton, sits on the Boards of Trustees at the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and the Elton John AIDS Foundation, and is a Strategic Advisor at the Stanford Center on Longevity.  Circle has been a favorite with big investors since its launch last October, making headlines with the largest ever Series A investment in a bitcoin company of $9m from well-known tech investors such as Jim Breyer, Accel Partners and General Catalyst Partners.  Part of the appeal is Circle's CEO Jeremy Allaire, previously CEO of online video platform Brightcove and Allaire Corporation, creator of the ColdFusion development language before its acquisition by Macromedia in 2001.  He has described bitcoin as ""a totally transformational technology"" that could be as significant as email or Skype. Circle aims to be a business and regulator-friendly payment processor similar to BitPay and Coinbase, but has not fully unveiled its services as yet.  Allaire also fronted the US Senate Committee hearings on bitcoin in November, saying bitcoin had to live with the realities of a regulatory environment, but also suggesting the regulatory burden on financial services was too high when compared to other startups in the tech sector.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/12/28/goldman-sachs-director-to-join-board-of-bitcoin-startup-circle,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9664d28998bd7ec6f94e4930f406b8f417279deb-1001x700.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397344,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapfPx,1388214325,5 Security Tips for Bitcoin Beginners,"Bitcoin makes moving money across the internet incredibly easy, but that ease comes with risks.  There are plenty of ways someone can take your money, track your spending, or violate your privacy.  Fortunately, there are also some straightforward measures you can take to safeguard your digital currency and keep your spending habits private. Here are our top five tips to protect your bitcoins:  1. Keep separate wallets  If the wallet you use for spending bitcoin also contains your entire bitcoin holdings, your savings will be vulnerable to various types of abuse.  There is no limit to the number of bitcoin addresses (or wallets) that one person may have.  Therefore, you could easily have an address for spending money, an address for savings and even an address for receiving payments.  2. Don't keep your savings in a web wallet  Recently, there have been several cases of web wallets being hacked and subsequently emptied.  While web wallets are convenient, they should only be used like a checking/current account – as a place to store money you will be using in the near future. Thus, if you only keep a small amount of spending money in a wallet that gets hacked, your losses will be limited.  Remember, bitcoin does not work like a credit card. If you lose money fraudulently, that money is gone and there is nobody you can send a refund claim to. You can always contact the police, but it's unlikely they'll be able to get your bitcoins back.  3. Protect your privacy  Above anything else, remember – never share your private keys with anyone else. If your wallet address (ie your public key) is the equivalent of your bank account number, then your private wallet key is your PIN.  Thanks to taint analysis, it's possible to work out which bitcoin wallets are likely to be owned by the same person because of their transaction history.  If you have a 'spending' wallet and a 'savings' wallet, regular transactions between the two will provide a pretty clear signal to hackers which one is the address of your savings wallet.  Illegal activities aside, there is a legitimate reason to obscure that relationship, as it could allow someone to investigate how many bitcoins you have, which is something that should remain private. Would you reveal all of your financial details to a stranger?  The best way to obscure the relationship between your wallets is to transfer funds between them via a mixing service.  4. Cold Storage  Even if you keep your bitcoins in a wallet stored on your computer, you're still vulnerable to an attack. Bitcoin wallet applications save their data in a predictable location, thus they are particularly vulnerable to Trojan horse attacks.  Such attacks have been reported by bitcoin users. A common solution is to keep your wallet's private key stored in an offline medium as an added layer of protection. This offline medium could simply be a QR code printed on a piece of paper or a plain text file stored on a USB key.  If you want to transfer bitcoins from an offline wallet to someone/somewhere else, you would first need to scan the QR code or enter the wallet's private key manually into an application like Blockchain. Once the application has displayed the balance of your wallet, you will be able to transfer bitcoins to the wallet address of your choice.  As an added measure, you could encrypt your private keys so that if they were discovered, they'd be useless without your encryption password – just don't forget your password!    5. Backup!  While the other tips on this list have been about protecting your bitcoin fortune from other people, this one is all about protecting against yourself.  Assuming you are using a desktop client to store your bitcoin wallets, there should be an option to back up your wallet(s). Again, instructions will vary depending on your client.  By using such features, the public and private key to your wallet will be saved into a file. That's all any bitcoin wallet needs to retrieve your balance, as the actual value attached to your bitcoin addresses are stored as data on the block chain, not on your wallet application.  Once you have a file containing your wallet keys, you can put this anywhere: flash drive, optical disk, portable hard drive, on paper, etc.  You can even store these files on a cloud-based backup system like Dropbox, which offers robust data reliability. However, given that no cloud system is 100% safe, it would be wise to encrypt such data before uploading, Truecrypt is one such tool that can encrypt your wallet files.  One more thing...  Another example of a secure cold storage wallet is something called a 'brain wallet'. This is essentially a secret combination of words and numbers you carry around in your head. When you enter your passphrase into a site like brainwallet, it will unscramble it so you can obtain your private key. For more information read our brain wallet guide.
