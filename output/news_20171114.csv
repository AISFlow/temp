42400642,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKJD0,1510697713,UK Finance Regulator Warns Against Cryptocurrency Derivatives,"A U.K. finance regulator is warning consumers about a particular kind of derivative contract based on cryptocurrencies.  In a release on its website today, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) cautioned investors who might consider entering into cryptocurrency contracts-for-differences or CFDs. Under a CFD, the two parties involved agree to pay either side in the event that the underlying value of an asset – in this case, an amount of cryptocurrency – changes over time.  These products allow users to speculate on the prices of different assets, and while cryptocurrencies fall under this umbrella, they ought to be considered high-risk, according to the agency.  CFDs fall under the purview of the FCA, meaning that companies offering such products are within the agency's jurisdiction. Legal safeguards aside, the agency warned that ""these protections will not compensate you for any losses from trading.""  The agency said:  ""Cryptocurrency CFDs are an extremely high-risk, speculative investment. You should be aware of the risks involved and fully consider whether investing in cryptocurrency CFDs is appropriate for you.""  The FCA listed price volatility, leverage, charges and funding costs, and price transparency as four risks to investing in crypto-based CFDs. The agency also noted that the initial fees required to invest in a crypto-based CFD are higher than for other contracts, and due to the volatility in cryptocurrency pricing, an investor could end up putting in more than the product they receive is worth.  Today's release isn't the first time the FCA has called for calm around investments related to cryptocurrencies. Back in June, FCA director of strategy and competition Chris Woolard said that ""we do have to exercise a degree of caution"" on the matter.  Then in September, the FCA said that initial coin offerings (ICOs) are ""very risky"" and advised would-be contributors to report any potential fraud they may encounter.

42400651,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKJKs,1510687232,Morgan Stanley Predicts 2018 Plunge in GPU Mining Sales,"An analyst for Morgan Stanley is predicting that the sale of graphics cards (GPUs) for cryptocurrency mining will fall next year, signifying a potential hurdle for sellers like AMD.  Joseph Moore, according to coverage from Barron's and Benzinga, suggested in a new report published this week that a mixture of network upgrades – including a decline in the overall block reward on the ethereum network from 5 ETH to 3 ETH – would have a tangible impact on miners, who engage in an energy-intensive process to create new transaction blocks.  As a result, according to Morgan Stanley, companies such as AMD could see their mining-related sales plunge by as much as 50% next year.  Moore wrote:  ""We believe that total graphics sales for ethereum mining in 2017 will be $800 [million] or so, and will decline by 50% in 2018; we can validate the 2017 number by looking at the increased complexity of the algorithm. Unless ethereum prices rally, downside variance to our 2018 forecast is more likely than upside.""  The Morgan Stanley analyst first wrote about AMD's potential graphics card sales issues two weeks ago, downgrading its rating from ""equal-weight"" to ""underweight."" He argued that while the company had gained some added profits due to the cryptocurrency mining community, this revenue would not last.  In his analysis, he wrote that ""we expect cryptocurrency [mining] to gradually fade from here,"" noting that he expects video game consoles and graphics demands in general to decline in 2018 as well.  AMD saw its revenue grow 19 percent due to the popularity of its latest graphics cards, according to a previous CoinDesk article. Competitor Nvidia also saw a significant revenue boost thanks to GPU buyers who are using them to mine cryptocurrencies.

Bricker revealed that his office is investigating ""cryptocurrencies, coins, tokens and so forth,"" as well as the ways in which they are exchanged and traded.  Indeed, he noted that his team is ""journeying with a compass"" by researching applications of the tech through the lens of the SEC's accounting and auditing requirements. And according to Bricker, accountants in the private sector may want to do the same.  He was quoted as saying:  ""I suggest that it is warranted for the accounting profession to also invest time in understanding these areas. I have not heard particularly good rationales for turning off – or never turning on – the profession’s lamps at this time.""  Bricker's comments come months after he, in another address, said that both ICO organizers as well as those who contribute need to be mindful of relevant reporting requirements.  ""An entity involved in initial coin or token offering activities will need to consider the necessary accounting, disclosure and reporting guidance based on the nature of its involvement,"" he said at the time.

Bitcoin Gold was largely shunned by the cryptocurrency community as a whole. As Bitcoin Gold is not directly affiliated with the original Bitcoin blockchain, the community felt that BTG was lacking the technical robustness that they have come to expect. Since that rocky start, however, the currency is now mineable. However, prices are yet to show the significant support from the community that Bitcoin would have been hoping for.Over the weekend, the currency showed a major downturn, but prices tracked by Coinmarketcap did start to show a slight uptick by early Monday morning. The price of Bitcoin Gold had peaked on the 11th November at just under $500 per coin, which coincided with the all-time high of Bitcoin Cash at just under $2,400.Come the end of the weekend and Monday morning, however, and both of Bitcoin’s major forks had taken a knock.

Bitcoin Gold was largely shunned by the cryptocurrency community as a whole. As Bitcoin Gold is not directly affiliated with the original Bitcoin blockchain, the community felt that BTG was lacking the technical robustness that they have come to expect. Since that rocky start, however, the currency is now mineable. However, prices are yet to show the significant support from the community that Bitcoin would have been hoping for.Over the weekend, the currency showed a major downturn, but prices tracked by Coinmarketcap did start to show a slight uptick by early Monday morning. The price of Bitcoin Gold had peaked on the 11th November at just under $500 per coin, which coincided with the all-time high of Bitcoin Cash at just under $2,400.Come the end of the weekend and Monday morning, however, and both of Bitcoin’s major forks had taken a knock.

42400644,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKJEy,1510678855,Russian Central Bank Official: ICOs Have 'Huge Potential',"A senior official at Russia's central bank said earlier today that he believes initial coin offerings (ICOs) could drive funding opportunities for startups.  According to the state-owned news service TASS, Bank of Russia first deputy chairman Sergei Shvetsov said that the central bank would ""support the development"" of the blockchain funding model. It's a notable development, given that the Bank of Russia – which doesn't serve as a financial regulator in the country – had published an investor warning about cryptocurrencies and ICOs back in September.  Shvetsov was quoted as saying:  ""Our country has a tremendous potential of innovations, our students, young people and entrepreneurs have the edge over any country in the world from the viewpoint of ideas, and amid the lack of classical institutions of startups support, ICO development has a huge potential to finance those ideas.""  What that aid will entail exactly remains to be seen. In subsequent comments, however, Shvetsov suggested that the blockchain use case could come to be viewed as a legitimate financial activity within Russia.  ""Hopefully, ICO[s] will take a rightful place on Russia’s financial market,"" the first deputy chairman reportedly said.  Shvetsov's remarks come weeks after Russian president Vladimir Putin issued several official orders related to cryptocurrencies, including one that mandated the creation of new rules around ICOs. Whether that work will dovetail with subsequent steps from the Russian central bank is unclear at this time.

42400659,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKJSk,1510674316,Bitcoin Cash's New Combo: Bull Exhaustion With Limited Downside?,"Bitcoin cash is buoyant again today, but some hints of bull exhaustion are starting to show.  At press time, the bitcoin cash-U.S. dollar (BCH/USD) exchange rate is $1,340. As per data from CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency has gained over 9 percent in the last 24 hours.  The gains come after record highs near $2,500 last week, reportedly due to a flow of money out of bitcoin (BTC) and into alternative protocols following the suspension of a controversial plan to alter the bitcoin's code. However, overbought technical conditions pushed prices back to $1,000 yesterday.  Still, dust now cleared, yesterday's pullback looks like nothing more than a normal technical correction, given that trading volumes dropped by 42 percent.  Despite the ups and downs, though, the cryptocurrency regained bid tone today, possibly on speculation that a successful outcome for a just-implemented hard fork of BCH may boost the protocol's appeal as a payment network. Also, a detailed look at the individual markets reveals the rally has been fuelled by Korean exchanges offering BCH/KRW pairs.  That said, the price action analysis indicates some bull market exhaustion, and the downside, if any, is likely to be capped at around $1,000 levels.  Daily chart  Yesterday's doji candle signals bull market exhaustion. An end of the day close below $1,000 would confirm a bearish doji reversal and open the doors for a pullback to $700 levels. The RSI is overbought as well.  As a result, a correction looks more likely, but the upward sloping 5-day MA and 10-day MA indicate any dips below $1,000 are likely to be short-lived.  1-hour chart  Bullish scenario: a rebound from the rising trend line followed by a break above $1,549 would add credence to the basing pattern on the RSI and hint at a climb to $2,000 levels.  View  The base appears to have shifted higher to $1,000 levels.  A short-term correction is likely, though dips below $1,000 are unlikely to last long.

Rumors spread in the past day – based on a circulated document – indicating that the country's State Grid was moving to ban bitcoin mining at a county level in Sichuan province, an ostensibly notable development given the area's abundant water supply for electricity generation and the fact that profit-chasing bitcoin miners are headquartered in the region.  A translated version of the document states that ""bitcoin mining is an illegal activity,"" further adding that ""each State Grid connected generator that is involved in powering bitcoin mining is also regarded as an illegal practice, which shall be prohibited."" The document includes the official stamp of the State Grid's Dan Ba county branch, located in Sichuan.  Though quickly circulated and reported by Chinese local media – raising questions about whether such a decision may signal an administration move against bitcoin mining (one that would follow crackdowns on initial coin offerings (ICOs) and the exchange-based trading of cryptocurrencies against the Chinese yuan) – subsequent statements indicate that the fears may be overblown.  According to Chinese business publication Caixin, local executives from the county branch confirmed the authenticity of the report but clarified it's only an internal memo and some of the phrases were drafted incorrectly. It's also important to note that the document comes from a county branch instead of a statewide level, thus diminishing the weight it might carry.  ""We are a state-owned enterprise, not an administrative branch that has the power to determine whether bitcoin mining is legitimate or not,"" the county branch told the publication.  The firm went on to clarify that some of the small generators in the region may have violated agreements that prioritize electrical supplies for local residents before business such as bitcoin mines.  At the same time, such a decision may also signal a conflict between the State Grid’s county branch and the individual generators over the profits that they make through bitcoin mining.  “It’s a fight for the interests of hydropower stations,” Jiang Zhuoer, founder of China’s mining pool BTC.TOP, told CoinDesk.

42400657,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKJPn,1510666230,I'm Really Into Blockchain. I Blockchain Everything!,"Michael J. Casey is chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor of blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.  In this opinion piece, part of a weekly series of columns, Casey grapples with the inconsistencies of language in the world of blockchains and cryptocurrencies and tries to find a way to live with it all.  You can measure how long someone has been into cryptocurrencies by how they use the word ""blockchain.""  My initiation came in the fall of 2013, when there was only one cryptocurrency worth talking about, which meant there was really only one blockchain. So, for me, the word had to come with the definite article: the blockchain.  This was about a year and a half before ""blockchain"" became a generic reference carrying an indefinite article – a blockchain – and two years before it morphed into an uncountable noun: ""blockchain"" as a concept. (Imagine someone saying ""I'm interested in ledger"" and you'll understand why this drives some of us nuts. A blockchain is a tangible thing, not a practice, a process or a field of interest.)  But thinking about the etymology of these words is more than just an academic exercise. It helps us understand the motives and interests that fuel subtle but important changes in meaning. For example, recognizing that detaching the word ""bitcoin"" from ""blockchain"" works to neuter the former helps us see how those most threatened by cryptocurrency are trying to shape the debate.  By the same token (no pun intended), if you don't understand why ""blockchain,"" expressed as an uncountable noun, means something different from ""a blockchain"" or ""the [bitcoin] blockchain,"" you could fall into a trap. It means you probably don't understand the technology you're dealing with and that someone could take advantage of you.  So, when Christian Smith, a colleague from the MIT Media Lab, gave an impassioned speech last week condemning the widespread use of ""the blockchain,"" it irked me. Not only did he dis the definite-article form on which I'd cut my cryptocurrency teeth, he happily used the uncountable noun form. To be fair, he was speaking at the MIT Legal Forum on AI & Blockchain. Perhaps I have to accept this increasingly ubiquitous usage as an unavoidable fact of life? Like taxes.  Still, Smith raised some good points. He rightly observed that there is now a plethora of distributed ledgers carrying the label ""blockchain,"" and thus that there is no monolithic single chain to which we all must adhere. And I fully share the disdain he expressed for that aggravating phrase, ""just hash it and put it on the blockchain.""  But to banish the definite article seemed to me to deny the word's roots.  I tend to view ""the blockchain"" as a nod to bitcoin's catalytic role in fostering wider interest in ""blockchain technology."" (Pro tip: if you want to talk about ""blockchain"" as a field of interest, use it as a modifier to a word like ""technology""; it can also modify other words, like ""pedant."") We still say ""the wheel"" to talk about other the starting point of that world-changing invention, don't we?  Origin of 'blockchain'  Hardcore bitcoin enthusiasts, those who have been in the space from the beginning, sometimes scoff at the newfound ubiquity of the word ""blockchain.""  Back in the day, no one really thought of the blockchain as being especially significant, other than that it described the particular transaction recording system that bitcoin used, one that happened to be arranged into a cryptographically linked chain of blocks.  ""Blockchain"" didn’t appear inSatoshi Nakamoto's initial white paper. It has been suggested the first usage came from Satoshi's early collaborator, Hal Finney, and even then in a less iconic, two-word construction – ""block chain"" – which Satoshi and others later picked up and used.  Once blockchain explorers were created, allowing people to more easily search the ledger, the single word started to gain significance. No doubt, its growing popularity was helped by the fact that the most popular of those software tools belonged to the startup named Blockchain – typically expressed with its URL extension "".info"" to distinguish it from the bitcoin ledger. (One mark of the confusion around all this is now found in how Blockchain.info's original logo is frequently used in slide decks by speakers seeking to illustrate a generic technology they call ""blockchain."")  Dedicated bitcoin developers still don't really talk about the blockchain as an isolated thing of any great importance. They view bitcoin as an all-encompassing technology, within which the chain-of-blocks ledger is just one part.  I personally think the blockchain deserves to be recognized on its own. It's what gives bitcoin its immutable time-stamping capacity, allowing tricks likeJulian Assange's ""proof of life"" and it lets us forecast when each halving will occur.  It also encapsulates the principle of the ""longest chain"" – contested as it may be – and, when the community is divided over a contentious hard fork proposal, as it was until recently, it's the blockchain that literally manifests that division. Still, core devs have a point: it's not entirely accurate to describe the blockchain, as many do, as the ""technology underpinning bitcoin.""  Things got confusing when Wall Street banks got interested in distributed ledgers.  They used the phrase ""blockchain without bitcoin,"" which misleadingly suggested that blockchains were not only important but more important than cryptocurrencies – even though, without the latter, it was impossible to have the groundbreaking permissionless, fully censorship-resistant, record of transactions that bitcoin introduced.  This new usage had a purpose, of course. It allowed the newcomers in suits to strip the technology of its most disruptive characteristic – the fact that no one could control it – and impose their own control over it. It was a subtle but powerful act of appropriation.  What to do about it  Should we care about this? Well, yes, and no.  As anyone with teenagers knows, language, especially English, is always evolving. And it needs to. Language imposes rules on social interaction. It constrains what we can and can't do with expression. This helps us make sense of each other, but if the rules are overly inflexible, they limit our imagination and our capacity for innovation.  There is a cultural zeitgeist underway in the ""blockchain space,"" a Cambrian explosion of ideas. We can do our part to try to steer the evolution of the language associated with that, but preventing change and new forms of expression is as difficult as stopping biological evolution.  What we must demand is awareness of why we use the words we use and why others choose theirs. (I'll begrudgingly accept ""blockchain"" as an uncountable noun if others will understand why my co-author Paul Vigna and I put ""The Blockchain"" into the title of our new book to acknowledge the technology's bitcoin-rooted history.)  With awareness hopefully comes consistency of usage. That's vital if we are to develop this technology and its applications. We need precision in communication if we are to come together and collaborate on the same ideas.  If we are at least thinking, reading and educating ourselves about such matters, we can be more accepting of the fluidity of word usages. That way, we avoid the harmful, confining effects of political correctness for blockchain. (See what I just did there.)  I only have one demand: don't, whatever you do, start using ""blockchain"" as a verb.  Pom pom image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET | FORKS,Michael J.

42400656,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKJQm,1510663512,Bottom in Place? Bitcoin's Price Needs to Consolidate,"Bitcoin's price is holding its ground so far today.  As of writing, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is changing hands for $6,495, as per the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. According to CoinMarketCap, the bitcoin-U.S. dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate has dropped by 1.74 percent in the last 24 hours.  Still, the small decrease hides the fact that BTC retraced more than 50 percent of its recent sell-off yesterday. In the time since, the downside has been capped around $6,400, while a ceiling has formed around $6,800.  So is the short-term bottom in place?  Monday's sharp recovery and the overnight resilience suggests that the rumored rotation of money out of bitcoin and into bitcoin cash and other alternative currencies may have largely come to a halt. However, it seems the market is still pricing in the recent suspension of the Segwit2x hard fork and and redetermining the value of competing protocols.  Further, the price action analysis indicates the bears need to push bitcoin below the 5-day moving average by today's close to avoid losing control.  Bitcoin chart  The above chart shows:  Despite the sharp recovery from near $5,500 levels, the chart still favors the bears, given the descending 5-day moving average (MA) and 10-day MA.  The relative strength index (RSI) may have moved above 50.00 (bullish territory), but lacks directional strength.  However, BTC moved back above the ascending trend line (drawn from the Sep. 15 low and Oct. 10 low) yesterday and is holding the trendline today. This is a cause of concern for the bears.  View  The longer prices stay above the trendline, the lower will be the odds of history repeating itself, (i.e. prices resuming sell-off and eventually finding a bottom around $5,000). A fresh rally towards record highs could be seen if prices hold above the rising trend line till the weekend.  A bearish move is likely to gather pace during the week ahead if prices close today below the 5-day MA (currently at $6,392).  A move above the 10-day MA is likely to be short-lived, given the descending nature of the moving average.  4-hour chart  Boat at anchor image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BCH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | FORKS,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2017/11/14/bottom-in-place-bitcoins-price-needs-to-consolidate,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b1cf9ae0c0ff8c921ad940e4fc1d63f56d65f965-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Maya Horowitz, threat intelligence group manager at Check Point, said in a press release that the emergence of mining malware like CoinHive highlights the ""need for advanced threat prevention technologies"" to curb such practices and protect networks from cyber-criminals.  Horowitz added:  ""Crypto mining is a new, silent, yet significant actor in the threat landscape, allowing threat actors to make significant revenues while victims' endpoints and networks suffer from latency and decreased performance.""  According to the report, malware variant RoughTed (adware) topped the index, followed by Locky (ransomware) and Seamless (traffic redirection).  Recently, internet domain provider Cloudflare suspended websites that ran hidden cryptocurrency miners, including that of the operator of torrent site ProxyBunker. This site was said to be running the Coinhive miner for four days prior to the suspension.

42428063,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5jhh,1510650012,"I'll Give You My Bitcoin When You Pry It From My Cold, Dead Hands","Every once in a while, it's useful to revisit the core value propositions of cryptocurrencies.  One of the most underappreciated, at least outside of the technology's inner circles, is the fact that bitcoin and the like can give individuals a greater degree of financial autonomy.  The reason it's underappreciated, I suspect, is that like privacy, autonomy is one of those qualities no one cherishes – until it's gone.  Be your own bank? Really?  Stepping back, ""be your own bank"" is a favorite slogan of the early cryptocurrency adopters. This baffles bitcoin skeptics, and understandably so.  Key management is a fussy business, nerve-racking and all too easy to screw up. Some digital currency doubters say it's simply beyond the skill set of the average consumer.  There's a whiff of paternalism in that claim, though. After all, people still cook for themselves (an activity that involves knives, fire and sometimes animal bacteria!) and drive their own cars (for now); how much harder can it really be to make up a random string of words and keep it a secret?  Then again, why would anyone want to bother with paper wallets or mnemonic recovery phrases when they can just store their money at a bank, a business that specializes in safekeeping? Here in the U.S., your balance is insured up $250,000 by the FDIC in the event the institution fails.  You might even earn some paltry rate of interest on your money, along with peace of mind unimaginable at a bitcoin exchange. (Don't worry, the banker probably won't set up an unauthorized account in your name to hit a sales quota.)  From this narrow perspective, being your own bank looks like way more trouble than it's worth.  An insurance policy  But let's zoom out the lens a bit.  Consider the slow but steady erosion of due process and property rights in the Land of the Free through policies such as civil asset forfeiture (in which law enforcement can seize assets from citizens suspected of committing a crime, whether or not they have been convicted or even charged).  Next, consider the lack of constitutional protections to begin with in many other countries. Finally, layer on top of these unsettling realities the worldwide gradual phasing out of physical cash, which at least you can put in your socks.  All of a sudden, those trusted, regulated financial institutions start to look like potential back doors.  In this light, the mere option of being your own bank, for at least a portion of your wealth, starts to sound a little bit more appealing.  Untouchable money  Inb4  the strawmen: I am not claiming that cryptocurrency users are ""above the law."" An individual who refuses to give up his private keys under court order can still be thrown in jail.  The point is that the government has to throw that person in jail, or perhaps beat him with the proverbial rubber hose, to get him to comply. It can't unilaterally seize his funds.  A defiant crypto holder might borrow a slogan from the late actor and gun-rights advocate Charlton Heston...  In this way, cryptocurrency claws back a modicum of power for the individual.  The historical significance of this innovation – self-sovereign money – was explained beautifully in a blog post by Nathan Cook, a bitcoin user in Tel Aviv.  In a post, first published two years ago, he wrote:  ""An owner of bitcoin no longer has the problem faced by the owner of any other transferable asset: 'will my property rights be respected?' Holders of bitcoin own it in virtue of material facts independent of their social relations. The world may turn its back on bitcoin, yea, its value may fall to fractions of a cent, but those who own it, will own it regardless.""  Just to be clear: this is hardly a reason to empty your checking account or 401(k) and put it all down on crypto (another strawman I encounter frequently on social media).  But it's a damn good reason to be thankful bitcoin exists in the world.

42428051,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5jPh,1510648219,Ubin Part 2: Singapore Central Bank Publishes Blockchain Project Details,"The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the city-state's de facto central bank, has released a new report focused on the second phase of its ""Project Ubin"" blockchain initiative.  The report constitutes a sequel of sorts to an earlier test which involved the MAS and a consortium of major banks, along with distributed ledger startup R3 and professional services firm Deloitte.  And while that phase focused on the digitization of the Singapore dollar as data on a blockchain, the second round tackled an area subject to tests by other central banks world wide: the real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system. Indeed, it represents a kind of natural progression, given that RTGS systems – run by institutions like the MAS – handle large amounts of currency moving from bank to bank.  The second phase of Project Ubin, representatives said earlier this year, was aimed at researching how a system underpinned in part by the tech would compare with existing systems. The test focused on three platforms – Hyperledger Fabric, R3's Corda and JPMorgan's ethereum-based Quorum – and also involved the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) and professional services firm Accenture.  As detailed in the report, the project determined that the platforms tested could serve as bases for distributed ledger-based RTGS systems. Notably, the authors state that should such a system come into operation,""the conventional role of a central bank or payment system operator as the centralised infrastructure operator in the ecosystem will be obsolete.""  The report states:  ""This would also mean that a central financial market infrastructure operator would not be necessary, as the processes and data are distributed across the participants in the DLT network. A DLT-based RTGS system reduces the costs and resources for the day-to-day operations and eliminates the risk of the central bank being the single-point-of-failure of the entire financial ecosystem.""  Yet as argued, a central bank in that kind of environment would still serve several roles, such as making sure that node operators are running the latest software and resolving any disputes that emerge between parties.  Phase three?  As indicated in the report, Project Ubin is likely to continue in future phases.  One use case up for further testing, according to the MAS, would focus on bond payments. While the exact details aren't clear, the central bank suggested that Singapore's stock exchange may become involved in such an initiative.  ""Future phases of Project Ubin could focus on a decentralized bonds payments system, which could be supported by MAS and the participant banks with execution driven by Singapore Exchange. This could deliver a more efficient fixed income securities trading and settlement cycle through DLT,"" the report stated.  Additionally, the report suggested that some of the technology approaches researched in the first two phases of Project Ubin could be further developed to achieve other purposes, including cross-border payments.

Speaking at a press conference this week, deputy director of new technologies, Naser Hakimi, said that the government-owned central bank is studying bitcoin and that it plans a comprehensive review of its policies in this area. The remarks came amid a wider set of comments on how the central bank will pursue financial technology policy broadly.  Still, Hakimi's statements on cryptocurrency focused mostly on the ""uncertainty"" and ""risk"" brought about by speculation in the market, as he suggested investors who seek exposure may be putting their capital at risk.  Hakimi was quoted as saying:  ""Given that bitcoin and other currencies have not been introduced by the central bank as the official currency, as well as the risk of buying it and the activity of traders in this field, more precautions are coming into the market because of the possibility of malice.""  The comments build on statements issued earlier this year, when according to Irani newspaper the Financial Tribune, Hakimi recently referred to bitcoin in Iran as an ""opportunity.""  At the time, he said the idea of a national digital currency has been pitched and is under evaluation.  But while the comments don't offer too much in the way of detail, the Central Bank of Iran is nonetheless emerging as one of the more active in the region on the subject. (Few companies and countries in the Middle East have acknowledged bitcoin or cryptocurrencies.)  Last month, Lebanon's Central Bank governor announced plans to launch its own digital currency, though he was not yet clear if the project will be based on blockchain technology.  This was followed by criticisms from the head of the central bank of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) who stressed on the lack of supervision around bitcoin, claiming that it facilitates money laundering and terrorism financing.  Editor's Note: Some of the statements in this report have been translated from Persian.

42428058,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5jXh,1510628454,Mastercard Seeks Patent for Instant Blockchain Payments Processing,"New patent filings from Mastercard show how the credit card giant is looking at blockchain as a possible means for easing payment settlement times.  In a patent application released last week by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the company describes a blockchain-based database capable of instantaneously processing payments, guaranteeing that merchants don't need to wait days before receiving funds for their products.  Further, the filings indicate that the tech would help the firm keep an ongoing record of these transactions, verifying that a vendor was actually paid after a particular sale.  The data being stored would include the transaction amount, a guarantee of payment, confirmation of the payment and account profiles for the parties involved. These account profiles will also store each users's balance information, according to the application.  As the application details:  “There is a need for a technical solution where a payment transaction can be guaranteed in a manner that is readily verifiable by an acquiring financial institution and/or merchant, and where the guarantee can be used in conjunction with multiple types of payment instruments as well as multiple transaction types, including e-commerce transactions.”  Mastercard has repeatedly considered blockchain platforms to ease payments. Last month, the company announced it was opening up access to the blockchain tools it was developing in order to facilitate business-to-business transactions.  An earlier patent application released in September likewise focused on storing payment histories using a blockchain.
