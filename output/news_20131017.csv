42397277,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaoCFc,1382044554,St. John's is 'world's first Catholic church to accept bitcoin',"As people move away from slips of paper to digital forms of money, there’s a possibility the concept of the cash donation might decline. But that’s not the real reason Father Adaly Rosado Jr. from the Church of St. John the Evangelist in Goshen, NY decided to put a virtual currencies donation button on the parish’s website.  “I put it up a year ago. I was just curious to see what would happen,” Father Rosado said.  Unfortunately, only 0.488 BTC have been donated so far, which is around $60 at recent CoinDesk BPI rates. The church has over 2,900 registered parishioners, though, so if he can spread the word about digital currency, he could soon notice more bitcoin donations come flooding in.  Father Rosado  believes that St. John’s the Evangelist is the first Catholic Church to accept bitcoins and he thinks virtual currency donations can be much more useful than those in fiat currencies.  “In theory, in the future, you could exchange bitcoins for any currency. It would be faster to move money around,” said Father Rosado.  He explained that traditional methods have failed him in the past - for example a check he sent to a youth group in the Dominican Republic was lost in the mail so he had to cancel the check and use a service similar to Western Union in order to send the money. All of this took time - time that could have been saved if bitcoin was used.  While St. John’s biggest donation denomination is still in cash, Father Rosado has brought newer digital options to the congregation. PayPal and Parish Payhttps://www.parishpay.com/homepage.asp, a Christian-backed form of PayPal, is also accepted.  The church is also accepting litecoin donations. Father Rosado likened bitcoin to gold and litecoin to silver. ""If people want to give us that, no problem. The way I see it, this is money that we would not have had otherwise.""  The Catholic church isn't the only religious institution that has expressed interest in bitcoin. Jackson Beazer, social media supervisor at The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints said his church is ""very aware of and excited about technological advances and changes"".  He went on to explain that Mormons have embraced many technological changes in recent years, adding:  ""The Church is very much excited for and hopeful for any new change or technological tool that can help make life easier, more convenient, and will help us accomplish our purpose throughout the world as smoothly as possible.""  Father Rosado is happy that someone decided to donate bitcoins to his church, but, due to the anonymous nature of bitcoin transactions, is unsure who it was. “I have no idea who put the 0.488 bitcoin in the account, but if these anonymous people want to donate, then we will accept it!”  No matter where it came from, it’s clear that donations could and should become a big aspect of virtual currencies. Father Rosado suggested that the more these units of value are moved around, the more people will believe in their abilities to behave just like the fiat currencies everyone is used to.  “One thing people do with actual money is donate it. People want to do this, which can make bitcoin an actual currency,"" he said.  Check out St. John’s bitcoin donation page or their litecoin donation page if you’re interested in giving some virtual currency to the church.  What do you think about the future of cash donations? Will they be replaced eventually with virtual currencies? Let us know in the comments.

42376617,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bTZt,1382017202,Bitcoin meets Google Glass with in-store payment app GlassPay,"An app that enables people to pay in bitcoin for items in-store via Google Glass has been unveiled in the US.  Called GlassPay, the app was developed by New York-based RedBottle Design. It enables consumers to enjoy some of the convenience of the online buying experience during their visits to real bricks and mortar shops.  ""With GlassPay, we're taking one of the most basic cultural experiences, the act of purchasing items, and bringing it into the future,"" said Guy Paddock, CEO of RedBottle Design.  ""Bitcoins are gaining significant acceptance in the worldwide marketplace, and we know that face-to-face, app-based shopping and purchasing is in the next wave. We're ready for it,"" he added.  Google Glass  and Android users simply have to scan the barcodes of items in their physical shopping basket, which be added to a virtual 'shopping cart'. They then purchase the items using bitcoins, which means they don’t have to queue to pay for their goods, nor carry a wallet.  [post-quote]  Another benefit to consumers is that the GlassPay shopping cart operates in real time, which means the total is updated after they scan each item, allowing the customer to budget more effectively.  Retailers and merchants also benefit from payments made via GlassPay as they do not have to pay card-processing fees.  However, retailers may be concerned that GlassPay could lead to an increase in shoplifting, with people pretending they had paid for items when they in fact hadn't. Last year, money saving website Watch My Wallet conducted a survey of nearly 5,000 customers and found that 30% had stolen items when using self-service tills.  Some 13% of those surveyed said they were tempted to steal at self-service checkouts any only refrained because they were afraid of getting caught. The majority of people (58%), however, said they had not stolen from the automated system and never would.  Paddock said GlassPay plans to work with retailers to create customized solutions that will help them avoid any proof of purchase issues. He explained:  ""The solution will depend on the merchant's sales process. If they're like IKEA or Best Buy where the customer spends a lot of time on the sales floor show room before completing the purchase, then the retailer can make it so the customer's order is actually prepared for them, which would only happen after payment approval.""  Paddock said that in a grocery environment, the payment system could integrate with a kiosk or mobile app used by a greeter at the door. ""The customer could provide their order number and the greeter could pull up the order for reference to compare what was scanned to what the customer has. It's similar to what retailers like Costco do with greeters who check receipts of buyers who had used self checkout lanes, except it would be paperless.""  GlassPay is being demonstrated at the DEMO 2013 conference in Santa Clara this week, where the creators will presumably address any fears both consumers and merchants may have. The app is expected feature in the Play marketplace and Glass Boutique, in the second quarter of 2014, following the launch of Google Glass.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/10/17/bitcoin-meets-google-glass-with-in-store-payment-app-glasspay,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4ab96dbb0d24bfe862c1a3aeac3c8ca1998160d4-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376623,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bTgB,1382008552,Why the US debt crisis didn't affect bitcoin,"Well, that was close. US Congress pulled the US back from the brink of a currency default last night – at least, for a little while. After over two weeks of battling between Republicans and Democrats, which saw a public sector shutdown, it finally passed a bill that would enable the government to reopen and pay its bills, just hours before the critical deadline. But if the US had gone over the edge, what could it have meant for bitcoiners? And if it happens again in a few months, what should we expect?  Another round of political chest-puffing isn't out of the question. This latest spat started when right wing tea party members refused to fund the US government unless it agreed to eviscerate the Affordable Health Care Act (nicknamed 'Obamacare'). The stand-off took the country to the brink of economic disaster, as the government grew close to the point where a lack of funds would prevent it from paying its bills. This would represent a default on US currency.  Some say that would be catastrophic, others slightly less so. This is because there are two types of default. There are cosmetic ones, where the US technically runs out of money but moves things behind the curtain, like Oz the Great and Powerful, to satisfy foreign debt holders. It could prioritize foreign debts over internal spending, sacrificing social programs, although this would not come without consequences. Heavily-armed populations without food stamps are a bad thing.  In any case, the US couldn’t keep that up forever. Eventually, the US would have to stop paying its bills, for real. “If there's an actual [not cosmetic] default, the world has bigger things to worry about than bitcoin,” says Jon Matonis, executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation and a contributing editor at CoinDesk. “Safety and food would be larger concerns,” he added.  All this is still worrying, because we’re not out of the woods yet. Bill HR 2775, passed by the Senate and a grudging House last night, only maintains spending limits until mid-January, and extends the federal borrowing limit until 7th February. It delays, rather than solves, the problem. Both sides have to keep talking, and experience suggests that they’re not particularly good at it. Republicans have already said that they’ll continue fighting Obama’s healthcare bill. So it’s possible that we could end up here again well before the spring. It’s happened before, in 2011, when partisan squabbles threatened the government’s ability to pay its debts.  Bitcoin’s time to shine?  Normally when a world economic crisis hits, people flee to the US dollar. It happened in 2008, even though the US was largely the cause of the financial problem.  Even then, the US dollar was seen as a safe bet. But if the country caused an economic crisis by defaulting on its own currency, the dollar would be seen as less trustworthy. So if this problem comes around again in a few months, will people flee to bitcoin as an alternative?  Probably not, says Kevin Zhou, head economist at Buttercoin, which sells a software engine for bitcoin exchanges. Even most fund managers aren’t that clued up about the cryptocurrency, argues Zhou, who handled quantitative research at Standard & Poors and post-trade analysis at Cutler Group before taking a role at Buttercoin. Even fewer individual investors will be bitcoin-savvy. Zhou said:  “If technical default happened 3-5 years down the line, there’d be a lot more traction with bitcoin, but in the near term, most people would fly to the Swiss Franc, maybe the Japanese Yen, and maybe gold and silver.”  In any case, bitcoin is still a risky asset compared to gold. “Bitcoin, while it shares numerous properties with gold, is still missing one – that of history and long-standing performance,” says bitcoin expert and entrepreneur Erik Voorhees, who sold SatoshiDice for almost $12m earlier in the year. “It is still new, exotic, volatile, and highly speculative.”  Roger Ver, president of bitcoinstore.com and a member of the BitAngels investment team, doesn’t think that bitcoin would be massively affected by a US default. “I don't think this would have an immediate short-term impact,” he told CoinDesk. “It would be one more example of why we need the separation of money and State that bitcoin represents.”  Lack of knowledge is one reason why bitcoin might not be hit hard by a US default. The other is a lack of size. As of last night, bitcoin’s entire market capitalization would pay for just under four hours interest on the massive US debt. Bitcoin is very important to its advocates, but largely irrelevant to the majority of investors.  Rising prices  Someone watching the pricing charts over the last few weeks might wonder if the threat of a default hadn't pushed prices higher, though. The market crashed for a short period when Silk Road was taken down, but quickly rebounded, and is now in rude health. As of last night, prices were higher than they have been since May, when bitcoin ended a particularly volatile month, having spiked above $140 on several occasions over the prior month.  October’s recovery and soaring prices happened during exactly the same window as the shutdown crisis. But Ver puts this down to added media attention, while Voorhees attributes it to a mixture of increased confidence following the quick Silk Road recovery, and the Baidu announcement this week.  In any case, says Ver, “there will never be an actual default. They will print more dollars to pay the debt, causing massive inflation”.  Not that this is particularly preferable. Ongoing borrowing caused by untrammelled spending is a grim alternative to a default, and it worries Jaron Lukasiewicz, CEO of bitcoin exchange Coinsetter, which comes out of beta next week and will be open to the general public. “It is a mathematical fact that our country will either need to default on its debt or experience a large amount of inflation,"" he says. “This unfortunate circumstance makes me passionate about bitcoin.”  Bitcoin already shines  He’s passionate because bitcoin isn’t inflationary. Like gold, it is limited – more so, in fact, as you can’t keep finding new bitcoins and pulling them out of the ground. Neither can you simply keep printing as many as you need, as the federal reserve does with US dollars. Once we’ve mined 21 million bitcoins, that’s it.  Bitcoin’s deflationary characteristics may not make it unique, but its decentralized nature does. “One of the reasons that bitcoin is touted as a way to preserve your capital and retain value is that it isn’t just centrally controlled, and so it can’t be freely printed and debased,” says Zhou.  Jonathan Silverman, head of trading at currently-benched exchange Tradehill, doesn’t even like comparing bitcoin to other assets. He argues that every year it has existed, bitcoin’s value has accumulated no less than 400%.  Silverman, a former trader at Morgan Stanley, who moved to Tradehill after wanting to explore the digital currency space, said:  “You plot these things against each other and you look at them and ask ‘is this even a comparable good?'""  The cryptocurrency cannot be controlled by a small cadre of politically-motivated people, willing to bring a government to its knees over an ideological issue. And while bitcoin may still be considered a marginal, risky currency, it is getting stronger. Bitcoin came from shaky beginnings, with exchanges that disappeared almost half of the time, often taking their customers’ coins with them, but things are changing.  The cryptocurrency now has a stronger exchange infrastructure, and a clearer path forward from a regulatory perspective in a number of developed economies, says Silverman. It also gained interest from people with deeper pockets, such as the Winklevii, and SecondMarket. And then, there are the merchants that are making it more tractable everywhere. “Bitcoin is scarce, and it’s becoming more useful, which makes it more valuable,” says Silverman.  So, while bitcoin is volatile, its relative indifference to the machinations of the US political system tells us something. Its fundamental differences to fiat currency, along with its gradually increasing maturity, are helping to shield it from short-term market shocks such as the one surrounding the debt crisis. Or, as Ver tweeted yesterday, bitcoin just might be the “honey badger of money”.  Honey badgers are relentless hardasses, with no natural predators. They’re small, but fear nothing. Bitcoin seems to have fit the description in the last two weeks, as it ate the USD’s lunch. So, amid the uncertainty, panic, and strife, should bitcoin exchanges be happy?  “Bitcoin exchanges don't have time to be happy,” says Voorhees. “They should brace themselves ... and probably upgrade some servers.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/10/17/why-the-us-debt-crisis-didnt-affect-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5fbba5388730dd204ccc2859e2e85f0f6a9a52b5-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
