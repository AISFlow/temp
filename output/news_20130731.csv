42376554,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6W2sp,1375289556,BTCTurk becomes the first Turkish lira-to-bitcoin exchange,"We've recently reported the rise of bitcoin in Iran, Afghanistan and Israel, but now another country has jumped on the digital currency bandwagon – Turkey.  BTCTurk launched earlier this month, becoming the first company to enable the exchange of Turkish lira for bitcoin and vice versa.  Emre Kenci, CTO of BTCTurk, said he and his colleagues started to develop the company in January 2013 having watched interest in bitcoin increase across the globe. He told CoinDesk that BTCTurk has received a ""good number"" of sign-ups since it launched.  ""Despite the fact that there is not a single merchant that accepts bitcoin in Turkey, a lot of people are interested in it. The launch of BTCTurk has made bitcoin very convenient for both users and potential merchants in Turkey and we expect the popularity to grow fast.""  Kenci said there are currently no laws in Turkey that specifically regulate bitcoin, but BTCTurk operates to the same know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering policies that are compulsory for banks in the country.  In other countries, the faltering local economy has been distinguished as one of the main reasons people are turning to bitcoin, but Kenci said this is not the case in Turkey. This country's economy is currently on its way up, with a 3% increase in GDP witnessed in the first three months of the year, which is the 14th consecutive quarter of expansion.  ""Bitcoin is too small to affect the Turkish economy in the short-term. Perhaps in the very long-term, bitcoin might help the Turkish economy by reducing currency weakness and high inflation,"" he added.  Fırat Demirel, a writer at Webrazzi.com, which closely follows bitcoin developments, agreed that bitcoin is currently too small to make any major changes in Turkey, but more people are becoming interested in the digital currency each day.  ""Webrazzi may be the single media channel in Turkey that talks regularly about bitcoin, but BTCTurk's launch was published on a few websites/newspapers. We are going to organise our annual conference - Webrazzi Summit 2013 - in September and, it's not certain yet, but bitcoin should be one of our topics,"" he said.  Demirel praised BTCTurk for providing people in Turkey with a way to purchase bitcoin with zero hassle and encouraged more people in the country to get behind the digital currency.

42425033,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHq2hh,1375283651,Marketplace Bitcoin.de registers with Germany's financial regulator BaFin,"Bitcoin Deutschland GmbH has received confirmation that, from 7th August, it will be registered with BaFin, Germany's Federal Financial Supervisory Authority.  The company operates bitcoin.de, a marketplace where people can exchange fiat currencies for bitcoins (and vice versa) with each other. Bitcoin.de has an arrangement with Fidor Bank, which means it is licensed to operate as a 'finance intermediary' while Fidor Bank bears the liability for bitcoin.de's operations.  Stefan Greiner, of Xenion Legal, said: ""This arrangement, as such, is nothing special as thousands of so-called 'independent' finance intermediaries in Germany operate under the same model (as 'tied agents'). The only special feature in the relationship between bitcoin.de and Fidor Bank is that the 'financial services' they are offering relate to bitcoins.""  He went on to say that, to his knowledge, neither bitcoin.de nor Fidor Bank is exchanging fiat currencies for bitcoins themselves. With this in mind, it appears bitcoin.de ""does not need to worry anymore that its bank accounts or the bank accounts of its clients will be shut down all of a sudden"".  ""Bitcoin.de's business model is fairly specific. Therefore I believe the consequences of the registration with BaFin for other bitcoin companies in Germany or elsewhere should be minimal,"" Greiner added.  He said it is promising that BaFin has actually accepted a financial service relating to bitcoins rather than taking prohibitive action, but he doesn't believe Germany will become the first wholly bitcoin-friendly nation in the world.  ""Germany has an inherent tendency to over-regulate. However, with the Euro crisis latent in the background and the growing start-up scene, primarily in Berlin, maybe – hopefully – Germany will become a bit more experimental,"" Greiner added.  A document originally published by BaFin on 20th December 2011, but updated on 19th July this year, clearly states that bitcoins are 'units of accounts' and therefore can be classed as 'financial instruments'. This, in principle, means that any regulation pertaining to financial instruments is applicable to bitcoin.
