42410134,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcTSdu,1690327358,Bitcoin Steady at $29.3K After Fed Rate Hike and Powell Press Conference,"Bitcoin (BTC) continued to trade higher by 0.3% for the day at just above $29,300 after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised its fed funds rate by 25 basis points to a range of 5.25%-5.50%. The widely-anticipated move is having little effect on traditional markets as well, with the major U.S. equity indexes continuing to trade modestly lower.  Alongside that quiet action, a number of altcoins are still holding sizable moves higher on Wednesday, led by Origin Protocol's OGN token with a 28% advance. Also on the move is Compound's COMP, ahead 16.8%, Convex Finance's CVX, up 9.7% and Solana's SOL with a 6% gain.  Among those cryptos headed lower is Lido DAO's LDO, off 5%. The worst performer per CoinDesk data is AMP's AMP, lower by 13%.  At his post-meeting press conference, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said no decisions about future rate hikes or pauses had been made, and stressed that the central bank will be highly data dependent going forward. He noted, for instance, that the Fed will have two additional employment reports and two additional inflation reports to mull over before its next rate-setting meeting in September.  Powell also said that the Fed staff was no longer anticipating a recession. This is notable as the staff's forecast for the past few months had been for a mild recession. The comments briefly knocked bitcoin lower by about $150, but the price quickly rebounded.

15294697,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=544296,1690326000,"Crypto Analyst Says It’s Time To Buy Dogecoin, Here’s Why","Dogecoin remains one of the popular coins despite the crypto bear market and its resilience has seen it garner a significant following. And now, after a long and stretched-out downtrend, a crypto analyst has sounded the buy alarm for the meme coin, giving reasons for this. Time To Buy Dogecoin? According to a crypto analyst known as Kaleo on Twitter, Dogecoin’s current range is a good place to buy. The reasoning for this revolves around expectations that billionaire Elon Musk will integrate the meme coin as a payment method for Twitter. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Transfers To Exchanges Suggest More Selling Pressure For ETH This comes after the billionaire recently incorporated the infamous DOGE logo on his Twitter profile, placing it next to X, the new symbol for the social media platform. And as Kaleo points out, “There’s a solid chance he actually does something this time though, and him including it in his bio at the same time as the X rebrand isn’t just a coincidence.” However, the analyst also points to the fact that this may not be a completely smooth ride for the altcoin. For example, Kaleo explains that Dogecoin’s current rally could reach a cool-off period where it falls in line with the general crypto market trend. But he added that it would be a good idea to “accumulate on any dips we get from here.” DOGE surges 9% to $0.077 | Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview.com What Happens To DOGE If It Is A Payment Method On Twitter? Dogecoin becoming a payment method on the Twitter platform (now X) has been long-awaited by not just the DOGE community but the broader crypto market. This is because such an integration will give the cryptocurrency its most significant use case to date, while also exposing it to the hundreds of millions of users of the social media platform. Historically, whenever Elon Musk has tweeted about the meme coin, it has led to a rapid increase in price. So it is expected that such an announcement of Dogecoin being a verified payment method on Twitter will lead to an at least 100% rally for the digital asset. Related Reading: Bullish Signal: Whales Accumulate Massive Amounts Of ARB If DOGE were to be integrated as an accepted form of payment on Twitter, it is possible that the price of the meme coin will rally toward $0.2. However, “it’ll happen fast, and the entire timeline will say it was obvious in retrospect,” Kaleo explains. For now, DOGE’s price is still trending at $0.077, a 9% increase from its Monday price, according to data from Coinmarketcap. Nevertheless, DOGE remains the 7th-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $10.89 billion.

Anyway, here's my effort to catch up.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Rulings, arrests and bills  The narrative  It was a really busy [checks notes] 11 days, huh?  Why it matters  The legal and regulatory aspects of the crypto ecosystem continue to evolve.  Breaking it down  I was on vacation for a bit. Here is a list of things that happened in crypto regulatory land in that time (that I've seen):  Alex Mashinsky of Celsius was arrested and pleaded not guilty to charges of securities fraud, commodities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy to manipulate the price of CEL (Celsius’ token). The Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Federal Trade Commission also filed lawsuits (the FTC and Celsius settled, though executives including Mashinsky, Shlomi Daniel Leon and Hanoch “Nuke” Goldstein didn’t).  The federal judge overseeing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's case against Ripple Labs published a decision on the motions for summary judgment, ruling that while Ripple violated securities laws in its institutional sales, it did not do so in putting XRP on exchanges and letting the retail public buy the tokens through those intermediaries.  The SEC acknowledged and started the clock on a bunch of bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications.  The Group of 20 said it welcomed Financial Stability Board recommendations on stablecoin and crypto asset activity arrangements.  The U.S. Secret Service seized around $58 million in funds belonging to Deltec Bank as part of an investigation into an international money laundering investigation. A Deltec spokesperson said it had been cooperating with U.S. law enforcement and intended to file a claim for the cash.  A Marathon Digital Holdings shareholder is suing the company’s directors and officers, alleging they lied about Marathon’s revenue and operations.  BlockFi’s leadership saw FTX’s balance sheet but continued to use the platform, a filing by its creditors said.  A state court signed off on the Nevada Department of Business and Industry’s move to place crypto custodian Prime Trust into receivership.  A group of senators introduced a bill that would impose bank-like regulations on decentralized finance.  Coin Center’s suit against the U.S. Treasury Department over the pending section 6050I provision in the bipartisan infrastructure law was dismissed due to a lack of “ripeness” – or as the court put it, the issue is too hypothetical right now.  The Federal Reserve launched its FedNow instant payments service.  Republicans in the House Financial Services and Agriculture Committees introduced a new version of its market structure bill, which will go to markup in both committees this week.  FTX’s new management filed suit to recover more than $1 billion in cash and shares from its old management.  The U.S. Department of Justice accused former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried of leaking the personal diary of former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison, who he had previously been in a relationship with, to discredit her as a witness in his upcoming criminal trial. Bankman-Fried’s attorneys denied that he was trying to discredit her, but acknowledged that he had provided a New York Times reporter with unspecified materials not obtained through discovery.  The U.S. Department of Justice folded its National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team into its broader cyber unit, according to the Wall Street Journal.  The SEC told the judge overseeing its case against Terraform Labs that the Ripple ruling created two different standards, suggesting it may appeal the ruling in its case against Ripple.  Apparently a group of investors are getting close to acquiring a crypto media business.  What'd I miss? Shoot me an email.

42410118,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcTSA9,1690319782,AI Creates Security Risks and Attack Vectors. Can Blockchain Help?,"There is no doubt that artificial intelligence (AI) has tremendous potential to enhance our lives. But many scholars, science fiction writers and technologists have sounded alarm bells over AI’s possible dangers. To this point, President Joe Biden’s administration aims to update an existing blueprint for AI principles to address data security, algorithmic discrimination and other threats.  But AI poses immediate risks, too. With AI comes new attack vectors for hackers to exploit, and Microsoft’s Chief Security Advisor Terence Jackson wrote in Forbes that “attackers may generate new and complex types of malware, phishing schemes and other cyber dangers that can avoid conventional protection measures.”  Chao Cheng-Shorland is CEO and co-founder of ShelterZoom, a leading Web3 smart-document and cyber resilience SaaS provider that built Document GPS.  Hospitals and healthcare organizations live under the constant shadow of ransomware attacks and data breaches. In the security context, AI introduces new security risks across organizations, while blockchain technology could present itself as a solution to this problem. (Of course, that’s not to overlook the tremendous potential AI offers healthcare in other spheres.)  Harnessing the best of AI while avoiding the worst-case scenarios of ""the Singularity"" requires a different approach to security, and blockchain technology provides that.  Even before ChatGPT, organizations from all sectors needed proactive cybersecurity capabilities to safeguard their sensitive data. With the expansion of AI applications in the workplace, it would be wise for founders, executives or IT managers to seriously consider using blockchain technology to not only boost efficiency but enable the highest level of data security.  After all, data, for most organizations, represents the most important asset.  By storing data in a decentralized and immutable manner, blockchain rejects unauthorized modifications or tampering with datasets used for training AI models. Blockchain applications can also stop AI from abusing the unauthorized generation of content intelligence. Since businesses involved in AI often need to send secure information to one another, blockchain-based platforms can facilitate secure sharing among organizations.  Blockchain’s inherent security and transparency can even help combat deep fakes and other fake AI-generated content through its immutable and traceable nature that secures ownership.  One can even imagine, for example, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crime Enforcement Network (FinCEN) using blockchain technology to create databases of financial records and dealings, and then applying an AI algorithm to analyze the data to detect cases of fraud or other abnormalities. In this scenario, the two technologies operate independently of each other, rather than being integrated into a single tool, product or platform.  While it's true no one really knows exactly what the full integration of blockchain and AI would look like, there are some existing products and technologies that could provide a model for understanding.  Take cloud computing’s scalability and accessibility combined with the availability of big data. This conceivably enables businesses across virtually any industry to leverage AI capabilities without having to invest in expensive and complex infrastructure to build an AI.  What I mean by this is that AI is more than just smart vacuums and ChatGPT. And blockchain is obviously more than just Bitcoin and NFTs.  See also: ChatGPT Will Kill Search and Open a Path to Web3 | Opinion  Just as AI is already being used by organizations in a number of everyday work functions from customer service to accounting and telemedicine, blockchain technology is already streamlining supply chain operations, digital identity verification and even allowing healthcare providers to enable easier patient access to medical records.  AI is already here, and its use will continue to expand with or without regulation.

42410119,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcTSDS,1690319206,RWA Tokenization: What Does It Mean to Tokenize Real-World Assets?,"Imagine you want to buy an Andy Warhol artwork. Most of us can’t afford to fork over record-breaking sums like $195 million for a Marilyn painting or even $850,000 for a mere print of Queen Elizabeth. Many people want to buy art either for pleasure or as an investment but are priced out. But what if you could buy “shares” of an artwork like you can buy fractions of a publicly traded company? That’s the idea behind tokenization of real-world assets.  The Warhol use case is real: a company called Freeport offered fractionalized shares of Andy Warhol paintings, creating 1,000 tokens that represent shares of the work that anyone can buy. As of writing, for just under $200, I could own 1/1000th of Warhol’s Rebel Without a Cause.  This tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) isn’t just happening in art, but in bonds, cars, gold, houses and more. It’s a concept that’s gaining momentum and interest from traditional finance players.  In this piece, we’ll break down how real-world asset tokenization works and the advantages it offers to investors.  See Also: Tokenize Everything: Institutions Bet That Crypto’s Future Lies in the Real World  Tokenizing Real-World Assets Explained  The core idea of real-world asset tokenization is basically to create a virtual investment vehicle on the blockchain linked to tangible things like real estate, precious metals, art and collectibles. So instead of the deed to a house being a physical piece of paper, the ownership is put on-chain. This could be traded between two parties directly, or fractionalized and offered to many people to buy.  The advantages of keeping the ownership of the real-world items on chain are many:  It lowers costs by removing middlemen like lawyers, brokers, banks, etc.  It allows fast, efficient 24/7 trading of items that traditionally only could be done during “working hours”  It lowers the barrier to entry and creates more liquidity  Its transparent process increases trust and accountability for traders  To take it back to the Warhol painting, if 1,000 people own shares of a single artwork, people can speculate and trade around those shares at any time, without any need to coordinate with the other owners. Instead of having a single seller have to work with a gallery, appraiser, lawyer and bank, each of whom will charge a fee or commission to sell to a single buyer, the seller and buyer can trade directly with each other and pay only minimal gas fees to instantly transfer the asset.  It’s not only high-value items like vintage cars, real estate and gold that are getting tokenized, but also U.S. Treasuries, currency and stocks.  Bob Ras, co-founder of the exchange and digital-asset ecosystem Sologenic, told CoinDesk that tokenized real-world assets for things such as stocks can account for fractional ownerships more efficiently and generate faster settlement times, noting that transactions on the blockchain don’t have the up-to-72-hour settlement time that traditional markets take. This speed and efficiency helps smaller investors with fewer funds be able to participate in investments that otherwise would be out of reach for them.  In the case of fiat currency, stablecoins are the most obvious form of real-world asset tokenization. Tokens such as Tether or USDC are tokenized dollars. Each token represents one actual dollar that the company has in reserve, and allows for faster and direct settlements between parties.

Investment fund giant Franklin Templeton launched the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund in 2021 on Stellar and expanded to Polygon in 2023. The fund is the first U.S. registered mutual fund to use a public blockchain to process transactions and record share ownership.  The Bank of America recently called RWA tokenization a “key driver of digital-asset adoption.” According to their report, the tokenized gold market has captured over $1 billion in investment. There’s also a growing demand for tokenized U.S. Treasury bonds, with the combined market capitalization of tokenized money market funds nearing $500 million, according to data compiled by CoinDesk.  Right now, the future looks bright for tokenization with global business advisory firm Boston Consulting Group forecasting that the market for tokenized assets could mushroom to $16 trillion by 2030.

This step is the motorcycle company’s first venture into the Web3 space and blockchain technology. Related Reading: Cardano TVL – A Crucial Factor For ADA Price Revival? Ducati Delves Into Web3; Prepares To Launch First NFT Collection Ducati, a renowned motorcycle manufacturer established in 1926, is set to enter the world of Web3 by launching its first-ever digital collectibles on the XRP Ledger. The Bologna-based firm believes this step is essential to strengthen its relationship with its global community. Claudia Domenicali, CEO of Ducati, commented on the Web3 move: Entering WEB 3.0 is another way to get closer to the Ducatisti community by further extending the number of services offered to them. It also represents an opportunity to meet and make ourselves known to a new community of NFT enthusiasts, giving them the opportunity to live unique Ducati-style experiences and collect the digital assets that we will develop exclusively for this new dimension of the brand.

It is worth mentioning that Ducati also collaborated with Web3 Pro, a white-label Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform, in the execution of this NFT project. A Win For Ripple And XRP Ledger? The XRP Ledger is a public, decentralized blockchain designed by Ripple, the company behind the XRP token. Blockchain technology allows for the creation of tokens, which are IOUs representing any currency value, and the production of NFTs. Indeed, XRP Ledger is not the most popular choice amongst enthusiasts regarding non-fungible tokens. However, the blockchain has been experiencing significant activity recently, with more than 1 million non-fungible tokens minted in the first quarter of 2023. With Ducati set to launch its first-ever NFT collection, XRPL may likely enjoy increased adoption and on-chain activity in the coming months. Moreover, Ripple has been in the spotlight following its victory over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on July 13. Related Reading: Ripple’s XRP Sales Jump Significantly In 2023, But Is This Bearish For The Altcoin? It is worth pointing out the timing of Ducati’s NFT rollout on the XRP Ledger.

Ripple Wins the Lawsuit against the SEC... or not yet? On July 13, 2023, Judge Analise Torres partially ruled in favor of Ripple Labs in the case against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC), putting an end to a 3-year-long crusade. The historic victory made the XRP token skyrocket in value and sent the bullish wave to the whole crypto market. However, some believe that the battle is not over yet, as the SEC still has the option to file an appeal. Law expert James Murphy known on Twitter as “MetaLawMan” has shed some light on the matter. In his recent Tweet of July 25, Murphy identified four options the SEC currently has and described how each could work. So, What Could the SEC Do Next? According to the expert, the first option on the table for the SEC is to file a request for an interlocutory appeal. At the moment, the SEC doesn't have the unilateral right to appeal as the final judgment has not been entered yet. To proceed with an interlocutory appeal, the SEC would need to ask the permission of Judge Torres and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. To get this permission, Murphy explains that the SEC would need to prove that: “The ruling involves a controlling question of law; There is substantial grounds for difference of opinion on that question; An immediate appeal may materially advance the litigation.” There’s no deadline for the initial request, although it’s likely to be done within 30 days. In case Judge Torres agrees, the SEC would have 10 days to seek permission from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. The second option for the SEC is to start a trial on the aiding and abetting claim against Larsen and Garlinghouse and file a regular appeal after. Another potential path for the SEC is to drop the claim against Larsen and Garlinghouse. This would allow the SEC to take an immediate appeal without seeking permission. Finally, the SEC has the option to settle, although Murphey believes that it’s highly unlikely due to the political considerations. James Murphy concludes that the first option is the most probable because the SEC is under pressure to get the Torres decision reversed and because the Ripple case could influence lawsuits against other crypto platforms such as Coinbase and Binance. Overall, the expert is quite optimistic about the Ripple’s chances: “I expect the SEC to file a request for interlocutory appeal within the next 2 weeks. I believe it would be in the best interests of Ripple & the #XRPCommunity for the appeals process to start now--rather than a year from now. And I like Ripple's chances on appeal.” Meanwhile, the price of XRP has been shining green in the last 10 days, even though it still hasn’t reached a $1 mark.

42410137,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcTT4M,1690316272,Bitcoin Mining Has a Superpower,"The rapid rise of cryptocurrencies, particularly bitcoin, has sparked widespread debate on their environmental impact. Bitcoin mining in particular often receives significant scrutiny, with critics arguing the energy-intensive process of mining strains electrical grids and wastes energy.  This could not be further from the truth. Bitcoin miners increase the resilience of energy grids, incentivize renewable energy development and create jobs in rural regions. Bitcoin miners are flexible, location agnostic loads that can respond to grid frequency events with unparalleled granularity.  This story is part of CoinDesk's 2023 Mining Week, sponsored by Foundry. Lee Bratcher is president and founder of the Texas Blockchain Council.  Mining’s energy use spurs its most visceral critiques but, it is this aspect of mining that will have the more significant transformational effects. We must embrace the nuance of this concept in our conversations with the media, policymakers, elected officials and the general public.  One of the primary advantages of bitcoin mining lies in its potential to provide a demand response mechanism for electrical grids. Demand response, also known as “ancillary services” in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) marketplace in my home state of Texas, allows the grid operator to adjust electricity consumption during peak hours, preventing grid instability.  In December 2022, ERCOT reported that 96% of all large flexible loads (i.e. bitcoin miners) curtailed their energy consumption during a winter weather event that generated significant demand for electricity to heat homes. Nearly 2,000 megawatts of bitcoin mining came off the grid shaving off peak demand by that amount.  Further, by using energy during times of day and in locations where there is stranded energy, miners are able to significantly improve the economics for generators like wind, solar and natural gas plants. This improvement in economics for those generators helps ensure that generation resources (power plants, wind and solar farms) can expand their capacity.  This process shaves off the peaks of energy consumption and pulls up the troughs in times when energy demand is negligible (think overnight).  Brad Jones, the former ERCOT Interim CEO said it best when he stated at the 2022 Texas Blockchain Summit that, “bitcoin mining is a great thing to help us balance the grid. The bitcoin miners turn down their consumption when prices rise in a way that we can give that power back to other consumers.”     The nature of bitcoin mining operations requires miners to be located close to cheap energy sources. In many cases, these sources are renewable energy installations such as wind farms, hydroelectric power plants and solar arrays. By locating near these renewable energy sources, miners help stabilize the grid by absorbing excess electricity production that might otherwise be wasted.  Consequently, this reduces the need for grid operators to ramp up or down conventional power plants, thereby minimizing inefficiencies and promoting a greener energy mix.  Bitcoin mining is also spurring significant investment in renewable energy infrastructure. To remain competitive, miners continuously seek cheaper electricity rates, which often leads them to regions rich in renewable energy resources. By establishing mining operations in these areas, miners provide revenue streams that encourage further investments in renewable energy projects.  This phenomenon has been observed in several regions where the presence of mining operations helped to kick-start renewable energy projects that would otherwise not have been financially viable. The influx of capital from miners aids in expanding the capacity of renewable energy installations, ultimately contributing to a cleaner and more sustainable energy grid.  The energy-intensive nature of bitcoin mining has driven mining companies to seek energy-efficient solutions actively. As competition increases and energy costs rise, miners have a strong incentive to find innovative ways to reduce their electricity consumption without compromising their mining capabilities. And so, this has led to the development of more energy-efficient hardware and cooling systems.  See also: Bitcoin Is on the Ballot in 2024 | Mining Week  The decentralized nature of bitcoin mining can also incentivize grid decentralization efforts. By promoting distributed energy resources (DERs) like solar panels and home battery systems, bitcoin mining can facilitate grid independence and resilience. In times of natural disasters or other emergencies, these DERs can continue to operate autonomously, reducing the burden on the centralized grid and ensuring a stable energy supply.  By acting as a demand response mechanism, stabilizing the grid, spurring investments in renewable energy, driving technological innovation, and encouraging decentralization, bitcoin mining offers several benefits that promote sustainability and grid resilience.  It is essential to recognize that discussions about the environmental impact of bitcoin mining should not be limited to isolated observations but should consider the wider implications and opportunities for positive change. Through thoughtful regulation and promoting energy-efficient practices, the energy-intensive nature of bitcoin mining can be harnessed to bring about meaningful advancements in the global energy landscape.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION,Lee Bratcher,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/07/25/bitcoin-mining-has-a-superpower,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5ca4089ead11ecd023bcc3b8b848d92f3876ea12-1992x1120.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

But whether the app can keep up that momentum is unclear.  Threads seemed on track to challenge Twitter, the long-time microblogging incumbent that just rebranded to X. But how quickly things change on the internet: Despite its initial splash, various data sites now show Threads user activity has fallen as much as 70% from its first week. Average usage time has also dropped considerably in this time, from 21 minutes to six.  Meanwhile, the concept of decentralized social media has received an infusion of new interest, particularly in the wake of Twitter’s surprise rebrand.  So is Threads poised to take over Twitter — ahem, X — as the number-one microblogging site for crypto enthusiasts? We tapped some respected Web3 community builders and social media experts to find out their thoughts.  Beware: Threads isn’t actually decentralized yet  Threads parent company Meta promises that the new platforms will soon be decentralized, but some Web3 enthusiasts are skeptical. The platform announced plans to be compatible with the decentralized social media protocol ActivityPub, which would allow users to interact with other social media platforms like the open-source Mastodon network, Bluesky and others.  A future with interoperable, user-owned social media platforms would be a big deal. But critics aren’t convinced that Threads is the way. As of now, Threads users can only create accounts through existing Instagram credentials, which seems like a suspiciously convenient way to lock in user data.  Users also can’t interact entirely anonymously in the Threads multiverse, since their accounts are presumably always going to be linked with a Meta account requiring a legal name and date of birth (members of Crypto Twitter’s anonymous, aka “anon,” culture will most certainly curdle at the thought of “doxxing” themselves, or revealing their true identity, on a new platform.)  But despite the concerns, CoinDesk’s Emily Parker points out that most people outside of Crypto Twitter’s echo chambers care more about accessibility than privacy and decentralization. Anyone can easily pop their heads over into Threads to check out the vibes, no matter their technical ability. This ease of use has always proven most important when it comes to widespread adoption.  As for features, Threads’ are simple to use. Verified Instagram users will notice their existing verification carries over to Threads, and a thread (a post) can be cross-pollinated as an Instagram story. This intersite functionality makes it easy to reach more potential viewers with the same content.  Decentralization purists won’t like it, but perhaps this Meta-owned cross-posting functionality is the first necessary step toward building a truly open Web3. In a decentralized future, users will be able to move content and interact with peers across different apps built on the same underlying standards. What if Threads is training us for that kind of seamlessness?  “Personally, I'm rooting for a decentralized social [network] to succeed,” said Riley Blackwell, Web3-focused community-building strategist. Though Blackwell noted that she’s more in favor of Lens Protocol or Bluesky as Twitter alternatives than Threads, she nonetheless admitted that Threads will “undoubtedly capture the average [social media] user” who’s not as interested in learning about underlying protocols.  Threads responded to the zeitgeist — but so far, nothing else  Twitter has long been a target for disruption due to its often glitchy features and fire-stoking “free speech” guidelines that, according to those who left the platform, incite hate speech and bigotry.  In comparison, Threads seemed like a friendlier, less incendiary alternative: “I like that people are using Threads for different types of conversation,” said Blackwell.  However, it’s still unclear what the true value proposition of Threads is.  “Though Mark [Zuckerberg] and the Instagram team seem to have captured the hype with a new product, it feels like a missed opportunity,” Blackwell said. “I don't need a Twitter clone – I need Meta to think deeper about creating new ways to connect.”  More vocal critics argue that Threads not only devalues social connection but also commodifies it. Carrie Melissa Jones, author and online community strategist, said she first felt “hopeful” that Threads could replace the void she felt after leaving Twitter, but now thinks the app lacks the sense of camaraderie she felt in Twitter’s early days.  “I missed having a place for news, quick questions and silly conversations,” Jones said. “Meta can't duplicate that experience; their viral growth ambitions are stronger than their desire to build something with a distinct culture and purpose.  In a recent LinkedIn post, Jones summarized her critique succinctly, writing: “Mark Zuckerberg talks about community like it's a virus, most successful when it multiplies for no real purpose beyond its own existence.” Ouch.  And now Twitter, after announcing its rebrand to X, is receiving similar criticism from users who consider this move to be ego-driven.  The platform wars remind us to cultivate independent relationships  If anything, members of the Web3 community are using Threads with a scientist’s mind, an exploratory spirit that doesn’t rule any option out, but also doesn’t rely on a single platform either.  Rae Isla, an Americana singer-songwriter who used sales of her non-fungible token (NFT) collection, Rae Isla’s Rocks, to build an online fan community, remains appropriately skeptical of all centralized platforms. “Use the tools,” she posted. “Don’t let them use you.”  At the end of the day, Threads may replace X for members of the general public, but it probably won’t replace Crypto Twitter, which is composed of people who stay curious, value decentralization and collaborate on open-source protocols in the hopes of inching us towards a vision of a user-owned internet. Perhaps the next platform that lures us away from our glitchy Twitter Spaces and novel-length tweet threads won’t come from Meta, but rather from a handful of developers working in stealth mode right now.  To that end, maybe authentic relationships and meaningful connection will always be the most interoperable form of communication we have.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | TRADING,Megan DeMatteo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/07/25/is-it-finally-time-to-x-it-twitter-for-threads,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b867087bb3658232a6ce5d246b6a38a56f38a797-3599x2024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The world’s largest digital currency has also seen an increase in price in the past few months as a result of this, ranging around $30,000 for almost a month. Now, Fundstrat, an equity research firm based in New York City, has made a daring bullish prediction on the price of BTC. According to the investment research firm, the price of the cryptocurrency could reach $180,000 before its April 2024 halving. Fundstrat Makes Bullish Bitcoin Prediction In a Monday note to its clients, the firm put forward that BTC’s price could be on the verge of skyrocketing in the next year. A big part of their prediction revolves around the possibility of the trading of Spot Bitcoin ETFs by investment firms spearheaded by BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with over $9 trillion in assets. If approved, Spot Bitcoin ETFs could open the gates for mainstream investors and institutions to pour billions of dollars into Bitcoin. Related Reading: Elon Musk Incorporates Dogecoin Symbol In Twitter Bio, Triggering 5% Increase In Price The investment research firm said that the current daily demand for BTC currently at $25 million could skyrocket to $100 million with Spot Bitcoin ETFs. This would put bitcoin ETFs in direct rivalry with the market for precious metals ETFs, which currently has a total market capitalization of approximately $230 billion. “This [bitcoin ETF launch] would bring daily demand to $125 million, while daily supply is only $25 million. The implied equilibrium price would need to rise so daily supply matches daily demand,” Fundstrat said in the research note. Fundstrat’s head of digital asset strategy, Sean Farrell, also added: “We anticipate [a bitcoin ETF] would attract new investors and generate increased demand for bitcoin.” BTC price recovers slightly to $29,227 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Upcoming BTC Halving Another thing the research note mentions is the influence of the upcoming Bitcoin halving. Done once approximately every four years, the Bitcoin halving cuts in half the reward given to miners for mining a block on the blockchain. Past halvings have been known to reduce inflationary pressure on BTC, thereby steadily increasing its price. According to Fundstrat, the impending reduction of the daily mining incentive to $6 million from its current $12 million would result in a sizeable increase in the price of Bitcoin in order to achieve a state of equilibrium between buyers and sellers. The effect of the halving is then expected to compound with the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, leading to a greater price increase.

Coincidentally, Fundstrat is not the only firm anticipating BTC reaching the $100,000 mark in the near future.

MNTGE Patchwork features 13 unique digital patches designed by 11 artists including Jen Stark, Bored Ape Yacht Club artist Seneca and Nyan Cat meme creator Christopher Torres. The entire 7,500-unit collection will open for sale on July 27 on NFT marketplace OpenSea. Each NFT will be priced at 0.07 ETH, or $130, and the artwork will be revealed upon mint.  Each NFT is linked to an identical physical patch. Embedded with a near-field communication (NFC) chip, owners can scan the real-world patch to claim the digital token in their crypto wallet. By holding the patch on the blockchain and IRL, users can trace ownership as well as attend token-gated events and exclusive MNTGE experiences.  Additionally, the patches aren’t just one-off collectibles. In the physical world, they can be sewn onto MNTGE’s “base garments,” including t-shirts, jackets and denim. In the digital realm, the patches can be “owned” by the base garment itself. By implementing an ERC-6551 token standard, the digital wearable becomes a token-bound account that can custody the patches – creating an added layer of digital ownership.  Nick Adler, co-founder of MNTGE, told CoinDesk that the company was rooted in the goal of selling vintage fashion and utilizing the blockchain to revitalize its origins.  “People are out there wearing [vintage] and collecting it…young kids want to be authentic,” said Adler. “They don't want a Hot Topic shirt, they want the original shirt, right? So we just saw this natural, really honest use case for the blockchain, and we just felt like the two could really go hand in hand.”  Additionally, MNTGE says it wants buyers to express their digital identity through customization. Brennan Russo, co-founder of MNTGE, told CoinDesk that this characteristic is crucial to the brand, and placing garments on-chain helps facilitate this creative freedom.  “We've always consistently thought about how we bring customers into space,” said Russo. “From customizing denim from a physical standpoint to when we did our digital drop, really early on we allowed people to customize things – customization is really core to what we do and I think this is just doubling down on that.”  MNTGE, which debuted in 2022, has been dedicated to working between the intersection of digital and physical fashion by connecting their garments to the blockchain. In December 2022, the brand released the MNTGE Pass, an NFT that grants buyers first access to its drops. After quickly selling out its passes, it released its first collection of digitally-linked garments in February, created by designer and MNTGE co-founder Sean Wotherspoon.  Upon the release of the collection, MNTGE pass holders will be airdropped a MNTGE concert poster, created by design firm Globe Poster Printing.

42410124,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcTSTz,1690311823,Revenue Constraints Will Drive Bitcoin Mining to Sustainability,"While we have made great strides in shifting the narrative around Bitcoin’s bad environmental image (see this recent surprisingly optimistic report from Christian Stoll, Lena Klaaßen, Ulrich Gallersdörfer and Alexander Neumüller), we have to remember to stay balanced in our messaging.  Bitcoin mining alone won’t save the planet, but it is a valuable tool for managing some of the challenges of the energy transition. More important in the context of climate change is that bitcoin is essential for preserving freedom and liberty when growing climatic pressure to destabilize nations.  This story is part of CoinDesk's 2023 Mining Week, sponsored by Foundry. Margot Paez is a fellow at the Bitcoin Policy Institute, head of sustainability at Block Green and a sustainability and bitcoin mining consultant.  Let us start with what bitcoin mining will not be able to do. Bitcoin mining won’t push global warming past two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels all on its own. Bitcoin mining, based on CBECI estimates, accounts for roughly 0.14% of total global emissions. This is but a few drops in a bucket of greenhouse gas emissions.  In reality, even if we banned bitcoin mining today, humanity would still be well on track to surpass 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming in the next decade. Not only that but there is a good chance that the two degrees target will also be missed due to a lack of strong governmental action to reduce society’s reliance on fossil fuels.  Bitcoin mining will not be the sole catalyst that increases the rise in exponential growth in renewable energy. Nor will it push us over the finish line for meeting our decarbonization goals. At the Bitcoin Policy Institute, we are busy trying to quantify exactly what effect it will have, but we suspect that network dynamics being what they are, bitcoin’s role as a renewables catalyst will not always be equal in all scenarios.  We should not expect bitcoin mining to have the easiest time setting up on wasted gas sites like landfills, orphaned wells or oil and gas fields. There is way too much anecdotal evidence that suggests many of these wasted methane sites are well out of the reach of bitcoin miners. This means that we should not expect bitcoin miners to mitigate all methane emissions from landfills and the oil and gas industries.  I am not saying bitcoin miners cannot mine with wasted methane – there are several energy startups trying to do just this. But let us be clear, they are going to have a hard time surviving the tight profit margins that bitcoin miners face when the market is not in the middle of a bull run. They are going to need additional revenue streams if they want to stay viable in the long term.  Do not misunderstand me, bitcoin mining is doing good! It is agile, highly modular and has minimal requirements for uptime. Bitcoin has unique properties that make it good at supporting revenue for renewable energy projects right now. Miners active in demand response programs are helping minimize strain on the electrical grid during severe weather emergencies. There are bitcoin mining companies that are selling their waste heat to greenhouses or working on using it for municipal heating.  See also: Crypto Miners Are Pivoting to AI (Like Everyone Else) | Mining Week 2023  Some miners are mitigating methane emissions in the oil and gas industry and there are a few trying to prove the business case for landfill and agricultural waste gasses. The tighter the profit margins, the more inventive bitcoin miners will have to be. This means that mining revenue might end up being a secondary thought in a larger energy operation. Would it be so bad if mining becomes another boring tool in our clean energy operations?  After all, did we really expect Bitcoin to solve climate change with emissions reductions alone? Bitcoin’s greatest impact on climate change will not come from mining but from the network’s original raison d’etre.  Climate change will and is destabilizing society with its unpredictable but increasingly probable effects on our food production, water resources, and infrastructure. People often turn to the political strongman in times of deep uncertainty. If Bitcoin does save the planet, it will be through its preservation of economic liberty and with that, human rights.

According to a report by Reuters on July 25, the ICO has taken notice of WorldCoin’s launch in the UK and will now proceed to “making further inquiries.” Launched on Monday, Worldcoin is an Ethereum-based project founded by the CEO of OpenAI, Sam Altman. On the protocol’s official website, it states that Worldcoin aims to be “the world’s largest identity and financial public network.” To achieve its aim, the network utilizes a digital identification system known as “World ID,” designed to differentiate humans from artificial intelligence online. Interested Worldcoin users are required to undergo a physical iris scan process at one of the project’s “Orb” locations before being granted a WorldID, prompting much concern over the user’s privacy. Currently, there are three Worldcoin Orb locations in the UK, all of which are based in London.

Popular crypto lawyer John Deaton, along with many others, believes the process is a threat to users’ freedom and privacy, terming it as “Orwellian.” In addition, Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin also highlighted concerns about the World ID system. In a recent blog post, he stated that an iris scan is likely to reveal more information about users than originally designed. WLD Declines By 17% A Day After Launch Following the launch of Worldcoin on Monday, its native token, WLD, had an impressive debut in the market, rising by 88% and hitting a peak price of $3.31. However, the WLD token has since then recorded an overall negative price movement. Based on data from CoinMarketCap, WLD is currently down by 16.76% in the last 24 hours, trading as low as $1.92 within this period. According to Worldcoin’s whitepaper, WLD is primarily designed as a utility token for network governance. However, the token also serves as a payment medium for specific services in the World App or other crypto wallets.

With this new development, Bitcoin multisig wallets, known for their secure nature, are getting a significant upgrade. Multisignature or multisig wallets have always been a go-to for safeguarding funds on the Bitcoin network. Their modus operandi requires multiple signers to authorize any transaction, which adds a layer of security. But one of the limitations with traditional multisigs is that they can't add signers without creating a new wallet, an action that calls for transferring funds. The Solution The newly-introduced Frostsnap method proposes a solution to this inconvenience. It allows for the replacement of hardware wallets such as Ledgers, Trezors, ColdCards, or other similar permutations, without the need for additional on-chain transactions. It's also capable of adding new signers to a key after the initial private key generation event and rendering stolen hardware wallets incompatible with every other device of the multisig. Adam Mashrique, the project's hardware lead, affirmed the team's ambition to create an open standard that vendors could implement, thereby enabling different devices to be part of a FROST multisig wallet. Reshaping the Multisig Landscape Frostsnap has already drawn comparisons to a ""Bitcoin multisig centipede"" due to its flexibility and adaptability. Like a centipede, Frostsnap-compatible devices can be replaced, modify the required number of devices to confirm a transaction if a device is compromised, and efficiently facilitate data transfer to Bitcoin nodes with Taproot signatures. The name Frostsnap is a nod to the acronym Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold signatures (FROST). The remarkable aspect of this system is that it's fully in consensus with the Bitcoin network today, requiring no fork or proprietary node software. Despite plans to introduce a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) for on-chain FROST support, devices supporting FROST can manage an on-chain Frostsnap wallet today.

15288515,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=544290,1690311014,"Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Turns Red, US Institutions Disinterested?","Data shows the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap has turned negative recently, a sign that large US-based investors may be selling currently. Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap Has Remained Near Neutral For A While Now As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the interest from US investors in the asset has declined during the last couple of months. The indicator of interest here is the “Coinbase Premium Gap,” which keeps track of the difference between the Bitcoin price listed on Coinbase (USD pair) and that on Binance (USDT pair). The Coinbase exchange is popularly known to be used by US-based investors (especially large institutions), while the Binance platform has a more global audience. Thus, the Coinbase Premium Gap can provide us with hints about the buying or selling pressure differences between these two user bases. When the value of this indicator is positive, it means that the price listed on Coinbase is more than that on Binance. This suggests that American users are potentially participating in a higher amount of buying than global investors currently. On the other hand, negative values of the metric suggest the US-based holders may be doing a higher amount of selling than the worldwide users (or alternatively, they are just buying less of the asset). Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Rebound? This Metric May Be The One To Watch Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap over the last few months: The value of the metric seems to have been around the neutral line in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap has turned slightly red recently, implying that the price on Coinbase has become lesser than on Binance. This discount implies that the US-based institutional investors have been participating in a heavier amount of selling than the global users during the latest downward move in the cryptocurrency’s price. Even before this shift towards the small negative values, the indicator’s value had been mostly around the neutral mark during the last few months, meaning that American investors didn’t have any interest in accumulating the asset any more than the rest of the world. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sharks Continue Accumulation, But Whales Stagnate Back during the selloff in June, the US-based holders had even been applying notable selling pressure, as the metric’s value had been negative. This selloff was due to US-focused FUD from the SEC cases against Binance and Coinbase, so it makes sense that this side of the market was selling to a higher degree. Earlier during the year, though, the US institutional investors had seemed very much interested in the asset, as they had been participating in a high amount of accumulation, which had resulted in the metric turning highly positive. At present, however, it would appear that large American investors continue to be disinterested in Bitcoin, considering that the Premium Gap is still floating near the neutral line. This low level of interest could translate to further downward movement for the digital asset as it struggles to hold above $29,000.

A retracement higher may target its 20-day moving average.  Bitcoin’s price broke below its lower range of a widely watched technical indicator on Monday, a day before the Federal Reserve began its latest two-day, monetary policy meeting. Whether the two events represent anything other than a mild coincidence is another story.  The U.S. central bank will likely raise interest rates 25 basis points (bps) on Wednesday.  Anyone following crypto markets has likely noticed bitcoin’s diminished reaction to macroeconomic events. The two most recent rate hikes in May and March resulted in relatively mild price moves of 1.13% and -2.87%. The reaction to recent inflation and GDP data was similar, with BTC moving just -0.74% and 1.16% respectively, following each occurrence..  All told, crypto markets have likely priced in tomorrow’s anticipated move.  More interesting for traders is BTC’s price declining below the lower range of its Bollinger Bands, an indication that its price may be set to move higher – albeit just slightly. Bollinger Bands are a technical indicator that tracks an asset’s 20-day moving average, and plots price levels two standard deviations above and below the average.  As an asset’s price is expected to stay within two standard deviations of its average, 95% of the time, a breach of the external bands is seen as statistically significant.  For BTC, traders may be eyeing an upside target of $30,000 level, which coincides with bitcoin’s 20-day moving average. A high volume area of activity is also in place at $30,000, implying that a healthy dose of price agreement exists at this level. Prices tend to move slowly in periods of high volume, implying that BTC is poised to increase slightly, but will run into overhead resistance following an advance.  And given recent decreased volatility, and a narrowing trading range, that leaves just 3% upside between current prices and the 20-day average.  The aggregate spread between current BTC prices and its 20-day average is approximately $900, outside bitcoin’s current average true range (ATR) of $737. The implication is that even a 3% price increase to its 20-day average would mildly increase bitcoin volatility.  On-chain data does not suggest that prices will move sharply. According to analytics firm Glassnode, large crypto investors have continued to move their bitcoin from centralized exchanges.  While the trend may partly reflect a lack of confidence in centralized exchanges, bitcoin wallet balances have stayed fairly stable for both large and small investors, underscoring the current penchant for hodling and confidence in the asset.

42392946,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgE2ql,1690308433,Venture Capital Firm a16z Unloads $7M of MKR Tokens as Price Soars,"Venture capital heavyweight Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) is selling a part of its investment in crypto lender MakerDAO's MKR governance tokens as the price of coins soared to a near one-year high, blockchain data shows.  Some $7 million of MKR were transferred from a16z’s crypto wallet to a freshly created address late Thursday, according to Ethereum blockchain monitoring website Etherscan. The new wallet on Saturday then began depositing batches of 1,380 tokens – worth roughly $1.5 million – per day to crypto exchange Coinbase.  Sending tokens to an exchange usually signals intention to sell. Up through Tuesday, deposits from that wallet to Coinbase totaled $6.1 million, with the latest transaction occurring at Tuesday 14:18 UTC.  A representative of a16z did not immediately return a request for comment.  The transactions happened as MKR surged Friday to a near-one year high above $1,200 following the activation of a new token buyback scheme that is removing coins from the market, reducing their supply. The token pared some of its gains, sinking to as low as $1,040 on Monday, and has risen 10% since to its current $1,140.  MakerDAO is one of the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platforms and the issuer of the $4.6 billion stablecoin DAI. The platform is managed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), where MKR token holders – including a16z – can vote on governance proposals.  The venture capital firm was one of the largest investors in MakerDAO, purchasing 6% of MKR’s supply for $15 million in September 2018.  The protocol is currently undergoing a major overhaul spearheaded by founder Rune Christensen. The so-called Endgame Plan includes breaking up the protocol’s units into smaller, autonomous entities (SubDAOs) that could issue their own tokens.  In October, a16z opposed the plan to create new units arguing that the structure at the time was sufficiently decentralized. However, community members favored the changes in a governance vote.  After the transactions, a16z’s crypto wallets still hold 12,395 MKR – 1.3% of its circulating supply – worth $14 million, per blockchain forensics platform Arkham Intelligence’s data.",NEUTRAL,MKR,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MKR | TRADING | ARKM,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/25/venture-capital-firm-a16z-unloads-7m-of-mkr-tokens-as-price-soars,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b01fefd58032bdec90f2f49bb290535e3258e5e0-1304x710.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42392960,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgE3lB,1690306034,"DeFi Headed Toward a ‘Major Resurgence,’ Tribe Capital’s Boris Revsin Says","Decentralized finance (DeFi) projects flourished in the summer of 2020, enriched by bull market-driven cascades of venture capital funding and reaching a high of $248.84 billion in total value locked by the following fall. Crypto winter set in less than two years later, however, the chill increased by a number of industry-rocking scandals and hacks. Can DeFi now begin to recover some of its former glory?  Boris Revsin, managing partner of Tribe Capital, an investment firm with over $1.6 billion in assets under management, thinks it can as more infrastructure gets developed in more open markets outside the U.S., making it easier to create new projects.  “I expect DeFi to have a major resurgence towards the end of this year or early next year,” Revsin told CoinDesk during a recent interview.  Revsin expects a first wave of DeFi regulation in the U.S. later this year will push DeFi projects to operate in more open zones such as Dubai and Singapore. Infrastructure projects such as the layer 1 and layer 2 blockchains and rollup technology could continue to flourish in the U.S., however.  Revsin sees new infrastructure – and the developers behind the projects – as the keys to turning crypto into a $10 trillion industry. The current global cryptocurrency market capitalization stands at about $1.22 trillion, according to CoinGecko data.  The path to Tribe Capital  Revsin’s origin story began at age five when his parents arrived in the U.S. under chaotic conditions as Jewish refugees from Russia. “My parents are heroes,” says Revsin.  He grew up in a computer science household and spent a couple of years formally pursuing that path himself at the University of Massachusetts Amherst before dropping out to work as a programer for Mitt Romney’s first presidential campaign in 2008. Revsin then went on to co-found gamified marketing firm Dailybreak; VentureApp, the precursor to tenant engagement platform HqO; and Game Theory Group, an investment firm that backed early-stage blockchain companies and wrote and sold research reports.  In late 2018, the crowdfunding platform Republic acquired the team behind Game Theory Group and Revsin was brought on to head its new Republic Capital arm, which was distinct from the more consulting and builder-oriented Republic Crypto group. By the time Revsin left in April 2022, Republic Capital had raised more than $600 million, held about $1 billion in assets under management and had invested in more than 80 startups, including Avalanche, Polygon, Blockdaemon and Kraken.  But Revsin reached a point where he felt he had the experience and standing in the crypto ecosystem to move on to a fund with a larger brand and a multi-stage investment strategy with multi-asset funds across crypto and equity. He took a role at Tribe Capital as a managing partner overseeing the $96-million early-stage Tribe Crypto Fund I and its early-stage incubation project, as well as a partner on the firm’s approximately $400 million in equity investments.  Choosing investments  Founded in 2018 by Arjun Sethi, Jonathan Hsu and Ted Maidenberg, Tribe Capital has a data scientist-driven quantitative approach to startup evaluations. When considering a company for a potential investment, Tribe asks for as much quantitative data as possible from a startup, which is pushed through Tribe’s proprietary framework to produce a 60-page, color-coded report featuring key metrics for investors.  Tribe focuses on Series A to Series D investments, which tend to be more established but growing companies, and separately operates a pre-seed incubator that helps guide companies at the earliest stages of development. The firm wants to lead or co-lead on the rounds. Individual investments can go as small as $500,000 and as high as $5 to $7 million, noted Revsin.  Revsin said Tribe’s strongest operational support includes go-to-market advice for portfolio companies, and quantitative data about how a protocol and its existing competitors are performing.  Infrastructure is the future  Revsin said Tribe is most interested in investing in “products and protocols that become part of the developer stack.” That’s because ample developer tools lead to more projects and the potential for more Web2 users to migrate to Web3.  Developers have to make a wide range of infrastructure decisions, including which developer tools and layer 1 and 2 blockchains and oracle data solutions to use, explained Revsin. Developer usage provides a revenue stream for those infrastructure projects, who can use that capital to continue improving the products regardless of venture capital raises, and the improved products bring even more developers to the space.  “The world has changed in the last six years, and I think the next six years will usher in that massive developer group that we need in order to be a $10 trillion industry,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | MATIC,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/07/25/defi-headed-toward-a-major-resurgence-tribe-capitals-boris-revsin-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/215afd1ccaef7fcbfda4b18435bd7e1133d761fc-567x425.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Information Commissioner’s Office, responsible for upholding information rights and data privacy in the UK, conveyed to Reuters: ""We are aware of Worldcoin's launch in the UK and will be making further enquiries."" Worldcoin's distinctiveness lies in its innovative, orb-shaped cameras, or 'orb stations', which capture iris images to distinguish humans from AI online.

Worldcoin's Market Debut and Regulatory Challenges Renowned crypto platforms such as Binance, Huobi, and OKX have included Worldcoin (WLD) in their listings. On its launch day, WLD surged to a peak of $3.30. However, the initial euphoria proved short-lived as the token dipped more than 35%, dropping to $2.10 the following day. Despite launching in 35 cities across 20 countries on Monday, Worldcoin chose to steer clear of the US due to regulatory uncertainties and potential misuse of cryptocurrencies. In response to its digital ID and cryptocurrency's availability, Worldcoin expressed optimism, stating, ""We hope that in regions with unclear regulations, like the US, measures will be taken so more people can benefit.""

The raise will fuel the continued development of its maximum extractable value (MEV) network, SUAVE.  Investors in the round were “selected based on their reverse pitches in a beauty contest for decentralization,” according to the spokesperson. No other backers beyond Paradigm were named.  Flashbots is an Ethereum-centric research and development startup that aims to remove the negative impacts of maximal extractable value (MEV), the potential profit that network operators can extract by previewing or re-ordering upcoming blockchain transactions.  The SUAVE (Single Unifying Auction for Value Expression) platform is an independent network that can act as a mempool (essentially a transaction waiting room) and decentralized block builder. Developers can use SUAVE to launch intra-block applications such as block builders or orderflow auctions. Those applications can compete to execute user preferences, creating cheaper and more private transactions than those traditionally found on chains like Ethereum.  Flashbots also builds MEV-boost, a piece of MEV-optimizing middleware used by most of the validators that operate Ethereum.  The Block first reported on the funding round, citing a July 21 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that showed Flashbots had raised $30,353,089 of a $59,999,919 target. More filings are ""expected"" to become public soon that would ""likely"" complete the round, the Block said (an earlier version of its article was more specific and unequivocal, saying that there would be two such filings in coming days for the full amount and citing an unnamed source). The publication said the round carried a $1 billion valuation.

Something Fishy With Worldcoin? A video surfaced on Twitter in which Alex Blania, during a recent Bankless interview alongside fellow co-founder Sam Altman, refused to respond to the host’s question on Worldcoin’s token distribution, citing the regulatory uncertainty in the US as why he couldn’t answer the question. Related Reading: Binance Announces Listing Of Sam Altman’s Worldcoin, Opens Deposits The Twitter user (@Pledditor) posted the video with the caption: “When a crypto founder refuses to answer questions about token distribution🚩🚩🚩” In the video, the host asks Blania to explain the distribution of the WLD token and Blania is quoted as saying: “Look, many of the details we can’t talk about here for the regulatory uncertainty in the United States.” The video quickly went viral and sparked controversy as to whether Worldcoin was just another ‘ponzinomics’ or, indeed, Alex Blania was honest about why he couldn’t answer the question. However, renowned crypto lawyer John Deaton, who represents some XRP holders, quickly reacted to the video in a tweet. Deaton’s tweet read: Wtf did this dude just say? Did he literally say that he can’t talk about how WorldCoin is distributed “because of the regulatory uncertainty” in the United States? 🤦‍♂️ If there was ever a signal to RUN AWAY as fast as you can from a project, HERE IT IS. Is he saying he can’t tell you how to acquire it or what you’re acquiring because he might get sued? 🤷‍♂️ Now that I think of it, is he being smart and just following legal advice or is he a moron. 🤷‍♂️ Deaton stated that Blania’s action was enough reason for investors to run away from the project. However, the SEC and its Chair Gary Gensler weren’t spared from Deaton’s wrath as he also slammed them for their role in creating a state of turmoil regarding the regulatory environment in the crypto space. “But this is an example of the chaos caused when you have bad faith regulators like @GaryGensler intentionally keeping the regulatory environment as unknowable,” Deaton said. A Bad Start For WLD? This development comes less than 48 hours after the launch of Worldcoin’s highly-anticipated WLD token. There were, however, some positives for the token as leading crypto exchanges like Binance, Gate.io, and KuCoin were quick to list it upon launch. WLD price recovers above $2.2 | Source: WLDUSD on Tradingview.com Founded by OpenAI’s CEO Altman, Worldcoin aims to solve the problem of differentiating between humans and bot-related projects. This problem has stemmed from the growing use of artificial intelligence in almost all spheres of life. The team plans to resolve this by giving humans unique digital identities to differentiate them from artificial intelligence algorithms.

However, it seems the token’s price has negatively reacted to the issue of its token distribution and other privacy concerns as it dumped to as low as $1.66 on Monday, according to data from CoinGeko. WLD is currently trading at around $2.12 at the time of writing, with a 16% decrease in the last 24 hours.

42392949,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgE3GP,1690302611,Elon Musk’s Twitter Overhaul Could Be Huge for DOGE and Crypto Generally,"Elon Musk’s decision to change Twitter’s name to X and make it an “everything app” could broaden the use of dogecoin (DOGE), bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies.  “It would be an absolute game-changer to incorporate cryptocurrency payments as part of that ecosystem,” one expert said.  Elon Musk's brazen attempt to refashion Twitter into a new, broader service called X will apparently turn the iconic social-media app into a platform for making payments.  This dream, according to experts, probably has implications for cryptocurrencies, most specifically one of the billionaire's favorite playthings: dogecoin (DOGE).  Musk has long talked about creating a so-called everything app that incorporates not only social media and messaging but also the ability to buy things and send money. Crypto could easily factor into that, given Musk’s long history of dabbling in digital assets.  Read more: Dogecoin Bumps 10% on X Payments Speculation, DOGE Futures Traders Lose $10M  His carmaker, Tesla, holds bitcoin. He’s frequently talked about DOGE. “Dogecoin might be my fav cryptocurrency. It’s pretty cool,” he tweeted in 2019. Earlier this year, Twitter’s logo was for several days swapped out for dogecoin’s dog symbol, driving a huge (albeit temporary) DOGE rally. The token jumped this week on Monday after Twitter’s X rebranding.  “Elon clearly has an affinity for DOGE, almost as part of a running joke, but I wouldn’t be surprised if he actually went through with enabling payments via DOGE,” said Brian D. Evans, CEO and founder of BDE Ventures, a Web3 venture studio and advisory firm.  In January, the Financial Times reported that Musk had asked for payment infrastructure to be built at the company, initially for fiat currencies but with the ability to add crypto later.  Crypto going mainstream?  Crypto has never broken through to the mainstream, despite flirting with that status amid the bull market that ended in 2021. Musk has many detractors, so enabling payments via crypto on X is not guaranteed to move the needle on crypto adoption. However, X (née Twitter) still has millions of users, so it could broaden use.  “I suspect that he’ll incorporate other crypto assets such as bitcoin, ethereum along with stablecoins like USDC, but DOGE is such a part of Elon’s online presence that he would almost have to include a DOGE function were he to launch a crypto payments system on Twitter,” Evans said.  Musk’s vision for a platform called X goes years back to his time at PayPal, which got its name after the company merged with Peter Thiel and Max Levchin’s company Confitinity. Before the merge, its name was X.com – a URL Musk now owns and which redirects to twitter.com.  Twitter has already secured money transmitter licenses, which allows companies to receive and transfer funds, in three U.S. states – Michigan, Missouri and New Hampshire – as it quietly works on its payments tool.  “It’s clear that he’s keenly interested in turning the rebranded Twitter into something of a payments behemoth, and so it’s only natural that he would explore incorporating crypto in this functionality,” said Phillip Shoemaker, executive director of Identity.com, a non-profit organization providing decentralized identity verification. “If done correctly, Twitter could become the go-to platform for payments in general, whether they involve normie fintech applications or blockchains like Ethereum and Solana.”  A move into the crypto space wouldn’t be new for the app, which already partnered with Jack Mallers-led payments startup Strike in September 2021 to launch a bitcoin (BTC) tipping feature under former CEO Jack Dorsey.  “If we consider Musk’s vision for creating an everything app, it would be an absolute game-changer to incorporate cryptocurrency payments as part of that ecosystem,” said Raluca Cherciu, President of the Board at PairedWorld Foundation, an ecosystem that encourages social connectedness using tech-driven incentive mechanisms. “This not only resonates with the hugely active crypto community on Twitter, but also echoes Musk’s well-known fascination with the cryptosphere.”  See Also: Is It Finally Time to ‘X-it’ Twitter For Threads?

New Genkai NFT Collection and Game to Be Launched on Ronin According to the press release of July 25, Sky Mavis, creator of the popular crypto game Axie Infinity, starts its new partnership with a growing NFT franchise CyberKongz. CyberKongz will mint a part of its new anime-inspired NFT collection called Genkai on Sky Mavis’ Ronin chain. The Genkai mint will take place on July 27 at 12pm EST, with 4,000 made available on Ronin’s Mavis Market and the other 16,000 NFTs minted on the Ethereum Mainnet. The Ethereum NFT holders will have the option to move their tokens to Ronin in the future. The price for Genkai NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain is expected to be 0.25 ETH (about $460) per token. The NFT creators have also confirmed that they’ll join forces with Ronin to develop a new game featuring Genkai, although no further details have been announced so far. “Genkai is the first non-pixel artwork I have created for CyberKongz and will represent our growth as a project to expand our IP into the Southeast Asian and Japanese markets.

42392955,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgE3Vn,1690299493,How Bitcoin Miners Can Stay Clear of SEC Scrutiny (and Fall Foul of It),"You may be surprised to learn that the SEC’s ongoing efforts to rein in the crypto industry have been greeted warmly by at least some Bitcoiners. Because Bitcoin is firmly classed as a commodity rather than a security, those of a “Bitcoin maximalist” mindset have sometimes seen the crackdown as both a tactical and moral win. The laser-eyed set isn’t shy about sharing Gary Gensler’s skepticism of more centralized tokens like Solana, Cardano and even good old Ethereum.  This story is part of CoinDesk's 2023 Mining Week, sponsored by Foundry.  In broad strokes, Bitcoin and similarly structured proof-of-work tokens are commodities rather than securities because there is no central entity that collects capital in exchange for a promise of future returns. A proof-of-work chain like Bitcoin is purely a protocol, rather than a platform, product, or ecosystem – it’s a common enterprise, but you participate by following the rules, not by handing someone a sack of money behind the dumpster on Colesville Road.  So if you want to be in crypto but not at risk of catching an SEC stray, you probably want to hold Bitcoin. This has manifested as a fairly steady rise in “Bitcoin dominance,” or Bitcoin’s share of total crypto market value, over the course of the SEC’s 2023 legal adventures.  But that doesn’t mean bitcoin miners are completely free from SEC risk: in fact, it’s very easy to wrap commodity bitcoin in arrangements that are quite clearly securities contracts. In the wake of the recent split ruling in the SEC’s case against Ripple, this nuance may provide some timely insight into the relationship between a token in itself, and the agreements, transactions, and contracts surrounding it.  The shadows of 'cloud mining'  Recent crypto entrants may be surprised to learn that some of the earliest SEC actions on crypto, dating back at least as far as 2015, targeted Bitcoin miners – specifically, so-called “cloud miners.” The nominal goal of cloud miners was to offer colocation and management services to make mining easy, paralleling more general cloud providers like Amazon Web Services’ remote hosting.  Read more: Anthony Power - How Miners Are Preparing for the Next Bitcoin Halving  Unfortunately, many early cloud miners pursued flawed business models. Though they varied, a typical cloud mining contract would offer customers a particular amount of computing power (specifically, hashrate) for a set periodic cost. This appeared to amount to a security, since it implied a performance standard for the management of a pooled resource. But the model also invited fraud, which wound up being the more acute problem.  “The reputational shadow [of cloud mining] has been a stain on our entire industry,” says Kent Halliburton, President and COO of Sazmining, a hosted miner (for an explanation of the difference between hosted and cloud mining, see below). “Because so many people have gotten hurt and hosed. We said, if you’re selling hashrate, how are you not selling a security? We wanted to stay totally clear from it.”  The flaw of the cloud mining model, both from regulatory and trust standpoints, is that selling hashrate amounts to a guarantee of a specific output over time, reliant on the seller’s management expertise. There are also ample chances for deception and mismanagement: many cloud miners, maliciously or through incompetence, sold more hashrate than their machines could actually generate, and wound up effectively running ponzi schemes as they used new buyer funds to keep up.  Probably the most notorious cloud mining fraud was Josh Garza’s GAW mining, which was charged by the SEC in 2015. But cloud miners are still out there: an entity called Mining Capital Cloud Corp was hit with fraud charges in 2022.  Hosted mining – a safer path?  This legacy doesn’t imply all remote mining services are inherently securities.  “I think the structuring matters a lot there,” says Matt Walsh, partner at the Bitcoin-centric VC firm Castle Island. “What are you getting exposure to? A passthrough, or a direct physical machine?”  Castle Island is an investor in River Financial, one of the firms offering what’s known as “hosted mining” or “mining as a service” as an improvement on the flawed cloud mining model. Instead of selling hashrate, these firms sell specific, individual machines and charge monthly service fees for remote management. Sazmining and Compass also offer hosted mining services.  Among other features, hosted mining firms let customers monitor their individual machines in real time, seemingly leaving less room for either overcommitment or deception. Halliburton also says Sazmining sends block rewards directly to owners’ wallets, seemingly eliminating custody risk. Though they provide output estimates, returns vary according to network conditions.  Everything is a security (if you work hard enough)  These contrasts transfer to some other aspects of crypto and securities law. The distinction between cloud mining and hosted mining, for instance, is roughly parallel to the distinction between different models for offering third-party staking services for proof-of-stake systems. In February, Kraken paid a small SEC fine and agreed to shutter its staking service, but Coinbase has instead pledged to fight classification of its staking service as a securities offering.  Read more: Jeff Wilser - Crypto Miners Are Pivoting to AI (Like Everyone Else)  The difference, at least according to some analysts, is that Kraken engaged in more intermediary management in pursuit of better returns for customers, making its staking service effectively a risk-bearing yield product. Coinbase instead acted as a more direct conduit to on-chain staking systems, rather than engaging in any active management or strategy on behalf of customers.  The most extreme illustrative example of how to turn boring Bitcoin mining into the regulatory equivalent of radioactive waste may be Celsius, the fraudulent crypto “bank.” While positioning itself as safe, Celsius was actually engaged in highly risky speculation on a chaotic mishmash of assets and ideas. One of those, it turns out, was a small mining operation in Texas that was sold off after Celsius’ bankruptcy.  While it was just one small part of Celsius’ business model (wildly reckless and utterly disorganized speculation), the mining operation was implicated in SEC claims that Celsius violated securities law. Leaving aside Celsius’ fraudulent nature, a depositor in a crypto fund that received returns driven by a mining operation they don’t manage is clearly handing over money in expectation of a return created by the efforts of a third party.

However, in a recent development, the Bahamas payment company, Island Pay, is now incorporating cryptocurrency for remittance transactions to make it a smoother and cheaper process. Island Pay is set to introduce crypto wallets that utilize the stablecoin USDC as the medium of exchange. The payment firm plans to roll out the CiNKO wallet in more than 30 countries. The wallet which caters to users in the Caribbean and LATAM regions will enable individuals to conduct transactions with vendors, make payments to others (including those without bank accounts), and fund pre-paid cards. Island Pay CEO Richard Douglas stated: Our goal is to continuously look for ways to advance financial inclusion in the region and enhance financial experiences for both the unbanked and banked populations. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Rebound? This Metric May Be The One To Watch Crypto Revolutionizes Remittance Landscape, Advancing Financial Inclusion By integrating crypto for remittance, Island Pay demonstrates its commitment to fostering financial inclusion and enriching monetary experiences for both banked and unbanked individuals in the region. The incorporation of this technology will lead to significant reductions in international money transfer fees. When receiving USDC stablecoins on CiNKO, users will not be charged. They may, however, encounter gas fees, depending on the blockchain network used for the transaction. The demand for crypto transactions has surged due to the existing challenges in conventional remittance methods. According to the World Bank, the average cost of sending $200 can be as high as 6.2%. Additionally, these transactions often take several days to process through traditional financial intermediaries. As pointed out in Circle’s recent report, the technology has the potential to slash the cost of sending money abroad by a substantial 80%. This report predicts that Blockchain’s capacity to enhance cost savings for financial institutions engaged in cross-border transactions will reach a market cap of $10 billion by the year 2030. Even before this, the Bahamas boasted a well-established presence in the fintech sector, with various global payment platforms and crypto wallets operating in the region. Rifos disclosed that the remittance and payments sectors are currently the fastest-growing fintech segments in LATAM. The surge in smartphone adoption and connectivity has also played a crucial role in fostering innovation and advancements in these areas.

15282848,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4619516-chainlink-blockchain-oracle-finance?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1690297253,Chainlink: The Blockchain Oracle Of Finance,"Summary Chainlink is a crypto Oracle that connects blockchains with off-chain data. It is a crucial protocol for DeFi to properly function. With the recent release of CCIP, Chainlink will be integrated with traditional financial institutions via SWIFT. However, there are notable concerns about whether or not Chainlink's multisig contract is secure enough. One of the biggest problems in the broader public blockchain landscape is interoperability. Since public blockchains don't generally access off-chain data, for ecosystems like DeFi to properly function, data Oracles like Chainlink (LINK-USD) have become very important components of the crypto ecosystem. In this article, we'll explore what Chainlink does, the economics of the token, and what the newly released Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol, or CCIP, enables. What is Chainlink? Primarily developed by Chainlink Labs, Chainlink is a smart contract oracle that connects blockchain networks and applications. It was founded by Sergey Nazarov in 2017 and currently has over 2000 integrations that vary between DeFi, NFTs, Web3 gaming, and proof of reserves. Chainlink aims to be a decentralized network as it allows for thousands of independent node operators. There are currently 86 such operators, one of the more notable non-crypto native node operators is T-Systems (TMUS). The rationale behind decentralizing the nodes is that it eliminates the single point of failure potential that comes with utilizing a more centralized single node oracle. Node Setup (Chainlink) Beyond nodes, Chainlink is already being utilized by Google ( GOOG ) (GOOGL), AccuWeather, and the Associated Press among other non-crypto focused entities. All Blockchains (Chainlink) What makes Chainlink such an important Oracle to the entire crypto market is the fact that it's a chain-agnostic network. It can link any input to any blockchain. With the proliferation of so many layer one blockchains, the ecosystem has clear fragmentation concerns. Interoperability networks like Chainlink aim to address the fragmentation problem and provide real-time pricing data throughout the market. SWIFT and CCIP More recently, traditional finance, or ""TradFi,"" can now utilize Chainlink as well through an integration with the SWIFT system . This integration will bring roughly a dozen TradFi institutions to the Chainlink network. Those TradFi institutions include Citigroup ( C ), The Bank of New York Mellon ( BK ), and Lloyds Banking Group ( LYG ) among others. According to SWIFT, the ability to use public ledger networks rather than building out their own networks is an attractive selling point for several TradFi businesses: Instead of building new infrastructure and technology stacks entirely from scratch, financial institutions want to leverage their existing infrastructure to connect to blockchain ledgers, where tokens are recorded in a way that is both compliant and secure. Not only would this help firms simplify their architecture and operations, but it also minimizes investment costs and reduces risk of technology obsolescence. According to SWIFT, there is an increasing interest from traditional firms in tokenized assets. Which is something that Larry Fink seemed to corroborate during a recent interview on cable TV. Given the network fragmentation problem mentioned in the previous section, Chainlink is well-positioned to garner interest from non-crypto native firms as it can abstract away network layers. Cross-chain messaging (Chainlink) Chainlink's recent release of CCIP appears to be a major step forward in blockchain interoperability. In addition to being able to transmit messages from one chain to another, CCIP allows application developers to build on top of Chainlink rather than picking an individual blockchain network. So far, the networks that are supported are Ethereum (ETH-USD), Optimism (OP-USD), Avalanche (AVAX-USD), Arbitrum (ARB-USD), and Polygon (MATIC-USD). Tokenomics Underpinning all of this is the LINK token. LINK is used to pay for data requests on the oracle network. Given the amount of projects currently integrated with Chainlink, it's not too surprising to see over 635k individual holders of the token. Total Token Supply: 1.0 billion. Circulating Supply: 538 million (54%). Token Price: $7.55. Market capitalization: $4.0 billion. Fully diluted cap: $7.5 billion. Market Cap Rank: 20. Addresses: 635.8k. There is a bit of whale concentration with the token distribution through retail holdings have grown over the last few years: LINK Concentration (IntoTheBlock) Despite no single wallet address holding more than 3% of the total LINK supply, there are 21 whale wallets that account for 55% of the total coin supply. However, this is down from about 75% in early 2019; indicating retail holders are increasing share of LINK token holdings. While LINK is unlikely to achieve the level of address decentralization observed in something like Bitcoin, these wallet concentration figures are an improvement over some of the other top coins in the crypto market. According to Crunchbase , core developer Chainlink Labs raised $32 million through a 2017 ICO and 3 additional rounds. The ICO money came from 9 entities, none of which I consider to be the standard crypto investment firms that we generally come across like a16z, Coinbase Ventures, or Pantera Capital. Chainlink's early investors include: Nirvana Capital, TGE Capital, AlphaCoin Fund, FJ Syndicates, and Fundamental Labs. In my opinion, these are less ""loud"" firms from China, Australia, and the US. 35% of the total coin supply was sold to investors during a 2017 token sale. An additional 35% is reserved for node operators and the remaining 30% stayed with Chainlink Labs. LINK Allocation (Messari) Market cap rank-wise, 20 could actually be considered to be a fairly modest level given how important to the entire financial market ecosystem Chainlink could ultimately become if it is adopted as the blockchain oracle of choice by TradFi firms. Another possible key to that potential is that Chainlink can serve as a proof of reserve for off-chain assets in addition to on-chain smart contract assets. Public blockchains can't interact with off-chain data sources independently so Chainlink does address a legitimate problem. Risks Despite the encouraging ruling in the Ripple Labs case recently, the regulatory environment in the United States is still a clear uncertainty for the crypto market. Having conducted an ICO in 2017, Chainlink Labs could come under regulatory scrutiny in the future. Since the company is the holder of LINK tokens, any negative ruling against Chainlink Labs in future litigation could potentially depress the price of LINK tokens if the company sells a large amount. Another potential concern for Chainlink at the network level, if not most of DeFi, is the theoretical centralization concern of its multisig. In a critique of Aave ( AAVE-USD ) late last year, crypto analyst Chris Blec pointed out the potential flaw in relying on Chainlink's oracle due to the structure of the smart contract: This is highly concerning for multiple reasons, the most severe of which being that Chainlink, itself, is entirely controlled by a 4-of-9 multisig contract Blec points out that if the multisig keys become compromised or if the holders of those keys decide to go ""rogue,"" it could be highly detrimental to Chainlink's security and by extension the security of DeFi. Summary In my view, Chainlink is a very important protocol for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. The coin price has rallied from the $6 range to over $8 in recent weeks. This spike in price is no doubt in reaction to the release of CCIP and SWIFT integration. The latter of which is likely a sign that we'll see engagement growth between traditional financial firms and public blockchain networks. Chainlink can serve as an important protocol for proof of reserves. With the well-documented blowups of centralized crypto firms like FTX and Celsius, there is likely growing demand for easily verifiable off-chain data. When I examine coins and tokens in the cryptocurrency market, I generally try to find assets that can either achieve a network adoption of some sort, solve problems plaguing other networks, or that make people's lives easier. Chainlink sort of does all three because the network can scale thousands of independent node operators, connect blockchains to data that can't be accessed natively, and allows for network layer abstraction at the user level. Chainlink isn't an exciting L1 trying to be an ""ETH killer."" It's an oracle. But it just has to be somewhat boring and work properly. I think it's worth a long in crypto winter.",POSITIVE,ICO | LINK,BLOCKCHAIN | ICO | LINK | MARKET | TOKEN SALE,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4619516-chainlink-blockchain-oracle-finance?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/15282848.jpeg

42392963,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgE4Ap,1690296881,Riot Platforms at the Heart of Texas' Debate Over Bitcoin Mining’s Effect on the Grid,"Texas is the largest power producer in the U.S., home to large amounts of both fossil fuel and renewable energy generation. It is also one of the world’s foremost bitcoin mining hubs, with about 1.5 gigawatts (GW) of mining as of August 2022.  These attributes make it a good place to experiment with the integration of bitcoin mining into power grids. The local grid operator, the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas, has been using economic incentives to align miners’ interests with those of the public.  This story is part of CoinDesk's 2023 Mining Week, sponsored by Foundry.  However, these incentives, which come in the form of various demand response programs, have come under fire from local residents and legislators. They say the state is subsidizing an industry that is harmful to the environment and local communities.  Riot Platforms (RIOT), one of the largest bitcoin miners in the world, is at the heart of these debates. Riot saved $27 million in 2022 for not mining bitcoin under demand response programs, which allow large energy consumers to power off when the electric grid is facing demand surges in exchange for credits for later use.  Looking to cap the mining industry’s participation in such programs to 10%, Texas legislators recently proposed Bill SB 1751, which initially passed the State Senate. But it failed to make it through a House committee in May.  Read more: Jeff Wilser - How Texas Became a Global Mecca for Bitcoin Mining  Riot is developing two sites in Texas, in Navarro and Milam counties, with a total energy capacity of 1.7 gigawatts (GW). The Navarro site will be the biggest bitcoin mine in the world, the company claims.  One megawatt of power can normally power about 1,000 homes in the U.S., but only 200 Texas residences during the summer, according to ERCOT (the need for AC is that steep). If completed, Riot’s sites would consume enough energy to power 340,000 Texan homes in the high demand season.  Subsidies?  For local resident Jackie Sawicky, Riot is taking advantage of state incentives for its own profit, leaving citizens to foot the bill.  Read more: Can Crypto Miners Make the World Greener?  Sawicky founded and leads the group Concerned Citizens of Navarro County – which is made up of 700 local residents – and participates in advocacy group National Coalition Against Cryptomining, which is active in six states. The Navarro group has dug into filings to try to pinpoint the firm’s impact on the community and environment.  “If Riot wasn't underwritten and subsidized by Texas taxpayers and those of us who actually pay our bills, would they even still be in business?” Sawicky asked, pointing to $509.6 million in losses the firm reported in 2022. About 95% of the losses were due to impairments in assets, filings show.  When energy demand and prices spike, the cost of the energy outweighs the price of Riot staying in operation, so “they're going to shut down anyway,” Sawicky said. Her argument was echoed by State Senator Lois Kolkhorst, who sponsored the mining cap bill, and environmental advocates at the bill hearing.  Grid support  But that’s not a universal view. Marathon Holdings (MARA) CEO Fred Thiel thinks miners are actually contributing to grid development and stability.  “Most people don't understand that bitcoin miners act as great load balancers and are very complementary to the grid in Texas. They actually provide financial incentives for more renewable energy to be developed,” he said in an interview with CoinDesk.  When demand for energy is low, bitcoin miners can act as a base load of consumption that will keep money flowing into wind and solar energy producers, making their operations profitable enough that they can grow more, proponents such as the TBC argue.  This is particularly important for renewable energy, which can produce big spikes in supply at times when there is little demand (e.g. when the wind is blowing overnight driving turbines). When demand spikes, miners can easily power off, unlike other industrial facilities where constant energy is required.  Read more: George Kaloudis - Through It All, the Bitcoin Mining Industry Looks Set for Growth  Producers participating in ERCOT’s demand response programs are supposed to ramp down only if grid managers have told them to. And some non-miners have been accused of following their own timetables, causing unnecessary electricity price rises.  “You really need to look into all the demand response programs, especially certain types of demand response services” because often, they power off early, before they are called on to shut down by ERCOT and prices have spiked, said Jason Cox, an energy consultant who works with Riot and and other miners through Priority Power Management.  Tax incentives  The residents’ group also accuse the miners of failing to make sufficient tax and community contributions.  Riot noted a deferred tax benefit of $11.7 million in taxes in 2022, primarily due to changes in contingent consideration liability. The firm pays 100% of its local sales tax, it said, but is exempt from this duty on a state level, along with other data centers.  Sawicky claims that Riot saves $200 million in property tax for its Milam county site, based on public records that she has requested from authorities. Riot declined to specify how much property tax it pays, but said it’s 100% of the ad valorem property tax as set by the school district in Navarro county (assessed by the value of its investment in the area).  The company has neither received nor requested any tax abatements from Navarro county, said Navarro County Director of Economic Development John Boswell.  Riot “works with our local governments to structure tax incentives that are mutually beneficial” to both parties, the firm said.  Employment contributions  More than tax revenue, bitcoin miners bring precious jobs to underdeveloped communities, the industry argues. Riot is the top employer in Milam county and number one taxpayer in its school district, according to the firm. The county could not independently confirm this claim.  Sawicky thinks the employment footprint is miniscule.  Riot will bring up to 400 jobs to Navarro, once it is fully operational, and the expansion of the tax base will be beneficial to the county, Boswell said. “We see this as a very clean, good project with good jobs,” with good wages and benefits, he said.  The firm told CoinDesk it will bring “250 full-time, high-wage jobs” in Navarro county and has already provided 300 jobs in Milam.  These contributions are minimal, said Sawicky, pointing to the TBC’s own testimony on the bill. The industry employs only 2,000 people in Texas, said the lobbying group’s president Lee Bratcher. Out of 30 million Texans, “that's not even half of 1%,” Sawicky said.  “These places set up shop in poor, depressed areas and they promise jobs and tax revenue,” only to drive up electricity costs, Sawicky said.  The average hourly wage in Navarro is $19, a third less than the national average. Riot did not respond to CoinDesk’s question about the wages it pays.  Demand and supply  At a bill hearing, Senator Kolkhorst cited a report claiming electricity bills grew by $300 when miners’ set up in New York’s Plattsburgh. The New York Times said in an article that bills have increased 5% per year in 10 mines it studied. When miners cluster in an area, critics claim, demand and prices for electricity rise.  Industry proponents argue that miners can actually improve the profitability and stability of the grid because they can turn on and off at a moment’s notice.  Read more: After Short-Lived Ban, City in Upstate NY Is Still Reckoning With Crypto Miners  Energy adviser Cox disagrees with the argument that miners drive up electricity bills. Miners “actually use power when there's way more renewable energy on the grid,” he said.  That can actually improve generators' economics, Cox said. Without this consumption at those times, renewable energy producers might have to reduce output or turn off to mitigate congestion, a practice known as “curtailment.” By consuming when no one else wants to, and not consuming when prices are high, miners reduce curtailment while reducing the cost of meeting peak demand.  Recent peer-reviewed research led by Texas A&M University found that bitcoin mining can provide load flexibility that “could potentially avoid all reliability concerns without major economic loss,” while the price responsiveness of bitcoin miners can “mitigate market disruptions.”  The Navarro citizens also take issue with how Riot set up their site in a residential neighborhood, Sawicky said. None of the residents were informed or consulted ahead of construction, she said.  Communications between Boswell and Riot’s former CEO Chad Harris show the company was concerned about publicizing their activity. To Boswell, this is standard practice for a company looking to keep its location planning confidential.  Environmental concerns  On top of all the concerns about miners’ impact on the grid and local communities lie environmental issues.  Even if Riot uses 100% renewable energy, “we will never divest from fossil fuels, we will never transition to renewables as long as the bitcoin blockchain is being used at scale,” because its hashrate and therefore energy consumption is consistently growing by design, and therefore drawing away power from other users, Sawicky said.  The project could use at least 1.5 million gallons of water a day, according to records Sawicky requested. The county has faced “extreme drought” in the past year, so water is a precious resource.  Economic director Boswell said the county can meet Riot’s needs while satisfying local residents as well.  Riot declined to specify how much water it requires, but said that “the volume is consistent with similarly sized businesses with similar employee/contractor bases.”  Sawicky, a self-proclaimed hippie and environmentalist, remains unconvinced. She argues that bitcoin is a vehicle for fraud and crime and that its electricity use is ultimately wasteful. Riot and Boswell are just “guessing and throwing away numbers,” she repeatedly told CoinDesk.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/07/25/riot-platforms-at-the-heart-of-a-texas-debate-over-bitcoin-minings-effect-on-the-grid,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d118efe7df1f6be3c796f4d1777f7ed1344a5385-1599x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42392961,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgE3vR,1690296708,"Overheard at EthCC — Is Crypto Back, Boosted by Artificial Intelligence?","Paris, FRANCE — With more than double the attendees compared to last year’s event, over 250 side events and pretty much every event and side event oversubscribed, the mood at last week’s EthCC was elated, leaving attendees at the Ethereum-focused conference to wonder whether the worst of the bear market is in the past.  The breezy summer weather and blue skies of Paris didn’t hurt, nor did the jolt of positive sentiment from Ripple’s recent partial win in its case against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – a catalyst for price rallies not only in the related XRP token but other altcoins, including ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain. The past few weeks have also seen announcements of applications for bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETF) from some of the world’s largest asset managers – not really related to the Ethereum blockchain per se, but an important and encouraging development for the digital-asset sector.  Another hot topic at the event was the rise of artificial intelligence or AI, with multiple talks and side events organized on the topic.  Most investors and founders I spoke to were bullish on the intersection of the two fields — even though they disagreed on exactly how they should intersect.  AI in Web 3 Finance  One camp sees the more immediate, practical applications of AI into crypto markets and communities as the best use case. For example, Ken Timsit from Cronos Labs, the Layer 1 blockchain of exchange Crypto.com, sees AI as a tool to increase productivity in crypto financial markets, increasing the dollar value of funds managed by crypto firms.  This might look a little like throwing chatbots onto exchanges right now, but fundamentally bringing analytical capabilities to crypto traders and institutions could end up being a powerful force. High-frequency trading houses and market makers have been using AI for a while now, but their edge is often in in-house technology.  Along these lines is Upshot, which uses AI to price non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and they’ve been at it for the past three years. In their view, NFTs are the rails on which trillions of dollars of assets can be brought into Web 3, such as art, luxury goods, insurance and eventually real estate. But these non-fungible assets need a lot of human power to keep rolling. AI could be the answer to figuring out pricing mechanisms and how to clear markets.  Cryptography for Better AI  One of the buzzwords of crypto development for the past year have been zero-knowledge proofs (ZK), a type of cryptographic process that can verify the validity of a statement without revealing any other information about the statement itself.  ZK could be applied to machine learning to verify what model has been used to yield a given result in a mashup known as ZKML, or perhaps what datasets were used in the training of data. Essentially, blockchain could create a decentralized trust system for AI.  Read more: Axiom’s Zero-Knowledge Proofs Might One Day Help Detect Deepfakes  According to Eli Ben-Sasson Co-Founder and President of StarkWare, and a major figure in the development of ZKs, blockchains are especially good at social coordination, and ZKs are a privacy technology, which is not necessarily what machine learning needs.  One venture capitalist said that the best use case for blockchain is keeping track of the data used in training AI systems. That’s an incredibly demanding computational task. Keeping track of what the algorithms are doing is another crucial task, perhaps even more important.  A key bottleneck is computing power, performance, and usability of ZK proofs, which remain relatively slow. Companies like Manta Network and Fabric Cryptography are working on these problems.  Other projects are using blockchains to bring together and coordinate computational power that could then be used to train and run machine-learning models.  All good fodder for discussions in Paris over croissants and champagne in rooftops with Eiffel Tower views.  Exactly what use cases come from all this remain to be seen.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/07/25/overheard-at-ethcc-is-crypto-back-boosted-by-artificial-intelligence,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/be8eae46bf16ff0a2d991dc3d08b5293c5708d89-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The program called Avalanche Vista aims to bring more digital versions of traditional investment products, including equities, credit, real estate and commodities to the layer 1 blockchain.  Tokenization is one of crypto’s hottest trends this year, as traditional finance (TradFi) mainstays such as Franklin Templeton, as well as crypto native firms, offer more old-school financial assets – often tagged as real-world assets (RWA) in crypto jargon – like government bonds in the form of a blockchain-based token.

It is the country's first bill setting out how crypto should be treated, and was passed by the National Assembly last month.  It was put into the Gazette of the Republic of Namibia on Friday, meaning it's now law. However, it's ""not yet effective,"" said Diana Vivo, an associate at the law firm Ellis Shilengudwa Incorporated, a part of DLA Piper Africa.  ""[It] will only become effective on a date to be determined by the Minister of Finance of Namibia,"" she told CoinDesk.  Nations around the world, like the European Union, U.K. and South Korea are amping up their regulation of crypto related activities. South Africa recently opened up a crypto licensing regime.

What Has Happened With Ripple’s Sales? Compared to 2022, Ripple sold 37% more XRP per month in 2023, and a recent tweet by Mr. Huber, an influencer in the XRP community, drew many’s attention to this development. Related Reading: Elon Musk Incorporates Dogecoin Symbol In Twitter Bio, Triggering 5% Increase In Price “Ripple sold 2.22 billion XRP since 2023 started. That’s about 315 million per month. About 50% more than the usual 200 million in 2022. Now the crying is about to start. But I can reassure you. It is not XRP Tards who have bought these 2.2 billion XRP and XRP has outperformed anyway. No matter what you feel,” Huber said. It is important to mention that Mr. Huber initially made a mistake regarding the percentage increase in monthly sales from last year, which stands at 37% against the 50% he initially tweeted. He, however, quickly corrected it in a follow-up tweet. Despite this, 37% remains a lot, and these figures will undoubtedly raise eyebrows about what is going on with Ripple and how XRP’s price will react to these sales, whether it will bring about a massive rise in XRP’s price or a steady decline. XRP’s circulation does justice to these claims, as the number of XRPs in circulation has grown exponentially. XRP’s circulating supply was 50.334 billion at the beginning of the year but now stands at 52.554 billion after Ripple’s sales and monthly escrow releases. That is an additional 2.2 billion XRPs put in circulation since January and a 4.4% increase, and the year is far from over. In 2021, Ripple sold 2 billion XRPs, amounting to 166 million XRPs being sold on an average monthly basis. In 2022, it sold 2.75 billion XRPs, an average of 230 million tokens sold monthly. XRP holding steady above $0.7 | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com In 2023, Ripple has sold 2.22 billion XRPs since the start of the year, amounting to an average of 315 million tokens sold monthly since January. That proves that Ripple has increased XRP sales massively since 2021. What Does This Mean For Ripple And Its Community? These figures could be both good and bad news for XRP and its community. On the positive side, it shows that there has been a greater demand for the token over the years, which signifies growth and wider adoption of the token. This demand may mainly be coming from institutional investors, which could undoubtedly expand the use cases of XRP beyond the cryptocurrency space. While on the negative side, having so much XRP in circulation without a deflationary mechanism could reduce the token’s value.

The market value of Tradecurve (TCRV) is projected to soar by 80x in 2023. On the contrary, Neo (NEO) and Polkadot (DOT) are witnessing an erosion in their investor base. Therefore, Tradecurve’s presale has become a huge hit from the very first day of its launch due to its stable and growth-bound business roadmap. >>Register For The Tradecurve Presale Neo (NEO) Launches Neo Compounder Neo (NEO) has recently taken measures to expand its universe, and protect its price from falling. The price of Neo (NEO) has been on a free fall for the last few weeks, and has plummeted by 10% in the past 7 days. As a result, the trading price of Neo (NEO) has come down to $10.82, which is about 95% below its peak price of $196.85. To break this bearish momentum, Neo (NEO) recently announced that Neo Compounder has been made live. According to the project developers, Neo Compounder will auto-compound users’ GAS rewards into more NEO tokens. Analysts believe that this development will incentivize users to increase their activity on the Neo (NEO) network. This, in turn, can help the Neo (NEO) network register a positive growth rate in the coming weeks. Polkadot (DOT) Tops GitHub Commit Rankings Polkadot (DOT) recently bagged the top spot in GitHub commit rankings. According to data from Santiment, Polkadot was ranked first in the list of the top 20 fastest-developed crypto assets. The top position on the list indicates that the level of development activity on the Polkadot network has been higher than other blockchains. As per experts, high development activity can boost investors’ confidence in the Polkadotnetwork, as it hints about an upcoming surge in the value of DOT tokens. In another event, the social network, MeWe, recently integrated with the Polkadot ecosystem. This can also increase the user base of Polkadot. Currently, Polkadot is trading at $5.91, after suffering a fall of 7% in the last week. >>Register For The Tradecurve Presale Tradecurve (TCRV) Eyes Big Jump During Presale The ecosystem and dominance of the crypto market are expanding at a fast pace.

The previous token unlock on June 30 resulted in a 10.7% sell-off across all OP trading pairs, although the token rebounded by more than 15% over the following 24 hours.

42392943,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgE2ld,1690293940,Bitcoin Is on the Ballot in 2024,"For the first time in history, Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency community at large could play a pivotal role in a U.S. presidential election. Although November 2024 is over a year away, campaigns are already in full swing and, like it or not, Bitcoin is on the ballot. The fact that many candidates feel compelled to take a stance on “crypto” is a testament to the uniqueness of the moment.  On the Republican side, several major candidates – Governor Ron DeSantis, Mayor Francis Suarez, and Vivek Ramaswamy – are proponents of Bitcoin, celebrating the technology’s tenets of freedom, privacy and decentralization. DeSantis has also come out against a U.S. central bank digital currency (or “digital dollar”), signaling his commitment to decentralization and data privacy.  This story is part of CoinDesk's 2023 Mining Week, sponsored by Foundry. Kyle Schneps is the director of public policy at Foundry.  For the Democrats, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. pledged to support the rights of all Americans to use, custody and mine Bitcoin without undue prejudicial government scrutiny. And, while Elizabeth Warren has vowed to build an “anti-crypto army,” she at least knows that crypto is a topic to be reckoned with, albeit in a negative sense.  Even former President Donald J. Trump – the Republican frontrunner and longtime Bitcoin skeptic – remains uncharacteristically silent on the issue. Clearly, a political shift is underway, begging the question: If Bitcoin was a non-factor in previous general elections, why is this time different?  Indeed, the growth of the crypto industry and the sheer number of investors in the United States is reaching levels hard to ignore. The U.S. Federal Reserve estimates that 8%-11% of Americans – certainly enough to sway an election – own cryptocurrencies depending on the relative timing of the bull/bear market cycle. This number will likely increase dramatically given the recent pivot by BlackRock, Vanguard and other major financial institutions to invest in Bitcoin (BlackRock recently applied to the SEC to form a Bitcoin ETF, long seen as a key vehicle for more mainstream acceptance).  Read more: Anthony Power - How Miners Are Preparing for the Next Bitcoin Halving  Moreover, according to a Plaid survey, 46% of Black Americans and 44% of Hispanic Americans view cryptocurrencies as more accessible than the traditional financial sector. Comparative data from the Fed and Pew Research Center confirm that crypto investment is the only asset class where Black and Hispanic voters outpace White Americans per capita. These are key electoral demographics for a presidential election, especially when we consider that a candidate’s stance on crypto policy could directly impact voters’ investment portfolios.  Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies receive a significant amount of attention from the press compared to other industries, and press is vital for the success of any political candidate. As a result, many politicians are taking strong stances on crypto policy, one way or the other, because it can boost their public profile. Senator JD Vance (R-Ohio), for example, won his first term in 2022, in part, by positioning himself as a pro-Bitcoin candidate. Moreover, in the 2022 New York Governor’s race (the closest one in decades), both Kathy Hochul and Lee Zeldin were asked during their first public debate to share their views on Bitcoin and Bitcoin data centers – a topic never raised in previous election years. It’s clear that, whatever the political viewpoint, Bitcoin is becoming an increasingly important election issue.  The Biden administration has maintained a tough-on-crypto policy posture since taking office in January 2021. Both the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and the Council of Economic Advisers delivered unfavorable reports on Bitcoin.  The OSTP report, for example, railed against the environmental impact of Bitcoin data centers without making apples-to-apples comparisons to other major industries or analyzing the data center market in its entirety. The OSTP report also devoted nearly 20% of its citations – more than any other source by far – to Digiconomist, a highly controversial researcher whose methodology has been largely debunked by various technical analysts. In addition, the President’s budget proposed a specific 30% Digital Asset Mining Energy (DAME) tax on Bitcoin data centers without applying the same standard to any other types of data centers.  Read more: George Kaloudis - Through It All, the Bitcoin Mining Industry Looks Set for Growth  Promoting specific policies that are anti-Bitcoin mining could also negatively affect candidates in the 2024 election. Many Bitcoin data centers are developing businesses in rust belt counties, like those in Pennsylvania and Ohio, which represent key swing votes for a federal election. Bitcoin mining companies are employing thousands of voters, increasing local tax revenue, and revitalizing areas that have been overlooked and underserved for generations.  A Bitcoin mining tax, like the DAME excise tax, would threaten jobs and revitalization in these important electoral communities, and therefore could be met with opposition in key electoral zones. It remains to be seen whether the 2024 Biden campaign will soften its approach toward the industry as it pivots into campaign mode in these areas.  Perhaps the most important political game-changer for the 2024 election may lie within the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency community itself. Bitcoin and crypto enthusiasts can be known for their internal fractiousness. Divisions within divisions among various impassioned ideologies have at times become an almost revolving cycle of mitosis. Yet the political and regulatory crackdown on the industry may serve as a galvanizing force.  Where once protocol wars, Twitter battles, or coin cultures may have trumped all other concerns, there is now a growing unification among many supporters who realize that political cohesion might be necessary for survival in the United States. In a series of investigative pieces in early 2023, investor and analyst Nic Carter laid out in stark detail how the banking sector was potentially being used to extra-judiciously hamstring Bitcoin and crypto businesses. While there were many negative ramifications to such policies for American companies, perhaps the silver lining for the industry is that it served as a wake-up call, demonstrating that internal divisions amount to little when compared with indiscriminate external attack.  In a sense, the anti-Bitcoin and anti-crypto rhetoric espoused by some in Washington DC has unwittingly created an ardent and oppositional voting bloc where one had not previously existed. Like any industry or community, Bitcoin and crypto supporters are diverse and varied in personal experience and political outlook. But anti-innovation policies continue to be viewed with mistrust by a growing pro-crypto cohort of Democrats, independents and Republicans who are willing to be single-issue voters if they feel that their livelihoods, investments, and ideological beliefs are in jeopardy.  This cohort also believes that anti-innovation policies risk irreparable damage to U.S. competitiveness on the global stage. While there are very few, if any, U.S. voters who would support a candidate simply because they are anti-Bitcoin (it doesn’t move the needle for most people one way or the other), there is a large contingent of U.S. citizens who will vote for a candidate simply because they are pro-Bitcoin. These single-issue voters are the reason why many presidential candidates proudly articulate their pro-innovation, pro-Bitcoin, and pro-crypto positions on the campaign trail – realizing that being “anti-Bitcoin” will alienate a rapidly growing cohort of young, diverse, and politically-engaged American voters.

15280536,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=544241,1690291837,Will Bitcoin Rebound? This Metric May Be The One To Watch,"The on-chain analytics firm Santiment suggests that this indicator may be the one to watch to get hints about when Bitcoin might rebound. Large Stablecoin Holders Have Seen Stagnant Supply Recently According to Santiment, the movements of the dolphins and sharks of the top stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) may be relevant for the price of Bitcoin. Generally, investors make use of these fiat-tied tokens whenever they want to escape the volatility associated with other assets in the market, like BTC. Such investors, however, are likely to buy back into the volatile cryptocurrencies, as holders who are truly exiting the space do so through fiat. When these investors feel that the prices are right to jump back into the other coins, they simply exchange their stablecoins for them. Naturally, this shift can act as buying pressure for the market they are moving into, and thus, provide a bullish boost to the asset’s price. To check whether there is any significant conversion of stables happening into Bitcoin and others right now, Santiment has looked at the data for the supply of the relatively large stablecoin investor groups. More specifically, the combined holdings of the dolphins and sharks are of interest here. These holders generally hold between 10,000 and 100,000 BTC on their balances. Now, here is a chart that shows how the supply of these investor cohorts has changed for USDT and USDC over the last few months: Looks like the two metrics haven't shown much movement in recent days | Source: Santiment on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the dolphins and sharks of the two largest stablecoins in the sector have seen their combined supply move mostly sideways during the last few weeks. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sharks Continue Accumulation, But Whales Stagnate This means that these decently-sized investors haven’t been taking part in any sort of net conversions recently, whether it be swapping Bitcoin into stables, or exchanging their stables for other assets. Interestingly, this sideways trend has continued during the last few days, despite the plunge to the low $29,000 levels that the cryptocurrency has observed in this period. “Currently, one of our key considerations revolves around whether this behavioral pattern will continue in the incoming 24 hours, especially in the wake of today’s fallen prices,” explains the analytics firm. “Will these users perceive this change as an opportunity to ‘buy the dip’? Or will they opt to ‘abandon ship’ amidst growing market uncertainty?” Naturally, if the supply of these large stablecoin holders starts to slip down in the near future, it can be a sign that these investors are buying Bitcoin while its price is at a discount. Related Reading: Bitcoin Plunge To $29,200 Sends 5.9% Of Supply Into Loss Though, on the other hand, an increase instead would obviously be a worrying signal, as it may mean that the dolphins and sharks are starting to give up on BTC for now and exiting from it.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Following its decline below $29,000 for the first time in a month on Monday, bitcoin (BTC) was trading at $29,100 early Tuesday. The bearish price action comes ahead of the Federal Reserve’s expected 25 basis point interest rate hike on Wednesday afternoon. With investors fully anticipating the move, Mike Schwitalla, head of trading at Crypto Finance AG, will be looking to see if market participants receive the actual decision as hawkish. Should slight selloffs ensue in risk markets, he’s looking at support zones for bitcoin around $28,000, $26,000, and $25,000.  The U.K.'s data watchdog, the Information Commissions Office (ICO), will examine Worldcoin, the project by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. ""We note the launch of WorldCoin in the U.K. and will be making further enquiries,"" a spokesperson for the Information Commissioner's Office told CoinDesk. “[Organizations] need to have a clear lawful basis to process personal data,” the spokesperson continued. “Where they are relying on consent, this needs to be freely given and capable of being withdrawn without detriment."" Worldcoin, which launched on Monday, describes itself as a digital passport that can help holders prove they are human. The project already had 2 million users from its beta launch.  Crypto investment products suffered $6.5 million of weekly outflows, according to crypto asset manager CoinShares, breaking a four-week string of inflows that totaled $742 million. Bitcoin-related products led the way, with $13 million of outflows as its price buckled below $30,000, with investors instead putting some money into cryptos like ether (ETH) and Ripple’s XRP.BTC investors have seemingly run out of positive news to bid on after the rally that followed global asset management giant BlackRock filing for a long-coveted spot BTC ETF on June 15. The BlackRock news led to a swarm of competitors renewing their applications, and spurred investors to pile money into BTC-focused investment funds over the next month at the fastest pace since October 2021.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows Binance, the world's leading digital assets exchange, now accounts for over 50% of total trading volume versus just 24% three years ago.  According to Kaiko, the trend could continue amid a wider downturn in market activity, which puts pressure on smaller exchanges.  The concentration of activity on the exchange explains why regulatory uncertainty surrounding Binance tends to weigh on crypto prices.

Leveraging the power of blockchain technology, Xandeum's mission is to empower collective self-determination by creating a scalable, blockchain-based storage layer for smart contracts, which adds a new dimension to the decentralized web. Named External Global Grouped Storage (EGGS), this solution pioneers a new era of storage-enabled Web3 apps (sedApps) on Xandeum. In a departure from the traditional model of seeking venture capital, Xandeum prioritizes community control by selling node licenses directly to its users. The grand launch will introduce an incentivized purchase model, creating a buzz for this revolutionary blockchain project. ""Xandeum is all about transforming the world of blockchain,"" said Bernie Blume, founder of Xandeum. ""We're not just creating another blockchain; we're creating a holistic platform that integrates advanced blockchain technology with a revolutionary storage solution, paving the way for fully-fledged, storage-enabled Web3 apps."" The grand launch introduces an attractive purchase model: the first transaction to purchase a node will receive a generous 50% rebate, the second 49%, the third 48%, and so on until the 50th transaction, which will still secure a 1% rebate. This follows Xandeum's track record of success, already having sold over 2,809 nodes for proceeds surpassing $1.9 million under the prior brand name Bitoku. By opening the market to its community, Xandeum aims to foster further expansion and innovation. “Our community just loves to embark on this journey so early, at least 4 to 5 months ahead of the ICO, in order to reap the maximum benefits.” notes Blume. Post-launch, Xandeum will roll out an incentivized Devnet on August 15, followed by a Testnet in the fall, an ICO of the XAND token in November and a beta version of the mainnet scheduled for 2024.

The integration will go live on August 1 with more than 80 Ethereum-based artists including Sotheby’s “Glitch Art” sale artist Patrick Amadon and creator Amber Vittoria.  According to data from analytics platform CryptoSlam!, Ethereum's non-fungible token (NFT) trading volume takes first place at $10.2 million in the past 24 hours, while Solana trails behind in second place with just over $920,000. Larisa Barbu, COO of Exchange.art told CoinDesk that Exchange.art always had the plan to expand beyond Solana, and aims to onboarding new creators and collectors in doing so.  “The vision of Exchange.art is to be a hub for digital art and then slowly, build out solutions for traditional art as well,” said Barbu. “So because that's the vision, and that's where we aim to go…being multichain is just kind of the next step in this direction.”  She also added that many artists struggle to sell their work across different ecosystems and marketplaces, and doing so on Exchange.art helps them leverage the two largest NFT ecosystems in one place.  “[Artists] would very much prefer to actually maintain only one platform and one community, instead of [always] juggling between two or three platforms, two or three communities, always updating information between the three of them, communicating with people on all of those platforms, and so on.” said Barbu. “It was actually a decision that we took because we had demand for it, from an artist perspective – and it will help quite a lot of artists.”  After releasing in 2021, Exchange.art has onboarded 16,000 Solana-based artists, helping them earn a collective $13 million in sales. With a mission to stand by artists in a time of uncertainty around royalty payments, Exchange.art introduced a royalties protection standard to help creators earn a consistent percentage across marketplaces. In March, Exchange.art released Code Canvas, a derivative platform to help Solana-based creators mint generative art NFT collections.  Additionally, Exchange.art isn’t the first Solana-based NFT marketplace to introduce Ethereum.

Tomorrow, on Wednesday, July 26th, at 2 pm EST, the FOMC will announce its interest rate decision. As usual, Federal Reserve (Fed) chair Jerome Powell will face the media at 2:30 pm EST. According to the CME FedWatch tool, the majority of the market is expecting a 25 basis point increase (99.8%). However, the real intrigue lies in what comes after this move and whether it marks the end of the rate hike cycle. After tomorrow’s decision, the market expects the Fed to keep the key interest rate high for a longer period of time. A first rate cut could come in March 2024 at the earliest, if not in May. Tomorrow is #FOMC day, expect volatility. #Bitcoin #Crypto 98.9% probability of a 25 bps hike by the Fed. Market expects the Fed to keep the key interest rate high for a longer period of time. A first rate cut could come in March ’24 at the earliest, if not in May. pic.twitter.com/C8wscv6BMd — Jake Simmons (@realJakeSimmons) July 25, 2023 Implications For Bitcoin And Crypto For the past 16 months, the U.S. Federal Reserve has been grappling with inflation while hiking interest rates to levels not seen in 20 years. But all signs point to a possible end of the tightening cycle. The market is firmly expecting the 0.25 bps hike to a range of 5.25 to 5.5% will be the last. Meanwhile, Bitcoin and crypto have experienced a period of relative immunity to macroeconomic events and rate hike speculations in the first seven months of the year. However, investors must be aware that such conditions might not last indefinitely. Related Reading: Bitcoin Witnesses Historic Whale Exodus: What You Need To Know On Monday, the Bitcoin price retraced to $29,000 support level. Seemingly, market participants have been cautious in the lead-up to the FOMC’s July meeting, aware that the FOMC meeting can have a profound impact. In June, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell hinted at the possibility of further rate hikes this year, with some committee members advocating for two more increases. The market now anxiously awaits the outcome of this meeting to ascertain the central bank’s future policy stance. However, factors such as declining inflation in the United States and a weaker labor market strengthen the market expectations. The previously skyrocketing inflation, which led to the tightening cycle, has shown signs of abating. June’s Consumer Price Index (YoY) data revealed a decline in inflation to 3.0% from 4.0%. The core rate fell from 5.3% in May to 4.8% in June. Both declines were stronger than previously anticipated. Remarkably, the core rate is now trading below the level of the US federal funds rate, which was pretty rare in the last 20 years. Related Reading: Over $41 Million in Bitcoin Long Positions Liquidated as BTC Crashes Toward $29K The prolonged strength of the US labour market has long been the biggest headache for the Federal Reserve because of the imbalance between supply and demand. At the peak of this imbalance, there were two job openings for every available worker, which drove up wages accordingly. As demand and supply approach equilibrium, job creation numbers have declined. Also, there are even early indications of declining consumer spending. So, what does all of this mean for Bitcoin and crypto investors? As always, it’s essential to approach the market with a balanced perspective. While BTC and cryptocurrencies have shown resilience in the face of traditional economic events, they are not entirely insulated from larger macroeconomic trends. Investors should closely monitor the FOMC’s interest rate decision and Jerome Powell’s subsequent statements. Any signals about the future rate hike cycle could have repercussions for both the traditional as well as Bitcoin and crypto markets, triggering a further sell-off. At press time, the market continued to show indecision. BTC was trading at $29,200.

Russia’s CBDC Legislation Finally Signed into Law Russia moves forward with the launch of its central bank digital currency (CBDC), digital ruble, thus taking a step towards crypto regulation in the country. The digital ruble legislation bill was first introduced to the lower chamber of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation, the State Duma, in December 2022. The bill passed its first reading in March 2023 and its third final reading on July 11, 2023. On July 24, Russia’s president Vladimir Putin finally signed the CBDC bill into law which is scheduled to come into force on August 1, 2023. The new law introduces amendments to several articles of the Russian Federation Civil Code. According to the law, the digital ruble will be treated as a means of cashless payment. Russia’s central bank will be the main entity responsible for the digital ruble’s infrastructure and the safety of the stored assets. How the Digital Ruble Is Expected to Work The digital ruble is primarily designed to be a means of payment or a money transfer method and not aimed at investment purposes. Russia’s central bank reported that transfers and payments in digital rubles will be free for regular citizens, although corporate clients will have to pay 0.3% of the payment amount. The authorities have referred to the digital ruble as a “new opportunity for citizens and businesses”. It’s also important to note that the use of the new currency in the country will be completely voluntary. “No one is going to force anyone into the digital ruble. Its use is absolutely voluntary, it is an additional opportunity for people: they can use it if they want to.” – said the governor of Bank of Russia, Elvira Nabiullina. The government authorities previously reported that trials of the CBDC were to be run in collaboration with 13 local banks that have passed the necessary technical stages of preparation. The digital ruble wallet and transfers should be available in any of the Russian banks’ mobile apps, although all the operations will be carried out by the Central Bank itself. The Bank of Russia highlights the reliability, security, and efficiency of the CBDC operations thanks to their centralized regulation.

The mass adoption of the digital ruble in Russia is expected in 2025-2027. The CBDC could be a way to avoid sanctions against Russia imposed by the West when making cross-border payments.

42392962,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgE45h,1690285854,Worldcoin Token Slumps Amid Crypto Community Unease,"The crypto token tied to the Worldcoin identity-verification project surged after Monday's launch only to see the initial gains erased as the crypto community express concerns about the project co-founded by OpenAI's Sam Altman.  The worldcoin (WLD) token climbed as high as $3.58 on crypto exchanges yesterday before slumping to $1.92 overnight before rebounding, CoinMarketCap data show. It was trading recently more than 25% above the low at $2.43.  The slide is a reflection of the crypto community's disquiet about the project, which uses a hardware unit known as an Orb to identify individuals and prove they are human by scanning their irises. Being able to verify a person in that way will be a key part of a new digital economy in an era when artificial intelligence (AI) is integrated into society, according to the company. Users verified by the Orb can claim WLD tokens on the project's app, where regulations allow.  Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin expressed his concerns about possible abuses of the system in a blog post yesterday, including issues around privacy, centralization and security. Worldcoin has also come under fire for heavily promoting itself in the developing world: About 30% of its Orb-verified users are in each of Asia and Africa, raising concerns about exploitation.  ""Most alarming to me is how the WorldCoin team has boasted about how many users they have. When in reality they have been exploiting people in developing countries,"" tweeted pseudonymous crypto influencer ZachXBT. They cited a story published in April 2022 by MIT Technology Review that found the firm deployed ""deceptive marketing practices, collected more personal data than it acknowledged, and failed to obtain meaningful informed consent.""  Today, the U.K. data watchdog said it is making an inquiry into the project, hinting that the collection of personal data was questionable. A spokesperson for the firm said it adheres ""to the strictest privacy guidelines and requirements in the markets where Worldcoin is available.""  Black sheep  Worldcoin's backing by some of crypto's black sheep has not helped, particularly in light of what critics see as questionable tokenomics.  In its Series A round in October 2021, Worldcoin received investment from Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), the founder and CEO of crypto exchange FTX, which has since gone bankrupt with Bankman-Fried facing allegations of fraud.  The co-founder of bankrupt Singapore hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, Kyle Davies, also hinted that his firm had invested in the project.  ""If my thesis holds correct, the 3AC venture portfolio will be the best performer of 2023. Congrats on Worldcoin,"" he tweeted on Monday. Davies did not respond to CoinDesk's request for comment on his involvement with the project.  As for WLD tokenomics, ""Worldcoin taking a page out of SBF Solana eco playbook, launching and pumping a microcap shitcoin with 1% of total supply in circulation,"" tweeted Dylan LeClair, a markets analyst at Bitcoin Magazine.  The firm has increased its token allocation to 25% from a previously stated 20%, CoinDesk reported at the project's launch.  At launch and for 15 years, a total of 10 billion WLD will be supplied. But only 143 million WLD will be circulating at launch, Worldcoin said in its whitepaper. Tokens allotted to investors and the development team are locked for a year.  The low circulating supply is because the project wants to create ""a network of as many human beings as possible – and to achieve this, the majority of the WLD token supply will be given to new and existing users over the years to come,"" it said. Worldcoin expects the token allocation to increase during the first week of operation.  The circulating supply of WLD has increased by about 3% since its introduction, and there are 155,000 wallets on the Optimism network, where Worldcoin has migrated after launch, according to the project's Dune analytics dashboard.  Worldcoin has over 2 million Orb-verified users, according to its website.  Author and investor William Mougayar tweeted that the project shouldn't have launched the token while it has minimal utility, which opens the gate to speculative trading. The lockup period for early investors is too short for the project's ambitions and they could simply sell once they can, he said.

Binance’s Appeal To Dismiss Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) and its former Chief Compliance Officer Samuel Lim have revealed that they will be filing motions with the court seeking permission to dismiss a prior complaint by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). In the July 24 filing to the Illinois District Court, the defendants, which consist of multiple entities from the Binance ecosystem, have claimed that they will be filing two separate motions to counter the CFTC’s complaint and appeal for its dismissal. The CFTC's lawsuit against Binance was filed on March 27, 2023, and the defendants are required to respond latest by July 27, 2023. In its latest filing, the Foreign Binance Entities, which includes CZ, has revealed intentions to file a joint Motion to Dismiss, while Samuel Lim plans to file a separate motion and incorporate parts of the motion filed by the other defendants. Binance Seeks To Exceed Page Limit Rule The defendants are also seeking to exceed the 15-page limit rule on the brief as they claim that they made every effort to adhere to this limit but contend that due to the intricacy of the CFTC's complaint and the multiple arguments they wish to present, their Memoranda of Law is likely to surpass the given page restriction. The filing reads, “Given the complexity of the CFTC’s Complaint and the number of arguments Defendants anticipate making in support of their Motions to Dismiss, Defendants anticipate that their Memoranda of Law in support of the two motions will exceed the fifteen-page limits.” In their motion, the defendants requested the court's permission to collectively use up to 50 pages for both Memoranda of Law. This proposed limit is 25 pages less than what the defendants would be entitled to under Local Rule 7.1 if each of them separately moved to dismiss the CFTC's complaint. CFTC’s Complaint Notably, the CFTC has agreed not to oppose this request, as confirmed by discussions between both parties' counsels. While the court has yet to issue a ruling on their motion, the cooperation from the CFTC's counsel indicates a willingness to accommodate the defendants' request.

Abu Dhabi is considered a crypto hub thanks to its clear regulations. Rain, which is backed by crypto exchange Coinbase, laid off dozens of employees last year due to the crypto winter.  Rain raised $110 million last year in a Series B funding round that valued the firm at $500 million. It is hoping to attract institutional clients and will also be able to open a bank account in the UAE plus enable clients to fund their own accounts, co-founder Yehia Badawy said in an interview with Reuters, which reported the license approval earlier.

15277593,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=544251,1690284893,Cardano TVL – A Crucial Factor For ADA Price Revival?,"Cardano has leaped considerably in the realm of DeFi activities, particularly in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL), despite the somewhat lackluster performance of ADA itself. TVL refers to the total value of assets locked within various decentralized finance protocols and applications on the Cardano blockchain. An increasing TVL can have several positive implications for the Cardano ecosystem. The significance of TVL lies in its reflection of the overall engagement and adoption of DeFi projects built on Cardano. A higher TVL indicates greater trust and confidence in these decentralized financial services. It demonstrates that users are willing to lock their assets within the ecosystem, utilizing various DeFi protocols for lending, borrowing, staking, and other financial activities. Cardano TVL Surges Amid Price Decline ADA has experienced a recent decline in its price, with the latest data from Coingecko showing it currently stands at $0.305. Over the past 24 hours, the price has faced a modest 0.4% decline, and over the last seven days, it has decreased by a mere 0.3%. Despite these losses, there is a notable silver lining in the form of Cardano’s TVL on the network. Source: Coingecko The surge in Cardano’s TVL by 28% in the last three months indicates a growing interest in the DeFi activities offered by the network. It reflects growing confidence among users willing to lock their assets in decentralized applications, such as lending platforms, decentralized exchanges, and liquidity pools.

This increased participation can foster the development of a vibrant and robust DeFi ecosystem on Cardano, offering users a wide range of financial services. Cardano total value locked. Source: DefiLlama Moreover, the year-to-date (YTD) triple growth of Cardano’s TVL raises optimism for the project’s potential recovery and a potential return to its previous all-time high levels achieved in 2022. Related Reading: XDC Continues To Shoot Up With 74% Gain – What’s Powering This Token? As the DeFi ecosystem on Cardano expands, it can attract more developers, projects, and investors, further enhancing the network’s utility and value proposition. Cardano (ADA) market cap currently at $10 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Cardano DeFi Lockup Surpasses Ethereum, But Market Cap Lags Behind Meanwhile, a recent report sheds light on a noteworthy plunge in the total tokens locked within Ethereum, Cardano’s main rival. On the other hand, Cardano has emerged as a strong contender, outperforming Ethereum regarding individual token lockup within its DeFi ecosystem. While Cardano excels in terms of token lockup, it still needs to catch up in other critical areas compared to Ethereum. One of the most significant disparities lies in the market capitalization of the two cryptocurrencies. Ethereum’s market capitalization remains considerably higher than Cardano’s, highlighting Ethereum’s long-standing dominance in the blockchain space.

According to reports by Reuters, Rain, a Middle Eastern crypto exchange based in Bahrain, and backed by Coinbase, announced today its Abu Dhabi unit secured a “license to operate a virtual assets brokerage and custody service for clients in the United Arab Emirates.” Rain Expands Offerings into UAE Obtaining the license means that Rain’s unit based in the Abu Dhabi Global Market financial free zone may now offer institutional and a limited number of retail clients in the UAE services to buy, sell, and store their virtual assets. Yehia Badawy, Rain’s co-founder, said in an interview with Reuters that the license further allows the exchange to open a bank account in the UAE and permits its clients in the region to fund their own accounts provided they use a local payment network. Badawy noted that local asset managers have been reluctant to work with crypto firms who do not have domestic operating licenses but said they would now confidently deal with such firms. He further stated: “We can capture more demand from institutional investors using this licence.” Badawy founded Rain with three partners in 2017 with the backing and support of venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins and Coinbase Ventures. Rain has seen significant growth after it raised $110 million in a Series B funding round in 2022, placing the firm’s value at $500 million.

Once, the crypto market held a significant lead over traditional stocks, according to Bloomberg. However, this advantage seems to be dwindling as Bitcoin – a leading market indicator – exhibits signs of struggle. The year-to-date rise of the top 100 digital tokens now stands at 46%, narrowing the gap with the 41% increase of the tech-driven Nasdaq 100 Index. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Realized Cap Nears $400 Billion Despite Price Struggle At $30,000 Technology stocks, particularly those influenced by artificial intelligence hype, have been rapidly gaining ground. This surge resulted in the Nasdaq 100 Index briefly surpassing the MVIS CryptoCompare Digital Assets 100 Index in June. Impact of Regulatory Changes And Fed Decisions Previously, the crypto market received a positive push from both regulatory efforts on digital assets that face a stumbling block in US court on digital assets and the hope that spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) would be authorized in the US. However, these boosting factors have waned. Investors are now cautiously considering how the anticipated interest-rate hike by the Federal Reserve could impact both traditional and digital markets. According to Caroline Mauron, co-founder of digital-asset derivatives liquidity provider OrBit Markets, the rally has lost momentum since the initial excitement sparked by the ETF news. “There are no other visible catalysts on the horizon,” she noted. She also hinted at a potential silver lining, pointing out that the “downside risk should be limited as the Fed is near the end of the current rate hiking cycle, which should support risk assets including crypto.” Bitcoin Chart Patterns Signal Warning Signs Further cause for concern is seen in the various chart patterns that track Bitcoin’s performance. A key indicator, Bitcoin’s 20-week Bollinger bandwidth, has contracted to its narrowest in seven years. This tightening suggests that moves in the value of Bitcoin could intensify, according to Bloomberg. If crucial thresholds aren’t maintained, it’s likely we could see a downward trend. The Bollinger study also provides an invaluable method for analyzing the volatility of this digital asset. Market analyst at IG Australia Pty, Tony Sycamore, noted the potential for Bitcoin’s drop to continue, “Bitcoin should extend toward $26,000/$25,000 before finding support,” he predicted.

Particularly, in the past 24 hours, the asset has traded slightly above $29,000 down by 1.3%. This price action has resulted in more than 45,000 traders caught in the crypto market total liquidation of over $130 million in the past day. Furthermore, Bitcoin currently has a 24-hour high of $29,762 and a 24-hour low of $29,983, at the time of writing. The asset’s market cap has plunged from a high of $583 billion seen last Tuesday to $567 billion, as of today. Additionally, BTC trading volume has also declined in the past week indicating less trading activity.

With Do Kwon currently languishing in a Montenegrin jail, crypto users have long been trying to seek out any information regarding his crypto wallets. “Deanonymizing The Blockchain” The Arkham Intel Exchange is a highly controversial platform, acting as a marketplace that facilitates the trading of on-chain data. The platform recently approved its first-ever bounty submission after two crypto sleuths found evidence of crypto wallets belonging to Do Kwon. An anonymous user, along with a pseudo-anonymous Twitter user going by the name of @ErgoBTC, were paid around 9500 ARKM tokens, worth around $5000 for their submission. “The Arkham Intel Exchange now has its first approved submission: new evidence of wallets owned by Do Kwon / Terraform Labs. An anonymous on-chain sleuth and @ErgoBTC were the successful bounty hunters.” It further added, “Expanded labels for the LFG BTC address activity after running off with funds intended for the defense of the UST depeg have been added to Arkham as a part of their bounty program.” According to Arkham Intel, the anonymous user and Ergo sent the platform considerable evidence they had found wallets owned by Do Kwon and Terra. Ergo stated this evidence contradicts public statements made by Terra that it holds only one Luna Foundation Guard wallet. Luna Foundation Guard stated that 80,081 BTC, which comprised over 99% of its reserves, had exited the fund. LFG had claimed that the reason behind the sale of the crypto asset was to shore up and support the overall health of the Terra ecosystem.

Ergo had written at the time, “While it may be true that this is the only formally ‘declared’ wallet controlled by the LFG, they seem to have failed to account for the trail of bread crumbs left by the change outputs used to fund their new declared wallet.” The crypto sleuth continued to track the funds over the next few months and noted that they were moving even after Do Kwon’s arrest in March. “Kwon may have been rolled up for faking a passport. But LFG and the BTC are still moving.” The wallet being tracked has been officially christened “Terraform Labs” on the Arkham Intel Exchange and currently holds around $160 million worth of crypto, out of which around $153 million is in Bitcoin. The Arkham Intel Exchange The Arkham Intel Exchange was launched on the 10th of July to generally negative reactions by members of the crypto space, with most describing it as a glorified snitching service. Many in the crypto space have also stated that the platform could be used to dox innocent individuals. Users on the platform can place bounties for information related to blockchain transactions, which would then be released to the public within 90 days following approval from the platform.

42392953,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgE3Qf,1690277266,Fed Preview: Crypto Observers See Powell Keeping Door Open for Rate Hikes Beyond July,"The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) is set to announce its interest rate decision on Wednesday and the question is not whether it will hike the benchmark borrowing cost by 25 basis points (bps), but whether the increase will mark the end of a tightening cycle that began 16 months ago and was partly responsible for last year's crypto market crash.  The Fed is expected to raise the rate to a 22-year high of 5.25%-5.5%, with Chairman Jerome Powell holding a press conference half an hour after the 18:00 UTC (14:00 ET) announcement.  A recent Reuters survey of 106 economists showed most expect the hike to be the last one for a while. Fed funds futures show traders also expect the Fed to subsequently hold rates steady until early next year. Some crypto observers, however, suggest otherwise.  ""Looking at the Fed’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) from June, the median forecast among Fed officials indicated two more 25 bp hikes would occur by year-end, but markets haven’t fully bought into this view and continue to imply that one hike (~65%) is more likely than two (~27%),"" Matt Kunke, a research analyst at crypto trading firm and liquidity provider GSR told CoinDesk.  ""Our year-end base case remains aligned with the SEP forecasts and anticipates another hike will follow this year due to the sustained persistence of inflation as measured by Core PCE, which is the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge,"" Kunke said.  It's not just crypto. Bank of America expects the Fed to raise rates in September.  ""We continue to expect a second 25bp hike in Sept, but action beyond July remains highly data dependent, both in terms of the timing of hikes and whether they happen,"" Bank of America's FX global research team said in a note to clients on Friday.  Since the June's Fed meeting stocks have surged and investors have trimmed expectations of more tightening, taking note of continued labor market resilience and dwindling inflation and have grown more confident of a soft landing for the economy. Bitcoin has rallied 16%, largely on the back of spot-ETF optimism and partly aided by the 'goldilocks' economic scenario.  That means suggestions of more rate hikes beyond July may see investors take some risk off the table, putting downward pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.  ""A 25 bps interest rate hike is fully expected by the market, but we will be watching the language in the FOMC statement and the subsequent Powell press conference, where a hawkish tone leaving the doors open to a further rate hike this year may put further downward pressure on markets,"" Dick Lo, the founder and CEO of quant-driven crypto trading firm TDX Strategies, said.  Correlations change fast  It's possible that the Fed's communique and Wall Street sentiment do not matter as much to bitcoin: The cryptocurrency's correlation to stocks has weakened in the past 90 days.  However, correlations are backward-looking indicators and can change fast. Besides, bitcoin's bullish momentum, strengthened by BlackRock's ETF filing on June 15, has weakened of late, with the likes of JPMorgan saying any approval is unlikely to be a game changer for the crypto market. On Monday, the cryptocurrency fell over 3%, diving out of its Bollinger bands to signal a potential volatility explosion to the downside.  That means, crypto traders may be better off paying attention to what the Fed says and how traditional markets react.  ""I'm looking into what tone the Fed will set for the next meetings in September and beyond. We are at an intriguing juncture, as inflation has been receding, but the favorable base effects will be less pronounced from here on. Additionally, the oil price bounced back about 10% over the past few weeks,"" David Lawant, head of research at institutional crypto derivatives platform FalconX, said in an email, hinting at the scope for a hawkish Fed talk.  Lawant said the current crypto market action is reminiscent of 2019, marked by excitement within the crypto industry and some apathy from the broader market.  ""I'm expecting the [crypto] market to move along with risk assets more broadly,"" Lawant said.  Tim Frost, CEO of digital wealth platform Yield App warned it may be too early to celebrate the crypto bull market.  ""If Powell’s speech is particularly hawkish, or later minutes reveal sustained or increased hawkish sentiment, this will likely kneecap the crypto rally we saw last week,"" Frost said. ""With recent rulings from the SEC regarding Binance, Coinbase, and then Ripple’s partial victory over the regulator providing some certainty, many have already begun celebrating the beginning of a bull market. It is, though, too early to pop the champagne.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/25/fed-preview-crypto-observers-expect-powell-to-keep-doors-open-for-rate-hikes-beyond-july,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5e140eba85e1266a050930a7ef5582d2306bc854-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bankman-Fried had come under fire for conducting an interview with the New York Times, which prosecutors have claimed amounts to witness tampering. Bail Status In Jeopardy The gag order prevents the FTX founder from making any public statements related to the lawsuit, FTX, and the people involved with the lawsuit. Judge Lewis Kaplan, who is presiding over the case, will make a ruling on whether the gag order is required at the upcoming hearing for the lawsuit, scheduled on the 26th of July. The judge will also look at the “adequacy and continuation” of Bankman-Fried’s bail, suggesting that his current bail status could be in jeopardy. The proposed order bans Bankman-Fried and others associated with the lawsuit from discussing anything with the press that could interfere with a fair trial. This includes statements regarding the credibility of witnesses, information that is not admissible during the trial, and any statement or opinion about the case that could influence the public. The order also extends to attorneys. However, it does not prevent Bankman-Fried from asserting his innocence. The New York Times Story Bankman-Fried came under criticism following a story published in the New York Times. The story’s focus was Caroline Ellison, the CEO of Alameda Research, and talked about writings found in her personal journals and Google Docs, appearing to show her ambivalence about her relationship with SBF and role at FTX. These were written by Ellison when she was the head of Alameda Research and before the collapse of FTX. She also talked about her struggles when it came to leading Alameda, which she described as “overwhelming.” Following the story, federal prosecutors launched a scathing attack on SBF, accusing him of leaking stories to newspapers and showing their witness in poor light. They also described it as a malicious effort to influence the jury pool toward the witness. “In addition to tainting the jury pool, the effect, if not the intent, of the defendant’s conduct is not only to harass Ellison but also to deter other potential trial witnesses from testifying.” Nothing Malicious Bankman-Fried’s lawyers confirmed in a letter sent to Judge Kaplan that the former FTX CEO had met with reporters, adding that he gave them Ellison’s documents. However, they denied all allegations of witness tampering as alleged by the prosecution. Bankman-Fried’s lawyers argued that the prosecution’s allegations were unfounded and that he had no malicious intention when he shared the documents with reporters. “[SBF] did not violate the protective order in this case, nor did he violate his bail conditions, nor did he violate any law or rule.” Additionally, the defense stated that Bankman-Fried would agree to the gag order and refrain from discussing or making public statements regarding the case. However, they argued that the gag order should also apply to the prosecution, along with all witnesses, including current FTX CEO John Ray. Bankman-Fried’s lawyers argued that Ray had publicly vilified and attacked their client and continues to portray him as a villain, despite the case’s ongoing status. Bankman-Fried’s House Arrest Bankman-Fried has already been summoned by Judge Kaplan following the accusations, with the judge skeptical regarding his bail conditions. He has already warned Kaplan has already warned SBF that he could end up going back to jail if he did not curtail his use of VPN programs and encrypted messaging apps. The former CEO is under house arrest at his parent’s home in California as part of a $250 million bail package. However, the bail conditions have already been tightened twice. Visitors are now required to hand over their devices to a guard at the front door.

15272365,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=544227,1690272338,Bitcoin Witnesses Historic Whale Exodus: What You Need To Know,"Bitcoin whales are witnessing a historic exodus. @CryptoVizArt, a senior researcher at Glassnode has shed light on the significant shifts within the whale cohort in a new analysis. Bitcoin Whales’ Impact: Unveiling The Numbers In a remarkable revelation, the research highlights the substantial impact of whales on recent market activity. According to the data, “34% of sell pressure in the last 30 day was from Binance whales.” These influential entities have been instrumental in shaping the recent market dynamics. Moreover, the research also highlights a trend in whale behavior: a noteworthy decline in the total balance of whale entities on exchanges. In the last 30 days, the report states, “Whale Flow to Exchanges witnessed the largest monthly balance decline in history, hitting -148,000 BTC/month.” This dramatic decline marks a significant shift within the whale cohort, raising intriguing questions about their motives and strategies. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Hits Next Bearish Target But Bears Are Not Done Yet As the market witnessed the rally above $31,000, the influx of whale funds to exchanges surged remarkably. Glassnode’s data reveals that whale inflow volumes reached an impressive +16,300 BTC/day, signifying their active involvement in recent market movements. Notably, this whale dominance accounted for 41% of all exchange inflows, which is comparable to both the LUNA crash (39%) and the failure of FTX (33%). Throughout June and July, whale inflows have sustained an elevated inflow bias of between 4,000 to 6,500 BTC/day. Among all exchanges, Binance emerged as the primary destination for whale inflows. The report discloses that around 82% of whale-to-exchange flows were heading into Binance. In contrast, Coinbase accounted for 6.8%, and all other exchanges account for 11.2%. While the overall balance of whales may have declined, @CryptoVizArt’s analysis points to intriguing internal dynamics within the whale cohort. As some whales increased their balances, others experienced declines. This phenomenon led the researcher to introduce the concept of ‘Whale Reshuffling,’ suggesting that not all whales follow the same strategy. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exodus: Exchange Balances Plummet To Lowest Levels Since 2018 The examination of the whale cohort over the last 30 days shows that whales with more than 100,000 BTC have recorded an increase of +6,000 BTC, whales with 10k-100k BTC have decreased their account balance by -49.0k BTC and whales with 1k-10k BTC have increased their account balance by +33.8k BTC. However, in aggregate, the whale group has seen just -8.7k BTC in net outflows. Remarkably, whale entities now account for only 46% of the total supply, down from 63% at the beginning of 2021. Since the early days of Bitcoin, a steady downward trend can be observed. Short-Term Holders: The Driving Force The research also sheds light on the dominance of short-term holders (STHs) among the whale entities. The data indicates that STHs represent a significant portion of recent trading activity, actively trading the market. This behavior is evident as market rallies and corrections lead to notable upticks in profit or loss among this group. Short-Term Holder (STH) Dominance across Exchange Inflows has exploded to 82%. This is drastically above the long-term range over the last five years (typically 55% to 65%). “From this, we can establish a case that much of the recent trading activity is driven by Whales active within the 2023 market and thus classified as STHs”, states the analyst, adding, “each rally and correction since the FTX fallout has seen a 10k+ BTC uptick in STH profit or loss, respectively.” BTC whale transactions can therefore currently be a good indicator. However, special attention also needs to be paid to the STHs, which will eventually run out of bullets at some point. At press time, the BTC price stood at $29,203.

CoinGecko data shows DOGE surged as much as 10% to over 7.7 cents in the past 24 hours, with trading volumes at $2.3 billion. Most of these volumes came from the South Korean exchange UpBit – known for attracting speculative plays – against the Korean won trading pair.  Read more: Elon Musk’s Twitter Overhaul Could Be Huge for DOGE and Crypto Generally  Futures traders lost nearly $10 million betting on and against dogecoin’s price movements, Coinglass data shows.  Analysts say Twitter, which rebranded to the everything app X on Monday, could soon accept DOGE tokens in the coming months, given owner Elon Musk’s seeming infatuation with the meme coin.  “The speculation is that advertisers could be able to pay DOGE for ads and for other uses on Twitter,” Simon Schaber, CBDO of Spool DAO, explained to CoinDesk in a Telegram message.  “We have seen the same happening when Tesla revealed the ability to pay for its goods with DOGE. So the speculation could be around Musk’s businesses and stakeholdings starting to accept crypto, as Tesla does,” Schaber added.  Such speculations aren’t entirely unfounded.

Binance has become the subject of the US’s efforts to eliminate crypto exchanges it deems to have acted improperly. SEC: Binance.US Engaged in “Wash Trading” US regulatory action this time comes as the SEC accused Binance’s US arm, Binance.US, of inflating its trading volumes – a practice known as “wash trading.” The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) first reported the news and said some of the exchange’s crypto trading was a “mirage”, according to SEC. Most accusations levelled against the exchange and its CEO, Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao, came after the SEC sued Binance, Binance.US, and CZ. In its claims against the exchange, the SEC alleged that trading volumes on Binance.US were inflated by a firm owned by Zhao. The WSJ report says the securities agency alleges that Binance.US inflated trading volumes “by using dozens of user accounts held by Sigma Chain, a Swiss trading company controlled by Zhao.” The WSJ also cites an academic report and boldly claims that over 70% of trading volume on crypto exchanges is derived from wash trading. Binance.US filed a lawsuit against the SEC for its claims of improper handling of customer funds and said the SEC were “misleading: the public in its ongoing cases. The SEC accused Binance and CZ of commingling customer assets in a press release. “Given that Changpeng Zhao and Binance have control of the platforms’ customers’ assets and have been able to commingle customer assets or divert customer assets as they please, as we have alleged, these prohibitions are essential to protecting investor assets.” A spokesperson addressed the SEC’s allegations of wash trading, saying they are “entirely unfounded.” The WSJ further reports the spokesperson said the claims are “based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the facts and a misapplication of the relevant law.” Binance.US Feels the Pressure The exchange naturally has felt the effects of the SEC’s endless lawsuits and allegations. Recent reports indicated Binance’s US affiliate laid off some of its staff following the agency’s actions. Binance Seeks Dismissal of CFTC Complaint In a July 24 report, news agency Reuters said that Binance and its CEO are “planning to seek dismissal of a Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) complaint accusing the crypto exchange of violating the Commodity Exchange Act and certain related federal regulations.” Binance has until July 27 to submit its response to the CFTC’s complaint and will reportedly seek a dismissal.

""A formal coordination mechanism for addressing blockchain-related risks, which could establish processes or time frames for responding to risks, could help federal financial regulators collectively identify risks and develop timely and appropriate responses.""  The Treasury’s Financial Stability Oversight Council has been tasked to lead the development of a unified approach to crypto asset oversight, as per a March 2022 Executive Order.  Of particular concern to the GAO is that there’s a major gap in regulatory authority over stablecoins, calling the U.S. financial regulatory structure fragmented, particularly with regard to standards surrounding reserve levels and public disclosure of reserves.  The report argues that there’s a need for regular audits of and public disclosures of reserve assets and audit results and for establishing a legal framework regarding redemption rights.  DeFi's Contagion Potential  As decentralized finance (DeFi) has grown in market size, so too has its risk to the crypto economy and broader macro market, the report says.  An absence of intermediaries in DeFi raises regulatory concerns about compliance and consumer protection, the report argues, and as these services become more interconnected and decentralized, the risks, including financial shocks and illicit finance, escalate.  The report says that regulatory bodies like the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to evaluate how existing regulations might apply to these platforms.  Seven Recommendations  Major U.S. financial regulators - the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Federal Reserve System, the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) - should jointly establish or adapt an existing formal coordination mechanism, the report says.  This collaborative mechanism would be used to collectively identify and respond in a timely manner to the risks posed by blockchain-related products and services, the report argues.  Only the NCUA agreed with the recommendations made to them.  Others regulators neither agreed nor disagreed with the recommendations, but noted existing coordination efforts through various forums, such as the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), the President’s Working Group, and some international groups.",NEUTRAL,없음,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/07/25/federal-regulators-are-needed-for-crypto-oversight-us-accountability-office,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/486bf58b857e6a81d8416419b3c542ed919ddee3-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The launch comes as the Federal Reserve looks to modernize and streamline the United States’ payment system. Research on financial systems has been ongoing since 2021 FedNow enables instant payment between users and banks and boasts of its 24/7/365 operations. Users will have full access to their funds and also do not have to pay anything to join the service. The Federal Reserve expects the service to speed up the flow of money throughout the country. According to the FedNow’s own website, the initial launch will simply focus on “core clearing and settlement capabilities” and additional features will be launched in phases, depending on industry demands and changes in technology. As more banks and credit unions adopt the service, users and businesses can expect more benefits. As of writing, early adopters of the service include big banks like JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and BNY Mellon. While this development is of course a net positive for everyday users, the launch of FedNow raises a glaring question, especially regarding the United States’ own financial system. There are already existing systems like Venmo, Paypal or even The Clearing House’s Real-Time Payments (RTP) Network that enable instant payments. So the question becomes what is FedNow really for?

Although the Federal Reserve has said that FedNow will not be used as a springboard to the launch of the United States’ own central bank digital currency (CBDC), this has not stopped the cryptocurrency community from speculating and worrying.

Kishida made these remarks in a recorded video broadcast at the WebX conference in Tokyo which opened Tuesday, continuing the Liberal Democratic Party's embrace of Web3.  The country's leader reiterated that “Web3 is part of the new form of capitalism,” referring to his flagship economic policy intended to drive growth and wealth distribution by focusing on innovation, startups and digital transformation.  “A major Japanese company will announce an ambitious large-scale project that will create a valuable economic zone in the metaverse,” Kishida said.  The ruling Liberal Democratic Party's policy research council chairman Koichi Hagiuda took to the stage just before Kishida's speech to lay out the party's stance towards Web3, saying that even those unfamiliar with the industry should take an “inclusive stance.”  Since last year, a handful of politicians in Japan have been working on policy and guidelines for NFTs, stablecoins and DAOs, and done away with an onerous tax requirement which drove project founders away from the country.

There has been some intertwining contexts with latest legal fracas with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which involves Terraform Labs and its co-founder, Do Kwon. Notably, the SEC's recent motion against Terraform Labs has revived discussions around the landmark Ripple Labs case, signaling a possible appeal on the horizon. Institutional vs. Retail: Divergent Perspectives In the Ripple Labs case, the court determined that Ripple's XRP token sales to institutional investors breached SEC rules. However, the judge ruled that Ripple's offerings to retail investors on exchanges didn't infringe on these same regulations. This bifurcation of institutional and retail sales was broadly seen as a victory for the crypto industry. In a stark departure from this view, the SEC, in its most recent filing against Terraform Labs and Kwon, voiced its disapproval. The agency stated: ""The decision creates an artificial distinction between the expectations of sophisticated institutional and retail investors."" In the SEC's view, the ruling reformulates the decades-old Howey Test, a metric used to identify when assets are securities, transforming it into a more subjective standard. Accordingly, the SEC requested that the court reject this part of the Ripple decision and hinted at a possible appeal in the Ripple case. The Ripple Ruling's Impact on Terraform Labs Lawsuit The Ripple ruling has become a crucial reference in the ongoing lawsuit against Terraform Labs and Kwon. Their legal representatives cited the Ripple decision in their dismissal motion, arguing that it ""confirms the legal insufficiency of the SEC’s argument."" They were referring to the SEC's assertion that certain tokens, including the ill-fated TerraUSD stablecoin, were securities due to their method of sale. However, the SEC has doubled down on its accusations that Terraform Labs and Kwon offered and sold unregistered securities as part of a fraudulent scheme, causing a loss of at least $40 billion in market value. The SEC also underscored that the institutional investor aspect of the Ripple ruling supports its case against Terraform Labs. The SEC notes that institutional buyers in such a case (such as trading firms that purchased crypto assets from Terraform Labs with no restrictions on resale) purchased ostensibly on the reason that the assets were an investment on top of Terraform Lab's initiatives. The legal entanglements involving the SEC, Ripple Labs, and now Terraform Labs, highlightts the evolving dynamics between the emerging crypto industry and established securities regulations. The nuanced interpretation of these regulations in relation to cryptocurrencies like XRP and TerraUSD has far-reaching implications for the industry. How these cases play out in the courts will set precedents that could shape the crypto landscape for years to come. SEC's Prospective Appeal The SEC's recent motion reveals its plan to challenge the federal court ruling in favor of Ripple Labs. U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres upheld that nearly half of Ripple's XRP sales did not contravene investor-protection laws. This verdict sparked hope among other defendants embroiled in disputes with the SEC regarding their cryptocurrency sales, which, according to the SEC, often constitute illegally sold securities. This court ruling has become a beacon of hope for defendants like Do Kwon, co-founder of Terraform Labs. Kwon, currently serving time in prison, faces an SEC lawsuit alleging fraudulent activities and various legal infringements. The lawsuit was filed in February in Manhattan federal court. In light of the recent Ripple Labs ruling, Kwon's defense is employing it as a basis to refute the SEC's accusations.

15264529,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=544181,1690254023,Bitcoin Exodus: Exchange Balances Plummet To Lowest Levels Since 2018,"Bitcoin (BTC) continues to dominate the cryptocurrency market, as exchange balances have dropped to levels last seen in early 2018. This signals a growing trend of investors moving their Bitcoin holdings to cold storage, which is considered to be more secure. According to a recent report by Bitfinex, while some of this decline in exchange balances may be attributed to the usage of decentralized exchanges and funds not covered in the data, the overarching trend appears to be a widespread movement of people withdrawing their Bitcoin from exchanges. Bitcoin-Backed Funds Lead Crypto Investment Surge This trend is also reflected in the recent data from CoinShares, which shows that traditional fund investors are demonstrating a renewed interest in Bitcoin. Crypto-backed investment funds saw a net inflow of $137 million last week, with a staggering 99 percent of this sum directed toward Bitcoin-backed funds. Related Reading: Elon Musk Incorporates Dogecoin Symbol In Twitter Bio, Triggering 5% Increase In Price According to Bitfinex, this marks the fourth consecutive week of gross inflows into crypto funds, amassing a total of $742 million over the period, representing the largest run of inflows since the final quarter of 2021. The sustained inflows into Bitcoin-backed funds indicate strong investor confidence in the asset, despite the volatility inherent in the crypto market. Additionally, the outflows from short-Bitcoin funds reinforce the bullish sentiment for the BTC price among investors, which has now been in a tight range for months. This data can thus be used as a proxy for institutional investor bias that the price will break out of this range toward the upside. Meanwhile, Ethereum funds were the only other category to see outflows last week, losing $1.6 million on a net basis. Altcoin funds, on the other hand, recorded slight inflows, with the largest going to multi-asset funds, followed by funds backed by Solana’s SOL token and Polygon’s MATIC. Overall, this data paints a clear picture of Bitcoin’s continued dominance in the crypto market. While altcoins are making their presence felt, Bitcoin remains the preferred asset for traditional fund investors. The sustained inflows into Bitcoin-backed funds suggest that investors have confidence in the asset’s long-term growth potential, despite the short-term volatility in the crypto market. BTC Whales Increased Activity Indicates Bullish Market Sentiment According to a report by Glassnode, whales, or entities holding 1,000 or more BTC, have been making significant moves in the cryptocurrency market, with whale inflows to exchanges being historically large and accounting for 41% of the total. The dominance of whale inflow volumes to exchanges is significant, with over 82% of whale inflows destined for Binance, the largest exchange in the industry. This trend highlights the importance of the role played by whales in the cryptocurrency market, as their activity can have a significant impact on the price and overall sentiment of Bitcoin. While the report notes that many of these active whale entities are classified as short-term holders, with notable activity around local market peaks and troughs, it also highlights the long-term behavior of whales.

On the other hand, the whale subdivisions with more than 1,000 BTC demonstrated divergent behavior, with those holding more than 10,000 BTC distributing and those holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC accumulating at a significantly higher rate. This behavior suggests that whales are actively reshuffling their holdings, moving funds internally between entities. While this can have short-term implications for the market, it also highlights the long-term potential for Bitcoin to remain a valuable asset for investors.

15262936,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=544185,1690250420,Fidelity Backs Ethereum: Wall Street’s Biggest Players Bet On Crypto’s Number 2,"Fidelity, a leading financial services provider, has recently released a report on Ethereum (ETH) that sheds light on some key metrics to watch for the cryptocurrency in the coming months. The report highlights several important indicators, including the 50-day and 200-day moving averages (MA), the realized price, the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) ratio, Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Z-Score, percent in profit, and the Pi Cycle indicators, all of which can provide valuable insights into market sentiment and potential price movements. Ethereum Holds Strong Above Key Support Levels Per the report, Ethereum has remained above key support levels, with the realized price serving as a strong support level since January 10th. Additionally, the NUPL ratio suggests that Ethereum is currently in a neutral zone, while the MVRV Z-Score indicates that the cryptocurrency’s market value is estimated to be just over the “fair” zone, potentially setting the stage for a bull run or at least sideways price action, according to Fidelity. Another interesting metric highlighted in the report is the percent of unique addresses in profit, which currently sits at nearly 66%. While this metric has not touched the green zone since January 2020, it suggests that Ethereum owners may be using the cryptocurrency for trading, DeFi, staking, or buying other digital assets. Related Reading: Bittrex To US Users: Withdraw Your Crypto Or Risk Running Into Issues Furthermore, the Pi Cycle indicators, which have historically been a good cycle top indicator, are showing that Ethereum is currently in a neutral zone. As the long-term moving average continues to follow the sunken price downward, it may be setting the stage for more volatility shortly. However, whether this volatility will be to the upside or downside remains to be seen and could depend on a variety of macro factors. ETH Adoption On The Rise On the other hand, Fidelity’s report highlights that while monthly active addresses and the monthly transaction count have fallen by 1%, the number of monthly new Ethereum addresses has slowly increased by 9% in Q2 2023. New addresses are defined as unique addresses that appeared for the first time in a transaction. This metric for momentum may not show direct network usage, but it does indicate a clearer picture of Ethereum adoption. The short-term moving average of new addresses is shown to be rising back above that of the longer-term moving average, indicating that the rate of new users joining the network is increasing. New and existing projects are likely incentivizing new users and helping to drive this increase. Another significant metric highlighted in the report is the net issuance of new supply issued by the network minus burned supply from transactions since The Merge. Related Reading: Bitcoin Plunge To $29,200 Sends 5.9% Of Supply Into Loss This has driven a supply decrease for over five months now, with net issuance surpassing -700,000 Ether. The report notes that this is important because, in theory, as Ethereum’s supply is destroyed, it raises the relative ownership level of all remaining token holders. As of writing, ETH’s price is at $1,849, which has decreased by 2% within the last 24 hours. Similar to Bitcoin’s situation, Ethereum has also lost its 50-day MA, which is currently positioned at $1,869. If the market continues to decline, ETH can anticipate several key support levels that may help prevent a further bearish trend. The closest support level is situated at $1,840, followed by another support level of $1,792. However, the most crucial support floor is the 200-day MA, which is located at $1,780. This will be a significant factor in determining who will dominate in the upcoming months.

The CFTC sued Binance, its founder Changpeng Zhao and compliance officer Samuel Lim in a U.S. court in Illinois in March, alleging that the exchange operated a derivatives trading operation in the U.S. and directed its American employees to obscure their locations to evade restrictions.  Binance was also sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which asked for a temporary restraining order to be placed on all funds deposited at Binance.US — the American arm of the company. The restraining order, called a ""death penalty"" by a lawyer for Binance.US, was never put in place as Binance.US and the SEC agreed to a deal that would see the branch's assets and servers be put under the control of only its U.S.-based staff.  Since then, attitudes toward the U.S. regulatory environment have shifted, with Ripple scoring a partial win against the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier in July.  Binance’s response to the CFTC’s complaint is due later this week, on July 27. The filing did not specify Binance’s argument, only that it is requesting to exceed the standard 15-page limit due to the complexity of the case.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: As Altcoin dominance reaches a multi-month high, Worldcoin's WLD token is up 30% on-launch. But the project comes with real world centralization and privacy concerns.

The CoinDesk Market Index is down 2.6% to 1,227.  All the market wants to trade is Worldcoin (WLD).  The freshly launched token from the Sam Altman-affiliated project is up 30% in the last 24 hours as the market looks into the orb.  While the Worldcoin-Altman brands are no doubt strong enough for a well-received launch, the market may be reacting as it is because of altcoin dominance.  According to a new report by Kaiko, bitcoin's volume dominance has declined to its lowest level since April, at 27%, driven by a surge in altcoin trading following the Ripple ruling and regulatory changes, with the largest declines seen on offshore exchanges and a notable rise in altcoin activity on U.S. exchanges (WLD is banned for now in the U.S).  The question is, how long will this run last for? Crypto always loves a new shiny thing, but WLD has real-world privacy and centralization implications.  Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is already raising concerns about the project, which makes many wonder if it has long-term viability outside the initial market pump.

At least one of them has disappeared. According to a CoinShares report Monday,Bitcoin (BTC) investment products suffered a $13 million outflow last week, reversing the trend of consecutive weeks of massive inflows as investors instead favored funds focusing on smaller cryptocurrencies such as ether (ETH) and Ripple’s XRP, crypto asset manager. Digital asset funds overall witnessed weekly outflows of $6.5 million after gaining $742 million of inflows through the previous four weeks. The trend turnabout came as BTC investors have seemingly run out of positive news to bid on after some major catalysts in recent weeks. Spot bitcoin ETF applications by BlackRock and other financial service giants are now June ghosts with a Securities and Exchange Commission approval unlikely any time soon and BTC's price languishing.  Mining Swinging Upward  After a rough 2022, bitcoin mining is swinging upward, as CoinDesk analyst George Kaloudis writes. The bear market that sapped prices and publicly traded miners' stocks tumbling has lessened this year. Crypto mining is now mostly healthy. Bitcoin network’s hashrate, a measure of the amount of computing power committed to running the network, shows a bountiful capacity with which to run crypto’s premier network. As of July 21, Bitcoin’s hashrate was 400 exahash per second, up five-fold from June 2021. And a number of miners have returned to report healthy margins, especially those that have access to cheap energy like TeraWulf (WULF) and CipherMining (CIPHER), whose gross margins in Q1 2023 exceeded 60% (see below).

The drop below the primary support is heaping pressure on the coin. It may draw more selling pressure in upcoming sessions, pushing prices toward immediate reaction lines, the next being at about $28,300. Bitcoin Drops, Over $41 Million Of Longs Liquidated In crypto trading, liquidation happens the facilitating exchange, for example, OKX or Binance, forcibly takes over the collateral securing the leverage position whenever prices move against the trader’s prognosis. In this case, the recent liquidation was triggered by the rapid sell-off in Bitcoin, leading to a more than 4% price decline within a few hours during the New York Session on July 24. Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange and a platform facilitating trading crypto derivatives, liquidated most levered positions. Significant liquidation amounts were also observed in ByBit and OKX. Related Reading: Binance Announces Listing Of Sam Altman’s Worldcoin, Opens Deposits A big chunk of liquidated positions were “longs,” meaning traders expected prices to rise in the days ahead. Coinglass said over $41 million of cumulative long positions were closed. Meanwhile, only $2.5 million of short positions were closed despite Bitcoin plunging, moving along the traders’ price prediction. Despite Bitcoin remaining in a bullish formation, prices have been moving inside a consolidation, failing to breach the $31,800 level recorded in mid-July 2023. Coinciding with this expansion, a United States judge had ruled to favor Ripple Labs, saying XRP was not a security, in their case against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Following this declaration, the broader crypto market edged higher, only to cool off days later. Bitcoin has been no exception, as current price action reveals. Will ETF Applications Support Prices? Still, the collapse comes a few days after the SEC accepted applications from major financial institutions, including BlackRock, a prominent Wall Street giant, to launch Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). News of BlackRock applying for a Bitcoin ETF previously triggered a bull run, pumping prices to 2023 highs. Bitcoin remains bullish as prices remain within the leg-up established from June 15 to July 13. Even though fundamental factors could support prices, BTC may edge lower should bulls fail to prop up prices and push them within the consolidation of the better half of July 2023. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Transfers To Exchanges Suggest More Selling Pressure For ETH Technically, a close above $31,800 and July 13 highs may drive the coin towards the $36,000 zone and later $43,000 in a buy trend continuation formation.

15260690,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=544137,1690245385,This Technical Signal Says Bitcoin Dominance Has Potentially Peaked,"Altcoin sentiment is at extreme lows, but that’s not the only thing reaching extremes. Bitcoin dominance, a measure of the top cryptocurrency by market cap’s weight compared to the rest of the space, also reached the most extreme reading ever on a technical indicator known for its precise timing and ability to pin-point reversals. If accurate, it’s only a matter of time until altcoins once again outperform BTC. Why The 50% Level In Bitcoin Dominance Is Critical In recent weeks, BTC dominance reached above 50% — an important psychological level in the relationship between Bitcoin and altcoins. While the metric has been much higher — and lower — in the past, the idea that one coin is the size of all others combined is a massive accomplishment. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Continuation Pattern Points To 3-6 Months Of Uptrend Ahead But after reaching only 2% above the 50% zone, Bitcoin dominance has struggled to push any higher and found resistance. The first signs of a possible reversal began as XRP was deemed not a security by a US judge. Since then, the relationship between Bitcoin and alts has since switch course. The change in course coincides with the Fisher Transform flipping downward from the most extreme reading in the history of 2W BTC.D charts. The Fisher is turning down from +4 std. deviation | BTC.D on TradingView.com The Fisher Transform Forecasts A Potential Altcoin Season The Fisher Transform, created by John Elhers, converts price action into a Gaussian normal distribution in order to better highlight precise turning points in markets. The tool’s readings are based on a standard deviation, where readings on the most extreme side of the bell curve are rare, and thus have a higher probability of reversal once the signal turns down. Such moves to extremes require enormous strength behind the underlying trend. But even the most powerful trends must eventually come to an end. Related Reading: Perfect Storm: Why Bitcoin & Crypto Are Poised For A Dramatic Recovery Reversing down from the highest point in 2W BTC.D history could suggest the trend favoring Bitcoin has ended, and the altcoins will perform better for the foreseeable future.

42392965,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgEHA5,1690243243,Crypto Catalysts: Rate Hike Looms as FOMC Begins Latest Monetary Policy Deliberations,"For 16 months, the U.S. Federal Reserve has been long on inflation anxiety and short on interest rate surprises.  On Tuesday, the central bank’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which sets monetary policy, will begin deliberations that will likely continue this trend the following day with a 25 basis point rate hike and lots of teeth-gnashing about the continued threat of inflation.  The CME Rate Watch tool is currently forecasting a 98% probability of another quarter point increase that would raise the federal funds rate to a range of 525 to 550 basis points – its highest level in roughly 17 years. The FOMC suspended its 15-month diet of monetary tightening last month, briefly raising investor hopes that it had turned dovish for the foreseeable future. But in a statement following its decision, the bank suggested that inflation remained concerning and that further rate hiking was possible.  “In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook,” FOMC said. “The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations as well as financial and international developments.

With a few blips, bitcoin has been trading in a range between $29,000 and $31,500 for much of the past two months. It was recently changing hands at $29,100, down more than 3% over the past 24 hours. ""It will take a fresh catalyst to excite bitcoin traders,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in a Monday note.  On Tuesday, the Conference Board will release its latest Consumer Confidence Index (CCI), which reflects sentiment about the economy. Thursday reports on jobless claims will offer the latest data on economic growth, while Friday’s Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), a favored inflation measure of the Federal Reserve, could buttress the bank’s latest move – or not.  FOMC Party  The Federal Reserve will take its latest steps in trying to reduce inflation to its long-sought goal of 2%. The June 3% reading continued an encouraging trend, slightly beating expectations and dropping from 4% in May. Just a year ago, inflation was roaring at 9%. Still, the Fed has remained fretful about a still sizzling job market that typically dovetails with rising prices and a stubbornly high core PCE. In remarks to the House Financial Services Committee a week after the Fed halted rate hikes, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that “nearly all FOMC participants expect that it will be appropriate to raise interest rates somewhat further by the end of the year.”  Consumer Confidence Index  Last month, the CCI soared to 109, up seven points from May and its highest level since January 2022 as consumers exulted over the vibrant jobs market and a lower likelihood of recession. The current consensus is for the CCI to rise to 112. One potentially bitter note: The Conference Board survey also found that consumers haven’t entirely ruled out the possibility of recession.  Jobless Claims  Last week’s jobless claims turned for the worse last week, at least for analysts and investors hoping for signs the job market would cool. The 228,000 first-time jobless claims for the week ending July 15 were about 9,000 fewer than the previous week and lower than expectations. The forecast is for first-time claims for the week ending July 22 will rise to 235,000, a small number that is unlikely to unsettle asset markets.  Read More: Initial Jobless Claims Suggest Continued Fed Tightening, but Investors Appear Unfazed  Durable Goods  May durable goods orders rose 1.7%, their third consecutive, monthly gain, offering another sign that the U.S. economy was doing anything but shrinking. Expectations are for a 1.5% rise when the Census Bureau publishes June data.  Personal Consumption Expenditures  PCE has declined steadily over the past year, another upbeat signal for inflation watchers. May’s 3.8 reading, year-over-year, was down from over 5% at the start of the year. Core PCE, which strips away more volatile food and energy costs, has seesawed between 4.6% and 4.7% the past three months, a less optimistic trend that has concerned the Fed, although expectations are for a 4.2% reading in June.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,James Rubin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/25/crypto-catalysts-likely-rate-hike-on-the-menu-as-fomc-begins-latest-monetary-policy-deliberations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a7a2f93a900ccffe33854b42d14c531ccc5e82e3-1152x648.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
15259845,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=544170,1690243200,"Bitcoin Critical Support Level: Can It Hold $29,250 Before Monthly Candle Close?","Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s largest cryptocurrency, has experienced a sharp decline recently, mirroring the broader decline in the cryptocurrency market. This has led to concerns among Bitcoin bulls, who closely monitor the cryptocurrency’s price movements to determine whether the decline will continue or stabilize the market. Downside Volatility Threatens BTC’s Support According to crypto analyst Rekt Capital, Bitcoin is hovering below a critical support level of $29,250. This is a crucial threshold for Bitcoin bulls, as a sustained breach of this level could trigger a macro trend shift and lead to a retest of lower support lines. Rekt Capital notes that Bitcoin has over a week to continue holding this support level, with the July Monthly Candle Close as an essential milestone. However, the analyst also warns that there is plenty of time for the market to shake out investors with downside volatility below this level potentially. BTC currently trades at $29,000, with the $29,250 50-day Moving Average (MA) being momentarily lost. This aligns with Bitcoin’s squeeze momentum indicator, which points to a downtrend cycle. Historically, such cycles have resulted in a consolidation period of 15 to 30 days after a sharp decline like the one BTC experienced recently.

Nonetheless, if the current downtrend persists, the only notable support lines would be at $28,200, $28,100, $27,200, and the 200-day MA, which is critical for Bitcoin’s long-term trend and currently at $26,800. Bulls need to hold the 200-day MA, as losing it could compromise the current bullish trend. Bitcoin On The Edge On the other hand, the broader cryptocurrency market is under pressure ahead of Wednesday’s upcoming interest rate decision. However, according to the crypto trader known as The Wolf Of Few Streets, Bitcoin’s support levels at 28,800 and 28,300 should prevent a significant fall. The trader believes that the Bitcoin market has already priced in the expected increase. Ideally, the market should bounce off one of these levels and test $32,000 again after the interest rate data is released on Wednesday.

The trader sees no immediate negatives for BTC and believes that a minor liquidation of long positions has been long overdue, making the timing for a decline perfect. However, The Wolf Of Few Streets does not expect this decline to last long. Overall, The Wolf Of Few Streets remains bullish on Bitcoin and believes the current market pressure is temporary. The trader’s analysis suggests that the support levels will hold, and positive news regarding ETF decisions could provide further support.
