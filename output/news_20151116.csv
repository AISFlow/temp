42398815,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbggwX,1447714212,FinCEN Developed Bitcoin Training for IRS Tax Examiners,"The US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has reportedly been working with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to develop bitcoin training programs for tax examiners.  During a speech given today at the ABA/ABA Money Laundering Enforcement Conference in Washington, DC, FinCEN director Jennifer Shasky Calvery said that the agency, one of several in the US with jurisdiction over elements of the bitcoin ecosystem, recently collaborated with the IRS to educate its examiners on relevant aspects of the technology.  She remarked:  ""IRS has an extensive training program for its examiners, and FinCEN often participates in, or otherwise contributes to, these training programs. In the virtual currency space, FinCEN worked recently with IRS to design and implement a training program for IRS examiners.""  Calvery later highlighted FinCEN's ongoing examinations of US digital currency companies, which she said will ""determine whether virtual currency exchangers and administrators are meeting their compliance obligations under the applicable rules"".  She also pointed to FinCEN's 2015 enforcement action against Ripple in highlighting how the agency will move against industry firms it believes are in violation of federal law.  ""Where we identify problems ... we will use our supervisory and enforcement authorities to appropriately penalize non-compliance and drive compliance improvements,"" she said.  Conference attention  Calvery's speech wasn't the only time during the three-day conference that the subject of bitcoin has come up, however.  According to a schedule published on the conference's website, a panel convened both yesterday and today focused on how fraud and anti-money laundering risks are evolving ""due to the speed of mobile payments, increase in social technologies, and growth of cryptocurrencies"".  Hosted by JPMorgan & Chase executive director for Global KYC Aaron Borst, speakers included Microsoft senior director of compliance André Burrell, BuckleySandler LLP counsel Amy Kim and William Voorhees, head of Silicon Valley Bank Financial Group's financial intelligence and high-risk business management efforts.

42398826,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgh9K,1447708530,Interpol Event to Discuss Bitcoin's Role in Illicit Asset Trade,"A spokesperson for India’s Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), its top law enforcement agency, has revealed bitcoin and digital currencies will be an area of focus during an upcoming conference organized by Interpol to be held in India.  Running from 17th to 19th November, the sixth-annual Global Focal Point Conference on Asset Recovery will more broadly focus on fighting corruption and financial crime.  According to statements from Interpol, measures to be discussed will include a new global police alerts system that would help global agencies better trace and recover stolen assets.  However, a new report by The Economic Times indicates that the CBI has said digital currency and its role in facilitating trade on the dark web will be discussed. While not quoted directly, CBI spokesperson Devpreet Singh reportedly said the technology has caused concerns among law enforcement agencies for its growing use in cybercrime.  The conference is organized by Interpol as well as the Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative, a partnership between the World Bank and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime established in 2007.  Interpol has emerged as one of the more active law enforcement organizations looking at illicit use cases for digital currencies. To faciliate study the technology, Interpol created its own digital currency and held the first of a planned series of training session on the subject in August.  Most recently, Interpol announced it would work with Europol, the European Union’s top law enforcement agency, to investigate crimes involving digital currency usage.

42398819,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbggxW,1447704631,A Possible Digital Currency Scam is Using JPMorgan's Branding,"A possible cryptocurrency scam is using JPMorgan & Chase's branding – and the bank isn’t happy about it.  In a message posted to its Chinese-language website, JPMorgan disavowed any relationship with the so-called ""JPMCoin"" or ""Morgan Dollars"", a virtual currency currently being pitched via Chinese social media platforms.  The bank said in the statement:  “JPM Coin is not a product of JPMorgan Chase nor of any of its affiliates in China or elsewhere. JPMorgan Chase has not authorised any virtual currency (of this type or similar in any way). JPMorgan Chase has not authorized references to JPMorgan, JPMorgan Chase or Morgan in any way.”  One website  associated with ""JPMCoin"" detailed how the cryptocurrency had been created more than a year ago. The website, which was accessible as of this morning, is no longer operational, stating that ""this account has been suspended"".  Another website  associated with the virtual currency sports a discussion forum and outlines a related cloud mining service for JPMCoin.  A Facebook group for JPMCoin includes a series of posts from 3rd October. In the first post on the group page, JPMCoins are described as a rare market opportunity available only to ""members"" – terminology that points to the likelihood that it is a multi-level marketing scheme akin to Gemcoin and Onecoin.  JPMCoin appears to have grown out of an earlier digital currency scheme pitch called ""BBTCoin"", according to social media posts, which use similar language to those later pitching JPMCoin.  Other posts claim that JPMorgan is as an ""investor"" in the cryptocurrency.  In the wake of the warnings, it appears the project is shifting its branding away from the JPMorgan association. According to a post on the JPMMP.com forum, the cryptocurrency is being rebranded as ""Beta Coins"".  An earlier post on the now-suspended JPMCoin site also alluded to this change.

42398823,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgh6N,1447695325,BTCS Filing: ‘Substantial Doubt’ About Bitcoin Firm’s Future,"Bitcoin mining firm BTCS has indicated there are concerns within the public company’s management about its ability to sustain operations.  As noted in its latest quarterly SEC filing, BTCS believes it will require ""significant additional capital"" to sustain short-term operations as well as long-term plans. The company cited recurring operating losses and net operating cash flow deficits as reasons for the lack of optimism about its prospects.  ""Because of recurring operating losses, net operating cash flow deficits, and an accumulated deficit, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern,"" the filing reads.  The document continues:  “The Company will require significant additional capital to sustain its short-term operations and make the investments it needs to execute its longer term business plan. The company’s existing liquidity is not sufficient to fund its operations and anticipated capital expenditures for the foreseeable future.""  BTCS said it plans to finance its activities by seeking additional funds through the sale of securities, as well as increasing revenue from its bitcoin mining efforts, though it warned debt or equity financing were unlikely to come on favorable terms.  The filing indicates BTCS experienced a net loss of $3.8m during the third-quarter of 2015, and that its net loss for the nine months ending 30th September equalled $8.4m. The figures were up from the $2.5 quarterly net loss and $6.6m year-to-date net loss observed in 2014.  Launched as a consumer-facing e-commerce portal specializing in bitcoin, BTCS has shifted its operations in 2015 in an effort to enter the industrial mining market, merging with Israel-based bitcoin mining firm Spondoolies-Tech earlier this year.  The latest filing found BTCS earned $169,000 from its mining efforts in Q3, though after expenses it obtained only $67,000 in gross profit.  As of 30th September, BTCS indicated it had $2.3m in current assets and $2.3m in liabilities. The Nevada-based company reported a net loss of $4.59m for the first half of 2015.  At press time, the company's stock was trading for just over 12 cents per share.

42398818,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgh0T,1447691721,Bank of Canada: Bitcoin Could Create 'New Monetary Order',"Central banks would ""struggle"" to implement monetary policy in a world where digital currencies are more widely used, a senior official from the Bank of Canada said in a speech last week.  During an appearance at the Rotman School of Management and Munk School of Global Affairs in Toronto, senior deputy governor Carolyn Wilkins spoke about innovation and the changing face of central banking in a post-financial crisis world.  Wilkins pointed to bitcoin as part of a landscape of alternative financial technologies and concepts that she said are pushing more and more financial activity ""outside the traditional financial sector"".  She said in the speech:  ""This would create a new dynamic in the global monetary order, one in which central banks would struggle to implement monetary policy. And, central banks couldn’t act as lenders of last resort as they do for their own currencies. This means that households and businesses could suffer important losses if such an e-money were to crash.""  ""We need to anticipate this and manage the risks and benefits that could arise from the broader adoption of e-money,"" she concluded.  Last week’s speech wasn’t the first by Wilkins to address bitcoin. Wilkins said during a speech last year that the Bank of Canada was watching industry developments ""closely"", and that one possible outcome of the technology is a reduction in capacity to conduct central bank policy.  ""In the unlikely situation in which cryptocurrencies were used broadly, a significant proportion of economic transactions would not be denominated in Canadian dollars,"" she said at the time. ""This would reduce the bank's ability to influence macroeconomic activity through Canadian interest rates.""  The comments echo those that have been formally issued by Bank of Canada itself, as the central bank said last year that digital currencies may pose a threat to central bank stability.

42398824,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgh4P,1447690114,Amazon Starts Shipping 21 Bitcoin Computers,"Online retail giant Amazon is now shipping 21 Bitcoin Computers, the first product from the industry’s best-funded startup 21 Inc.  21  began accepting orders on 21st September, when it revealed the offering along with its broader vision for how it believes the 21 Bitcoin Computer will be used to further development in the field of machine-to-machine payments.  Unlike past products aimed at the bitcoin mining market, 21 reiterated in a new blog post it does not intend for its units, which contribute to transaction processing on the bitcoin blockchain, to be optimized for the speculative mining of bitcoins. Rather, the units will aim to provide users a ""stream of bitcoins”, a move that aims to emphasize that bitcoins, while a scarce and valuable resource, are effectively the data that runs the distributed bitcoin database.  So far, the product has perhaps struggled to communicate its nuances even to its target consumers in the development community. Confusion over the value of the product as well as its high price point can be seen in comments on social media sites and on Amazon.  In the post, 21 CEO Balaji Srinivasan aimed to reiterate the product's value, adding:  ""It’s an integrated hardware/software device that is built to connect to other devices of its kind, to be updated in sync, and to integrate with an online developer community. It provides a stream of bitcoin to buy digital goods and services, the ability to set up simple micropayment servers to sell these goods, and a set of demonstration apps along with the libraries to build your own.""  Products were expected to begin shipment on 16th November, according to Amazon’s official product page, and soon after, Reddit users began reporting that they had received confirmation emails from the e-commerce company. 21 later confirmed shipment had begun via Twitter.  An informal poll conducted on Twitter by CoinDesk indicated that not all purchasers had received confirmation emails. At press time, only 30% of the poll’s 27 respondents had indicated they had received notice their product had shipped.  The shipping deadline may have added importance for 21 Inc and its reputation given the long-standing issues industry startups have had delivering consumer mining products. In the past, Butterfly Labs, KnCMiner, HashFast and a litany of other mining firms have suffered from shipping delays, poor customer feedback, and ultimately, lawsuits and bankruptcy filings.  At press time, 21 Inc did not respond to requests for further clarity on its shipping timelines.
