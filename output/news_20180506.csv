""It's a good card to pull.""  The Four of Wands.  In front of me – my life – there's good times, happiness, good fortune.  Reading from an online tarot card symbology site, my friend and tonight my forecaster says, ""If you have been working on a project, this card indicates you will reach an important milestone and will have cause to celebrate. You have completed a significant phase of the project and can feel very proud of what you have accomplished so far.""  She continues:  ""A vision beginning to be realized.""  Who knew my time living around a bunch of ""witches"" in Colorado would parlay so well into my time in cryptocurrency today?  When asked about the hand:shake pre-ICO launch party – where delights included face painting, a palm reader and some mysterious ""restoration"" practice called Jaguar Awakening – someone at the event said, ""It was offensively lavish and not very smart.""  Harsh. Not unbelievable.  There were nerds and anarchists and conspiracy theorists in cryptocurrency not but a year ago. They're still here, of course. But they've been drowned out recently by the hippies and spirituals and soothsayers.  And they're quite like the psychics I saw in Colorado, living in small cluttered apartments with hundreds of little vials of oils – pine needles and rose buds and seeds soaking in the mixture – filling the cabinets, whose doors are kept open.  Everything is for sale, but not because they want to sell it, but because if you're suffering from anxiety, depression, a broken heart even, the oils can soothe whatever ails you.  There's no harm in a $40 bottle of olive oil mixed with cinnamon and eucalyptus, just like there's no harm in the 10 cent private key these new age prophets are slinging.  Slinging by the millions.  So what? What a deal. The industry says they'll be worth more than that bottle of oil at some point, and not only worth more by price but have a utility you'll want in your future digital life.  Maybe I will. Maybe you will. Maybe A16z will.  There is a problem, though.  Another friend of mine, a tarot reader told her she would get married by 23. Six months before that birthday, she had no boyfriend, no prospects even and was freaking out. Those words ate at her.  ""What if I missed it?""  She had to see another reader.  Drunkenly the next night, we stumbled into a basement shop, a small neon light in the window, blinking the words.  It wasn't tarot, but palmistry.  But her palms, they had no such ideas of marriage at such a ripe young age. Instead, they spelled out adventure and travel and big changes.  All was well.  She didn't miss it. It was never there.  It's not hard to get wrapped up in the cards, or the lines, or the aura. It's actually surprisingly easy. Because we're all looking for answers to questions we cannot answer when we want the answers.  You can be OK with not knowing. That's the only way I've found even a tiny bit of solace in my life.  But it's a struggle.  It's the same struggle the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry deals with every day.  ""What is this all for?""  And without the answers laid neatly before them in the real world, they've turned to all varieties of pseudoscience and a whole assortment of charlatans.  For god's sake, Deepak Chopra, the popular Jesus figure of the New Age and alternative medicine movements, whose ideas have negatively affected people's understanding of science, is leading a meditation at ConsenSys' Ethereal Summit this year.  And it's not offensive to me that some human would lead meditation, it's offensive that some company would pay this human (who has turned a fun, soothing activity into a fear-based cash cow) tens of thousands of dollars that they've made because people believe in the company's idea to lead a meditation at a conference that's theoretically supposed to be about understanding what the fuck all this crypto shit is for.  But we've said it for some time now, ""Blockchain is a product looking for a solution.""  It's looking for an answer.  The industry is looking for an answer … to why people have quit their kush jobs in banking to join the ranks of startups, to why people have invested billions of dollars – even dollars they can't actually afford to lose – in projects that are only an idea in some nerdy millennial's mind, to why people like me seem to care so much about seeing the technology prosper … and today, they'll use any mechanism, no matter how fraudulent, to prove it.  ""Oh shit.""  My friend, all the sudden realizes (we've had a few glasses of wine), facing towards me The Four of Wands is in reverse – upside down.  ""This changes things.""  See in tarot, a card in reverse speaks a different truth, the opposite truth.  ""The Four of Wands reversed suggests uncertainty about what you can and cannot depend on. You may be placed in a situation which appeases your immediate concerns but does not solve the longer-term issues.""  Millions made. But scaling. Governance. Generally cryptocurrency and blockchain's existential crisis.  ""Is there a situation, a relationship even, that you feel insecure about,"" my friend asks rhetorically.  She knows what's going on – (at the time) I'm about to move to New York for a job I know will be a slog, especially given my current life spending my mornings hiking around Pike's Peak and my evenings, drinking wine and waxing philosophical with good friends and a boyfriend.  I give her a knowing look.  The same look I give now to the token issuers who tell me how great it's going to be to put diamonds or marriage licenses or music on ""the blockchain.""  But they don't seem to acknowledge it. Not like she does.  She knows she can speak to my very essence.  They are still trying to speak to my fingers moving across a keyboard because they want those fingers to speak to someone's wallet, because they just want a little more time to figure out why they've come to put all their effort into something so ephemeral.  You can poke fun at it. It's easy enough to.  But if you roll your eyes too hard, you might miss the point.  Or you might also save yourself a lot of stress, heartache and turmoil.  Who knows?

42380652,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8yerr,1525599917,Meetup's Crypto Secret? Scams Are Running Rampant,"The line between crypto education and self-promotion has blurred.  And nowhere is this more evident than on social media, where imposters are everywhere and scams are rampant. But as crypto Twitter devolves into all-out chaos, a similar deterioration of discourse is playing out on another popular site for crypto enthusiasts – Meetup.com, the startup acquired by co-working giant WeWork for $200 million in 2017.  Take James Moreau's experience. The founder of the Worcester Ethereum Meetup had a self-proclaimed blockchain expert interrupt one of his recent meetings focused on how to use cryptocurrency wallets by passing out flyers for a crypto accounting service. Thinking it was inappropriate, Moreau stopped the solicitation but was later horrified to discover the accountant didn't actually have any experience reporting crypto assets.  Yet, some of the more inexperienced group members had been quick to take the stranger at her word.  And Moreau felt some responsibility, not only for their potential wasted time but also the fact that should any of those members purchase her services, and then have problems later because she, in fact, didn't know what she was doing.  This experience displays just how difficult it's become to run a Meetup group related to cryptocurrency or blockchain, and moreover to educate in any form in the space.  ""Around a month or two ago, I started noticing the same type of spam you'd see on Twitter,"" Moreau said, listing questionable exchange links, giveaways and phishing scams among the culprits he sees on Meetup.  He continued:  ""I've deleted the comments and blocked the users, but they keep coming.""  Meetup's policy currently forbids groups that offer ""specific advice or services in areas that require a licensed professional,"" including law and finance, as well as groups that promise ""financial gains."" But when it comes to the nascent cryptocurrency space, it can be tricky to separate education from blatant scams and misinformation.  So far, Moreau has dealt with about a half dozen problematic posts and direct messages, but he can't be sure how many scammy direct messages have been sent to the 97 members of his Worcester group.  ""I have people in my groups that are new and don't know what a scam looks like in this space,"" he said, describing newbies punch-drunk on headlines about quick riches as a ripe target for opportunists.  Online solicitation  And what's more problematic is when users directly solicit others via the comments section of Meetup groups.  For instance, a Meetup user calling himself ""Stellar Lumens"" promised users of the platform an ""invite bonus"" of lumens, the native cryptocurrency of the stellar protocol, even following up with people on Facebook before Meetup shut down the solicitor's account.  Zac Freundt, community manager at the Stellar Development Foundation, told CoinDesk the team routinely reports such scams on Meetup and other social media platforms.  While this bad behavior appears far less common on Meetup.com, Moreau said reporting scams (which the company has encouraged him to keep doing) is taking up a lot of his time.  As such, he isn't sure whether he'll keep using the platform if the problem persists. In his eyes, some of the responsibility lies with the platform itself.  ""It's a paid service, so I feel like there should be some level of service,"" he told CoinDesk, adding:  ""I'm thinking about whether Meetup is a good platform for me to organize around anymore, then again, I don't know what my options are otherwise.""  Meetup did not reply to requests for comment.  Currently, Moreau is hoping to address some of the issuers by exploring an option to review prospective members before allowing them to join the group.  Lawson Baker, a former attorney turned founder of the cryptocurrency consulting firm RelayZero, echoed Moreau, saying Meetup.com should deal with these scammy and spammy issues, whether through moderation policies or other solutions.  Although, the moves of platforms like Facebook, which banned all advertisements related to cryptocurrency, are also not the best solution.  ""It's a fine line to walk between censorship and consumer protection,"" said Moreau. ""Somebody sharing their opinion about cryptocurrency could be misconstrued as spam or financial advice. I don't know what the best solution is yet.""  In-person pumps  It's not only online where promotion is a concern.  Going one step further from Moreau's example, a Stellar Meetup in San Francisco in April left Baker feeling uneasy.  During that Meetup, hosted by Boris Reznikov, director of partnerships at Stellar, the co-founders of real estate startup Slice not only talked about what the company's aims were but also offered a demonstration of its tokenized assets and referred to upcoming portfolio options.  The event's comment section is full of people posting links to similar blockchain projects and asking about free lumen giveaways.  According to Freundt, ""Our meetups are purely focused on educating the public about the technology and use cases of stellar. We do not offer any investment advice.""  But Baker said the Slice executive's presentation kind of was.  ""They put all the disclaimers that this was not a solicitation. Even though, honestly, that's basically what they are doing,"" he told CoinDesk.  On the other hand, though, startup pitches and discussions about what crypto assets have real long-term value are a normal and much-needed part of the cryptocurrency community. A Slice spokesperson told CoinDesk the presentation was merely a technical demonstration, and that the startup is focused on high net worth individuals, not retail investors.  Still, Baker said organizers of these events have to be careful and vet guest speakers diligently.  ""There's always bad actors, and then there's a whole bunch of stuff that is just really bad projects. Sometimes it's hard to identify that in a three-minute talk on why you should invest in it,"" Baker said.  As such, Hannah Rosenberg, co-organizer of the Bitcoin & Open Blockchain Meetup group in Chicago, which has more than 2,550 members, takes a more stringent approach.  ""We don't do ICO stuff,"" Rosenberg told CoinDesk, adding:  ""I've no problem with it in theory. But some of what has been going on is madness. So we just don't touch ICOs.""
