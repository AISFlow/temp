42403941,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdh4eP,1580855732,What Is Going On With Jae Kwon and Cosmos?,"""If something should happen to me, be critical and share your opinions respectfully. But everything I’m doing is in fact making me a target,"" Jae Kwon, the main architect of the Cosmos protocol, wrote on Twitter on Jan. 21.      Kwon’s varied fixations have been a topic of conversation among crypto-community insiders. But it’s been much more than idle chatter for the staffers of the startup building the software that makes Cosmos work.      Internal tensions have begun to spill out into public view, precipitated by a story from Decrypt on Jan. 29 reporting Kwon was stepping down as CEO to focus on a new project.      A source with knowledge of the matter tells CoinDesk Kwon is not only the CEO of Tendermint (which is also known as All in Bits Inc.), he is also the sole board member. That means all the authority in a company that has backing from Bain Capital Ventures, Paradigm and 1confirmation rests in Kwon. Whether that’s still the case remains unknown.      Cosmos responded to a request for comment by asking that CoinDesk submit questions in writing, but then declined to answer them. A spokesperson said the Cosmos team ""will provide an update as soon as they are in a position to do so.""    Interoperability interrobang    Cosmos is one of the leading projects aimed at enabling different blockchains and their native assets to communicate with each other. Its top rival is arguably Polkadot, a similar network being developed by ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood’s Parity Technologies and the Web3 Foundation.      While Polkadot has only launched its experimental Kusama network, Cosmos appeared to be in the lead in the interoperability race, with its software launching last March. Amid the Kwon drama, Anchorage, a crypto-custodian affiliated with Facebook's Libra project, announced Tuesday it would provide custody services for ATOM, the Cosmos token, and allow its users to earn returns by participating in staking.      CoinDesk reported in November on the financial health of the project, but as uncertainty swirls around its leader Cosmos’ market standing appears to be in question. Is Kwon still leading the project? Has he been distracted by other interests? Is everything OK?      Kwon responded to Decrypt’s report by calling it ""FUD"" in a GitHub post the following day. Writing in the third person on his personal GitHub account, Kwon said there were plans to “eliminate the role of the CEO.” Further, he wrote:    ""Tendermint Inc. organizational structure today comprises a sole decision factor, which is Jae Kwon, in his role of company's CEO. Jae and company has decided that moving forward the company will adopt a more decentralized corporate ‘Process’ that is being developed along with the Virgo project.""  What’s Virgo?    Little noticed before last week, Kwon has been at work on a new project he describes as complementary to the Cosmos blockchain: Virgo.      While what Virgo will do is not very clear, its aims are very lofty. Unveiled at the CryptoEconomics Security Conference in late October, Virgo right now is a manifesto hosted on GitHub.      ""We are surrounded by fire,"" is the document’s first line.      The manifesto goes on to address everything from social services, the financial system, privacy, open source software, taxation and the environment.      “Time is in short supply. We are dealing with an apocalyptic set of unfolding tragedies,” it reads.      Shortly after revealing Virgo, Kwon offered via Twitter to help Greta Thunberg on her campaign to address climate change, using Tendermint. Thunberg did not reply.      Meanwhile, Kwon has also been seemingly fixated on Libra. His company was a founding member of the OpenLibra coalition, for example, though he recently walked that commitment back on Twitter.      In late November, he wrote a thread on Twitter about how to rule the world in just 12 steps, envisioning an Elizabeth Warren presidency that would end in a devil's bargain between the White House and Facebook such that universal basic income launches over Libra, supporting people and certain ""approved businesses.""      A month later, Kwon would decide to adopt a new persona on Twitter to supplement the one associated with him as a company founder. In early December the account @BitcoinJaesus first appeared, writing: ""The consequence of the theory of special relativity is information theory.""      He's currently tweeting under multiple accounts, including @jaekwon, @jaesustein and @BitcoinJaesus. Fortunately, all of these retweet each other fairly liberally.      As of this writing, the @BitcoinJaesus account is focused on convincing followers the Wuhan coronavirus is a weaponized infection, dramatically worse than what has been described so far. (To be fair, this is not the only prominent account on Crypto Twitter espousing such views.)    Rebellion    Meanwhile, people within Kwon’s company have come to find his behavior untenable, according to the same source speaking on the condition of anonymity. This has been raised with him multiple ways internally, the source said, though until this week no one felt safe going public with their concerns.      In September, the company had a staff retreat that did not go well, the source added. People expressed frustration both with how the company was being run and how they were being treated.      On Monday, Zaki Manian, director of Tendermint Labs, went public with his position in a strongly worded thread on Twitter.      ""Over the last 6 months, Jae has obsessively focused on Virgo while neglecting and under resourcing IBC,"" Manian wrote.      Manian is probably the best-known person in the Cosmos project outside of Kwon himself, frequently speaking about the network at conferences and on panels. He gave the update on Cosmos alongside Kwon, for example, at Consensus 2019.      Manian’s Twitter thread goes on to point to the @jaesustein and @BitcoinJaesus personas as creating problems both with current staff and with recruiting new talent.      Later in the thread, Manian writes, ""For the past month, Jae has subjected every internal communication channel to religious discrimination, loyalty tests and abusive rants.""      A source within the company corroborated Manian's view, describing an adversarial environment at Tendermint and a staff beset by a series of crises Kwon refuses to address.      Manian has so far declined to comment further to CoinDesk. Of Cosmos’ investors, 1confirmation has replied to CoinDesk about the controversy, noting internal tensions can be ""a positive signal.""      Kwon tweeted on Jan. 19, ""People keep asking me why I keep bombing my reputation. I think I’m investing in a new one and showing where I give my fucks...""",NEUTRAL,ATOM,ATOM | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | DOT | TECHNOLOGY,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/02/04/what-is-going-on-with-jae-kwon-and-cosmos,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f3f07dfe5462384eda4d3a7c458589f3a40955a3-2048x1269.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403934,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdh4WX,1580851116,Iowa Caucus App Fiasco Shows Need for Open Source Transparency,"The Iowa caucuses were thrown into disarray as reports surfaced an opaque app used to tabulate the results and report them to Democratic Party officials was reporting only part of the required data. Although the app had been developed to improve efficiency in communicating the final caucus tallies, it ended up causing significant delays. According to security experts, the incident served to highlight the risks of relying on digital systems and the centralization of information, and a lack of transparency regarding these systems.      On Tuesday morning, Iowa Democratic Party Chair Troy Price released a statement defending the caucus, saying the underlying data recorded was accurate and that due to paper records party officials were able to double-check the data.      Reporting issues were “due to a coding issue in the reporting system. This issue was identified and fixed. The application’s reporting issue did not impact the ability of precinct chairs to report data accurately.”      A 2019 report from Veramatrix, a software security company, said it is considered acceptable for there to be between 15 and 50 errors per 1,000 lines of code. The average app is comprised of 50,000 lines of code, which would translate to an industry-accepted average of 2,500 errors.      “The error rate or bug density varies between apps. It depends on the security education the app developers have, the quality of code testing and reviews,” said Asaf Ashkenazi, Veramatrix’s chief operating officer. “For example, in the Iowa Democratic Party case, based on reports, it seems the testing process was not adequate.”      While this may be an acceptable level of risk for, say, Candy Crush, it’s a different matter when the app is handling primary election data. And those risks were compounded by the fact that little information about the app was made publicly available in advance of the caucuses. The Iowa Democratic Party refused to divulge the name of the app, but it was developed by Shadow, a Democratic technology firm. In a statement, the company said “the underlying data and collection process via Shadow’s mobile caucus app was sound and accurate, but our process to transmit that caucus results data generated via the app to the IDP was not.”      By using the app, the party introduced one more point of risk to the caucus were it to malfunction. And it did.    When something as important as an election is at stake, it is, frankly, malpractice to allow proprietary software.    Joshua Simmons, a board member of the Open Source Initiative, which promotes and protects open source software, believes software like this should necessarily be transparent.      “When something as important as an election is at stake, it is, frankly, malpractice to allow proprietary software,” Simmons said. “Open-source licensed software guarantees security researchers have access to vet and improve the software before it’s put into use.”      Simmons said trust in institutions and the systems they employ is critical to any functioning democracy and that over the last few years he’s seen growing skepticism and cynicism.      “Open source is an important step in creating transparency, cultivating trust and building more resilient systems,” he said.      The Iowa Democratic Party had declined to name the app’s developer to deter outside interference from an adversarial third party, such as Russia.      “Based on news reports, it looks like the app was not properly tested, which is alarming,” Ashkenazi said. “I believe that any app owner should make information available on what processes are being used to test its app and what technologies are used to shield the app from hackers. This practice can provide more confidence.”      This lack of transparency results not just in technical errors that subvert trust in the app, but also opens the door for misinformation and conspiracy theories to take hold.      The Bernie Sanders campaign released its own internal numbers last night, showing a Sanders victory. Pete Buttigieg declared victory before any precinct results were reported. Conspiracy theories were widespread on social media and are only likely to multiply as time goes on.      The confusion and misinformation comes amid a wider trust decline in democratic institutions is declining.      The Edelman 2020 Trust Barometer, which measures people’s level of trust in institutions, found that people today grant their trust based on competence (which they define as “delivering on promises”) and ethical behavior (which they define as “doing the right thing and working to improve society”). The report found that neither business nor the government is seen as competent and ethical. Will the Iowa caucuses only reinforce this?      The idea of blockchain in voting as a way to immutably tally results has garnered support from some in the blockchain community while drawing fire from cybersecurity experts. My colleague Adam Levine wrote today about what role blockchain may have been able to play here, and he says that while it may have helped in some aspects, it certainly would not have fixed the fundamental issues at play.      Decentralized solutions reduce our reliance on singular entities that are fallible and that, when they break, can take people’s trust in institutions with them. The app was introduced in the name of efficiency and centralizing the data, but also provided one point where, if it broke, could throw the information it contained into question.      Whether blockchain is the solution to election infrastructure weaknesses is an open question. But blockchain technology is asking whether that infrastructure is over-centralized and liable to failure. Exclusionary technologies, developed in a walled garden, evade outside scrutiny. They show the risks of relying on that status quo when it comes to our elections.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/02/04/iowa-caucus-app-fiasco-shows-need-for-open-source-transparency,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/abf98b3abab9cfdcf310e97f14768e870f5c3afd-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403946,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdh4jK,1580846407,"No, a Blockchain Wouldn’t Have Prevented the Iowa Caucus Debacle","Adam B. Levine is CoinDesk’s podcast editor. The views expressed are his own.      We'd be the first to tell you: No, a blockchain wouldn't have prevented the voting debacle in Iowa.      The question is inevitable, if at this point cringe-inducing. Inevitable because the problems that delayed the results of Monday’s Democratic presidential caucus are, conceptually, some of the same ones that blockchains (and distributed ledger technology broadly) seek to solve: a lack of transparency, centralization and inefficiency. Cringe-inducing because blockchain’s record with political elections has been iffy at best.      As of early Tuesday afternoon, the voting results, normally revealed after the caucus that night, were still unknown. The state party says the delay is necessary as it performs “quality control” and verifies digitally reported results against the underlying paper trail.      This year held some notable changes for the notoriously manual and highly decentralized caucusing process, with the introduction of an app for individual local gatherings to report their results back to the Iowa Democratic Party. Traditionally, this was done with a phone call; while that process has its flaws, this year's results make them seem almost enviable.      From all appearances, it is this new results-reporting app that is at the core of today’s chaos.      The Wall Street Journal reported:    The app was intended to help the precinct chairs record the results from each round of voting and take care of the delegate math. Then the precinct chair was supposed to use the app to send the results to the Iowa Democratic Party.But critics expressed concern about the reliability of the app given security concerns around the 2020 elections. Cybersecurity experts also roundly criticized the Iowa Democratic Party’s decision to not identify the app maker publicly or allow it to be subject to open security and reliability testing.The cybersecurity wing of the Department of Homeland Security recently offered to do some security testing on the app but the Iowa Democratic Party declined the outreach, according to people familiar with the matter. The state party has defended its plan, with officials saying in January that they were confident in their security systems and that if there were errors, the party would be able to correct them because there would also be paper records of the votes.    The presidential candidates, with their jammed schedules, looked into that void and basically all declared victory in one way or another. The lack of information created an opportunity for mass chaos that could imperil Iowa’s early, hallowed place in the political landscape.      It’s not that results weren’t known, they just weren’t known anywhere besides the local precinct level.    Blockchains add complexity    One could be forgiven, then, for asking whether and how blockchain might have helped here, since the technology is often touted as a way to add transparency and to automate paper trails.      In theory, had the reporting app used a blockchain to record the data, all reported results would have been transparent and equally available for everyone to see, from the campaigns to the media to the politicos who soak up every piece of information they can.      Of course, if any results are improper or even just incorrect, those numbers would at least initially appear valid because they’re “on the blockchain,” and any changes to them later would likely draw cries of foul play from candidates losing delegates because of corrections.      Really, though, the question is less about blockchains and more about the app being used. While there are many problems with the quirky Iowa Caucus approach to political decision making, it’s certainly a decentralized process with very few central points of failure… until you introduce a mandatory reporting app!      At that point, all that decentralization is still there for the decision-making process at the local level, but when it comes to reporting results for tabulation it’s just one app, with basically just one codebase that shares a common set of bugs.      If a precinct captain has a heart attack, there’s a second and a third and basically as many as you need who can step up and fill that role to get the job done. But when the app fails? None of that matters, the app broke so the election broke.      Blockchains won’t change that. In fact, they could and very likely would make it worse as blockchains add meaningful complexity, which means more ways things could go wrong under imperfect, real-life conditions.      The app’s failure in this case was compounded by what appears to be a late rollout of the new tech-based approach, insufficient training for the staff who’d have to use it during this critical event and limited or no practice just to see if it could work in real life.       While many in our industry would like to claim we have a solution, imagine if a blockchain-enabled voting app had been deployed with as little testing and training. All of these problems occurred in a traditional app environment and without the need to make a thousand retired precinct captains write down a 24-word seed phrase.      Even if your technology is foolproof (and again, that’s far from obvious with blockchain voting apps), when it comes in contact with the fabled early majority and beyond the problems are not technical in nature. They have much more to do with the very human processes we each use in our heads and which we’ve trained all our lives to find familiar and comfortable. Ask your grandma to write down 24 otherwise meaningless words and never lose them and you’ll likely just get her upset.      Perhaps the one valuable contribution “blockchain” can make to this situation is by teaching people to view the world through a different lens, to question concentrations of power and asymmetries of information, to carefully weigh the pros and cons of established ways of doing things.      Blockchain, in other words, asks the right questions. But in this case, it’s not the answer.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | WALLET,Adam B.

From performers who accept BTC and XRP to decentralized delivery services, Cuen and Knox explore what happens when financial companies meet censorship-resistant systems.      The biggest problem? Knox and other performers and sex workers face semi-secret discrimination from payment platforms. She recalls being shut out of PayPal early on.      ""I think it's a morality thing. I know when I got shut down on PayPal in 2014 they were like, 'Hey, you're violating our terms of service.' And I remember writing them back and being like, 'Exactly what am I doing?' I was selling socks. I was taking pictures. How is this a thing? They were just like, 'You know, we don't really like this, so we're not gonna let you do it.'""      See also: Why Lightning Payments Aren’t Clicking for Porn Companies (Just Yet)      The biggest issue, says Knox, is chargebacks.

ConsenSys said Tuesday it will “operate a software business composed of several of its products optimized for a modular stack,” including Infura, PegaSys, MetaMask, Codefi and others.      According to a source with knowledge of the matter, Tuesday’s move will let ConsenSys focus on those four core products. “It really is quite sensible to separate the two business strategies,” the source said.      The company will continue its venture work under the ConsenSys Investments banner, with a focus on “early-stage equity, liquid digital assets, and strategic opportunities where applicable,” ConsenSys said in a statement.      The firm’s enterprise-focused “Solutions” arm will now “directly support the software business,” ConsenSys said.      Led by ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, the company laid off about 13 percent of its workforce in a late-2018 restructuring dubbed “ConsenSys 2.0.” Tuesday’s move is the result of a “conclusive evaluation” of the company's projects over the past year, the source with knowledge added.

42403949,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdh4kJ,1580832625,Inside the Standards Race for Implementing FATF’s Travel Rule,"The Takeaway:  Crypto businesses are figuring out how to comply with the Financial Action Task Force’s “Travel Rule,” where all crypto transactions above a certain amount must be accompanied by identifying information.  Competing visions for the technical implementation have emerged, though there appears to be general agreement on the need for messaging standards.  Legal and operational issues will be as challenging as putting technical solutions in place.  The FATF is set to kick the tires of a range of proposed tech solutions in June 2020.    Imagine SWIFT’s interbank messaging system but for crypto.      Hardcore blockchain libertarians would probably rather not. But firms that deal in cryptocurrency have been asked to abide by the so-called “Travel Rule,” and the clock is ticking.      Although it goes against the grain to shoehorn an identity layer onto a technology specifically designed to be pseudonymous, firms have no choice if they want to abide by the law. The shape and form this will take is something the industry must agree on, and fast.      In June 2019, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global anti-money laundering (AML) watchdog, updated its guidance to explicitly state that virtual asset service providers, or VASPs, must share sender (originator) and receiver (beneficiary) information in cryptocurrency transactions above a certain threshold.      With the one-year mark fast approaching, the FATF will review progress on Travel Rule solutions at its June 2020 plenary meeting.      Meanwhile, U.S. regulator FinCEN issued its version of the regulation pertaining to VASPs in May 2019, stating that firms had 180 days to get their houses in order. This means the Travel Rule now carries the weight of law regarding U.S.-based VASPs. (VASPs are businesses that conduct the exchange, transfer or safekeeping of virtual assets, as well as activities relating to issuing or underwriting virtual assets.)      There are differences of opinion over the best technical solution, with some favoring a blockchain-based approach and others not. Equally challenging are the operational and legal hurdles crypto exchanges face in rolling out a compliant system en masse.    To DLT or not to DLT?    There are two parts to the problem. First, there needs to be some means of identifying VASPs. This could be broadly equivalent to the Bank Identifier Code (BIC) used by SWIFT or something like the International Bank Account Number (IBAN) system.      The second part of the problem concerns data transmission. The ideal solution crypto businesses and industry groups are working towards would be a standards-based and interoperable message layer between VASPs, allowing identity, authentication and messaging to be pinned onto blockchain transactions.      There are some 20-plus solutions being built to tackle the problem. Some are relatively small-scale commercial endeavors, while others involve groups of participating firms and behave more like open protocols.      Some of the offerings mentioned in the working group arena include Bitcoin Suisse’s OpenVASP, CipherTrace’s TRISA, Sygna Bridge, Netki, Shyft and KYC Chain. Dedicated crypto-sleuthing firms including Elliptic, Coinfirm and Chainalysis have all been working on this as well. Indeed, Chainalysis recently hired former FinCEN staffer Mike Mosier to help build Travel Rule capabilities.      There are proposals that favor a more traditional battle-tested approach – such as having a centralized global registry of VASP addresses as a necessary trust anchor – and then there are the solutions taking a more decentralized approach, involving blockchains or DLT.      “The assumption that blockchain must have the solution to something that is a blockchain problem may not necessarily be true – as desirable as that may be for folks at an aspirational level, philosophically,” said Siân Jones, senior partner at XReg Consulting and convener of the Joint Working Group for InterVASP Messaging Standards (JWG-IVMS).      Malcolm Wright, head of the AML Working Group at trade group Global Digital Finance said his view (and the view of some regulators) is there needs to be more than one tech provider.      “So it might be that Coinbase chooses Tech Provider A; Binance uses Provider B,” he said. “So we end up with a matrix, with smaller exchanges copying the larger ones they want to work with.”    Turning to ethereum    Switzerland’s OpenVASP project is what you might expect from a country that’s relatively advanced when it comes to meeting FATF recommendations, and has even gone beyond them in some respects.      The project is helmed by Bitcoin Suisse and also includes Lykke exchange and crypto banks Seba and Sygnum. The Swiss have taken a practical approach, building a solution the industry can start using as quickly as possible.      A key design principle for OpenVASP is decentralization, which means avoiding the mistakes of the past, say its developers, like having a single point of failure, central servers and directories. In order to achieve decentralization where it’s deemed desirable, OpenVASP is leveraging a selection of features from ethereum.      For instance, at its messaging layer, OpenVASP proposes using Whisper, ethereum’s off-chain peer-to-peer messaging system. (To be clear, the OpenVASP white paper points out other messaging systems can be used.)      Whisper employs so-called dark routing to obscure message content and sender and receiver details to observers, a bit like anonymous web browsing using Tor, making it a neat way to meet privacy requirements.      “This means that nobody would be able to understand that two VASPs are interacting with each other,” said David Riegelnig, head of risk management at Bitcoin Suisse. “With respect to competitiveness, it should be nobody's business to know which VASPs interact, as long as the VASPs comply with their Travel Rule requirements and can do their sanctions checks screening and so forth.”    Who’s in charge?    The addressing and authentication parts of the OpenVASP solution use ethereum’s decentralized public key infrastructure, meaning the VASP must deploy a smart contract that represents identity on the blockchain. Using smart contracts on ethereum creates a blockchain public key directory for the VASP and an IBAN-like numbering format: the virtual asset account number (VAAN).      “The alternative could be a global directory of VASPs with their public keys, which sounds very simple,” said Riegelnig. “But then you have to ask, ‘In which country is this server going to stand? In which jurisdiction? Who controls it?’ And so on.”      Obviously there are going to be people who are concerned that OpenVASP is tied to ethereum, Riegelnig said. “They think it’s everything on the blockchain. But the only thing we actually use on ethereum is the smart contract where you store the public key,” he said. “Then these concerns tend to get much smaller.”      OpenVASP said it is in talks with all the big exchanges and named Binance, Kraken and Bitstamp as three that are looking at its solution. Having read the other white papers, Riegelnig said that, with the possible exception of very centralized commercial projects, they all involve some intangible parts that are basically high-level ideas.      Riegelnig said OpenVASP was “on the same page” as CipherTrace when it comes to exchanging end-to-end encrypted messages and not having a persistent blockchain data layer. But elsewhere there are shortcomings, he said.      “They [CipherTrace] somehow still rely on blockchain addresses as the identifier between VASPs. That is not very practical because public blockchain addresses change all the time,” said Riegelnig. “When you have a client and you want to transfer crypto to other VASPs, it’s much easier if you can refer to this client or their account by a client number, instead of an ever-changing blockchain address number.”    Disagreements    CipherTrace’s TRISA uses public key infrastructure (PKI) and certificate authorities. A “know-your-VASP” certificate would be sent from the exchange originating a transaction to the one receiving it. These certificates would be verified through a trusted third-party certificate authority.      CipherTrace Chief Financial Analyst John Jefferies pointed out that while a certificate authority might be controlled by a central entity, there are typically multiple distributed instances and therefore does not constitute a single point of failure.      “By avoiding global directories, OpenVASP is also avoiding known good security, and betting the whole thing on the ethereum blockchain,” said Jefferies.      “The thing about public key is that there are a lot of service providers and there can be numerous competing service providers. So while it's not like the one grand VASP PKI in the sky, if one comes and another goes then people can change and they can adopt those certificates,” he said.      As far as interoperability is concerned, ethereum keys on OpenVASP can be supported by PKI, said Jefferies: PKI is extensible so the two approaches are not mutually exclusive. This speaks to a wider issue.      “Switzerland has some strict rules, but they don't have a lot of interoperability with the U.S., and so I think the interoperability in this case is an important component,” Jefferies said.    ‘SWIFT for crypto’    While firms duke it out for the best technical solution, agreeing on a standard format to handle the message payloads will simplify things, at least on one level.      “The timeline could be dramatically reduced and the costs minimized if there was an open standard, like ISO or IEEE standards,” said Jones of the InterVASP group. This would be a common universal language for the transfer of data, regardless of any national legislation, and regardless of which technological solution the VASP plugs into, she said.      The InterVASP group has been joined by a coalition of trade bodies including Global Digital Finance, the Chamber of Digital Commerce and the International Digital Asset Exchange Association (IDAXA). The goal of the InterVASP group is to have a standard in place and ready for adoption by May 8, during New York Blockchain Week.      Standardizing the underlying messaging packet is a good path to follow, said Wright of Global Digital Finance. In situations like this, something as simple as date of birth, for example, might cause problems, Wright said. DOBs could be in U.K. format, U.S. format or long-form actual format.      “If every provider chose its own format, the cost of actually deciphering it on receipt and then making sure you have accurately transposed it is quite significant,” he said. “So having even the simplest of things like that in a format that makes sense goes a long way to standardize the industry.”      Wright acknowledged the stigma around the idea of a “SWIFT for crypto,” which instantly raises hackles. “If you’ve got the same order of fields and the same name of fields, and you know how to deal with transliteration and so forth, all agreed by the industry, then that part of SWIFT, in essence, is a reasonable thing,” he said.    Call the lawyers    Exchanging personal data between VASPs in different parts of the world could require detailed legal frameworks in order to not run afoul of regulations like GDPR, said Coinfirm CEO Pawel Kuskowski.      For this reason, Coinfirm, which has also formed a working group and claims to have government backing for that endeavor, has pulled in Gibraltar-based crypto lawyer Joey Garcia, partner at ISOLAS LLP, and London-based Dean Armstrong QC, head of chambers at the 36 Group.      Coinfirm is using a high-throughput permissioned blockchain for writing the “fingerprint” of a compliant transaction, built on the enterprise-grade DLT Hyperledger Fabric. The latter employs a private channel architecture, which has been compared to private message channels on Slack.      “There are two parts to consider when you are talking about the Travel Rule,” Kuskowski said. “One is part is technological and the other is regulatory. Really anyone who is touching this has to have someone from the legal space.”      Jefferies of CipherTrace said solving the technical challenge is not any greater than the operational hurdle, or “sunrise problem” of switching on the system for 500 VASPs at once.      As G20 countries gradually begin to roll this out, increased jurisdictional arbitrage seems likely, he added.      “People are going to lean towards the countries with either weak implementation or enforcement,” Jefferies said. “It will be interesting to see how this scenario plays out.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/02/04/inside-the-standards-race-for-implementing-fatfs-travel-rule,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/80a7b0894c0d79ae0db11df77802fe44c3693de9-2560x1672.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403933,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdh4XW,1580828399,Binance Will Soon Reward Market Makers for Providing Futures Liquidity,"Cryptocurrency exchange Binance is adjusting its fee structure to get market makers to add liquidity on its futures platform.      Under the revised Binance Futures Market Maker Program, market makers will receive a negative fee for selected trading pairs, according to an official announcement on Monday. A “market maker” is a user who adds liquidity, or buying and selling limit orders in which the limit price is below/above the current market price, by placing a trade in the order book. A “market taker” is the one who takes liquidity off the market by filling a trade already placed.      Exchanges generally try to enhance liquidity on their platforms by offering makers lower fees compared to those offered to takers while filling an order. Binance, however, has upped the ante by announcing what's effectively a reward for placing market-making trades on ""select"" pairs.      Binance hasn’t yet disclosed details relating to the negative fee structure. To join the program, market makers must have 30-day trading volumes in excess of 1,000 BTC on Binance, and have ""quality market maker strategies,"" the post says. The exchange will also accept proposals with evidence of similar trading volumes on other platforms.      A weekly performance review will be imposed, based on metrics like market volumes, market-making time, bid/offer spread, total order size and order duration.      Binance's strategy shift comes as the crypto derivatives space is heating up. Regulated firms including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and Intercontinental Exchange's Bakkt recently started offering bitcoin options after they had offered futures contracts.      Binance futures went live in September 2019, with the firm's figures suggesting they've seen solid growth.      In January, Binance futures volume witnessed an 85 percent month-on-month increase, with $56 billion traded across its perpetual contract markets. Further, open interest increased 98 percent from $137 million to $271 million as of Jan. 31. Bitcoin (BTC)/tether (USDT) perpetuals remained the most invested contract, comprising 75 percent of its total open interest, according to Binance Research.      Perpetuals are no-expiry contracts that mimic a margin-based spot market and trade close to the underlying reference price.      In December, BitMEX and Binance accounted for the majority of the BTC perpetual futures market volume at $1.7 billion (40 percent) and $947 million (22.5 percent) per day, respectively, on average.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING | BNB,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/04/binance-will-soon-reward-market-makers-for-providing-futures-liquidity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8dbb1950a0118a4badeb44a73c6070259e333d8a-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403950,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdh4mH,1580822162,Bitcoin SV Sees Minor Split as Blockchain Shifts to ‘Genesis’ Upgrade,"Bitcoin SV (for Satoshi's Vision) has hard forked with apparently just one minor issue, taking its blockchain back to the first ""Genesis"" iteration of the bitcoin protocol.      The BSV network upgraded at approximately 02:00 UTC Tuesday, implementing Genesis rules that bring about ""the full restoration of Satoshis Bitcoin protocol."" Jimmy Nguyen, president of the Bitcoin Association and bitcoin SV advocate, tweeted, adding the ""historic moment"" had been confirmed at block 620539.      By rolling out the original bitcoin protocol first released by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, the Genesis fork removes the default hard cap for block sizes, reportedly removing limits for transaction capacity and increasing on-chain scalability.      Doing away with the hard cap allows businesses to build ""large-scale applications"" on BSV, the project said Tuesday. A change in the bitcoin scripting language, they add, will enable the protocol to perform functions – like smart contracts – and potentially allow the project to compete with blockchain projects such as ethereum.      Genesis is designed to be the last significant update on the BSV blockchain; the implementation has been ""locked-in irrevocably,"" according to an on-chain message in the first post-fork transaction from the BSV developer team. An unchanging base protocol saves developers and companies from having to undergo frequent technical changes, the team says.    'Inadvertent' split    BitMEX Research tweeted there were still ""a significant number of nodes [that] have not upgraded for the hardfork and are stuck on the pre-hardfork block,"" an hour or so after the Genesis implementation.      Initially there appeared to be no signs of a chain split – where a blockchain splinters into multiple active versions – but BitMEX research reported just a few hours later the pre-Genesis chain had been ""extended by one block.""      A BSV spokesperson confirmed to CoinDesk the split had been caused by one miner – ""which in the scheme of things is very good"" – the Bitcoin Association was trying to contact.      Nguyen said this was not a ""persistent chain split"" but what appeared to be a miner ""who did not update their software to Genesis."" None of the mining pools so far contacted by the association had been responsible for the ""inadvertent block,"" he added.      ""A single block inadvertently mined on the wrong chain will not be extended - just the way Nakamoto consensus is supposed to work as described in the Bitcoin white paper. Nodes consider the longest chain as valid and extend that branch,"" Nguyen said.      BSV has been at the center of controversy since it forked from bitcoin cash in November 2018. One of its main proponents, Craig Wright, has claimed to be bitcoin's inventor Satoshi Nakamoto since 2016; many industry figures have disagreed with his claims, however.      Further, the cryptocurrency's proponents commonly hold the belief that BSV is the true bitcoin.      ""Bitcoin can finally be Bitcoin again and the miners can continue to write the Chronicle of everything,"" stated the on-chain post-fork message.      Emotions still run high on this issue. For instance, after announcing Monday that Twitter added a bitcoin emoji to its platform, billionaire and BSV advocate Calvin Ayre tweeted founder Jack Dorsey he is backing the ""wrong side.""      ""BTC is not Bitcoin and with the lawsuits that I know are coming related to this issue, this year.

42403953,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdh4oF,1580814235,Pullback Ahead? Bitcoin Price Indicators Suggest Waning Bull Momentum,"View  Bitcoin produced a ""doji"" candle on Monday, indicating bull fatigue and shifting risk in favor of a stronger price pullback. On the downside, major support is seen at $8,867 (200-day average).  If the 200-day average support holds ground, a fresh move higher toward $9,600 could be seen.  The overall trend will remain bullish as long as prices are holding above $8,200.    Bitcoin’s price action of the last 24 hours is telling a tale of buyer exhaustion and hinting at a more major price pullback ahead.      The top cryptocurrency by market value jumped to three-month highs above $9,600 during Monday’s Asian trading hours, extending January's 30 percent gain.      However, the breakout above the lateral resistance of $9,586 (Nov. 4 high) was short-lived and the cryptocurrency ended the day (UTC) on a flat note at $9,288.      Put simply, the day began with optimism but ended on a pessimistic note, with buyers failing to establish a strong foothold above price resistance. This type of price action at multi-month highs and after significant rallies is indicative of bull fatigue and often precedes a reversal.      Bitcoin is feeling the pull of gravity at press time. The cryptocurrency is currently trading below the former resistance-turned-support of $9,188 (Jan. 19 high). The global average price, as calculated by CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index, is seen at $9,170 – down 1.5 percent on a 24-hour basis.    Daily chart    Bitcoin created a classic doji candle with a long upper shadow on Monday, marking a bull failure at $9,586 (Nov. 4 high) and aborting the immediate bullish view.      The five-day moving average has topped out and is beginning to trend south, indicating a temporary bearish shift in momentum.      The MACD histogram is producing smaller bars above the zero line – also a sign of ebbing of bullish momentum.    4-hour chart    Monday’s rejection above $9,200 reinforced the lower highs, or bearish divergence, of the RSI.      Additionally, the RSI has now dipped into bearish territory below 50 and the negative bars on the MACD histogram are indicating a downside move is about to gather steam.      Bitcoin risks falling to the 200-day average, currently located at $8,867. A UTC close lower could cause more sellers to join the market, leading to a deeper slide toward $8,500.      The overall trend, however, will remain bullish as long as prices stay above $8,000.      The case for a pullback to the 200-day MA would weaken if the four-hour chart RSI crosses the descending trendline, in which case the cryptocurrency could have another go at $9,600.

However, data availability is set to decline over the same period due to blockchain technology replacing traditional business processes. By initiating smart contracts and eliminating all access to data otherwise available from third-party intermediaries it would remove those third parties from the transaction.      “This variable could leave participants in a worse position than if they did not participate in the blockchain smart contract process. As such, an organization’s overall data asset availability would decrease by 30 percent by 2023,” added Jones.      Gartner’s recent report, “Predicts 2020: Data and Analytics Strategies — Invest, Influence and Impact” (paywalled), also said smart contract technology remains very much in its infancy, with globalized organizations slow to adopt it.      The net impact, however, is a positive result for data and analytics return on investment (ROI), the report noted.      Smart contracts are programs or protocols operating on a blockchain that facilitate, verify or execute business processes triggered by events as well as on-chain transactions or interactions with other smart contracts.
