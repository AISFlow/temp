42397139,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYtFB,1366915295,"Average bitcoiner is young, male and nerdy","Who's your average bitcoin user? Chances are he's young, male, geeky and smart.  That's according to demographic research from Quantcast, which measures the habits of digital media audiences online.  Quantcast tracks 100 million websites around the world that have been tagged by their owners. It tracks behavior over time using cookies, and infers demographic information from traffic sources based on the websites visited.  In research released last week, Quantcast examined the behavior of people who had spent bitcoins on websites. It turned out that a whopping 88 percent of those found collecting bitcoins were male, and 57 percent of them were under 34. Only 3 percent were age 65 or over.  A word cloud developed by the firm analyzed search terms among bitcoin users. Not surprisingly, it showed they had a lot of interest in technology-related terms: ""Raspberry Pi"" and ""open source"" enjoyed the highest rankings. Other popular terms included ""exchange rate,"" ""making money"" and ""graphics card"" ... along with ""Ron Paul,"" ""Rand Paul,"" ""3d printer,"" ""Google Glass,"" ""Sim City"" and ""Crysis 3.""  Online bitcoin users also tend to hail from universities, especially those heavily focused on engineering, such as the Rochester Institute of Technology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of California - Berkeley, Imperial College London and Canada's University of Waterloo.  Of all the websites Quantcast tracks, though, there's at least one it doesn’t. That's Silk Road, the site that many bitcoin users go to for illicit, anonymous purchases.  ""You need to use a Tor browser to access Silk Road,"" said company spokesperson Patrick Hornung, ""and so I don't think that we're about to track that."" (A Tor browser is an anonymizing browser to shield the identity of a website’s visitor.)",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/04/25/average-bitcoiner-is-young-male-and-nerdy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5259412e922e415e5bed313f6839e2e1d63184db-960x960.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397134,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYtAG,1366906124,Could bitcoin ATMs take currency mainstream?,"If a Canadian entrepreneur has his way, we could soon see the bitcoin equivalent of a cash machine gracing our shopping malls.  Jeff Berwick plans to install a bitcoin ATM in San Diego early next month. The machine will be similar to a regular ATM, but instead of simply dispensing money from a bank account, it will serve as a point of exchange between bitcoins and US dollars or Euros.  Users will be able to insert either of the two physical currencies in any denomination, and enter a bitcoin address by scanning a QR code, Berwick says. The ATM will then deliver the bitcoins to their account. Alternatively, they can pay the machine from their bitcoin address, and retrieve US or European currency.  The first machine will be installed at an unspecified location in San Diego on May 2, Berwick promised.  But why?  ""There are people that are interested in bitcoins, but it's hard to buy them,"" Berwick told CoinDesk. ""For those that have bitcoins, they would love the opportunity to take dollars from their accounts and use them on a day-to-day basis.""  He sees this as a far better option than the conventional banking and international money transfer system.  ""It takes weeks normally to open a bank account,"" Berwick said. ""It takes you $100 to transfer money around the world. But you can transfer bitcoins in seconds, and it's a free transaction.""  Currently living in Mexico, Edmonton-born Berwick has the type of cred that's respected in the bitcoin world. In 1992, he founded Stockhouse, a financial news service based in Canada, and served as the company's CEO. Nowadays, he runs the libertarian website The Dollar Vigilante, and has no love lost for the central banking system.  A self-proclaimed anarchist, Berwick describes bitcoin as a way out of the ""dying fiat currency system.""  ""I think that what has happened in Cyprus is going to happen in the US,"" he said. ""The central banks are going to destroy their own currency. The US is so indebted that there's no way out for it other than to print (more of) its own currency.""  Berwick plans on installing an ATM in Cyprus sometime after the San Diego roll out, although the timeline has yet to be decided. For now, he is processing over 200 order queries for his ATM machines.  The units, made by popular ATM and kiosk manufacturer Genmega, cost $10,000 each.  ""We won't be looking to make a major profit on the machines; that will come from the transactions,"" he said.  Berwick plans to take between 3 and 5 percent on each transaction running through the ATMs. Each machine will be able to hold $100,000 in currency.  Bitcoins accessed via the ATMs will be delivered from a hot wallet, and the company will also hold a bitcoin reserve in an offline cold wallet. Within the next quarter, Berwick plans to start his own bitcoin exchange, to reduce his reliance on other exchanges when processing his currency.  ""The software will be proprietary -- we are not going to do anything off the shelf,"" he said. ""Our biggest issues there are just the regulatory ones. That's the biggest thing holding us back. We already have a lot of the programming in place.""",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/04/25/could-bitcoin-atms-take-currency-mainstream,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5259412e922e415e5bed313f6839e2e1d63184db-960x960.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397138,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYtDD,1366903758,"45% of bitcoin exchanges fail, study finds","Investing in bitcoins can be risky. So it's probably not surprising that starting a bitcoin currency exchange is risky too.  Online bitcoin exchanges have a failure rate of 45 percent, with customer balances often wiped out, a new study has found.  ""Bitcoin is expressly designed to be completely decentralized with no single points of control,"" says Tyler Moore, one of two US computer scientists who worked on the research study. ""Yet currency exchanges have become de facto central authorities, and their success or failure drives bitcoin's success or failure.""  Moore and Nicolas Christin looked at 40 bitcoin exchanges, examining the risk bitcoin holders face from exchange failures. (Click here to view a video of Moore discussing the research.)  Eighteen of the exchanges studied have gone out of business. Nine experienced security breaches from hackers or other criminal activity, forcing five of them to subsequently close. Another 13 closed without any publicly announced breach.  Of the 18 exchanges that closed, there were 11 where the authors found evidence of the customers having been reimbursed. Five exchanges have not reimbursed customers while six claim to have done so.  ""The risk of losing funds stored at exchanges is real but uncertain,"" the study states. ""Fraudsters are sometimes to blame, but not always.""  The median lifetime of exchanges is just 381 days, Moore and Christin found. They also discovered that currency exchanges that buy and sell higher volumes of bitcoins are less likely to shut down, but more likely to suffer a security breach.  ""(T)he continued operation of an exchange depends on running a high transaction volume, which makes the exchange a more valuable target to thieves,"" Moore and Christin write in their study.  The most popular bitcoin exchange, Mt, Gox, has been breached multiple times.  Moore and Christin's study, ""Beware the Middleman: Empirical Analysis of Bitcoin-Exchange Risk,"" was accepted as a paper to be featured at the 17th International Financial Cryptography and Data Security Conference held in Okinawa, Japan, earlier this month.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Doug Watt,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/04/25/45-of-bitcoin-exchanges-fail-study-finds,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5259412e922e415e5bed313f6839e2e1d63184db-960x960.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
