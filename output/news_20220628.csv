Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin slogs toward $20K; ether and other cryptos slide.  Insights: The performance of blue chip ICOs over five years may resonate with investors concerned about the current bear market.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $20,281 -2.5%  Ether (ETH): $1,143 -4.9%  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Terra LUNA +17.8% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Shiba Inu SHIB −9.7% Currency Dogecoin DOGE −9.6% Currency Decentraland MANA −8.9% Entertainment  Bitcoin Slogs Toward $20K  So much for the good times.  Bitcoin dipped for a third consecutive day to fall perilously close to the $20,000 threshold it had eclipsed last week and that has become a psychological barrier for investors who see the current bear market worsening.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading under $20,300, down about 2.5% over the past 24 hours as investors eyed the latest influx of discouraging economic data. On Monday, the U.S. Consensus Bureau's durable-goods report showed orders in May rising higher than estimated, fresh evidence that the economy was not cooling enough for the Federal Reserve to moderate its current monetary hawkishness.  Tuesday, the Conference Board found consumer confidence in the economy lagging to its lowest level in almost decade, a sign of the anxiety spurred by rising inflation, geopolitical unrest and recession fears. The report dovetails with the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index falling to an all-time low last week.  ""These are extremely anxious times in the markets so the celebrations didn't last very long,"" Oanda senior market analyst Craig Erlam wrote in an email, alluding to recent gains.  Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was changing hands below $1,200, off almost 5% over the same period. Most other major cryptos were in the red with SHIB and DOGE plunging nearly 8% and 7% respectively at one point. The popular meme coins had led in market returns for the past seven days.  Stocks  Crypto's downturn tracked stock markets, which fell for a second consecutive day as last week's surges faded increasingly into the background. The tech-focused Nasdaq dropped nearly 3% while the S&P 500 fell 2% and continues to linger in bear market territory, meaning that it has dropped at least 20% from its previous high.  Investors on Wednesday will be listening for statements about the global economy from central banking heads who have been meeting at a forum in Portugal. Later in the week, they will look for declines in May’s Personal Consumption Expenditure (month-over-month) and the June Purchasing Managers Index for manufacturing, a widely watched measure of monthly economic activity published by the nonprofit Institute for Supply Management (ISM).  High drama  Crypto markets saw a return of the type of high-drama events that have unsettled markets over the past two months. The CEO of the futures crypto exchange CoinFLEX accused the Bitcoin Cash supporter and noted investor Roger Ver of owing it $47 million in the stablecoin USDC. Ver had tweeted earlier Tuesday that ""some rumors have been spreading"" that he had defaulted on a debt to a counterparty; instead, he said, the counterparty ""owes me a substantial sum of money.""  And after a report emerged that the crypto exchange Huobi Global might cut over 30% of its workforce, an official at the rival exchange OKX announced plans for the company to increase its headcount by 30%.  Oanda's Erlam was pessimistic about crypto markets' path in upcoming days ""given the stream of negative headlines over the last couple of months.""  ""I fear more may follow in the weeks ahead and I wonder whether the community does too, given its inability to get any traction above $20,000,"" he wrote.  Markets  S&P 500: 3,821 -2%  DJIA: 30,946 -1.5%  Nasdaq: 11,181 -2.9%  Gold: $1,819 -0.2%  Insights  If You'd Held Certain Blue Chip ICO Tokens, You Would Have Earned Big  Initial coin offerings (ICO) pushed bitcoin to nearly $20,000 in 2017. But, as students of history know, many of these projects were unsustainable – where the vision didn’t match the team’s ability to execute – or outright scams. EY, which tracked the many of the projects that emerged from the ICO bubble, reported in 2018 that its ICO portfolio was down by 66%.  “EY found that only 29% (25) of the 2017 ICO projects that EY assessed have progressed to prototypes or working products – an increase of just 13% from December 2017. The remaining 71% have no offering in the market,” the professional services firm wrote at the time.  Looking back at this sector five years later, was it really an epic loss for all involved? Or were there some triumphant wins too? The performance of ICOs resonates loudly today as crypto experiences its latest severe bear market.  To be sure, the ICO sector was rife with fraud: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dished out plenty of charges during this period, charging many teams with offering unregistered securities or cases of outright fraud.  But it’s also a period where some of the most important blockchain infrastructure was developed.  Cardano, Tron, ChainLink, Filecoin, Crypto.com, Bancor. These are all names that emerged from the ICO bubble and went on to build big, important projects.  Using data from ICODrops, CoinDesk put together two portfolios of ICOs: a ""blue chip"" selection of the 100 most big recognizable names and a broad selection of 200 ICOs.  CoinDesk found that if you were to buy, and HODL, a broad selection of blue chip ICOs (data was measured in late May 2022) you would have done spectacularly well to the tune of a return of 819%. This would have blown away most other investments one could have made, including buying Nvidia’s stock, one of the best-returning stocks of the last decade, in late 2016 or the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector Index (NDXT).  Why is this exactly? Because these projects required time to thrive.  Sure, if you had a portfolio without these projects it would have a pittance return. And if you had a broad portfolio that had everything your return would have a lot less – but still something on par with the S&P 500.  Measuring their success during the heart of 2018’s crypto winter would produce lukewarm results at best: Crypto was an asset class with a $150 billion market cap in late 2018. Now, even with all the challenges presented in the last quarter, crypto is a $940 billion asset, and many of these projects that were born in this bubble are now major industry stakeholders. What a great investment for the HODLers.

42393822,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpBbRf,1656450085,Crypto Jobs: Who’s Cutting and Hiring?,"The crypto community has not had a unified response in dealing with the current bearish cycle, characterized by Terra’s collapse a month ago, the loss of critical price support levels among most cryptocurrencies and the fallout from the Celsius Network’s potential bankruptcy and Three Arrows Capital's insolvency.  Some crypto firms were caught off guard by the increased risk arising from the carnage in the ecosystem, while other companies have been preparing for this moment to build.  One metric that illustrates how prepared crypto firms were to weather the turbulence is the number of job layoffs and openings.  Who’s cutting crypto jobs?  On one side, a group of crypto firms has significantly downsized its workforce. After freezing its hiring process and rescinding job offers, Coinbase laid off 1,100 employees. Crypto.com let go of 260 people, Gemini cut its workforce by roughly 100 people and BlockFi reduced the number of its employees by 170 individuals. Moreover, Bitso, Buenbit and Mercado Bitcoin – major cryptocurrency exchange platforms based outside the U.S. – each laid off 80 people from their respective companies.  Read More: Young Web3 Believers Unfazed by Battered Crypto Market  The mass layoffs not only demonstrate how some giants in the crypto space are not bulletproof and susceptible to large market changes, but also practiced irresponsible behavior in terms of not having enough funds on the runway to keep promises to their staffs during the bear market.  Massive layoffs are not unique to the crypto space though. Netflix, Compass and Tesla are just three examples of noncrypto companies conducting massive layoffs.  According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate in the U.S. sits at 3.6% as of May 2022, and yet the number of large companies downsizing highlights the growing rumors concerning an incoming recession. On June 14, Coinbase’s CEO Brian Armstrong said in a note shared with all Coinbase employees, “We appear to be entering a recession after a 10+ year economic boom. A recession could lead to another crypto winter, and could last for an extended period.”  Who’s hiring?  Despite mass layoffs by major players, there are companies that are hiring and even accelerating their hiring process.

42422996,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1zkZh,1656450026,"Governments May Restrict Foreign Access to Their CBDCs, Riksbank Official Says","Central bank digital currencies (CBDC) won’t be a “silver bullet” that solves all issues with cross-border payments, according to Cecilia Skingsley, first deputy governor of Sveriges Riksbank, Sweden's central bank.  For instance, countries won’t necessarily “play nicely” with each other, making interoperability – or the way CBDCs interact with other payment systems – complex and layered, Skingsley said at the European Central Bank’s (ECB) annual forum on central banking held in Sintra, Portugal, on Tuesday.  “We have to think about different levels of interoperability,” Skingsley said, adding, “It's going to be jolly hard for everybody who wants to be part of that to agree on governance and supervision and the like.”  Skingsley was joined on a panel by ECB Executive Board member Fabio Panetta; Ulrich Bindseil, ECB director general of Market Infrastructure and Payments; Princeton economist Markus Brunnermeier; and Neha Narula, a director of the Digital Currency Initiative at the MIT Media Lab.  Last year, payments giant Visa announced it was working on a platform that would enable interoperability between CBDCs and other private digital currencies such as stablecoins, which are pegged to the value of another asset such as the U.S. dollar or gold.  Skingsley, who recently became the head of the innovation arm at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), an association of central banks from around the world, said BIS is set to release a report on CBDC interoperability in two weeks. The BIS Innovation Hub is conducting several CBDC experiments with central banks around the world.  In September 2021, BIS told central banks around the world they should start working on CBDCs because central bank money must evolve to fit into a digital future. At that time China had already made some progress on a digital version of the renminbi, its sovereign currency.  Now, countries around the world are looking into establishing a CBDC – which, panelists were told by Panetta, is at least in part in response to the crypto market boom when the market hit $2.7 trillion in October.  There are high expectations for CBDCs, from potentially streamlining cross-border payments to improving financial inclusion. According to the panelists, CBDCs will introduce competition to a digital payments world increasingly dominated by private banks.  But serious experimentation into CBDCs has only just begun and there are a host of implications and design elements to consider.  One thing that could complicate interoperability between different nations’ CBDCs is the level of access governments will be willing to provide to their CBDC, including how much individuals would be allowed to hold or even whether tourists should be able to use them to make payments, according to Skingsley.  It would be a more efficient and open system if, say, foreign payment service providers had access to CBDCs around the world, she said. But some countries could find that to be “too risky.”  “I think there will also be different choices and different levels of [barriers] that countries would like to choose,” Skingsley said. “So there won't be one access model [that would] work for everybody.”  Skingsley’s own country, Sweden, is looking into creating a CBDC, the e-krona in a bid to safeguard the central bank’s authority over private banks at a time when the country is going cashless at a dramatic pace. Sweden has one of the lowest rates of cash usage in the world, with only 10% of the population paying with cash in 2020, down from 40% in 2010.  In April, Riksbank started enquiring about possible suppliers and technical options that can form the basis for an e-krona. Around the same time, Riksbank found that tests to integrate state-backed digital money into conventional banking systems were a success and it would continue examining the benefits the new technology could bring.  At the ECB forum, Skingsley said the Sveriges Riksbank have estimated that demand for e-krona could be worth around 10% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP). For comparison, in 2019, cash in circulation in Sweden was at 1% of GDP.  “Providing as open infrastructures as possible could possibly help promote competition in the payment markets, not only domestically, but also across borders and put a bit of pressure on private solutions,” Skingsley said.

42394066,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bucikR,1656450015,‘We Want to Make Things Differently’: Laura Shin on Crypto and the Future of Work,"Even before the recent rise of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), Laura Shin was presenting TED talks claiming that crypto could allow more people to be their own boss.  Crypto allows for skin in the game, Shin argued – as these open and permissible networks lead to all types of experimentation across industries. She was speaking from experience.  Shin quit her job in mainstream media and has been an independent crypto writer and podcaster since 2015. She’s published a bestselling book, “The Cryptopians,” telling the early story of the idealistic, ambitious and frequently combative people who built the Ethereum network. And her weekly podcast, “Unchained Podcast,” has featured interviews with some of crypto’s most influential figures.  “When I started learning about crypto, I started realizing that, 'Oh, I think actually crypto will enable more people to work for themselves,'"" Shin told CoinDesk.  See also: What It Takes to Get a Job in Crypto  She still links to the TED talk on her LinkedIn and says her beliefs have grown only stronger. Shin said crypto will reduce people's dependence on single employers and allow them to do more meaningful work for themselves.  ""[Crypto] will enable a lot more teams to work together in groups [even if] they don't necessarily know each other,” she said. “They're just doing it all online as a community. They engage in financial transactions together.”  As a longtime observer in crypto, she shared what it takes for people to ""make it"" in crypto. As for advice? There's no set path.  ""The whole point of crypto is that we want to make things differently from how they've been before,"" Shin said.  The following excerpts were taken from an interview with Shin for Future of Work Week.  What was something that surprised you about Ethereum you learned while writing your book?  Workwise, I could say how truly distributed the team was. There was a lot of work that was done in Berlin. One of the main team members was in Amsterdam, and his team was in Brazil and Romania or Hungary or somewhere. There were other people kind of involved in Canada, Vitalik [Buterin, the Canadian programmer] was spending a lot of time in Asia during those years. A lot of the research was done in Singapore. So workwise, it was definitely a very decentralized and distributed organization geographically.  After covering crypto since the spring of 2015, what can you say about the types of people that ""make it"" in crypto?  I would say probably people who are very creative and imaginative and who see the potential in things that aren't fully developed. You probably are aware of a lot of these crypto skeptics that focus on how crypto is deficient in these different ways right now. The people who get into crypto and succeed can look at something that is not fully developed – even with all of its flaws – and see that someday, this could turn into something.  See also: Laura Shin on 'The Cryptopians' and What She Discovered  A lot of traditional finance people are always asking how it is that you can even value these assets. I think Chris Burniske got into crypto roughly around the same time as I did. He's done a lot of work on figuring out how you value these crypto networks. If you look at somebody like Meltem Demirors on Twitter, her background previously was in oil and gas, you’ll see how she takes her experience and knowledge from running businesses to talk about crypto projects – what they’re probably thinking about or what they should be doing better.  Everybody's coming from a different place, unless there are people who are in their 20s and their work history is mainly in crypto. But a lot of other people who are older take their learnings from other industries and apply that to crypto. And if they're creative enough to do it, then they can definitely come up with new things. Lots of really smart people in this space.  So what do you think the future of work will be like in crypto?  Before crypto, I just freelanced for most of my career. I prefer to work for myself. When I started learning about crypto, I started realizing that, Oh, I think actually crypto will enable more people to work for themselves.  I feel like with crypto we're gonna probably just have a lot more financial transactions in our lives. Similar to how we went from snail mail, a corded phone, to one I carry with me all day with multiple apps where people can communicate with me. I think the same thing is gonna happen to financial transactions in the future. People will just have many more ways of transacting financially with people all over the world.  See also: From an Attention Economy to a Values-Driven Economy | Opinion  That will enable people to have more streams of income, and that they may not rely on employment from a specific employer. They'll kind of be like freelancers. I did an interview with Chase Chapman on my podcast. She's very young. She just graduated from college. But she already is like, oh, yeah, “I consider myself a Web3 freelancer.” She works for all these DAOs.  You made a TED speech talking about how crypto could allow more people to be their own boss in 2018. Are there any changes or new observations you have had on this topic in the recent years?  I think DAOs are definitely more established than they were at that time. Just the fact that now there are so many kinds of DAOs. It's such a huge variety. I feel like it's not even as much of a thing now as it will be in the future. That's my opinion. Or even the fact that like a lot of these DAOs now have tools for doing HR or payroll to figure out how much people should be paid. A lot of new software tools for DAOs didn't exist back in the day.  In your opinion, how crypto itself could fundamentally change how we work?  I feel like it will reduce people's dependence on single employers, so they can do more work for themselves. And I think it will enable a lot more teams to work together in groups like they don't necessarily know each other. They're just doing it all online. It's more like a community. They engage in financial transactions together.  Do you think there will be some new work positions that will emerge in the future?  People have talked about how having “community managers” is so important for DAOs. You just need somebody to keep everybody informed and engaged. DAOs are kind of about community management in a lot of ways.  Even careers like law – I'm noticing that crypto lawyers now specialize in regulation or in IP (intellectual property) stuff around NFTs (non-fungible tokens) or securities law. So you don't have to be a tech person. You can be in a separate industry, but bring it to crypto.  What advice would you give to someone trying to make it in crypto?  I would say that they should remember that everybody who's working in crypto now is just making it up. I don't want to say there's literally no rules because obviously, crypto is old enough that certainly there are certain rules. But there's no set way to do all these things. So if you have an idea, and it's something new, you should pursue that. If you think that it might work, check it out. Don't think that everything's all decided and that this has been all figured out. Be creative.  We have all these different technologies people are experimenting with, if you can come up with a way to combine them in an interesting way. In my case, I'm a journalist, I have this skill set of how to do research or how to learn something very fast and then communicate it to other people in a clear way.  A lot of people may be really good with, like marketing or business development. If you can combine skills with crypto like that, that's also a good thing.  But generally, I think the whole point of crypto is that we want to make things differently from how they've been before.

The company has about 30,000 miners deployed in Montana, representing over 75% of the company’s active fleet.  The miners are likely to remain offline until the damaged power generating facility can be repaired, the company said in a statement on Tuesday.  However, some of the mining rigs might be able to come online and run at a reduced capacity as early as the first week of July, the company said.  “Bringing miners fully back online will take time, and we are committed to doing everything we can to rebuild our hashrate and to improve our bitcoin production,” said CEO Fred Thiel in a statement. “As part of that process, we have redirected our active miners, which represent approximately 0.6 exahash, to point towards a third-party mining pool, so that we can improve our probability of earning bitcoin while we work to bring the Hardin miners back online,” he added.  On June 9, the miner said that it experienced energization delays in Texas in May and ongoing maintenance issues at its facility in Hardin, leading to the production of about 47% fewer bitcoins (BTC) than initially expected.  Marathon said in April that it was already preparing to move miners from the Montana facility to more sustainable sources of power during the third quarter of this year.

Bitcoin (BTC) fell for a third straight day, drifting back down toward $20,000 and trading in sync with U.S. stocks.  There was no shortage of drama in the news as the crypto industry continued to address the fallout from the recent carnage in digital-asset markets. The price of BTC is now trading at less than a third of its all-time high around $69,000 late last year.  The CEO of the futures crypto exchange CoinFLEX accused the Bitcoin Cash supporter and noted investor Roger Ver of owing it $47 million in the stablecoin USDC. Ver had tweeted earlier Tuesday that ""some rumors have been spreading"" that he had defaulted on a debt to a counterparty; instead, he said, the counterparty ""owes me a substantial sum of money.""  And after a report emerged that the crypto exchange Huobi Global might cut over 30% of its workforce, an official at the rival exchange OKX announced plans for the company to increase its headcount by 30%.  ""Over the past two weeks, we have seen the bear markets bringing out the worst,"" Walter Teng, digital asset strategy associate at the independent investment research firm FundStrat, wrote in a newsletter.  LINK rally fizzles  Arcane Research, the Norwegian analysis firm, totted up a list of dismal indicators and predictions in a weekly report:  Prices for bitcoin mining machines ""have fallen off a cliff"" and are likely to keep falling, which means the miners may eventually have to ""dump their orders"" in the face of falling cash flows.  Bitcoin spot-trading volumes have fallen by 59% over the past nine days.  The growing industry woes are ""leading to a vicious withdrawal cycle on other centralized lending platforms.""  In digital-asset markets beyond bitcoin, the blockchain oracle project Chainlink's LINK rallied as much as 8% earlier after the Robinhood (HOOD) trading platform agreed to list the token. However, later in the day the rally fizzled and LINK was down 2.1%.  In traditional markets, a sell-off in tech led U.S. stocks lower as a key index of consumer confidence dropped to a 16-month low on growing worries over high inflation.

New York Community Bank to Hold Assets Backing Circle's USDC  By Krisztian Sandor  New York Community Bank, a New York State-based community bank that also has branches in New Jersey, Florida and Ohio, will serve as a custodian for some of the reserve assets behind the USD coin (USDC) stablecoin, Circle, USDC's issuer, said Tuesday.  USDC has distinguished itself from stablecoin competitors by forging closer ties with traditional banks and reportedly being more conservative in the selection of reserves, holding only U.S. dollar-denominated cash and short-term U.S. government bonds. It's the second-largest stablecoin after Tether's USDT, with a circulating supply of $55 billion. USDC has taken market share from USDT since the implosion of the Terra blockchain.  Earlier this spring, Circle announced that BNY Mellon (BK), one of the oldest and largest custodian banks in the U.S., would be the primary custodian for USDC reserves.  NYCB is a relatively small bank, managing $61 billion in assets, according to its website. By comparison, BNY Mellon's assets under custody amounts to $45 trillion.  Read the full story here.

42422999,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1zkfh,1656448064,Investment Firm Cypherpunk Holdings Sells All of Its Bitcoin and Ether,"Canada-based investment firm Cypherpunk Holdings (HODL) has dumped all of its bitcoin and ether holdings to ride out the current market risks.  The company sold 205.8209 ether (ETH), the native token of Ethereum, for C$293,000 ($227,000) and 214.7203 bitcoin (BTC) for about C$6.09million ($4.7 million). It accrued a total of C$6.38million ($5 million) in proceeds from the sales, according to a Tuesday announcement.  The company said it has C$18.16 million ($14.1 million) of cash and stablecoins on hand, adding it also has about C$1.93 million ($1.5 million) allocated to structured products with 30 days redemption notice.  Cypherpunk President and CEO Jeff Gao said the decision to dump all of the firm’s bitcoin and ether holdings came on the heels of rising market volatility that has made holding asset tokens increasingly risky for investors.  Both bitcoin and ether have lost more than half their value in the past year, sliding to 52-week lows earlier this month. The company's shares have tumbled 50% this year on the Canadian stock exchange.  “We believe that the most prudent approach is to sit on the sidelines as we wait for the volatility and illiquidity contagion to come to its logical conclusion,” said Gao in the statement. “On the balance of probabilities, we see weaker price action opening the way to lower levels to come as reports of the number of chains imposing 'temporary' suspension on withdrawals increases,” he added.  Gao noted that Cypherpunk will maintain a “long-term bullish outlook” on cryptocurrencies and will look to capitalize on future investment opportunities in the space “as and when they present.”  Crypto winter  Cryptocurrency markets have been plunged into a particularly icy crypto winter as investors react to decades-high inflation by selling off riskier assets, leading markets to recoil.  For example, bitcoin mining companies including Riot Blockchain (RIOT) and Bitfarms (BITF) collectively sold off more than 100% of their entire output in May as the value of bitcoin fell 45%, an analysis by Arcane Research found.  As economic headwinds continue to present solvency issues for cryptocurrency lenders and spur large industry-wide layoffs, investors are likely to continue selling off their cryptocurrency assets and move their money in what they perceive to be safer, less volatile stores of value, until the market is on the upswing.  Cypherpunk Holdings Chief Investment Officer Moe Adham said until the market takes a turn the risks for cryptocurrency investors remain “significant.”  ""Crypto markets remain in a deep risk-off environment,” said Adham “There remains risk of further significant drawdowns in asset prices across the crypto sector,” he added.

As per the RARE candlestick arrangement in the daily chart, there appears to be more headroom for the token. Past Performance of SuperRare SuperRare token prices are within a flat range and choppy. However, the coin is currently firm, printing higher when writing. In the last 24 hours, RARE crypto is up 18 percent versus the USDT and aligns with the encouraging gains of June 23. SuperRare Technical Analysis From the SuperRare coin formation in the daily chart, buyers have the upper hand. Today&apos;s push places the coin above the middle BB, confirming the gains of June 23. The immediate-term support level lies at the middle BB and $0.16 on the lower end. Since prices are edging higher, traders may find entries on pullbacks, with immediate targets at $0.36. This preview is valid because RARE prices are within the June 23 high volume bull bar. Besides, buyers have rejected all bear attempts to force prices lower, a net positive for optimistic buyers. A surge above the conspicuous bull bar of June 23 will complete the double bottom formation, possibly anchoring bulls. What to Expect from RARE? Currently, the RARE technical analysis points to strength provided prices are above $0.16—June 23 lows—and $0.15—June 2022 lows. The latter is a critical support level.

However, there is another way to interpret the coin days and hence the LTH conviction; as Glassnode explains: Stronger hands will resist the temptation to sell and this collective action builds up an &apos;opportunity cost&apos;. Every day HODLers actively decide NOT to sell increases the cumulative unspent &apos;opportunity cost&apos; (called the HODL bank).

Lamb made his allegation public Tuesday on Twitter, shortly after Ver denied ""some rumors"" he was involved with the default.  Lamb's Twitter comments came after his company announced late Monday it will launch a Recovery Value USD (rvUSD) token after recently halting withdrawals stemming from an outstanding debt that a high-net-worth customer – presumably Ver – owes the exchange.  Lamb claimed that Ver owes CoinFLEX $47 million USDC, and that the company has a “written contract with him obligating him to personally guarantee any negative equity on his CoinFLEX account and top up margin regularly. He has been in default of this agreement and we have served a notice of default.”  Lamb stressed that “the debt is 100% related to his account,” and that CoinFLEX is seeking to resolve the matter.  Prior to Lamb’s comments, Ver tweeted:  “Recently some rumors have been spreading that I have defaulted on a debt to a counter-party. These rumors are false. Not only do I not have a debt to this counter-party, but this counter-party owes me a substantial sum of money, and I am currently seeking the return of my funds.”  Ver was a very early investor in Bitcoin and Bitcoin startups, and is now one of the biggest supporters of Bitcoin Cash.

Christopher Giancarlo has shown by stepping into the ranks of French knighthood in part for his support of cryptocurrencies.  Giancarlo, who once ran the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and wrote the book “CryptoDad: The Fight for the Future of Money,” has been appointed as a chevalier – French for “knight” – in the National Order of Merit, with the Monday ceremony noting his crypto background.  Read more: 5 Questions for ""Crypto Dad"" Chris Giancarlo  “This honor reflects the French authorities’ great respect for your understanding of financial markets and the potentials of crypto finance,” according to a letter sent to Giancarlo from the French ambassador to the U.S., Philippe Étienne, who presided over the ceremony at the diplomat’s Washington residence.  “As humbled as I am to have received the award, it was especially satisfying to do it in front of so many colleagues from my time in government and today, as well as my family and dear friends,” Giancarlo told CoinDesk.  Giancarlo, who’s now a lawyer at Willkie Farr & Gallagher and who also holds several board and advisory posts at crypto firms, stood before a crowd that included current CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam and several other U.S. regulatory officials as he was granted entry into the French order.  This knighthood was founded in the last century to honor people who distinguish themselves in the military or civilian world, and includes 182,000 members globally, according to the organization's website. Giancarlo, who is a U.S. citizen descended from a French immigrant, was also recognized for his involvement in the French American Academy, a bilingual elementary school program.  In remarks at the ceremony, Giancarlo recalled his tenure at the CFTC, praising the agency’s early support of cryptocurrencies.  “Our willingness to brave political risk in greenlighting bitcoin futures reduced regulatory risk for lawful trading and investment,” he said. “Though another ‘crypto winter’ may be setting in, there is no question in my mind that the future of financial assets is as digital tokens.”  France boosted its crypto reputation when it granted Binance its first European regulatory license last month to operate a trading platform and take custody of digital assets.

42421529,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoYXN,1656438582,From an Attention Economy to a Values-Driven Economy,"If a non-fungible token (NFT) community that is organized as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) has thousands of community members, each contributing and earning rewards, claiming bounties and building – are participants engaging in a new form of work? What if they share a common cause?  As counterintuitive as it sounds at the end of a NFT hype-cycle, the success of digital communities will hinge on affinity and values over attention and control. This is the type of value – and community-driven work Web3 excels at.  Tara Fung is co-founder of Co:Create and the CEO of Gesso Labs. This article is part of CoinDesk's Future of Work Week.  From attention markets to institutions  Yes, the current version of the web has fostered digital communities and other forms of social organization unconstrained by geographical limitation. Social media platforms, especially, have extended our capacity to connect with others who share our views, interests and goals via attention markets and matchmaking algorithms.  However, incumbent technology platforms – like Twitter and Facebook – have scaled us past Dunbar’s number in terms of coordination but not for cooperation. (This is to say nothing of how ""platform capitalists"" generate revenue from our attention and data, rather than letting it accrue to individuals or groups.)  The inventor of smart contracts, Nick Szabo, also had interesting ideas about social scalability: Institutions have to “overcome shortcomings in human minds ... that limit who or how many can successfully participate."" If DAOs could get social scalability right, it could be a significant step for the internet era.  Read More: What You Need to Know and Do to Get a Job in Crypto  Cryptocurrencies, NFTs and DAOs enable us to take a step further in social scalability. They allow digital communities to define themselves autonomously and become digital institutions with real and independent economic power.  Communities now have the ability to create their own money, their own rules of cooperation and their own forms of labor. By defining these components for themselves – quite literally in code – they are also defining their own values.  What’s changing?  Most online work and economic activity is still managed offline by brick-and-mortar institutions that have products to sell as well as social norms and laws to follow, all largely defined by their geographic location. Our online interactions are like an additional coordination layer for IRL economic operations of companies.  Moreover, online interactions between groups of people are still mediated by centralized companies and platforms. And so the online economy is more like a mirror – though increasingly an augmentation – of the physical-world economy because the web has only had read and write capabilities and the full range of economic interaction is limited.  This all changes when digital communities can leverage tools that go beyond the capability to receive, sort and relay external information to the new capabilities for distributed ownership, value creation and transfer brought by Web3. These technical changes are extremely important and introduce a whole new design space for the economics of work and cooperation.  These new types of institutions will form between stakeholders and live natively online.  From branding to affinity  There’s definitely room for speculation around what these new institutions could end up looking like and what will work for them. While the potential is great, the current status is a work in progress. Exploration and innovation are needed to increase social scalability beyond current breaking points.  When it comes to organizing online and the current Web3 culture, it is clear traditional corporate branding is not effective. In fact, it is often the cause of ridicule by organically engaged digital communities. Meme culture is favored instead, and more importantly, affinity with a project’s values and ideologies.  Read more: Market Downturn Hasn't Chilled Optimism About Crypto Jobs  In the future, talent and human capital will gather around the ideas, values and virtues of these new institutions rather than simply around products and companies. A shared mission is already the strongest common attractor for many Web3 communities, innovative blockchain protocols and NFT projects.  If we believe in the future of Web3 as builders, this gathering will take shape as the new platform for our social and professional lives where workforces organize around affinities and interests.  Take NFT projects as an example. The largest NFT communities have huge potential to harness an already engaged, diverse and passionate group of people to continue creating value and building economies around collections.  Will these NFT projects branch into other forms of creative output and become influential ecosystems or brands outside of crypto? Could an NFT group become a large ""employer"" in the future? It’s an open question.  This idea of affinity over branding is changing how work is done. Web3 communities and institutions now have the special opportunity to hard code what it will look like. Going forward, they could even benefit from a foundational Web3 layer that eases their development. Call it a community of communities.

The two companies will also work on ""low-cost financial solutions for underserved and unbanked communities,"" according to a statement.  The partnership is part of Circle's push to include underrepresented financial institutions in the digital asset market and allocate a share of its reserves in minority-owned depository institutions.  USDC has distinguished itself from stablecoin competitors by forging closer ties with traditional banks and reportedly being more conservative in the selection of reserves, holding only U.S. dollar-denominated cash and short-term U.S. government bonds. It's the second-largest stablecoin after Tether's USDT with a circulating supply of $55 billion. It has taken market share from USDT since the implosion of the Terra blockchain.  Earlier this spring, Circle announced that BNY Mellon, one of the oldest and largest custodian banks in the U.S., would be the primary custodian for USDC reserves.  NYCB is a relatively small bank, managing $61 billion in assets, according to its website. By comparison, BNY Mellon's assets under custody amounts to $45 trillion.  In the long term, though, Circle says it aims to move ""billions of dollars in deposits over time"" to underrepresented financial institutions.  “By partnering with NYCB, we are opening up new pathways for community banks and MDIs across the country to be key participants in the fast growing digital assets market,"" Dante Disparte, Circle's chief strategy officer and head of global policy, said in the statement, referring to minority depositary institutions.

42421524,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoYQ9,1656434609,"4 Tips for Supporting Distributed Offices, From a Web3 Founder","Workplace loneliness, already a pressing issue before the coronavirus pandemic, was exacerbated by the risks of COVID-19, the shift to remote work and the so-called Great Migration. Many of us are asking, how can we minimize loneliness in the future of work?  Web3 takes the best elements of Web 2.0 and adds in decentralized, autonomous and community-first hierarchies. Crypto is a mission-driven industry with a global and resourceful culture.  Rebecca Simmonds is a founding team member of Vega Protocol. This article is part of ""Future of Work Week.""  While these attributes can go a long way toward helping people feel connected and less lonely on the job, workplace loneliness will not eradicate itself.  Truly addressing loneliness – and related issues – requires strong, empathetic leadership. Whether a company or project has an office or a decentralized workforce, it needs to have a clearly communicated vision of what people are working toward. That builds community and a shared sense of purpose.  Read more: What Is a DAO?  This insight is not new, but has unique effects for an industry that prides itself on open protocols, flattened power-structures and open-source collaboration. The eternal challenge has been delivering this consistently and frequently messaging while evolving with changes in the project, product and people. In Web3, we might ask: Where does the mission originate – from the founder or the community?  Here are some hard-won truths I have learned about tackling workplace loneliness while building a Web3 project.  Leadership is even more important in Web3  Web3 values open communication, information-sharing and creativity, so it makes sense that these are also the values we try to live by in our projects. With this, however, comes a responsibility to help the team navigate new ways of working and interacting.  The practical limitations of remote-first work mean there are no “watercooler” moments or serendipitous chats over coffee. Instead we have Zoom, Slack, GitHub, Notion, etc. Ensuring everyone on the team is fully supported requires consistent group and individual communication from leaders to ensure people don’t get lost or left behind.  Read more: What Is Web 3 and Why Is Everyone Talking About It?  The administration overhead in getting a ‘mission driven’ team is worth the effort  At Vega, our mission is to build decentralized, trustless and permissionless financial products. I’ve found that the people attracted to work on this challenge are often mission-driven, open-minded and curious. They have a high tolerance for risk and clear ideas of what they believe is right or not.  Our team is distributed across multiple countries, cultures and continents, which brings great diversity of thought and perspective. Despite these differences, the connection to the mission means we share a lot of common ground already.  Hiring similarly self-motivated employees is a start, but we’ve also invested in administration and logistics. That helps in organizing time zones and navigating cultural differences and disparate employment laws.  Find the balance between remote work and in-person  Working remotely is the norm in Web3. Eliminating commute times and having flexible working hours, unlimited holidays and self-directed work-plans allows the team more control over their lives.  But nothing compensates for the shorthand you develop from knowing your colleagues in person. Web3 projects should make it as easy as possible to work together in person if desired, and at the very least host an annual all-project meetup.  Build a supportive and open culture  To feel connected, people need to know that when they share their thoughts, feelings and true selves, they will be met with openness and support.  Leaders need to be open, supportive and inquisitive. At Vega, we make an effort to acknowledge actions that demonstrate these values and address those that do not. We have the advantage of still being relatively small, which means that accessing the founders is as easy as connecting with anyone else.  Read More: US Job Growth Tops Expectations in May, With 390K Added  Due to the flexibility it offers, I imagine the future of work will move further toward the Web3 model, and this will require leaders to make conscious decisions to foster community and connection with teams. Loneliness is a complex emotion, and whether the work vehicle looks like a project, DAO, or more traditional company, the Web3 values of openness, community and autonomy make for a very strong foundation for continuing to tackle this issue.

42393970,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brwb9f,1656433585,What It Takes to Get a Job in Crypto,"Market conditions and prominent layoffs have undoubtedly changed the employment landscape in the crypto and blockchain industries. Yet, some crypto firms have seen this as an opportunity. Some like OKX are expanding their headcount this crypto winter while job boards are still rife with opportunities.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Future of Work Week series.  Although conditions have changed, the best advice on how to land a job in crypto has not. CoinDesk interviewed academics, marketing professionals, developers and founders to discover what it takes to bag a coveted job in the crypto space. Here is what we found.  Find the right project, company or organization for you  As crypto and blockchain have matured, so have the practices and philosophies behind managing employees. Reuben Youngblom, managing editor of MIT’s Cryptoeconomic Systems Blockchain Journal & Conference Series, said in an interview with CoinDesk “blockchain is now maturing to the point where the space runs the entire spectrum.”  “On the extreme end, you have some DAOs [decentralized autonomous organizations] that exist where people can go in and don't even need to give up their names to find work. On the other end, there are companies that are a lot more structured and will do a headcount every morning or give employees a time to start the workday,” he said.  Read More: The Crypto Jobs Boom  Individuals seeking a job in the crypto or blockchain industries need to consider what work environment is best for them and try to find a company or organization that fits. Crypto job seekers can use job board sites like Glassdoor to read reviews from current and former employees to gain insight.  Get involved for the right reasons  Working in the crypto and blockchain industries can be lucrative. According to job listings site web3.career, the average Web3 salary is $74,000 to $115,000 per year for nontech positions and $100,000 to $142,000 per year for developer positions. While making a potential six-figure salary is nice, chasing a large salary can lead to horrible outcomes for job searchers.  Youngblom has seen firsthand the consequences of chasing salary and prestige. “Those people have a really bad time, and they burn out really quickly, or they don't burn out and they're just miserable.”  A better approach is to think critically about why you are interested in crypto or blockchain and tailor your job search to find the projects, companies or organizations that meet your interests. Troy Retzer, who facilitates partnerships at decentralized finance (DeFi) startup Rook Labs, says that “whenever you find something with real innovation, it’s easy to become obsessed with it.”  Demonstrate your value to the crypto community  Josh Ong, co-founder of Bored Room Ventures, a consulting agency and non-fungible token (NFT) fund that partners with brands to develop Web3 strategies, gave some choice advice to job searchers.  “Contribute what you can and be open to learning and be curious and then kind of find ways to level up from there,"" he said. ""Some people start by contributing to [a project’s] Discord, and they're doing it not for pay. All it takes is one experience to be able to turn around and be ready to be professional about it and maybe get paid the next time.”  Read More: Payroll, Web3 and the $62B Opportunity  Retzer agrees. “Find a project you like, join the Discord, update their FAQ for them … they will see this person is actively contributing to help. You'll get on their radar right away.”  Be aware of the risks  Cryptocurrency and the industries that develop it are inherently volatile. Although some crypto companies are poised to weather these risks, there are unfortunately others that are not. “[H]aving ridden out the storm and 2018 to 2020, that was tough, you know. So I recognize that we may be in for some extended challenges,” said Ong, when asked about the current state of cryptocurrency.  Youngblom supports Ong’s assertion. “I mean, even companies that six months ago, people might have thought were immune, like Coinbase [COIN], they're experiencing massive layoffs. I don't think it's that controversial to say that crypto companies, or blockchain companies in general, are a little more exposed to the vicissitudes of the economy.”  Resources for job hunters  PompCryptoJobs – a dedicated job board for positions in the crypto industry.

42421535,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoYdZ,1656432777,SEC’s Gensler Reiterates Bitcoin Alone Is a Commodity. Is He Right?,"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler has reiterated his claim that bitcoin (BTC) is a commodity. His interpretation is partially rooted in precedent and, one would hope, reality.  ""Some, like bitcoin, and that's the only one, Jim, I'm going to say because I'm not going to talk about any one of these tokens [that] my predecessors and others have said [are] a commodity,"" Gensler said in an interview with CNBC’s Jim Cramer on Monday.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Where Gensler departs from his predecessors is his unwillingness to define Ethereum the same way. As chairman, Gensler has long noted that the vast majority of crypto coins are under his agency’s remit.  “Crypto financial assets have the key attributes of a security,” he said recently, noting that there’s almost always a centralized entity that directs projects and stands to profit the most. That was certainly the case when the Ethereum blockchain first burst onto the scene in 2014 with an initial coin offering, a motley crue of builders and investors and institutions such as the Ethereum Foundation.  See also: How Much ETH Does Joe Lubin Hold? | The Node  However, by 2018, then-SEC Director for the Division of Corporation Finance William Hinman said Ethereum ought to be classified as a commodity having reached “sufficient decentralization.” The open, publicly accessible network grew to include a diverse cast of stakeholders.  Gensler’s comments have injected some confusion into the markets, as is the case when any institution seems to backtrack on previously established guidance. But some bitcoiners view it as confirmation that bitcoin truly stands distinct from “crypto.”  OG bitcoiner Jameson Lopp, for instance, made the distinction recently saying most cryptos are “decentralized in name only,” or DINOs, and likely unregistered securities. MicroStrategy (MSTR) CEO Michael Saylor called for crypto’s “parade of horribles” to be stamped out by regulators.  In Saylor’s world, the government’s stamp of approval is a stepping-stone towards bitcoin being embraced as a “treasury reserve asset” for “politicians, agencies, governments and institutions” the world over. Because bitcoin is capped at 21 million coins, and cannot be debased as it acts as a buoy against the “melting ice cube” that is an inflating fiat economy.  In recent months, this Saylorism has been embraced by a growing number of bitcoiners. Critics, like developer Jacob Franek, point out the contradiction in believing that bitcoin’s value proposition is “granted” by the state.  But Franek isn’t quite right – it’s not a chicken and egg thing – the commodities classification stems from bitcoin’s actual material conditions of being highly decentralized.  Bitcoin is a distributed network powered by a digital asset – it has no single administrator or owner. Although people may buy BTC thinking they may profit from holding it – including profiting from the work of others who build useful apps or maintain its codebase – there’s no entity to which profits accrue, unlike with securities as defined by the SEC’s “Howey Test.”  See also: ​​Recent Crypto 'Bloodbath' Is Not Necessarily Bad, Regulators Say  In fact, part of bitcoin's strength is that it’s grown large enough that government classifications really do not matter. It’d be exceedingly difficult to take down the Bitcoin network, even for a nation-state. And if the SEC wanted to call it a security, who would it sue?  This doesn’t mean Saylor is correct in siccing securities watchdogs on crypto. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, and many assets could conceivably follow in its footsteps – hence SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce’s “Safe Harbor” proposal, which would give blockchain projects time and space to evolve beyond their founders.  Recent academic research from Baylor University noted that in its early years Bitcoin had a very limited number of stakeholders. It wasn’t always decentralized and at times early miners could have easily attacked the blockchain.  And though its founder Satoshi Nakamoto seemingly never profited from his work, his hashes stand in time, showing how most networks – at their beginning – are networks of a few.

42423031,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1zkbh,1656432000,A16z Leads $6M Seed Funding Round in Blockchain Linera,"Linera, a layer 1 blockchain project intended to bring Web2 scalability to Web3 has completed a $6 million seed funding round led by Marc Andreessen's Andreessen Horowitz (a16z).  Cygni Capital, Kima Ventures and Tribe Capital also participated in the round, Linera said in a statement on Tuesday.  Linera founder and CEO Mathieu Baudet has a PhD in cryptographic protocols and is a former Meta (FB) employee who helped create Facebook’s Libra blockchain.  The Linera chain aims to be low latency.  “If you interact with traditional exchanges, or you’re used to insanely fast interactions, we’d love to get closer to those kind of numbers,” Baudet told CoinDesk. “The actions are rewarded like near-real time very quickly by the standard centralized system.”  Another feature of Linera is linear scalability, a system from Web2 where additional processing units are added as needed. In the case of Linera, this consists of shards, or individual threads, of the chain adding additional validators for network efficiency.  Sharding is a technique that aims to fulfill the three tenets of a blockchain network: scalability, security and decentralization. It has been a significant component of the Ethereum merge, with the goal of scaling the network by segmenting it into smaller chains.  Baudet said Linera plans to use the funding to hire engineers and team members to build out the protocol. He did not disclose when the network will launch its open-source protocol.

DYOR: Do Your Own Research means that before investing in anything, including cryptocurrency, it's important to do your own research and not just rely on other people's advice or opinions.  FOMO: Fear of Missing Out is a common crypto refrain. Most often used in the context of worrying about missing out on an opportunity to make money, but can also be used generally for anxiety of missing out on being part of events or new projects.  FUD: Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt is used when people share negative information about cryptocurrencies online. The person sharing may be accused of spreading “FUD” or that people selling an asset are doing it out of FUD.  NGMI: Not Gonna Make It is used by the crypto community for projects that are going to fail, or if someone has made a bad decision as an investor while ignoring market data or advice, you’re “ngmi.”  WAGMI: We're All Gonna Make It is used as a rallying cry in the crypto community.

42394523,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwAVQH,1656429111,What Is an On-Chain Resume?,"If you want to work in crypto, you may need more than a traditional resume to land a gig. Many jobs will want you to show your background and skills with cryptocurrency, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and other digital assets, depending on the position. That's where an on-chain resume comes in.  Though there are similarities with a traditional resume, an on-chain resume provides your professional background in a different manner.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Future of Work series.  Traditional resume vs. on-chain resume  A traditional resume is a document that provides an overview of your professional background, such as your work history, education and special skills.  But if you want to get a job in crypto, an on-chain resume may be more important. The thing about crypto is that one’s activities are visible on the blockchains you participate in, and so if you are looking to work in the NFT sector, you can point to the NFTs you have minted on NFT marketplace OpenSea, your PFP (profile picture) on Twitter or the address of the land you’ve bought in a metaverse project like The Sandbox, for example.  An on-chain resume is a log of your historical activities stored in a blockchain network such as Ethereum (ETH) that highlights your experience, transactions and skills. It is considered Web3 content.  Your on-chain resume can be as simple as a wallet or wallets containing transactions to verify your activity on a blockchain. These activities demonstrate that you “do crypto” and your experience over time with different tokens and projects, which can be seen as more valuable than a traditional resume that lists your qualifications.  Read more: What You Need to Know and Do to Get a Job in Crypto  Creating your on-chain resume  Creating an on-chain resume should be tailored to the job you want to get. Your on-chain resume for a job as a developer in a decentralized finance (DeFi) staking platform would be very different than one that focuses on landing a job in a play-to-earn game developer.  Think of a niche in blockchain technology you want to pursue a job in. Make a list of potential blockchain activities that can support your credibility for that niche. For instance, if you choose to be a bitcoin (BTC) market analyst, you can focus on buying and selling bitcoin in your wallet.  Two things that most people should start with when building an on-chain resume include:  Make sure you carefully decide which wallet or wallets you will want to showcase to employers, because that will detail your skill set reflected by your transactions.  Because most transactions you will want to perform for an on-chain resume are conducted on Ethereum, you can designate a reader-friendly name to your wallet address by using an ENS (Ethereum Name Service). This is like reserving a domain name with a .com or .org so that people can access your website. If you decide to use a blockchain network other than Ethereum, such as Solana, you can use the wallet address as an access point to your on-chain resume.  There are plenty of options to build your on-chain resume, and transactions aren't only Ethereum-based. Here are some ideas to jump-start your journey toward building skills for specific crypto roles.  Crypto trader and investor  If you want to advise on crypto investing, trading on a decentralized exchange (DEX) is an excellent activity to do. You can swap solana (SOL) with binance coin (BNB), which aren't Ethereum-native assets.  Popular DEXs include SushiSwap, PancakeSwap and Uniswap. By trading on a DEX, you can show your active participation in DeFi.  NFT artist  You can create digital media such as images, music and other digital formats to be minted into an NFT. Likewise, you can also start a collection of NFTs in your wallet.  You can easily mint one of your pieces of work on OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace on the Ethereum network. Another good option is Solanart, another large NFT marketplace on the Solana network.  Software engineer  Having in-depth knowledge of a product or service is essential to being a developer in that industry. Staking or earning rewards for holding certain cryptocurrencies can help give you credibility as a blockchain software engineer. You can stake popular cryptocurrencies on platforms such as Binance, Crypto.com and Kraken.  Understanding the mathematical formulas for rewards and interest demonstrates your knowledge of staking.  Risk analyst  Cryptocurrencies are considered high-risk, high-reward assets. Putting your cryptocurrencies into a Maker vault shows potential employers your experience with exposure to risk. Users can deposit one type of cryptocurrency as collateral in a Maker vault to obtain a loan paid in dai. These transactions help demonstrate your DeFi banking experience.  Trade support manager  By lending cryptocurrencies on platforms such as Aave and Compound, you are providing proof of another form of trading for your on-chain resume. If you are curious, you can experiment with lending to earn interest.  These types of transactions also demonstrate familiarity with DeFi.  Additionally, you can make use of services that can assist you with creating an on-chain resume and save you some time, such as:  Zapper facilitates your DeFi positions with a single click eliminating the need to interact and navigate multiple DeFi platforms.  RabbitHole is a platform with quests that guide you through making transactions while getting rewards.  Degenscore provides a profile showing your activity level with DeFi smart contracts and protocols. This is also a way to check your progress as you build your on-chain resume.  Blockchain technology is always evolving, and exploring new activities to include in your on-chain resume shows that you are learning and growing as the crypto world continues to expand.  Read more: Learn-to-Earn, Move-to-Earn: How to Earn Crypto in New Ways  Final words of caution before starting your on-chain resume  Because an on-chain resume is public and immutable, it would be wise to separate your on-chain resume from your portfolio wallet. You wouldn’t want to lure cybercriminals and compromise the security of your hard-to-earn assets.  Finally, an on-chain resume shouldn't be seen as the only format to send when applying for jobs in the blockchain industry. In fact, it can (and probably should) be used in conjunction with a traditional resume, a LinkedIn profile and a portfolio to bolster your profile.

42394052,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69buck9d,1656428996,How I Made It: From Pro Baller to Master of DAOs,"For better or for worse, everyone will notice the same thing about Auryn Macmillan the first time they meet him: He’s very tall. So tall that it’s no surprise he spent years as a professional basketball player, thundering down courts from his Australian homeland to Germany and beyond.  These days, Macmillan is a key player in perhaps the single most exciting sector of blockchain development – decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). He was in the orbit of the original, ill-fated Ethereum DAO, and over the years has contributed to projects including First Blood, Gnosis, Ethercamp and Colony – some, you may note, more successful than others.  This article is part of CoinDesk's Future of Work Week.  Macmillan was also a cofounder of DAOhub, one of the first DAO-focused information aggregators, in 2016. (That project was handed over to a team now going by DaoBase and hosted at DAObase.org. It is not affiliated with Daohub.io.) Most recently, he’s the co-founder with Kei Kreutler of Gnosis Guild, a unit of Berlin-based startup Gnosis focused on building tools for DAOs. (Disclosure: I’ve been invited to join a planned DAO affiliated with Gnosis Guild’s tooling work.)  Macmillan’s path is in many ways characteristic of an earlier era of crypto, when passion and curiosity were much larger motivators than any short-term payday. But even with today’s higher stakes, increasing corporatization and increasingly prevalent bad actors, he stands behind his approach to career-building.  That approach was built on the same principles that make a great ballplayer: obsession, curiosity, creativity and flexibility.  Be a tinkerer  Though his basketball turn is eye-catching, an upbringing that revolved around doing things with his hands was much more key to Macmillan’s path. He grew up in Christmas Hills, a small village in Australia’s wine-producing Yarra Valley. His parents are both musicians, and his father ran a recording studio at home.  “He used to build his own equipment, and from exposure to that I learned a little bit about that [electronic hardware] side of things,” he said.  Read More: What You Need to Know and Do to Get a Job in Crypto  Also with his dad, Macmillan said he converted three diesel Mercedes-Benzes to run on used vegetable oil. They’d collect used oil from local restaurants to fuel the cars. Nearby wineries also got a share of his interest: In his teens, he washed dishes for a half dozen of them, and for a time considered a career as a chef.  But you can already guess what really enthralled his tinkerer’s brain.  “I’ve been pulling apart computers since I was 11 or 12,” Macmillan said. “We had maybe a 386 [Intel 386-based desktop], and since then I’ve been obsessed. I’ve always been a nerd at heart. I was a nerd before I played basketball.”  Stay focused  Despite that early clarity of vision, you might say biology had its own plans. At 16, Macmillan took up basketball, and things went in an unexpected direction.  “I got really good really quickly, mostly because I was tall and fairly athletic,” he says.  That’s a bit of trademark humility from Macmillan. For those not familiar with high-level sports, 16 is quite late in life to start playing basketball. Many U.S. basketball training programs suggest starting kids on fundamentals as young as 8 years old. All-time great Hakeem “The Dream” Olajuwon is often described as having started learning the game “late” at age 15.  It takes more than being “fairly athletic” to overcome such a belated start: It takes incredible dedication, even if you are 6 feet, 8 inches tall. (Macmillan is, for example, still at least two inches below the listed 6-foot-10-inch height of Larry Cermak, the Block’s director of research and another basketball-to-blockchain transfer student. Yet Cermak didn’t go on to a pro career. Interesting.) Thanks to his hard work, basketball swiftly became more than a game for Macmillan. It actually sidelined his longer-term passion for computing – something he now sees as a misstep.  “After graduating from high school, I did one year of computer science here [at Swinburne University] in Melbourne, then I dropped out to take a basketball scholarship in the U.S.,” at Gardner-Webb University outside Charlotte. “They didn’t have a computer science major, so I ended up majoring in psychology. I was focused on basketball, and I got into psych because it was easy. That was a bit of a mistake, in retrospect.”  Be curious  Though he never made it to the NBA, Macmillan would spend the next few years on an intense, global basketball circuit, often spending full seasons in the U.K. or Germany, then heading back to Australia in the summer to play offseason ball closer to home. Starting in 2010, he played for teams including the Australian national team; the Kilsyth Cobras and the Illawarra Hawks; Germany’s Langen Giraffes (“which was pretty funny”); and England’s Plymouth Raiders.  Then, in roughly 2013 or 2014, the big moment came. “I stumbled across Bitcoin. I fell down the rabbit hole through discovering the deep web,” said Macmillan, “discovering Tor browser, and discovering all these marketplaces denominated in bitcoin. So I had to figure out what the hell a bitcoin was.  “Then I relatively quickly stumbled across a bunch of early forum posts by Vitalik [Buterin] talking about the idea of Ethereum, and that’s what made blockchains click for me, particularly the idea of DAOs. So I followed Ethereum very closely after that, and participated in the crowdsale.”  Build stuff  Very quickly, McMillan’s career became much more about blockchains than basketball. Focused on DAOs from very early on, Macmillan said he realized there was a need to organize conversations on the topic and bring people together. To respond to that need, he and a cofounder launched DAOhub.  Read More: You’re Hiring Wrong: Do It More Like Web3  “That became a de facto hub for the DAO community,” he said. “We were front and center for the meteoric rise and catastrophic fall of the DAO. And we connected with and made really close connections with influential folks who were involved, like Griff [Green] and Lefteris [Karapetsas].”  It’s also where he first met Martin Koppelmann and Stefan George, co-founders of Gnosis. But it would be some time before he himself became a key figure at the startup. Around late 2016, he became community director for a would-be esports betting platform called First Blood. During the same period, he was freelancing for both Gnosis and something called Ethercamp.  “[Ethercamp] wound up being a really bizarre project and their founder just vanished,” Macmillan said. Having an occasional bit of bad luck is part of even the most impressive career paths.  Soon, he said, “I got a little frustrated doing community, not having a way to tangibly enact change on product.” So in 2018, he moved on to a role with DAO-centric project Colony as what they called “BDSM Lead.”  “It stood for business development success something … Actually we never figured out what BDSM stood for, we just wanted to say it,” he said.  Keep growing  After a couple of years at Colony, Macmillan also started contributing at Gnosis again.  “Colony was really supportive of that, there wasn’t a conflict of interest. Everyone was fine and aware of everything.” This was still in the depths of the 2019-2020 “crypto winter,” and might be the hardest part of Macmillan’s path to reproduce: It’s difficult to imagine many blockchain projects being okay with such multitasking today, given the intense demand for talent even after the recent downturn.  Read More: Payroll, Web3 and the $62B Opportunity  And indeed, that side gig did wind up leading Macmillan away from Colony. “There was a really interesting opportunity to take on more of a product role on [Gnosis’] conditional tokens framework.” As that project wound down, Macmillan has transitioned entirely to working on DAO tooling under Gnosis Guild.  He also made another shocking discovery. “We needed a contract written, and we didn’t have any other resources. I said heck, I’ll write it, and we’ll give it to the auditor. And it turned out it was good. I realized that after years of reading Solidity code I could also write it, I had just never tried.” With that powerful arrow in his quiver, Macmillan said he has “this weird, little bit of everything role now.”  The winding path is the best path  One might see Macmillan’s career path as a bit of a relic of an earlier time. Though recent layoffs show that volatility hasn’t disappeared, it’s still much easier to have a conventional, ladder-climbing career in crypto now than it was eight years ago. But Macmillan thinks following your passions and getting your hands dirty is still the way to go.  “I absolutely think this pathway is still viable,” he said. “There’s absolutely more bulls**t than there was in 2016 because it’s become more obvious how profitable bulls**tting can be. But it’s easy to distinguish yourself from the bullsh**ters by just doing something valuable. Make a real contribution, become a legitimate part of a community. That’s absolutely a path to finding a career.  Read more: CoinDesk Confidential: Auryn Macmillan  “A good example is Marv, who runs all the community stuff for Gnosis Guild now. He jumped in, he was active, he was legitimately engaged. He started engaging with all the discussions, making a bunch of suggestions, and that turned into him now being a core member of Gnosis Guild and running the whole community.”  That said, it’s important not to think of these contributions as a quid pro quo. Getting involved in a project because you hope to get something in return is, strangely, a good way to ensure that doesn’t happen.  “You have to go into a community without the expectation of explicit reward,” said Macmillan. “You should be contributing because it’s something valuable that you want to see in the world. Weirdly, that’s the best way to work on something that could become a long-term career. If you go into it thinking career first, I want to get paid, there’s a tension between that and you actually making an impact.  “And the counter to that,” he cautioned, “Is that sometimes you’ll go into a space, and it won’t get noticed. That’s the risk you have to take, and it’s a good litmus test. If it doesn’t get noticed, or the work doesn’t get the treatment you want, it might not be the place for you.  In the end, Macmillan’s career advice is strikingly simple. “Find projects you’re passionate about, make real contributions. The same paths are available for community managers, for developers, for business development.  “That’s the beauty of how Web3 organizations work: They create this permeable boundary between inside and outside. Just jump in and contribute something valuable.”     More from Future of Work Week  The Crypto Jobs Boom  It may be a bear market, but there are still plenty of jobs to be had at crypto companies.

42422984,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1zkDh,1656427953,FSInsight Accuses Three Arrows Capital of Running a ‘Madoff-Style Ponzi Scheme’,"The crypto industry was “brought to its knees” in recent weeks by an “old-fashioned Madoff-style Ponzi scheme” wrapped in a trade that was similar to the positions that sunk Long Term Capital Management (LTCM),” research firm FSInsight said in a report Friday that looked at the implications of the implosion of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which is also known as 3AC.  Madoff in this scenario would be the founders of 3AC, Su Zhu and Kyle Davies, who used their reputation to “recklessly borrow from just about every institutional lender in the business,” resulting in pain for some high-profile firms in the industry, including Voyager Digital, Babel Finance and BlockFi, Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at FSInsight, wrote in the report. Bernie Madoff was an American financier who ran the largest Ponzi scheme in U.S. history.  At its peak, 3AC had supposed assets under management (AUM) of over $18 billion, the note said. But given that the amount of debt that is now known to have been loaned to the firm, it is unclear how much actual equity was at risk. It is likely that Zhu and Davies were simply “using borrowed funds to repay interest on loans issued by lenders, while ‘cooking their books’ to show massive returns on capital,” the note added.  Read more: 'Staked Ether' Becomes Focus of Crypto Stress, From Celsius to Three Arrows  Given the size of the exposure that companies like Voyager Digital and BlockFi had to the fund, it appears that the vast majority of 3AC’s assets were bought with debt and its collateralization ratio was quite small, according to Farrell.  “The macro conditions preceded destruction in global asset prices, reducing the collateral value of any crypto asset, and 3AC was heavily invested in LUNA/UST, which couldn't have helped the situation, however, we think the downward spiral started with 3AC’s overleveraged bet on Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC),” the note stated.  (Grayscale’s parent company is Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk).  The GBTC trade was highly leveraged, and when the premium-arb trade disappeared, 3AC was still likely locked in GBTC, FSInsight said. Instead of exiting at a small loss, however, 3AC likely doubled down on the trade, expecting the discount to converge to net asset value once the spot exchange-traded fund was approved, Farrell added. Grayscale has applied to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for approval to convert the trust to an ETF. GBTC's share price has been trading at a discount to its net asset value.  FSInsight says the GBTC trade will eventually pay off for patient investors, but the timing is unclear, as the spot ETF might be approved in weeks, but could also take years.  Read more: With Bitwise and Grayscale Decisions Looming, Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval Hopes Are Running Low  ‘Deep value’  As asset prices collapsed and margin calls were triggered, 3AC could no longer hold its “daisy chain of leverage together,” which caused illiquidity issues across the whole crypto lending market, the report said. The overleveraged nature of this arbitrage trade is similar to the types of trades that were the “death knell” for Long Term Capital Management, the report added.  Recent data shows capitulation among bitcoin holders, FSInsight, said, but there remains a risk that growing miner positions could be a source of further selling pressure. While the short-term picture for digital asset prices remains “treacherous”, the market has reached an area of deep value for bitcoin (BTC) that long-term investors should take advantage of, it added.

Miners will be able to shop for hosting services when they buy bitcoin mining computers through Luxor’s brokerage service that was launched earlier this year. Luxor will essentially play the role of a broker, matching miners that need their machines plugged into a hosting provider. Luxor said that it has done over $100 million in trading through its mining rig brokerage service.  “Luxor’s hosting marketplace enables miners to choose hosting providers that meet their unique operational and geographical requirements,” Luxor Director of Business Development Aaron Foster said in a statement. “Rather than a one-size-fits-all approach, Luxor aims to provide a white glove service that removes the uncertainty around hosting decisions,” he added.  In recent months, infrastructure and power supply-related delays, as well as lack of capital, have caused bottlenecks for miners in expanding their operations, with more miners than places to provide power.  ""There have been widespread delays in infrastructure build outs due to supply chain constraints, operational complexity and power delays,” Lauren Lin, Luxor’s operations manager, told CoinDesk. “These problems have led many investors such as family offices, hedge funds, and high-net worth individuals to look at hosting options with established miners to get up and running.”  Hosting is a service that data centers provide to crypto miners in which customers can store their ASICs and mine their preferred digital assets for a fee, without having to build the accompanying infrastructure themselves.  “Bitcoin mining hosting can provide miners with more favorable power rates than they can get at home,” according to Luxor’s statement. “Luxor’s hosting partners offer a range of rates and revenue/profit sharing arrangements, as well as GPU and ASIC hosting,” the statement added.  The new marketplace will have hosting clients in the U.S. and Canada and miners will be able to have as little as one mining rig hosted by some providers, according to Luxor.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/28/luxor-launches-hosting-marketplace-for-bitcoin-miners-amidst-build-out-delays,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/70171d680f1c763814602504edece228e75131f8-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

I’m Lyllah Ledesma, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights.  Price point: Bitcoin drops 2%, tezos trades 8% upwards. Bank of America said in a report that concerns about a ""crypto winter"" have not frozen investor interest.  Market Moves: A look at how and which meme coins are outperforming the broader market.  Price point  Bitcoin (BTC) is down 2% on the day and has flitted between the $20,000 - $21,000 range over the last 24 hours.  “BTC is oscillating prudently around the $19K-$21K range,” said Laurent Kssis, head of Europe at Hashdex. He's watching for any announcements related to Goldman Sachs's (GS) reported efforts to raise money from investors to buy Celsius assets. Those could be positive for the market, he said.  Kssis noted that the market could equally break lower if more companies announce halting of operations where client assets are at risk: “The market is treading very uncomfortably and many investors are waiting for further unpleasant news.”  Bitcoin is down 29% over the last month and has lost 70% of its value from an all-time high reached in November 2021.  Tezos (XTZ) traded 8% up on the day, one of the only assets in the green on Tuesday. XTZ is the currency of Tezos, a multi-purpose blockchain that runs smart contracts.  In traditional markets, U.S. stock futures gained after the news of China’s loosening COVID-19 restrictions, easing concerns over global growth.  Market moves  By Shaurya Malwa  Shiba inu (SHIB) and dogecoin (DOGE) led seven-day returns as bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies broke above resistance levels and stabilized over the weekend.  Crypto and equity markets have rallied over the past week after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled a softened stance on rate increases. Powell said the agency’s commitment to reining in inflation, which is now at a 40-year high, was “unconditional,” adding that he expected economic growth to pick up in the second half after a sluggish start to the year, as previously reported.  Meme coins outperformed the broader market, with SHIB posting returns of over 40% and Dogecoin’s DOGE tokens climbing more than 30% over the period. The tokens fell in the past 24 hours on profit-taking. SHIB lost 6% and DOGE fell 7.4%.  SHIB rose to as high as $0.000011 on Sunday from last week’s low of $0.000008, while DOGE spiked to over 7 cents from last week’s 5-cent low. Such price action caused futures tracking the two tokens to rack up millions of dollars in liquidation losses, Coinglass data show.  Some analysts explained last week’s rally as showcasing speculative behavior from investors making risky bets on the duo’s upside. Others said reasons for caution remain.

The bridge was restarted after an internal audit and external audits by blockchain security firms Verichains and Certik. All user funds are fully backed on a 1:1 basis by the new bridge and users have been made whole, developers said.  The new bridge design includes a circuit-breaker system as a contingency plan to increase the security of the bridge by halting large, suspicious withdrawals, developers said.  Bridges are protocols that enables an exchange of information, cryptocurrency or assets such as non-fungible tokens (NFT) from one blockchain network to another. The Ronin bridge allows funds to flow between Ethereum and the Ronin blockchain.  The March exploit affected Ronin validator nodes for Sky Mavis, the publisher of the popular Axie Infinity game, and the Axie DAO, with attackers stealing some 173,600 ether (ETH) and 25.5 million in USDC. An attacker “used hacked private keys in order to forge fake withdrawals” from the Ronin bridge across two transactions, according to a blog posted at the time.  Ronin took corrective measures at the time, such as reducing token emissions, to prevent the collapse of the Axie Infinity ecosystem. The moves did little to save prices of Axie’s native AXS tokens amid a broader market decline, with prices down 90% since their lifetime highs in November.

While I believe the plan is to publish the full videos in the near future, I’ve always found it easier to pick information up by reading it than by watching or listening to it. This week, I’m continuing my exploration into transcripts with snippets from two conversations held at Consensus: fireside chats with Deputy Treasury Secretary Adewale Adeyemo and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Financial stability  The narrative  I sat down with Deputy Treasury Secretary Adewale Adeyemo earlier this month at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2022 for a fireside chat. I think it was quite enlightening, and I hope you do as well. To that end, some of the discussion is below.  Also: My colleague Zack Seward sat down with Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. I’ve posted a partial transcript of that conversation as well.  Why it matters  Both Adeyemo and Garlinghouse have played significant roles in the crypto industry, particularly over the past 18 months.  These are only partial transcripts that have been edited for brevity. I’ll send around a link when we publish the full videos.  Breaking it down  Nikhilesh De: We've all seen the President's Working Group report, and I know Treasury is working on reports related to that. Could you just provide an update: How are these reports looking? Are there any specific additional policy recommendations you think will come out of them? Or what are you looking at just with stablecoins in general now?  Adewale Adeyemo: I think the truth is that the President's Working Group laid out in lots of ways where we are in terms of stablecoins and went beyond just what Treasury was doing. But the President's Working Group reflected the views of regulators in the space, and it called for legislative action. Now we're engaged in conversations with members of Congress, across parties, because we know this is a bipartisan issue. What we can do here is to provide a regulatory framework that protects financial stability, but also, as we think about the digital asset space, I think it's important for us to think not only about financial stability but also about consumer and investor protections. How do we also think about national security? And how do we think about these things in a way that allows us to promote what I would call responsible innovation, and gives those people who are in this space the ability to innovate, within a sense of “this is the regulatory architecture that will govern here in the United States.”  While we're focused on the United States, I recognize that one of the benefits of digital assets is they're global in nature. And we want to make sure that in the United States, we lead in thinking about these regulatory issues. But in leading, we also bring the rest of the world along with us so that you're facing a regulatory regime that looks similar around the world, rather than differentiated.  As you alluded to, terraUSD and luna collapsed dramatically last month. Are algorithmic stablecoins, which weren't really mentioned in the working group report, something that you'll now be taking a look at? Is that something that Treasury will publish more reports on or recommend action on to prevent that from happening again?  I think the challenge that you have is when a stablecoin isn't very stable, that leaves people with a great deal of concern. Ultimately, one of the things that is true of digital assets, that's true of fiat currency, is that trust is a major part of this. You want to be in a position where people understand the products that they are dealing with. My view is that ultimately, that's why we think legislation in this area is needed in order to give regulators the authorities they need for stablecoins at large.  But I do think you have to look at algorithmic stablecoins and think through what kind of special disclosures, if any, need to be provided there. From my standpoint, one of the most important things we can do for consumers and investors is make sure that they understand the products that they are dealing with, not only in the digital asset space, but in all spaces. Providing them with information that allows them to make better choices is going to be critical here. I think that the reality is that people need to understand where they're putting their money, and what's backing it, frankly, going forward.  You also mentioned the unhosted wallet rule earlier, which I know was kind of put on the back burner in the beginning of 2021. Is that something you're seeing as a rule that the U.S. will actually look to implement? Or is that just more kind of like a framework that you're looking at for potential future rulemaking?  I'm not going to get ahead of our rulemaking process. But I do think that one of the things that we're focused on is how do we address the challenges that unhosted wallets create for national security and for illicit finance. We understand and respect the need for, and the desire to [have] privacy, but we need to make sure that we're also in a place where we're not creating avenues where those who want to move funds illicitly are able to use digital assets more than traditional assets.  We know that criminals and those who are looking to move funds illicitly don't only use digital assets, they use traditional assets as well. The thing we don't want to do is create an advantage for them to move into the digital space. That's not to your advantage, and it's not to our advantage. That's why we think that thinking about the travel rule and the unhosted wallet rule make sense. But we want to do it in a way that addresses the fact that the thing we know that the way we solve these challenges, the way we address them, is about innovation and making sure that we give you the room to innovate within a regulatory architecture that allows us to protect our national security, consumers, investors and financial stability.  Treasury is obviously working on policy recommendations around stablecoins. But a lot of the conversation that I've been hearing, at least from the folks I interact with, is there's this growing question of whether existing laws make sense for addressing digital assets. So that’s taxes, as we just mentioned, know your customer/anti-money laundering but also even some of the independent agencies and how they're approaching it. What are your thoughts? Does it make more sense to try and come up with a “from the ground” brand-new regulatory regime or are the existing rules sufficient?  Yeah, I think it's both. Honestly, you're going to need in some places additional legislation because when you envision some of the rulemakings, no one thought about digital assets. But in other places, we're going to be able to, if we're innovative and meet the innovation of industry, be able to find ways to bring digital assets into the regulatory regime that already exists.  I think this is like when we're trying to think about the travel rule. We think this is a place where we have the tools to be able to think through a regulatory regime that makes sense. I think you're right that all of the regulators are going through this conversation internally in terms of “how do we think about our regulatory regime” and how it applies to digital assets. There you may also see them take some regulatory steps, but also over time, you may also think about what additional regulation is going to be needed.  What I know to be true is something you all know far better than me, [which] is that the digital asset landscape that exists today is not going to be the same one that exists two years from now, three years from now, five years from now. I think the thing as regulators that we need to be able to do and policymakers we need to be able to do is to think through how we build a regulatory architecture that is flexible enough to create opportunities for that innovation in a way that is responsible, and gives people confidence that being engaged in this space is something that is happening within the rules of the road that people expect.  Are there any ideas, tools or projects in the sector that you're really paying attention to, that have your interest on a personal level?  I think the thing I'm paying attention to in this space, and the same thing I'm paying attention to, across the financial sector in general, is, what can we do in terms of financial inclusion? It's a major issue for me, not only internationally, I mentioned Afghanistan. But even think about here in the United States, there are so many places where you don't have access to finance. I think the question is, “how do we make the payment system more efficient and effective going forward?” I think the key is going to be how do we ensure that as more people participate, you have the right types of consumer protections in place, and you have the right types of transparency.  Ultimately, you want to be able to provide remittances at far lower cost to people. I know that there are communities all over this country where people are sending money back to families and other countries, and they are being charged a great deal of money to do that. What we can do to reduce the frictions and the cost and that space, I think it's critical. It's also critical in our country to think through how we can use digital assets to reduce the cost of transacting here. So those are the things that I'm paying the most attention to.  Ripple’s Garlinghouse  CoinDesk Deputy Editor-in-Chief Zachary Seward spoke to Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse at Consensus 2022. A partial transcript follows.  Brad Garlinghouse: The headline for me is I feel like [the Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuit] looks good in large part; I think it's very clear. The more that has come out, the facts are on our side. I think it's more and more clear [that] the law is on our side. But we have spent … when this is all said and done, we will have spent over $100 million on legal fees fighting the SEC, and the dynamic there is, in my opinion, the SEC bullies companies into settlement because they can't afford to fight.  The reason why this fight is so important isn't just for Ripple. It's really for the whole industry. It was literally four years ago this week that Bill Hinman, the [then] director of Corporation Finance at the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, gave a speech saying that [ether] was not a security. And by the way, let me be clear, I do not think ETH is security. I don't think XRP is a security. But at the time we viewed this as “isn't it great that four years ago, we're starting to provide some leadership and some clarity.” And I view this as actually a very positive sign. I remember there's emails which now the SEC has read from our internal documents, where I sent the team a note saying, “Hey, this is great news. We now have clarity of how the SEC is thinking about this. They used some parameters around decentralization and what have you.”  Look at the fact that four years have gone by. And we still don't have clarity about how the SEC is going to say what is and is not a security. It's worse, actually. Now the SEC, the current chair, [Gary] Gensler is really walking back the statement around ETH. He has been asked directly “is ether a security,” [but] he won't answer the question. How can we be competitive in the United States in an industry where the primary regulator will not provide that clarity?  My experience in crypto is the vast, vast, vast majority of people want to do right by the rules. But you’ve got to know what the rules are. I think the Senate bill that you're describing, I think is a constructive step in that regard, and [can] provide some clarity. There's a bill that was introduced in the House side called the Digital Commodity Exchange Act, which we certainly have been very active advocates of.  I think maybe the most important thing is this is forward progress. I expect there will be some hearings around these bills, and when there's hearings that bring attention to the lack of clarity, and I think it catalyzes and builds momentum to win, I think it’s open for debate. I've talked to some very smart people that think realistically, either the House side or the Senate side, it’s you know, a year away before something gets passed, which, you know, that's a long time from now. And I think the U.S. every day is losing competitiveness, relative to other markets that have clear regulation, you know, clear leaning in.  So it's been 18 months, it's been a bit of stasis. But certainly, you've been doing a lot of work, the business of running this company does not stop, how are you describing the value proposition of Ripple Labs here in 2022?  We only work with regulated institutions, globally. Ninety-five percent of our customers are non-U.S. customers already. Certainly the U.S. case has – we've been able to have one or two contracts we signed here in the United States, but it's been slow going in the U.S. But the great news is demand for one of our core products, we call On Demand Liquidity – that's the product using XRP to move liquidity for institutions that grew already at a billion (dollar) run rate last year, that grew [eight times] year on year and Q1. The demand is clearly there.  And I think one of the opportunities for everyone in crypto is to make sure we're solving real problems. I get super excited about real-world enterprise solutions. NFTs [non-fungible tokens] are certainly an area that I think is here to stay. I maybe somewhat controversially said recently that I thought NFTs were underhyped. People were kind of surprised because they're pretty hyped. What I was calling out is I don't know how to think about NFTs in the context of [say,] is one artist better than the other? Is a Van Gogh worth more than Picasso? I don't know. What I do know is there's a lot of NFTs in terms of tokenization of assets, around real estate, around patent portfolios, around licensing rights. There's all kinds of stuff that I think NFTs will manifest in a way that is great for industries by reducing transaction costs, making these industries more efficient. That's where I think NFTs are underhyped, in terms of how they will integrate into our economy broadly.  I also will say … I think all boats rise, and one of the most frustrating things and you know, CoinDesk has certainly written about this, the tribalism in crypto is holding us all back. We just got to f**king stop it. We have to, we're all on the same team. I really believe that what's good for crypto is good for Ripple. I try to be really careful about, even on stuff that I feel like I don't understand, I'm not trying to bad mouth … But I think what's good for crypto is good for everybody in the industry. I think the tribalism holds us back in a really big way. I am a person who believes in climate change. I'm a person who believes that carbon production is something we got to pay attention to. Again, we're all on the same team here. I think the extent we can use more efficient technologies for solutions, then we should use those. I will pick on the Yuga Labs experience, the transaction fees – let's just boil down. Blockchains are all about removing middleman costs, right?  So the Yuga Labs experience, the transaction fees were 40%. I own bitcoin [BTC], I've said that publicly before, I own ETH, I own XRP, not surprisingly – I think all of them can do well. I think the energy dynamic is a real one. I think we should be intellectually honest about what the real math is, and what are the implications? … I didn't go sell bitcoin because it's proof-of-work.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  It’s starting to seem unlikely we’ll see any rapid movement on filling in some of these current roles that have acting heads.

42393975,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brwbjZ,1656422280,Survey: Market Downturn Hasn't Chilled Optimism About Crypto Jobs,"As the debate continues about whether we are in a new crypto winter, workers remain optimistic, as long as they don’t have to go to the office. That is one takeaway from the CoinDesk Crypto Work Survey.  This article is part of CoinDesk's Future of Work Week.  The Crypto Work Survey arrived during a particularly volatile moment. When it started on June 9, the first signs of weakness in the crypto job market were just becoming public with the announcement that Coinbase would freeze hiring and rescind new job offers. Later, the crypto exchange said it was laying off 1,100 workers, or 18% of its workforce.  Given the cascade of dreadful industry and market news during the following three weeks until the survey ended on Monday, the questions regarding job security, organizational growth and job features provided some interesting insights into workers' outlook. Overall, respondents reported their companies were holding steady or growing, and most felt secure in their jobs.  The 170 survey respondents represented a broad cross section of workers. The majority, or 60%, were between the ages of 22 and 40, with just three under 21 and only 11 who were 61 or older. About one-third worked in organizations with fewer than 50 employees, and another third for organizations between 50 to 999 employees. Three-quarters, or 76%, worked for private rather than public organizations.  Fifty-seven percent said their organizations were actively hiring, and 31% said that their organizations were holding steady. Only 6% reported that their organizations were actively reducing headcount. Overall, 26% strongly agreed, and 38% agreed with the statement: I am satisfied with my overall job security. In contrast, just 9% disagreed, and another 9% strongly disagreed with the statement.  Against the backdrop of the price of bitcoin dropping from $30,249 on June 9 to $20,722 by Monday afternoon, the responses about how workers were paid may indicate that crypto workers can tolerate price volatility, even in their pay. Nearly a quarter of respondents, or 23%, had the choice of being paid at least partly in crypto, and 67% were paid in fiat only, such as U.S. dollars.  When asked whether they were satisfied with their pay options, the ones who have a choice were nearly unanimously satisfied. Only 10 respondents are paid in crypto only, and just two of those people were dissatisfied.  We attempted to discover what job features or values are most important, besides salary. The single least appreciated factor among the 10 choices we listed is the ability to be paid at least partly in crypto. More than 42% of respondents ranked it dead last of 10 job features. By far and away the most valuable feature of a job is the ability to work remotely, with 52% of respondents ranking it in their top three priorities for a job. And job security? Only 32% of respondents ranked it among their top three most important factors in a job.  Getting to the heart of the matter, 42% of survey respondents reported that love for the work or the organization’s mission is among their top priorities.

Users can now put their cryptocurrencies to work on Alkemi's protocol without them leaving the safety of their Ledger wallet.

As a result of such aggression of sellers, the price fell from $100 to $13- a colossal fall that could push investors into complete despair in this cryptocurrency. However, increased trading volumes - this is a good sign that in the long run, this cryptocurrency is interesting to investors. It is also worth paying attention to the local lows of 2021.

The report follows up from the bank's ""Web3 & Digital Assets Day"" conference, which took place last week.  Conversations with some of the 160 clients who attended the event made clear that “blockchain technology and the digital asset ecosystem are here to stay,” the report said, and the bank remains optimistic for mainstream digital asset adoption.  The bank said some speakers pointed out that the most innovative projects were built during previous downturns in the market, and that recent declines, while painful, are “likely healthy for the ecosystem’s development over the long term.”  “Client engagement continues to grow and focus remains on the rapid development and disruptive nature of blockchain technology, despite falling token prices and headlines suggesting the ecosystem’s demise has arrived,” the note said.  Participants speaking at the event said regulatory clarity is critical for institutional and corporate engagement, which could ultimately speed up real-world use and result in mainstream adoption as consumer confidence in the sector increases, the note added.  It was a consensus view that institutional investors and corporates are preparing to enter the digital assets ecosystem, but remain on the sidelines until a comprehensive regulatory framework is established, the report said.  BofA said digital asset products may attract the first billion users, but the “next billion will likely require improved bridges between the fiat and crypto ecosystems and the creation of a crypto-native ecosystem, in which individuals are unaware of the applications that leverage blockchain technology.”  The bank reiterated its view that blockchain technology delivers the most significant evolution of software since the internet, adding that the emerging ecosystem of Web3 applications has the “potential to transform every industry.”  Read more: Bank of America Survey Shows Consumers Aren’t Done With Crypto Yet",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Will Canny,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/28/bank-of-america-says-crypto-winter-concerns-havent-frozen-investor-interest,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/611c0e766fc4601d67ccf9cbaf5c0c75284fc021-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42423013,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1znth,1656417600,Peaq Raises $6M in Funding Round Led by Fundamental Labs,"Peaq, a Web3 network that offers decentralized infrastructure and tools to builders and users of decentralized applications, or dapps, for machines, has raised $6 million in seed funding, the company announced Tuesday.  Fundamental Labs led the funding round. Other investors included HashKey Capital, GSR, Delta-v Capital, Mulana Capital, Cypher Capital, GravityX Capital, Waterdrip Capital, Ceras Ventures, Master Ventures and Moonrock Capital.  The fresh capital will support the expansion of peaq’s network, which aims to power an economy in which machines have overtaken millions of previously people-powered jobs by allowing users to create, govern and generate income from dapps for machine-generated goods and services.  The funds will primarily go toward adding to the network’s development team, with some money also reserved for the launch of new products and features to the peaq ecosystem and for increasing awareness around the project in the run-up to peaq’s bid for the Polkadot parachain.  Peaq co-founder Till Wendler said the network’s buildout is an “absolute necessity” as tech companies prepare for the wider adoption of Web3 and smart technologies such as artificial intelligence.  “Today’s funding milestone allows us to continue to strengthen and diversify peaq’s offering as the network that powers a fully decentralized machine economy,” Wendler said. “The enablement of wealth creation in the economy-of-things (EoT) based on aligned economic incentives, shared ownership, universal accessibility and peer-to-peer offering of goods and services is an absolute necessity as the world moves forward with Web3 adoption and as our reliance on AI increases.”  Dapps are smart contract-powered, blockchain-based applications that provide similar services to traditional consumer applications while granting users greater control over their finances and data.  Dapps are most commonly built on the Ethereum blockchain, where they cannot be controlled by a single authority. Without centralized intermediaries to manage their data, users have more control over their finances and data.  Peaq enables users to build and monetize dapps designed for compatibility with vehicles, robots and devices. On peaq, users can build dapps for bike and car shares, electric-vehicle charging stations and peer-to-peer energy trading services.  In April, peaq announced it would run for the Polkadot parachain, allowing the network to achieve seamless cross-chain interoperability with the rest of the Polkadot ecosystem and enhancing the network’s security.  Polkadot, a self-labeled layer 0 blockchain protocol, enables layer 1 parachains like Substrate, on which peaq is built, to securely communicate with each other. As a result, users can easily transfer assets across Polkadot networks without relying on issue-ridden cross-chain bridges.  Peaq plans to bring “a whole new category of liquidity” to the Polkadot ecosystem by introducing machine decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens, according to the Web3 network’s blog.  It also plans to bring more sovereign economic actors to the Polkadot ecosystem by giving millions of machines their own ""self-sovereign machine identities"" or ​​digital identities that allow machines, vehicles, devices and robots to share their identities with each other, with people and with their environment without relying on centralized third parties.

42423008,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1znnh,1656417600,Anchorage Digital to Introduce Ether Staking for Institutions as Move to PoS Approaches,"Institutional crypto custody firm Anchorage Digital is set to introduce ether (ETH) staking for institutions, the company announced Tuesday.  The San Francisco-based federally chartered cryptocurrency bank will offer ETH holders the opportunity to earn rewards for helping to secure and extend the Ethereum blockchain once the network moves to a proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism later this year.  The announcement follows reports that “the Merge” – the oft-delayed upgrade that will shift the blockchain to PoS from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism – could reach completion in coming months. The transition to PoS, which is intended to be faster and more energy efficient than PoW, is now expected to occur in August.  Staking is the process of helping validate new cryptocurrency transactions on a proof-of-stake blockchain. Participants set aside some of their ether, get the opportunity to validate transactions and in return receive a reward. Anchorage is offering to manage that process for institutions that wish to participate.  “Institutional staking is definitely a win for institutional investors because before investors were very uncomfortable with how to participate in staking,” Anchorage President Diogo Mónica told CoinDesk. “[Ethereum] is the biggest network to do proof-of-stake, and having it bank-supported legitimizes [staking] as a real alternative to proof of work.”  Anchorage Digital will provide stakers with dedicated validators for their positions in exchange for a fee charged on what they accrue.  Staking rewards  Investors can reap two types of rewards through staking.  The first type is a block reward, which is earned by proposing and creating new blocks on the blockchain. Those rewards are added directly to the investor’s staking balance and cannot be withdrawn until Ethereum enables the functionality sometime after the Merge.  The second type of reward is a transaction priority fee, which is awarded to validators in exchange for processing transactions on the network. That will accrue directly to the holder's Ethereum Mainnet balance, which means the funds will become liquid immediately and can be used for additional staking.  Rewards for validators are expected to double to about 8% or 9% after the Merge as transaction priority fees currently paid to miners start to be distributed to validators, according to Ethereum researcher Justin Drake.  “One of our major holdings is about to go through a pretty interesting transition in which you're going to be highly incentivized through the generation of return yield staking games to actually have your assets staked,” Mónica said. “So there's a little bit of a mad rush to have a partner that can actually do staking.”  Crypto market decline  The recent decline in the crypto market has little effect on the bigger picture for ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Even after the ether price dipped to below $1,000 to a 52-week low, there are uses for the altcoin that aren’t tied to its price, Mónica said.  “There's use cases like stablecoin settlements and payments that are winning across fintechs, corporates and large companies like Visa that are totally independent from speculative crypto prices,” said Mónica. “Those types of use cases are accelerating through the bear market or, at a minimum, are not being affected, because they’re not price related.”  Read More: How a Post-Merge Ethereum Could Attract Institutional Investment",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Elizabeth Napolitano,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/28/anchorage-digital-to-introduce-ether-staking-for-institutions-as-move-to-pos-approaches,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4b62b24e96766ef576fedaa250a8992eb9cb52cf-1333x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Crypto and equity markets have rallied over the past week after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled a softened stance on rate increases. Powell said the agency’s commitment to reining in inflation, which is now at a 40-year high, was “unconditional,” adding that he expected economic growth to pick up in the second half after a sluggish start to the year, as previously reported.  Meme coins outperformed the broader market, with SHIB posting returns of over 40% and Dogecoin’s DOGE tokens climbing more than 30% over the period. The tokens fell in the past 24 hours on profit-taking. SHIB lost 6% and DOGE fell 7.4%.  Bitcoin's seven-day gain now stands at just over 2%, with ether returning 8%. Binance coin (BNB) and XRP gained 9%, while Cardano’s ADA and Polkadot’s DOT were little changed at 0.4% lower.  SHIB rose to as high as $0.000011 on Sunday from last week’s low of $0.000008, while DOGE spiked to over 7 cents from last week’s 5-cent low. Such price action caused futures tracking the two tokens to rack up millions of dollars in liquidation losses, Coinglass data show.  Some analysts explained last week’s rally as showcasing speculative behavior from investors making risky bets on the duo’s upside. Others said reasons for caution remain.  “Traders buying meme tokens in this environment should be cautious before investing heavily in this asset class,” said Sebastian Ganjali, head of strategy, at trading developer Kryll.  Nevertheless, some observers said there may have been fundamental reasons behind the gains. “The parabolic move by SHIB is mainly fueled by the coming Shibarium protocol,” shared Adam O’Neill, CMO at crypto exchange Bitrue, in an email. “This move is also partly coming from SHIB burnt token that has reached a total of 400 trillion milestone.”  Bitcoin dropped under $21,000 in European hours on Tuesday as traders took profits, causing a 1.4% drop in crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours.

The firm, which has been running for six months and has already made a handful of seed investments in the $2 million-$4 million range, is helmed by former Aztec CEO Tom Walton-Pocock. The senior team includes Celo cryptography lead Kobi Gurkan and Gregoire Le Jeune, the former head of growth at Oiler Network, according to a press release.  Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) technology allows two parties on the internet, such as an app and a user, to verify information with each other without sharing the underlying data related to that information. ZKPs have been used to create privacy-centric cryptocurrencies in the early days of crypto, and later became an integral component when it comes to scaling blockchains such as Ethereum.  “Last summer we started thinking about producing a research laboratory with a focus on cryptography,” said Walton-Pocock in an interview. “When we got a call from Alan Howard this presented us with an opportunity to get Geometry going far quicker than we previously imagined.”  So far Geometry has led a $4 million seed investment round in Ingonyama, a zero-knowledge semiconductor company based in Israel, and also led the $2 million seed financing round of Soap Labs, the company bringing cross-venue liquidity to the non-fungible token (NFT) market.  The firm has also participated in blockchain interoperability firm Socket, the seed round of Risc0, the general-purpose zkVM powered by STARKs, and formed a strategic arrangement with Matchbox DAO, a new Web3-native gaming incubator to use Geometry’s cryptographic libraries.  Geometry’s “composite combination” of research and investing was incubated by Alan Howard’s WebN Group, Walton-Pocock said, adding that “the opportunities for zero-knowledge extend into every aspect of Web3.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/28/alan-howard-backed-cryptography-investor-geometry-emerges-from-stealth,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a84fbe2cba145481ac893c3d6eae7fd48a0165c-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Scammers Develop New Relationships With Targets Fraudsters may get in touch with their victim by pretending to be a friend, lover, or family member, and request money for a financial emergency or debt. Requests to deal with unusual payment methods, such as bitcoin, are a warning sign that something might not be right. To help you identify a cryptocurrency fraud, the Office of Consumer Affairs and Business Regulation put together a list of indicators. Such a scam would demand payment in cryptocurrency, which is a &apos;red signal.&apos; Therefore, you need to watch out for red flags like friend requests on social media from brand-new or inactive profiles, speedy matches on dating apps but refusals to meet up in person. According to research released by the FTC at the beginning of this month, from January 2021 to March of this year, customers lost more than $1 billion as a result of fraud related to cryptocurrencies.

The advantage that buyers kept at the end of May was lost. This is a range of $0.08. In the past, this range was a historical high. In February 2021, buyers stopped their aggressive growth wave for a few weeks just after the DOGE price met the $0.08 mark. Moving back to the present, we see that 4 weeks of weak but constant pressure from sellers was enough to take control of this range. Now buyers are in a difficult situation. Yes, the DOGE price again tested the bottom of the fall channel and began a rebound. However, whether the future of this rebound is above $0.08 is still unclear. Source: https://www.tradingview.com/x/uN3IM4br/ The weekly chart shows us that the first meeting of the DOGE price with a mark of $0.08 took place in favor of sellers. If the purchase does not change the situation by the end of the week and the DOGE price closes below the critical mark, we will expect a re-test of the $0.053 mark. It is after the test of this mark that buyers can gain new strength to break the mark of $0.08 and the test of $0.11.

On Monday, the exploiter moved over 18,000 ether (ETH), worth over $22 million at the time of writing, to three wallets.

This followed Coinbase's (COIN) decision to reduce its headcount by over 1,100 employees. BlockFi and Crypto.com also laid off a total of 400 employees.  The cryptocurrency market has slumped from an aggregated $2.9 trillion market cap to $938 billion over the past seven months, with bitcoin (BTC) now trading at $20,800 after hitting an all-time high of $68,980 in November.  Huobi's native exchange token (HT) was down 1.16% over the past 24-hours at $5.30.  Huobi did not respond to CoinDesk's request for comment at press time.

Scammers may be taking advantage of June being Pride Month to target this community, the Massachusetts Government said on Monday, citing a prior warning from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).  ""Fraudsters may contact their victim impersonating a friend, partner or family member asking for funds due to an emergency or debt,"" according to the warning. ""Alternatively, scammers will develop new relationships with their target, usually with romantic intentions to then receive monetary gifts and steal personal information.""  A ""red flag"" for such a scam would be a request of payment in cryptocurrency, it added.  Therefore, warning signs to look out for include social media friend requests from new profiles or ones with minimal prior activity and matches on dating apps that move quickly but refuse in-person connection.  At the start of this month, the FTC produced analysis saying consumers had lost over $1 billion in crypto-linked fraud from January 2021 through to March this year. Romance scams was in the top three most prevalent types of fraud alongside bogus investment schemes and business/government impersonation frauds.

42423019,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1zo5h,1656399600,Final Toncoin Mined Ahead of Transition to Proof-of-Stake,"The final TON was mined in the early hours of June 28, signaling toncoin's transition from a largely proof-of-work (PoW) model to proof-of-stake (PoS).  From now on, new toncoins will only enter circulation by PoS validation, resulting in a roughly 75% decrease of new TON entering the network to 200,000 daily.  The TON blockchain already runs on PoS technology, but its initial token distribution was enabled by mining as opposed to a coin offering that PoS tokens usually use. The mining element prevented just a few participants from accumulating a significant number of coins.  “In PoW consensus mechanisms, anyone with the appropriate equipment can become a miner, creating an honest and even distribution of tokens amongst participants in a network,” the TON Foundation said Tuesday.  The TON Foundation, stewards of toncoin and its surrounding ecosystem, referred to this combination as an “initial proof-of-work” (IPoW) mechanism and claim that it created a best of both worlds approach between PoW and PoS.  PoW, the mechanism used by the Bitcoin network, has the drawbacks of being energy intensive and slow, making it expensive and needing a lot of time for transactions to be validated. Ethereum, whose ETH is the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is migrating to a PoS model.  The transition marks the continuation of the TON Foundation’s development of the blockchain project, which messaging app Telegram abandoned in 2020 following a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Members of the TON community, however, formed the Ton Foundation and continued to develop the blockchain, rebranding the project Toncoin from the original TON.  While the reincarnated TON is not affiliated with Telegram, it does have the messaging app’s endorsement.  In April, crypto payments in TON were added to Telegram using the app’s “@wallet” bot.

When the nation tried to reward those who had contributed to the fundraiser by sending crypto wallet holders complimentary NFTs, a slew of scammers took advantage of the government&apos;s generosity, causing the operation to cease. Rug pull scams like this, where cyber criminals drain money from unsuspecting investors, aren&apos;t uncommon in the crypto space, unfortunately. Shortly following the Ukraine rug pull, in March this year, hackers discovered a weakness in the Ronin blockchain used by popular play-to-earn platform Axie Infinity. In the security breach, the scammers ended up stealing $165 million from Axie&apos;s parent company, Sky Mavis. In addition to rug pull scams, cryptocurrency exchanges can be compromised through poor security or fraud. This is what happened in 2014 when the Mt. Gox exchange collapsed in a years-long attack by hackers. By the time the breach was detected, a loss of between $300 million and $480 million of users&apos; funds had occurred. Since the attack, it has been estimated that $1.5 billion in cryptocurrencies have been stolen from exchanges. Blockchain&apos;s utility isn&apos;t limited to just cryptocurrency, though.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin falls but stays well above $20,000. Other major cryptos are in the red.  Insights: Crypto helped Nvidia's bottom line, but it hasn't been a major cause of the stock's steep decline.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $20,800, down over 1% in the past 24 hours. Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was changing hands at roughly $1,200, down less than a percentage point but at about the same level it has held for the past week, as investors continued their cautious approach to riskier assets. Trading was light.  ""People are still using the next several months to determine where this is going, where this will bottom out, not just in crypto,"" Hany Rashwan, founder of 21Shares, a provider of crypto exchange-traded products, said on CoinDesk's ""First Mover"" program, noting crypto's correlation to equity markets that rebounded last week after months of almost nonstop declines.  Other major cryptos were also in the red with celsius (CEL), the token of Celsius Network, a troubled crypto lender, falling by as much as over 16% and UNI dropping nearly 11%. MATIC – a big winner last week after Polygon, the project the token represents, introduced a privacy product for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) – returned a sizable portion of its gains, also tumbling about 11% at one point.  Large-scale stock indexes dropped slightly with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500, which contains a heavy tech component, both down less than a percentage point. The S&P 500 closed Friday with its biggest single-day gain in two years amid the revision of a major report showing consumers slightly more upbeat about inflation in the future and small signs of an economic cooling that might enable the Federal Reserve to scale back its monetary hawkishness later in the year.  The U.S. Census Bureau's durable-goods report released Monday showed orders in May climbed higher than estimated and a rise in pending-home sales for the month, according to the National Association of Realtors. That countered the belief that inflation won't be as high as feared.  Despite recent debacles in the crypto sector, including the implosion of the terraUSD stablecoin (UST) and liquidity problems at crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, some analysts struck an optimistic note, particularly about decentralized finance (DeFi) projects that have weathered recent storms. In a market recap, Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca Research, highlighted the 20%-30% spike in some cases last week for digital assets, ""led by the most beaten-down sectors, DeFi and NFTs/Gaming.""  ""The cynic in me would dismiss these gains as a 'bear market rally' or merely short-covering, but the bull case is that DeFi protocols and applications did their job while their centralized exchange/lending platforms (CeFi) did not,"" Dorman wrote. ""That’s what led to the bounce in DeFi, which trickled down to the rest of the market.  ""The carnage in the past six weeks has been very real, but every company that is currently facing solvency or going concern issues is a centralized company with a CEO, a board of directors and human decision-makers. Not a single line of code from DeFi or a smart contract is capable of making the costly decisions that these companies made.""  Markets  S&P 500: 3,900 -0.3%  DJIA: 31,438 -0.2%  Nasdaq: 11,524 -0.7%  Gold: $1,823 -0.4%  Insights  Despite GPU’s Ties to Mining, Nvidia Isn’t Much of an Ethereum Macro Proxy  A few years ago, it was nearly impossible to buy a graphics processing unit (GPU) add-in board (AIB) for your PC.  Gamers who wanted to upgrade their PC were out of luck. General purpose GPU compute (GPGPU), the ability to harness the chip’s ability to do massive amounts of parallel computation, is just as important for crypto mining as it is for creating photo-realistic graphics for games. So miners bought all they could, displacing gamers in the process.  Nvidia, which makes the GPU chip and its add-in board partners and which make the card itself, had quite the bull run with stocks of Gigabyte, MSI, and Zotac experiencing double-digit gains. Nvidia tried to downplay its exposure to crypto, and that ultimately led to a fine from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The data, however, doesn’t lie: The company sold more cards because of crypto mining.  But let’s be clear: Nvidia isn’t a crypto mining company or a proxy of one. Its stratospheric rise from a $5 stock at the beginning of 2015 to nearly $330 at the end of 2021 isn’t just because of mining, although mining did make a material impact on its income statement. Rather, the same technology, GPGPU Compute, was a Cambrian explosion-like event that unlocked a world of efficiency increases in data centers, allowing for massive advances in things like artificial intelligence and big data.  Data center has become the largest segment for Nvidia, surpassing gaming, last quarter. That has been in the works for a while, as the segment has been posting double-digit growth since 2018. That also means that Nvidia is exposed to slowing investments in data centers as a technology-led recession rips through Wall Street. Research firm Gartner put the growth in IT spending at 9.5% in 2021 and predicts that growth will slow to 4% in 2022.  So while crypto and mining added to Nvidia’s bottom line, it's not the reason why the company’s stock has led the board in declining tech stocks.
