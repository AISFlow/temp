42385419,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB1rOF,1608672010,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Recovers to Nearly $24K; Ether Rides Bitcoin’s 'Coattails',"Bitcoin’s price recovered quickly from Monday’s small market sell-off, approaching a new resistant level at $24,000 Tuesday. Traders and analysts said it is because demand has continued to rise despite minor negative market movement.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $23,433.85 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 2.64% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $22,384.13-$23,629.40 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC above its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.    There were few reactions from the market on Monday’s sharp drop to Tuesday’s fast recovery.      “The bitcoin market is highly levered at the time and volatility spiked sharply with the $20,000 break,” said macro cryptocurrency analyst Alex Kruger. A “$1,000 move (~5%) under current circumstances is rather ordinary. Expect such price action to continue until leverage and [trading] volumes come down.”      With most people already headed out for the holidays, bitcoin’s trading volumes on the eight major exchanges tracked in the CoinDesk 20 have not come down since November.      It is possible Monday’s small drop in pricing was viewed as another great opportunity for many new and big players in the crypto space, traders and analysts told CoinDesk, and that partly drove the quick recovery on bitcoin’s price on Tuesday. It is now approaching $24,000.      Read More: Riot Purchases Additional 15,000 Mining Machines From Bitmain      “Regardless of the short term, the trend is showing demand rising for bitcoin, especially by big players that want to get into the crypto market,” said Alessandro Andreotti, an over-the-counter crypto trader, who also said $24,000 will be the next resistance level.      “If it was my guess, the dump was related to macro fears related to the coronavirus,” Ryan Watkins, research analyst at Messari, told CoinDesk. “I think it’s pretty clear the bullish trend is intact and I expect dips to be bought from here on out.”      Another potential reason for recent volatility is the differing attitudes towards bitcoin by investors in different parts of the world.      “European and American institutions are bullish, Asian retail investors are bearish,” Simons Chen, executive director of investment and trading at Hong Kong-based crypto lender Babel Finance, told CoinDesk. “Therefore, prices have remained volatile recently. But as traditional institutions continue to enter the market, a new price rally is only a matter of time.”      Notably, bitcoin’s price traded lower during Asia trading hours, but has been trending up since the markets opened in the U.S. Tuesday.      Bitcoin’s volatility has remained much higher than the volatility of the S&P 500 stock index and of gold, and has gone up since October, according to data compiled by CoinDesk.

Like most of the other cryptocurrencies, ether’s price has followed bitcoin’s recovery, yet it has still largely underperformed the oldest cryptocurrency.      Ether ""looks to simply be riding the coattails of bitcoin,” Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5, said. “All said, the ether/bitcoin cross continues to grind in favor of bitcoin, and there's limited reason to see that derail.

42385420,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB1rKT,1608668578,"SEC Sues Ripple Over 7-Year, $1.3B 'Ongoing' XRP Sale","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) believes Ripple Labs violated federal securities laws in selling the XRP cryptocurrency to retail consumers.      According to a lawsuit filed Tuesday, Ripple raised $1.3 billion over a seven-year period to retail investors through its sale of XRP on an ongoing basis. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced Monday that the SEC had told his company of the impending lawsuit, and published the payment firm’s Wells Response, a document that seeks to tell the SEC why certain activity did not violate U.S. securities laws.      The San Francisco-based fintech firm has long maintained that XRP the cryptocurrency is separate from Ripple the company. The cryptocurrency was often referred to as “ripple” through early 2018 and shared a logo with the company until later that year.      The impact could be wide-ranging: several exchanges list XRP in the U.S., with only one deciding to delist the cryptocurrency ahead of the Tuesday lawsuit. If the SEC prevails, platforms that continued to list the crypto may have to register as securities exchanges.      According to the complaint, which names CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Chairman Chris Larsen in addition to Ripple Labs as defendants, Ripple violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 by failing to register XRP as a security or seeking an exemption.      “Over a years-long unregistered offering of securities (the ‘Offering’), Ripple was able to raise at least $1.38 billion by selling XRP without providing the type of financial and managerial information typically provided in registration statements and subsequent periodic and current filings,” the filing said. “Ripple used this money to fund its operations without disclosing how it was doing so, or the full extent of its payments to others to assist in its efforts to develop a ‘use’ for XRP and maintain XRP secondary trading markets.”    Ongoing debate    XRP’s status under U.S. securities law has been a subject of debate for several years.      The Crypto Rating Council, a joint venture spearheaded by Coinbase and supported by cryptocurrency exchanges like Bittrex, Kraken and OKCoin, among other entities, assessed that XRP looked more like a security than a non-security.      The group has specified that its ratings should not be taken as legal advice, but rather its members’ assessment of how different cryptocurrencies might fall within the U.S. regulatory umbrella. CrossTower, one of its members, delisted XRP earlier Tuesday after news of the lawsuit first came out, though other trading platforms have yet to weigh in on whether they’ll consider doing so.      XRP allegedly being centralized through control by a single entity was even seen as an attractive aspect by some. Wall Street veteran Brian Kelly told CNBC in 2018 that, ""I happen to like the fact that they have several banks using it and they have a company ... that is out there trying to make the value of the currency go higher.""      See also: An SEC Victory in Ripple Case Would Render XRP ‘Untradeable,’ Market Pros Say      On the other hand, former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Christopher Giancarlo has said that in his view, XRP should be “considered a currency or a medium of exchange,” not a security.      Giancarlo cited the Howey Test – a Supreme Court case that has been used as a chief standard for assessing whether or not something is a security – in his reasoning.      In short, Howey states that something is a security if it 1) is an investment of money in b) a common enterprise with c) a reasonable expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others. According to Giancarlo, XRP investors were not promised returns or a share of Ripple’s profits.      The SEC sees it differently.      “At all relevant times during the Offering, XRP was an investment contract and therefore a security subject to the registration requirements of the federal securities laws,” the lawsuit said.      According to the SEC, the defendants allegedly said that the main reason someone might buy XRP is to speculate on its price, with the complaint quoting Ripple employees from as far back as 2013.      “Similarly, in its official application to the NYDFS for XRP II in 2016, Ripple acknowledged that buyers were ‘purchasing XRP for speculative purposes,’” the complaint said.    Information asymmetry    Much of the SEC’s complaint contends that there was asymmetric information about XRP. The defendants allegedly “created an information vacuum” that let Ripple, Larsen and Garlinghouse sell XRP to a market that didn’t have a lot of information about the cryptocurrency.      “Defendants continue to hold substantial amounts of XRP and – with no registration statement in effect – can continue to monetize their XRP while using the information asymmetry they created in the market for their own gain, creating substantial risk to investors,” the complaint said.      David Schwartz, Ripple’s CTO, is cited in the complaint as saying that Ripple’s “publicly announced strategy” was to “do everything we can to maximize the price of XRP over at least the time it takes us to sell the XRP we have.”      “The people who created XRP are pretty much the same as the people who created Ripple and they created Ripple originally to, among other things, distribute XRP,” he said in a tweet (though he’s identified as “Cryptographer-1” in the complaint).      Ripple even knew that XRP may fulfill the requirements of being a security, the SEC claimed, saying the company received a pair of memos in 2012 from “an international law firm” which stated that there was some risk of this assessment.      Many of the comments in the SEC complaint seem to match or are similar to statements used in a two-year-old investor lawsuit against the company.      The SEC also heavily cites internal emails and communications between Ripple employees and board members in its complaint.      Part of this information vacuum is the fact that On-Demand Liquidity, a Ripple product which uses XRP, did not have organic or market-driven volume, the SEC alleged.      ""Though Ripple touts ODL as a cheaper alternative to traditional payment rails, at least one money transmitter (the 'Money Transmitter') found it to be much more expensive and therefore not a product it wished to use without significant compensation from Ripple,"" the complaint said.      It appears to be referring to MoneyGram; it said the majority of XRP trading on ODL between ""early 2019 and July 2020"" was conducted by the unnamed transmitter. Ripple took a stake in MoneyGram in June 2019 and as has been publicly disclosed, the payments firm has compensated MoneyGram for using XRP.      ""Specifically, from 2019 through June 2020, Ripple paid the Money Transmitter 200 million XRP, which the Money Transmitter immediately monetized by selling XRP into the public market, typically on the very days it received XRP from Ripple. The Money Transmitter publicly disclosed earning over $52 million in fees and incentives from Ripple through September 2020,"" the lawsuit said.      The amount matches details in MoneyGram's public filings.      ""Ripple and Garlinghouse did not disclose to XRP investors or the public the full extent of incentives that Ripple provided to the Money Transmitter in return for its assistance in increasing XRP trading volume,"" the complaint said.      Further, the SEC alleged that Ripple paid at least 10 crypto trading platforms to list and trade XRP in 2017 and 2018. One platform received a 17-million XRP fee in 2017, the agency said in an example. Other exchanges received incentive fees. None of these platforms were registered with the SEC, though at least two are based in the U.S.    Political upheaval    The SEC’s lawsuit comes as the agency’s chief prepares to step down and the federal government undergoes a change in leadership. Chairman Jay Clayton previously announced he would leave his role at the end of the year, though a specific date has not been provided.      SEC Enforcement Director Stephanie Avakian, who created the commission’s cyber unit, likewise plans to leave her role by year-end. Avakian is quoted in a press release saying, “We allege that Ripple, Larsen, and Garlinghouse failed to register their ongoing offer and sale of billions of XRP to retail investors, which deprived potential purchasers of adequate disclosures about XRP and Ripple's business and other important long-standing protections that are fundamental to our robust public market system.”      This means incoming President Joe Biden may appoint an acting chair to oversee the commission while his nominee to run the agency for a full term makes their way through Congress.      Garlinghouse has previously donated to the Biden for President campaign, as well as to the former presidential campaign of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. In public statements, he’s indicated that he is waiting to see how the new administration might handle matters of crypto regulation.      “I am optimistic that will actually improve where things sit for the XRP community broadly,” he told CNN’s Julia Chatterley earlier this month, when asked whether Ripple had made a decision on whether it was relocating its headquarters outside of the U.S.      Prior to the presidential election, Garlinghouse raised the possibility that Ripple could leave for greener pastures due to the lack of clarity from the SEC about XRP’s legal status.

42385416,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB1rLj,1608666743,"An SEC Victory in Ripple Case Would Render XRP 'Untradeable,' Market Pros Say","UPDATE (Dec. 22, 22:45 UTC): Shortly after this article was published, the SEC officially filed its lawsuit.      UPDATE (Dec. 23, 02:00 UTC): Added statement from second exchange to halt trading in XRP.      The market for XRP could quickly dry up, causing prices to suffer, if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ultimately prevails in an expected lawsuit against Ripple Inc., analysts and traders said.      Ripple's chief executive officer, Brad Garlinghouse, warned Monday the SEC could file a lawsuit in the near future against his company over its sales of XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Following the news, XRP's price dropped sharply, losing as much as 14% before rebounding slightly.      While the case has yet to be filed, and could take years to resolve, some market experts warn that if the SEC proves in court that XRP is a security, the cryptocurrency could end up without an adequate market, all else being equal. That's because as of now the majority of crypto trading venues are not licensed to deal in securities.      ""Many cryptocurrency exchanges would be forced to delist it, so liquidity would dry up,"" said Ryan Watkins, a research analyst at Messari. XRP's price would ""crash hard"" in this scenario, he said.      Exchanges that continue listing XRP run the risk of being asked to register as securities exchanges by the SEC should the commission win its lawsuit. Otherwise, these exchanges might face penalties for allowing retail consumers to trade an unregistered security.      Already, two small exchanges, CrossTower and Beaxy, have delisted the cryptocurrency.      ""CrossTower's listing committee evaluates tokens along multiple dimensions,"" said Kristin Boggiano, president of the firm, which opened this year. ""One of the criteria is whether an asset is a security. Given the uncertainty regarding XRP's status, CrossTower has decided to delist XRP.""      Chicago-based Beaxy similarly halted trading, but is allowing withdrawals of XRP until further notice.      “The SEC and Ripple Labs have been debating XRP’s legal status for years. So the news of SEC charges against Ripple are not unexpected. That being said, Beaxy Exchange has an obligation to operate with regulatory compliance as a priority,"" said Beaxy’s head of operations, Naeem Master. The exchange said that if a court finds XRP is not a security, it would be open to resuming support for the asset.      While these two are small operations compared to Coinbase or Binance, its deliberations could foreshadow how these larger trading platforms view XRP.      CrossTower is a member of the Coinbase-led Crypto Rating Council, an organization launched last year to provide some clarity on which digital assets might resemble securities. The project assessed that XRP more closely resembles a security than a non-security, giving the asset a score of 4 out of 5 (5 being a clear security). The scores are not meant to serve as legal advice but represent member exchanges' views on certain digital assets. In addition to CrossTower, Bittrex and Kraken are members of the group.      Coinbase, Bitstamp and Binance US declined to comment. Kraken did not respond to a request for comment by press time.    Short, intermediate and long term    To be clear: Delisting would be an intermediate-term risk for XRP, but it's far from a fait accompli.      “Odds XRP gets delisted on the SEC developments are low. The news represents, in my opinion, short-term noise as far as price goes,"" said trader and analyst Alex Kruger. “I do think it should underperform for a while longer. Market participants are very concerned about the XRP-SEC news and possible delisting, and we've seen lots of top buyers.”      But John Willock, CEO of Tritum, a diversified crypto services provider, said that if XRP ends up being designated a security, ""it would very likely render the asset untradeable for most exchanges and industry participants. That immediate disappearance of a massive portion of market liquidity and participants would cause the asset to dump heavily in price.""      Among the current crop of crypto investors, ""very few people would want to hold and deal with the cost and complexity of owning and interacting with a security instrument,"" Willock added.      Jay Hao, CEO of Malta-based crypto exchange OKEx, agreed with that assessment.      ""It's likely we would see a sharp sell-off of XRP, leading to a decline in its price,"" he told CoinDesk. Hao did not respond by press time to a follow-up question about whether his exchange would delist XRP if it is designated a security.      While institutional investors have lately been dipping their toes into the crypto pond, those large players are generally focused on bitcoin and ether. The part of the crypto market that includes XRP is still dominated by individual investors, according to experts who spoke to CoinDesk. If exchanges stop supporting XRP, retail investors would have no way to trade it.    Silver lining?    Nevertheless, the damage would not necessarily be fatal for XRP.      ""There are various ways the SEC could grant special operating conditions, or accept a payment of a settlement from Ripple that could dampen the blow,"" Willock said.      Hao similarly said that declaring XRP a security could potentially have a positive impact on the cryptocurrency's value down the line.      ""This call could eventually allow Ripple to list on traditional stock exchanges and potentially open it up to a far wider market, which means that there could be extremely positive price action in the long term,"" Hao said.      XRP was developed and launched in 2012 by Ripple Labs co-founders Arthur Britto and Jed McCaleb and tech whiz David Schwartz, who gifted a large portion of the token to the startup. The company has sold about $1.2 billion in XRP since then, according to Messari.      Ripple, which has long insisted it did not create and does not control XRP, did not respond to a request for comment by press time. In an appearance on CNBC Tuesday, Garlinghouse called the SEC's position on XRP ""one foot out the door.""      ""Not a single other country anywhere has looked at XRP as a security,"" he said. ""You've had countries like the U.K. and Japan and Switzerland and Singapore all come out and say things that make it clear that XRP is a currency.""      Garlinghouse also told viewers the token's fate was independent of his company's.      ""If Ripple the company didn't exist, XRP would still thrive around the globe with ... a couple hundred exchanges around the world,"" he said. ""And there's over 100 different projects, innovative entrepreneurs here in the U.S. and around the world building on top of XRP.""

The total loss in terms of dollar value is still being calculated, the exchange told CoinDesk Tuesday.  EXMO said, after analyzing logs for the affected servers, it is ""assuming"" the attacker had access to some of its the private keys and that it's trying to find out how this was possible.  EXMO saw losses in six cryptocurrencies out of 57 supported: bitcoin, XRP, tether, ether and ethereum classic. Each digital asset is hosted on its own server, the firm said.  Most of the stolen bitcoin was sent to an address that has accrued 306.99 BTC, worth around $7,206,200 at time of writing.  EXMO said it contacted cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex with a request to block an associated account and has also informed London police about the breach.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ordered ShipChain to cease and desist operations Monday and pay a $2.05 million penalty for violating securities laws in 2017. ShipChain, which had raised $27.6 million through its SHIP token initial coin offering (ICO), agreed to the penalty and quickly settled the suit.      ""The penalty represents substantially all of ShipChain's net assets,"" according to the order. ShipChain has further opted ""to cease all operations,"" the order said.      The development spells an end for a token project that's long tacked through stormy seas.      ShipChain had sought to build an automated ledger for international trade atop the Ethereum blockchain. It sold 145 million SHIP tokens to over 200 investors in late 2017 through early 2018. An early project whitepaper explained that proceeds would power research, development, marketing, legal – basically, all operations.      That caught the early ire of U.S. securities regulators. Shortly after the ICO wrapped up, South Carolina state securities regulators ordered ShipChain to cease operations. It alleged SHIP to be unregistered security in violation of state law. But ShipChain fought back. South Carolina ultimately vacated the case and the project sailed on.      The SEC action revives those charges and swiftly wraps them up. SHIP's buyers could reasonably expect a return on their investment deriving from ShipChain's business efforts, SEC argued. That's known as an investment contract – a security. Companies must register securities offerings with the SEC.      ShipChain never did.

42385414,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB1rHx,1608655749,Crypto Needs to Engage With the World,"It is no understatement that currently our global financial system is structurally unsound and unsustainable. This is primarily the result of how we approach money and banking: The highly centralized bank-debt structure of money, the way money is inevitably issued and distributed and the astonishing gap between financial and ecological flows raise significant questions about the status quo. Yet, what tangible alternatives are there to reinvent this system?      Over a decade on from its inception, cryptocurrency is still the most promising tool available to reboot the financial system. Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency space has revitalized political economics, spurred us to rethink the organization of people, institutions and the social contracts that enable markets to exist.    This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Ethan Buchman is CEO of Informal Systems and co-founder of Cosmos.    Cryptocurrency is still very much an experiment – a global community asking how we reinvent governance, finance and economics – but one tending towards a more sustainable society. This capacity for experimentation is important. But how do we move from socio-economic tinkering to a responsible, load-bearing infrastructure across the globe?      Although 2020 was a flagship year for the blockchain industry, it is still very much in an early adopters phase. To move forward, distributed ledger technologies (DLT) need to be integrated into local communities where they offer tangible benefits to citizens. We need to look beyond the casino like experiments of decentralized finance (DeFi) that currently only offer speculation and “get rich quick” schemes. The industry needs to engage with existing social and political institutions rather than playing lip service to bag-holders.      A greater focus on how DLT can benefit citizens at a local level will be key to the success of a healthy and revamped financial system in the long term. Soundness and sustainability are strongly associated with localism, with greater self-sufficiency in communities, shorter supply chains and more democratic decision making and ownership.      There have always been alternative localist financial services: mutual credit systems and credit unions, complementary currencies, time banks, lending circles and mutual aid. But historically they’ve struggled to scale. Scaling a financial system is a matter of scaling trust across communities. Blockchains and cryptocurrencies provide the most credible foundation yet for attacking this problem of formulating and scaling new money systems.    The industry needs to engage with existing social and political institutions rather than playing lip service to bag-holders.    Vast swathes of the existing financial system are currently being rebuilt on more transparent and accessible infrastructure. Access to financial opportunities like derivatives or contracts are now available to groups beyond Wall Street insiders. Now, anyone can write and access such opportunities on the Ethereum blockchain. However, in doing so we need to make sure that we do not repeat the failings of our existing financial infrastructure.      One of the central problems of our economy over the last few decades, was that it became hyper financialized. That meant value creation was completely abstracted from real world wealth and sustainability, while traders made money from crazy financial products without generating any real value for society. And as finance ate the world, value became synonymous with U.S. dollars.      This needs to change at a fundamental level. We need to build technology that allows structures to demonstrate real economic well-being, and improve quality of life by promoting innovative solutions that challenge mainstream thinking on economic, environmental and social issues.      See also: NLW – COVID-19 and the Mass Surveillance Machine, Feat. Maya Zehavi      As for blockchains, money is the killer app. Our goal with this technological revolution must be to evolve a more sound and sustainable international financial regime that bridges the gap from local to global money and back. We are in the very early days of this transformation.      We're working our way from simple, global cryptocurrencies to more application specific and local ones. Already the underpinnings of this system are coming together: Bitcoin is the definitive store of value of the 21st century. Ethereum is a materially transformative technology that has unleashed invaluable experimentation in political economics. Cosmos makes Ethereum's transformative tech more accessible through interoperable sovereignty, providing the philosophy and tools for building, operating and interoperating more local financial infrastructure.    Money is the killer app    Localism is necessary for both technical and social scalability. There will be many, many blockchains and cryptocurrencies. Together they will form an ""internet of blockchains"" with a dynamic topology. Chains and currencies will be created and destroyed, grown and shrunk, split and merged. Each chain or cryptocurrency represents a different community and set of values. They provide a mechanism for stakeholders to coordinate via an explicit state machine to scale trust across their communities, and compete with incumbent, centralized powers.      Global stablecoins and CBDCs are an important step in the right direction, but also a distraction. More important will be municipal and neighbourhood currencies tied directly to local sustenance and generated by local mutual credit reflecting real trade. Projects like Grassroots Economics are most inspiring in that regard, but others like Circles and Union Protocol also seem to be on the right track.      As we witness the latest exciting proliferation of new blockchain platforms, applications and bullish sentiment, we must not lose sight of the end goal and keep on track to building a fair and sustainable financial system for citizens across the globe.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Ethan Buchman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/22/crypto-needs-to-engage-with-the-world,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/855548a03e2bd57aed50b3f9bc8430182a8fc866-1420x916.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42385404,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB1r7t,1608655501,Why Argentines Are Turning From Dollars to Stablecoins Like DAI,"In Argentina, the U.S. dollar has long been the most wanted foreign currency. But these days people can’t stop talking about DAI, a stablecoin issued by MakerDAO. DAI’s volume has already grown at least six-fold this year, according to information provided by local crypto exchanges SatoshiTango, Decrypto and Ripio.      Argentines, faced with a devaluation of the peso from $0.02 to $0.006 in just 18 months and an annual inflation rate higher than 30%, are looking for ways to safeguard their value. But as they are only permitted to buy up to $200 a month in dollars through official channels – with an additional tax of 65% over the official quote – some Argentines are turning to stablecoins like DAI.    Lea este artículo en español.    ""The adoption of DAI became popular because, being a stablecoin and having a quotation linked to the U.S. dollar, many Argentines have decided to acquire it as an indirect form of dollarization,"" crypto exchange Buenbit stated in an email sent to Coindesk.      This is all taking place amid an overall crypto boom in Argentina, with crypto exchanges enjoying record growth this year. Sebastian Serrano, CEO of Argentinian crypto exchange Ripio, told CoinDesk the exchange’s stablecoin trading volume grew 20 times in 2020. ""This is increasing month by month due to a local need for dollarization and a bullish crypto market promoting a higher adoption. It is a perfect storm,"" he stated.      Argentines' obsession with U.S. dollars has grown stronger in recent decades, mainly driven by high inflationary processes that pulverized the peso value. ""We have a relationship with the dollar that is typical of 70 years without a strong local currency. DAI is an alternative to the dollar,"" said Matias Bari, CEO of SatoshiTango, an exchange firm that started offering that stablecoin in 2020 and increased by seven its business in Argentina during this year.      DAI, a decentralized cryptocurrency built on Ethereum that is stabilized to the value of U.S. dollar (USD), is pegged 1:1 to this currency via what is known as the Maker (MKR) Dai Stablecoin System. The cryptocurrency collateral, viewed publicly on the Ethereum blockchain, keeps DAI’s value stable, unlike other popular stablecoins whose value is backed directly by USD.      Although many stablecoins have grown in Argentina, DAI has been a star in the local market. And that success, according to important crypto players such as Serrano, from Ripio, and Bari, from SatoshiTango, is partially explained by the early relationship that MakerDAO built with the Latin American crypto ecosystem in 2018.      Buenbit started offering DAI in November 2018, when Ripio also included that stablecoin, while it added USDC in August of this year. SatoshiTango, for its part, first made DAI available in March and then incorporated USDC in August.      Mariano Di Pietrantonio, senior marketing manager and community lead for the Maker Foundation, the foundation behind DAI, says, “This world was always closer to trading and short-term speculation. But we positioned DAI as a saving tool, a more down-to-earth proposal.”      In Argentina, crypto exchange Bitso recorded a trading volume of 2.3 million DAI during November, while its Mexican business, where the company holds 10 times more clients, counted 883,215 DAI during the same month, according to information published by the company.      ""It is a phenomenon,"" said Bitso Alpha Director Eduardo Arenas, who added that Argentina has a much higher sophistication in crypto than any other Latin American country, which helps local people to digest more easily what DAI is about.    A green obsession    According to Iván Tello, co-founder of the crypto exchange Decrypto, Argentines started buying DAI with pesos and then immediately exchanged them into dollars to save the money in their houses. That type of saving is known in Argentina as colchón – the Spanish word for mattress – by referring to a common place where they keep bills. However, over this year, users began to leave their DAI in exchanges, said Tello. ""The economic crisis in Argentina led Argentines to trust the crypto system and to mistrust the traditional system,” he added.      Argentines have reasons to distrust the traditional system – in 2001, through a process known as “corralito”, dollar accounts were frozen and part of the money was returned, in local pesos, after a strong devaluation. Not surprisingly, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Consensus of the Argentine Republic (INDEC), of the $228 billion that locals keep in foreign currency, only 8% is banked.      Purchases of DAI and other cryptocurrencies occur most strongly during the first 10 days of each month, when Argentines collect their salaries in pesos and seek to dollarize their incomes as soon as possible, Tello said. DAI transactions in Decrypto, whether purchases or sales, usually fluctuate between $200 and $400, according to private information provided by the company.      Individuals are not the only ones interested in DAI. Manuel Calderon, partner at financial and crypto consulting firm Beex, said in an interview he is receiving a higher quantity of inquiries from companies seeking to enter the DAI ecosystem, given the constant obstacles to acquiring dollars in the official market. Many questions come particularly from small and medium-sized firms looking for a reserve of value for their surpluses and needing to execute payments abroad.      However, it is more common for companies and funds to use other stablecoins instead of DAI. Ripio tends to operate USDC among institutional clients and investment funds. ""For a company, the profile of this coin is more pleasant from an institutional point of view, and is easier to explain,"" Serrano said. At Decrypto, companies usually use USDT for transactions between $5,000 and $10,000, Tello said.      Read more: Crypto Is Booming in Economically Challenged Argentina      In Argentina, the price of DAI is close to different dollar quotations – some belonging to the black market – that emerged after the financial restrictions imposed in 2019. These informal quotations are currently higher than the government’s official rate. One of them, of a legal nature, is known as a “stock exchange dollar” – dolar bolsa, in Spanish – which allows certain bonds to be purchased in Argentine pesos and sold for U.S. dollars abroad. However, the most famous quotation is called the “blue dollar,” commonly traded in illegal exchange offices known as “caves” and usually hidden behind traditional businesses such as jewelry stores.      According to Di Pietrantonio, although DAI’s quote is close to these unofficial rates, its price does not depend on them. ""A good mass of DAI at a local level makes the price competitive,"" he said.      Mariano Conti, former head of smart contracts at MakerDAO, explained in a 2019 talk how he received payments of DAI for his work.      Conti said he started getting paid in bitcoin to escape Argentinian capital controls in 2014. He discovered the Ethereum network in 2015. When he joined MakerDAO in 2016, he started receiving DAI. “I have never bought crypto with fiat in my entire life. I have only earned it,” he stated in that talk.      The programmer said that once a month he used to exchange the minimum amount of DAI for Argentine pesos to pay his expenses, but the rest was left in DAI. Although he acknowledged the risks of platforms and smart contracts, he preferred to trust those ecosystems before giving his money to the local government.      “DAI has implications and good properties that our local currencies at least now do not have and may never have,” Conti said.",POSITIVE,MKR | DAI,EXCHANGE | MARKET | MKR | TRADING | DAI,Andrés Engler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/22/why-argentines-are-turning-from-dollars-to-stablecoins-like-dai,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/51634166c6f1dc316be6de8f87e0dd0cb2babe30-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Read this article in English.    “La adopción de DAI se hizo muy popular porque, siendo una moneda estable y teniendo una cotización atada al dólar estadounidense, muchos argentinos han decidido adquirirla como una forma indirecta de dolarización”, explicó el exchange Buenbit en un correo electrónico enviado a CoinDesk.      Este fenómeno está teniendo lugar en medio de un boom general de criptomonedas en Argentina, en el que los exchanges han registrado un crecimiento récord durante este año. Sebastián Serrano, CEO del exchange argentino Ripio, le dijo a CoinDesk que su volumen de trading de stablecoins creció 20 veces en 2020. “Esto está creciendo mes a mes por la necesidad local de dolarización y un prometedor mercado cripto que genera una mayor adopción. Es una tormenta perfecta”, dijo.      La obsesión de los argentinos con el dólar se ha hecho más fuerte en décadas recientes, principalmente provocada por procesos de alta inflación que pulverizaron el valor del peso. “Tenemos una relación con el dólar que es típica de haber estado 70 años sin una moneda local fuerte”, dijo Matias Bari, CEO de SatoshiTango, un exchange que comenzó a ofrecer stablecoins en 2020 y que incrementó siete veces su negocio en Argentina durante este año.      DAI, una criptomoneda descentralizada creada sobre Ethereum y estabilizada al valor del dólar estadounidense, está atada 1 a 1 al valor de esa moneda mediante lo que es conocido como el Maker (MKR) Dai Stablecoin System. Su colateral, visto públicamente en la blockchain de Ethereum, mantiene estable el valor de DAI, a diferencia de otras criptomonedas estables cuyos valores están directamente sostenidos por dólares.      A pesar de que muchas criptomonedas han crecido en Argentina, DAI ha sido la estrella en ese mercado. Y ese suceso, de acuerdo a importantes jugadores de la escena cripto local como Serrano – de Ripio, y Bari – de SatoshiTango, está parcialmente explicado por la temprana relación que MakerDAO tejió con el ecosistema cripto de América Latina desde 2018.      Buenbit comenzó a ofrecer DAI en noviembre de ese año, mes en el que Ripio también incluyó esa stablecoin, mientras que esta última compañía añadió USDC en agosto de 2020. SatoshiTango, por su parte, primero puso a disposición DAI en marzo y más tarde incorporó USDC, en agosto.      Mariano Di Pietrantonio, senior marketing manager y líder de comunidad de Maker Foundation, la fundación que está detrás de DAI, dijo: ""Ese mundo siempre estuvo más cerca del trading y la especulación de corto plazo. Pero nosotros posicionamos a DAI como una herramienta de ahorro, como una propuesta más bajada a tierra”.      En Argentina, el exchange Bitso reportó un volumen de trading de 2,3 millones de DAI durante noviembre, mientras que su negocio en México, donde la compañía posee diez veces más de clientes, informó 883.215 DAI durante ese mismo período, de acuerdo a información publicada por la compañía.      “Esto es un fenómeno”, dijo el director de Bitso Alpha, Eduardo Arenas, quien agregó que Argentina tiene una sofisticación en cripto mucho más alta que cualquier otro país de América Latina, lo que ayuda a los argentinos a digerir de manera más sencilla de qué se trata DAI.    Una verde obsesión    De acuerdo a Iván Tello, cofundador del exchange Decrypto, los argentinos primero compraban DAI con pesos para inmediatamente cambiarlos por dólares y guardarlos físicamente en sus casas, en un mecanismo de ahorro conocido en el país como “colchón”, al referirse a un lugar común para atesorar los billetes. No obstante, en el transcurso de este año, los usuarios comenzaron a dejar sus DAI en los exchanges, dijo Tello. “La crisis económica en Argentina los llevó a confiar en el sistema cripto y a desconfiar del sistema tradicional”, agregó.      Los argentinos tienen razones para desconfiar del sistema tradicional: en 2001, en un proceso conocido como “corralito”, las cuentas en dólares fueron congeladas y parte del dinero fue devuelto, en pesos, después de una fuerte devaluación. No es sorprendente que, de acuerdo al Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Censos (Indec), de los $228.000 millones que los locales tienen en moneda extranjera, sólo el 8% se encuentre bancarizado.      Las compras de DAI y otras criptomonedas ocurren de manera más pronunciada durante los primeros diez días de cada mes, cuando los argentinos cobran sus salarios en pesos y buscan dolarizar sus ingresos lo antes posible, dijo Tello. Las transacciones de DAI en Decrpyto, ya sean compras o ventas, usualmente fluctúan entre los $200 y $400, de acuerdo a información provista por la compañía.      Los individuos no son los únicos interesados en DAI. Manuel Calderon, Partner de la consultora en finanzas y cripto Beex, dijo en una entrevista que está recibiendo una mayor cantidad de consultas de empresas intentando entrar al ecosistema de DAI por los constantes obstáculos para adquirir dólares en el mercado oficial. Muchas preguntas llegan particularmente desde pequeñas y medianas empresas interesadas en encontrar una reserva de valor para sus excedentes y en ejecutar pagos en el exterior.      No obstante, es más común para las compañías y fondos usar otras criptomonedas estables en lugar de DAI. Ripio tiende a operar USDC entre sus clientes institucionales y fondos de inversión. “Para una empresa, el perfil de esta moneda es más agradable desde un punto de vista institucional, y es más sencilla de explicar”, dijo Serrano. En Decrpyto, las firmas usualmente utilizan USDT para transacciones de entre $5000 y $10.000, dijo Tello.      Lee mas: Las criptomonedas crecen en la problemática economía de Argentina      En Argentina, el precio de DAI es cercano a diferentes cotizaciones no oficiales del dólar que emergieron después de las restricciones impuestas en 2019, algunas de las cuales son ilegales. Todas ellas son actualmente más altas que la oficial del gobierno. Una, de carácter legal, es conocida como “dólar bolsa”, que permite adquirir ciertos bonos con pesos argentinos y venderlos en dólares estadounidenses en el exterior. De todas maneras, la cotización más conocida es llamada “dólar blue”, comúnmente negociada en oficinas de cambio ilegales conocidas como “cuevas”, usualmente escondidas detrás de negocios tradicionales como joyerías.      De acuerdo a Di Pietrantonio, a pesar de que el precio de DAI esté cercano a estas cotizaciones no oficiales, su valor no depende de ellas. “Una buena masa de DAI a nivel local hace que el precio sea competitivo”, dijo.      Mariano Conti, exlíder de Smart Contracts en MakerDAO, explicó en una charla de 2019 cómo recibía DAI por su trabajo.      Dijo que comenzó aceptando pagos en Bitcoin para escapar de los controles de capitales que regían en Argentina durante 2014. Descubrió Ethereum un año después y cuando se unió a MakerDAO, en 2016, empezó a recibir DAI. “Nunca adquirí criptomonedas con fiat en mi vida. Solo las he recibido”, afirmó en esa charla.      El programador contó que una vez al mes convertía a pesos argentinos la cantidad necesaria para pagar sus gastos, mientras el resto quedaba en DAI. Y, a pesar de que era consciente de los riesgos de la plataforma y de los smart contracts, prefería confiar en esos ecosistemas antes de darle su dinero al gobierno argentino.      “DAI tiene implicaciones y buenas propiedades que nuestras monedas hasta el momento no tuvieron y probablemente nunca tengan”, dijo.",POSITIVE,MKR | DAI,ETH | EXCHANGE | MKR | TRADING | DAI,Andrés Engler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/22/los-argentinos-estan-cambiando-su-obsesion-historica-con-el-dolar-por-dai,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/51634166c6f1dc316be6de8f87e0dd0cb2babe30-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433406,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQfPh,1608653128,Polkadot-Based DeFi Insurance App Raises $1.95M Led by KR1,"Insurance startup Tidal Finance has raised a $1.95 million seed round for its TIDAL token, led by European digital asset company KR1.      New York-based Tidal will use the Polkadot blockchain to allow users to contribute funds that insure a set of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications against smart-contract failure or breaches in one pool, theoretically improving the capital efficiency for DeFi investors interested in insurance. Other participants in the round included NGC Ventures, Kenetic Capital, Genesis Block and others.      The pioneer in protocol insurance is Ethereum-based Nexus Mutual, which funded itself with a token sale and paid out its first claim in February, following the first round of attacks on bZx, the flash loan provider.      Tidal believes there are refinements that can be made on the model, however, and that there will be advantages in building it on an up-and-coming layer-one blockchain.    Why Polkadot?    In the works since early this year, the company detailed its project on Medium in October. CEO and founder Chad Liu said the team chose Polkadot because it should eventually allow for more sources of liquidity to provide insurance, therefore attracting more people to buy insurance.      ""The Polkadot network will connect more chains when it becomes mature. It's a bigger addressable market,"" Liu said.      Polkadot's lower gas prices will also help users, particularly if some pools eventually require more frequent payments in order to reflect changes in variable rates.      Notably, applications do not need to be on Polkadot to be insured by Tidal. In fact, it's likely that many of the first applications covered will be on Ethereum, since that's where basically all of DeFi runs for now. That said, if a well-resourced EOS holder wanted to draw insurance premiums, Tidal's team believes they might be more likely to deposit on a Polkadot-based application, once it connects to EOS, simply due to lower friction.      Tidal sees this as its chief innovation: liquidity providers backing insurance will protect multiple applications in one pool (rather than each liquidity provider insuring one application at a time, as on the earlier projects).      At launch, Tidal expects to provide three different pools – low, moderate and high risk – with as many as 20 applications in lower-risk pools.    Pool approach    Backing pools of assets rather than one at a time enhances the capital efficiency, Liu said, allowing backers to earn premiums from many applications at once.      The TIDAL token will earn a portion of the fee charged when people originate cover and it will also serve as a governance token for the application. Insurance premiums will go to liquidity providers in Tidal's pools.      Liu said there will be a fixed supply of 20 billion TIDAL tokens.      The details of the token-economies are still somewhat limited, but a distribution breakdown shared with CoinDesk showed that about 12% was designated for the token sale, 10% for the team, 12% for a liquidity mining program (the website indicates this would be a reward for those who fund insurance pools) and 39% for staking rewards (no details on this have been released). The rest is divided up between reserve, treasury and ecosystem.      Tidal estimates that the first insurance pools will go live in the first quarter of 2021.

NFTs are little bits of code that extend the fundamental innovation of hard-capped supply, self-custody and censorship-resistance to all digital assets, not just to money. This is vital. NFTs enable any unique asset or item to be tracked and traded with all the same freedoms as its fungible token counterpart. While this asset class is still nascent, the potential is utterly astounding.    This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Robbie Ferguson is the co-founder of Immutable, makers of ""Gods Unchained,"" a digital trading card game.    Take the $100 billion video game items industry. In the last three years alone, we’ve seen nine figures in venture capital invested in blockchain companies competing for its disruption. Other NFT verticals are quickly emerging. In 2020, there was an explosion of digital art and tokenized custody startups: everything from sneakers to Cézanne to Saint Laurent are now being wrapped up, sold and traded as unique and individual NFTs.      The power of NFT ownership isn’t limited to gaming or art. Any illiquid or unique asset globally could benefit from this technological standard. Financial assets? Check. Commodities like diamonds? Check. The 3% timeshare of a boat you bought, have regretted ever since and can’t find a buyer for? You bet. The total addressable market is, quite literally, in the trillions.      NFTs are a rapidly emerging asset class with an Achilles heel: scalability. Like most other cryptographic tools, NFTs greatest weakness comes from the code's deployment in the real world. Limited transaction throughput, high transaction fees and slow transaction time are all muting this immutable technology's revolution.      Different blockchains are doggedly fighting to solve this issue and establish themselves as the home of unique digital assets. But the wrong choice will hand the reins of this future to a centralized and insecure solution, destroying the possibility of a truly community owned future.    The battle over ownership    Everyone wants to own the network and users on which NFTs live and trade. It’s a big pie, and there are lots of people who want a slice. But the pie doesn't scale.      Trading an NFT is insanely more expensive than an ordinary fungible token. If you trade a million ERC-20s, it costs the same as trading one, while a million NFT trades will cost you a million times more. These scarce digital assets are also inherently illiquid, because every NFT is an individual order-book. If there are 15 million gods unchained cards out there, there’s 15 million individual markets, each with their own bids and asks.    Everything from sneakers to Cézanne to Saint Laurent are now being wrapped up, sold and traded as unique and individual NFTs.    Better tech will provide better scalability and liquidity without requiring trade-offs in decentralization or security. A swathe of layer 1 and layer 2 solutions are all scrambling to upgrade their tech to lay claim as the default home of NFTs.    So, who’s in the running?  VC-backed layer 1s    Over the past year we’ve seen many “ETH-killers” come to the party, and many of them have impressive-sounding tech and hundreds of millions in savvy VC funding. New blockchains like Flow and TRON have publicly claimed they want to be the home of all NFTs or gaming and have built up handsome IP partnerships to do so.      See also: Ready Layer One: Base Layer Protocols Team for Virtual Developer Event      Their weaponry? In the end, the blockchain trilemma still applies: the only fundamental scaling boosts come from a reduction in security, decentralization or both. While this is always an individual decision, it’s imperative users know what they’re trading off.    The emperor’s new sidechains    Sidechains are trying to operate on existing L1s (predominantly Ethereum) in order to provide a low-security scalability option to NFTs. Namely Matic, Ronin, xDai.However, these scaling solutions are fundamentally achieving this throughput by removing the security and decentralization properties that are necessary to support highly valuable assets. What’s the point?    Rollup: Immutable X and Optimism    It wouldn’t be an op-ed without an opinion, and thankfully, mine is shared by someone much smarter than me.    “In the short term, I just don’t see rollups as being one choice among many things; I see them as being the only choice.”Vitalik Buterin    Thanks, Vitalik.    Pens over swords    Today’s wars aren’t fought with force, they’re fought with information. Token holders and expensive PR campaigns evangelize their chosen champion’s tech with a religious and one-eyed zeal. Anonymous personalities on Twitter become overnight thought leaders (and sometimes stick around long enough to see their predictions validated).      But this marketing comes at a cost: Users have to know what deals they’re giving away when they use a piece of technology. We are at dire risk of letting the future of digital asset ownership, NFTs, be run by a centralized operator, a VC-owned blockchain or fundamentally insecure tech.      See also: Stocking Stuffers: Bid on 12 of Crypto’s ‘Most Influential’ NFTs      If we’re serious about getting major league developers and financial institutions to consider NFTs, it’s not enough to just make a high frequency marketplace. The future home for NFTs needs to be secure and censorship-resistant at its core, like Ethereum is today, and be able to securely support a billion dollar item economy.      Over the past six months, so-called “Eth killers” have announced their intention to draw liquidity to other chains for NFTs. Right now, crypto-developers, gamers and artists are actively being marketed to leave Ethereum. But the moment is even more critical than that. Whoever wins the NFT blockchain wars will become the default network of all future gaming, entertainment and collectible applications.

42433413,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQffh,1608648459,"Druckenmiller, Jones and Bitcoin’s Perfect Trading Machine","No group of speculators was more notorious in the 1980s and 1990s than Stanley Druckenmiller, Paul Tudor Jones and George Soros. Druckenmiller famously bet $2 billion on the Deutsche mark when the Berlin Wall came down. Soros and Druckeniller together made billions betting against the British pound when its peg collapsed in 1992. And Jones profited from the 1987 stock market crash.      In 2020, two of these three traders – Druckenmiller and Jones – finally began to buy bitcoins.    This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and is a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.    One wonders what took them so long. The world has never seen a purer trading machine than Bitcoin. It was purpose-built to let professional speculators like Druckenmiller and Jones rapidly make, or lose, large amounts of money.      A look back at the 1987 stock market crash, probably the single craziest day in market history, provides a window into the thinking of these three speculators. It also hints at why, 33 years later, they’ve finally had their bitcoin conversion.    'One of the most exciting periods of my life'    To help guide his trading decisions in 1986, 33-year old hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones turned to the 1920s for inspiration. He did so by constructing an “analog model,” a simple visual overlay of the 1980s market over the 1920s market.      Jones mentions this analog model in an infamous documentary about him, ""Trader."" He has reportedly tried to have ""Trader"" quashed many times over his career.      Jones's analog model suggested to him that the 1980s market would at some point collapse, much like it had in 1929. And so Jones' hedge fund was heavily short the stock market (i.e., positioned to gain from a fall) going into Oct. 19, 1987, or ""Black Monday."" Jones has described the week of the crash as ""one of the most exciting periods of my life.""    Speculators are less concerned about reality, or the fundamentals, and care more about what is going on in people's heads.    Druckenmiller also has a war story about the 1987 crash. On the afternoon of Oct. 16 – the Friday before ""Black Monday'' – Druckenmiller remembers walking over to George Soros' office. At the time, Druckenmiller, then 34 and managing his own hedge fund, was heavily invested in the stock market. Soros happened to pull out a copy of Jones' analog model from a month or two earlier.      After absorbing the implications of Jones’ chart, Druckenmiller recalls being ""sick to my stomach when I went home that evening. I realized that I had blown it and that the market was about to crash.""      When markets opened that Monday, 200 points lower than Friday's close, Druckenmiller sold his entire position and even managed to go short. The Dow would end up falling 508 points that day, or 22.6%, the largest one day decline in history.      Soros also lost money in the 1987 crash. ""I was as badly caught as the next fellow. I was convinced the crash would start in Japan; that turned out to be an expensive mistake.""    Over 1% of my assets in bitcoin    Fast forward to 2020 and one wonders if Druckenmiller and Jones haven't been exchanging trading ideas again. In May, Jones announced on CNBC that he has “just over 1% of my assets in bitcoin. Maybe it’s almost 2[%]. That seems like the right number right now.” In October, Jones noted that ""I like bitcoin even more now than I did then.""      In November, Druckenmiller admitted to owning a ""tiny bit of it."" He went on to say that bitcoin has ""a lot of attraction as a store of value to both millennials and the new West Coast money and, as you know, they have a lot of it.""      See also: Legendary Investor Stan Druckenmiller Turns Bitcoin Bull (podcast)      Soros, for his part, has been mum on the question of whether he owns bitcoin.      Some people are surprised legendary speculators like Druckenmmiller and Jones are jumping into a relatively untried instrument. I'm shocked that it took them this long.    Keynesian beauty contests    Market participants like Soros, Druckenmiller and Jones are not investors. Investors evaluate a firm's future cash flows in an effort to determine if its shares are underpriced.      Speculators are less concerned about reality or the fundamentals and care more about what is going on in people's heads. If they can figure out ahead of time what others are going to do they can buy (or sell) ahead of time and later unload on their targets at a much better price.      Jones’ strategy in 1987 was a great example of speculation. He used the analog model to try and gauge the psychology of the markets, positioning himself to profit from others’ panic.    Like beauty in Keynes’ contest, the price of bitcoin is purely a function of the market’s imagination.    The famous economist John Maynard Keynes once described speculation as akin to a beauty contest. Presented with a row of faces in a newspaper, competitors must pick not the face they find the most beautiful, but the one they believe other participants will find the prettiest. A deeply nested mind game emerges in which we “devote our intelligences to anticipating what average opinion expects the average opinion to be,” wrote Keynes. “And there are some, I believe, who practice the fourth, fifth and higher degrees.""      Playing the game to the fifth degree is what Paul Tudor Jones did in 1987. But in 2020, Jones has finally discovered the purest speculative instrument to ever trade on the face of the Earth.    No fundamentals    Equities or commodities have a beauty contest element to them, but they aren’t pure beauty contests. There is a set of fixed underlying fundamentals involved.      The price of oil, for instance, is battened down by the ability of industrial users to substitute away from oil into natural gas or some other alternative. As for equities, when a company's share price rises too high above its earnings potential, the company will issue shares, dampening the rise.      Not bitcoin. Like beauty in Keynes’ contest, the price of bitcoin is purely a function of the market’s imagination. That is, unlike the prices of the S&P 500 or a commodity like crude oil, there is no set of fundamentals that gets in the way of what bitcoin’s price can be. If enough people wake up in the morning thinking that the price of bitcoin should rise, and act on it, then it will rise.      This lack of fundamentals is why bitcoin demonstrates such incredibly fast and sustained price swings. It can double in a month, or rise by a factor of 10x in three months. Or it can fall 50% in a day.      See also: JP Koning - The Dark Future Where Payments Are Politicized and Bitcoin Wins      Big psychology-driven swings like these are the bread and butter of professional speculators like Druckenmiller and Jones. Both have proven adept at playing beauty contests, burrowing deep into peoples’ minds to anticipate what they will buy or sell in the future. That skill allows them to make huge amounts of money, very quickly. For them, bitcoin is the perfect trading machine.      Speculators often talk up their positions. That is, they mention on TV they happen to be investing in something, hoping that they can create a bandwagon effect. Don't confuse their words for true belief. Jones describes bitcoin as being in the “first inning.” But he’ll short bitcoin the moment the situation warrants it, much like how he shorted equities in 1987.      Speculators love to play the game.

""The market looks to begin a consolidation phase above $22,000,"" according to Matt Blom, head of sales and trading for the cryptocurrency firm Diginex. ""Further attempts to drive the market lower are likely to be met with firm support from the bulls.""      XRP (XRP), the digital asset used for payments, fell for a fourth straight day, down 17% over that stretch, after Brad Garlinghouse, CEO for San Francisco-based Ripple, said he had been informed by regulators that the company would be sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The coming suit is believed to relate to sale of XRP, and whether the tokens represent securities that needed to be registered with authorities. Ripple disputes the claim and argues that other branches of the U.S. government have deemed XRP to be a currency.      “It’s an attack on the entire crypto industry and American innovation,” Garlinghouse said in an emailed statement.

Oct. 9, 2020: Mati Greenspan, founder of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency analysis firm Quantum Economics, tells subscribers: “It’s a bit surreal to see gigantic corporate entities now going knee-deep in bitcoin.”      Oct. 22, 2020. Zac Prince, CEO of the crypto lender BlockFi, in an email: “This coalescing of fintech and bitcoin is yet another bullish development for investors.”      Oct. 23, 2020. JPMorgan analysts, in a report: ""Even a modest crowding out of gold as an alternative currency over the longer term would imply doubling or tripling of the bitcoin price from here.""      Nov. 9, 2020. Stanley Druckenmiller, hedge fund investing legend, in CNBC interview: ""Frankly, if the gold bet works, the bitcoin bet will probably work better.”      Nov. 10, 2020. Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy CEO, in interview: ""Ultimately you have to find something which you can’t print more of that doesn’t have its fundamental underpinnings tied to a fiat currency, and the only thing that I can find right now is bitcoin.”      Nov. 11, 2020. Ray Dalio, the founder and co-chairman of Bridgewater Associates, in interview with Yahoo Finance: “I don’t think digital currencies will succeed in the way people hope they would.”      Nov. 18, 2020. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, at New York Times DealBook conference: Bitcoin is ""not my cup of tea.""

Verge Currency announced Tuesday it has teamed up with a U.S.-based firm called Voice Life to develop a new mobile charging device that accepts verge (XVG) as payment.  The tech will be on display at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2021.  When launched, users will be able to use the VergePAY platform to fund a two-minute charge of mobile devices. XVG is the only cryptocurrency the system will use, a Verge representative told CoinDesk.  The system will use a Far-Field Wireless Power Charging System from Voice Life. This ""will ultimately convert ambient terahertz waves into storable energy,"" according to the firm's website.  Voice Life CEO Robert Smith said, ""The 'holy grail of blockchain technology' is going to be a real-time application that extends its utility beyond just improving financial transactions. We believe we are developing that application with Verge.""  Pornhub previously used verge as its only cryptocurrency option for performer payouts after PayPal withdrew its services from the company.

42433410,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQfZh,1608640969,Ford Finds Using Blockchain With Hybrid Vehicles Can Help Cut Air Pollution in Cities,"Vehicle-manufacturing giant Ford says new technologies such as blockchain and geofencing can be paired with plug-in hybrid-electric vehicles (PHEVs) to improve air quality in cities.    The company conducted a three-year study in the European cities of London, Cologne and Valencia on the ability of commercial PHEVs to help cities address air-quality challenges.  The dynamic geofencing feature used in the research activated zero-emission activity in the vehicles whenever they entered a low‑emissions zone, without intervention from the driver.  Ford also used blockchain technology to monitor the times a vehicle entered or left a geofenced zone, finding the paired technologies work well to improve urban air quality.  “As Ford’s connected PHEVs entered these constantly fluctuating zones, they automatically switched to low-emission mode – taking the decision making out of drivers’ hands, improving air quality for citizens and helping vehicles maintain compliance with local restrictions,” said Ford in a news release.  In parts of Europe, some cities have introduced low-emission zones where high-polluting vehicles are restricted from access. Hybrid vehicles are able to switch between electric and combustion motors, varying emissions outputs.

It also claimed her funds had been obtained by fraud, via Wright's involvement with the account.      Wright – who claims to be the inventor of Bitcoin – had had his account (which had been opened at the same time) closed after the firm found he had been accused of fraud, per the document. The exchange returned $10,000 he had deposited, however.      Reliantco had failed in early 2019 to have the case moved to Cyprus and claimed that Ang hadn't read the website's terms and conditions. This was dismissed by Judge Andrew Baker at the time.      Ang had claimed for $708,857, comprising of an initial investment placed in bitcoin futures of over US$400,000, as well as around $300,000 in gains on her open positions. She further claimed $600,000 in damages for gains she would have realized if the funds hadn't been withheld.      Additionally, Ang claimed a loss of $1,334,163 that would have come from a plan to open a bitcoin account at the Kraken exchange and earn 3,530 bitcoin cash arising from the cryptocurrency's fork from the bitcoin blockchain. All in, the claims came to $2,643,020.      Judge Butcher said that, while he found some of Ang's representations over Wright's access to her account ""inaccurate"" and ""untruthful,"" ""I have found that she opened it and was its principal user.""      Wright is also fighting a court case in the U.S. over billions in bitcoin that he claims to have mined in the early days of the cryptocurrency with former business partner, the late David Kleiman.      Edit (12:10 UTC, Dec. 22 2020): Corrected date of the judge's ruling.

42422899,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qoXh,1608636600,Why NFT Collector 'WhaleShark' Spent 22 ETH on These Sneakers,"The hype around sneakers has turned collectibles into investibles – fueled by a healthy appetite from “sneakerheads” and a lean supply of inventory from popular brands.  So when a startup put a one-of-a-kind high-top up for bid on the blockchain – both in digital and actual form – one whale took a bite and dropped 22 ETH (worth around $13,331 at time of sale) on a pair of AI-designed sneakers. And this was all streamed live on Twitch.  The pseudonymous buyer, who goes by the handle WhaleShark, is one of the largest collectors of art and digital-gaming non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in the industry. When he jumped into the bidding pool, it scared smaller fish out of the water.  Although he denied being a sneakerhead himself, WhaleShark told CoinDesk on a call that when he researched the world’s 17 most expensive pairs of sneakers, he found these shoes can be priced up to $50,000, primarily due to scarcity.  “So when I noticed there was going to be an NFT edition, they were pulling at my heartstrings,” he said. “I would love to hang that up on a mural or digital screen in my office.”  Not only will the $13,000 artwork hang on the wall of his office, WhaleShark will receive an exact copy of the shoe delivered to his door early next year.  The $13,000 sneaker  The shoe in question is named “The X Evolutions,” known by most as simply The X. The kicks – clearly inspired by the iconic Nike Dunk High – were created by Instagram-popular sneaker studio RTFKT (pronounced like “artifact”).  The X auction opened on Nov. 19 and lasted for 10 days on a new platform that RTFKT built. However, the shoe that bidders saw on the 19th was just a plain white high-top. As bids topped a certain amount of ETH, the design would change – a splash of paint at a time.  “The reason I was bidding was because I wanted to see how the design evolved,” WhaleShark said.  No one knew what the shoe would look like at its 10th and final “evolution,” and that remains a mystery: The winning 22 ETH was only good enough for the sixth evolution. The final evolution was set at a threshold of 58 ETH.  “For us, it really wasn’t the best timing,” RTFKT co-founder and CEO Steven Vasilev told CoinDesk. “We saw with the recent bitcoin boom and ETH climbing on all the platforms that bidding has really slowed down.”  More recently, however, things have picked back up. Flashy NFT auctions are everywhere. Canadian DJ Deadmau5 sold a piece of his NFT collection, RAREZ, for 78 ETH (roughly $50,000) on SuperRare last week. Famous rappers are getting in on the NFT act.  Why sneakers?  This was not the first digital sneaker project by RTFKT. Earlier this year, the team sold its first piece on NFT marketplace SuperRare designed after the Tesla Cybertruck for 30 ETH. The bidding went up to 65 ETH until the bidder realized the photo he saw of Elon Musk wearing the “Cybersneaker” was photoshopped.  Investor Richard Kim, a partner at Galaxy Digital, told CoinDesk that this type of “oh s**t” moment “was a great example of a metaverse where things become so blurred you have to ask which reality was real.”  The market for real sneakers has become a real force in recent years. The global resale market is projected to reach $30 billion by 2030, according to Cowen Equity Research, which classified sneakers as an alternative asset class.  What was different about RTFKT's latest shoe was that it seemed perfect for enticing both NFT early-adopters and IRL sneakerheads. Having a physical pair involved in the deal made the “virtual flex” of winning even better, WhaleShark said.  “I kept bidding until I saw it reach a point where I thought I could definitely rock them on foot, although I was disappointed it didn’t reach level 10,” he said.  Physical and digital ownership  “We want to be the segue to NFTs by having a mix of physicals and digital items to get people’s feet wet a little bit,” said RTFKT co-founder Chris Le. “Down the road, we can turn off sending physicals and go completely digital maybe when AR or VR is mainstream.”  RTFKT’s co-founders told CoinDesk they believe the future of ownership is going to be mainly focused around unique virtual items, and the physical utility of them.  A digital sneaker can be used as a filter to create content, that only the person who bought it can access, Vasilev said. “On top of that, the ability to redeem a physical item also keeps the old sneakerheads happy. It’s the best of both worlds.”  Sam Englebardt, partner at Galaxy Digital, told CoinDesk in an interview that his investment firm’s thesis for NFTs is that digital objects can enhance the experience of physically-worn luxury items. Galaxy’s $1 million investment in RTFKT in December 2019 was the perfect opportunity to test the hypothesis.  “They’re innovative around the design and release of the sneaker as a physical product,” Englebardt said. “You are acquiring all the status that comes with that purchase.”",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | AR,Doreen Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/12/22/why-nft-collector-whaleshark-spent-22-eth-on-these-sneakers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bf2545a95818f00287448b57b302100c71ef6c51-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433408,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQfVh,1608627326,Huobi Crypto Exchange Returning to US After Winning Nevada Trust License,"Global crypto exchange Huobi Group is making its U.S. comeback after an abrupt departure over a year ago.      Huobi Tech – a Hong Kong-based publicly traded company acquired by Huobi Group founder and CEO Leon Li via a reverse takeover in 2018 – said a trust license has been approved by the Nevada Financial Institutions Division for its wholly owned subsidiary, the Huobi Trust Company, according to its Tuesday filing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.      The license will enable the company to offer custodial and compliance services in the U.S. market early in 2021. The move is part of Huobi Group’s efforts to launch regulated financial products and services in the states.      Huobi US (HBUS), another legal entity related to Huobi Group, ceased its operations in December 2019 citing regulatory concerns. The company said at the time the departure was meant to be the next step in making its businesses more compliant with U.S. laws and regulations.      The Seychelles-based exchange has since been evaluating different ways to reenter the U.S. market. In April, Huobi Group global head Ciara Sun previously said the exchange might team up with a fully regulated brokerage in the U.S. to operate its businesses across the country.      ""The Huobi brand is committed to bringing users a wide range of safe and secure digital asset products and services, whether directly from Huobi Group or indirectly through partners like Huobi Trust Company,"" Sun said of the Huobi Trust Company.      The Nevada-based Huobi Trust Company will be led by its chief trust officer, Simon Collier, who served as contract project director and global head of wealth solutions at HSBC in Hong Kong for more than seven years, according to a press statement shared with CoinDesk.      Aja Heise, who was formerly the chief compliance officer at Prime Trust, will lead the trust company’s compliance program. She has experience in designing Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) programs for digital asset projects.      “The announcement is a key step forward in the company’s ambitious plans to expand its recognized brand and products to a global audience, as well as its ongoing initiative to establish a suite of regulated financial products and services in the blockchain space,” Huobi Tech said.      See also: Huobi Launches Crypto Saving Products to Compete With DeFi Yield Farming      The move comes at a time when the U.S. regulators, including the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are imposing stricter scrutiny over international crypto exchanges that run businesses in the country.      Many global crypto exchanges still face difficulties in acquiring licenses from state regulators in the U.S., especially for their fiat-crypto trading businesses.      HUBS received licenses in 43 of 50 states, but a number of them allowed the exchange to do only crypto-to-crypto trading, not crypto-to-fiat, according to an old FAQ page on HBUS’ website.

Coinbase noted the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), part of the U.S. Treasury, asked for comments on 24 questions, each requiring detailed analysis and extensive cost assessments.  ""Addressing all of the questions FinCEN has posed and the additional issues FinCEN has not yet considered would take much longer than 15 days in the best of times,"" Coinbase said in its letter. ""To do so in a handful of working days across the national holidays and during the latest surge in [COVID-19] is quite obviously impossible.""  Under the advanced notice of proposed rulemaking announced last week, users who want to send cryptocurrencies from centralized exchanges to a private wallet would need to provide personal information about the owner of that wallet to the exchanges, if the amount sent is greater than $10,000 in one day.  The exchanges would also need to submit and store records involving such transactions with a total value over $10,000 in a 24-hour period, and maintain records for transactions over $3,000.  The general public will have until Jan. 4, 2021, to provide comments or feedback (although another part of the document says feedback can be submitted within 15 days after the rule is published in the Federal Register, the national logbook, on Dec. 23).  While 60 days of comment is the norm for such proposals, the Treasury Dept. cited ""significant national security imperatives"" for the shortened period.  Coinbase attributed a more mundane reason for the shortened review period: ""There is no emergency here; there is only an outgoing administration attempting to bypass the required consultation with the public to finalize a rushed rule before their time in office is done,"" the exchange said in its letter to the director of FinCEN.

42433415,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQfhh,1608599362,Ripple CEO Warns SEC May Sue Company Over XRP Sales,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) intends to sue Ripple over its sale of XRP, CEO Brad Garlinghouse said Monday.      According to Fortune, the lawsuit will be filed in the near future, though no specific date has been provided yet. The suit had not been filed as of press time. Ripple cofounder Chris Larsen and Garlinghouse will be named defendants alongside the firm, Garlinghouse said.      ""It’s an attack on the entire crypto industry and American innovation,"" Brad Garlinghouse said in an emailed statement.      In an emailed statement, outside counsel Michael Kellogg, of Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick said, ""This complaint is wrong as a matter of law. Other major branches of the U.S. government, including the Justice Department and the Treasury Department’s FinCen, have already determined that XRP is a currency. Transactions in XRP thus fall outside the scope of the federal securities laws. This is not the first time the SEC has tried to go beyond its statutory authority. The courts have corrected it before and will do so again.”      Ripple received word Monday that the SEC intended to sue, according to the Wall Street Journal.      Ripple is already being sued by XRP investors in a putative class-action lawsuit, on claims that the company said XRP's price would rise. That suit, which began in 2018, continues its course through the courts.      The company has previously paid $700,000 in fines on charges it violated aspects of the Bank Secrecy Act brought by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), as well as an additional $450,000 in fines to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California.      Garlinghouse's move Monday is reminiscent of how messaging platform Kik announced the SEC would file suit against it for raising $100 million to build Kin. Kik later settled the case.      Crypto company CEOs warning the broader industry of upcoming regulatory actions may be a bigger trend. Coinbase chief Brian Armstrong previewed potential U.S. Treasury Department rulemaking last month, weeks before FinCEN published a proposal for rulemaking.    XRP    XRP was developed and launched by Larsen's Ripple Labs co-founder Arthur Britto and tech chief David Schwartz in 2012. Ripple maintains 55 billion XRP in escrow, releasing 1 billion every month. Unused XRP is returned to escrow.      According to Messari, Ripple has sold about $1.2 billion in XRP over the years.      XRP's price fell after news of the impending lawsuit came out, dropping 12% on the 24-hour trading period to below 50 cents. The cryptocurrency's price had already begun falling earlier in the day, joining a broader market decline.      An SEC spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment. After the publication of this article, a Ripple spokesperson emailed the following statement, attributed to Garlinghouse:    The SEC is fundamentally wrong as a matter of law and fact. XRP is a currency, and does not have to be registered as an investment contract. In fact, the Justice Department and the Treasury's FinCEN already determined that XRP is a virtual currency in 2015 and other G20 regulators have done the same. No other country has classified XRP as a security.The SEC has permitted XRP to function as a currency for over eight years, and we question the motivation for bringing this action just days before the change in administration. Instead of providing a clear regulatory framework for crypto in the U.S., [SEC Commissioner] Jay Clayton inexplicably decided to sue Ripple – leaving the actual legal work to the next Administration.This is an attack on the entire crypto industry and American innovation. By giving the stamp of approval only to bitcoin and ether (whose networks are at the mercy of the Chinese Communist Party), the SEC has picked the winners - disregarding an entire industry outside of these two tokens. Ignoring advice from national security experts and the U.S. government, Jay Clayton is handing over the future of our global financial systems - underpinned by blockchain and crypto technologies - to an authoritarian regime.We are right and will aggressively fight - and win - this battle in the courts to get clear rules of the road for the entire industry in the U.S. We are on the right side of the law, the right side of policy and will absolutely be on the right side of history. In the meantime, it's business as usual for Ripple and our hundreds of customers made up of the world's top financial institutions that have come to depend on Ripple to deliver high-value solutions.
