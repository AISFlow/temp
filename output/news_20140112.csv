42425255,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvo9h,1389567921,"Chinese Government-Backed TV Program Bashes Bitcoin, Outrages Community","The business channel of China Central Television (CCTV2), the country’s government-backed national television broadcaster, is the subject of bias allegations for a program that cast a negative light on bitcoin and the Chinese bitcoin community.  The program  , entitled Outrageous Bitcoin, features four accounts on events that took place in the aftermath of the central bank's ban on banks and third party payment processors from working with bitcoin exchanges.  The cast of interviewees are quite representative of the Chinese bitcoin community – a trader, a mining equipment vendor, a businessman running an exchange and a couple who host a bitcoin videocast program. However, it was rife with negative suggestions, such as comparisons of bitcoin to a Ponzi scheme and Dutch Tulip Mania. Overall the half-hour long program seemed unprofessionally imbalanced, focusing only on stories involving people who suffered financial losses from bitcoin investment.  Tales of bitcoin woe  The broadcast began with the story of Wang Yizhou, a 19 year-old who discovered bitcoin in late November last year. After investing his total savings of about 60,000 yuan ($9,910), Wang was caught off-guard when exchange rates tumbled on 17th December. After some hesitation, Wang cut his losses shortly after the price reached the lowest point. Wang continued that he knew more people who lost money from bitcoin trading than those who made gains.  The program then interviewed Star Xu (Xu Mingxing), CEO of exchange OKCoin, who told a story of someone whose 100,000-yuan ($16,520) investment halved in the crash.  The third person, Zhang Fei, was a Taobao vendor who originally ran a successful online cosmetics store. Zhang was attracted by the high margins of selling bitcoin mining hardware and decided to shift his focus. After a brief period of euphoria, a flood of refund requests forced Zhang out of business. Taobao recently banned the sale of bitcoins and mining gear on its site.  Jin Yangyang and Guo Hongcai, a couple who host a popular bitcoin videocast, gave an account of how people cried on the phone for help while they could do little to comfort them.  Backlash  The documentary, aired on the night of 11th January, caused immediate backlash from bitcoiners including Jin and Guo themselves. In their latest videocast, they complained the program used only a few minutes of a two-hour long interview and edited it to present only the TV station’s point of view rather than theirs. After the program was aired, the couple said, they received a large amount of criticism, and even verbal abuse from angry bitcoiners who felt they had been misrepresented. Now the couple say they were used and betrayed by the TV station.  The program also caused some speculation as to whether it might be a precursor to further government intervention.  Although it was an overwhelmingly negative portrayal, one ray of optimism managed to shine through, and from an unlikely person – despite his investment losses, the 19-year-old Wang Yizhou’s view on bitcoin remains full of hope:  “Once nobody believed that there would be airplanes, then there were. Just like airplanes are a big leap, a revolution, so will bitcoin be.”  Zennon Kapron, founder of financial services consultancy Kapronasia in Shanghai, who has written a report on bitcoin in China, noted:  ""[The documentary] is in keeping with overall government efforts which seem focused on limiting the market and uptake of bitcoin in China. What is interesting is that arguably one of the first drivers of bitcoin in China was a CCTV documentary towards the beginning of 2013, which was very positive about the [digital currency]. The new documentary shows that either the government did not expect the uptake or impact of bitcoin in China to be as large as it was, or they had a bit of a rethink about what they wanted bitcoin to become.""

42425267,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvoVh,1389558846,China’s Bitcoin Exchanges Survived the Crackdown and Did Battle in the Aftermath,"Leon Li, CEO of China's leading bitcoin exchange Huobi, recently recalled how China's central bank ban sent shockwaves through the bitcoin world at a meet-up in Garage Café, Beijing.  Addressing an audience of around 300 people, Li (also known in China as Li Lin) recounted how his site's trading volume spiked so rapidly on the night of 16th December that the visiting traffic easily maxed out the exchange’s servers.  Even though Li and his colleagues pulled two all-nighters to process the large amount of requests for cash withdrawals, rumours abounded that Li was a scammer who had already run away with deposits that the exchange was trusted with.  Li went on to say that before he started Huobi, he initially believed a rumour that BTC China would sell its own bitcoin holdings first before processing traders’ orders, in times when there were clear signs the exchange rates would plunge. He didn't expect, though, that he would suffer the same false rumours himself so soon – Huobi replaced BTC China as China's biggest exchange before the end of the year.  Trust in the exchanges, it appears, remains a weak link in the Chinese bitcoin ecosystem.  Watershed moment  The turmoil triggered by the Chinese central bank ban, in retrospect, was a watershed moment for China's bitcoin exchanges – those that responded quickly went on to prosper, while those who failed to live up to expectations lost ground.  [post-quote]  Huobi, despite frequent criticism over its slow loading speed and other glitches, won the top spot largely due to the fact it offered an alternative depositing solution when most of its competitors remained shell shocked. One of these depositing options involved Li's personal bank account. However, this option has reportedly been removed as of today.  The exchange also stuck to its commission-free policy when others like OKCoin and BTC China reinstated per-trade commission fees, which contributed to its popularity.  On the other hand, some lesser-known exchanges have closed shop or switched their focus to altcoins.  BTC China and OKCoin both suffered a substantial loss of users in the aftermath of the ban. The reason? The suspension of deposits and the introduction of unpopular trading commissions.  OKCoin, in particular, underwent a confidence crisis after its CEO Star Xu (Xu Mingxing) was accused of faking trading volume.  Winning back trust  If the closure of Hong Kong-registered GBL is any indication, bitcoin exchanges with a shadowy, media-shy team must be shunned at all cost. When operating in a legal vacuum where regulation is gapingly absent, user confidence is hard won and easily lost.  Rumours of unethical practice, unfounded as they may be, can be damaging to both exchanges and users. The major exchanges are aware of this problem, and have been seeking to address it by bolstering communication. Most exchanges in China have begun to utilise social media, for example.  However, the exchanges’ customer service departments are usually understaffed and inefficient. On Huobi, for example, the waiting time for a reply from customer services can range from five to 30 minutes or longer. The website has recently offered dedicated customer service reps for its big traders, though this is well beyond the reach of most small investors.  The individual reputations of exchange founders can be a factor too. In cases of Li and Xu, long before they started their Bitcoin businesses, both were successful IT veterans and graduates from China’s most prestigious universities. Both are active on Weibo, China’s Twitter-like service, and other popular social media platforms.  Arguably, the benefit of maintaining a social media profile is to convey a sense of presence, constantly making announcements that “we are still here and well”. The importance of this is not to be underestimated, given that many Chinese bitcoin users still view the scenario of exchanges becoming illegal and founders being put in jail as a realistic one.  Xu, CEO of OKCoin, is a co-sponsor of the Garage Café meet-up too. During his talk, he made a plea to the audience not to use bitcoin as a speculative vehicle. Xu said:  “If the exchange rate shoots up as crazily as in November, there is a good chance that we will spend this Spring Festival behind bars.”  Sponsoring bitcoin events like this certainly works well as a way to soften hard feelings and skepticism towards the exchange – putting human faces to the otherwise shadowy names. People want the assurance that their money is in safe hands, and such assurance can be afforded in no better way than knowing the people behind the exchanges personally.  Recently, Xu also started to host smaller, more private dinners with bitcoin enthusiasts and media professionals. At one such dinner on the 9th January, Li explained the rationale behind OKCoin’s decision to reinstate (and later revoke) the trading commission system.  The commission dilemma  When OKCoin introduced a per-trade commission fee system on 17th December last year, there was immediate backlash from users. The timing couldn’t have been worse. At a point when many people were rushing to cash out, imposing fees without advance notice gave the impression that the exchange was trying to get every last nickel from its customers while it still could.  Hardly anyone paid attention to the flip-side of Xu's argument. As counterintuitive as it may sound, Xu believes that a fee system is necessary to protect small traders from their larger counterparts who have the prowess to manipulate the rise and fall of exchange rates.  On 1st January, 13 days after the fee system was implemented, OKCoin held a user vote to decide whether the system should continue. However, this “by the people and for the people” ethic only attracted ridicule.  Users argued that the result of the vote would be too obvious – nobody would want to pay if they didn’t have to – and besides, OKCoin just wanted to use the vote to soften the embarrassment of backtracking from its previous stance.  Will the commission-free trend continue? Xu said that this should be decided by users themselves, and possibly, the government – if it will take a stance at all. If Xu’s attitude is ambivalent, Li Lin is a fervent supporter of the commission-free system. At the January meet-up, Li told the audience that as long as he was in charge of Huobi, there would never be a commission fee.  This, of course, made him the most popular speaker of the night.  Hanging in the balance  Though China's central bank ban may have blocked some of the easier ways to make deposits, its ramifications are more psychological than technical.  Most exchanges have implemented systems that enable traders to charge accounts. There are, of course, drawbacks to a wire transfer approach, which involves manual processing, and can take a long time.  A more innovative approach has been taken by BTC China. It debuted a voucher system that enables users to turn their bitcoin or fiat money deposits into codes, which can be traded offline and redeemed on the exchange. If you are new to bitcoin and have just opened an account on BTC China, buying a voucher from another exchange user can be a much faster way of making deposits.  However, these vouchers often rely on online marketplaces. With Taobao having announced a ban on cryptocurrencies, the strength of the voucher system will surely be tested. As demonstrated by market response to last month’s central bank ban, as well as last week’s Taobao story, any reaction is bound to be an overreaction in the current market environment.  The lack of transparency and consistency on the side of the government serves only to increase bitcoiners' mistrust and bitcoin's market volatility.  A tempting hypothesis is that the government may try to maintain a balance. Something will be done if it deems that there is a tendency towards over-speculation, though trying to tell what the Chinese government has up its sleeve, with no reliable information coming to light, is no different from reading tea leaves.

42425270,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvoZh,1389537022,Four Ways to Satisfy Your Appetite With Bitcoin,"Much is made of bitcoin’s earth-shattering potential to revolutionise the way we use and even perceive money.  Invented after the global crash of 2007, the cryptocurrency seems to offer an as yet ambiguous alternative to the old pre-crash world.  But, if we were to imagine these serious conversations being had by serious people with very serious and solemn faces, you would find me loitering on the other side of the room beside the canapés desperately stuffing as many into my face as possible.  Yes, your funny money sounds great, but can I eat it? At the very least, can I use it to satiate my huge and ever-present hunger?  Thankfully yes, here are four of the best ways to eat with bitcoin.  1. Eating on the street  If, while walking around London’s Shoreditch area, you find yourself overcome with an animalistic yearning for a piece of meat hugged closely by two bits of bread, there are many restaurants and pubs to choose from.  But if you’re flying the flag of the good ship bitcoin, there’s only one place for you: Burger Bear. Probably the first street vendor in the UK to accept bitcoin, Burger Bear serves artisanal burgers and has been taking bitcoin payments since late November. “The best burger in the world” is how one bitcoiner, Ryan Holder, described his purchase.  In the US, Peruvian Brothers in Washington DC and Cheese Wizards in Seattle are leading the food truck industry’s acceptance of bitcoin. Fingers crossed more and more street vendors begin accepting bitcoin in 2014.  2. Back to the farm  There’s nothing finer than fresh produce straight from the farm. Whether it be tasty peppers, glistening strawberries or just fresh greens, buying straight from the source always beats going to the supermarkets.  If you are lucky enough to live in the Provo, Utah, the La Nay Ferme farm offers “naturally grown fruits and vegetables” you can buy with bitcoin. You can either join their CSA (community supported agriculture project), purchase a weekly share of their produce, or simply take your pick from their fresh selection each week.  Down in Argentina, the Tierra Buena Network delivers organic farm produce to customers and welcomes bitcoiners with open arms.  3. Don’t even leave the house  If you’re the type of bitcoiner who’s inclined to order a takeaway instead of venturing beyond your front door (or, god-forbid, into the kitchen), there is also hope for you.  Takeaway.com and many of the websites it owns in countries across the world now accept bitcoin for food deliveries.  American bitcoiners probably have it easiest, with restaurant delivery network Foodler, which works with 12,000 restaurants, accepting bitcoins since April.  Most of their purchases are in San Francisco and Washington DC. Although a future utopia where you can order any takeout you like with bitcoin isn’t fully realised yet, we’re getting there slowly.  4. Survive the zombie apocalypse  Artisanal burgers, fresh farm produce and home delivery are all great right now. But when the zombie apocalypse comes a-knocking, they’ll be little use to you (although a restaurant willing to battle the undead to bring hot curry to your front door would probably do good business in the apocalypse).  When the day of judgement comes, you’ll want to make sure you’re prepared. That’s where SurvivalFood.comhttp://www.survivalfood.com/bitcoin/ comes in. It accepts bitcoin and sells delights like the “Mountain House Turkey Tetrazzini Pouch” and the “Bandito Scramble Eggs Potatoes Breakfast Pouch”, both of which have a shelf life of seven years.  So, if corpses begin bursting from their graves, you can rest easy knowing that bitcoin helped keep you fed and happy.  Just don’t forget to lock your front door.

42425262,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvoJh,1389524412,"Sean's Outpost Founder Plans Ultra-Marathon to Raise 1,000 BTC","Bitcoin donations have helped Sean's Outpost, a homeless outreach centre in Pensacola, Florida, to achieve outsized success this year.  Donations flooded in when its founder, Jason King, asked for bitcoin contributions back in March. As 2013 drew to a close, he announced:  ""We served 30,000 meals in 2013 and we were able to make a downpayment and pay off the first year's mortgage for Satoshi's Forest, our nine-acre homeless sanctuary. We got a lot done in 2013 for a new charity.""  Sean's Outpost  raised more than 200 BTC this year from donations, according to King. Now the homelessness activist wants to contribute to the bitcoin community in his own way, by running 5,172 km from Miami to San Francisco to raise funding and awareness about both bitcoin and homelessness.  He said: “It's basically running a marathon a day, every day, for four months.""  Long-distance enthusiast  King is a long-distance running enthusiast who says he has run ""several hundred"" kilometres before, although this would be the longest run he's attempted.  [post-quote]  He will set off from the North American Bitcoin Conference which ends on 26th January, in Miami, where the starting gun will be fired.  King will then make his way to Austin, which is 2,166 km or a 19-hour drive away, to speak at the Texas Bitcoin Conference on 6th March.  His support crew for the trip will consist of his wife and three children, who will drive alongside him in the family campervan.  ""We're working on the route right now. We'll be planning bitcoin meetups, so anyone can stop by and meet up. We'll have information for people who don't know anything about bitcoin.""  King added that he hasn't decided on the finish line yet, but it would be one of the many bitcoin hangouts in San Francisco.  Without a hitch  Given his four month absence from Sean's Outpost, how will the charity fare without its founder's presence?  King stressed that although the media spotlight has been focused on him this year, the charity has a full-time staff of five and a team of 10 volunteers that will keep it running smoothly, no pun intended.  ""It should run without a hitch without me there. I'll still be helping out, answering e-mails, but everything can't just go away because Jason King's not there.""  King has set the audacious goal of raising 1,000 BTC over the course of the run, he said: “I know it's a lot to expect in four months, but homelessness is a big problem.""  Sean's Outpost currently works with more than 400 homeless people in Pensacola, a city with a population of about 461,000. Some of these people have remained ambivalent about bitcoin, while others have embraced the cryptocurrency. King said:  ""We have guys who got really into bitcoin. They're on reddit and forums all the time. We have guys who got off the street because of bitcoin.""  Sean Dugas  According to King, of the 200 BTC raised by his charity this year, almost all of it has been spent. Sean's Outpost has, however, maintained a reserve fund of 30 BTC, which it intends to hold as an investment.  The continuing media attention on the organisation, which is named after King's ""best friend"" Sean Dugas, who was murdered in 2012, has made King uncomfortable, although he is trying to capitalise on it for his activism. He is working on opening up Sean's Outposts in other cities.  ""[The media attention] has been a little awkward, because I like to focus on the work I do. But I'm asking people all over the world to believe in what we're doing, so communicating back is an important part of the relationship.""

42425258,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvoFh,1389515715,Colorado Marijuana Dispensary Uses Bitcoin to Evade Federal Laws,"At least one marijuana dispensary in Colorado has reportedly begun accepting bitcoin.  Colorado’s decision to legalize cannabis has been filling headlines for weeks, and the hype is still going strong.  Investors have been piling up in the marijuana market, ranging from reputable medicinal marijuana companies to highly speculative penny stocks.  The general public seems to be very interested indeed – outside some dispensaries the queues of pot lovers are incredibly large, resembling the lines frequently formed in front of Apple Stores following an iPhone launch.  However, there are a number of problems. Demand has been so strong that many dispensaries are having trouble getting enough marijuana to sell, although this is likely a temporary issue.  Banks playing it safe  A somewhat bigger problem for dispensaries lurks in federal law. They cannot accept credit card payments, so all purchases must be in cash – or bitcoin.  [post-quote]  Bloomberg’s Matt Miller believes that this is because banks are simply not willing to enter the market, which is understandable.  Most US credit card companies are headquartered in Delaware rather than Colorado – and cannabis is still very much illegal in Joe Biden’s home state.  Banks and credit card companies are playing it safe. They must comply with federal legislation and although it might be possible to come up with a workaround, they do not appear interested at this point.  Federal law has forced dispensaries to accept cash, and cash only – but bitcoin is a tempting alternative. Anonymity does not matter, since recreational marijuana is legal in Colorado, but with no credit cards in the mix, it is practically the only alternative.  Sales of recreational marijuana in Colorado are reportedly exceeding $5m a week, and banks simply cannot enter the fray until regulators give them the green light.  Drugs, cash and prohibition  Some pundits are comparing Colorado’s decision to legalize marijuana to the demise of the 18th Amendment, which prohibited sales of alcohol in the US back in the roaring twenties.  When the 18th Amendment was enacted, the government lost a fair slice of tax revenue, but the prohibition also loosely coincided with the introduction of federal income tax in 1913. In other words, the government could afford to lose a bit of revenue in order to appease the temperance movement.  The prohibition did not work, as it forced millions of Americans to break the law on a daily basis, becoming scofflaws. It also ushered in a golden era for organized criminals running rum from the Caribbean, whisky from Canada or distilling potentially deadly bathtub 'moonshine'.  The 18th Amendment was repealed at a time when the US needed as much tax revenue as possible, just as the country was starting to emerge from the Great Depression.  Bitcoin's critics like to point out that digital currencies are often used for illicit transactions, like buying illegal drugs. This is, of course, the case with practically every currency on the planet.  Drugs are the reason why the largest denomination of the US dollar is the Ben Franklin-themed $100 bill.The Nixon administration discontinued all larger denominations in 1969, arguing that the move would make it more difficult for drug traffickers to transport and launder their profits.  Bitcoin boom  There are about 350 licensed dispensaries in Colorado, and many analysts believe annual marijuana revenue could be as much as $500m, which is relatively high for a population of 5.2 million people (no pun intended).  The National Cannabis Industry Association predicts medical marijuana sales of $250m, along with more than $200m in recreational sales. Nationwide, the government-regulated marijuana market is expected to double to $2.3bn.  With as much as half a billion dollars up for grabs, banks will no doubt try to enter the market, but this may not be as easy as it seems. For example, if they get an exemption, the next administration might simply revoke it.  However, Colorado may have a vested interest in getting banks on board. In other words, bitcoin has a chance, but banks will inevitably crack the market sooner or later.  The state wants to raise $70m in tax revenue from cannabis sales this year. However, the figure may end up even higher due to high demand (pun intended).
