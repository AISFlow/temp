42425152,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHteXh,1386098930,Bitcoin Price Could Reach $98.5k Say Wall Street Analysts,"The price of bitcoin could increase to as much as $98,500, according to analysts at financial services and investment firm Wedbush Securities.  A report from analysts Gil Luria and Aaron Turner, which has been referenced on StreetInsider.com, takes an extremely positive view of bitcoin, suggesting digital currency has the potential to shake up the current payments space.  Titled Bitcoin: Intrinsic Value as Conduit for Disruptive Payment Network Technology, the report states:  ""Among other facets, we believe bitcoin and its associated technology represent a potentially game-changing disruption to our covered payments companies.""  The authors go on to claim cryptocurrency provides a ""powerful alternative to branded networks"" due to its decentralised processing, new functionality and use of market-based fees.  Hot topic  The price of bitcoin has been a hot topic over the past week, with the digital currency increasing to the dizzy highs of $1,165 on Saturday, according to the CoinDesk BPI. On Mt. Gox, the price topped $1,242, overtaking the price of gold for the first time (gold was at $1,241 per ounce).  Erik Voorhees, who sold gambling site SatoshiDice for 126,315 BTC this year, said this showed what a ""respectable asset"" bitcoin is becoming.  ""Clearly, bitcoin is no longer a penny stock. It's playing in the big leagues - a share being worth more than a share of Google or Apple, and even more then an ounce of gold,"" he said at the time.  The value has dipped over the past day or so, with the price, at the time of writing, hovering at around $1,071.  Up or down?  Many people have been asserting that the current high value is merely a temporary spike and that it will soon plummet to the level seen in September and October (around $120-$150), or perhaps even lower.  Luria and Turner disagree, believing the value will continue to increase over the coming years. They said:  ""We believe rising bitcoin prices help build the network thus entrenching its value, especially vis-à-vis other alternative coins/conduits. Based on this framework, we would postulate that current bitcoin prices reflect a peak penetration of 1% of total potential demand in 10 years.""  Last month, the Winklevoss twins remarked that they envisioned bitcoin increasing by 100 times. At the time of their comments, the price of bitcoin was $343, so the value has already increased by over 211%.  Speaking to CNBC at the Dealbook conference in New York, Tyler Winklevoss, who was involved in the creation of Facebook, said: “Some people definitely view [bitcoin] as Gold 2.0.""  Chamath's millions  Ex-Facebook executive Chamath Palihapitiya is also pretty bullish about bitcoin.  At the end of October, he revealed he owned $5m worth of the digital currency, but said he was hoping to build that to $10m-$15m. On October 29th, the price of bitcoin was just under $200, so it is likely he had around 25,000 BTC. That quantity of bitcoins is now worth over $26m, so it seems Palihapitiya got what he wished for, and then some.  Back in May, he wrote an opinion piece for Bloomberg stating that bitcoin could become a ""better version"" of gold, or even a replacement for the precious metal. With all the gold in the world totalling around $8 trillion, Palihapitiya said, if bitcoin replaced gold as a store of value, each bitcoin would cost almost $400,000, once all 21m bitcoins have been mined ($8 trillion/21m BTC).  ""If bitcoin grows into something bigger – a useful reserve currency, then watch out: Its value will far exceed $400,000,"" he wrote, adding:  ""I personally think that bitcoin is already superior to gold. Its role as currency is yet to be determined, but over the next decade, being Gold 2.0 will suffice considering that it would represent a more than 3,000 times return.""  The problem with volatility  While many people believe that, in the long run, the price of bitcoin will be considerably higher than it is now, the common view is that its volatility will continue in the short term.  Luria and Turner explained in their report that this volatility is a result of an ""extended price discovery process"". It is believed that the more liquidity bitcoin gains and the more widely it is adopted, the greater the likelihood is of the price stabilising.  Currently, the currency's volatility is the factor that is putting a high percentage of people off taking bitcoin seriously.  University of California-San Diego researcher Sarah Meiklejohn, who wrote a paper called A Fistful of Bitcoins: Characterizing Payments Among Men With No Names, told CoinDesk the thing that makes her the ""most nervous"" about bitcoin is its volatility.  ""It’s a chicken or egg problem. You need more people to adopt bitcoin in order to stabilize this, but people are shying away from bitcoin because they perceive it as volatile and as a risky investment,"" she said.  The solution to this problem isn't yet clear, but the bitcoin community and the businesses within it continue to work hard to make it easier for merchants to accept bitcoins and consumers to obtain it and then spend it.  What do you think is key for the stability of bitcoin?

42425159,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHtenh,1386097392,Is Europe's Second Largest Bitcoin Exchange BTC-e Having Banking Issues?,"UPDATED on 6th December at 13:00 GMT.  CoinDesk spoke with Mayzus financial today to query the status of investor deposits delayed in transit to BTC-e. Although they said that they were unable to comment on specific customer deposits, they advised that by signing up to their services they would be able to provide some more information on individual customer accounts. Mayzus offers a wide range of virtual currency exchange services and is regulated by the FCA and HM Revenue and Customs as well as being registered with iAMTN, UKMTA, SWIFT and ICO.  Mayzus revealed that BTC-e is currently in the process of updating their customer services and server architecture, that they've been overwhelmed by the amount of new deposits and traffic to their site and that they are working to resolve the backlogs, and hope to have cleared all customer funds by January.  In another twist, a commenter on reddit today revealed that OKPAY requires its users to tick a box stating: ""I hereby confirm that [I] will not use the funds for purchasing or exchanging crypto-currencies"". CoinDesk will update this story as more details of OKPAY's policy emerge.    ------------------------------------------------------------      Concerned voices are being raised about the second largest European exchange BTC-e which handles as much as 30,000 BTC in trade volume a day with users on reddit and Bitcoin Talk asserting that their SEPA and IBAN bank transfers have not been credited to their accounts for many weeks, and that BTC-e refuses to respond to their help request tickets.    CoinDesk contacted BTC-e for comment but was initially referred to their support facility located in Thailand, which when contacted, offered no response. Subsequent requests for comment have remained unanswered.  The exchange is the least transparent of the big four exchanges, the other three being BTC China, Mt. Gox and Bitstamp.  This lack of transparency has created confusion over who exactly is behind the exchange – the owners apparently wish to remain anonymous, using a long chain of banks and intermediaries to process deposits and withdrawals.  CoinDesk has learned that BTC-e does not use a bank account with a company name, instead choosing to use a third party to provide banking services.  Depositors send money to UK company Mayzus Financial Services Ltd's Deutsche Bank account in the Czech Republic who use OKPAY, an e-currency provider registered in the British Virgin Isles to transfer users' funds directly to the exchange.  According to Mayzus' website:    ""Mayzus Financial Services is registered in the United Kingdom as an independent organization under the number 06721866. It is also a full-fledged provider of financial services with the registration number 12492642.      Legality and security with Mayzus Financial Services are guaranteed by several international documents such as the Anti-Money Laundering Act, the license of Financial Conduct Authority of Great Britain (FCA), and by its membership in the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT).""    In addition, OKPAY require notarized documents to verify its customers.  During this torturous route, the account information that is provided by BTC-e at the initiation must stay with the transaction, which may well be copied manually by hand from one account to the next. If the account information is lost, Mayzus has no way of telling (apparently) who the money is to be paid to.  Another problem appears to be that BTC-e has stopped accepting dollar transfers or transfers from US banks. As most international wire transfers are denominated in dollars, even paying money from a UK bank account into BTC-e involves changing pounds to dollars with the result that they may never make it through to the intended exchange account.  As if that wasn’t enough to worry about, some people are reporting that SEPA transfers in euros are not arriving either.  Opinions on whether BTC-e is legitimately having problems or whether something more nefarious is going on are varied with the most paranoid claiming that the exchange is simply run by thieves, and others like this user on reddit stating:  “Not to defend BTC-e, but it seems that any time something goes wrong with a bitcoin service people start shouting scam straight away. Sometimes things just go wrong…”  Another points out  :    ""I've sent large amounts by wire and it's always worked within 24 hours. Check your deposit was sent with EXACTLY the reference they mandate in the USD->deposit->bank wire section with all the spaces and periods. Check with your bank what they actually sent then file a ticket at BTC-e.      As for verification at BTC-e they only ask AFTER money is credited to your account and you cannot withdraw anything until you provide what they ask. You will only know this because when you press withdraw, it will say ""withdraw hold"" in red.""    CoinDesk will update the story as it develops.

42425164,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHtevh,1386090689,Online Jewellery Merchant Forges Links with Bitcoin Community,"Mane Antu, a semi-precious jewellery merchant, has announced it is to accept bitcoin payments on its website.  It's the latest in a string of online businesses that have welcomed the currency in recent weeks. It seems retailers of all sizes are eager to cash in on bitcoin’s ever-growing fanbase.  Mane Antu  has chosen to accept the digital currency via Coinbase transfers and direct deposits to its wallet address.  So far, the company has only processed two transactions in bitcoin, though founders Daniela Esparza and Miquel Angel Candelas remain confident the currency will bring many new customers to their site.  However, it wasn't just the promise of new customers that influenced the pair's decision. Esparza said:  “We believe in the potential of bitcoin, firstly, because it is worthy and useful; secondly, because we would like to stabilise its use.”  Bitcoin’s potential is appealing to smaller retailers who seek a viable alternative to PayPal’s fees and the international banking system as a whole.  Esparza cited bitcoin as ""the currency of the future"", adding that it appealed to the company’s ideals of ""freedom and efficiency"".  A nomad life  Mane Antu's ‘heart and hand-made jewellery’ business began four years ago, when Esparza and Candelas were low-budget backpackers finding a way to fund their travels.  They began trading in objects: sourcing semi-precious stones from Pakistan to sell in Brasil, and African fossils to sell in Europe. Daniela's skills as a designer, combined with Miquel's ability to unearth rare stones and fossils from remote locations, grew into a company that valued, above all, the freedom of a “nomad life”.  When Esparza and Candelas discovered bitcoin eight months ago while searching on the web, Esparza said: “We realised that bitcoin offered us a monetary system beyond the borders; an ideal currency for a free world; the perfect money for a nomad life. A life that isn’t controlled by a superior authority within a hierarchical economic system.”  Bitcoin retailers  Worldwide, a significant proportion of bitcoin transactions on merchant sites are jewellery purchases.  Mercy Chikowore, a spokesperson for online merchant BitcoinShop.US, said that figure stood at roughly 15% of the site's overall orders. She added that the site frequently receives requests for better deals on jewellery items.  This news comes as retailer Gyft accepts bitcoin payments for gift cards that can be redeemed at fashion and jewellery brands like Zales, Gap and Target.  Comparing the currency to a well-designed pair of shoes, Esparza said bitcoin was a technological masterpiece, although she warned:  ""Bitcoin will remain as long as it is useful. We are now starting to test its usefulness.""",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Grace Caffyn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/12/03/online-jewellery-merchant-forges-links-with-bitcoin-community,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/89ad861e26cc867dc2137f1ab0cfb643eee22991-1024x768.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425151,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHteRh,1386080524,Coinality: Job Seekers Rush to Apply for Roles Paid in Bitcoin,"Coinality, an online jobs board advertising roles paid in various digital currencies, has gained 850 registered users since it launched in September.  Coinality  lets users post vacancies that pay in bitcoin and litecoin, as well as other cryptocurrencies. The site's founder, Daniel Roseman, believes this will contribute to bitcoin's viability as a currency. He said:  ""Coinality provides a way to acquire bitcoins, not by mining or purchase, but by working or offering a service. The overwhelming number of job applications suggests that people really want to work for bitcoin.""  Roseman said his site has received 611 applications for 313 advertisements since its launch. At the time of writing, Coinality has 850 registered users and 69 active job ads.  By contrast, Indeed, a website advertising fiat-paying jobs, has uploaded 292,631 new vacancies in the last seven days, and employers on the site can choose from 156,000 applicants in London alone. Although Coinality's figures look meagre in comparison, they still show that jobseeker interest in the fledgling currency is increasing.  Jobs available  A large number of jobs listed on Coinality are with bitcoin miners and exchanges. Positions include: Chief Compliance Officer at Coinsetter, Outside Sales Executive at The Bitcoin Investment Trust and a Mandarin-speaking Engineer at Butterfly Labs.  Currently, the highest paying job on Coinality is a developer position at a bitcoin startup being run by Trace Mayer and Kevin Bombino, in 'stealth' mode. The advertised pay is 51 BTC – 100 BTC, or $55,000 – $109,000 (US dollars) per year, with equity in the startup as additional compensation.  Coinality has a few jobs listed that are not directly related to mining or exchanging bitcoin. One posting advertises a one-time fee of 0.1 BTC for solving a cryptographic puzzle. Another advert seeks a guest house manager in Austria. A third is a vacancy for a safety officer aboard a ship in the Philippines.  But how many users are willing to stake their livelihoods on a bitcoin salary, given the currency's volatility? According to Roseman, no one has raised these concerns yet:  ""I don't believe many users are earning income exclusively in bitcoin. Most users are seeking to increase their bitcoin holdings through labour or services, or are interested in acquiring bitcoin for the first time.""  Coinality is a free service for employers and job-seekers. Users can also upload their resumes for potential employers to find. Additionally, the site has an RSS feed of bitcoin-related jobs on larger job sites like oDesk, Careerjet and SimplyHired.  According to Roseman, job ads on Coinality are reviewed by ""humans of reasonably sound judgment"". However, some job ads (including the ship's safety officer) appear dubious. For example, the employer's website on that listing doesn't exist, and further searches don't reveal anything more promising. Emails seeking comment sent to four employers and individuals who advertised on Coinality have not been returned.  Existing job boards  Many other platforms exist for job-seekers who want to be paid in bitcoin. The subreddit /r/Jobs4Bitcoins is a popular destination. Platforms like oDesk and Elance, which let freelancers find specific work, feature jobs connected to bitcoin mining and exchanges – some of which can be compensated in bitcoin.  Unlike Coinality, oDesk and Elance charge for their services. Odesk takes a 10% cut on a freelancer's fee while eLance extracts 8.75%. Roseman said that while these services have more users, charging is against bitcoin's ethos.  ""Coinality keeps its services completely free, and aligns itself with the 'frictionless' and 'free use' nature of bitcoin,"" he added.  Hire Me!

42425148,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHteVh,1386073235,"Bitcoin Talk Hacked Again, Members Urged to Change Passwords","Bitcoin is stateless, frictionless and more valuable than ever. But these things also mean that BTC is a security risk, from an IT perspective.  Case in point is the popular virtual currency forum Bitcoin Talk. The site was recently hacked, and the administrators have posted a note regarding the possibility of compromised passwords over a recent period of time:  “If you used your password to login between 06:00 Dec 1 UTC and 20:00 Dec 2 UTC, then your password may have been captured in a man-in-the-middle attack, and you should change your password here and wherever else you used it. If you were only logged in via the ""remember me"" feature, then you're OK.”  A man-in-the-middle attack can be performed by spoofing a public key exchange, which puts a hacker or group of hackers in a position to gather data somewhat unsuspectingly. In this case, it appears that the intruders were attempting to steal username and corresponding password information.  Travis Skweres, the CEO of virtual currency exchange CoinMKT, says that security is a major issue for any bitcoin-related property. He indicated that attackers have tried to compromise his site, causing some delays in the exchange’s build-out. Skweres said:  ""Unfortunately all of the attributes that make bitcoin great - over the web, no chargebacks, easy to send - also make it a huge target for hackers. Online security is more important than ever before in the world of digital money, and it's not just businesses that will have to adjust, but users as well.”  Bitcoin Talk has previously been a victim of DDoS attacks – there have been numerous reports of downtime for the forum in the past. Also, back in October, the site was hacked by a group calling themselves “The Hole Seekers”. During the hack, the site displayed animations of bombs exploding and photos of classical music conductors, all set to the 1812 Overture, which is also the soundtrack to the explosion scene in V for Vendetta.  The forum itself does not actually exchange or transact in virtual currencies; rather it has simply been a facilitator of information and communication regarding virtual currencies. Yet it has been a resource for both good and bad.  Bitcoin Savings and Trust, for example, which was allegedly operated as a Ponzi scheme, garnered a number of “customers” from Bitcoin Talk under the guise of username pirateat40. Its proprietor has been charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for defrauding investors.  The key for anyone that is interested in participating in the bitcoin economy is vigilance and due diligence, according to Skweres.  “We're going to see more and more stories of millions being stolen until security and user habits catch up with the current state of the web,"" he said.

42425150,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHteTh,1386069837,Users Track $100 Million in Stolen Bitcoin After Sheep Marketplace Hack,"The closure of black market site Sheep Marketplace took a mysterious turn over the weekend, as users allegedly tracked nearly 100,000 stolen bitcoins, worth over $100m, through the block chain.  Sheep Marketplace  was taken down over the weekend, citing a theft of $5.3m in bitcoin and toppling rival site Black Market Reloaded in the process.  Black Market Reloaded announced its closure amid worries that Sheep Marketplace's migrating users could overload the site.  Since then, claims have emerged suggesting far more coins were stolen, with many users saying the owners themselves have perpetrated the fraud.  Withdrawals blocked  The issues surrounding Sheep Marketplace began several days ago, when vendors and customers reportedly found themselves unable to withdraw coins from the marketplace's escrow system.  Administrators told users they would be able to withdraw their funds after some organisational changes. Then, with many vendors and users still waiting for their funds, the Sheep Marketplace forums were shut down.  On Sunday, the site itself was closed: replaced with a message reporting that a vendor had stolen a large number of bitcoins. It read: “We are sorry to say, but we were robbed on Saturday 11/21/2013 by vendor EBOOK101. This vendor found [a] bug in system and stole 5400 BTC – your money, our provisions, all was stolen.”  In the days since, this message has been inaccessible.  Accusations  Other reports refute the site's claims – highlighting the administrators' potential involvement in the heist. One site, Sheep Market Scam, has attempted to document the events of the last few days. It suggests that around 40,000 BTC was transferred from a bitcoin address rumoured to be associated with Sheep Marketplace.  Reddit user throwme1121, who predicted that Sheep Marketplace was a scam, said:  “Look up your Sheep deposit addresses on Blockchain. Follow any outgoing money. It's a mass exodus of BTC from Sheep addresses to external holding wallets.”  The redditor also pointed to the movement of around 40,000 bitcoins through this single address. The first transaction to the address took place on 8th November.  “I'm guessing that some amount of it is the Sheep commissions, but wildly guessing, no more than half,” said another redditor, researcher Gwern Branwen.  Mixers discovered  Consequently, on Sunday a UK redditor claimed to have tracked the movement of roughly 96,000 BTC through two bitcoin mixers (services that ‘mix’ bitcoins to make them harder to track).  He had been tracking the coins, which he claimed were stolen, as they were sent to new wallet addresses. He sent 0.00666 BTC to each address he discovered, to mark them and let his target know he was watching.  This is an expensive statement – each of those deposits is worth over $6 and he sent them to tens of addresses.  “I think he's asleep now in the Czech republic. When he awakes, he will see my 666 next to his 96,000 stolen, freshly-laundered bitcoins,” said the redditor, named sheeproadreloaded2, who didn’t respond to a request for comment from CoinDesk. “Along with lots of insults attached to fragments of bitcoins that I hope you are about to send here.”  Blockchain.info  The link sheeproadreloaded2 posted displays the blockchain.info page for the address holding the bitcoins he tracked. Yesterday, bitcoin users began sending notes to the bitcoin address using blockchain.info, which allows for messages to be sent along with bitcoin transactions.  “Give up, send the coins back,” said one such message, attached to a 0.000007 BTC transaction.  Others claim Czech resident Tomáš Jiřikovský was behind the scam (throwme1121 claimed Sheep Market's owners were Czech in his original post).  The logic behind these allegations can be found in Branwen's reddit post, and a document he uploaded on Pastebin. However Jiřikovský and his girlfriend both issued a statement yesterday to deny ownership of the site.  Scalability concerns  The website Black Market Reloaded has also closed, citing scalability worries. Operator Blackopy commented in a forum post:  “SR is down, The Black Flag ended up as a scam, Atlantis ended up as a scam and now The Sheep Market follows that dark path.""  Backopy had previously shut down the site in October, following a security scare where the site's source code was published online. Now, Blackopy is promising a gradual shutdown of the site, pruning inactive accounts in the process. CPU load on the operator's servers spiked to 60%, which caused errors and technical problems for the marketplace, the site's operator said.  Silk Road 2.0 also suspended new registrations temporarily, as of Monday.  Scalability issues may affect the servers operated by each of these black market sites, but the Tor network on which they run is relatively small. According to Tor’s creator, Roger Dingledine, around 800,000 people use the network each day. He told CoinDesk:  “Most people use Tor to reach ordinary websites on the Internet, so one of the main constraints for most Tor users is the number and size of exit relays that volunteers around the Internet run.”  There are around 4750 relays on the Tor network. This powers a significant portion of the ‘dark web’ on which sites like Sheep and Black Market Reloaded operated.  “The media makes a big fuss about sites like these, but they make up a very small fraction of overall Tor use,” Dingledine added.

It closed a $2m round from prominent venture firm Founder's Fund in May. Competing firm Coinbase raised $5m in funding in the same month, with Union Square Ventures leading the investment round.  The biggest funding round to date was raised by a startup called Circle, which raised $9m last month to develop services that will accelerate adoption of bitcoin by merchants and their customers. The company hasn't officially announced its products yet, but it is likely to become a rival to payment processors like BitPay and end-to-end services like Coinbase.
