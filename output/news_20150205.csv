42377981,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Lj8J,1423178533,'Bad Blood' Between Ripple and Stellar Aired in Tell-All Report,"UPDATE (17th February, 2015 14:15 GMT): This article has been updated with new critiques of the New York Observer report.      The New York Observer has published a near 15,000-word story that takes a detailed look at the alleged historical ""bad blood"" between decentralized payment network startups Ripple Labs and Stellar, and the impact of this relationship on events in the wider bitcoin ecosystem.  “The interpersonal story of Stellar and Ripple Labs is emblematic of the turmoil roiling the entire industry,” the article, penned by Michael Craig, reads. “It has everything: sex, huge money, fraud, genius, betrayal, international intrigue and government raids.”  Of particular note are the story's main participants Jed McCaleb, the founder of now-defunct bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, Ripple Labs and Stellar, and Stellar executive director Joyce Kim who bear the brunt of the article's barbs.  The Observer reports that McCaleb and Kim have long had a personal relationship that complicated McCaleb’s relationship with other senior executives and board members at Ripple Labs, and ultimately lead McCaleb to leave that company and found competitor Stellar.  Also included in the report are allegations that hit home far beyond the companies themselves, as it suggests the feud at the two companies has had implications for mobile payments startup Stripe and banking giant Wells Fargo, among others.  Wells Fargo bitcoin unit collapses  Of all the details included in the report, however, none perhaps has greater relevance than the revelation that US banking giant Wells Fargo had assembled a task force compromising 20 of its “top executives and advisors” that was aimed at finding ways it could become the first bank to embrace cryptocurrency.  The report argues that due to a combination of the Mt Gox collapse, the closure of Silk Road and McCaleb’s personal track record, the unit was disbanded in 2014.  “Predictably, Wells got cold feet,” Craig writes. “At the bank, the crypto blackout was so severe that it extended not only to shutting the accounts that cleared funds for crypto companies, but even those companies’ operating accounts … were shut down.”  This includes the account held by Ripple Labs, whose CEO Chris Larsen, the paper said, had a more than 20-year relationship with the bank prior to the decision.  “The problem is your connection to Mr McCaleb,” Larsen was told, according to the report. “The guy founded Mt Gox. You’ve got to get that guy out of there or we won’t bank you.”  At the time, McCaleb was no longer with the company, but the report suggests even his association as a board member was “enough to make Wells Fargo skittish” and move ahead with the dismantling of its nascent cryptocurrency initiative.  Turbulent times at Ripple  Speaking to the Observer, Kraken CEO and Ripple Labs investor Jesse Powell indicated that he first introduced McCaleb and Kim, and that, before long, Ripple had purchased Kim’s company SimpleHoney and brought her into the team.  The Observer described her tenure as one that was not only rocky, but saw her attempting to play up her importance and that of McCaleb. Eventually, the report argues that Larsen needed to intervene.  “Chris sat her down and was like, ‘Joyce you’re a CEO. It’s going to be hard fitting in. You’re obviously reporting to me. Two cultures coming together is always a hard thing. Let’s talk about everything before we do it just to make sure everything is good.’ And Joyce just of course wouldn’t hear of it,” an insider said.  Kim is alleged as having a “Yoko Ono” role at the company, according to those who spoke to the report.  “This is Jed’s thing, when you’re in a private conversation with him all of a sudden Joyce is CC’d on this private conversation, even when the conversation includes the person saying, ‘I don’t want you to share this with Joyce.’ So not only does he disregard that request but he’s letting you know she knows you don’t like her,” another source said.  Kim’s tenure lasted only six weeks. McCaleb, the report contends, soon “lost interest” in the project.  Stripe deal squashed  The end result of the ensuing turmoil is that a deal that would have seen Ripple Labs purchased by Stripe for $13m in cash never came to pass. The Observer indicated it was unable to uncover an exact reason for the deal’s demise.  Yet, another sticking point however, was that most of the leadership team at Ripple Labs held significant holdings of its altcoin, XRP. McCaleb and Larsen, for example, both owned 9bn XRP, a factor that discouraged many in the wider bitcoin market from trusting the company.  At the time, Powell also sought to intervene to fix what he described as the company’s ongoing PR problem.  All of the problems came together, the report said, in a meeting in which McCaleb attempted to have Larsen removed from the company for reasons not disclosed.  Larsen kept his role, however, by a 5-1 vote, with McCaleb providing the dissenting voice.  “Every single person begged Jed not to make us choose between him and Chris,” said Roger Ver, a VC investor in Ripple Labs. “In the end, the vote was unanimous that Chris should stay. The only person who disagreed was Jed.”  Attacks on Stellar  McCaleb would go on to found Stellar, taking a $3m investment from Stripe, though the article questions the nature of the relationship between the companies.  For example, Stellar’s former head of community told the publication that the two companies are quite close, with everything Stellar does having to go through Stripe.  Still, Stripe’s relationship with Wells Fargo, the report suggested, has put limits on how close the two companies can publicly appear.  The report quoted those close to co-founder Patrick Collison as describing him as privately dismissive of banks, while highlighting the reliance the San Francisco-based payments company has on institutions like Wells Fargo.  The article went on to question Stellar's designation as a non-profit, arguing that tax experts believe this claim won’t hold up under regulatory scrutiny.  “Once the IRS pieces together how Stellar benefits McCaleb, Patrick Collison and any other insiders receiving STRs or fattening up in the initial distribution, it will likely find the venture inconsistent with the charitable purpose of the 501(c)(3) exemption,” the report reads.  Article’s accuracy questioned  Following the publication of the article, CoinDesk reached out to the parties involved for their take on the report and its implications.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, McCaleb indicated that the article failed to capture the facts of the story.  ""Given the vast amount of inaccuracies and innuendo in the article, it is not worth commenting on. The bias in the article is so obvious, no one can take it seriously,” he said.  Yet another complaint was lodged by Frank, Rimerman + Co. LLP, which argued quotes from an interview with representative Lisa Henderson were taken out of context.  ""We are deeply concerned comments of a general nature have been quoted without proper context, creating an impression that Ms. Henderson had access to relevant documents or was in a position to judge Stellar’s specific transactions or business model when this is not the case,"" the agency said.  Additional criticism centered on the article's portrayal of Kim, with co-founder of Freestyle Josh Felser weighing in with his experience as her colleague and hiring manager.  ""[Kim] worked at Freestyle for over six months and departed on excellent terms. This information is quite easy to verify since she met with hundreds of entrepreneurs during that time period,"" he said.  VC investor Jeremy Liew, managing director at Lightspeed Venture Partners, has also stated he has ""no recollection"" of the comments he made regarding Kim in the article.  CoinDesk reached out to Kim and Ripple Labs for comment, but has not received an immediate response.  Correction (11:18 6th February 2015): This article previously indicated that Stripe was a 501(c)(3) non-profit. In fact Stellar is the non-profit. The error has now been corrected.

42377979,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LjC5,1423175412,BitShares Rebranding Signals New Communication Strategy,"One of the earliest and most ambitious projects in the digital currency ecosystem, BitShares has sometimes struggled to communicate its message even to bitcoin’s relatively niche community of enthusiasts.  Take for example the introduction needed for the project itself and what it hopes will become its signature product, the BitShares decentralized exchange.  Formerly operated by Invictus Innovations, the BitShares exchange is a product of BitShares X, a decentralised autonomous company (DAC) that specializes in the creation of BitAssets like BitUSD and BitCNY that are pegged to the BitShares blockchain. Both are digital assets and are backed by enough shares of the company (BTSX) to equal $1 or ¥1, or say the price of gold.  Given this explanation it may be no surprise that the BitShares Wiki’s ‘Explain Like I’m Five’ section scores about a 56 on the Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease score, putting it on about a 12-year-old’s reading level.  If its message sounds a bit complicated, project leader Daniel Larimer is at least aware of this. That’s why at the start of 2015, he’s seeking to reintroduce his brand to the community and wider public through a newly launched website that positions its combined solutions as ones that can offer real savings to businesses and consumers.  The goal of BitShares, he explained, is to become a full e-commerce platform that allows merchants and customers to trade within a larger ecosystem, one that today brings added costs every time consumers perform a key service with a different provider.  Larimer told CoinDesk:  ”Right now, businesses take bitcoin and immediately have to sell it for dollars and every time someone converts there’s a spread and a premium. If you buy something with bitcoin, you pay a 1%–2% spread, and when you buy the good, the merchant has to charge you to get back to dollars.”  Larimer is confident the company can send out a new message, especially as he believes the market is now waking up to the limitations bitcoin may face seeking to achieve its full potential.  “If you want to trade bitcoin, our exchange is where it’s at,” Larimer said. “A merchant will be able to accept payment in 10 seconds without having to have a Coinbase or a BitPay, and they’ll earn interest in BitUSD until they decide to cash out.""  Eliminating counterparty risk  The key difference between BitShares and more well-touted alternatives, according to Larimer, is that BitShares uses collateral, the shares of its own DAC, to back the assets on its exchange. He argues this means that this value can be reclaimed under a wider range of conditions.  Larimer said that the BTSX shares operate in a different way to Ripple’s native tokens, XRP, comparing them to IOUs or promises that Ripple or its competitors will deliver the value when a redemption is requested.  By removing this risk, Larimer contends that this adds up to a system that perhaps shares more in common with bitcoin’s original vision than other alternatives, which he argues serve as unnecessary third parties.  “If the company dies or the people running it disappears, the token is worthless,” Larmier said. “With BitUSD, the collateral behind is not controlled by any one person, it cannot be seized, there is no private key that can be compromised, no bank account that can be robbed.”  Further, Larimer said, those who hold a BitAsset like BitUSD receive interest for doing so, a benefit for holding BTSX and exposing oneself to that market risk.  Of course, should a company like Ripple cease to operate, its token is still an open-source digital currency, meaning the token would need to be continued by the market, which may no longer have an incentive to do so.  Message sinking in  In this light, Larimer considers BitShares most in line with the original goals of bitcoin, to create a self-propagating network, though he argues BitShares is built to be self-funding and self-governing.  By design, BitShares is a DAC, a term coined by Larimer that means a set of business rules that govern the company running on a blockchain. The shareholders are, in turn, those who own BTSX shares.  Still, while Larimer believes in bitcoin’s underlying ethos, he’s been an outspoken critic of the network, critiquing its proof-of-work mining network and likening it to an unprofitable company.  Larimer suggests that recent news has provided validation for his views.  “It seems like it’s finally sunk in with the bitcoin price decline, and the miners turning off. People are realizing, ‘Hey, mining is actually an expense,’” Larimer said.  Larimer’s remarks also hinted at the growing public enthusiasm for blockchain technologies, and the simultaneous rise in complaints about bitcoin’s mining network in the media.  Market interest on the way  As for why BitShares technology hasn’t translated into partnerships with businesses in the ecosystem, Larimer argued that alternatives haven’t been widely adopted either, and that supporting any crypto 2.0 protocol is a tall development task for startups.  “We’ve talked to everyone from Coinbase to Bitstamp to BitPay, half a dozen others, and they all want to integrate with us, it’s just a schedule priority issue,” Larimer said.  As for whether BitShares has succeeded where he believes bitcoin is failing, Larimer said that BitShares is right now generating enough revenue to pay for development via inflation.  “If you actually look at our share supply, it’s gone down from it’s all-time high, so we are profitable in that sense,” he said.  Looking at the year ahead, BitShares plans to focus on launching products like BitGold and BitSilver while releasing a light wallet that Larimer believes is a game-changer for 2.0 that will help his project succeed on its vision.  Still, he believes 2015 will be a turbulent year, one that separates strong ideas from the weak.  “I suspect that by the end of 2015, there’s going to be three major players, bitcoin, Ripple and us, as far as blockchain technologies go,” he said.

42377970,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LizV,1423150844,Italian Central Bank: No AML Requirement for Bitcoin Exchanges,"Digital currency exchanges in Italy are not required to enforce anti-money laundering policies, according to the country's central bank.  Banca d'Italia issued three notices on 30th January advising financial institutions not to hold or deal in digital currencies in the absence of a regulatory regime.  However, one of the notices, from the bank's Financial Intelligence Unit, clarified that businesses dealing in the exchange of digital and fiat currencies are not required to comply with anti-money laundering rules.  ""The use, exchange and storage of digital currencies and their conversion to legal currencies are not addressed by the money-laundering legislation and therefore are not required to comply with requirements of customer data recording and reporting of suspicious transactions,"" the notice says.  However, the bank did strongly encourage firms dealing in digital currency exchange to voluntarily apply AML rules.  The bank's overall position is in line with statements about digital currencies made by the European Banking Authority last July and first set out by the European Central Bank in December 2012.  Following the EBA line  The Italian central bank's statement has been cautiously welcomed by cryptocurrency businesses and activists in the country.  Andrea Medri, who founded cryptocurrency exchange The Rock Trading in Italy, said he was pleasantly surprised by the tone of the central bank's guidance, but only because he expected more negative rhetoric.  ""When we talk about central banks we always expect the worse, but in my opinion it is not as bad as it could have been,"" he said. ""We are cautiously optimistic.""  Medri said the latest announcements did not contain any explicit new guidance for firms like his, although he welcomed the fact that the central bank appeared to be building on guidance from European regulators.  The central bank's latest guidance should be viewed as a positive development for the cryptocurrency industry in Italy, said Giulia Aranguena, a lawyer who advises Cashless Way, an association that promotes digital payments.  ""This is a very good first step for our market to organise and give a sort of certainty, it is very positive ... indirectly it is recognising the role and importance of digital currencies,"" she said.  Mixed response from entrepreneurs  The Rock Trading's founder said he is particularly interested in regulatory movements surrounding bitcoin in Italy because he had moved his firm to Malta and is seeking to return to Italy if the regulatory environment becomes more settled.  The entrepreneur said his exchange implemented voluntary AML and know-your-customer rules a year ago, so the latest announcements would have had no impact on his operations, even if still based in Italy.  Italian law-makers are actively engaged with the cryptocurrency community, but are likely awaiting guidelines from European authorities before making further moves, Medri said.  ""I believe, eventually, Italy will require the equivalent of a money-transmitter's licence in the United States, and I hope they will create a dedicated licence for [the digital currency] industry,"" he said.  Other market-watchers agree with Medri's assessment that Italian regulators are likely waiting for European authorities' cue.  One such observer is Franco Cimatti of Bitcoin Foundation Italy, a trade organisation that is not affiliated with the Bitcoin Foundation. He warns that the central bank's latest guidance should be viewed critically because local legislators are far from agreement on how digital currencies should be governed.  ""Even if this seems like good news, it will not stop our politicians from creating bad laws. We are still keeping our eyes wide open to see what will happen in the future,"" he said.

42377976,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Lj9Z,1423148348,Students Build Database to Fight Bitcoin Fraud,"A group of students and staff from Trinity College Dublin, which is developing a tradition of research into crypto projects, is building a bitcoin 'credit check' database to make the digital currency more transparent.      The team, led by Professor Donal O'Mahony, is hoping that the database will enable potential business partners to identify possible indicators for fraudulent business practices or money laundering, whilst still granting sufficient anonymity.      O'Mahony said:      ""We have been watching the progress of bitcoin and have been fascinated by the market uptake, the uses people have put it to, but we've also been struck by how little is known about what is actually going on at a transaction level.""            Building a big picture    ""Even though the [bitcoin] system is designed not to be regulated,"" said O'Mahony, ""it would give people some comfort if there was a way to build a big picture of what was going on. Identifying fraudsters and helping people to avoid them would also be a useful thing.""      To that end, the team is trying to group bitcoin addresses together into clusters, by correlating the addresses used to make payments with those that were used to receive change. This knowledge is then combined into a database of bitcoin addresses, to enable the team to link an address to a pocket of fraudulent activity.      The bitcoin database is currently working in a lab setting, but O'Mahony says that they are ""continuing to break new ground,"" adding that he would ""not be surprised if one or more of [the students] saw a business opportunity"".

Like the Dublin work, BitIodine ""parses the blockchain, clusters addresses that are likely to belong to a same user or group of users, classifies and labels them and finally visualises complex information extracted from the bitcoin network"".  He pointed out that ""the main difference between my work and that currently being carried out in Dublin is that I do not mean to evaluate good and bad actors in the bitcoin network"". Instead he hopes BitIodine will become ""the skeleton for building more complex frameworks for bitcoin forensic analysis"".",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Yessi Bello Perez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/02/05/students-build-database-to-fight-bitcoin-fraud,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8bed3293bd7a38ad762af0703e6d87454e025f76-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42377980,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LjDL,1423111841,Turmoil at GAW Miners Spreads to Subsidiary Phone Service,"UPDATE (5th February 19:30 BST): This piece has been updated with comments and information from several Easthampton, MA businesses affected by the phone outage. Reports indicate at least one company affected by the outage is now seeing service restoration.      Customers of GAW High Speed Internet, an Internet and phone services provider operated by the parent company of controversial bitcoin startup GAW Miners, are reporting service issues.  The development is notable as GAW's phone customers aren't the only ones experiencing disruptions to their service. The news comes amid reports of SEC investigations into GAW Miners, senior staff exits and the potential resignation of GAW Miners CEO Josh Garza, suggesting the service interruptions may also be indicative of broader operational issues at the parent company.  PayBase customers have been reporting issues on Hash Talk, GAW's community forum, in recent weeks. For example, the company locked users out of PayBase after the launch of a planned gift card service and an internal market crash that followed on 18th January, an incident which sent the price of paycoin plunging. GAW Miners also recently announced the shutdown of its ZenCloud cloud mining platform.  Both GAW High Speed Internet and GAW Miners are subsidiaries of Geniuses At Work Corp, and the Internet service and phone provider is owned by GAW Miners investor and Cantor Fitzgerald vice chairman Stuart Fraser.  Garza, who serves as chief executive for GAW Miners and cryptocurrency platform PayBase, also acts as CEO of both GAW High Speed Internet, according to the Better Business Bureau, as well as GAW Corp.  Small businesses impacted  Platterpus Records  of Easthampton, Massachusetts, has been experiencing phone problems since at least 22nd January, taking to both Twitter and Facebook to report issues it says are shared by other area customers.  Indications that customers of GAW were experiencing phone problems surfaced on 22nd January, when Platterpus took to Twitter to alert its followers about the phone issues.

Witthaus said that he had been reaching out GAW customer service representatives daily since the disruptions began, but received no indication that services would be restored, explaining:  ""No phones and absolutely no explanation. To add insult to injury while this is going on, of course, they send out their bills via email. So obviously they've got our email address.""  Witthaus suggested that GAW was originally seen as a viable alternative to larger ISPs that service the Western Massachusetts region, but that businesses in the area that received phone service encountered routine issues with connectivity and customer service. He remarked that at least one other business in the area that worked with GAW had shifted to another ISP as a result of the outage.  ""They could have done well in this area but the customer service has just been awful,"" he said. ""And now, two weeks without phone is just unacceptable.""  Marlies Stoddard of Nash Gallery reported similar experiences, and said that the outage led to confusion among gallery visitors and customers during a time when she was on vacation. Jared Quinn, who runs Harry King Rug & Home out of the same building, told CoinDesk that the disruption has had a material impact on his business.  A representative for GAW reportedly told Quinn that the outage was a result of a server issue, and according to Quinn, a promised service restoration for 4th February didn't occur. Quinn was later told that a fire at the call center he spoke with led to further delays.  ""No one has called me back,"" he said. ""I'm losing business.""  Rising criticism  GAW has faced a rising tide of public criticism following a string of delays and platform problems, including perhaps most notably, its decision to abandon a plan to stabilize the price of its bitcoin competitor paycoin at $20.  The move was followed by the last-minute postponement of a proposed buyback that would have seen customers be reimbursed for purchases at this value. At press time, the value of 1 paycoin is $1.03.  CEO Josh Garza also recently canceled a much-anticipated speaking appearance at The North American Bitcoin Conference (TNABC) Miami, citing issues with the launch of the company's planned gift card service PayFlash that weekend.  The cancelation sparked confusion and derision from both within the GAW Miners community and the digital currency ecosystem at large as the forum was meant to address longstanding questions about the company's business practices, as well as its future.  CoinDesk has reached out to GAW but did not receive an immediate response.  CoinDesk will continue to provide updates as the story develops.
