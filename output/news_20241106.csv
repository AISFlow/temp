35820233,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651882,1730934057,"Not Dogecoin But This Altcoin Is the Best Pick Post-Trump Win, Says Crypto CEO","Andrew Kang, founder and CEO of Mechanism Capital, has shifted his bullish outlook from Dogecoin (DOGE) to First Neiro On Ethereum (NEIRO) following Donald Trump’s landslide victory in the US presidential election. In a series of posts on X on Wednesday, November 6, Kang asserted that NEIRO is poised for exponential growth in the coming months. Better Than Dogecoin? “With a Trump win, NEIRO as the natural successor to Doge is on a path to billions over the next few months,” Kang wrote. He further elaborated, “Hard to think of better coins to hold post a Trump/Elon win than NEIRO. As the natural successor to Doge, its path to a Doge/Shib like run and eventual flippening debates are pre-ordained. Doge is great, but new dogs are even better.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Record Largest Accumulation Week Since January With 2.10 Billion Tokens Bought Kang was among the first industry experts to designate Dogecoin as the premier “Trump trade” in the crypto market—a strategy for investors betting on a Trump victory. On October 15, he noted: “One of the most interesting ways to express a ‘Trump Victory’ trade would probably be owning DOGE (and other memes). Not only do you have high odds of a Doge ETF but the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) would be making headlines every week and be pushed forward by Trump.” This perspective gained traction among several crypto analysts who identified Dogecoin as the leading proxy for anticipating a Trump win. The association stems from Elon Musk’s proposal to lead a “Department of Government Efficiency” (D.O.G.E.) under a Trump administration to reduce the bloated US government spending. Since Kang’s initial post on October 15, the Dogecoin price has surged by over 70%, climbing from $0.1158 to above $0.20 at press time. In contrast, NEIRO experienced a significant downturn of approximately 22% during the same period. After reaching its all-time high of $0.002333 on October 15, NEIRO dipped but has recently shown signs of recovery, rising 42% in the last 48 hours to trade at $0.001786. Related Reading: Why Is Dogecoin Going Up Today? Key Drivers Of DOGE’s 10% Surge Kang’s endorsement of NEIRO has sparked a debate within the crypto community. Crypto analyst Crypto Stream (@CryptoStreamHub) questioned the trend of industry leaders promoting meme coins, commenting under Kang’s post: “When did it become normalized for the industry leaders to shill Memecoins, honest question? Raoul Pal started, yesterday I heard Arthur Hayes shill GOAT and now Kang is shilling NEIRO. Not wanna criticize that, I genuinely wonder when we made the pivot.” Another analyst, CryptoGugu (@Silivabrota), expressed skepticism about NEIRO’s potential and warned of an underlying market manipulation: “Guys please stop comparing NEIRO with DOGE. DOGE is the real deal NEIRO looking more like a liquidity grab scheme right now. Since the mm has been replaced chart looking awful. Mm only going up and down chasing liquidity, whales only dumping. Something needs to change asap or NEIRO will continue bleeding.” At press time, NEIRO traded at $0.001786.

The violent crypto rally triggered $592 million in liquidations of leveraged derivatives trading positions across all crypto assets during the day, CoinGlass data shows. The majority, some $390 million of the liquidations were leveraged shorts betting on lower prices, making the largest short squeeze in at least the past six months.  Crypto stocks also joined the rally, led by crypto exchange Coinbase's (COIN) 31% advance. Bitcoin miners Riot Platforms (RIOT), TeraWulf (WULF) and CleanSpark (CLSK) were up 20%-25%, too.  The action happened amid a risk-on day with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 climbing 3% and 2.5%, respectively, following Trump's decisive win in the U.S. elections.

SOL has recently experienced a 14% increase, which has enabled it to surpass BNB. Related Reading: Why One Analyst Says Now’s The Time To Buy XRP—Before It Hits $14 This represents an emerging market momentum of Solana. According to Coingecko, the market capitalization of Solana has reached over $87 billion in comparison to that of Binance Coin at almost the $84 billion mark. Thus, this shows the emergence of Solana’s strong appeal to investors. Solana’s most recent ascent has brought it into the limelight, prompting crypto devotees and analysts to contemplate whether this represents a new era for the network. Despite a nearly 4% increase in BNB during the same period, Solana’s rapid recovery and robust community support have eclipsed its rival. Increasing User Engagement and Activity Apart from market size, active participation and complete information on-chain have raised Solana’s price. The network just noted a historic first: 123 million active monthly addresses in October, up 40% from September. According to the latest data, active addresses increased month by month displaying participation and confidence in the promise Solana presented. According to the real-time economic activity reports by Blockworks Research, transaction fees and MEV tips recently peaked at a new all-time-high figure of $11 million on October 24th. These values have remained much above past ones, even though they have fallen somewhat lately. Particularly from regular users and small-scale transactions, the higher use and engagement show the dynamic character of Solana’s ecosystem and its capacity to draw each daily players. Memecoins Add To The Frenzy The memecoin mania has taken off within its network, thereby amplifying trading volume and attracting more users, which has contributed to Solana’s rally. Pump.fun, a memecoin generator, and Raydium, a decentralized exchange, have received substantial attention. Pump.fun generated $30 million in revenue in October. On the other hand, Raydium’s trading volume exceeded $30 billion. Memecoins have been a significant factor in the recent growth of Solana, as a growing number of users are flocking to these platforms to trade or generate meme-based tokens. The emergence of these niche areas has heightened the enthusiasm surrounding Solana, illustrating its adaptability as a blockchain that accommodates both mainstream and unconventional projects.

According to a research by Messari, the Solana decentralized finance ecosystem is experiencing growth in terms of value locked (TVL), reaching $5.8 billion in Q3 2024. This is a 25% increase from the previous quarter, which propelled Solana to the position of third largest network by TVL.

Well maybe they don't know about all the INCREDIBLE CONTENT we have assembled in this week's The Protocol newsletter? There's even an ongoing election to keep you entertained.  FEATURING:  U.S. election coverage roundup: Trump wins, Gensler loses, bitcoin jumps.  It's make-or-break for Maker's 'Sky' rebrand.  Ethereum Foundation researchers renounce paid EigenLayer gigs.  Trump family-backed crypto project World Liberty Financial cuts fundraising target by 90%.  Hullabaloo over token listing fees.  Crypto commercials evolve past ""total cringe.""

Top picks from the past week's Protocol Village column: Pundi AI, MultiversX, Privado ID, River, Llama, Towns, SheFi.  Network news  U.S. ELECTION COVERAGE HIGHLIGHTS:  Trump's Triumph Is Also Crypto's: Gensler, Regulatory Clouds Likely to Vanish  SEC Chair Gensler, Crypto Regulatory Hawk, Likely Heading for Door  Crypto-Friendly Senate Banking Committee Expected Under Trump: Bernstein  Polymarket, Prediction Betting Markets Vindicated by Trump's Strong Showing  Bitcoin Unlikely to See Big 'Sell-The-Fact' Price Drop: Omkar Godbole  POLLS STILL OPEN: In another vote taking place, not due to close for several more hours, community members of the DeFi project MakerDAO are expressing their opinions on what to do with the Sky brand. As reported in The Protocol last month, the project formerly known as Maker rebranded to Sky in August, but the move received a lukewarm reception, and now holders of the MKR tokens are being asked to weigh in on whether a de-rebranding should be considered. As reported by CoinDesk's Sam Reynolds, the poll is not binding. Early participation was quite limited.  MEA CULPA, TABULA RASA: Ethereum Foundation researchers Dankrad Feist and Justin Drake have resigned from their advisory roles at EigenLayer, months after a controversy erupted over potential conflicts of interest within the Ethereum community. In the spring, Drake and Feist publicly confirmed that they had each accepted advisory roles with EigenLayer. Each researcher was allotted a significant sum of EIGEN tokens in exchange for helping guide the upcoming project and its roadmap. “While I believe that the role was negotiated in good faith and with the aim of making sure that EigenLayer is well aligned with Ethereum,” Feist said in an X post, “I understand that the perception of this relationship has been different and that for many the conflict of interest this creates is difficult to reconcile with my role as an Ethereum researcher.”  TRUE CONCESSION: It turns out that making money in crypto isn't quite as easy as it might seem: Crypto buyers, burned so many times over the years, are quite leery of newcomers — and skeptical when it comes to examining new token offerings. That appears to be the case for World Liberty Financial, the crypto project backed by former President and now President-Elect Donald Trump and his sons, Don Jr. and Eric. As detailed in The Protocol last month, project officials initially talked up their big plans, with a fundraising goal of $300 million, and released a ""Gold Paper"" with lots of fine print, including the revelation that the initial $30 million of ""net protocol revenues"" would be set aside to cover expenses, indemnities and obligations. The rest would go to a company called ""DT Marks DEFI LLC,"" whose owners and principals include Donald Trump. But sales of the tokens never passed $15 million. As scooped last week by CoinDesk's Danny Nelson, the project now has made a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission saying that the sales will be terminated as soon as the $30 million target is reached. The concession to market realities could put an end to the bizarre effort, which left many analysts scratching their heads at how Trump had time to promote a crypto project while in the throes of an intense campaign for president.  ALSO:  Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong's claim in a post on X that listings on the U.S. crypto exchange are ""free"" drew protests from project leaders including Sonic Labs' Andre Cronje and Tron's Justin Sun. Bitget, a rival crypto exchange, took advantage of the topic's salience to open a new listing application portal on its platform, stating that it's ""transparent about its listing procedures and thrives to provide token projects with the ease of exposure at best possible initial investments for its community,"" along with the following testament: ""Importantly, Bitget strongly emphasizes that it does not charge any fees related to the listing application process, such as commission fees, brokerage fees, application fees or assessment fees. Tokens provided by project teams will be fully allocated to Bitget users based on the agreed-upon marketing and promotional plan.""  SPICY SPOTS: Crypto commercials have come a long way since Crypto.com's notoriously cringe-y ""Fortune Favors the Brave"" ad starring Matt Damon. A couple videos circulating this week actually approached the not-inconsiderable triple-achievement of ""surprisingly clever"" and ""refreshingly dark"" while remaining ""uncannily crypto-native.""  Here's one from Solana poking fun at other unspecified blockchains' penchant for ""infra"" buildout:  And here was one promoting the Polygon Labs-sponsored AggLayer, comparing various blockchain ecosystems to a series of dysfunctional couples undergoing therapy.  Is Optimism's 'Superchain' Winning the Ethereum Layer-2 Race?  Optimism Foundation Chief Growth Officer Ryan Wyatt (Optimism Foundation)  One of the biggest trends of 2023 among the leading layer-2 projects on Ethereum was the emergence of “blockchain in a box,” where the teams encouraged developers to clone their code to spin up new layer 2s.  Now, one project in particular appears to be pulling away as the clear leader. And as is often the case in blockchain development, a crucial factor is the money changing hands behind the scenes.  Optimism, one of the major layer-2 networks, has managed to get a slew of clients and firms to deploy their own blockchains using Optimism’s technology, with the OP Stack, under open-source software licenses.  It's a crucial development in the evolution of the broader blockchain universe, since layer-2 networks stand at the heart of developers' efforts to make transactions faster and cheaper in the Ethereum ecosystem.  Part of the Optimism Foundation's strategy to get new networks to use their technology is to giveout large sums of OP tokens in the form of grants.  Ultimately, the goal is to reach critical mass — perhaps not unlike the ascendance in the 1980s of VHS over Betamax as the dominant videotape technology.

The report suggests that memecoins' combined share of the altcoin market has doubled from 2023 levels to about 11% currently. (See chart above.)  There was also this high-minded takeaway, flicking at an increasingly common refrain heard, a backlash against the idea of venture capital-backed projects using retail investors as exit liquidity:  ""Projects have turned towards private VC funding rounds in order to raise capital. This practice has grown significantly in recent years, leading to an industry wide ‘Low Float, High FDV,’"" the report reads. ""A symptom of this problem is that many of the new altcoins with the most exciting narratives and visions now face significant supply unlocks in the coming years, effectively turning retail traders into potential exit liquidity for VCs that got into early stage private rounds. This tokenomics problem created by the prominence of private token sale rounds is likely one of the factors at the forefront of the market’s shift towards the fair launch, transparent memecoins.""  Ranking Node-as-a-Service Providers  Top 16 providers of native staking, as ranked on assets-under-management by the website Staking Rewards (Staking Rewards)  Earlier this week I had a fascinating conversation with Pablo Larguia, co-founder and CEO of Buenos Aires-based SenseiNode, a provider of institutional grade staking-as-a-service — essentially operating blockchain nodes on behalf of big investors.  The fast-growing business involves taking non-custodial token allocations and then managing the mostly data-center-oriented business of running nodes and staking on behalf of third parties.  This activity appears to fall somewhere between the proof-of-stake equivalent of bitcoin mining and the 21st century version of a bond manager.  Larguia showed us how to find the industry-standard rankings for this cottage industry within the blockchain space. It involves first going to the tracking website Staking Rewards and then filtering for ""native staking."" P2P.org is tops with $6.12 billion of assets under management, followed by Kiln at No. 2 with $4.91 billion, then Allnodes with $3.89 billion and stakefish with $2.6 billion. SenseiNode is No. 14 at $859.6 million, for what it's worth.  Protocol Village  Top picks of the past week from our Protocol Village column, highlighting key blockchain tech upgrades and news.

Key U.S. stock indexes ended at record highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJI ) soared +1,508 points, or +3.6% , to 43,729.93. The Nasdaq Composite ( COMP:IND ) +3%, and the S&P 500 ( SP500 ) +2.5%. Equities leapt as Trump secured the 270 electoral votes required to win the U.S. presidency over Vice President Kamala Harris. Republicans took control of the Senate, but were still fighting Democratic Party candidates to hang onto the House of Representatives. “Markets love certainty and with what appears to be a sweep (in U.S. government), markets are getting certainty from that. You're starting to see, especially higher-risk assets like small caps and growth-oriented names, really taking off,” Jeff DeLarme, president of DeLarme Wealth Management, told Seeking Alpha in an interview Wednesday. The Russell 2000 ( RTY ) measure of small-cap stocks reached roughly three-year highs by climbing +5.9% . The U.S. Dollar Index ( DXY ) +1.7% to 105.10. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) soared past the $76K level for the first time ever. Eight of 11 sectors in the S&P 500 ( SP500 ) rose. The Financials sector +6.2% . ""This upside is driven in part by optimism that the Trump Administration will usher in lower regulation for banks and other financial firms,"" Daniel Jones , investing group leader of Crude Value Insights, told Seeking Alpha. The real Estate, Consumer Staples and Utilities sectors each slid. In the bond market, the 30-year yield ( US30Y ) was up 18 basis points at 4.66% as Treasury announced the results of its $25B auction of the bonds. The high yield was 4.608% vs. 4.389% at October's sale. The bid-to-cover ratio rose to 2.64 from 2.50. The yield earlier Wednesday hit 4.660%, the highest since late May. Other Treasury yields also spiked up as prices dropped. The benchmark 10-year yield ( US10Y ) was up 15 basis points to 4.44%, and the shorter-end, more rate-sensitive 2-year yield ( US2Y ) was up 9 basis points to 4.29%. “Just looking at today, because of this certainty [in election results] I think the market is picking up on, it seems like that might bode well for the economy – meaning that rates are going to have to climb higher to incent fixed-income investors to forgo making equity investments or other projects,” DeLarme said. Most of the Magnificent 7 group of tech behemoths including Nvidia ( NVDA ) and Alphabet ( GOOG ) rose. Shares of Tesla ( TSLA ) +14.7% , with the EV maker, led by Trump campaign supporter Elon Musk, seen as a major beneficiary under the Trump administration. Traders will next throw their attention to the Federal Reserve's meeting that concludes Thursday. Expectations are still a near-certainty of a quarter-point rate cut. But the odds of a similar cut in December have fallen below 70%, according to the CME FedWatch tool . Looking further out, fewer cuts are priced in for 2025, with traders now betting on a terminal rate for that year of 3.75%, just 1 full percentage point from current levels, reached by June. If President-elect Trump ""does end up proceeding with some of his more radical proposals, such as implementing large tariffs on most or all imports, that could lead to slower interest rate cuts and a meaningful rise in cost for the average taxpayer,"" Jones said. ""But for now, those concerns are not terribly important to the market."" Among other individual movers, Super Micro Computer ( SMCI ) dropped -18% after the embattled artificial intelligence server maker reported preliminary fiscal first-quarter results and offered up an update from its independent special committee.

42407312,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZAW3W,1730927384,How This Crypto Hedge Fund Nailed the Trump Trade,"Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election by a landslide.  Whereas polls indicated the race was a tossup, crypto hedge fund Lekker Capital went full-in on the Republican candidate.  The fund’s founder, Quinn Thompson, told CoinDesk how he came about his non-consensus view.  Former President and now President-elect Donald Trump’s landslide victory in the U.S. election shocked many, but not Quinn Thompson.  The founder of crypto hedge fund Lekker Capital has been publicly bullish on Trump since at least mid-March and remained steadfast even as the market vacillated. He positioned his fund accordingly going into Tuesday's election — he bought solana {{SOL}} and bitcoin {{BTC}} miners involved with artificial intelligence — despite a multitude of polls claiming that the race was a toss-up or that Vice President Kamala Harris was in the lead.  The result? It has been Lekker’s most successful trade since the fund was launched six months ago, Thompson told CoinDesk. He declined to give exact numbers. SOL has surged 13% in the last 24 hours and isn't far from multi-year highs. AI-related bitcoin miners such as Core Scientific (CORZ), Hut 8 (HUT) and HIVE (HIVE) are up roughly 10% Wednesday, while BTC is soaring 8.7% and hit a new all-time high of $75,600.  “It's difficult for investors to take public stances because politics is such a divisive topic. Just like how it's taboo to talk about it with strangers,” Thompson said, before adding that herein lies the appeal of investing in a hedge fund that focuses on macroeconomics.  “People invest in macro-driven strategies because they are non-consensus by requirement,” Thompson wrote in a Wednesday email to his fund’s investors. “In order to get paid for being correct in macro, it requires going against the grain for long periods of time and developing conviction on ideas that at times strongly go against popular opinions.”  Trump won the Electoral College and popular vote, but that’s not all: Republicans now control the Senate and may well keep control of the House of Representatives — giving them the presidency and all of Congress. For Thompson, that’s a clear mandate for a socially liberal but fiscally conservative government — one that is bound to make life easier for the crypto sector after the impediments posed by current President Joe Biden as well as Trump during his first term. Trump reversed course on crypto this year, vowing to make the U.S. a crypto leader.  Read more: Trump Backs U.S. Bitcoin Reserve and Says Democrat Win Will Be Disaster for Crypto: 'Every One of You Will Be Gone'  “This is one of the most monumental days in the history of crypto. The industry has been vehemently opposed by the most powerful entity in the world — the U.S. government — for four years straight and the target of many partisan political agendas as a result,” Thompson told CoinDesk. “Not only has that been lifted in real-time to be more neutral, but we've overnight moved to a stance of adoption and embrace,” Thompson added. “This team understands the industry and [its] potential and plans to fully harness that. It is simply impossible to price in the positive knock-on effects of this overnight.”  How did he do it?  There’s a few reasons why Thompson bet on Trump.  One of them was voter preference — the economy, immigration and foreign policy were at the top of the priority list for most voters in 2024, compared to the pandemic and racial inequality in 2020. Harris was vulnerable to these issues due to the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, the bout of inflation that occurred early in Biden’s term and the administration’s policies regarding illegal migrants.  Thompson also predicted that Democrats would face turnout issues due to a lack of enthusiasm for Harris, who only entered the race in July after Biden dropped out, while Republicans would be optimistic about their candidate.  That’s not to say that everything went perfectly. Thompson said he failed to take profits on portions of the trade before the late October pullback, which saw bitcoin fall from $72,000 to $67,000 after Trump’s odds of winning dropped from 65% to 55% on Polymarket.  “Last minute outlier/wrong polls made people second-guess and become very fearful and uncertain,” he said.",POSITIVE,BTC | SOL,BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | SOL | TRADING,Tom Carreras,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/06/how-this-crypto-hedge-fund-nailed-the-trump-trade,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fbbfa41073aac27a0beab23b34951d261bad5d92-1536x864.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Interestingly, this spike has come amid reignited interest in the SHIB price. This surge in activity cuts across the wider industry as traders look to capitalize on the election dynamics. Aside from Shiba Inu, Dogecoin has also witnessed a surge in trading activity and volume, and it is left to wonder if SHIB will rally alongside the Dogecoin price and reach new all-time highs. Shiba Inu Burn Rate Soars The burn rate of Shiba Inu is a measure of how much SHIB is permanently removed from circulation by sending it to inactive wallets. This controlled reduction of supply is intended to create scarcity, thereby potentially boosting SHIB’s price. Related Reading: Analyst Reveals What The Gold Chart Says About The Possibility Of Bitcoin Price Reaching $100,000 According to data from Shibburn.com, SHIB’s burn rate jumped by over 3,674% as voters trooped to vote in the US, an unexpected surge that points to a coordinated effort by the SHIB community. Particularly, Shibburn highlighted that over 53.3 million SHIB tokens were burned in the past 24 hours alone. Interestingly, a further look into the data shows that over 28.8 million SHIB tokens were burned in a single transaction. This uptick in SHIB burns has paralleled a notable increase in its market value, with SHIB climbing as high as 10% in the past 24 hours. This allowed SHIB to go on successive breaks above the $0.000017, $0.000018, $0.000019, and $0.000020 in rapid succession. Despite the notable Shiba Inu price uptick, its meme coin counterpart, Dogecoin, has witnessed more gains. Particularly, Dogecoin is up by about 20% in the last 24 hours, having recently crossed above $0.2 again for the first time since April 2024. Can SHIB Continue To Surge Alongside Dogecoin? Historically, both Shiba Inu and Dogecoin have seen simultaneous price movements, particularly when interest in one coin flows into higher trading volumes for the other. SHIB’s recent burn rate spike adds fuel to the debate over which token might lead in upcoming rallies, especially with DOGE seeing a sustained rise in interest. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Marks Local Bottom, Can Price Run 100% From Here Again? However, as both SHIB and DOGE continue to experience heightened trading activity, both cryptocurrencies are expected to continue on the upswing for the rest of the month. As such, we could see SHIB creating a new 2024 high alongside Dogecoin in November, before both eventually go to challenge their all-time highs. Both SHIB and DOGE have seen slight pullbacks after their recent rallies, likely due to profit-taking as some holders lock in gains before the next possible upswing. At the time of writing, SHIB has found support at $0.0000183, currently trading around $0.0000188, while Dogecoin is holding steady at $0.197 Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BTC | DOGE | FIAT | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-burn-rate-3674/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

42407328,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZAWA8,1730920245,"Polymarket Projects a GOP House, Clinching Trump Trifecta","Polymarket, the crypto-based prediction market whose rise this year was vindicated by the presidential election results, is now signaling that the Republicans will almost certainly retain control of the House of Representatives.  As of Wednesday afternoon in New York, ""Democratic"" shares for Polymarket's ""House control after 2024 election?"" contract were trading at 1 cent, indicating traders see only a 1% chance of the party taking back the chamber. Each share pays out $1 (in USDC, a stablecoin, or cryptocurrency that usually trades one-for-one with dollars) if the prediction comes true, and zilch if not.  The GOP's odds of winning the House, accordingly, were at 99%.  While news organizations predicted that Democrats would hold the House in the early hours of the election on Nov. 5, by Wednesday afternoon they began following Polymarket in saying those chances were ""fading.""  Just 24 hours earlier, the market was giving the Democrats a slightly better than even chance of prevailing in the lower house of Congress.  According to the Associated Press, control of the House was still undecided as of 2 p.m. ET. But the Republicans have won at least 52 Senate seats, ensuring them a majority in the upper chamber.  If the current odds are correct, then the Republicans, led by president-elect Donald Trump, will have hit the trifecta, controlling the White House and both houses of Congress.  That, in turn, would ease the path for comprehensive crypto legislation in the next Congress, something the industry has been pushing for, complaining that existing laws do not clearly address how digital assets should be regulated.  By contrast, Gary Gensler, the lame-duck chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission under outgoing President Joseph Biden, has insisted that existing rules are sufficient to supervise the industry.  To be sure, Polymarlet's House contract has relatively small volume ($2 million) compared to the now-resolved presidential market, which saw billions in trading.  In prediction markets, traders bet on the verifiable outcomes of real-world events within defined time frames. In recent weeks, the higher odds Polymarket gave Trump of winning the presidency compared to polls led to speculation in the mainstream media that someone was manipulating the market to overstate his chances.  Proponents have long argued that these markets can be a superior forecasting method compared to polls or punditry because the participants are putting money on the line and therefore are strongly incentivized to do thorough research and bet on what they believe will happen, not what others want to hear.  Trump's resounding victory, despite polls that showed a toss-up, supports that case.  ""Markets are better than models. Almost axiomatically, because any model that has [a] useful signal is already incorporated into market prices,"" said Flip Pidot, CEO and co-founder of American Civics Exchange, an over-the-counter dealer in political contracts.  ""Markets aren't perfect, but they're the best mechanism we've got, for discounting not only future cash flows but future uncertainties,"" Pidot said. ""So markets generally benefit from models to the extent they can incorporate them in their pricing.

This milestone pushed Bitcoin into price discovery, igniting significant liquidations across trading platforms. Data from CryptoQuant reveals an unprecedented surge in short liquidations, surpassing $100 million within a single one-minute candle, marking a historic moment for BTC. This explosive price action was fueled by the surprise Trump win in the U.S. election, which appears to have sparked renewed enthusiasm for crypto assets as investors respond to the potential economic policies ahead. The election outcome has sent shockwaves through the market, with Bitcoin leading a fresh rally across the crypto space. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Shares Correlation With S&P500 – Last Dip Before It Hits $10,000? Now in uncharted territory, Bitcoin’s move above $75,000 represents a powerful statement of investor confidence despite broader economic uncertainties. As BTC enters price discovery mode, traders and investors alike are bracing for further volatility, while many anticipate that this momentum could extend into even higher highs. The coming days will be critical as Bitcoin’s price action continues to drive liquidations and shape the outlook for the broader market. Bitcoin Bullish Phase Begins Bitcoin has officially entered a bullish phase, setting new all-time highs following Donald Trump’s election victory. As a known crypto supporter, Trump’s win has spurred market optimism, pushing BTC’s price above previous ATHs in a surge that began as election results favored his lead. This bullish breakout was accompanied by a dramatic liquidation spike, signaling strong buying pressure as bearish bets were swiftly unwound. Data from CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn shows that short liquidations exceeded $100 million in a single one-minute candle—an unprecedented event that underscores the power behind this rally and suggests that Bitcoin’s upward momentum is just beginning. In the coming days, volatility will remain high as global markets digest the election outcome and brace for the Federal Reserve’s upcoming interest rate decision on Thursday. Investors anticipate a dynamic market response, with possible ripple effects across traditional and crypto markets. Should the Fed keep rates steady or make any dovish adjustments, it could further bolster Bitcoin’s rally and strengthen the broader crypto market.

While short-term fluctuations are likely amid these major events, the long-term view favors a bullish trend as Bitcoin leads the crypto market higher in this new post-election environment. BTC Visits Uncharted Territory Bitcoin is trading at $73,800 after breaking its previous all-time highs and reaching a new peak of $75,300. This breakout has pushed BTC into uncharted territory, a phase that historically signals massive gains as bullish momentum builds. The focus is whether Bitcoin can maintain its momentum above the previous ATH of $73,800, a critical support level that could propel it further into new highs if held successfully. However, the timing of this move aligns with a particularly volatile week, as the market anticipates the Federal Reserve’s upcoming meeting. The Fed’s decision on interest rates could introduce significant unpredictability, potentially tempering BTC’s rise or even sending it below the $70,000 mark if the outcome diverges from market expectations. As BTC navigates this price discovery phase, investors are closely eyeing key levels.

35808923,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=100680,1730918153,"Battle For Iran’s Crypto Market: Deception, Sanctions, And Blockchain Transparency","Over the last few months, Iranian crypto exchange Nobitex has been at the eye of the storm in accusations that range from charges of money laundering to claims of ties with the Iranian government and facilitating violations of sanctions.Such claims, amplified by Farsi-speaking media channels in the orbit of the Iranian government, have left the general public uncertain on matters related to the safety of centralized exchanges in a heavily sanctioned country. With growing scrutiny, one may pose the following questions: What is the real motive for these campaigns? How does blockchain technology impact transparency? And what of the ordinary Iranians who, being increasingly dependent on cryptocurrencies, bear the brunt of these frustrations. Nobitex Allegations: What's the Real Story?Nobitex is Iran's largest cryptocurrency exchange, with more than 6 million active users and one of the biggest players in the local market. In May 2024, two senior U.S. senators wrote to the Treasury and Defense departments, expressing concern that the cryptocurrency exchange might be helping to facilitate money laundering and terrorism financing for the Iranian government.That, combined with OSINT reporting and insider investigations, fed accusations that Nobitex might be facilitating activities that violate international sanctions.At the core of such allegations is the claim that Nobitex has an underhanded connection with the Iranian government and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps—IRGC. Its critics say that transparency by the exchange can only be a thin disguise, and backstage, it gets involved in illicit financial activities for the Iranian ruling elite. This narrative is now being echoed through different channels, including Farsi-speaking platforms known for closeness to the Iranian regime.Motivations Behind the Campaign: Who Benefits?A closer look into the situation would suggest that the story is not quite so simple. Channels campaigning against Nobitex within the Farsi-speaking community appear to have an underlying agenda. Many of these outlets, have framed their opposition to blockchain technology in a way that benefits those who profit from Iran's black market currency exchanges and the high costs associated with traditional financial systems. These groups paint a picture of fear, suggesting that US sanctions will lead to something that some platforms like Nobitex are in a position to freeze. The goal here is to deter ordinary Iranians from using blockchain-based exchanges. Driving them back to the old, opaque ways of accessing foreign currencies: physical smuggling of US dollars or reliance on informal money changers.These forms of operations, although are much more expensive and riskier for the ordinary person, maintain those who control the underworld networks of currency in wealth.One plausible motive for these campaigns may be the desire to cling to the financial control that accompanies these older, more opaque systems. If platforms such as Nobitex and Tether are sanctioned, that would reduce access by normal Iranians to USD, forcing them back into traditional avenues of currency exchange, where the government and its proxies reap returns from higher costs and inefficiencies.Blockchain Transparency: A Tool or a threat?With all these allegations, it is very necessary to focus on the nature of blockchain technology itself, which provides a level of transparency and traceability that traditional financial systems simply can’t. All transactions on blockchain are open to the public and large-scale money-laundering activity would create a digital footprint that anyone with access to the ledger could analyze.For Nobitex to get away with such activities, these transactions would need to be hidden in plain sight—something blockchain just makes very difficult to do.Nobitex has claimed to operate within the confines of AML and KYC regulations that are comparable to those implemented by international financial institutions. In its annual reports, it underscored that it actively freezes suspicious accounts and tries to block high-risk payments. To this date, no solid evidence for blockchain transactions that would indicate Nobitex has been involved in money laundering has surfaced.On top of its AML/KYC measures, Nobitex has consciously avoided implementing tools from the blockchain that could help mask transaction histories, such as mixers—something most exchanges engaging in shady dealings make use of. The way mixers work is that they combine possible dirty transactions with clean ones to make it virtually impossible to trace where the money came from or went to. Such secrecy is usually a warning bell for regulatory authorities and blockchain analysts. The fact that Nobitex has decided not to use mixers is one example of a voluntary action that further underlines its intent to be on the straight and narrow. In this respect, by making sure that all its operations are transparently traceable on the blockchain, Nobitex actively demonstrates its commitment to full transparency and sends a clear signal that it does not take part in money laundering or any other illicit activities. This move divorces Nobitex from such platforms that try to hide their activities with obfuscation tools, further adding credibility to its operations.The Broader Impact on Ordinary IraniansOrdinary Iranians see access to these cryptocurrency platforms as a lifeline in the face of economic challenges and isolation brought about by sanctions. Blockchain comes with a transparency guarantee in the execution of transactions and also enables Iranians to bypass corrupt and often exorbitantly expensive traditional financial systems that have held sway over currency exchange in Iran for so long.In a nutshell, these disinformation campaigns are clearly meant to undermine security. The message being peddled on channels aligned with the government is that these platforms are unsafe, and that the U.S. government could freeze assets at any moment. This fear-mongering diverts from the fact that the more traditional means of money transfer are way riskier. It also ignores the transparency that comes with blockchain technology, which would give both regulators and users the wherewithal to flag and hopefully prevent illegitimate activities.Nobitex's Response and the Way ForwardNobitex has officially denied all allegations against it, pointing to the fact that it does not hold any connections with the Iranian government or IRGC, and that its platform has been designed to be in line with international standards. In 2022, the exchange posted its board of directors’ structure to prove there are no ties with the government.Furthermore, in monitoring transactions, Nobitex has been using machine learning algorithms to identify suspicious behavior, thereby underlining the efforts made by the company toward aligning with international compliance frameworks.The Final Word: Who Controls the Narrative?As the debate over Nobitex continues, it's becoming clear that much of the noise surrounding it is as much about control as it is about compliance. After all, the channels that have been slamming the exchange may not be doing so out of real concern about financial transparency but rather to maintain their grip on a lucrative, if opaque, financial system that has learned to thrive in the shadows of sanctions. Ultimately, it will be left to the test of its activities in the passage of time that Nobitex will actually prove its adherence to transparency and legality.

35807533,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651957,1730917924,Record-Breaking Bitcoin Surge Post-Trump Election: Futures Market Hints At More To Come,"The futures market is signaling that the current Bitcoin rally, spurred by Donald Trump’s recent election victory on Tuesday, might be starting. According to Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33 Research, the election’s immediate aftermath has seen a “risk-on rotation” across derivatives, indicating a surge in investor confidence. Bitcoin Options Market Targets $80,000 By Late November On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the basis—the difference between the spot market price and futures contract prices—has risen sharply from 7% to over 15% in a single day, reflecting heightened interest from institutional investors. Additionally, perpetual futures contracts, favored by offshore investors, are now trading at their largest premiums to the spot market since March, further underscoring rising demand for leverage. Related Reading: Ethereum Volatility Soon? Derivatives Exchanges Receive 82,000 ETH In Deposits Bitcoin recently surpassed $75,000 for the first time, buoyed by expectations that a second Trump presidency will usher in more favorable policies and regulations for the cryptocurrency sector, as he has vowed to support the growth of the market, with BTC at the heart of what could be a new economic policy for the nation. Before the election, NewsBTC reported that the Bitcoin options market had already set its sights on an ambitious target of $80,000 for expiries slated for late November, showcasing the optimism surrounding the asset’s potential. Analysts Predict Strong ETF Inflows Post-Election Michael Safai, founding partner at quantitative trading firm Dexterity Capital, told Bloomberg that Trump’s administration promises decreased regulatory intervention in the US, a development many crypto investors have advocated during previous years of heightened scrutiny. While exchange-traded funds (ETFs) backed by Bitcoin experienced one of the largest outflows on Monday, Safai suggests that traders remain optimistic about a potential reversal. Lunde also indicated that the European trading session had been relatively quiet. Still, Bitcoin appears to be finding support at its former all-time highs, a positive sign for continued upward momentum. Anticipating strong ETF inflows during US trading hours on Wednesday, the analyst expects the combination of rising CME premiums and post-election clarity to bolster Bitcoin’s performance. “The backdrop of burgeoning CME premiums presents carry opportunities that should support strong performance,” Lunde explained. However, amidst the positive outlook, some traders advise caution regarding potential price corrections. Related Reading: Uniswap Surges Toward $8.74 – Can UNI Push Through To New Heights? Previous bullish runs, such as the one witnessed in March following the introduction of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, led to significant liquidations across both directions of the market, with the cryptocurrency recording drops of over 20% following the record peak. Nathanaël Cohen, co-founder at INDIGO Fund, cautioned that profit-taking could trigger corrections at current levels. However, he remains optimistic about the overall trend moving higher in the coming months. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $74,430, up 6.2% on a 24-hour basis and nearly 4% every week.

42407317,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZAWK3,1730916641,How to Build an Asset Class in Three Easy Steps,"Andy: Kelly, the US election has concluded and Trump is headed back to the White House, bolstered by a GOP-lead Senate. Bitcoin has already posted a new all-time high, but we know there is no magic wand to transform crypto into a fully-functioning asset class. How will we get there?  Kelly: Let’s think about three parts: 1) regulatory infrastructure that allows projects to exist and to raise capital; 2) investment infrastructure that connects investors to the capital markets; and 3) an investment framework for allocators, big and small.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Andy: Nicely framed. That’s a lot! Let’s hit topic 1 today: regulatory infrastructure. If crypto is meant to be decentralized, why is the U.S. so important?  Kelly: Though crypto is inherently decentralized, with users and investors worldwide, the U.S. remains crucial due to its concentration of capital and favorable business environment. Globally, investors recognize the U.S. as a hub for technology and innovation. A supportive administration can further enhance this landscape, benefiting the industry. In the long term, as blockchain fosters decentralized trust and governance, societies may organize less by nation and more by shared interests, transcending traditional boundaries.  Andy: From the capital markets side — new projects needing access to investor capital — I agree; it’s hard to build without participation from U.S. lenders and investors. However, for the global markets side — trading, derivatives, services to hedge funds — I think global crypto is doing pretty well, given the obvious constraints. Financial engineering in cities like London, Zurich, Singapore and Hong Kong, with deep talent pools and a history of innovation, is doing well. The U.S. did (impressively, in hindsight) launch futures contracts on bitcoin and ether, a few ETFs and ETF options (soon), but for depth, breadth, and innovation, you have to get on an airplane.  Kelly: A primary barrier is the lack of regulatory clarity regarding whether digital assets qualify as securities or commodities. Currently, only bitcoin has a clear classification, while other tokens risk being labeled as unregistered securities. The SEC’s ""regulation by enforcement"" approach is unsustainable and may deter innovation within the U.S. This also has downstream implications for capital markets, as crypto-focused exchanges and custodians face the risk of offering unregistered securities under SEC guidance.  Andy: Indeed. As you have heard me rant about more than once, the regulatory “jump ball” between the CFTC and SEC is an impediment and a nuisance. This was true with basket swaps when Dodd Frank went into effect 12 years ago and it’s true now with crypto. I think about how the SFC in Hong Kong was out ahead creating regulatory structure around “virtual assets,” acknowledging their special properties and users. Now VARA in Dubai and, of course, MiCA in Europe are following suit in their own way. Much of this regulatory architecture is designed around existing assets and exchanges. You bring up an important point: new blockchain-based projects also deserve a clear path for financing and launch.  Kelly: How would you expect indices to be treated in a best-case scenario?  Andy: If the ultimate regulatory goal is investor protection, indices offer not only diversification of returns, but also of risk. If one index constituent fails, the index will replace it and survive. Not to say this removes risk, but non-systemic failures are not catastrophic. We think this provides a handy solution to regulators for index derivatives and index-based U.S. ETFs: if an index is demonstrably broad-based, it may not be necessary to make specific regulatory determinations about each and every constituent. If regulators insist on asset-by-asset regulation, users become concentrated into a small number of assets, even if those tend to be the largest, like bitcoin and ether.  So, we know what’s on our wish lists, but I guess we should end on an upbeat note. We are impatient, perhaps even frustrated, but also hopeful that the new administration can implement more crypto friendly policies, right, Kelly?  Kelly: Timing is critical, as other countries are competing to create a more favorable environment for blockchain technology builders. We are seeing significant developments with bitcoin, ETH ETFs, and the CoinDesk 20 index, which offers investors broad-based exposure to the crypto market. However, to fully capture the growth potential of blockchain technology and its applications, active management expertise is essential to navigate this emerging and complex space. As liquid venture investors, we strive to select high-potential projects with attractive valuations while closely monitoring regulatory and infrastructure developments to mitigate any non-investment-related risks that could impact our investment outcomes.  Andy: A path, even an arduous one, will be most welcome, and I think it will happen. And it looks like you have teed up the active vs passive debate! I look forward to it.

42407325,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZAWkV,1730916589,How Trump Could Change Crypto,"Early Wednesday morning, Donald J. Trump won a second presidential term, completing a stunning political comeback. His victory was also crypto’s.  The industry had championed his candidacy and donated millions to his campaign as well as a host of down-ballot races. Analysts expect a more permissive environment for crypto innovation and regulation as a result.  The election could usher in complete Republican control of the U.S. government, with the White House secured, the Senate flipped and the House likely (though not certain) to remain in the GOP’s hands. After four years of battling the Biden Administration’s, and especially the Securities and Exchange Commission's, opposition to digital assets, the crypto industry was euphoric at the results.  Here’s what the new political landscape could mean for regulation, assets and major projects, according to CoinDesk analysts and other observers.  Bitcoin to $100K and beyond  Bitcoin is already a beneficiary of yesterday’s election, with prices reaching an all-time-high soon after polls closed. CoinDesk senior analyst James Van Straten expects it to go higher still.  “BTC is still below the [Consumer Price Index] inflation adjusted price which is $77k, so it is still relatively cheap,"" Van Straten said. ""Google Search traffic for bitcoin on a one-year time frame is also near the lows, which shows we are not near any form of euphoria or greed in the market. As we enter the most bullish period of the year, Q4, we still have two weeks left of the 13-F filings, Nov.14 deadline, to see which institutions have bought the BTC ETFs. In addition, MicroStrategy has announced the biggest at-the-market (ATM) equity offering in capital markets history, which could set the stage for FOMO for other institutions.""  There are caveats, though.  “Trump’s proposed tariffs on China will drive consumer prices higher, bond yields will therefore have to go higher like we are seeing now and interest rates will have to stay elevated and we may even see rate hikes back on the table,"" Van Straten cautioned. ""This could stunt risk-on assets” – and bitcoin remains in that category.  Good for Tether (USDT), less so for Circle (USDC)  Trump's victory is also a win for Tether, issuer of the largest stablecoin, USDT, given the company's relationship with Cantor Fitzgerald. The financial giant manages over $100 billion in U.S. Treasuries for Tether, and Cantor's CEO, Howard Lutnick, has been a major Trump backer throughout the presidential campaign and is co-chair of the President-Elect’s transition team.  Tether is reportedly under investigation for violations of sanctions and anti-money laundering rules. ""While Trump’s election doesn’t necessarily mean the probe will go away, it’s reasonable to expect it won’t be pursued with the same enthusiasm as under the Biden administration,"" said CoinDesk markets reporter Tom Carreras.  “Tether will likely be given space to keep growing and cement its lead in the stablecoin space,"" Carreras said. With a market capitalization of $120 billion, USDT is over three times larger than its nearest competitor, Circle’s USDC. ""Trump’s win means the sky’s the limit as far as Tether is concerned. Consequently, it might be even harder now for Circle to catch up to its rival.""  But it’s not all bad news for Circle, Carreras added. The U.S.-based stablecoin issuer ""likely now has a more realistic path towards going public.”  Good for solana (SOL), less so for ether (ETH)  Solana (SOL), the third largest cryptocurrency, would also benefit from the election outcome.  “The SEC is poised for a change of leadership, and it would be surprising for the new chairperson to be as adversarial towards crypto as Gary Gensler has been,"" Carreras said. One result is that ""financial firms will likely file for spot SOL exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and there’s a decent chance that Solana’s uncertain regulatory status will get resolved, allowing financial institutions to interact with the network in a bigger way.""  A more accommodating SEC also means that “Ethereum is unlikely to remain the only smart contract platform to have a U.S. spot ETF for its token (ETH) or to have regulatory certainty around its status as a commodity,"" Carreras added. ""In other words, the playing field will likely be leveled, and we can expect competition between Ethereum and Solana to only get fiercer.”  More market breadth  So far this year, the rise of crypto prices has mostly been in BTC and a small number of other popular assets. Out of the 20 assets in the CoinDesk 20 index, only six were in the green as of Nov. 1 (Bitcoin Cash, Render, Near, Bitcoin, Ether, Solana).  Now, following the election, Andy Baehr, managing director at CoinDesk Indices, expects a broader rally.  “This time last year, hopes for bitcoin ETFs drove markets and sentiment higher, with bitcoin in the lead,"" Baehr said. ""This year, the hope is for better regulatory rails that will lead to broader adoption of a wide variety of digital assets. Fast Layer 1 and Layer 2 blockchains, and DeFi stand to gain as the market senses better market structure to promote growth opportunities.”  The CoinDesk 20 Index is up 8% in the past 24 hours (as of 11.30 am ET), led by Uniswap, Solana and Avalanche.  DeFi to benefit, led by Uniswap  Prices for decentralized finance assets have been relatively muted this cycle. But that could soon change.  “In his campaign, Trump promised to make the U.S. a leading hub for cryptocurrency, which might translate into more favorable regulations for DeFi,” said Shaurya Malwa, CoinDesk deputy managing editor for data and tokens.  “His campaign has indicated a move toward reducing the regulatory burden on crypto, potentially making it easier for DeFi platforms to operate within the U.S. This could involve clearer guidelines for token offerings, possibly recognizing certain tokens as commodities rather than securities under SEC oversight.  “Traders are already reacting to Trump's presidency favorably,"" Malwa observed. ""Uniswap's UNI is up 15% in the past 24 hours -- quelling concerns of an ongoing SEC lawsuit that alleged the protocol's makers sold securities in the U.S.”  Goodbye Gensler ?  In his acceptance speech, Trump said “I will govern by a simple motto, promises made, promises kept.” If so, that could mean a series of seismic changes for digital assets, per this reckoner from WU Blockchain:  Most SEC chairs step down following the election of a new president. Universally unpopular in crypto following his aggressive enforcement actions against major crypto companies, Gary Gensler is expected to leave by the end of the year, though appointing his successor will take time, according to reporting from CoinDesk’s Jesse Hamilton. However, Gensler's five-year term doesn’t expire until Jan. 5, 2026, and his immediate ouster is not a foregone conclusion.  “A second term for President Donald Trump doesn't mark an automatic end to Gensler's tenure,"" Hamilton wrote recently. ""If he decided to make a stand, he could finish out his term as a commissioner and maintain a Democratic majority at the agency for as long as it takes for the new president to make appointments and the Senate to confirm them.""  In May, Trump promised to commute the sentence of Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht, who is serving a life sentence. In January, he announced his opposition to a ""digital dollar"" (or central bank digital currency), joining a long list of Republican candidates who have made similar statements.",POSITIVE,SOL | USDT,BCH | MARKET | REGULATION | SOL | USDT,Benjamin Schiller,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/11/06/how-trump-could-change-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9759080935601de6354e226697bc0978d24747ab-5713x3809.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

35804639,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651841,1730914243,Uniswap Surges Toward $8.74 – Can UNI Push Through To New Heights?,"Uniswap (UNI) is riding a wave of renewed bullish momentum, with its price inching closer to the critical $8.74 resistance level. This surge has captured the attention of investors eager to see if UNI can overcome this hurdle and unlock fresh upside potential. As the market sentiment shifts more positively, the $8.74 level is a pivotal strength test for Uniswap’s rally. This article uncovers the dynamics behind Uniswap’s climb toward $8.74, evaluating if this resistance level could be the gateway to further gains. We’ll examine the key technical indicators, market sentiment, and potential challenges to determine if UNI’s bullish momentum can sustain a breakout, positioning it for a move to higher levels. What’s Driving The Recent Uniswap Surge? After rebounding from the $6.742 support level, UNI has displayed robust bullish momentum, pushing decisively above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the 4-hour chart. The move indicates a strong shift in sentiment as buyers regain control, propelling Uniswap toward the critical $8.748 resistance mark. Now approaching this resistance, UNI is testing the resilience of its upward strength, with a breakthrough possibly paving the way for additional gains and establishing a new higher trading range. Also, the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) analysis highlights renewed upside potential, with the RSI climbing from the oversold zone to above the 50% threshold. Now sitting at 85%, this upward movement suggests a strong increase in buying pressure, signaling a shift from the previous bearish phase toward a more neutral and potentially optimistic outlook. Related Reading: Uniswap Rallies In Bearish Conditions, Can UNI Break New Grounds? Additionally, the daily chart shows Uniswap is on a solid upward trajectory, underscored by a strong bullish candlestick that reflects sustained buying pressure. UNI’s position above the 100-day SMA further supports this positive price action, reinforcing the likelihood of continued gains. Trading consistently above this key SMA signals strengthening positive sentiment, as buyers maintain control and push the price toward higher levels, possibly setting the stage for a test of upcoming resistance zones. Lastly, the RSI on the daily chart has risen to 67%, recovering from a previous dip to 37%. If the RSI continues to climb, it could indicate growing strength in UNI’s price action. Additionally, staying above the 60% level would significantly boost the chances of sustained bullish momentum and potential breakouts, further reinforcing the asset’s positive sentiment. Resistance Or Launchpad? What $8.74 Means For UNI’s Future The $8.74 level for Uniswap represents a critical point of resistance determining the next phase of its price movement. If UNI can break through this barrier, it could act as a launchpad for further gains, with the $10 mark and beyond becoming attainable targets as the upbeat pressure accelerates.

42407320,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZAWXH,1730914019,Uniswap's UNI Token Soars 28% as Altcoins Outperform Following U.S. Presidential Election,"Buoyed by the prospect of a friendlier regulatory environment, altcoins were the biggest advancers after crypto-friendly GOP candidate Donald Trump Tuesday evening won another term in the White House.  The largest gainer by a wide margin was Uniswap's {{UNI}}, which was higher by 28% over the past 24 hours. Open interest (OI) for the token has soared by 20% in over the past day, according to Coinglass data and over 18 million UNI tokens ($169 million) are now in OI contracts, the highest amount since April 2024. OI in the past 24 hours alone has seen an increase of over 3 million UNI tokens worth over $60 million. The last time UNI saw such an aggressive increase in OI was back in April as prices were quickly falling.  Additionally, funding rates for UNI have doubled over the last day from approximately 5% to 10%, with a positive funding rate meaning traders who are long have to pay short traders to keep their position open. Other things being equal, higher funding rates mean traders are anticipating further price advances.  The UNI advance is pacing an 8.2% gain for the CoinDesk 20 Index, outperforming bitcoin's 6% rise to $74,600. Other notable movers from the gauge include Solana's {{SOL}}, up 10% and Avalanche's {{AVAX}} and ChainLink's {{LINK}}, each ahead about 8.5%. Underperformers include Ripple's {{XRP}} and Polkadot's {{DOT}}, each rising less than 4%.

Matching UNI's rally, native tokens of decentralized money market Aave {{AAVE}} and liquid staking protocol Lido {{LDO}} also advanced 20%-30%.  Uniswap in the past months has been a particular target of the U.S. regulatory apparatus, in April having received a Wells Notice of coming possible enforcement action by the Securities and Exchange Commission and in September agreeing to pay $175,000 to settle Commodity and Futures Trading Commission charges it offered illegal leveraged and margined commodities transactions.

SOL adoption is growing exponentially, with 50% of DeFi users and 78% of transactions on Solana, driven by efficient and user-friendly DEXs. Despite SOL's current underperformance compared to Bitcoin, its strong network growth and potential for future altseason make it a compelling investment. With Trump’s victory, a positive scenario could unfold for the crypto world, and Solana is showing strong momentum. Now I'm here to speak with you as a viewer, or, to use crypto slang, something like an external “TradFi investor” trying to ride the waves of the deep crypto space. Have you heard about decentralized finance (DeFi)? Some of you might be thinking, “wake up, boomer,” while others, more seasoned, might say, “you’re wasting your time.” Now, I’d like to take a neutral stance, not as a ""mooner"" or ""degen,"" and not as a ""banker"", to share my in-depth experience in a particular corner of the crypto space: Solana (SOL-USD). I've been exploring this microcosm since before the ""FTX collapse,"" observing the evolution of this blockchain as a viewer. In my opinion, despite its still ""unripe"" state, it deserves serious consideration, now more than ever, due to the potential emergence of a ""Trump era"" for the crypto market. But does it also deserve a place in a portfolio? Let’s analyze that. Solana is taking over the decentralized landscape. My assumption is based on a simple perspective: if Solana performs better than its peers, its adoption rate will likely increase, allowing SOL to capture market share from the native tokens of other blockchains. So, what is happening on-chain? While Ethereum is the most common altcoin, we must acknowledge that it faces serious competition with the rise of Solana, as the trend of 'new users' clearly illustrates. BNB -SOL; New user (Dune.com - @springzhang) While new user growth for BNB and ETH fluctuates, SOL adoption is experiencing exponential growth, surpassing other blockchain solutions. And this is a trend that has been noticeable in the crypto landscape since October 2023. Solana Monthly New Users Growth (Dune.com - @springzhang) However, what is happening now is a truly exponential growth in monthly users. In fact, looking at more recent analyses (30-day and 90-day), Solana now dominates the decentralized market, with 50% of DeFi users on Solana. 30 Days Users Total (Dune.com - @springzhang) And approximately 78% of total transactions. 90 days transaction total (Dune.com - @springzhang) This growth is due to the increasing ease and convenience of operating on its blockchain, as well as a strong network of highly efficient and user-friendly DEXs, like Raydium , which is now growing significantly in popularity. Solana USD volume (Dune.com - @ilemi) And this is also due to an extraordinary increase in new token listings , similar to what happened during the 2021 bull run on Binance Chain , where, with BNB, you could trade “shitcoins.” However, Binance Chain is not a decentralized chain, and over time, the market first shifted decentralized transactions to Ethereum and now to more efficient blockchains like Solana. New Trading Tokens (Dune.com - @ilemi) This is evident today, as volumes on Solana reached new highs in October, and the crypto world is now using SOL to participate in decentralized transactions. USD Volume All Chain DEX (Dune.com - @ilemi) And there’s been significant growth in stakeholders, with particularly interesting growth from Coinbase Cloud 02. Solana validator Stake Delegated (Dune.com - @ilemi) To summarize, since October 2023, Solana has embarked on a strong growth trajectory in terms of adoption of its blockchain. However, in October 2024, an unusual surge in usage around Solana emerged. Did the ""Trump era"" also mark a new era for the crypto world? Maybe, but what are the risks? Solana is highly correlated with Bitcoin’s price, like other altcoins in the crypto space. However, at the moment, SOL is underperforming compared to Bitcoin, while BTC/USD is being strongly pushed upward by the outcome of the U.S. election, with Trump as the winner. A Trump victory could bring positive outcomes for the crypto space, which is why investors are now focusing on BTC rather than altcoins. We’re currently experiencing a “Bitcoin season,” when BTC tends to perform better than altcoins. Alt Season index (coinmarketcap.com) Indeed, while BTC/USD is now reaching a new all-time high, SOL/USD remains within its channel, between $125 and the $200 range. It's particularly interesting that the price of SOL has stopped just below that level, despite SOL adoption having grown over the last month. SOL/USD - BTC/USD (TradingView) And here, it becomes important to talk about the 'Trump trade.' A positive outcome for Bitcoin, resulting from a Trump victory, could set the stage for an altseason. It’s possible, and if it happens, SOL is currently the native blockchain token with the most momentum, though it has lagged behind Bitcoin’s performance. Risk If this appears to give SOL an edge when the next altseason arrives, the strong connection to Bitcoin could also pose a risk. This is because it’s still unclear what Trump might ultimately decide regarding the crypto space . For that reason, I prefer to focus my analysis on Solana-specific risks; another classic bubble burst could occur. This has happened before, as seen with the collapse of FTX , a major stakeholder, and could happen again with the launch of a superior blockchain. The crypto market has a short memory, and the decentralized market could easily shift away from Solana with just one click. We must keep in mind that the crypto world is extremely dynamic, and today’s situation can be very different tomorrow. However, I believe that NOW, SOL/USD is once again well-positioned within the crypto world. Conclusion In conclusion, I give a BUY rating for SOL-USD due to the incredible increase in utilization of the Solana Network during this period. Even if altseason seems far off and Bitcoin remains at the center of the crypto world’s attention due to the 'Trump trade,' SOL is capturing even more “market share” compared to others while maintaining a similar risk profile. But remember, the crypto world never stands still, and today’s considerations could radically change in a short time.",POSITIVE,BTC | SOL | BNB,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | SOL | BNB,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4733753-solana-trump-trade-poised-for-next-crypto-market-era?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/35803416.jpeg

The bank will introduce on-chain foreign exchange capabilities as early as first-quarter 2025, with plans for automated, around-the-clock multicurrency settlements.  JPMorgan (JPM) rebranded its blockchain platform, formerly Onyx, as Kinexys as the banking giant doubled down on real-world asset tokenization efforts.  ""We aim to move beyond the limitations of legacy technology and realize the promise of a multichain world,” Umar Farooq, co-head of JP Morgan Payments said in a statement. “Our goal is to foster a more connected ecosystem to break down disparate systems, enable greater interoperability and reduce the limitations of today’s financial infrastructure.”  Tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) such as traditional financial instruments has been a fast-growing area for blockchain technology with big banks getting increasingly involved. JPMorgan was one of the early leaders in the tokenization space with Onyx and its JPM Coin blockchain-based settlement tech. JPM Coin has been renamed to Kinexys Digital Payments.  JPMorgan's blockchain business has executed over $1.5 trillion of transactions such as intraday repos and cross-border payments since its inception in 2020, processing an average of more than $2 billion a day, according to the bank. Its users are enterprises around the globe such as Siemens, BlackRock and Ant International.  The bank said it plans to introduce on-chain foreign exchange capabilities to the platform as early as the first quarter of 2025, paving the way for the ""automation of 24/7, near real-time multicurrency clearing and settlement."" The service will first be available for the U.S. dollar and euro with plans to expand to other currencies.

Donald Trump will get a second term, defeating Kamala Harris. In the midst of election night, the Bitcoin price rose to a new all-time high of $75,407 on Binance. The euphoria is driven by Trump’s big election promises. He wants to establish Bitcoin as a national strategic stockpile, fire Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler and generally enforce a crypto-friendly policy. While a Harris victory would have meant a short-term setback for Bitcoin according to most experts, the predictions by the majority of experts are extremely bullish thanks to the Trump victory. However, renowned economist Henrik Zeberg offers a cautionary perspective. Zeberg warns that Trump’s proposed economic policies could precipitate a US recession, leading to a “blow-off top” scenario for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Central to his argument is Trump’s plan to replace certain taxes with tariffs to stimulate domestic economic growth. Is A Bitcoin Blow-Off Top Scenario Looming? Drawing parallels with historical events, Zeberg suggests that Trump’s tariff strategy could echo the economic missteps of the 1920s and 1930s. In a post on X, he shared a link to the Wikipedia page for the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930. He stated: “Now everything is lined up for history to repeat itself. US Tariffs implemented into a Recession—reinforcing the downturn and popping the Greatest Bubble ever.” Related Reading: Analyst Reveals What The Gold Chart Says About The Possibility Of Bitcoin Price Reaching $100,000 The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act is widely regarded as a catalyst that deepened the Great Depression. By substantially increasing US tariffs on imported goods, the act prompted retaliatory tariffs from other nations, leading to a severe contraction in international trade. This protectionist spiral exacerbated global economic decline, resulting in heightened unemployment and prolonged hardship worldwide. Amid these economic concerns, Zeberg has projected a significant, yet potentially short-lived, surge in Bitcoin’s price. “Making it Simple! BTC target 115-123K,” he asserted via X a few days ago. His analysis is grounded in Fibonacci extension levels—a technical analysis tool used to predict future price movements based on historical price patterns. Related Reading: Institutional Traders Bet On Bitcoin Exceeding $79,300 By End Of November According to Zeberg’s analysis, the critical level to monitor is the 1.618 Fibonacci extension, calculated at $114,916.16. He suggests that this level is “very likely the top,” indicating that Bitcoin could reach this price point before experiencing a significant reversal. The analysis also notes other key Fibonacci levels that may serve as resistance points during Bitcoin’s ascent. The 0.382 level at $77,437.88 marks a significant initial resistance following the breakout from the previous all-time high. The 0.618 level at $85,205.47 could act as minor resistance as the price climbs. Additionally, the 1.0 level at $107,435.71 represents a crucial psychological and technical threshold, while the 1.27 level at $123,148.19 indicates a possible overshoot beyond the primary target zone. An annotation on Zeberg’s chart poses the question, “58% in less than 3 months into the top?” This suggests he anticipates a rapid price increase within a relatively short time frame, consistent with historical patterns.

The price of Bitcoin surged to an all-time high of $75,400 in the wake of the latest U.S. presidential election updates. Early results showed that Donald Trump, who has positioned himself as a pro-crypto candidate, is gaining significant momentum. This political development triggered a sharp rally in Bitcoin’s price. Although Bitcoin has since stabilized around $74,000, its ascent reinforced its position among the world’s top 10 largest financial assets by market capitalization.Bitcoin Market Now At Ease, Likely 40% to FollowAmid the recent rally, market analysts have turned their attention to Bitcoin’s cyclical nature. Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, highlighted how Bitcoin holders typically behave during market cycles. He noted that new investors often endure losses during bear markets, only to see their assets change hands after about two years, once the ""max pain"" phase subsides.Ju shared a chart showing these ""max pain"" zones, which are crucial for understanding Bitcoin's market dynamics. He emphasized that the current market environment aligns with an easing period.In parallel, Ju suggested that Bitcoin could see potential gains of 30-40%. However, he cautioned that the type of exponential gains seen during Bitcoin’s 368% surge from $16K are unlikely to be repeated.Moreover, Ju stressed that Bitcoin holders should consider taking profits before the next bear market phase sets in.https://twitter.com/ki_young_ju/status/1854088577694761331Bitcoin Amost Overbought?Bitcoin’s weekly technical indicators also provide important insights. According to TradingView, the price is trending near the upper Bollinger Band, signaling strong bullish momentum. However, when the bands widen, it typically suggests increased volatility, prompting traders to remain cautious.Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains just below 70, at 63, indicating continued upward momentum without immediate overbought risks. Market participants are now closely watching for a decisive breakout or a short-term correction, depending on Bitcoin’s ability to sustain gains above its key resistance levels.Staking Platforms Benefit From SurgeElsewhere, as Bitcoin’s price soared, staking platforms experienced a corresponding surge in activity. Solv Protocol, a prominent Bitcoin staking platform, achieved a record total value locked (TVL) of over $2 billion. According to DeFiLlama, nearly 30,000 BTC were staked on Solv, up from 16,340 in mid-October at the time of the report. This rapid growth coincides with Bitcoin’s historic rally, with the platform deploying assets across ten blockchain networks.SolvBTC, a key product within Solv Protocol, alone holds over $1.11 billion in value.

Three of the crucial seven swing states - N.C., Ga. and Pa. - have been called in favor of Trump. Treasury yields spiked across the curve . The benchmark 10-year yield ( US10Y ) was up 17 basis points to 4.45%, while the shorter-end, more rate-sensitive 2-year yield ( US2Y ) was up 10 basis points to 4.29%. For more, see how Treasury yields have done across the curve on the Seeking Alpha bond page. ""The market reaction so far is probably going as you would expect given the results,"" Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid said. Tesla ( TSLA ) shares soared 12% on Wednesday, with the EV maker seen as a major beneficiary under Trump's presidency. ""Financial markets have moved to price a victory by former U.S. President Trump. However, markets appear to assume that the campaign rhetoric (specifically around deportations and tariffs) will not fully translate into policy,"" UBS' Paul Donovan said. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) also smashed past the $74K level for the first time ever. Traders will also closely monitor the Federal Reserve's meeting, which starts on Wednesday. The interest rate decision will be announced on Thursday. Expectations are still a near-certainty of a quarter-point rate cut. But the odds of a similar cut in December have fallen below 70%. Looking further out, fewer cuts are priced in for 2025, with traders now betting on a terminal rate for that year of 3.75%, just 1 full percentage point from current levels, reached by June. On the earnings side, Super Micro Computer ( SMCI ) shares dropped 23.5% after the embattled artificial intelligence server maker reported preliminary fiscal first-quarter results and offered up an update from its independent special committee.

35800500,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=100617,1730906851,US Demand for Bitcoin Reaches Fever Pitch as Price Surges to Record High,"Demand for Bitcoin in the U.S. has heightened as BTC price surged past $75,000 following Donald Trump’s election victory, driven by expectations of pro-crypto policies. On Wednesday, Bitcoin climbed to an all-time high of $75,400. The cryptocurrency’s historic rally was fueled by a surge in investor confidence, sparked by Trump’s pledge to make the U.S. a “bitcoin superpower,” particularly after his victory in the presidential race.This latest surge surpassed Bitcoin’s previous record of $73,803, set in March, as traders capitalized on the momentum from key election victories in swing states such as Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Georgia.Trump’s pro-crypto stance , including promises to dismantle regulatory barriers, has attracted support from influential figures such as Andreessen Horowitz and the Winklevoss twins.Heightened Activities in Derivatives Market The spot market price rally was accompanied by a sharp increase in Bitcoin derivatives activity. Trading volumes surged by 161% to $168.17 billion, marking a significant uptick in participation.Similarly, open interest in Bitcoin futures contracts rose by 10.2%, reaching $44.34 billion. This increase suggests stronger trader confidence in capitalizing on Bitcoin’s bullish momentum. Bitcoin Derivatives Data Options trading mirrored this growth, with volumes climbing by 108.91% to $7.01 billion. Options open interest also increased by 6.69%, reaching $30.73 billion.However, market sentiment showed some divergence across platforms. Binance’s BTC/USDT ratio of 1.028 leaned slightly toward long positions, while OKX data revealed a bearish tilt, with a ratio of 0.8369 favoring shorts.As volatility spiked, liquidations surged across the market. Over the past 24 hours, total liquidations reached $279.58 million, with short positions taking the hardest hit at $217.07 million. Long liquidations came in lower at $62.51 million.U.S. Demand Drives Market Sentiment HigherThe Coinbase Premium Index offered further insight into Bitcoin’s record-breaking rally, revealing a strong correlation between U.S. demand and price performance.The index recently turned positive, indicating that Bitcoin was trading at a premium on Coinbase compared to other global exchanges. Historically, such positive premiums have often been associated with significant price increases, reflecting heightened buying pressure from U.S. investors. Coinbase Premium Market Sentiment Flips to ""Greed""This surge in demand aligns with broader market sentiment. The Fear and Greed Index, a widely watched measure of investor sentiment, registered a score of 70, indicating ""Greed."" While this is slightly lower than last week’s Extreme Greed reading of 77, it remains notably higher than last month’s Neutral score of 50.This shift highlights sustained investor enthusiasm as Bitcoin reaches new record highs, with the market responding to evolving geopolitical and economic dynamics.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/06/us-demand-for-bitcoin-reaches-fever-pitch-as-price-surges-to-record-high/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=us-demand-for-bitcoin-reaches-fever-pitch-as-price-surges-to-record-high,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

42407323,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZAWTy,1730906556,Polymarket Resolves Presidential Election Contract,"Polymarket has resolved its Presidential election contract, a $3.6 billion market that brought prediction markets to the mainstream.  The market was resolved just before 11 am eastern time, a few hours after the Associated Press and NBC called the election for Donald Trump.  Market rules required the Associated Press, NBC, and FOX News to all call it. Fox News' Decision Desk called it first.  Republican Donald Trump's historic reelection as U.S. president brought to a close Polymarket's contract asking users to predict the outcome of the 2024 election, which saw more than $3.6 billion in volume flow through its virtual pipes.  The contract was resolved just before 11 a.m. ET, when the Associated Press and NBC called the election for Trump. Fox News was the first major network to project Trump as the winner, a little after 1:45 a.m. ET, after he won the swing states of North Carolina, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Georgia.  The gap between the time when the market conditions were met and when the contract was resolved was because a resolution had to be proposed on UMA, Polymarket's current oracle and resolution source. UMA's dispute resolution system allows anyone to challenge a proposed market outcome by posting a bond during a 2-hour challenge period. If disputed, UMA token holders vote to determine the final resolution.  On-chain data shows that a French financial services professional, who is offering only the name Theo as a means of identification, was the largest winner of the evening with a profit of over $47.5 million across the Presidential election contract, the popular vote contract, and various swing state markets.  This French whale's method of registering multiple accounts on the site, all with pro-Trump positions, was a brief source of controversy as critics of prediction markets believed it was a form of dark money trying to influence mindshare.  In an interview with the Wall Street Journal in early November, Theo sought to debunk such claims by saying they were engaging in ""high-conviction"" trades by putting the majority of their available liquid assets on the line. The reluctance to go public, they explained to the Journal, was to keep it secret from friends and family.  Aside from Theo's multiple accounts, Polymarket bettor 'zxgngl,' who joined the platform just last month, won the second most out of any user on the platform, with an $11.4 million gain.  While the success of Polymarket's presidential election contract is credited with raising mainstream awareness of prediction markets in general, and many see it as a more accurate form of forecasting rather than traditional polling, Rajiv Sethi, Professor of Economics at Columbia's Barnard College, and author of the blog Imperfect Information, calls for caution.  ""The question of whether prediction markets are more accurate on average than statistical models can only be answered with data, it cannot be answered by logic alone,"" he wrote in an email to CoinDesk. ""We need to look at individual state outcomes, the popular vote, congressional races, and all other events for which models and markets were simultaneously generating forecasts. And we also need to compare markets with each other to discover what designs work best.""  Sethi suggests that factors like transaction observability, KYC requirements, participation restrictions, and position limits impact prediction markets, and that analyzing these effects will require careful, ongoing data study.  On-chain data via Dune shows that, as of early November, 73.8% of Polymarket's volume had come from election-related betting.",NEUTRAL,UMA,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | UMA,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/06/polymarket-resolves-presidential-election-contract,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/473cadb20fe4e7c052f29ddddcf48b15aee79ec0-1920x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This transaction took place in two parts: the first, involving 97,152 STRK tokens, occurred just five hours ago, followed by a second transfer of 2 million STRK tokens three hours later. Both transactions moved the assets to Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange.Collectively, the tokens Buterin has offloaded are worth about $799,000. The timing of the transaction has triggered curiosity among market observers. Vitalik Buterin wallet transactions with STRK Buterin Suffers Massive Loss from Holding STRK According to Onchain Lens, Buterin had received these STRK tokens over the last five months, with an initial value of $1.51 million. With the current market value of STRK approximately 50% lower than this original amount, Buterin is facing an unrealized loss of around $714,000 from his STRK holdings.This massive loss is due in part to STRK’s disappointing price performance since its launch earlier this year. After peaking at an all-time high of $3.66 in February, the token is now trading at $0.3795—down by a staggering 90%. During this period, STRK even hit an all-time low of $0.32 in August. StarkNet in a massive downtrend Interestingly, following the recent surge in the crypto market, driven by Bitcoin’s historic peak , Buterin appears to be trying to cut his losses by transferring his STRK tokens to Binance, especially as the token has posted a more than 10% gain today.Following this latest transaction, Onchain Lens noted that Buterin continues to hold 15,862 STRK tokens worth approximately $6,000.Vitalik Buterin's Relationship with StarkNet StarkNet is a promising zero-knowledge rollup project that has garnered significant attention as Ethereum’s community seeks ways to enhance transaction speeds and reduce costs on the network.Buterin's involvement with StarkNet dates back to its early days. He initially invested in the project during its seed round in May 2018, which raised $6 million. This move underscored his interest in supporting Layer 2 scaling solutions for Ethereum. In a subsequent funding round in July 2018, which raised $12 million, the Ethereum Foundation took the lead.",NEGATIVE,STRK,ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | BNB | STRK,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/06/ethereum-founder-vitalik-liquidates-2-09m-strk-tokens-on-binance-after-714k-loss/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ethereum-founder-vitalik-liquidates-2-09m-strk-tokens-on-binance-after-714k-loss,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

35797935,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651822,1730905229,"Grab Ethereum Now? Expert Says Next Stop Could Be $10,000 After ‘Final Drop’","Ethereum analysts are keeping a close look at the altcoin, which is stuck in a long downtrend. Some call for major upward breakout and others keep a cautious stance, warning to expect this downtrend will continue. Ali Martinez, a crypto analyst, is optimistic about the coin’s price trajectory, stating Ether would hit $10,000 in the coming bull run. Related Reading: Six Months, $1 Billion: TON Network’s Explosive USDT Adoption Milestone Martinez, whose research often links ETH with more general market movements, has compared Ethereum’s rise with that of the S&P 500, suggesting that a similar breakout might be just ahead. Nevertheless, not all individuals are satisfied with this optimistic outlook. Peter Brandt, another crypto expert, maintains an alternative perspective. Brandt, who is renowned for his technical expertise and precise predictions, has issued a cautionary note regarding a robust bearish pattern on the daily chart of ETH. In his most recent analysis, he emphasizes a “bearish flag”—a descending channel—that he believes indicates potential additional downside risk. The Stock Market Connection Martinez has grounded his case on the historical relationship between Ethereum and the S&P 500 (SPX). Examining ETH in tandem with SPX Martinez noted that both assets had a bottom in late 2022 and kept an increasing trend until 2023. #Ethereum $ETH has been mimicking the S&P500, and this could be the last dip before it triples and hits $10,000! pic.twitter.com/BgpbZQXM6I — Ali (@ali_charts) November 4, 2024 Based on the S&P 500 performance recently, he believes this alignment indicates ETH is preparing for a similar breakout. Martinez believes ETH might follow a similar trajectory, perhaps reaching the elusive $10,000 mark as the S&P 500 somewhat sank after its breakthrough to roughly $5,900. If such a trend is to follow through, then Ethereum needs a push to around 310% higher than the market price today. At the time of writing, Ether was trading at $2,618, up 8% in the last 24 hours. Martinez is cheerful about it, especially taking into account the development coming into the broader market perspective, although the objective has a very steep curve; however, Brandt’s warning is that ETH journey might not be as facile as envisioned, especially at the emergence of bearish signals. A Blend Of Signals The on-chain data from IntoTheBlock indicates that Ethereum holders have a divided sentiment. At present, nearly 23% of active addresses that hold ETH are in advantageous positions, which indicates that these holders are “in the money.” Although this implies that there is support at a certain level, the break-even level of 60% of the portfolios implies that the market remains uncertain. The holding by these individuals will determine how to buy more units or sell them in case of either a rise or drop in the price of Ethereum during the next weeks. More Losses Ahead? Veteran trader Peter Brandt warns that ETH’s bearish trend is severe and improbable to turn around. Brandt lately saw ETH’s daily chart’s negative predominance and projected more losses. Interesting to note that there was not a buy signal in $ETH In fact, chart remains bearish with unmet target at 1551 pic.twitter.com/sjkXyTQXU2 — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) October 31, 2024 October 31 saw seasoned analyst Brandt, known for his accurate forecasts, draw attention to Ethereum’s bearish trend on X (formerly Twitter). ETH’s one-day chart starting in August has indicated a declining trend. This “bearish flag” indicates that the fall will keep on. Brandt saw no Ethereum purchase signals or momentum changes. His negative view contradicts with the rally forecasts of speculators. Since the chart shows no reversal, Brandt thinks ETH’s price may fall below current support levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mining Costs Spike To Nearly $50K As Miners Look To AI For Survival A Differing Perspective Although both are highly contradictory in terms of their opinions, the analysis by Martinez and Brandt of what is likely to happen in the subsequent phases of Ethereum has revealed such unpredictability. Ether is seen to continue its rise upward like that of S&P 500 toward $10,000. On the other hand, a similar cautionary tale given out by Brandt suggests that even in the future, difficulties may lie ahead due to the continuous presence of downward forces.

Grewal, the Chief Legal Officer at San Francisco-based exchange Coinbase, mentioned that voters in the United States expressed a strong desire for change on several issues, including crypto regulations.He encouraged the SEC to change its current crypto regulatory approach to a more favorable stance. Specifically, Grewal called on the SEC to engage directly with crypto-related companies instead of suing them in court. Furthermore, Grewal advised the regulator to initiate rulemaking immediately, which could provide clear regulations for the crypto industry. Over 200 Pro-Crypto Candidates Win Grewal’s comment is in reaction to the election outcome, which saw voters come out to change the status quo. Prior to the election, crypto enthusiasts expressed support for only pro-crypto candidates across various offices, including the presidency. Earlier today, The Crypto Basic reported that about 238 pro-crypto candidates led the charge in the U.S. Congress elections. While 224 were elected to the House of Representatives, 14 are heading to the Senate. For many crypto fans, the most exciting part of the U.S. 2024 election outcome is Donald Trump's emergence as president-elect. Trump’s support for the industry is public knowledge, as he has consistently revealed how he plans to make America the ‘crypto capital of the world.’ Part of his campaign promises for crypto includes firing SEC Chair Gary Gensler on his first day in office. SEC Operations Under GenslerMany industry stakeholders see Gensler as a major threat to crypto. Under his leadership, the SEC has been aggressive, pursuing multiple enforcement actions against crypto companies. Coinbase is one of the victims of the Gensler-led SEC enforcement action. Last year, the SEC charged Coinbase with violating federal securities laws by operating as an unregistered exchange. A federal judge denied the exchange’s request for an early dismissal of the SEC charges in March. The lawsuit could see a major twist in the coming weeks when the more than 200 pro-crypto candidates are sworn into office, coupled with a potentially new SEC administration. Currently, there is speculation that the new SEC administration might review and possibly drop most of the lawsuits against the industry. Whether this would become a reality remains to be seen.",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/06/coinbase-clo-addresses-sec-adverse-crypto-regulation-using-us-election-outcome/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=coinbase-clo-addresses-sec-adverse-crypto-regulation-using-us-election-outcome,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

The 2024 U.S. presidential election has concluded with Republican candidate Donald Trump emerging as the victor . Trump captured 277 electoral votes and received 71.2 million votes in total, translating to 51% of the popular vote. Meanwhile, Democratic candidate Kamala Harris garnered 224 electoral votes and accumulated 66.28 million votes, representing 47.5% of the total. Amid Trump’s early lead, the crypto market experienced a surge, with Bitcoin (BTC) reaching a record-breaking high of over $75,000 earlier in the morning. Though BTC has since retreated slightly, it remains steady above the $74,000 mark.Ripple CEO Presents 100-Day Demands for TrumpAmid the election's impact on cryptocurrency markets, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has outlined what he sees as critical steps Trump should prioritize to strengthen the U.S. cryptocurrency industry in his first 100 days in office. https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1854134741089316961Garlinghouse, a long-time advocate for clearer crypto regulations partly due to Ripple’s years-long battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), called on Trump to make leadership changes at the SEC, especially regarding SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Garlinghouse has urged Trump to dismiss Gensler on day one, advocating for the SEC to be led by figures who are more receptive to pro-crypto policy. Recall that Trump presented this as one of his campaign policies, noting during the Bitcoin 2024 Conference that he would fire Gensler on day 1 as president.Among Garlinghouse’s suggestions for Gensler’s replacement, he mentioned Christopher Giancarlo, a former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Brian Brooks, former Acting Comptroller of the Currency, and Dan Gallagher, a former SEC commissioner. Regulatory Clarity is ParamountBesides leadership changes at the SEC, Garlinghouse is pushing for bipartisan legislative cooperation to advance a comprehensive digital asset market structure bill. The bill could address regulatory gaps and provide clarity for the local crypto industry. Another point on Garlinghouse’s list is clarification around asset classifications. He stressed the need for Trump’s administration to define key cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum (ETH), much like the clarity XRP and BTC have received. Such regulatory transparency would address whether ETH should be classified as a security, which remains a divisive topic within the industry. Despite the SEC approving Ethereum ETFs , the regulatory agency has not publicly declared that ETH is not a security. Notably, Trump’s campaign included promises to bring clarity to the cryptocurrency sector, retain the government’s Bitcoin holdings, and prevent the introduction of a central bank digital currency (CBDC).",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH | XRP,BTC | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/06/ripple-ceo-asks-trump-to-fire-gensler-on-day-1-and-give-ethereum-clarity-like-xrp/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ripple-ceo-asks-trump-to-fire-gensler-on-day-1-and-give-ethereum-clarity-like-xrp,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

35796543,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=100623,1730903331,"Market Expert Says Dogecoin Could Surge 11,486% to $23 on Elon Musk’s Influence","Market analyst Ali Martinez has expressed confidence in an explosive Dogecoin upsurge to double figures, citing Elon Musk’s influence and historical trends. Dogecoin has been on an impressive run in the weeks leading to the just-concluded US presidential elections. For context, the leading meme coin has respectively surged 17.62%, 17%, and a staggering 79% in the past day, week, and month.The upsurge saw it briefly topple notable cryptocurrency XRP to temporarily rank 7th in the market cap rankings. However, DOGE has returned to eighth place, with a valuation of $29 billion at press time.Meanwhile, general market consensus believes that Dogecoin’s impressive outing is tied to Elon Musk’s close ties to US president-elect Donald Trump. The Tesla CEO played a crucial part in Trump’s reelection, with the X owner agreeing to participate in the president’s new governance in a capacity he has teased as the D.O.G.E. (Department of Government Efficiency) .Analyst Expects Musk’s Influence to Continue DOGE PushIn a November 6 tweet , Martinez asserted that the Musk-DOGE romance would continue to spur the meme coin’s explosive run. Notably, the SpaceX founder has not hidden his love for the original meme coin, stating he is fond of the token due to its funny memes and dog jokes.Martinez insisted that Musk’s pronounced participation in Trump’s reelection would continue to drive Dogecoin to new highs. In his words, Dogecoin “could be primed for a wild ride” on Musk’s influence.Meanwhile, market veteran Peter Brandt agrees with Martinez’s speculations, stating “in Musk we trust.” Brandt acknowledged the X owner’s influence in Dogecoin’s recent run and noted that it has spurred the leading meme coin past a crucial price structure.In a Wednesday tweet , Brandt stated that Dogecoin has confirmed a breakout from a channel on its 1W timeframe after the surge to over $0.2 today. With the affirmation, Brandt asserted that the dog-themed token is on its way to bullish price accumulations and a new all-time high.Martinez Gives Targets for DogecoinThe market expert stated that Dogecoin would hit $4 and $23 if bullish momentum continues and history repeats itself. Martinez cited historical price action, evident in the past two cycles, to back up his assertion.According to the analysis, Dogecoin surges to Fib. 1.618 or even 2.272 every time it breaches the 50% retracement zone. An accompanying chart shows that DOGE followed this price action in the 2017 and 2021 bull cycles. Dogecoin Analysis per Ali Martinez Martinez argued that a similar pattern could repeat this cycle as Dogecoin has breached the 0.50 Fibonacci level with the surge past $0.1905 to above $0.2000. The expert noted that the 1.618 and 2.272 retracement zones lie at $4 and $23, and DOGE could be on its way to a 1,915% and 11,486% bullish upsurge.Meanwhile, Wednesday’s analysis is one of the many ambitious predictions Martinez has made about Dogecoin. Earlier, he predicted a lofty 8,032% uptick to $10, citing a continuation in its rising wedge price pattern.In the meantime, Dogecoin trades at $0.1985, down 6.8% from its daily high of $0.2121.

BTC was up 7.6% to $74K, while dogecoin, leaped as much as 18% as at 9:24 am ET. It’s the favorite cryptocurrency of billionaire Elon Musk, one of Trump’s most prominent supporters. The world's largest cryptocurrency has received a shot in the arm lately after Trump embraced it as part of his election campaign - a marked departure from President Joe Biden's current government which has cracked down on the sector. Trump's win should help improve regulatory clarity for digital assets, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Senate Banking Committee could become more crypto-friendly, CoinDesk reported citing a Bernstein research report. Trump had also made an appearance at the annual Bitcoin Conference in July, and has said he wanted to turn the U.S. into the ""crypto capital of the planet and the bitcoin superpower of the world.""

42407326,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZAWno,1730902594,"Trump Wins, Bitcoin Unlikely to See Big 'Sell-The-Fact' Price Drop: Omkar Godbole","The last-minute improvement in Kamala Harris' odds over the weekend flushed out excess leverage from the crypto market.  BTC never really had a steep ""buy the rumor"" rally, with retail investor interest staying low.  The other side of the Trump trade—hardening bond yields and rising dollar index—could weigh on BTC.  If you have been tracking financial markets, you have likely come across the ""sell the fact"" adage, suggesting that markets tend to drop after realizing highly anticipated positive developments.  A notable example of the phenomenon would be bitcoin's 22% slide in two weeks after the much-awaited spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) began trading in the U.S. on Jan. 11.  Now, market watchers may anticipate a similar sell-off in bitcoin as Republican Donald Trump, who, after months of winning over the crypto community by embracing digital assets, is set to return to the White House.  A big sell the fact decline, however, looks unlikely to due following reasons:  Last minute de-risking  The final stretch of the U.S. presidential election campaign was characterized by a sudden spike in Democrat candidate Kamal Harris' victory odds in crucial swing states like Pennsylvania.  As Harris' odds picked up in the second half of last week, the so-called Trump trades, involving bullish bets in BTC, the dollar index, and short positions in Mexican peso and government bonds, ran out of steam.  BTC turned lower from the high of $73,400 last Tuesday and probed lows under $66,000 early this week. The price drop flushed out excess leverage that was reminiscent of the January ETF launch, according to data tracked by analytics firm BlockScholes.  The chart shows that the short-duration BTC futures yields or basis surged in October alongside a spike in funding rates, reflecting a bullish leverage buildup as prediction markets pointed to a convincing Trump win.  Both metrics climbed down over the weekend as Trump's victory became uncertain, signaling a last-minute moderation in the derivatives market activity and setting the stage for a long-lasting bullish action on potential Trump victory.  Additionally, with Harris and Trump running neck and neck over the weekend, traders could not fully commit to pricing in a Trump or Kamala victory. Now that Trump has officially won, traders will likely be more confident in expressing their bullish views.  Absence of ""buy the rumor"" rally  The key prerequisite for a sell-the-fact price drop is a strong buy-the-rumor rally. Bitcoin never really had it.  Trump began courting the crypto community aggressively in June, taking several steps to win their votes, including promising to launch a strategic bitcoin reserve in a potential second term. Additionally, he launched his cryptocurrency venture, World Liberty Financial and accepted crypto donations. These initiatives heightened hopes that a second Trump administration would bring regulatory relief to the crypto industry, leading to BTC often taking cues from Trump's election victory odds.  Despite all optimism, bitcoin's price remained trapped in a broad sideways range, with the upside consistently capped at around $70,000 due to supply overhang fears and macroeconomic factors. And it's only today that prices have broken out of the prolonged seven-month trading range. In other words, the party looks set to continue without a major hiccup.  Besides, there is barely any sign of retail investor frenzy, as highlighted by low values in Google search query for the term ""Bitcoin"" relative to the term ""Trump."" A retail frenzy is often observed at notable market tops.  Watch out for the other side of the Trump trade  The other side of the Trump trade involves taking bearish bets on U.S. government bonds (betting on higher bond yields) and betting on gains in the dollar index. This could pose a headwind to risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.  Yields are already rising as Trump has promised to impose sweeping tariffs on China, Mexico and other prominent trading partners in a bid to onshore manufacturing. Tariffs, however, are inflationary in nature and may derail the Fed's plan to normalize the overly tight monetary policy via rate cuts.  The yield on the 10-year Treasury note has jumped 20 basis points to 4.47%, teasing a move past an 11-month downtrend line. Accelerated gains in the benchmark yield or the so-called risk-free rate could strengthen the dollar and drain capital from riskier assets.

Following this development, crypto analyst Tony Severino has revealed what to expect next from the flagship crypto. Bitcoin Price Ready For “Fireworks” After New ATH In an X post, Tony Severino indicated that the Bitcoin price is ready to experience a parabolic rally, as he told market participants to expect fireworks above $75,000. The crypto analyst also revealed that Bitcoin was approaching the 2-week upper Bollinger Band while the bands are the tightest in history according to the BBWidth. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Marks Local Bottom, Can Price Run 100% From Here Again? The accompanying chart, which the crypto analyst shared, showed that the Bitcoin price could rise to as high as $140,000, with the flagship crypto reaching a potential market top in 2025. Tony Severino had previously mentioned that Bitcoin was approaching the strongest part of the bull run and explained how, based on historical trends, BTC could rise to as high as $133,000. Indeed, the Bitcoin price looks to be entering the strongest part of the bull run following its rise to a new all-time high. This recent price rally to a new ATH is thanks to Donald Trump, who has been elected to become the next US president. This provides a bullish outlook for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market since the US president-elect has publicly declared his support for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Besides Trump coasting to victory, it is worth mentioning that the Bitcoin price has historically never been below the levels it was at on US presidential election days. Therefore, this is likely the lowest range the flagship crypto might trade at before it records the next parabolic leg of this bull run. A Fed Rate Cut Is Also On The Way In addition to Donald Trump’s victory, some other catalysts are lined up to spark the next leg of the Bitcoin bull run. One is a possible Fed rate cut that is expected to come on November 7, which is bullish for the Bitcoin price. The US Federal Reserve begins its FOMC meeting today and will decide on a rate cut by tomorrow. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Record Largest Accumulation Week Since January With 2.10 Billion Tokens Bought CME Fedwatch data shows a 97.6% chance the Fed will cut interest rates by 25 basis points (bps). This provides a bullish outlook for the Bitcoin price as more capital is set to flow into its ecosystem. Institutional investors are also on the sidelines as they will likely invest more money in the Spot Bitcoin ETFs after the US elections and a Fed rate cut. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $74,500, up over 9% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

There is also no confirmation on whether the sale actually took place or if he was joking.Given the lack of details, community members are pressing for more information, asking him to share a receipt or the specifics of the XRP transaction. The tweet was accompanied by a picture of a sleek Lamborghini Huracán Spyder parked in a lot, but no other information was provided.While skepticism surrounds Myles' latest disclosure, his bold claims about XRP investments are not new. Just six days ago, he disclosed that he had sold his kidney on the dark web to acquire more XRP and Dogecoin—a statement that also raised eyebrows.Liquidates Home Property for $800K to Buy XRPIn a separate story from February, Myles shared an intriguing account about his father’s bold investment move in XRP. According to Myles, his father traded his home for $800,000 and used the entire sum to buy XRP.Myles also highlighted his father’s extensive experience in investing, noting that the senior trader has been active in the markets for over 50 years. The decision to liquidate real estate for XRP was described by his father as the most significant ""home run"" of his career. When asked if the story was genuine, Myles confirmed it was true.Bold XRP TargetsGiven his strong conviction in XRP, Myles has repeatedly shared ambitious price targets for the cryptocurrency. In the short term, he is forecasting XRP will reach $1.96 and $2.84. He has even predicted that XRP will reclaim $3 by December —specifically during Christmas. In the longer term, Myles has set his sights on a price of $589 for XRP by 2030.

35793852,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=100611,1730898309,Binance Research Reveals 97% of Memecoins Are Dead,"A November research conducted by the Binance Research team disclosed that a staggering 97% of meme coins deployed into the crypto market are literally dead. Meme coins, an integral part of the cryptocurrency sector, have gained popularity due to their community-driven, intense price swing features. These tokens have become an alternative investment for quick returns and adventurous liquidity, engaging a wide range of investors.A report from Binance Research, headed by Joshua Wong, discussed the dynamic role meme coins play in the crypto industry and how the sector can survive the emerging mainstream curve digital assets are taking. The report further disclosed the current state of the joke-driven industry, including some shocking data and analyses.Research Shows Memecoin Deployment Has Surged ExtensivelyThe recently released report reveals that the rate of meme coin deployment into the crypto market has surged exponentially in the past year. Per the data, 75% of meme coins with non-zero trading volumes in the market were created between 2023 and 2024.Notably, the trend is understandable following the development of protocols that make meme coin creation and deployment easy. For context, platforms like Solana’s Pump.fun , Tron’s SunPump , and Cardano’s Snek. fun was introduced this year, making meme token creation stress-free and cheap for intending users. Memecoin Deployment Chart However, as creation and deployment became more straightforward, the sector became saturated with bad actors and unneeded tokens, with each creator angling for traction among the crypto community. Notably, the report shows that the survival rate of meme coins has dropped drastically, as they are unable to stand the test of time.According to the report, 97% of meme coins are dead. Notably, dead in this context means they have $0 in trading volume. The report shows that only the top two meme coins by market cap, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu, have sustainably maintained traction in their 10 and 4 years of existence, respectively.Growing Meme Cabals and ScamsThe Binance researchers also uncovered a disturbing trend in the meme sector: the growth of “cabals.” The report referred to cabals as groups that create pump-and-dump tokens and use retail as exit liquidity.While blockchain technology allows you to see token concentrations and on-chain activities, it is still impossible to determine who owns an address. Hence, exploiters could still create meme coins, promote them across social media platforms, and sell their liquidity provider or a large chunk of the minted token when they gain traction.This trend has recently been seen among meme coins. For context, the WALDO token creator leveraged Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson’s mention to rug-pull investors of thousands of dollars. Also, famous footballer Kylian Mbappe’s X account was compromised and used to promote a Solana-based meme coin, MBAPPE . While investors flocked to the tokens, the creators dumped them and made off with substantial gains.Research Shares Future Outlook for MemecoinsMeanwhile, Binance researchers noted that meme coins will continue to thrive in the industry. However, the next generation of successful memes would have to create tokens with “unique narratives and ideas that have long-term appeal” to their users.This point proves valid, as tokens that moved past the long-standing dog-themed narratives to other niches gained immense traction. For instance, Pepecoin and POPCAT created monkey-themed and feline-themed narratives, surging significantly upon their market debut.Furthermore, the reports disclosed that enhancing meme coin use cases would ensure their long-term relevance. The researchers encouraged the creation of memes with innovative technologies and ideological advancement so that the hype around the token would outlast short-term trends and traction.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | SHIB | RESEARCH | BNB,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/06/binance-research-reveals-97-of-memecoins-are-dead/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=binance-research-reveals-97-of-memecoins-are-dead,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

The more pro-crypto candidate had claimed victories in swing states like North Carolina and Georgia, before Pennsylvania, viewed by many as the key to the election's outcome, moved in his favor as well. BTC was recently trading over $74,000, around 1.3% lower than its new all-time high of $75,363.66, according to Coindesk Indices data. The broader digital asset market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index, is over 9% higher in the last 24 hours.  DOGE and SOL led gains among major tokens as the crypto market rallied while the election result was unfolding. Memecoin DOGE mushroomed over 25%, climbing to nearly $0.22. It remains nearly 20% higher in the last 24 hours, thanks in no small part to the support of Trump-endorsingElon Musk. The X owner and noted DOGE fan has proposed a Department of Government Efficiency — abbreviated as D.O.G.E; a clear nod to the token — as an agency that will make government spending and monetary planning more effective as part of the Republican campaign. SOL saw gains of nearly 20% to reach a high of $188.30 on the back of perceived hopes that a pro-crypto administration will make the approval of a Solana ETF more likely.  Crypto equities climbed by more than 10% in pre-market trading. MicroStrategy added 12%, approaching $255, just a few percentage points away from a record that would be almost 280% higher year-to-date. Coinbase is also 12% higher, approaching $220 a share. Bitcoin miners Riot, Marathon and IREN all gained more than 10%. Other notable mentions include Metaplanet which rose 24% and is now up over 1,100% year-to date. This comes after Semler Scientific saw a 30% increase in its share price yesterday, taking the shares to $39. André Dragosch, head of research in Europe at Bitwise, told CoinDesk that the initial stock-market reaction highlights the optimism that a more pro-crypto regime will provide the catalyst for a renewed bull run.  Chart of the Day  The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note has jumped 20 basis points to 4.47%, surpassing the year-long downtrend line.  The uptick likely represents concerns that Trump's promised tariffs, immigration control could lead to stickier inflation.

Bernstein said faster progress is now expected for both stablecoin and market structure bills.  The broker said it expects a rerating of wider crypto assets.  The U.S. election result should improve regulatory clarity for digital assets, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Senate Banking Committee becoming more crypto friendly following Donald Trump's victory in the presidential race and the Republican party securing control of the Senate, broker Bernstein said in a research report Thursday.  ""We expect a new regime of crypto rule making,"" the broker said, adding that this ""transformational shift is not priced in.""  Faster progress is now expected for both stablecoin and market structure bills, Bernstein said. This is positive for stablecoin issuers such as Circle and Paxos as well as leading U.S. crypto exchanges and broker/dealers.  Bernstein noted that the SEC is in legal battles with key crypto industry participants including Coinbase (COIN), Robinhood (HOOD) and Binance as well as decentralized finance (DeFi) and stablecoin companies.  ""In the medium-term, we expect clarity on definition of digital assets versus securities and a progressive framework to register digital asset securities with the SEC,"" analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote.  The broker said it expected a rerating of broader crypto assets, which have suffered from a lack of clarity as to whether they qualified as securities.

35792644,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651778,1730898015,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) Gearing Up For Massive Bullish Wave Following 8% Daily Surge, 110% Rally Ahead?","Shiba Inu (SHIB), the second-largest memecoin by market capitalization, has seen an 8% daily surge following Bitcoin’s surge to $70,000. Amid the market volatility, the token is trying to recover a key resistance level, which could propel the price to a 110% rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Below $70,000: What Does It Have To Do With Whales And The US Presidential Elections? Shiba Inu To See 110% Surge Soon Shiba Inu’s recent performance saw the cryptocurrency display red numbers in several timeframes. Following the market’s most recent pullback, SHIB retraced 13% to its lowest weekly mark of $0.00001632, registered on November 3. However, the token has bounced 12% from its lowest seven-day price, recovering the $0.000018 resistance level on Thursday. SHIB’s performance is seemingly fueled by BTC’s recent jump back to the $70,000 mark, which sent the memecoin above the $0.00001855 resistance before retracing. Moreover, the token’s daily activity increased 67% in the past 24 hours, seeing a daily trading volume of nearly $730 million. Some market watchers highlighted Shiba Inu’s recent performance, suggesting that the token is preparing for a massive rally in the coming days. Analyst Globe of Crypto stated that SHIB is looking positively to retest the resistance of the Descending Broadening Wedge pattern. Per the post, if the 1-day candle surpasses the $0.000019 resistance level, the memecoin could see a breakout from the formation. This zone was a crucial bounce level for Shiba Inu’s 136% rally in early March. As a result, the analyst considers that a successful breakout and reclaim of this level could start a “100-110% bullish wave,” which could propel the price toward the $0.000040 zone. Is $0.000081 The Next Big Target? Crypto analyst Javon Marks predicted a 351% surge toward SHIB’s all-time high (ATH) levels. The analyst noted that Shiba Inu broke out of a multi-month falling wedge pattern in early 2024, which sent the price toward Q1 highs. Since then, the memecoin moved within another multi-month falling wedge formation after registering a 70% correction from its year-high of $0.000043. SHIB broke out of this pattern around the end of Q3, kickstarting the token’s one-month 58% rally. Despite the recent market retrace, the analyst notes that Shiba Inu held above the breakout levels, confirming “a bull pattern with the RSI on the daily chart.” Marks considers that the memecoin’s next leg up is in its early stage, setting the rally’s target at $0.000081. Related Reading: PolitiFi Memecoins Soar: Trump-Themed Tokens Rally 30% Ahead Of US Elections Similarly, another market watcher shared his positive outlook for Shiba Inu’s price. Analyst Investing Haven suggested that SHIB’s current levels are not a cause for concern since “there’s “no long-term trend violation.” To the analyst, the memecoin’s levels to watch are between the $0.0000133-$0.00001444 prince range, as losing this support zone could signal a trend shift. However, Shiba Inu must reclaim the $0.000020 mark to continue its ascending trajectory. As of this writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00001828, an 8% surge in the daily timeframe.

MicroStrategy is approaching a record high, adding 12% in pre-market trading.  Disclaimer: The analyst who wrote this piece owns shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR), Riot Platforms (RIOT), IREN, Semler Scientific (SMLR) and Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA).  U.S. crypto company shares surged in pre-market trading after bitcoin {{BTC}} jumped above $75,000 on indications Donald Trump was on track to win the U.S. presidential election, an outcome confirmed when he secured more than the 270 electoral college votes needed for victory.  MicroStrategy (MSTR), the largest corporate holder of bitcoin, added 12%, approaching $255 and is just a few percentage points away from a record high that would represent a 280% climb this year. Crypto exchange Coinbase also gained 12% as did crypto miner Riot Platforms (RIOT). Other miners also rallied, with Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) rising 11% and IREN (IREN) 12%.  Other notable mentions include Tokyo-based Metaplanet (3350), which is mimicking Microstrategy's policy of buying bitcoin, and added 24%. The investment adviser has rocketed more than 1,100% year-to date. CEO Simon Gerovich said the company saw a record trading volume of 11.63 billion yen ($76 million). This comes after Semler Scientific (SMLR), another bitcoin investor, saw a 30% increase in its share price yesterday.  Tesla, whose CEO Elon Musk supported Trump during the election campaign and has voiced his support for cryptocurrencies, advanced 15%.  With the uncertainty surrounding the election — which showed the candidates closely matched in opinion polls — the prospect of favorable regulation for crypto industry under Trump could be a new catalyst for a bull run, said André Dragosch, head of research in Europe at Bitwise.  “A more pro-crypto stance among U.S. regulators will likely allow a more diverse set of investment opportunities such as ETFs,"" Dragosch told CoinDesk. ""There are still several spot crypto ETFs waiting for the SEC’s approval, including spot ETFs on Solana and XRP. Cryptoasset service providers will be freer to operate and will likely face less pressure by regulators, i.e. the so-called 'Operation Chokepoint 2.0' will likely end.”  Bitcoin has generally performed very well after past U.S. elections, regardless of the outcome, he said.  ""That being said, a Trump win is bound to accelerate the coming bull run in bitcoin and cryptoassets. The latest U.S. election results imply that the political sentiment has significantly shifted towards a pro-crypto stance in the U.S. and will likely accelerate the mainstream adoption of cryptoassets”.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,James Van Straten,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/06/crypto-equities-surge-more-than-10-as-us-political-uncertainty-diminishes-with-trump-victory,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6e97a751a652645db0ed4ca7165719b161a61bb5-2464x1386.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
35789981,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651772,1730894406,"Bitcoin Whales Playing It Safe? Addresses Holding 1,000+ BTC Decline Ahead Of US Elections","Bitcoin (BTC) whales appear to be offloading some of their holdings ahead of the closely contested 2024 US presidential election. 2% Fall In BTC Held By Whale Addresses In a post on X, crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared that Bitcoin whales – wallet addresses holding a significant amount of BTC – are “dialing back exposure” ahead of what is likely to be a very closely contested US presidential election. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Below $70,000: What Does It Have To Do With Whales And The US Presidential Elections? According to the analyst, there has been a 2% decrease in the number of wallet addresses holding 1,000 or more BTC. Notably, since May, the number of Bitcoin whales was at its highest during mid-October when Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was the overwhelming favorite to emerge victorious. At the time of writing, decentralized prediction markets platform Polymarket gives Trump a 62.7% chance of winning, while Democratic candidate Kamala Harris has a 37.4% chance of becoming the next US president. Bitcoin whales selling some of their BTC holdings as Americans prepare to vote could indicate a cautious approach, possibly to mitigate potential price volatility tied to the elections. Bitcoin Whales Expecting Price Volatility? The selloff might suggest that Bitcoin whales foresee a stricter regulatory environment for digital assets following the elections. This concern may not be unfounded, as the Biden administration has faced accusations of adopting a hostile stance toward the digital assets industry. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Decline Worsens: Could It Be Setting Up for Major Reversal? On the contrary, Trump has repeatedly promised to make the US the “crypto capital of the world” during his election campaign. In addition to the whale selloff, long-term BTC holders appear to be disposing of their holdings. According to recent analysis, more than 177,000 BTC were sold by long-term holders in the last seven days. Another scenario worth considering is that any further decline in whale addresses’ BTC holdings without a corresponding drop in price could indicate that retail investors are stepping up to buy the digital asset. Notably, demand for Bitcoin among retail investors has been on a steady uptrend since September 2024. According to a recent report, retail demand for BTC rose 13% in the past month, reflecting a shift in the market’s risk appetite from risk-off to risk-on. Martinez also brought attention to BTC’s TD sequential on the 12-hour chart and how it is flashing a buy signal. For the uninitiated, TD sequential is a technical analysis indicator used to identify potential price exhaustion points and trend reversals in financial markets. That said, a Trump victory might not be the silver bullet for Bitcoin’s tumbling price, as it is critical for the top digital asset to hold the $68,000 support level to avoid slipping to $63,000. At press time, BTC trades at $69,595, up 1.3% in the past 24 hours.

The company is enhancing its ecosystem with EURC stablecoin growth, a user-friendly smart wallet, and the low-cost Base Layer 2 solution. Despite a challenging Q3, Coinbase remains well-positioned for future growth, focusing on regulatory clarity and expanding into derivatives markets. Last time I covered Coinbase ( COIN ), we delved into the pivot to a subscription-based model and institutional adoption. On that front, the 3Q24 earnings release brought additional progress with the company targeting $2 billion from subscriptions and services in 2024, a significant improvement from $1.4 billion in 2023. In the earnings call , the company revealed further progress in driving utility beyond crypto trading. They see a lot of potential in stablecoins, especially for low-cost transactions like remittances. They also think that Base, their layer 2 solution, will help scale blockchain transactions globally, making them fast and low-cost. Deep dive on recent initiatives Coinbase launched EURC , the company's Euro stablecoin, on Base. In Q3, EURC's market capitalization doubled, making it the largest euro stablecoin. With this, the company tapped into the global market beyond the USD, opening the door to other currencies, which will increase utility for users globally. They have also introduced a smart wallet to make the onboarding process easier. Coinbase's wallet doesn't rely on recovery phrases; instead, it uses passkeys or biometrics. Traditional smart wallets were a barrier to adoption, given the history of forgotten passphrases and loss of funds. Finally, Base, the company's Layer 2 protocol, is reducing transaction costs to under $0.01 with near-instant transactions. One of the main advantages is the use of common names instead of complex wallet addresses. Financial performance Coinbase posted revenues of $1.2 billion for Q3; transaction revenue was down 27% sequentially from the previous quarter, mostly due to the reduced volatility in crypto assets and an 18% decline in trading volume. Sequentially, subscription and service revenue is down 7%, with the bright spot being stablecoin revenue. The company has been betting on stablecoins through product updates for advanced traders. Coinbase On the expense side, total operating expenses are also down 6%, in part due to lower transaction expenses and gains on crypto held for operations. With that, net income was $75 million, also impacted by an unrealized loss in their crypto investment portfolio. Coinbase Looking ahead, the company expects some revenue headwinds stemming from the Ethereum price decline in October, due to products like staking that depend on the asset value. Additionally, lower interest rates can also be a burden for the company, especially in the interest-sensitive stablecoin segment. Coinbase Business model considerations One of my most important theses regarding this company was that it is on its way to reducing its dependency on trading activity . Nevertheless, the main indication from this earnings release is that the company continues to depend on high volatility and the ensuing higher trading activity as hedge funds, market makers, and other advanced traders join in. As we have seen, once volatility abates, the company's profits follow suit. There is nothing inherently wrong with this business model; its drawback is simply that it is not Wall Street-friendly. Investors prefer to see stability and stickiness in revenue, and this volatility in revenues and profits gives them vertigo. In any case, the company is operating in an expanding sector. One example is that the following year will likely bring regulatory clarity, which might unlock a wider range of assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. It might also enable stablecoins for merchant payments, making it a mainstream payment option globally . Several potential growth avenues are still unexplored in crypto, and Coinbase remains incredibly positioned to take advantage of them. Valuation As the only listed crypto exchange in US markets, Coinbase is in a category of its own. Nevertheless, we can use a set of peers that allow us to contextualize its valuation. For that, I chose a traditional exchange, Nasdaq (NDAQ), a fund manager with close ties with crypto, BlackRock (BLK), and a social media company that has delved into the metaverse, Meta (META). YCharts Looking at the valuation figures for sales and profits, we can see that Coinbase is well within the valuation interval for the peer set. Risks So far, we have framed Coinbase as a company native to digital assets, with much room for improvement, numerous opportunities to explore, and still fine-tuning its business model. Nevertheless, it is important to highlight the risks facing the company. One of the major risks is regulatory uncertainty and the potential cost of compliance. The crypto regulatory framework in the US remains in flux, with much uncertainty. Unfavorable regulations could create substantial compliance costs that might make the company's business model uneconomical and harm some business segments. For instance, the ambition to enter the derivatives market might be hindered by regulatory challenges, while competitors might capture market share faster. Staking, also a significant revenue stream, is under scrutiny, and the company might face constraints in different jurisdictions. On the other hand, Coinbase's revenues are still highly dependent on crypto market volatility. A prolonged bear market or waning interest in crypto trading could lead to lower revenues. There is also exposure to the company's crypto holdings, as asset price declines could reduce the value of its balance sheet. There will likely be competitive pressure on the technology side. Base, the company's Layer 2 solution, is a promising product, but various competing products will likely emerge. Given its technology profile, cyber risks are also a potential issue , and a security breach could even result in lost funds. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, the company has been capable of managing these issues and thriving. Conclusion Investing in this company relies upon a couple of theses that this earnings release has not negated. Revenue diversification as a strategic hedge against low market volatility is still in play and although this wasn't a bright quarter in terms of growth in this segment, the company is still on track to surpass $2 billion in 2024. With a significant effort underway to build a recurring revenue base, the company is improving its ability to navigate crypto's cyclical nature. Then, the company also has a differentiated technological approach by being crypto-native. The company has developed its Layer 2 blockchain solution, which allows seamless integration into the company's platform, while also being friendly from the developer's perspective. Its low transaction fees and ease of use make it a very compelling option . Finally, the expansion to derivatives markets is a very interesting growth opportunity for the company. The MiFID license in Europe should open the doors to 20 additional EU markets, and it should be a compelling solution for institutional clients seeking regulatory-compliant solutions. Given the TAM for crypto derivatives, this could become a major revenue contributor. CCData As we have seen, the growth in revenue has come in waves that are tightly linked to the sentiment in crypto markets. Although the company is trying to create a recurring revenue base, this will take time, and I think the previous pattern of revenue growth in waves will remain for the time being. In that case, and given the immense opportunities surrounding the company's markets, we can illustrate a potential price target in case we see another growth burst. Seeking Alpha For instance, if we use as reference the highest estimate for 2025, considering a 12% growth in shares dilution and a 9.5x sales multiples, we would get the following price target for next year. Author's computations In my view, the thesis for Coinbase is untouched after reviewing the 3Q24 earnings release.

Analyst Predicts 10-Fold Surge To Yearly Peak,"Shiba Inu (SHIB), the popular memecoin, is back in the news after a crypto expert issued a bold projection predicting a tenfold growth in its market capitalization. Zach Humphries outlined certain hopeful variables that might propel SHIB to a market capitalization of $100 billion, bringing its price to $0.000171—a whopping 890% increase over present levels. Humphries, who has built a reputation for his memecoin market observations, feels SHIB’s surge is a real possibility, despite its present low price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mining Costs Spike To Nearly $50K As Miners Look To AI For Survival In his most recent research, Humphries focuses on the factors that he believes are SHIB’s most fundamental assets. Among these are its brand strength, loyal community, and the potential return of retail investors who may be willing to take another risk in the memecoin space. If $SHIB does a 10x from current price levels, we will see the asset hit over a $100B market cap. Here’s why it can happen 🧵 BOOKMARK this. pic.twitter.com/SSfUNO6nIr — Zach Humphries (@Z_Humphries) November 5, 2024 Brand Power & Community Support Humphries believes that SHIB’s excellent brand recognition contributes significantly to its attractiveness. Shiba Inu has made a name for itself in the world of memecoins, thanks in large part to its passionate community. Even after the 2021 rally waned, SHIB supporters remained engaged, helping to keep the organization relevant in a very competitive sector. Humphries claims that this brand strength, paired with SHIB’s established status in the meme token market, provides it an advantage that fresher tokens lack. Humphries also notes that for many first-time investors, a well-known token like Shiba Inu may appear to be a safer bet in the volatile world of cryptocurrency. With increased demand, particularly if the broader cryptocurrency market becomes positive, SHIB’s price and reputation might skyrocket. According to Humphries, this flood of new investment could be what propels SHIB toward its $100 billion goal. Another Analyst Predicts 200% Rise Analyst “World Of Charts” provided a technical forecast alongside Humphries. They observed a new breakout in SHIB, suggesting a 200% increase that might bring it closer to yearly highs. SHIB’s rebound to $0.00001784 has traders hopeful for future gains. $Shib#Shib Already Running In 50% Profit So Far & Now Verge On Another Descending Broadening Wedge Expecting Another 2x Incase Of Successful Breakout https://t.co/YPxA9ByPk3 pic.twitter.com/ftL0x5HsSW — World Of Charts (@WorldOfCharts1) October 29, 2024 World Of Charts now sees that the breakout of SHIB over the key resistance trendline is another stimulus for further growth.

42407309,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZAVwu,1730890800,Is Optimism's 'Superchain' Winning the Ethereum Layer-2 Race?,"Optimism, one of the major layer-2 networks, has managed to get a slew of clients and firms to deploy their own blockchains using its technology, known as the OP Stack.  Part of the strategy to get new networks to use the technology is to give out large sums of OP tokens in the form of grants. Officials within the Optimism ecosystem say those tokens are supposed to help different projects kickstart their building on OP Stack.  Some argue within the ecosystem it's too early to conclude whether OP Stack has won the layer-2 race.  One of the biggest trends of 2023 among the leading layer-2 projects on Ethereum was the emergence of “blockchain in a box,” where the teams encouraged developers to clone their code to spin up new layer 2s.  Now, one project in particular appears to be pulling away as the clear leader. And as is often the case in blockchain development, a crucial factor is the money changing hands behind the scenes.  Optimism, one of the major layer-2 networks, has managed to get a slew of clients and firms to deploy their own blockchains using Optimism’s technology, with the OP Stack, under open-source software licenses.  Optimism’s first major client to come out of OP Stack was Coinbase’s Base — last year. But in recent months, additional projects have broken toward the ecosystem, with Uniswap, Sony and Kraken all sharing plans to deploy new layer-2 networks using the OP Stack.  It's a crucial development in the evolution of the broader blockchain universe, since layer-2 networks stand at the heart of developers' efforts to make transactions faster and cheaper in the Ethereum ecosystem. Ethereum, while the second-largest blockchain after Bitcoin, is currently the leading smart-contracts network — meaning it can handle programs and support applications — and it has become the dominant home for decentralized exchanges and lending platforms. Layer-2 blockchains work like auxiliary networks atop Ethereum, providing a venue for transactions to be executed quickly and at a low cost, and then settled down to the base chain.  Part of the Optimism Foundation's strategy to get new networks to use their technology is to give out large sums of OP tokens in the form of grants. Officials within the Optimism ecosystem claim that those tokens are supposed to help different projects kickstart their building on OP Stack while contributing to Optimism’s Superchain, a network of OP chains that are connected amongst each other, as well as to Optimism’s governance system, which is known as the Collective.  Ultimately, the goal is to reach critical mass — perhaps not unlike the ascendance in the 1980s of VHS over Betamax as the dominant videotape technology.  Kraken's OP token grant  The deal with Kraken came with a sizable grant, which included an allocation of 25 million OP tokens, worth about $42.5 million when CoinDesk broke the news recently. Kraken's network is called “Ink.”  Representatives for World (the recently renamed Worldcoin project), Uniswap and Sony all declined to comment on how many tokens their projects received as part of their packages, but according to Kraken’s Andrew Koller, the creator of Ink, other OP Stack participants also got sizable amounts.  Optimism Foundation officials say they leave it up to the projects to disclose the amounts of their grants.  In an industry that prides itself on transparency, the unwillingness to share how many OP tokens are designated to those chains raises some questions on how big of a factor those grants played into those deals.  A spokesperson with the Optimism Foundation shared with CoinDesk that the Optimism ecosystem has been transparent about their treasury, and that the Kraken deal falls under their “partnerships fund,” which goes “to certain projects to help support initial development of the chain.”  Optimism's Treasury and Grant Breakdown  According to the data as of Sept. 30, there are about 841 million OP tokens designated towards that kind of funding, with just under 480 million OP tokens already committed. That works out to 361 million remaining, or nearly $480 million at the current OP token price of $1.32.  Some smaller projects building layer 2s on the OP Stack have also received tokens. Celo’s governance forum previously disclosed that it would receive up to 6.5 million OP tokens for building on OP Stack, and the Bitcoin-focused BOB project shared that it was still in the negotiating process, but at the time of writing the deal was for about 500,000 OP tokens.  The tokens designated to BOB come from a different grant bucket, given by the Grants Council, which is part of Optimism's DAO. This is separate from the Foundation, and projects looking to scale their projects can apply for these grants with the Council.  Chains can also apply for grants from the Retroactive Public Funding Goods (RPFG) bucket. As of Sept. 30, there’s just shy of 860 million OP tokens under the RPGF bucket, “which goes towards rewarding on-chain impact across Optimism, and the Superchain,” according to a spokesperson at the Optimism Foundation.  Projects like Kraken’s Ink will also be eligible for RPGF funding.  So has Optimism ultimately won the layer-2 race, and does their grant strategy play into it?  The spokesperson at the Optimism Foundation told CoinDesk over email that, “Like many ecosystems in the space, we view grants as ways to support projects and developers, and allocations are earned by achieving agreed-upon growth milestones that are ROI-positive for the whole Collective. We’re all working together to scale the future of Ethereum and when teams in the Superchain are successful, it benefits the entire Ethereum community.” ROI stands for return on investment.  Has OP Stack Won The Layer-2 Race?  Optimism Foundation’s chief growth officer, Ryan Wyatt, told CoinDesk in an interview that “the adoption of OP Stack being the de facto choice for scaling L2s is starting to happen, which is exciting. Whether you want to call that winning or whatever, I don't know.”  The OP token price has fallen a staggering 65% this year, based on pricing from the website DigitalCoinPrice. But that's less than the declines for other major layer-2 tokens, such as Polygon's MATIC, down 70% in 2024, and Arbitrum's ARB, which has slid 72%. Etherum's native cryptocurrency, ETH, is up about 6% year-to-date.  Wyatt added: “Whether we're at a point where it's just a fact that if you're going to launch an L2, you're going to just go with OP Stack, I think it's too early to say. But if any large institutions, companies, are coming into this space, and they want to be an L2, I think you start orienting more like, ‘Why would we not choose the OP Stack?’”  Competitors, like Offchain Labs, the main developer firm behind layer-2 Arbitrum, have taken a different approach in trying to get users to build with its technology.  “There's a strategy that prioritizes announcements, and there's a strategy that prioritizes actually on-chain success and metrics,” Steven Goldfeder, CEO of Offchain Labs, said to CoinDesk “Our strategy is to empower real users and real builders, and build real technology that's empowering new interesting as well as established different use cases of technology.”  As for Kraken’s Ink decision to pick OP Stack, Koller told CoinDesk that the reasoning came down to “what is going to allow me to spend the resources of engineering the most effectively,"" he said.  ""Do I want to worry too much about security and the protocol upgrades, and having to manage that myself, or do I want to be able to use resources effectively and just make good UX, good tooling, and bring our clients on-chain and make the applications?"" Koller said. ""That's really what we cared about.”  He added: “Let's just focus on experience so we don't have to worry about the complexities of running a blockchain. I think that's why Optimism was a clear choice.”  Read more: Kraken Picked Optimism's 'Superchain' After Getting a Pile of OP Tokens  CORRECTION (17:38 UTC): Corrects to show that BOB token grant came from Grants Council, not the RPGF.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | OP,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/11/06/is-optimisms-superchain-winning-the-ethereum-layer-2-race,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1dc17b01c113466c804d29a2483da41543a25d2b-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Additionally, with the SUI token reclaiming the key psychological $2 mark, it has also broken above the $2.18 level, which corresponds to the 100% Fibonacci retracement.

42407324,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZAWhC,1730890089,Dogecoin Golden Cross Appears as Price Probes Key Fibonacci Hurdle,"DOGE's key price averages confirm a golden cross in a sign of strong bullish momentum.  The joke token faces immediate resistance at 21.7 cents, a level that capped gains in March.  Donald Trump's return to the White House has brought cheer to the crypto market, leading to a dogecoin golden cross, a bullish technical pattern suggesting a continued move higher in the meme cryptocurrency.  The golden cross occurs when the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of an asset's price crosses above the 200-day SMA. It's a sign the asset's short-term price momentum is outperforming the long-term trend, potentially evolving into a major bull run.  DOGE's 50-day and 200-day SMAs confirmed the golden cross early Wednesday, as prices jumped over 15% to resistance at 21.7 cents, a level identified as the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the brutal 13-month bear market that ran out of course in June 2022.  The prevalence of the golden cross suggests momentum is probably strong enough to convincingly top the widely-tracked Fibonacci retracement level that capped gains in March and sent prices back to 8 cents by August.  Short-term traders watch the 23.6% retracement level for early signs of trend reversal or strength. Thus, a convincing breakout above 21.7 cents could bring more buyers and shift focus to the October 2021 high of 35 cents.  On the flip side, failing to establish a foothold above that level would weaken the bullish case, potentially yielding a price drop to the 200-day SMA support at 12.75 cents.

The crypto community would still have one to worry about after famous crypto critic Elizabeth Warren defeated pro-crypto candidate John Deaton to win her third term reelection as Massachusetts senator. Multiple sources, including the Associated Press , confirmed the report on Tuesday.The AP shows a landslide victory for Warren, as she has secured 60.3% votes against Deaton's 39.7% after 88% reporting. At press time, the incumbent senator has 1.85 million votes cast for and 1.22 million votes against in the two-horse race.Warren, Deaton Reacts to VictoryReacting to the victory, Massachusetts's incumbent, Senator Warren, applauded the immense support she received during the elections. In a tweet, she stated that she would keep advocating for the ""working people.""https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1854006141811859568Meanwhile, pro-crypto Republican candidate Deaton addressed his proponents early Wednesday, also thanking them for their support. He noted that he was honored to hold his own while running for Senate against ""one of the most entrenched Washington Elites"" and an influential voice in US politics.During the election debate, Deaton criticized Warren's handling of digital assets, including her notorious Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering regulations. In response, the senator defended her policies by stating that they aim to create equal rules for crypto.Notably, Deaton is one of the few candidates supported by the crypto community that didn't win the elections. The attorney in the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit received donations from crypto leaders in his attempt to unseat Warren as Massachusetts' senator.Notable Impact?Despite Warren's victory, pro-crypto representatives occupy a chunk of other US senatorial seats. Report shows that about pro-crypto candidates are leading the race in the ongoing elections, strengthening pro-crypto dispositions in the House and Senate.Furthermore, Donald Trump, who has secured a decisive lead in the presidential election, has promised to tackle the dark regulatory cloud in the US, including firing Gary Gensler on his first day in office. Hence, unnecessary regulatory advocacies from antagonists like Warren may have minimal effect, as the notable levels of governance have representatives who believe in the nascent innovation and would defend its course.",NEGATIVE,없음,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/06/senator-elizabeth-warren-defeats-crypto-friendly-republican-nominee-john-deaton/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=senator-elizabeth-warren-defeats-crypto-friendly-republican-nominee-john-deaton,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Investors can consider buying the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund at a discount to Net Asset Value for diversified exposure. The article reviews fund details, Trump's pro-crypto history, and provides an updated ""fair value"" calculation for BITW shares. With the 2024 general election in the United States in the rearview mirror, markets are now digesting a return to the White House for former-President and current President-elect Donald Trump. There are a variety of ways investors can express the 'Trump Trade.' I've explored one such way the market seems to be playing the former President's re-election recently via Trump Media & Technology Group ( DJT ). A Donald Trump-owned media stock is perhaps an interesting angle. But from where I sit, the best way to trade the end of the Biden administration is to buy industries that were previously out of favor provided a Trump administration can realistically be viewed as more friendly. That is absolutely the setup for the domestic cryptocurrency industry. The question then is how does one play that idea? Investors have no shortage of options. For instance, US-based crypto-businesses are perhaps more likely to thrive under Trump than under Biden and there are several US cryptocurrency businesses that are publicly traded. Investors could also buy the coins/tokens themselves if they're comfortable with digital assets and understand the space. Short of that, one could just buy the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund ( OTC:BITW ) at a discount to Net Asset Value. I've covered this fund a couple times in the past. Most recently in April when I provided readers with a rundown of on-chain data for each of the ten holdings held in fund shares. In this update, we'll briefly review the fund details, assess whether or not cryptocurrencies would truly benefit from a Trump presidency, and get into my adjusted ""fair value"" calculation for BITW shares. Trump's History With Crypto Cryptocurrencies have become somewhat of a polarizing issue in the political landscape in recent years. Pro-crypto advocacy group StandWithCrypto has tracked official statements from notable politicians and assigned grades by individual candidate. Politician Scores (StandWithCrypto.org) The organization has given current President Joe Biden a ""D"" grade while President-Elect Donald Trump gets an ""A."" During this campaign season, Trump took several steps to solidify his standing as the pro-digital asset POTUS candidate including speaking at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, using Bitcoin to pay for food at a bar in NYC, and launching a token affiliated with a crypto-business. While some have viewed this as pandering, the reality is Donald Trump has been friendly to blockchain technology for several years, most notably through his non-fungible token products. As far back as 2022, Trump's team has used Polygon ( MATIC-USD )/(POL-USD) to distribute the former President's NFT collection ""Trump Digital Trading Cards."" These kinds of products, while presumably viewed as silly by most, have helped generate a somewhat large crypto balance attributed to Trump. Arkham Intelligence has Donald Trump's cryptocurrency wallet holdings at $6.1 million - with over $2 million of it held in Ethereum. The point is, Trump's 2024 election win is not a bad thing for the digital asset space if his recent and prior actions are any indication. Thus, if we accept that 'bullish crypto' is a viable way to express a Trump win in the market, BITW is not a bad way to play the 'Trump Trade,' in my view. Fund Details For the sake of comparison, I'm showing BITW fund details versus the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund ( OTCQX:GDLC ). While each of these funds aim to achieve the similar goal of being a more diversified cryptocurrency investment product, I've held the view that BITW is the better product at achieving that objective due to the fact that it holds 10 assets rather than just 5: Details BITW GDLC Expense Ratio 2.5% 2.5% AUM $989 million $521 million Holdings in Fund 10 5 Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) Weight 75.1% 76.8% Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) Weight 16.5% 16.8% Sources: Bitwise, Grayscale, as of 11/5/24 Each fund has a large combined weighting to both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Where BITW does slightly better is in spreading out the remaining AUM over 8 additional assets rather than just 3. As far as fund fees go, both are identical at 2.5% - which I view as far too high for funds that don't generate yields from the Proof-of-Stake assets. Valuation Adjustment Unlike ETFs, BITW and GDLC are both closed-end funds that trade at large discounts to the value of the underlying shares. In past work covering GDLC, I've made the case that GDLC is so bad at being diversified that it's actually a compelling trade as just a discounted Bitcoin proxy. The same is true for BITW. Though given the fact that Ethereum now also has spot ETFs in the United States, I think it's fair to keep that value at par rather than writing it down to zero. Like Grayscale, Bitwise has spot ETF offerings for both ETH and BTC that trade at NAV. So what we have then with BITW is a fund that is offered by a company that has additional products trading at NAV with the same custodian. Asset Asset price Weighting $ Val/Share Adjusted Val Bitcoin $69,312 75.1% $35.43 $35.43 Ethereum $2,419 16.5% $7.78 $7.78 Solana ( SOL-USD ) $165.01 4.2% $1.98 $0.00 Ripple ( XRP-USD ) $0.511 1.6% $0.75 $0.00 Cardano ( ADA-USD ) $0.332 0.7% $0.33 $0.00 Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ) $23.85 0.5% $0.24 $0.00 Bitcoin Cash ( BCH-USD ) $338.94 0.4% $0.19 $0.00 Chainlink ( LINK-USD ) $10.73 0.4% $0.19 $0.00 Polkadot ( DOT-USD ) $3.87 0.3% $0.14 $0.00 Uniswap ( UNI-USD ) $7.07 0.3% $0.14 $0.00 Share Value $47.18 $43.22 Source: Bitwise, author's calculations based on 11/5/24 closing prices In the table above, I'm writing down the value of everything in the fund to zero with the exception of BTC and ETH to create what I've called an ""adjusted fair value"" for BITW shares. Thus, if we're buying BITW purely for the BTC and ETH, BITW shares have a fair value of $43.22. Given the November 5th closing price of $37.50, BITW shares have a real discount of 20.5% and an adjusted discount of 13.2%. This is admittedly an entirely subjective exercise and fair value is whatever the market is willing to pay. BITW, NAV Rate History (Bitwise) But we've seen BITW and other products like it trade at premiums to NAV rather than discounts in the past. In the 5-year chart above, the blue line is the NAV and the green line is the market value of the shares. To be clear, I'm not suggesting BITW will or even should trade at a premium to NAV. I actually think that a small discount is totally justifiable given the management fee. But I believe a simple shift in market sentiment can dramatically change how these types of products change. If/when digital assets start to run in response to a friendly US regulatory environment, there's no reason BITW's NAV rate discount can't close to a smaller figure. I suspect it will do just that. Risks Digital assets are inherently riskier than traditional financial assets due to a multitude of factors; They're typically not backed by physical assets or businesses Many of them lack supply caps and must be staked to provide a real rate of return when adjusted for token emissions The barrier to market entry is virtually non-existent, which can lead to a higher likelihood of scams or fraud Price volatility is generally more intense than what would be expected from stocks or commodities This is not an exhaustive list. As for BITF specifically, the fund is closed end and can trade at a large discount to Net Asset Value without a mechanism for shareholders to redeem the assets in the fund. Just because the fund trades at a 20% discount to NAV currently, that discount rate can get larger. Thus, there are scenarios where the digital assets held by the fund can appreciate in value even while the fund shares themselves decline in price. Beyond that, the 2.5% expense ratio is high in my opinion. Closing Summary Despite the numerous risks to both cryptocurrencies as an asset class and BITW as a fund, I like buying things that I think are undervalued. In my opinion, BITW is a fundamentally more appealing product than its closest peer GDLC. However, that's not even really the best reason to buy shares of BITW. Since BITW is also so heavily weighted to Bitcoin and Ethereum, the 20% discount to NAV represents an opportunity to buy BTC and ETH at a discount to 'fair value' even if we write down the remaining 8% altcoin allocation to $0. In my view, a Trump administration is a positive development for the domestic cryptocurrency industry. While there is likely a US-based crypto-business angle that can be explored by investors, the most straightforward way to express the 'Trump Trade' is through a basket of cryptos. I think doing so at a discount via BITW is a solid play.",POSITIVE,BCH | ETH,BCH | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4733603-bitw-the-trump-trade-at-a-discount?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/35786251.jpeg

Solana continues to outperform ether, making a new cycle high.  The total cryptocurrency market cap hit $2.45 trillion, the most since June.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} surged to an all-time high above $75,000 as Republican Donald Trump looked set to clinch the U.S. presidency. It was recently trading around $74,000 on major crypto exchanges.  The election result was the news bitcoin needed to break through March's record, and the U.S. market's opening could propel the largest token by market cap to even greater heights.  Crypto was one of the biggest winning industries on the Trump triumph, with total market capitalization hitting $2.45 trillion, the highest since June, according to theTradingView metric TOTAL.  ETH/BTC ratio slumps  The widely watched ratio tracking the relative price strength of ether {{ETH}} against bitcoin dropped to its lowest level since April 2021, suggesting a fallout in investor demand for the world’s second-largest token.  The ether-bitcoin trading pair fell under 0.035 early Wednesday, extending year-to-datelosses to more than 34%. Although colloquially called a ratio, ETH/BTC is simply the trading pair of ether against bitcoin on crypto exchanges, which attracts hundreds of millions in daily volumes.  An increase indicates that ether is outperforming bitcoin and vice versa. When the price rises, traders consider a preference for ETH beneficial for riskier assets and Ethereum ecosystem bets. A slide indicates a preference for Bitcoin and blockchains other than Ethereum.  Over the past five years, the ratio has risen from 0.02 to a peak of above 0.08 in early 2022, meaning ETH quadrupled in value relative to BTC at the time. Since then, it's been on decline. Even as BTC set a lifetime high, ether has yet to break through its high from 2021 and is down 46% from its peak.  Year-to-date, bitcoin has returned over 75% to investors, while ether holders have gained just over 14%, according to MarketWatch data.  In addition, bitcoin's market cap approached $1.5 trillion at the high and continues to widen and outperform ether. The spread between bitcoin and ether's market cap hit a new high of $1.16 trillion, which coincided with the ETH/BTC ratio continuing to make new lows.  Solana's another big winner  Solana {{SOL}} also flexed its muscles against ether. The token is up 10% in the past 24 hours, and also made new cycle highs against ether at 0.072.

According to data from DeFiLlama, nearly 30,000 BTC are now locked on Solv Protocol, as the platform's total value locked (TVL) surpasses $2 billion. This record is locked BTC, and the resulting monetary value comes as Bitcoin breaks its all-time high , surging past $75,000 today.Heightened Staking Activity Amid Bitcoin's All-Time HighJust yesterday, Bitcoin dropped to $66,800, triggering widespread FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) in the market. However, by this morning, the premier crypto asset rebounded, surpassing its previous peak of $73,750 and hitting a new high of $75,360. This marked a massive 12.8% rebound within a single day.The surge in Bitcoin's price has directly impacted staking platforms like Solv Protocol, with more Bitcoin holders staking their funds. As of October 16, the amount of staked BTC was 16,340 tokens. By the end of October, this number had increased to 27,000, and as of this morning, it stands at 29,700 BTC — valued at over $2.23 billion at peak prices.Solv Protocol has deployed these Bitcoin assets across ten blockchain networks, with Solv’s SolvBTC product alone accounting for approximately $1.11 billion in value.https://twitter.com/SolvProtocol/status/1854004530112799155Bitcoin in DeFiSolv Protocol simplifies the staking process for Bitcoin holders through its Staking Abstraction Layer, which allows users to access liquid staking tokens (LSTs) such as SolvBTC.BBN. These tokens let users participate in staking while maintaining liquidity, making it easier for them to engage in decentralized finance (DeFi).As Bitcoin’s market capitalization now exceeds $1.45 trillion, Solv is helping to integrate Bitcoin more deeply into the DeFi space. The platform taps into Bitcoin's capital potential, offering services where users can earn rewards by contributing to the financing of blockchain networks.Although the demand for Bitcoin staking is growing, it still lags behind Ethereum-based platforms like Lido , which currently has $25.7 billion in total collateral.Ryan Chow, co-founder of Solv Protocol, pointed out that Bitcoin's staking rate remains much lower than Ethereum’s (28%) but suggested that if Bitcoin’s staking rate were to reach similar levels, it could unlock as much as $330 billion in value.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/06/bitcoin-staking-platform-solv-hits-historic-2-2b-tvl-as-btc-peaks-at-75k/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitcoin-staking-platform-solv-hits-historic-2-2b-tvl-as-btc-peaks-at-75k,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Amid the ongoing U.S. elections and Donald Trump’s lead, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen a sharp rise, coinciding with broader bullish sentiment in the crypto market. Currently priced at $0.00001922, SHIB has marked a 9.41% increase over the past 24 hours.Amid this surge, an analysis by market watcher Alex Clay projects that SHIB could continue its upward movement. His analysis points to the completion of a ""Descending Broadening Wedge"" pattern, suggesting a potential bullish reversal as SHIB's price breaks above a key trend level. Chart by Clay Notably, the ""Descending Broadening Wedge"" pattern is characterized by two diverging trendlines sloping downwards. It often signals a reversal after periods of downtrend. This recent breakout from the pattern places SHIB above a key level identified at $0.00001833.According to Clay, breaking this level improves Shiba Inu's bullish prospects, aligning with the broader market gains where coins like Dogecoin recorded a 22% increase.Target Prices for Shiba Inu In his analysis, Clay identified two price targets for Shiba Inu based on Fibonacci retracement levels. The first target is $0.00003710, aligning with the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level.The second, higher target is $0.00005685, corresponding to the 0.618 Fibonacci level, where increased selling pressure may emerge.AI Predictions from ChatGPT and Google GeminiMeanwhile, AI-driven predictions from ChatGPT and Google Gemini have provided insights into SHIB's potential growth amid Bitcoin’s new all-time highs and the U.S. election climate. ChatGPT forecasts SHIB’s growth under three scenarios: modest growth, an optimistic bull run, and highly favorable market conditions.Under the modest growth scenario, SHIB’s value could rise 5-10 times, reaching between $0.00009555 and $0.0001911. The optimistic scenario projects a 15-20x increase, placing SHIB’s price between $0.00028665 and $0.0003822.In a best-case scenario, ChatGPT suggests a 30x increase, possibly reaching $0.0005733, though this relies on optimal market conditions.Meanwhile, Google Gemini offers a structured price target based on SHIB’s market capitalization. Assuming SHIB’s market cap could reach $100 billion by 2025, Gemini estimates a target price of $0.0001, though it acknowledges that this is speculative.Shiba Inu $2.35B Blockchain Hub for U.S.In related developments, Shiba Inu’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, has proposed the Strategic Hub for Innovation in Blockchain (S.H.I.B.), a $2.35 billion initiative to establish the U.S.’s first blockchain-focused tech center.The proposal, designed to foster innovation and economic growth, includes plans for 20,000 new jobs and an estimated $5 billion annual economic boost.

Derivatives Exchanges Receive 82,000 ETH In Deposits","On-chain data shows derivatives exchanges have just received large Ethereum deposits, something that could lead to volatility in ETH’s price. Ethereum Exchange Netflow Has Seen A Sharp Positive Spike Recently As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the Exchange Netflow for ETH has registered a large spike recently. The “Exchange Netflow” here refers to an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the net amount of ETH moving into or out of the wallets associated with centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric is positive, it means the investors are depositing a net number of tokens to these platforms. How these transactions affect ETH depends on the exchange to which the holders are moving coins. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Threat Of Falling To $63,000 Despite Rising Odds For Trump’s Election Victory In the case of spot exchanges, investors usually make deposits whenever they want to sell, so positive exchange netflows to platforms of this type can lead to a bearish outcome. For derivatives exchanges, which are relevant platforms in the current discussion, the relationship with the price doesn’t tend to be so simple. Holders transfer their coins to these exchanges to open up fresh positions on the derivatives market. As new positions generally accompany some leverage, the overall risk in the sector could be assumed to go up when investors deposit to derivatives exchanges. This can lead to more volatility for the ETH price. A negative Exchange Netflow is usually bullish no matter the platforms involved, as it implies the investors are moving their coins to self-custodial wallets, potentially because they plan to hold into the long term. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Ethereum Exchange Netflow for the derivatives platforms over the last few weeks: As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum Exchange Netflow has seen a large spike into positive territory recently, which suggests the investors have just made large net deposits to the derivatives platforms. The holders have transferred about 82,000 ETH to these exchanges with this net inflow spree. As mentioned earlier, this trend can lead to higher volatility for ETH. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Decline Worsens: Could It Be Setting Up for Major Reversal? It’s hard to say which direction any emerging volatility might take the cryptocurrency in, as other positive spikes in the last couple of months have proven to be a mixed bag. Given that the latest spike has coincided with a plunge in Ethereum’s price, though, a lot of these may be short positions predicting a further decline. If so, a swing to the upside could lead to liquidating these positions, which would add fuel to the rally. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $2,400, down almost 7% over the last week.

The Shiba Inu leader took to X to post a GIF of the famous ‘Left Twix v. Right Twix’ rivalry theme yesterday. However, Kusama did not add any caption to the tweet, leaving Shiba Inu enthusiasts in the dark.https://twitter.com/ShytoshiKusama/status/1853836238899552257Left v. Right Twix For context, Mars Inc. adopted the funny ‘Left Twix v. Right Twix’ theme as a marketing strategy to create engagement around its Twix shortbread biscuit. While the right Twix has chewy caramel atop a crisp cookie, the left Twix features smooth caramel on a crunchy cookie.The promotional campaign requires Twix customers to identify which bar is better. Mars expects Twix customers to taste both bars to make this decision, potentially increasing their sales.A Rivalry? With Kusama posting the Left Twix v. Right Twix campaign, some suggest he might be hinting at a humorous rivalry within the Shiba Inu ecosystem.Despite locking the comment section, several Shiba Inu community members have been reacting to the post through quotes. Some users suggested that one of the Twix is SHIB, while the other represents one of Shiba Inu's ecosystem tokens, like the upcoming TREAT token. However, this remains unconfirmed.In the meantime, Kusama has not provided more insight into the message he intended to pass through the imagery. Irrespective of whether there is an ongoing rivalry in the Shiba Inu ecosystem among existing products or tokens, they are ultimately in synergy to foster the growth of the canine-themed cryptocurrency.Shiba Inu Needs More Work to Earn Respect Notably, Kusama believes more work is needed to drive Shiba Inu’s growth. This requires a combined effort from both the ecosystem team and community members.

Well-known trader ‘unipcs,’ who has been publicly bullish on DOGE and D.O.G.E since earlier this year on Musk’s endorsement, told CoinDesk in an X message today that he expects the two tokens, and bitcoin, to move even higher.  “I especially think the 'Elon factor' is not yet priced in for DOGE,” unipcs said. “There is going to be a media frenzy about Elon and how his aggressively backing Trump and the 'Department of Government Efficiency' narrative could have been a deciding factor for a Trump win, and that's going to end up being a key catalyst that fuels both Dogecoin and the D.O.G.E ETH memecoin much higher.”  “I do believe many are greatly underestimating just how much higher these assets are going to go from here,” unipcs added.  Traders have long perceived Trump’s victory as a bullish catalyst for the industry for his pro-crypto stance and promises to make the U.S. a bitcoin powerhouse. Democrat Kamala Harris, on the other hand, has not made similar promises but said he would introduce regulations to protect certain groups.",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE | SHIB,BTC | DOGE | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/06/dogecoin-rockets-25-as-trump-nears-victory-top-trader-signals-more-gains-ahead,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2cacb0c1dfdaf66121a3b8cab804bf91f5ed1512-720x405.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

35793841,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=100548,1730885637,"As Dogecoin Records 29% Gain, Is a New 52-Week High on the Horizon?","Dogecoin has crossed the $0.20 mark and is eyeing a new 52-week high, recording a massive 29.41% surge in the last 24 hours. With a 29% surge in the past 24 hours, Dogecoin has crossed above the $0.20 psychological mark. The massive surge comes as Bitcoin crosses the $75k mark and Donald Trump leads the U.S. presidential race.As bullish sentiments in the crypto market continue to grow, will Dogecoin create a new 52-week high, crossing above $0.2289 this week? Let's find out. Dogecoin Crosses $0.20In the daily chart, the falling-wedge breakout rally in Dogecoin is continuously gaining momentum. The rising momentum has led to a higher high and higher low formation. Dogecoin has formed three consecutive bullish candles in the past three days, accounting for a 45.83% jump from its 7-day low of $0.1420. Dogecoin Price Chart Currently, DOGE is trading at $0.2072 as it sustains dominance above a critical psychological mark. As the bullish influence grows, the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages give a bullish crossover. Moreover, the MACD and signal lines are avoiding a negative crossover while bullish histograms continue to surge. With increasing buying pressure, the DOGE price reached a 24-hour high of $0.2193. Therefore, the chances of Dogecoin hitting a new 52-week high have increased significantly in recent events.Dogecoin’s Second Flag BreakoutTaking a closer look at the 4-hour chart, Dogecoin shows another bullish flag pattern breakout, which fueled the ongoing rally. The flag pattern breakout has resulted in a massive upswing and crossed the 161.80% Fibonacci level at $0.2031. Dogecoin Price Chart At present, the 4-hour candle shows a lower price rejection as it retests the broken 161.80% level. The long-tailed candle suggests a higher probability of a post-retest reversal, potentially targeting the 261.80% Fibonacci level at $0.24977.Thus, Dogecoin shows a 20% upside potential in the short term. On the other hand, a potential retest of the previous swing high at $0.1797 indicates a 13.53% downside risk.",POSITIVE,DOGE,BTC | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/06/as-dogecoin-records-29-gain-is-a-new-52-week-high-on-the-horizon/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=as-dogecoin-records-29-gain-is-a-new-52-week-high-on-the-horizon,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

This boost brought the total crypto valuation to a multi-month high, with investors eyeing further gains if support levels hold steady. With the election results leaning favorably for Donald Trump , the market saw an influx of buying interest, setting a positive tone across major coins. Traders are now watching for the next resistance level, though some caution remains as profit-taking could slow momentum. Bitcoin ( BTC ) made headlines as it reached a fresh all-time high, reflecting the continued confidence of investors in its growth potential. This milestone underscores the renewed bullish sentiment around the leading cryptocurrency, with many believing it could rise further. However, maintaining this momentum will depend on sustained buying activity. If profit-taking emerges, Bitcoin could pull back to a key support level, which will be critical in keeping the overall outlook positive. Among altcoins, Goatseus Maximus ( GOAT ) stood out as the top performer, soaring over 40% in just a day. This meme coin’s rapid rise shows increased investor interest, especially with the political backdrop boosting overall sentiment. GOAT's momentum positions it to challenge past highs, provided it holds its support level. If it fails, however, the price might retreat, dampening short-term bullish prospects.

The notable crypto industry leader didn’t hold back in his latest tweet after crypto-friendly candidates secured victory in the US elections. In an X update today, Garlinghouse taunted critics who doubted the election of pro-crypto candidates, noting that “the crypto voter is here to stay.”Notably, the November 5 elections were seen as the first crypto election, following the involvement of GOP candidate Donald Trump and other candidates in the US House and Senate. Trump and other candidates actively supported the nascent industry, drawing backing from the crypto community and skepticism from anti-crypto entities.Garlinghouse Congratulates Crypto ChampionsIn the tweet, the Ripple boss expressed excitement over the triumph of “crypto champions” who won their election and reelection bids in their different jurisdictions. He mentioned a few of them in the tweet, including Bernie Moreno, Ritchie Torres, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Andy Barr.Notably, Moreno is a first-time Republican candidate but trumped incumbent Sherrod Brown to win Ohio. In New York, incumbent Senator Torres, who questioned SEC boss Gary Gensler’s non-fungible token securities classification, recorded a landslide victory.Republican and Democratic pro-crypto incumbents Barr and Gillibrand also secured reelections in the US House and Senate. The former represents the Kentucky district, while the latter is a senator in New York.Ultimately, Trump currently secures a decisive lead over the current vice president, Kamala Harris. Meanwhile, data shows that 238 pro-crypto candidates lead in the ongoing election. About 224 US House representatives and 14 senators who are supportive of crypto are leading proceedings in the polls, with some already declared winners.Crypto Market ReactsThe crypto market has reacted positively to the victories of pro-crypto candidates in the US elections. For context, Bitcoin surged past its previous highs to attain a new all-time high above $75,000.Major crypto assets also made moves following extensive gains.

Struggling with dwindling trading volumes and stiff competition from platforms like Blur and Magic Eden, OpenSea’s new version is designed to reignite enthusiasm in the NFT community. The platform’s CEO, Devin Finzer, hinted at the upcoming changes, emphasizing that the team has reimagined OpenSea from the ground up, with fresh features and benefits in store. A teaser video shared by OpenSea announced a waitlist for early access, sparking interest among users. Notably, co-founder Vaibhav “vasa” Saini revealed in a Discord discussion that the new platform will incorporate Bitcoin ( BTC ) Ordinals support, opening up possibilities for more diverse assets. Although Bitcoin Ordinals are a focal point, this is just one part of the new OpenSea experience. Among the expected updates, users may gain access to rewards and incentives , potentially tailored to those holding Gemesis NFTs, a collection initially offered to users of OpenSea Pro, formerly known as Gem. These enhancements seem designed to encourage user engagement and increase marketplace activity, creating fresh momentum for the NFT sector, which has been on a downward trend in recent months. Speculation is also swirling about the possibility of an Ethereum Layer 2 integration , which could boost transaction speed and reduce costs. While OpenSea has not confirmed this, such a move would align it with similar developments in the industry, such as Uniswap's recent Layer 2 solution. Additionally, there’s chatter around a potential native OpenSea token, though this would invite more scrutiny from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has already shown interest in OpenSea’s activities.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/opensea-2-0:-nft-giant-s-big-december-revamp,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/35782218.jpeg

Warren, known for her influence in financial regulation, garnered 73% of the vote in Massachusetts, while Deaton, a Republican challenger and prominent attorney supporting XRP and balanced crypto regulation, secured only 26%. Deaton's campaign was notable for its backing from the crypto community, including endorsements from high-profile figures like Mark Cuban and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. Despite this support, he struggled to attract broader voter interest beyond the digital asset community. His campaign emphasized the risks of ""overregulation"" in the cryptocurrency sector, suggesting it would hinder innovation and weaken the U.S.'s competitive edge. However, traditional voters in Massachusetts remained loyal to Warren , recognizing her extensive legislative experience and reputation as a seasoned politician. Though previously a strong critic of cryptocurrency, Warren's stance on crypto appeared to soften during the campaign. She indicated a willingness to support cryptocurrency as long as it adheres to existing financial regulations. This nuanced approach contrasts with her earlier calls for strict controls, where she highlighted crypto's potential risks to consumers and as a potential vehicle for financial crime. ""I’m all for a cryptosystem if people want to buy and sell crypto. All I ask is they follow the same rules as everyone else,"" Warren said. Her balanced stance may signal a shift in the regulatory tone in Washington , suggesting possible changes in how crypto policy is discussed at the national level. Deaton, though defeated, expressed his commitment to continuing his advocacy for fair crypto regulations. During his concession speech, he offered to collaborate on issues with Warren, suggesting that despite their political differences, they could potentially work together on bipartisan matters. Deaton further emphasized his role in the ongoing Ripple versus SEC case, where the status of XRP remains a central issue. Despite his loss, Deaton’s campaign highlighted the increasing importance of cryptocurrency in U.S. political discussions , with his platform resonating with crypto enthusiasts who see the sector as transformative for the future of finance. This election result reinforces Warren's influence in regulatory matters, particularly on digital assets, yet her recent tone suggests a more open dialogue.

Ethereum's ETH/BTC ratio hit new lows, sparking internal debates on its future direction, focusing on scaling through L2s and maximizing transaction throughput. Solana saw a dramatic increase in usage, with significant DEX trading and memecoin activity, though concerns about wash trading and Sybil users persist. ApeCoin surged 130% in October, driven by the launch of ApeChain, an Ethereum Layer 3 solution, increasing demand for APE within the ecosystem. Bitcoin dominance climbs as ETH/BTC hits new lows. We analyze Solana vs. Ethereum on memecoin, NFT, and wash trading revenues. Please note that VanEck may have a position(s) in the digital asset(s) described below. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) outperformed all major crypto tokens and asset classes again in October, +11% vs. the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, both -1%, MSCI All Country World Index (ACWI), -2%, and the Bloomberg Global Bond Aggregate -3.4% which was its worst month in more than 2 years. Investors flooded into Bitcoin ETPs (+$3.3B), sending Bitcoin's dominance to new highs for the cycle, above 60%. Market breadth was poor, as more than 60% of our watch list fell in October, and small caps continued to underperform, down 9%. Among the winners, high-throughput Layer 1 smart contract platforms outperformed sharply, with APT (+18%), SOL (+10%), and SUI (+15%). Laggards for the month included Near (-23%), Polygon (-19%), and TON (-15%). Some may be surprised to see BTC and ETH volatility fall in October (-11%) and (-4.5%) heading into the election to levels not seen since mid-summer. However, this is directly parallel to the 2020 action. As we have detailed in recent notes, we expect volatility to rise on election night.

Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. While Ethereum's ( ETH-USD ) ETH (+3%) performed well this month relative to most Layer 1s, it continues to fall against Bitcoin, with ETH/BTC down (-9.5%) in October to new cycle lows. Amid the sour price action, some members of the Ethereum community, such as Doug Colkitt and Max Resnick, are pushing for a new direction. Principally, they believe Ethereum should focus on bringing more transactions to its L1 to accrue more value. On the flip side, Ethereum's core development team believes ETH's long-term value accrual comes from ETH being considered money. This group believes Ethereum's scaling through L2s will bring in 100s of millions of users who will need ETH to use the chains. Vitalik Buterin, the unofficial leader of Ethereum's development and strategy, reasserted his roadmap for Ethereum to become a neutral network that can service the world's financial needs. The waypoints towards his ""north star"" include: Scale Ethereum transaction throughput through trust-minimized L2 blockchains Maximize interoperability between L2 blockchains Create cheap, abundant blockspace for L2s to settle to Ethereum Maintain an extensive network of globally distributed, credibility-neutral validators Minimize extractive activities like MEV Build an economic system that prevents the centralization of Ethereum infrastructure. ETH Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Volume Share Hits All-Time Low Source: Artemis XYZ as of 10/30/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. In the near term, Ethereum's roadmap has driven much of its financial activity to lower-cost L2s. Though these L2s charge ETH for transactions, Ethereum's drive to lower fees for these L2s has reduced Ethereum's overall revenues. This dynamic is reflexive, as it causes less demand by users of Ethereum and its L2s to buy ETH. Because ETH is a commodity, its value is derived explicitly from the demand to use it. The above dynamic, along with anemic ETH ETP inflows, have led to ETH's relative price malaise in 2024. ETH's long-term success hinges on attracting substantial L2 activity to use Ethereum's ""blob space"" to accelerate demand growth for ETH. The current amount of L2 activity is around 300 transactions per second (TPS), which has proven inadequate for preventing a shift in the economic take rate between ETH and its L2s. This challenge could persist until an Ethereum L2 goes truly viral. A pivot point might occur when Ethereum TPS grows high enough to increase ETH burn (from fees) enough to offset ETH issuance through inflation. Using the well-crafted Ethereum Scenario Analysis page, we find this point to be a sustained TPS of around 600. This assumes blob space of 3/6 - target/max, and transaction size remains around 112.5 bytes. However, over the next year, Ethereum will likely increase blob space to 4/8 - target/max. At the same time, L2s will add new compression technology to reduce the blob space they use on Ethereum. In fact, on 10/29/2024, Starkware demonstrated a transaction size of just 16 bytes by posting ~176MB for 11M transactions. If we assume that all chains can achieve this feat, combined with the 33% increase in blob space, the target for offsetting ETH issuance through L2s activity will balloon to 3,300 TPS, around 11 times what it is today. Simulation Results of ETH Burn from L2s Simulation Inputs: 150 roll-ups, 22 TPS, 4/8 blob, ETH price $3k, transaction (TX) size 16. Source: Ethereum Blob Simulator as of 10/31/2024. If we assume Ethereum's recent TPS growth rate of 250% is sustained, the point where L2s's blob-driven ETH burn offsets issuance might not be reached until mid-2026. In the meantime, Ethereum is facing strong competition from high throughput blockchains like Solana ( SOL-USD ), Sui ( SUI-USD ), Aptos ( APT-USD ), and others, which will compete for the users that drive these transactions. All the while, Ethereum's L2s are looking to push token value accrual for their own tokens (like OP, ARB, and ZK). The bearish argument for ETH would be that the growth rate for users is challenged, Ethereum's customers are trying to remit less value to Ethereum, and Ethereum is reducing pricing for its blockspace. There are still many reasons to be bullish about ETH in a longer time frame. Ethereum and the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) ecosystem still command a plurality of developer talent and a strong host of L2s, more than 110, seeking to attract new users and fresh developer talent. Ethereum has by far the most institutional adoption, with mainstream financial institutions such as VanEck and Blackrock building tokenized funds and apps. Ethereum is taking more shots on goal due to the vast number of teams trying to build/attract the killer app. Lastly, for all the talk about L2s, they currently pay less than 1% of total ETH gas fees. Any pickup in ETH Mainnet activity would drive fee generation, burn (ETH buyback), and reflexivity to the asset. How Ethereum Can Restore Confidence What are some catalysts that may change the current consensus negativity around ETH? Here are some ideas being floated: Forcing roll-ups to hold ETH to access blob space Strongly encouraging L2s to back their sequencers with ETH instead of the L2 tokens Making Ethereum's execution layer scale to fit more transactions Ethereum L2s' Decentralization Efforts Stage 1 Rollups Now Dominate L2 Total Value Locked (VL) as Base Introduces Fraud Proofs Source: Artemis as of 10/29/2024. While Ethereum continued to debate its future, its L2s had some major announcements. World Coin launched its widely anticipated Mainnet using Optimism's OP stack, which will connect seamlessly to OP Chains. In another win for Optimism's tech, US-based crypto exchange Kraken announced plans to create its Ethereum layer-2 blockchain called Ink. Adding to positive news for Optimism's tech, Ethereum's largest DEX, Uniswap, announced the creation of its own OP stack chain. Uniswap trading comprises ~70% of Ethereum's DEX volumes, and if significant portions of that volume moved to Uniswap's chain, it would be negative for Ethereum. Despite the good news for Optimism's superchain, the collection of blockchains using the OP stack, OP token waffled in October (-0.5%). This is partly due to questions about the OP token's value accrual from the superchain. Another Ethereum L2, Scroll, finally released its much-anticipated SCR token by dropping 7% of supply to its users, but its token's price has sunk (-34%) since its launch on 10/22/2024. The burgeoning ecosystem of Ethereum L2s also made noteworthy strides toward decentralization in October. While L2 solutions have rapidly gained adoption over the past year due to their ability to provide fast and cost-effective on-chain transactions, they have faced increasing criticism for centralization risks-particularly regarding sequencers and operator control. In September, Ethereum founder Vitalik remarked that starting in 2025, he will only publicly mention L2s that have achieved ""Stage 1+"" decentralization; that is, L2 rollups governed by smart contracts instead of its operators. According to Kaito AI, as of October 27th, Vitalik holds the #1 spot on CT (""crypto Twitter"") KOL (""key opinion leader"") mindshare for the previous 7 days and 30 days. According to L2Beat, a research hub dedicated to tracking Ethereum layer 2 technologies, only four rollups have reached Stage 1 decentralization: Arbitrum One, OP Mainnet, dYdX v3, and Zksync Lite. However, dYdX v3 and ZkSync Lite are effectively deprecated, as dYdX has shifted to its Layer 1 on Cosmos (dYdX v4), and zkSync Lite has been largely superseded by zkSync Era, which supports smart contracts and more advanced use cases-but remains a Stage 0 rollup. Unlike Stage 0 rollups, Stage 1 rollups have implemented smart contract governance, fraud-proof systems, and provision for user exits without operator coordination, meaning that users are no longer fully dependent on centralized operators and can remove their funds from the L2 to Ethereum L1 independently. Essentially, Stage 1 rollups reduce the risk of theft, censorship, and other single points of failure, particularly for non-native assets (assets that have been bridged to the rollup). No L2 has yet reached Stage 2, which indicates the full elimination of centralized control by decentralizing the rollup's sequencers (agents responsible for ordering and bundling L2 transactions before submitting them to the L1) and making its fraud-proof systems (processes defending against malicious transactions) permissionless. Just in time to heed Vitalik's urgent call for L2 decentralization, Coinbase's L2 blockchain Base introduced fault proofs on October 30th, marking a significant step toward Stage 1 decentralization. As Arbitrum, Base, and OP Mainnet lead Ethereum L2s by Total Value Locked (TVL), Base's fault proofs mean that Stage 1 networks could soon secure the majority of L2 TVL if Base implements its final criterion: a security council. According to Base's October 30th announcement, the security council-a set of approvers responsible for signing off on Base's smart contract upgrades-will decentralize beyond the Base and Optimism core teams in the coming months. As noted above, the ETH L2 Scroll conducted its native SCR token's first airdrop to decentralize its protocol's governance. As of October 30th, SCR is trading at a $749 million fully diluted valuation. While still a Stage 0 rollup, Scroll stands out for its plans to decentralize its sequencers and prover infrastructure, similar to Arbitrum's ( ARB-USD ) planned BoLD (""Bounded Liquidity Delay"") upgrade. The BoLD upgrade is a key part of Arbitrum's Stage 2 rollup roadmap, aiming to unlock permissionless validation and decentralize its sequencers. Permissionless validation enables anyone-not just a centralized entity-to verify transactions, while sequencer decentralization reduces risks stemming from single-party control over transaction ordering, such as MEV (""Maximal Extractable Value""). Finally, Linea shared its decentralization roadmap this month, outlining plans to introduce on-chain auctions for block proposers and transition to a proof-of-stake model for block validation, allowing any node to participate by staking tokens. By requiring nodes to bid for the right to propose blocks, on-chain block proposer auctions add economic incentives for honest participation, reducing the risks of transaction censorship and MEV. This shift marks Linea's transition from a centralized protocol to a permissionless system, where proof-of-stake validators participate in a QBFT consensus algorithm to confirm transactions. While these steps advance Linea's decentralization efforts, it remains a Stage 0 rollup due to its continued reliance on centralized sequencers and provers, which must be decentralized to achieve Stage 1. Solana Sees Dramatic Increase in Usage In Solana land, SOL's (+10%) strong performance can be traced to a sizable uptick in chain usage. On Solana, DEX trading in October was up 132% compared to September's total. Due to this activity, Solana's blockchain earned its highest monthly revenues from transactions and MEV, which was $150.5M. Part of the run-up in Solana DEX trading stems was spawned by an AI Twitter account promoting a memecoin based on an internet meme from the mid-2000s. This AI account also controls a wallet funded by a donation from the famed Silicon Valley investor Marc Andreessen of the venture capital firm a16z. This AI agent accumulated the memecoin before relentlessly posting about it on X (formerly Twitter). At the time of writing, this ""AI Agent"" was the first to become a millionaire due to its token holdings in the memecoin. Meanwhile, the AI-promoted memecoin has now peaked at $800M in value. Solana vs. Ethereum: Analyzing Memecoin, NFT, and Wash Trading Revenues Solana vs. Ethereum: Share Revenue from Memecoins and NFTs Source: Artemis, Dune, Flashbots, Jito, VanEck Research as of 10/30/2024. The continued success of Solana attracting usership and financial activity has rankled some in the crypto community. On the first count, some contend that most of Solana's documented 111M monthly active wallets, compared to Ethereum's 5.4M, are mostly Sybil (fake) users. On the second view, detractors of Solana's success claim that Solana's on-chain revenue is driven by memecoin trading. It is further supposed that Solana's memecoin activity mainly comprises wash trading rather than organic volume. The naysayers of Solana extrapolate these assumptions to infer that the token performance of SOL is due to revenues derived from suspicious trading. Concerning wallets, it is very difficult to untangle activity stemming from one user controlling many wallets versus more organic activity derived from one user controlling one wallet. We do agree that a very large portion of these wallets are not organic. To assess the ""FUD"" on memecoins, we analyzed recent memecoin activity on Solana and compared it to Ethereum's activity over the same period. Additionally, we compared current Solana and Ethereum activity to peak memecoin activity on Ethereum in the fall of 2021. To contextualize things further, we added NFT trading to the mix, which many crypto detractors formerly cited as an inorganic driver of blockchain fees. We find that memecoin activity on Solana is significant, as around 34.3% of Solana's revenues derive from memecoin and NFT activity. This compares to around 6.6% of Ethereum revenues today and 20.3% of Ethereum Revenues between July and October 2021. We estimate that the wash trading shar e of memecoin and NFT volume is 41.4% on Solana, compared to 28.9% and 44.4%, respectively, for Ethereum in 2024 and 2021. Wash trading is the practice of buying and selling the same asset to create false market activity, inflating trade volumes without real risk or profit. Putting it together, we assess that 14.2% of Solana revenues come directly from wash trading compared to 2% for Ethereum in 2024 and 9% in mid-2021. One important caveat to this analysis is that it assumes that Solana memecoin wash trading generates MEV in line with normal trading. Without MEV on these trades, our estimates would fall by 50%. Solana vs. Ethereum: Revenue Share from Wash Trading Estimates Share of Revenues due to Memecoins + NFTs (%) Memecoin Washing Trading Estimate (%) NFT Washing Trading Estimate (%) Wash Trading Share of Memecoin + NFT Volume (%) Total Share of Revenues due to Wash Trading (%) Solana (last 90 Days) 34.31 41.56 9.50 41.39 14.20 Ethereum (last 90 Days) 6.61 28.95 22.30 28.92 1.91 Ethereum (July - Oct 2021) 20.32 20.32 56.27 44.44 9.03 Source: Artemis, Dune, Flashbots, Jito, VanEck Research as of 10/30/2024. We employed Dune queries of Solana and Ethereum's blockchain to accumulate memecoin and NFT activity over the specified time ranges to accomplish this analysis and. We then used MEV and transaction fee data from Artemis, Jito, and Flashbots to assess each chain's gas fee revenue and MEV. We triangulated these figures to estimate the portion of total blockchain revenues (fees + MEV) sourced from memecoin and NFT activity. For memecoins, we then pulled the total DEX trading activity for Solana and Ethereum. We filtered that activity for wash trading using a threshold value for the ratio of daily trading volume to a coin's market capitalization for a day's trading. If trading volume exceeds that threshold, it is considered to wash trading. We chose 0.05 as the threshold by calculating SOL's average V/MC over the last three months, ~0.0125, and multiplying it by 4, which is our estimation of memecoin volatility relative to that of SOL's. See the table below for sensitivity analysis on memecoin trading labeling. To gauge NFT wash trading on Solana, we used Dune Analyst @tianjinfan's methodology . For wash trading of NFTs on Ethereum, we used the mighty @hildobby's methodology .

We believe Solana's greater amount of memecoin trading and wash trading is due to several factors. Solana is a high throughput chain that prices transactions 1/10,000ththat of Ethereum's transactions. The opportunity cost of wash trading is much cheaper on Solana than on Ethereum. Next, memecoin activity on Solana is more active due to Solana's vibrant ecosystem of applications like pump.fun that simplify memecoin trading. Furthermore, due to Solana's low latency architecture, memecoin trading is a better user experience on Solana than on Ethereum. Finally, we assert that Solana's MEV architecture may drive higher token volumes. This is because Solana's MEV trading is driven by statistics-driven assessments of landing a transaction through submitting many orders for the same trade. Some of these likely land without capturing MEV, and this may juice trading figures higher than on Ethereum, where block building is done through discrete bidding rather than sending a high volume of orders. If one contextualizes a potential SOL ETP among comparable investments, looking at companies like Alibaba, DraftKings, and the CME might be instructive. In Alibaba's case, there was initial skepticism about package volume that may have included 'empty packages' to boost metrics, an issue that underwriter research addressed before BABA's 2014 NYSE IPO. Similarly, DraftKings and the CME derive much of their revenue from speculative trading, with both platforms providing incentives, like reduced fees or rebates, to encourage activity. By contrast, while Solana's transaction volumes include some wash trading and speculative activity, it doesn't incentivize users similarly, as its high activity levels are driven by the blockchain's low-cost, high-throughput design. Solana's on-chain activity is concentrated mainly in memecoins, making it a hub for speculative assets in the crypto world. However, unlike DraftKings, whose business is limited to gambling, Solana has the potential to expand beyond speculation into impactful use cases such as decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) and social media applications. While memecoins contribute significantly to Solana's current revenue, its high valuation-approximately 250x forward revenue-reflects investor expectations for future growth in non-speculative applications. The analysis of Solana's revenue sources is important because it brings to light concerns about our proposed SOL ETP. Since there is reason to believe a significant portion of SOL's revenues are derived from suspicious trading, our ETP prospectus includes significant risk disclosures. That said, we believe this high amount of activity derives from Solana's high-quality user experience and will become a less important part of Solana's revenue base as new activity comes to Solana. Ethereum's transformation should be a guiding light for how Solana's DEX volumes can mature over time to trading fewer meme-related assets. Lastly, to the anonymous Twitter account that keeps clogging our bosses' inboxes and X mentions with complaints and threats on this topic, we would remind him or her that the United States operates under a disclosure-based regulatory regime. The issues above have been addressed throughout the risk factors in our current SOL ETP prospectus. VanEck is indeed taking on issuer liability by proposing to offer the Fund.

October's Notable Performer - ApeCoin (+40.1%) ApeChain Reaches #4 in NFT Trading Volume ~1 Week After Launch Source: Magiceden.us as of 10.29.2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. ApeCoin (APE) experienced a dramatic rise in October, surging over 130% from its lows after Yuga Labs announced the launch of ApeChain's mainnet during ApeFest in Lisbon. Despite a subsequent 40% retracement, APE weekly trading volume jumped by over 1,100%, marking a significant increase in market activity. This heightened volatility and engagement reflect optimism and speculative activity surrounding the new chain's potential. Launched initially as a governance token in March 2022, ApeCoin was designed to decentralize the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) community's involvement in digital art, gaming, and entertainment. During the 2021-2022 NFT boom, BAYC collections became highly valuable cultural assets, reaching six- and seven-figure price points and gaining celebrity endorsements and brand partnerships. However, as the NFT market waned, APE prices fell sharply alongside the BAYC collection's value, with both APE and BAYC experiencing drawdowns of over 95%. Despite this decline, ApeCoin DAO maintained its commitment to long-term incentives, distributing millions of APE tokens for staking rewards. As a result, APE's circulating supply surged from ~292 million to ~753 million tokens, increasing market supply and reducing scarcity. With only ~25% of coins still to be issued, vs. comps averaging 46%, this past context of price depreciation and token oversupply may have the stage for fresh interest spurred by the launch of ApeChain. ~84% of APE's Unvested Supply Goes Towards the DAO, AIP Carve-Outs, and Founding Teams Source: Apecoin.com as of 10/29/2024. ApeChain is built as an Ethereum Layer 3 solution, utilizing Arbitrum's Orbit technology to create a scalable, high-throughput environment tailored to the BAYC community's creative and commercial activities. Unlike other Layer 2 networks that rely on Ethereum (ETH-USD) for gas fees, ApeChain requires APE to power its transactions. This design decision directly increases demand for ApeCoin within the ecosystem, creating a value loop that could sustain token interest if ApeChain gains adoption. With the Banana Bill (AIP-424), ApeCoin DAO has now allocated 100 million APE to commercial agreements and user incentives aimed at over 60 launch partners across gaming, IP, finance, and infrastructure sectors. These incentives are designed to facilitate value-accretive revenue-sharing agreements between the DAO and its commercial partners and to fund dApp user rewards. To enhance user engagement further, ApeChain offers native yield opportunities for APE, ETH, and stablecoins. These yields are funded through the Staking Pool Allocation, Lido's ETH 2.0 staking, and MakerDAO's sDAI, creating a 'sticky' experience that encourages retention. In its first week, ApeChain's top five NFT collections on Magic Eden outperformed other Layer 2 platforms like Polygon, Base, and Arbitrum in trading volume, indicating strong early interest. Sustained success will depend on the long-term effectiveness of these partnerships and user incentives. One of ApeChain's unique features is its ecosystem-driven approach, particularly through its ""Made by Apes"" (MBA) program. MBA brings together over 400 brands that leverage BAYC intellectual property in various industries, from restaurants to music, apparel, and beyond. This extensive community involvement is a testament to the strength of BAYC's brand and network effects. However, the broader crypto market has grown wary of terms like ""community"" due to overuse during the NFT bubble, meaning ApeCoin DAO will need concrete metrics and examples to validate MBA's impact on ApeChain's growth. Looking forward, the success of ApeChain and ApeCoin will hinge on Yuga Labs' ability to scale the ecosystem and execute its roadmap, including the anticipated launch of the Otherside metaverse. While Otherside has not announced a full platform release date, the game is accessible through a monthly series of events called ""Project Dragon,"" where select NFT holders can test gameplay being developed by the Otherside Development Kit (""ODK""). The ODK is a suite of creation tools accessible to players who own Otherdeed NFTs (Otherside's virtual land titles). The ODK enables players to build customized, interoperable user-generated content (""UGC""), making much of the world's gameplay genuinely player-built and self-sustaining. This design strategy echoes UGC-rich social gaming platforms like Roblox and Fortnite but is distinguished by supporting crypto assets. However, like any UGC platform, its success will require sustained developer and player interest, particularly from outside the existing crypto community. ApeChain's unique Layer 3 structure and strategic partnerships may give it a differentiated position within the NFT and social web3 landscape. Nonetheless, risks remain: token inflation could still challenge price stability, and competition from other decentralized networks may limit ApeChain's growth if its key features fail to resonate with users.

Some analysts argue that ETH will continue to lag, possibly underperforming against other assets like Bitcoin, which has shown strong momentum. However, others are optimistic, believing Ethereum is poised for an aggressive rally, especially if it can establish a solid bounce from current lows. Related Reading: Bitcoin Open Interest Dropped Significantly – Investors Cautions Amid US Election Week? Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez has shared a compelling technical analysis, highlighting a correlation between ETH and the S&P 500. According to Martinez, this relationship could signal a substantial upward move for Ethereum, aligning with broader market trends in traditional finance. Martinez’s analysis suggests that Ethereum could be on track for a major breakout if the current setup holds, with a target around the $10,000 mark. As Ethereum trades near a crucial support level, the coming days will be pivotal in determining its direction. With significant upside potential, if a bullish trend takes hold, this moment may define ETH’s trajectory for the remainder of the cycle. Investors are now watching closely, weighing ETH’s next moves against crypto and traditional market cues. Is Ethereum Preparing To Rally? Ethereum (ETH) has been trading precariously around the $2,400 level, with recent dips below this threshold sparking concern among investors hoping for a bullish breakout. This uncertainty has heightened as traders navigate a market riddled with fear, wondering if ETH is about to embark on a long-awaited rally or fall to new lows. Top analyst and investor Ali Martinez has provided an optimistic outlook, sharing a technical analysis on X that suggests Ethereum’s price movements closely mirror those of the S&P 500. According to Martinez, this dip could be the final one before Ethereum experiences a massive upswing, potentially tripling in value to hit the ambitious $10,000 target. Martinez’s analysis taps into broader market sentiment, noting that ETH has shown resilience at key levels and that this correlation with the S&P 500 could indicate strength and stability shortly. As the U.S. election results unfold and the Federal Reserve’s upcoming interest rate decision looms, the potential for volatility remains high. These factors could introduce sharp price swings, driving ETH lower temporarily before it rebounds and gains momentum for a sustained rally.

ETH Testing Crucial Demand Ethereum briefly dipped below the $2,400 mark, a key support level, before rebounding to $2,440. This bounce has given bulls hope, but to maintain upward momentum and challenge the prevailing bearish outlook, ETH must keep rising and target higher supply zones. Critical to this effort will be breaking above the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $2,758—a level that has consistently pushed down price action and acted as a significant resistance since early August. If bulls succeed in reclaiming this EMA, it could mark a shift in momentum, potentially setting up ETH for a stronger bullish trend. However, if ETH fails to hold above $2,400 in the coming days, it risks a deeper retracement. Analysts have identified the $2,220 level as a crucial line of defense.

This week will be pivotal, as holding above these key levels could provide ETH with the stability it needs to stage a more aggressive push upwards.

Crypto has not been a major issue through this election cycle, though Trump, the Republican candidate for president for a third election in a row, did a great deal of outreach to the crypto industry, by speaking at a bitcoin conference, handing out burgers at a crypto bar and otherwise making statements appealing to the industry, including promising to fire Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler. Harris, the Democratic candidate, has on a handful of occasions shared some general comments about supporting the industry but did not delve deeply into her views.  On Wednesday morning, AP's live tracker showed Trump winning Wisconsin to gain another 10 votes in the electoral college for a total of 277. He needs only 270 to secure election. Republicans also won control of the Senate, flipping Ohio, Montana and West Virginia's seats.  During Trump's first term as president, his regulators introduced a controversial wallet proposal that died under the Biden administration, as well as a special purpose broker dealer license that was later finalized under Gensler.  Despite that record, in this campaign cycle Trump has promised to name a new chair to the securities regulator, and vowed that ""Bitcoin will be made in the USA"" on social media and in speeches.  He also promised to free Silk Road developer Ross Ulbricht, who was convicted on multiple charges for creating and operating the dark net marketplace.  Trump enjoyed vocal support from sections of the crypto industry as a result of his outreach, building on the support he already drew after selling multiple waves of non-fungible tokens.  ""Bitcoin is not just a marvel of technology, as you know, it's a miracle of cooperation and human achievement and a lot of relationships that are formed. They just did a meeting, a roundtable, with a lot of the leaders, and it's amazing,"" Trump said at Bitcoin Nashville. ""There's a great camaraderie.""  Trump has also more recently leaned into more authoritarian rhetoric, warning about ""the enemy within"" the U.S. and promising mass deportations over the past few months of his campaign. The former president's economic policies also rely heavily on imposing tariffs on various imports from the U.S.'s trading partners.

In an X post today, the Shiba Inu lead developer unveiled S.H.I.B, which looks identical to Elon Musk’s D.O.G.E proposal. Although both proposals mirror the tickers of the top two meme coins by market cap, they hold different ideas.Difference Between D.O.G.E and S.H.I.B For context, Musk proposed the D.O.G.E (Department of Government Efficiency) initiative to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. The initiative aims to streamline government operations and potentially save trillions of dollars in tax spending. Musk's mention of this proposal on X positively impacted the price of Dogecoin (DOGE). As reported yesterday, the price of Dogecoin soared by 11%, adding $2.5 billion to the asset's market cap after Musk elaborated on the D.O.G.E concept. Weeks after Musk made the D.O.G.E proposal, Shiba Inu’s leader proposed the S.H.I.B initiative. S.H.I.B, which stands for Strategic Hub for Innovation in Blockchain, is Kusama’s proposal to the forthcoming president of the United States. The S.H.I.B initiative proposes that the forthcoming U.S. administration leverage blockchain to boost different sectors of the country, ranging from security to the economy. Kusama believes this help the United States create a ‘Silicon Valley of Crypto.’ Shiba Inu Lead Reminds Upcoming US President About S.H.I.B Proposal Kusama first proposed the S.H.I.B initiative earlier this week in a blog post.

As of 0245 ET, S&P 500 futures ( SPX ) were +1.80% , while Nasdaq 100 futures ( US100:IND ) were +1.62% . Dow futures ( INDU ) were +2.02% . Three of the crucial seven swing states - N.C., Ga. and Pa. - have been called in favor of Trump. As per a live election tracker by the Associated Press , he had secured 267 electoral votes while Harris had 224. Trump needs just three more votes to win. The Republican candidate was already celebrating . ""I want to thank the American people for the extraordinary honor of being elected your 47th president,"" he told supporters in Fla. Trump trades flourished. In the fixed-income markets, U.S. Treasury yields jumped as bonds were dumped. The benchmark 10-year yield ( US10Y ) was up 10 basis points to 4.38%, while the shorter-end, more rate-sensitive 2-year yield ( US2Y ) was up 4 basis points to 4.24%. For more, see how Treasury yields have done across the curve on the Seeking Alpha bond page. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar index ( DXY ) climbed +1.61% to its highest level since July. The currency is expected to benefit from a low-tax and high-tariff environment under a potential Trump administration. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) undoubtedly saw the most dramatic reaction. The world's largest cryptocurrency smashed past the $74K level for the first time ever, and ever so briefly even surpassed the $75K mark. The crypto industry has been embraced by Trump in his election campaign. The three major U.S. stock indexes on Tuesday staged a broad advance , with each ending more than 1% higher ahead of the election count. U.S. equities have been remarkably resilient to the usual volatility that an election year can bring. The 2024 election season has been full of twists and turns and has, at times, been extremely divisive. History shows that the benchmark S&P 500 ( SP500 ) for the most part gains in a year after an Election Day. ""Irrespective of who wins the presidency, strong seasonals favor stocks from now to year-end, especially since a blue sweep is not in the cards. The most likely scenario is a mixed Washington, with leaders on both sides of the aisle needing to compromise to get things done. However, a red sweep is still possible, which will help equities via pro-growth policies that likely incorporate aggressive onshoring ambitions, lower corporate taxes, and a subdued regulatory landscape,"" José Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers, said. ""In conclusion, however, bond yields are critical to watch as investors and traders examine the inflationary, deficit and activity impacts of incoming policies,"" Torres added. The inexorable bull run in U.S. stocks did take a bit of a breather the last two weeks, as some caution finally appeared to seep into sentiment ahead of the election outcome.

This optimism is fueled by expectations of a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment under a potential Trump administration, with predictions of SOL potentially flipping ETH in market cap and reaching $1000.  SOL's price surge was accompanied by a market cap increase to over $85 billion, making it the fourth-largest token by market cap.  Solana’s SOL jumped 17% in the past 24 hours as Donald Trump's lead over Kamala Harris in the U.S. election renewed odds of an exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval for the token soon.  “Markets are still heavily mispricing a republican sweep and upside for the industry is likely much higher than previously anticipated,” Syncracy Capital co-founder Daniel Cheung said in an X post. “SOL ETF likely happens in Q1 2025 putting SOL in a position to flip ETH and even trade at $1000.”  Rennick Palley, founding partner at crypto venture fund Stratos, told CoinDesk in July that SOL was “poised to be the next token with an ETF” as investors widely believe that tokens “won't be viewed as securities by the Trump admin.”  In early July, the Cboe submitted 19b-4 filings with the Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) asking to list VanEck's and 21Shares' potential spot Solana ETFs, which were initially filed in late June.  SOL surged over $185 early Wednesday, reaching a market capitalization of over $85 billion that saw it flip BNB Chain’s BNB to become the fourth-largest token behind bitcoin {{BTC}}, ether {{ETH}} and stablecoin USDT.  BTC rose 8.4%, while ETH added 6% in that period. The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index of the largest tokens by market capitalization, rose by 7%.  Coingecko data shows trading volumes crossed $8.8 billion in the past 24 hours, compared to $3.2 billion over the previous 24-hour period.  The surge came as Republican Donald Trump moved closer to becoming U.S. president, leading most key states and grabbing 240 electoral seats of the 270 needed to helm the country.

42390189,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bbjhED,1730877352,"Crypto Is a Clear Winner With Trump as GOP Takes Senate, Sherrod Brown Loses and Gensler Likely Heading for Door","The crypto sector's need for a friendly U.S. president became less urgent on election night as the Senate shifted toward the Republicans who've promised digital assets legislation.  One of the U.S. lawmakers who stood in the path of crypto legislation, Senator Sherrod Brown, the chair of the Senate Banking Committee, was voted out — thanks in part to the tens of millions that crypto interests spent in his state.  Having $169 million to spend on U.S. congressional elections can produce fast results in Washington, as the crypto sector's campaign-finance blitz this year helped rid it of a powerful Democratic senator who stood in the way of legislation and also populated Congress with a large number of new friends.  With former President Donald Trump securing enough electoral votes to return to the White House, the industry could also — for the first time — have an outspoken ally in the presidency. A commander-in-chief who calls himself the ""crypto president"" and promised to remove SEC Chair Gary Gensler would likely be a boon for the industry, but the gains made earlier in the election had already positioned digital assets with unprecedented advantage.  With the aid of tens of millions the industry spent in Ohio through its Fairshake political action committee, Sherrod Brown's long Senate career is over and a blockchain businessman, Bernie Moreno, will take his place. The loss of Brown, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, also contributed to the Republicans seizing the Senate majority, meaning Brown's committee will have a new GOP chairman who will likely welcome crypto legislation rather than leave it in limbo, as Brown had.  The Senate has been the primary roadblock to legislative progress for crypto measures, such as Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) that passed the House earlier this year, or the long-awaited stablecoin bill that also cleared the House.  ""Sherrod Brown was a top opponent of cryptocurrency and thanks to our efforts, he will be leaving the Senate,"" according to a statement from Defend American Jobs, the Fairshake affiliate that concentrated on supporting Republican candidates or opposing anti-crypto Democrats. Moreno, the statement said, ""prioritizes innovation, protects American economic interests and will ensure our nationals continued technological leadership.""  Congress is now much more likely to be working on legislation in the next session that will overpower the views of officials at the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. If such legislation becomes law, the SEC and CFTC will have to execute it and adopt whatever means it uses to define a crypto security — the question still at the heart of U.S. oversight.  Paul Grewal, the chief legal officer of Coinbase Inc. (COIN), took a moment to post on X during election night to say he hopes the SEC understood the message from voters.  ""On many, many issues, the voters said loud and clear that they want change,"" Grewal wrote. ""Crypto is no exception. Stop suing crypto. Start talking to crypto. Initiate rulemaking now. There's no reason to wait.""  But the crypto industry's new progress doesn't end there. The Fairshake spending — totaling about $130 million in this cycle — helped shepherd a large number of new faces toward Congress on election night. The super PAC's track record was flawless as the counting continued past midnight, with more than 30 of its 58 favored candidates winning their races and none of them losing.  Though the industry leaders that primarily funded the PAC — Coinbase, Ripple and a16z — kept the PAC's origins and management opaque, the group's strategy was clear. Fairshake and its two affiliate PACs weren't concerned with candidates' other politics as long as they'd support crypto-friendly legislation. And the PACs didn't pretend to be doing anything other than whatever it took to get their picks elected, which meant the crypto groups rarely mentioned crypto at all in the colossal advertising purchases they made, and they weren't shy about dumping overwhelming amounts of cash into each chosen race.  The result — which had been previewed by the crypto PACs' predecessor GMI in the 2022 races — was a significant number of candidates winning primaries in districts purposefully chosen because the primary winner's party would be likely to win in the general election. That's why Fairshake's picks performed so well on election night.  The industry's campaign financing also went to current lawmakers that had been working on the industry's behalf already, such as Majority Whip Tom Emmer, a Minnesota Republican, and Ritchie Torres, a New York Democrat.  In the early hours of Wednesday, former President Trump nailed 277 electoral college votes, more than the 270 needed for a return to the White House. The Republican has promised sudden and dramatic help for crypto, including the intention to replace Gensler as SEC chair.  Gensler has earned the ire of the crypto industry for a policy of ""regulation by enforcement"" and his antagonism toward participants. In the absence of clear legislation covering digital assets, the SEC has sued many crypto companies, including crypto exchanges Coinbase (COIN), Kraken and Binance. Only last week, the regulator sent gaming company Immutable a Wells Notice, a notification that the regulator is planning a lawsuit against it.  Still, the White House fight had already become less urgent for crypto. Whatever happens, the Senate will be controlled next year by the party that has crypto support in its platform.  And with at least two dozen freshman, crypto-friendly representatives starting their careers in the House of Representatives in January, the number of members who support digital assets on Capitol Hill is swelling considerably.

35776487,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651760,1730876443,"Experts Forecast Memecoins To Excel No Matter The US Election Results, Here’s Why","As the US presidential election results loom, one analyst is expressing confidence in the continuous surge of memecoins, particularly in the context of the ongoing political landscape. In a recent social media post on X (formerly Twitter), Miles Deutscher asserted that dog-themed and cat-themed cryptocurrencies will continue outperforming the broader crypto market, regardless of whether Donald Trump or Kamala Harris emerges victorious. Dogecoin Leads Memecoins Resurgence On Election Day Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency on the market, is trading near the $70,000 mark, up a modest 2.2% over the past 24 hours, after several failed attempts to break above its all-time high of $73,700 last week. In stark contrast, Dogecoin (DOGE), the leading memecoin by market capitalization, has surged by 12% during the same period, demonstrating the sector’s performance relative to the top ten cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Solana ‘Must Break Descending Resistance’ To Regain Bullish Momentum – Analyst Deutscher suggests that if Trump wins the election, Dogecoin’s positive momentum will likely increase. He cites Trump’s proposed Department Of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative, which he believes will increase Dogecoin’s visibility and liquidity, as a catalyst that could spark a broader rally in the memecoin space. “DOGE as the meme leader will drive attention and liquidity rotation to the broader meme narrative, he asserts.” This enthusiasm could lead to a significant influx of speculative investments, often called “fear of missing out” (FOMO). Increased Crypto Scrutiny Under A Harris Administration? Deutscher further predicts that a Trump victory would spark a rally in altcoins, especially memecoins, which have historically shown strength leading up to elections. Another clear example of this is that the largest tokens in the Solana memecoin ecosystem, Dogwifhat (WIF), Bonk Inu (BONK) and Popcat (POPCAT), saw surges of 6.3%, 8% and 6% respectively, on election day, all of which outperformed the top ten cryptocurrencies in the market. Deutscher also said that with many cryptocurrencies undergoing significant drawdowns as investors de-risked ahead of the election, they would likely experience a pronounced bounce if Trump secures the presidency. Conversely, if Kamala Harris wins, the analyst foresees a different dynamic. The possibility of increased regulatory scrutiny on utility tokens could prompt investors to seek refuge in more speculative assets, such as memecoins. Related Reading: Why Is Dogecoin Going Up Today? Key Drivers Of DOGE’s 10% Surge Deutscher notes that under this scenario, the fear of a crackdown, reminiscent of the operation chokepoint initiatives targeting certain crypto assets, may lead investors to gravitate towards nihilistic alternatives like memecoins. Ultimately, this shift could increase meme coins dominance, especially if traditional sectors like decentralized finance (DeFi) face heightened scrutiny. In this case, Deutscher asserts that investors might shy away from the broader altcoin market, favoring assets that have already demonstrated resilience and strength throughout the year. Based on price action trends, the analyst points out that some memecoins may be perceived as less risky than other altcoins, a sentiment that appears to be gaining traction among retail investors. At the time of writing, Dogecoin trades at $0.1755.

42390184,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bbjgoZ,1730876026,"Polymarket, Prediction Betting Markets Vindicated by Trump's Strong Showing","Polymarket founder Shayne Coplan and the market niche he took mainstream in 2024 can take a victory lap.  Along with Donald Trump, the Republican Party, and the cryptocurrency industry, prediction markets are a clear winner of the U.S. election. The GOP's surprisingly strong showing Tuesday night came as a shock to those who only got their information from mainstream media, pollsters and pundits.  To those who'd been watching the odds on Polymarket, Kalshi, PredictIt and similar betting sites over the course of the year, the results were long within the realm of possibility.  ""The markets were far and away the best forecast of the 2024 election,"" said Koleman Strumpf, a professor of economics at Wake Forest University in North Carolina. ""While pollsters said 'too close to call' (or [Democratic nominee Kamala] Harris is favored), markets identified Trump as the favorite.""  The vindication comes after several weeks in which the mainstream media harped on the theory that Polymarket, which runs on crypto rails and has seen billions of dollars in trading volume this year, was being manipulated by pro-Trump forces to inflate his odds.  ""None of the hysterical claims about how markets would damage democracy or other woes came to pass,"" Strumpf said.  Although the Associated Press (traditionally the gold standard) had not called the race in the wee small hours of the morning Wednesday, Polymarket was giving Republican candidate Donald Trump a 98.8% chance of re-taking the White House, up from about 60% 24 hours earlier.  For most of the late summer and fall, polls were giving the edge – albeit small and sometimes within the margin of error – to Democrats.  But by 1:25 a.m. ET Wednesday, even the New York Times, hardly in the tank for Trump, was giving him a greater than 95% chance of victory. The newspaper's online ""needle"" was forecasting he would win 306 electoral votes – well more than the 270 needed to win.  None of this is to say that polls and other forecasting methods still don't have their place, as even proponents of prediction markets were quick to point out.  ""The lesson is that markets are great and forecasts are an input to those markets,"" said Haseeb Qureshi, a managing partner at Dragonfly (and investor in Polymarket). ""Both are valuable, and in this case they didn't disagree by much. But markets were probably adding in some alpha into the raw forecasts that was missing.""  Aaron Brogan, a lawyer who has studied prediction markets, cautioned against making sweeping conclusions from the fresh data.  ""This outcome is consistent with boththe prediction market accuracy andan unremarkable polling error modestly biasing traditional polling aggregates,"" Brogan said. ""Polling aggregators felt this race could swing either way, so this correct prediction market outcome could easily be the result of pure chance. While this result is vindicating for prediction markets, the hypothesis that highly liquid markets produce reliable election signal[s] is best demonstrated over time across a number of races.""  Nevertheless, participants in these markets could be forgiven for feeling vindicated right now.  ""Prediction markets work,"" said Hart Lambur, co-founder of UMA Protocol, a decentralized oracle service that referees outcomes and disputes for Polymarket.  ""Polymarket (and others) literally 'predicted' that Trump was most likely to win, when traditional polls said the race was a toss-up,"" Lambur said. ""It's [as] simple as that: prediction markets were a better source of information than the traditional polls, and tonight proved it.""

Trump has said he would impose tariffs on Mexico of up to 100%.  Gold trades flat as DXY and yields rise.  The ""Trump trade,"" which comprises of bullish bets in bitcoin {{BTC}}, the dollar index, and bets on higher Treasury yields and lower Mexican peso, is in full swing as the Republican candidate takes a notable lead over Kamala Harris in the presidential race.  Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, surged over 7% during Wednesday's Asian trading hours, setting record highs above $74,000.  The cryptocurrency saw bigger gains in Mexican peso (MXN) terms as the Latin American currency, expected to be hardest hit by Trump's tariffs plans, fell 3% against the USD to 20.7080, reaching the lowest since August 2022. As of writing, the BTC/MXN pair on Binance traded nearly 10% higher at 1.548 million, according to data source TradingView.  The MXN has declined by 27% since March, with most losses stemming from fears that a potential Trump administration would resort to protectionist policies. Early this week, Trump reiterated his intention to impose a 25% tariff on imports from Mexico, one of the U.S.' largest trading partners last year, while warning of a hike to 100% if the country fails to close its border.  ""If they don’t stop this onslaught of criminals and drugs coming into our country, I am going to immediately impose a 25 percent tariff on everything they send into the United States of America,” Trump said, according to Washington Post.  “If that doesn’t work, I’ll make it 50, and if that doesn’t work, I’ll make it 75,” he said. “Then I’ll make it 100,"" Trump added.  Trump has also vowed to renegotiate the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), due for review on July 1, 2026. At press time, Associated Press showed Trump leading the electoral map 230 to Kamala Harris' 210.  ""Mexican Peso is weakening substantially, even before we know what will eventually happen tonight. An indication that we may see very big moves in the event of a Trump win..,"" Robin Brooks, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said on X.  Gold flat, DXY soars  Gold, rising a recent wave of gains, traded largely unchanged at nearly $2,740 per ounce despite fears that Trump's tariff plan could lead to higher inflation.  The upside in the yellow metal was likely capped by gains in the dollar index, which topped 105.00 for the first time since July 9. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note jumped over 20 basis points to 4.46%, denting the appeal of the zero-yielding safe-haven metal. The uptick in the bond could be attributed to fears that Trump tariffs could complicate the Fed's plans to cut borrowing costs.  Tariffs are known to create a ripple effect throughout the global economy by increasing the cost of goods, disrupting international trade, and reducing competition, all of which add to inflationary pressures.  That said, both bitcoin and gold are said to be on a long-term bullish trajectory, courtesy of the ballooning U.S. fiscal debt. Gold has surged 32% this year, outshining the S&P 500's 21% gain by a big margin.

35772251,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651742,1730871006,Analyst Reveals Bitcoin’s ‘Chopsolidation’ Phase Nears End—Are New Highs in Sight?,"Bitcoin market trend may be on the verge of a significant shift, according to a recent analysis shared by CryptoQuant analyst Percival. Percival described Bitcoin’s current phase as “chopsolidation,” a term used to describe a period of minimal directional movement where price consolidation occurs without a clear trend. This period, he suggests, may be drawing to a close, with an imminent market movement expected in the coming weeks. The Chopsolidations metric, as Percival notes, doesn’t predict the direction of Bitcoin’s next move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Offload Over 177k BTC: Is A Price Surge Or Correction Next? Instead, it assesses the exhaustion level of the current trend, helping to determine whether Bitcoin’s price is due for a reversal or continuation. Percival’s analysis highlights that while there are indicators of strength at various points, the market remains divided on Bitcoin’s next direction. So far, some investors believe that recent accumulation is sufficient to push Bitcoin past its all-time high, while others expect a more cautious upward movement or even a potential correction. Assessing Bitcoin’s Support Levels And Potential Price Rebound Percival’s analysis further points to two key periods in September and October where Bitcoin established notable support levels, marked by brief but significant price stability zones. These areas, which he identified as orange zones on his chart (shared above), served as points where Bitcoin’s price “reloaded” — essentially, zones where demand was strong enough to halt price declines temporarily. With the current price hovering near these support levels, Percival suggests that the market may find a new bottom if Bitcoin faces any short-term downward pressure. This support could create a foundation for upward movement in the weeks ahead. The Chopsolidations indicator, according to the CryptoQuant analyst’s breakdown, is showing signs of readiness for a strong trend based on weekly and monthly readings. Although he did not specify a particular directional bias, he noted that the current market strength could be enough to drive Bitcoin’s price upwards if additional demand or a favorable macroeconomic environment aligns with market sentiment. This trend could play out over the short term, where sufficient market activity might lift Bitcoin’s price. Bitcoin Continuous Struggle To Make A Major Move So far, Bitcoin’s price has continued to face a struggle to make a significant move, especially to the upside. Instead, the asset has seen a form of calmness in volatility following its recent decline below the $70,000 price mark. Particularly, at the time of writing, the asset currently trades for $68,721—a price region BTC has remained quite stable for the past 3 days since its most recent decline.

BTC-USD was last +9% at $74,403.29. The world's largest cryptocurrency has received a shot in the arm lately after Trump embraced it as part of his election campaign - a marked departure from President Joe Biden's current government which has cracked down on the sector. Trump in July made an appearance at the annual Bitcoin Conference where he said he wanted to turn the U.S. into the ""crypto capital of the planet and the bitcoin superpower of the world."" The former U.S. President also said he would hold the cryptocurrency in a strategic national stockpile if re-elected. Trump this year became the first-ever major U.S. party nominee to accept donations in bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and other crypto assets. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and the crypto industry in general has received a lot of attention in 2024. At the start of this year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission provided a boost after its long-awaited approval of spot bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) exchange-traded products. Not long after, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) surged to a record high north of $73,000 in March, though it retreated after its last halving on April 19.

Dogecoin Investors Have Been Showing Signs Of FOMO Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has discussed about how the trend in the Total Amount of Holders has been like for the various top coins in the cryptocurrency sector. Related Reading: Dogecoin Analyst Reveals Buying Opportunities At Lower Prices – Details The “Total Amount of Holders” here refers to an indicator that, as its name suggests, keeps track of the total number of addresses on a given network that are carrying a non-zero balance. When the value of this metric rises, it means new investors are joining the blockchain or old ones who had sold earlier are buying back into the coin. The indicator also registers an increase whenever existing users divide their holdings into multiple wallets for purposes like privacy. In general, all three of these factors are simultaneously at play whenever this trend develops, so some net adoption of the asset could be assumed to be taking place. On the other hand, the indicator going down suggests some of the holders have decided to clear out their wallets, potentially because they want to get away from the cryptocurrency. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Total Amount of Holders for Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and other top assets: As displayed in the above graph, most of the assets have registered an increase in Total Amount of Holders recently, but Bitcoin has gone against the grain as its non-zero wallets have declined instead. More particularly, the number one cryptocurrency today hosts 211,500 less addresses compared to three weeks ago, which has brought the metric’s value to 54.38 million. This means that some investors of the asset don’t believe the current rally would continue further, as they have decided to liquidate their holdings at the recent prices. Historically, assets in the sector have tended to be sensitive to investor sentiment, but the relationship has been an inverse one: prices tend to go up when investors are showing FUD, while they go down in times of FOMO. Thus, the recent drop in the Total Amount of Holders may actually prove to be a bullish sign for Bitcoin. From the chart, it’s visible that the metric has shown the opposite trajectory for Dogecoin, as 46,400 addresses with a balance have showed up on the network in the past week alone. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Threat Of Falling To $63,000 Despite Rising Odds For Trump’s Election Victory “This is a sign of traders speculating and gambling on meme coins, even after last week’s local top,” notes the analytics firm. Going by what history tells us, this FOMO may not be the best sign for Dogecoin. DOGE Price Dogecoin has continued its latest bullish push during the last 24 hours as its price has broken beyond the $0.168 mark. Given the FOMO that has been developing, however, this run may not be sustainable.

ETH is rising and might aim for a move above the $2,580 resistance. Ethereum started a fresh surge above the $2,500 resistance zone. The price is trading above $2,500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $2,460 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it settles above $2,580 and $2,620. Ethereum Price Restarts Increase Ethereum price found support near $2,350 and started a fresh increase like Bitcoin. ETH was able to climb above the $2,420 and $2,450 resistance levels to move into a positive zone. It cleared the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,583 swing high to the $2,357 low. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $2,460 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It is also above the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,583 swing high to the $2,357 low. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,580 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,620 level. The main resistance is now forming near $2,650. A clear move above the $2,650 resistance might send the price toward the $2,720 resistance. An upside break above the $2,720 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,750 resistance zone. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,620 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,520 level. The first major support sits near the $2,500 zone. A clear move below the $2,500 support might push the price toward $2,450. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,320 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,350.

BTC was up 7.5% in the past 24 hours, rising sharply in the last two hours alongside Trump’s odds on betting marketplace Polymarket, where punters now give him an 85% chance of winning the U.S. presidency. Traders largely view a Trump win as bullish for the industry compared to Democrat Kamala Harris, who isn’t perceived as overly crypto-friendly.  Part of BTC’s spike could be attributed to a $94 million liquidation of bearish or hedged bets against the asset, Coinglass data shows. In addition, BTC is now trading at a notable premium on crypto exchange Coinbase, indicating renewed stateside demand.  DOGE, meanwhile, has been up nearly 20% since Tuesday, extending 30-day gains to over 65%, making it the best-performing major token.  Futures tracking DOGE recorded over $30 million in short liquidations over the past 24 hours, an unusually high figure, suggesting part of its move was driven by covering losing bets. Open interest, or the number of unsettled futures bets, on DOGE is up to 8.30 billion tokens as of Wednesday compared to 7 billion tokens on Monday — showing brisk demand and expectations of further market movements.  DOGE has generally risen after a renewed endorsement by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk as part of the Republican campaign. Musk has been proposing a Department of Government Efficiency — abbreviated as D.O.G.E; a clear nod to the token — as an agency that will make government spending and monetary planning more effective.  A parody D.O.G.E token on Ethereum is up 77% in the past 24 hours, and is up 500% since a CoinDesk analysis first flagged demand for the memecoin among some traders.  Bullish sentiment for DOGE is showing signs of spilling over to dog-themed tokens, with shiba inu (SHIB), floki (FLOKI) and bonk (BONK) up over 10%. Sector tokens have gained 16% on average, beating a 7.2% rise in the broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) majors index.  Early trends by the Associated Press showed Trump winning Kentucky, Florida, West Virginia, and another four electoral college votes, outpacing his rival Kamala Harris.

It has grown 42% since September and has risen dramatically from 12.7 million addresses at the start of the year. Latest data shows Solana’s steady rise in the crypto sector. The latest growth is due, in part, to memecoins, which have increased trade and user interest. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mining Costs Spike To Nearly $50K As Miners Look To AI For Survival The memecoin craze isn’t the only factor in Solana’s rapid growth. With a total value locked (TVL) of $5.7 billion, the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem made major strides in the third quarter of 2024. With a 26% quarterly increase, Solana became the third-largest DeFi network surpassing Tron. Much of this growth comes from innovative platforms like Kamino. Memecoins Drive Unprecedented Trading Volumes Key to the recent surge in trade on Solana is platforms including Pump.fun, a memecoin generator, and Raydium, a decentralized exchange (DEX). Pump.fun brought in $30.5 million in October; Raydium recorded around $30 billion in trading activity. Particularly those looking for low-cost, high-frequency trades—an area where Solana’s infrastructure shines against more expensive networks like Ethereum—the activity generated by this memecoin has drawn more users to the network. Still, several business leaders are wary. Though memecoins have attracted a lot of attention in Solana, Eden Au, research director at The Block, pointed out that their long-term consequences are yet unknown. Au posits that changing market dynamics and shifting user preferences may impede current progress if fresh utility and attractiveness do not arise beyond memecoins. Solana DeFi Ecosystem Flourishes In addition to the memecoin excitement, Solana’s DeFi network has experienced significant growth. Solana’s DeFi industry, with a substantial $5.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), experienced a 26% growth in Q3, reflecting significant expansion propelled by platforms such as Kamino. Related Reading: Why One Analyst Says Now’s The Time To Buy XRP—Before It Hits $14 Renowned for its loan and trading innovations, Kamino implemented new services that captivated consumers and enhanced Solana’s position in the DeFi ecosystem. Integrations like PayPal’s PYUSD have strengthened Solana’s stablecoin ecosystem, making its programmable transfer features more appealing. SOL Price Target & Resistance Level Over the course of the past month, the value of Solana’s native token, SOL, has increased by around 12%. It is currently selling at $162, figures from Coingecko show. Market observers are currently looking at a resistance level of $185. It is possible that the token’s price will increase even further if it is able to break through this barrier; the expected price targets range from $220 to $240. If SOL is able to maintain its consistency and make the most of its current developments, then the next several weeks will be the determining factor.

Associated Press has Trump leading the electoral map 101 to 71.  Bitcoin's ""Coinbase premium,"" a key metric gauging stateside demand for the leading cryptocurrency, is flashing green again amid reports of an early lead for pro-crypto Republican candidate Donald Trump in the U.S. election.  The ""Coinbase Premium Index"" measures the price difference for bitcoin on Coinbase, which is widely used by U.S. users and many institutional market participants, compared to the off-shore exchange Binance, the leading exchange by trading volume.  The price differential turned positive during Wednesday's early Asian hours and jumped to 0.06, the highest since Sept. 14, according to data tracked by analytics firm CryptoQuant.  Price rallies are said to be more sustainable when the cryptocurrency trades at a premium on Coinbase, reflecting stronger buying pressure from sophisticated traders and stateside institutions.  Bitcoin rose over 7% in Asia, topping the $74,000 mark for the first time as early trends by the Associated Press showed Trump winning Kentucky, Florida, West Virginia, and another four electoral college votes, outpacing his rival Kamala Harris. At press time, Trump leads the electoral map 101 to 71, according to the Associated Press.  On decentralized predictions platform Polymarket, traders now see a 75% chance of Trump winning the presidential election.  In traditional markets, the dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against major fiat currencies, jumped 1.3% to 104.80, reaching the highest since July 30, according to data source TradingView. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note jumped 16 basis points to 4.44%.  The dollar rally likely stems from Trump's plans to impose tariffs across the board, with a 60% duty on imports from China. ""If Trump wins and puts a 60% tariff on China, we'll see a rise in the Dollar unlike anything in the past. China has only one option in response to tariffs: allow the RMB to fall hard and fast. That will pull down all of EM, which is collateral damage in the U.S.-China trade war,"" Robin Brooks, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said on X.  Bitcoin has historically moved in the opposite direction of the dollar.

35759594,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651755,1730854834,"Bitcoin’s Current Price Action Sets Stage For 30% Rally, Says Crypto Analyst","Bitcoin recent price movements amid the US presidential election 2024 have led to its price currently standing at around $69,092, following a drop below the $70,000 level last week. This relatively low volatility has marked a calm period for Bitcoin, allowing it to stabilize in the $68,000 to $69,000 range over the past few days. The steady price trend has prompted analysts to forecast possible upward movement, pointing to various technical patterns and indicators suggesting a potential rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Slide To $65,000 As Critical Support Level Fails – Details 30% Bitcoin Rally In Play Among the analysts forecasting bullish momentum for Bitcoin, a renowned crypto analyst known as Captain Faibik recently shared insights on X regarding a technical pattern called a “Descending Broadening Wedge.” Faibik highlighted that Bitcoin has completed a breakout from this pattern on a weekly chart and is now in a “retest” phase. A Descending Broadening Wedge is typically considered a bullish reversal pattern in technical analysis. The pattern forms as price action creates lower highs and lower lows within diverging trendlines, implying that the downward momentum may weaken. If the price breaks upward through the resistance, it can indicate that the asset will likely see a price surge. Faibik expects a successful retest of the recent breakout of this pattern from BTC and has set a midterm target of $88,000, forecasting a potential 30% increase in Bitcoin’s value by the end of the year. Bullish Divergence And Long-Term Holder Behaviour Alongside Faibik’s observations, another well-known analyst, Javon Marks, pointed to signs of bullish divergence on Bitcoin’s chart. In technical analysis, bullish divergence occurs when an asset’s price makes lower lows while a technical indicator, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), creates higher lows. This divergence can suggest a potential reversal as buying momentum begins to build. According to Marks, this divergence indicates that Bitcoin’s bulls may be preparing for a move, which could translate to regained dominance in the market. Marks’ view supports the possibility of an upward trend in the medium term, even if the short-term market conditions seem uncertain. Meanwhile, IntoTheBlock, a prominent blockchain analytics firm, recently reported interesting trends in Bitcoin’s holder’s balance metrics. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Offload Over 177k BTC: Is A Price Surge Or Correction Next? According to their data, while long-term Bitcoin holders are currently selling, the scale of these sell-offs appears moderate compared to previous bull cycles. In prior cycles, long-term holders often sold more aggressively, signaling a peak in market sentiment. This time, however, the selling trend among long-term holders has been more restrained, which may reflect a cautious approach amid Bitcoin’s current market conditions. IntoTheBlock speculates that this cautious behavior could signal a shift in the cycle dynamics, potentially pointing to a new market phase for Bitcoin.
