42429174,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLsLFh,1528838130,What Twitter Is Saying About Coinbase's Surprise ETC Listing,"Surprise?  That might sum up the reaction among some members of the crypto community Tuesday when U.S.-based exchange startup Coinbase suddenly announced its plans to list ethereum classic (ETC).  Ranking just inside the top 20 cryptocurrencies, ETC traces its origins to 2016 and the collapse of the DAO, an ethereum-based funding vehicle that fell apart following a code exploit. As such, the network is known by some as ""a continuation of the original ethereum blockchain,"" a name bestowed after a code change on ethereum reversed losses stemming from the failed project.  Still, it might be the small size of the market that is grabbing most of the attention.  As of the time of writing, ethereum classic is the eighteenth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization – valued at more than $1.5 billion – according to data from CoinMarketCap, which tracks price developments in the market. However, it's important to note, it's one of the largest by volume (ranking in the top five).  But despite that boost from traders, a scan of reactions on Twitter suggests that a number of market observers were taken aback by the listing announcement, which sparked a 25 percent price increase following the revelation.  In one case, the response was pretty blunt:    $ETC? Really?        — Salmon Addict (@EthereumAddict) June 12, 2018      This observer took criticism to the next level, suggesting that the listing had more to do with spurring user activity, to put it lightly, than anything specifically to do with ETC.  Ripple effect?  Amidst the social conversation, some tried to draw a connection between the ETC listing and the fact that, to date, the exchange hasn't added support for the cryptocurrency XRP. As XRP is the third-largest crypto by market capitalization, much of the surprise stemmed from the fact that Coinbase would move to list a ""lower value"" coin.  Yet the lack of a listing is perhaps unsurprising, given past reports. Back in April, Bloomberg reported that distributed ledger startup Ripple tried unsuccessfully to get the token listed on Coinbase.    This is the dead sea, the saltiest place on earth, second only to the XRP community after coinbase decided to add ETC. pic.twitter.com/iCBDpKxptU        — Crypto฿ull (@Crypto_God) June 12, 2018      On the other hand, those supportive of the token and Ripple's efforts struck optimistic tones as the story spread.    Coinbase plans to add a single coin.        Ripple adds a bank a week to their network.    Who needs who again?$XRP $ETC    — Robert (@outlaw2097) June 12, 2018      Glass half-full  While much of the discussion today centered around what the listing might mean for ETC in the long-term, others rode the social waves by taking a more humorous approach to their commentary.  For example, several observers tied the development to this week's summit between U.S. president Donald Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un.    Rumour has it that one of Kim Jong Un's conditions for denuclearization was Coinbase adding $ETC.        — Emptybeerbottle (@Fullbeerbottle) June 12, 2018        Kim - Trump Agreement leaked$ETC pic.twitter.com/fB0yy5c4aX        — FatihSK87 (@FatihSK87) June 12, 2018      Still, a (small) portion of people in the crypto community decided to stay positive after the announcement.    Doesn't matter if you like $ETC or not, Coinbase adding more coins is bullish for Crypto. Coinbase is one of the biggest fiat to Crypto Ramps in the whole world of Crypto right now, and this is bullish for Crypto overall.

Congress is set to consider yet another proposed mandate for a cryptocurrency study, this time in the area of sex trafficking.  The House of Representatives Financial Services Committee is introducing a new bill today that, if passed and signed into law, would require the director of the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to open a study on ""how virtual currencies and online marketplaces are used to buy, sell, or facilitate the financing of goods or services associated with sex trafficking or drug trafficking, and for other purposes.""  According to a memorandumhttps://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/061418_fc_markup_memo.pdf dated 11 June 2018, U.S. Congressman Juan Vargas penned the Fight Illicit Network and Detect (FIND) Trafficking Act in order to ""improve the efforts of Federal agencies to impede the use of virtual currencies and online marketplaces in facilitating sex and drug trafficking.""This is not the first bill introduced under the Trump presidency that targets illegal sex trafficking online. Back in February, a controversial bill package known as FOSTA- SESTAhttps://www.portman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/files/serve?File_id=1DA519D4-4B37-4C5E-B8B9-4A205C5E488F was passed by the US House of Representatives, which effectively banned online forums from posting ads for sex workers.  The proposed FIND Trafficking Act would launch an examination into cryptocurrencies and their role in potentially enabling the efforts of sex traffickers.  For workers in the regulated adult entertainment industry, cryptocurrencies are playing an increasingly larger role as an alternative method of payment. As previously reported, several sex workers have begun to use bitcoin not only as a transactional currency but as a secure global store of value, in which they can hold their retirement savings.  Moreover, companies like Vice Industry Tokens (VIT) – which issues its own form of cryptocurrency to attract porn viewers and stars – have been gaining ground developing partnerships with Playboy TV and more recently, HoloGirlsVR, the premier provider of virtual reality adult content.  However, with the recent passing of FOSTA-SESTA, platforms like VIT are in danger of violating laws if the platform's content or activities of its users promote paid sex work in any way.  The repercussions of the study proposed in the bill introduced to Congress will be heavily dependent on the outcoming report set to be submitted ""one year after enactment"" to the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs.

42429177,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLsLRh,1528824628,India's Central Bank Stays Mum on Crypto Ban Reasoning,"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has responded to a query about why it moved to block banks from dealing with cryptocurrency businesses earlier this year – but the reply isn't very telling.  Shri Varun Sethi, who presents himself as a ""blockchain lawyer,"" requested clarifications from RBI under the country's Right to Information Act. According to the answers provided, the decision didn't result from any kind of special research or deliberation by the regulator.  For example, officials aid ""no"" when asked whether the central bank had convened a commission to explore the nature and risks of blockchain tech. And while past publications from the RBI reference reports regarding the use of cryptocurrencies for illicit uses, the central bank declined to identify which ones it pointed to.  It also refused to clarify if there were any expert opinions solicited on the matter, if the RBI had collected any information on existing cryptocurrency exchanges in India and if officials made any effort to draft a framework for dealing with cryptocurrencies within the national banking system.  To all these questions, the bank replied that this information is not covered under the Right to Information Act – and as a result, it did not have to provide an answer.  The latest twist comes months after central bank officials in India said that the companies it regulates can't deal with cryptocurrencies. The controversial announcement has since sparked a number of legal challenges which have made their way to the country's Supreme Court.  RBI said at the time that ""entities regulated by RBI shall not deal with or provide services to any individual or business entities dealing with or settling [cryptocurrencies].

42429192,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLsLlh,1528819848,Apple Blocks Crypto Mining Apps On Its Products,"Apple has moved to put a stop to any crypto-mining apps that might be used on its mobile products.  In a recent update, the personal computing company expanded its initial guidelines on cryptocurrencies. Before, the guidelines specified apps facilitating cryptocurrency exchange and/or initial coin offerings (ICOs) must comply with all applicable state and federal laws.  Now, the guidelines specify more than that. In five bullet points, the guidelines run through Apple's policy on wallets, mining, exchanges, ICOs, and rewards that take the form of cryptocurrency.  Most notable among them: the updated policy bars any apps used on an Apple product from mining for cryptocurrencies unless performed ""off device"". The reasoning behind this change seems to be connected to Apple's policies on hardware compatibility, where it reads:  ""Design your app to use power efficiently. Apps should not rapidly drain battery, generate excessive heat, or put unnecessary strain on device resources. Apps, including any third party advertisements displayed within them, may not run unrelated background processes, such as cryptocurrency mining.""  However, as previously reported, comparisons of energy consumption as it relates to mining efficiency are evolving in light of expanding capabilities and capacities –thereby raising the concern over the precedent this ban sets for current and future mining activity.  The updates to Apple's official policy on cryptocurrency also come in light of pre-emptive measures taken by the company in prior years to clamp down on app development facilitating cryptocurrency trade.  Back in 2014, Apple pulled an app by Blockchain that was geared towards bitcoin trading and storage on Apple devices. The year prior, another bitcoin wallet app by a cryptocurrency exchange company known as Coinbase was also de-listed. Apps for those startups have since returned to Apple's online store.  iPhone image via Shutterstock.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MINING | TOKEN SALE,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/06/12/apple-blocks-crypto-mining-apps-on-its-products,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/24554562cae372e0effd504871fc371ada2255ce-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42429182,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLsLVh,1528817709,UN Trade Body Examines Blockchain's Potential in Supply Chains,"A United Nations body that facilitates global trade is examining blockchain and smart contracts to see if they could play a role in its mission.  To that end, the United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT) has just published a white paper – now available for public review – that studies the nascent technology to see if it offers benefits that could impact its work or that of businesses and organizations.  With developing standards for trade facilitation and supply chain automation already a core part of its remit, UN/CEFACT focuses on the ""smart contract, electronic notary and decentralised process coordination"" features of blockchain, rather than its role in powering cryptocurrencies. It further eyes the tech as a possible means to further move away from traditional paper-based processes and also to remove the need for trust in systems such as those used to manage supply chains.  Within the supply chain industry, a number of types of data can be effectively transmitted over blockchains, according to the paper, including insurance, invoicing, consignment and shipping, and bills of lading. It adds that distributed ledgers run by regulators could also store permits and declarations.  While the organization can see ""clear value and use cases"" for blockchain technology, it sees issues too.  The paper reads:  ""Blockchain technology does not solve the interoperability problem that UN/CEFACT standards have always supported. Also, different blockchains are far from equal in terms of the level of trust that participants should place in them.""  However, the paper's authors also see a potential for the organization to help clarify this potential deluge of data, saying that there is ""an opportunity for UN/CEFACT to leverage its existing semantic standards."" While blockchain, as well as other technologies like IoT, can contribute to increased supply chain efficiency, the paper suggests that more work is needed to fully ascertain their potential in facilitating trade mechanisms.  ""It could be very useful to develop a conceptual model of the international supply chain that shows the role of each technology within the broader map of stakeholders, services, and standards,"" according to the authors.  Furthermore, the paper identifies gaps that the agency is ""uniquely positioned to fill.""  The authors go on to suggest that UN/CEFACT work with national delegations and experts and form working groups to develop new technical specifications around the technology.

According to a Reuters report on Tuesday, an unnamed Japanese government official said that the group aims to hold talks around the subject starting on June 24.  The move was apparently initiated by calls for a globally coordinated policy on cryptocurrencies from the world's economic leaders at the G20 meeting in March.  While current non-binding guidelines suggest some money-laundering controls for the industry – including that exchanges should be registered, suspicious activity reported and customers verified – it is currently at different nations' discretion as to whether and how they are implemented.  The FATF talks, according to the report, will also look at the effectiveness of the existing rules, their application to new exchanges and how any new system would work with nations that have banned crypto trading.  Japan – which passed a law in April 2017 recognizing cryptocurrencies as a legal method of payment and also set up a registration system for cryptocurrency exchanges – will take over leadership of the G20 in 2020. Reuters cites the official as saying the country's government intends to push for binding rules for crypto exchanges by 2019 or earlier if possible.  At the G20 meeting in March, member nations present agreed that issues with cryptocurrencies need to be examined, but that more information was required before any regulations could be proposed. As a result a deadline was set in July for recommendations on what data is required.  Further, in a report to the G20 the same month, another intergovernmental body, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), called for cooperation on studying the tax consequences of cryptocurrencies.

But the program ran into roadblocks since there wasn't a local cryptocurrency exchange to provide liquidity (cash for crypto) and most of the bloggers didn't have bank accounts anyway, whereby they could get a global exchange to transfer the converted crypto into.  ""The challenge was how to exchange [bitcoin] to the local fiat currency,"" Forough told CoinDesk.  At the time, Forough and other CTI representatives would accept the women's cryptocurrency and give them cash in return, but this process had its drawbacks.  Forough continued:  ""Even now, when they are saving crypto in any form, there is still the same challenges of how we can exchange them with the local currency or dollars.""  Ether is unlikely to fare much better in these conditions, but regardless, Forough believes exposing the women to ether (and cryptocurrency broadly) has priceless educational value.  ""I personally think it is good to have digital literacy or financial literacy, the knowledge, especially for women in Afghanistan that are limited from accessing a lot of financial resources, such as banks,"" Forough said. ""It's an amazing technology, not only in case of financial aspects but also in terms of using blockchain technology to create different products that could tackle, maybe, one of these [local access] issues.""  Plus, because the Bounties Network doesn't only offer technical assignments (there are translation jobs and other projects on the site), the girls might better engage with the ethereum community as they learn to code.  ""Because it's a task, which you can create for anything with a reward at the end, you could potentially use it for so many different collaborations,"" Simona Pop, head of community at Bounties Network, told CoinDesk.  Case in point, the partnership has launched a MetaMask course for CTI students and will soon create an online store where students can buy and sell the products and services they and their classmates develop in the broader course.  Circular economy  Speaking of what's called a circular economy – whereby the women can be compensated in ether and then use that ether to buy other products – this has been the real problem with crypto adoption in the developing world.  And it's a problem that often requires systemic change.  Whereas Venezuelan cryptocurrency enthusiasts can use bitcoin, ether and even zcash to buy rice, diapers and other essentials online, then have those items shipped to their homes, this isn't the case in Afghanistan, where Forough said the postal service isn't reliable and many roads and houses aren't marked like they are in other parts of the world.  Still, cryptocurrency has gained some traction in the country since Forough first started experimenting with it in 2014.  For instance, a few Facebook pages and other websites show that money traders are looking for more information on accessing cryptocurrency.  But Janey Gak, an Afghan-American bitcoin enthusiast who works with communities in her homeland, isn't super optimistic about the prospects for ether in Afghanistan. People in the country are still asking pretty simple questions about the industry – mostly bitcoin – at this point; and she's only had one Afghan trader ask about ether, she said.  According to her, one thing that could help, though, is if the in-person money sellers, called sarafis, were to start trading cryptocurrencies.  Afghans rarely trust financial institutions or corresponding mobile apps to convert currency, and instead prefer to use sarafis, who deal with the multitude of fiat currencies used across war-torn Afghanistan. And if sarafis got involved, people might move over to cryptocurrency as a long-term store of value rather than putting their savings in gold and other physical goods, which can lead to a number of issues, like they do today, Gak said.  Global access  Still, even with much development to be done in Afghanistan to make it ripe for cryptocurrency adoption, Forough sees the partnership with Bounties Network to give her students an introduction to ether is a beneficial step on a long road towards financial independence.  ""A lot of women are not able to travel to other cities, some families don't want their daughters to travel alone by herself or to work in other cities,"" Forough said, adding:  ""If there are single digit chances for them to work in Herat, there are a million opportunities online.""  Herat is the third-largest city in Afghanistan and home to CTI, although the nonprofit will allow women to take classes or work online, instead of coming into the office. As such, CTI provides them with employment opportunities they might not have in their home cities.  ""I think it's a good thing for our students to do projects online and get paid. It can be very useful for our students, especially our web design students,"" CTI mentor Aalem Daneshyar, whose first experience with cryptocurrency was getting paid in it through a CTI class, told CoinDesk.  Plus, since Forough feels like the broader blockchain industry overlooks war zones like Afghanistan, she hopes teaching these woman how to earn crypto will be the first step in seeing homegrown technological solutions to local challenges.  In Forough's mind, the opportunity to engage with the global economy and become familiar with cryptocurrency wallets might prove more valuable, in the short-term at least, than the digital coins themselves.  ""There are girls in Afghanistan who know how to code,"" Forough said, adding:  ""And they are going to change the future of Afghanistan, their country, by just accessing this 21st-century knowledge.""

According to a report from CoinDesk Korea on Monday, Lee Jong-Gun – who joined Ground X from a UN big data initiative last month – announced the collaboration during the firm's ""Blockchain for Social Impact"" event.  For the effort, Ground X will work with the Seoul Digital Foundation, an organization created by the Seoul Metropolitan Government in 2016 to advance digitization of the national capital's infrastructure.  While Kakao did not provide details of projects that might be developed as part of the initiative, Lee presented several cases where blockchain is being used to solve social issues, such as tracking the temperature during the distribution of heat-sensitive vaccines in developing countries.  At the event, however, Jaesun Han, CEO of Ground X, cautioned that blockchain is not a panacea and projects will likely take a ""hybrid approach,"" with only the necessary parts being put on a blockchain, while the remainder will still reside on legacy systems.

42429193,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLsLrh,1528797623,Dead Cat Bounce? Bitcoin Price Recovery Could be Short-Lived,"Bitcoin (BTC) is looking to regain poise after its drop to two-month lows on Sunday, but the recovery will likely be short-lived, the technical charts indicate.  At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,825 on Bitfinex – up 3 percent from the two-month low of $6,619.  The recovery could be associated with extreme oversold conditions highlighted by the relative strength index (RSI) yesterday and could be extended further in the next 24 hours.  However, crossing $7,000 in a convincing manner will be easier said than done, as the area around the psychological hurdle is packed with key technical resistance lines. Further, the long duration charts have turned bearish, so holding on to gains above $7,000 will be a challenge for BTC's bulls.  Hence, the recovery could turn out to be a dead cat bounce – a temporary recovery in a bear market that is followed by a resumption of the downtrend.  Daily chart  On the way higher, BTC could face stiff resistance at May 29 low of 7,040 (former support turned resistance). Interestingly, the pennant floor (former support) is also lined up at $7,040.  Further, a key Fibonacci retracement level is located around $7,000, as seen in the chart below.  Hourly chart  The 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the latest leg down in prices is $7,008.  What's more, the cryptocurrency is struggling to find acceptance above $6,859 (23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement). The failure to beat a less important Fibonacci hurdle only indicates how tough it could be for bitcoin to scale $7,008 (38.2 percent Fibonacci hurdle).  The bearish moving averages could also complicate the recovery in bitcoin prices. The 50-hour, 100-hour and 200-hour moving averages (MAs) are all trending south indicating a bearish setup.  Meanwhile, the long duration charts are biased to the bears too.  Monthly chart  The bearish crossover between the 5-month and 10-month MA also indicates the tide has turned in favor of the bears.  Weekly chart  As discussed yesterday, the downside break of the pennant pattern has revived the bear market and opened the doors for a drop below the February low of $6,000. The pennant breakdown also adds credence to BTC's bearish close below the 50-week MA in May.  And, last but not the least, the charts also show there is a lot of space to the downside as a major support is seen directly at $6,000 (Feb low). A violation there would open up downside towards $4,496 (100-week moving average) and $3,300 (trendline drawn from the August 2015 low and March 2017 low).  View  A minor corrective rally could be in the offing, but will likely run out of steam above $7,000.  The broader outlook remains bearish with bitcoin likely to test $6,000 in a week or two.  Only a daily close (as per UTC) above the 10-day MA, currently seen at $7,376, would abort the bearish view.

It's a challenge that Haja Networks is taking on with a new database protocol and a database network. Both of these open-source products would enable interoperability between different blockchains and allow users to sell or lease their data to businesses while maintaining control over what information is accessible to third-parties, said CEO Samuli Pöyhtäri.  The startup recently completed a funding round lead by Outlier Ventures and featuring Polychain Capital, BigchainDB and Creathor Ventures. Outlier also joined Haja as a strategic partner. The total amount raised was not disclosed.  Lawrence Lundy, Outlier's head of research, noted that solving interoperability for databases – including blockchains – is key to helping develop the new internet. And the Haja team, composed of former Protocol Labs and IPFS developers, is on its way there with OrbitDB, an open-source database project.  Pöyhtäri told CoinDesk that ""we see a lot of problems with the current web, with data being settled and data being monopolized by companies. There's a problem with data being centralized, there's [infrastructure issues], there's censorship possibilities and it's inefficient.""  As such, he wanted to develop a way to make databases easily communicate while maintaining a trustless, peer-to-peer framework, he said, adding: ""We can't really build the user experiences that we need to [in order] to be able to compete with the current web so that's essentially what we're enabling here, by building decentralized protocols to make data secure in trustless ways.""  This would just be the first step in building the infrastructure to support a decentralized web, he said, adding that this infrastructure would in turn help solve scalability issues, which can help fuel adoption.  According to Pöyhtäri:  ""If we look at the usage of decentralized apps right now, it's pretty bad in a way. I think everybody would like to see a lot more adoption and usage but essentially it's not there. Part of that problem, a big part of that problem, is the scalability problem, which I believe is a topic right now ... with different projects working on it.""

The EU Blockchain Observatory and Forum announced through a tweet on Monday that it is hosting a 90-minute AMA (Ask me anything) session on June 18, to address any concerns from the public about blockchain and the organization's future plan in the emerging space.  The session marks a notable move by the European Union's executive arm to educate the public about the basics of blockchain technology and its real-life applications, according to the session's agenda listed on the Observatory's website.  Formally launched in February by the European Commission and ethereum startup ConsenSys, the Observatory focuses on developing blockchain-based applications, such as for cross-border remittances, that can contribute to the European Single Market.  The European Commission announced in April that it plans to invest around $400 million in blockchain related projects over the next two years, anticipating that the technology is going ""mainstream,"" as CoinDesk has reported.  Earlier this year, Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank also hosted an online session where he addressed questions posted by the public through Facebook and Twitter that related to blockchain and cryptocurrency.

Also notably, the decision to add ethereum classic arrives after some in the industry had questioned Coinbase's asset selection process as ""random, if not altogether dubious.""

42429175,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLsLHh,1528768520,EOS Is Launched But Not Yet Live – Why?,"Visit any EOS Telegram channel and some version of this question will pop up again and again: Is the mainnet live yet?  While the EOS blockchain technically launched on June 10 at 13:00 UTC, the answer to that question is effectively no. That's because the crypto tokens created by Block.one's $4 billion EOS initial coin offering (ICO) are locked up until the network elects 21 ""block producers"" (the equivalent of miners for the new network), and as that still hasn't happened, currently no one can start using EOS just yet.  As it stands, the blockchain will go live if 15 percent of all tokens – an equivalent of 150 million – are ""staked"" in a vote on block producer candidates. Staking tokens allows EOS holders to vote for up to 30 block producers – the groups in charge of verifying transactions – and votes are weighted by how many tokens are staked.  And while this process is currently underway, what we've seemingly learned about blockchain self-governance from the EOS launch is: If people are given time, they will take it.  That magic 150 million tokens could be hit at any time, but so far votes have stacked up slowly, frustrating many Telegram inquirers, and probably plenty of others. Although, there is some evidence that staking is heating up. At the end of June 10, only about 10 million tokens had been staked, but as of this writing on June 11, just over 30 million tokens have been staked.  Still, the platform needs five times as many for the voting process to start.  Kevin Rose, community lead for one of the leading block producer candidates, EOS New York, told CoinDesk that he believes the slow start had something to do with the launch happening late at night in Asia, a continent where several countries have significant numbers of cryptocurrency users.  There seems to be some truth to that, since the next day after the launch (after Asian crypto enthusiasts would have been waking up), the number of staked tokens tripled.  Others, like Vahid Toosi of EOS SW/Eden said he believes there's a psychological barrier – he predicts at 40 million tokens – that needs to be crossed before tokens start flooding in.  But ultimately, many members of the EOS community speculate it's a handful of different precautions investors are taking before staking their EOS tokens – hesitation by holders that have a large quantity of EOS (or whales), the lack user-friendly tools, security concerns and general prudence.  Speaking to that, Kyle Samani of Multicoin Capital, a fund that's bullish on EOS, told CoinDesk:  ""I think voting is rightfully slow. Exchanges are figuring out operations, and whales and funds are going to bend toward being conservative.""  Block.one did not respond to a request for comment.  Whales in waiting  Sure enough, others think those with big money investments in EOS are watching and waiting.  ""I think the whales want to see how the other whales vote so they can swing it their way,"" Toosi said.  Steve Floyd of EOS Tribe, an EOS block producer candidate, believes some of the whales are already trying to swing it their way.  ""Some of these [block producer] candidates in the top 10 came out of nowhere. How they got in the position they are in is pretty obvious – they had a lot of tokens (or access to them) and voted themselves in,"" he said. ""It's a whales' election.""  EOS New York's Rose agrees that there are some new whales picking favorites, but he's also more optimistic about their role, stating that anyone with significant holdings can move the needle, and those that do are looking at taking some cues from the ""wisdom of the crowd"" concept.  Because he told CoinDesk:  ""If they were to make the wrong decision, then people lose faith in EOS and the value goes down.""  Many critics have pointed to the number of large addresses as a sign that EOS is centralized, but these estimates have been somewhat exaggerated.  First, Block.one has a significant portion of EOS tokens but has committed to not staking its tokens and voting on block producer candidates at the start. Plus, some of the biggest EOS wallets are cryptocurrency exchanges that are holding EOS tokens for their users.  Still, it's fair to say large holders dominate the EOS landscape, and as such, many wonder what's keeping those players from staking right away.  Hot and cold  According to some, the lack of sophisticated mechanisms for voting is keeping some investors on the sidelines.  ""The majority of people are waiting for tools to be vetted and confirmed to be safe before jumping onto voting,"" Syed Jafri of EOS Cafe Calgary, a block producer candidate, told CoinDesk.  Indeed, Samani of Multicoin Capital echoed this, saying the venture fund has a policy that its investors always store their private keys – a cryptocurrency equivalent of a password – in cold storage (meaning offline).  ""Right now, the only tool available for voting is in a hot wallet. We will not vote until we vote from a cold wallet,"" Samani said. ""I'm sure many other large holders feel the same way.""  According to Jafri, it's not just about hot or cold wallets. Part of the reason some people are waiting to vote is because, during the blockchain's testing phase, several ""epic"" vulnerabilities were found.  As such, he continued:  ""They want to ensure the chain is safe due to some of the recent vulnerabilities discovered. Trust builds slowly.""  Tough tooling  Beyond just the need for cold storage staking, the messaging around how to stake and vote has been mixed and confusing at best.  As CoinDesk reported  , not long before the vote, there were hardly any options for voting without using the command line, something that will be difficult for non-technical users.  Some more user-friendly tools started to pop up closer to launch, with broad support among insiders forming around a voting tool made by Scatter, but then just as the blockchain went live, a coalition of validator candidates recommended only using command line tool ""CLEOS.""  One group of EOS holders that couldn't use the command line tool if they wanted to are those holding their tokens on exchanges, since they're locked up in the exchange's wallet. Some exchanges have committed to building tools for their users to vote with, but CoinDesk was not able to determine at press time whether or not votes from exchanges were hitting EOS yet.  Many observers might think this one application – for easily staking and voting tokens – would have been good for Block.One to build over the last year, but Rose said Block.one has always said it would take a hands-off approach to the launch, including not building a voting tool.  Looking to sell?  Still, what could be keeping others from voting is a sell strategy.  Right now, EOS tokens are mostly frozen until the mainnet launch because most tokens are sitting in EOS wallets. But EOS tokens on exchanges continue to be able to be bought and sold.  Those eager to sell (including those that might be waiting for the mainnet launch and a possible price pump, or those that want the ability to sell should there be a massive sell-off after the launch) might be keeping tokens on exchanges and not staking them to get around the lock up.  Yet, those token holders might as well vote, since a large-scale sell-off can't happen immediately after the protocol goes live.  That's because once the first slate of block producers are elected, each account will go live on EOS with all but 10 of their tokens staked. While users can move to unstake the rest immediately, the command won't go through for 72 hours.  Since all holdings will initially be staked as if each user had staked and voted, there doesn't seem to be any reason to wait right now.  And once the chain goes live, voting will be continuous, with EOS checking staked votes for the most supported block producers roughly every two minutes. As such, the first block producers elected might not keep their position for very long.  Although it seems these issues are starting to get resolved since stakes seem to be coming in much faster now than before.  ""I think in the coming days the rate at which votes are tallied will be increasing fast,"" Rose said, also pointing to the deeper meaning behind this user-launched blockchain by adding:  ""We're watching a free market machine operate with no leader.""
