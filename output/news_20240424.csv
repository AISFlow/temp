In a comprehensive report, Hougan sheds light on the potential transformations for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. New Investors And ETFs As Catalysts One of Hougan’s key predictions is that Bitcoin’s volatility will significantly decline by 50%. He argues that the entry of new investors through the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) market will drive this decline. Hougan said that as financial advisors, family offices, and institutions enter the Bitcoin market, their different investment behaviors – such as portfolio rebalancing and steady drip investments – could introduce counter-cyclical flows, ultimately dampening Bitcoin’s volatility. Related Reading: Brace For Impact: Worldcoin Team Plans To Sell 1.5 Million WLD Tokens Every Week For 6 Months Hougan’s second prediction revolves around the allocation of Bitcoin in portfolios. He believes that 5% allocations to Bitcoin will become commonplace in target-date portfolios. As BTC’s volatility decreases and becomes more attractive to institutional investors, Hougan expects a rise in typical portfolio allocations. The Bitwise CIO predicts that Bitcoin ETFs will attract over $200 billion in inflows. He highlights their impressive growth and cites their status as the fastest-growing new ETF category of all time. Hougan suggests that the ETF market is still in its early stages, with national wirehouses and institutions just beginning their due diligence. Drawing parallels with the rise of gold ETFs, which experienced year-after-year growth in net flows, he anticipates a similar trend for Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin Price Path Toward $250,000 In an intriguing projection, Hougan suggests that central banks will allocate funds to Bitcoin before the next Halving event. He notes that central banks have historically been significant investors in gold, accumulating substantial amounts of the metal. However, with Bitcoin’s characteristics as non-debt money and its functional advantages over gold regarding payments and settlement, Hougan believes central banks will be increasingly drawn to Bitcoin. Hougan further noted on this matter: There is also an element of game theory here. A major central bank adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset would be a game-changer for Bitcoin and, I believe, would contribute to a dramatic increase in prices. Will one central bank try to front-run the others? Related Reading: Solana Market Cap Skyrockets $11 Billion As Price Jumps 17% – Details Hougan’s final prediction revolves around Bitcoin’s price. He forecasts that Bitcoin will trade above $250,000 by 2028, an increase of nearly 280% from current levels. The Bitwise CIO attributes Bitcoin’s previous exponential growth to its transition from a speculative asset to one with real-world utility. Factors such as declining volatility, improved custody options, low correlations to traditional stocks, enhanced accessibility through ETFs, and growing institutional adoption all contribute to Hougan’s optimism regarding Bitcoin’s future progress. Hougan concluded by stating: With the ETFs launched and gathering assets—and major Wall Street firms lining up behind bitcoin—I suspect the asset will continue to move further into the mainstream. At $250,000, bitcoin would be a $5 trillion asset. Could it go higher? Of course. But $250,000 would represent solid progress between halvings, and I think we’ll see at least that. Currently trading at $64,500, BTC is down nearly 3% in the past 24 hours after retesting the $67,000 mark on Tuesday and failing to consolidate above that level.

42418364,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTgiB3,1713996185,OP_CAT Proposal to Bring Smart Contracts to Bitcoin Finally Gets a 'BIP Number',"A serious attempt to bring Ethereum-like smart contract functionality to Bitcoin called OP_CAT has finally been granted a “BIP number:” 347. This is the first step towards actually launching the long-proposed software upgrade.  “Getting a BIP number does not signal any sort of consensus on the part of the community,"" Ethan Heilman, one of the co-authors of the proposal alongside Armin Sabouri, said in an interview. ""It just makes discussing and writing software around the proposal easier because the proposal now has a unique numeric identifier that everyone agrees on.”  In other words, getting assigned BIP 347 means the argument over the controversial proposal can finally begin in earnest.  On one side are those who want to reserve the Bitcoin network simply for monetary transactions; on the other are those who want to build new things on-chain, of which proponents of OP_CAT are just a sliver.  OP_CAT has a long history in Bitcoin circles. Initially included as one of the first op_codes (essentially programming shortcuts built into Bitcoin), Satoshi Nakamoto himself removed the functionality in 2010 after concerns were raised about excessive memory usage and the possibility of introducing vulnerabilities.  But in recent years, especially following the release of the Ordinals protocol that reinvigorated developers' desire to build on-chain, proponents have returned to OP_CAT as a possible way to increase the amount of things that can be built using Bitcoin. Other proposals include things like Bitcoin developer Jeremy Rubin’s CTV and feature-rich scaling solutions like Stacks and Ark.  See also: Bitcoin L2 Stacks Is Getting a Major Overhaul  Heilman and Sabouri began studying reintroducing OP_CAT in 2022, and first proposed launching it a year later on the Bitcoin Mailing List via a backward-compatible soft fork. The idea would be to redefine and expand upon an existing code called “OP_SUCCESS126,” without having to hard fork the chain.  If the proposal goes through, OP_CAT covenants could enable the creation of more sophisticated applications and multi-signature setups on Bitcoin. It works by introducing “covenants,” or rules that can be established to determine how a specific transaction will function, to Bitcoin.  “Bitcoin allows users to set rules on who and how their bitcoins can be spent. All CAT does is that it joins two values together. So if you have ‘abc’ and ‘def,’ CAT will join these two values together to make ‘abcdef,’” Heilman said, adding that such a basic maneuver isn’t possible today. “The CAT is just shorthand for conCATenate.”  “After the community is confident the software works as designed, we will put together a PR into bitcoin-core. This is where the real fun begins because the question changes from ‘is the software correct?’ to ‘does the Bitcoin community want OP_CAT?,’” Heilman said. “This could be a quick process or it could take years.”  Among the biggest proponents of OP_CAT have been the co-founders of popular Ordinals project Taproot Wizards, Eric Wall and Udi Wertheimer, who created the Quantum Cats inscriptions project as a sort of marketing campaign for Heilman and Sabouri’s proposal.  While Quantum Cats is one of the most popular inscription projects to date, OP_CAT itself is far from universally accepted. There is some speculation, for instance, that despite Heilman and Sabouri submitting their BIP proposal several months ago, it was being held off from approval by lone BIP editor and Bitcoin Core dev Luke Dashjr, who is not alone in his skepticism of recent on-chain experimentation.  On Monday, the Bitcoin community named five additional BIP editors. According to GitHub, OP_CAT's BIP number was assigned by an editor who goes by ""Roasbeef.""  See also: See also: Will Bitcoin's New BIP Editors Streamline Development?  Heilman said that now that OP_CAT has a BIP number, it’s up to the community to determine whether it should move forward.  “Speaking only for myself, at this point I plan to remove myself from the process and let the community debate if OP_CAT is something they want or not want,"" he said.

Behind the scenes, on-chain data also reveals a bullish trend among SHIB investors, with the exchange balance dropping to new lows. Adding to the bullish case is the fact that SHIB’s price has bounced right off the key 0.618 Fibonacci ratio level, otherwise known as the “golden ratio.” These metrics, in combination, are particularly setting up the stage for a price surge that could see SHIB surging in the current market cycle. Exchange Balances For SHIB Hit New Lows According to CryptoQuant’s SHIB analytics dashboard, the total SHIB reserve on crypto exchanges has been on a free fall for the majority of this year. At the time of writing, the SHIB exchange reserve now stands at around 150 trillion tokens, compared to 164 trillion SHIB tokens on February 29. This means the total number of SHIB tokens in crypto exchange reserves has fallen by 14 trillion SHIB in less than two months. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Price Will Reach $100, But This Needs To Happen First The drop in exchange reserve is somewhat of a bullish indicator for SHIB, as it shows that holders are less liable to sell their coins and are instead opting instead to store them in private wallets. This outflow from exchanges has particularly been compounded in the last few weeks, with on-chain data revealing an increase in activity from Shiba Inu whales. An example is a recent accumulation of 237.8 billion SHIB tokens worth $6.9 million by a new whale address. Furthermore, recent price action in recent months has seen the price of SHIB bouncing off the 0.618 Fibonacci ratio level on April 14th, setting up the stage for a golden ratio rebound. This is a key support level according to the Fibonacci tool, and the bounce indicated the start of a major uptrend. SHIB encountered this bounce on April 15 around the $0.00002117 price level after a correction of over 51% from its yearly high of $0.00004400. Shiba Inu To $0.0001? At the time of writing, SHIB was trading at $0.00002702, up by 19% in the past seven days. Interestingly, the SHIB price has increased by over 27% since its bounce above the golden cross to confirm the crypto has fully reversed into a bullish sentiment. Related Reading: XRP Wallets Holding At Least 1 Million Coins Nears All-Time High As Sentiment Improves Fundamentals point to a continued SHIB price surge in the coming days amid mainstream interest and adoption. One of these is the recent $12 million investment raised by the Shiba Inu team to develop a layer-3 blockchain on top of Shibarium. With supply on exchanges diminishing and SHIB building surging after bouncing off a key Fibonacci level, the ingredients are in place for a rebound to $0.00004400 or higher. If SHIB can clear this resistance, it opens up a run toward $0.00008616, which would represent a 218% increase from today’s price.

While some feel pessimistic about the rally slowdown, some analysts believe the flagship cryptocurrency is just getting ready to reach higher notes. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Top Already Here? This Historical Pattern Says So Next Stop: Bitcoin’s “Parabolic Upside” Crypto analyst and trader Rekt Capital considers Bitcoin (BTC) is currently awaiting a period of consolidation. In an X post, the trader highlighted that, during the previous “Halvings,” BTC saw “Re-Accumulation Ranges.” The analyst shared his chart for Bitcoin phases during the “Halving,” which he has previously used to explain BTC was at the “Last Pre-Halving Retrace” before April 19. At the time, the analyst pointed out that the re-accumulation phase was next. Bitcoin went through one during the previous “Halving,” as seen in the chart. The re-accumulation consisted of two consolidation periods followed by the “Post-Halving Parabolic Upside,” which saw BTC reach last cycle’s all-time high (ATH) of $69,000. Bitcoin phases during the ""Halving"". Source: Rekt Capital on X Rekt Capital highlighted that, during this cycle, the flagship cryptocurrency has already experienced five re-accumulation ranges. Similarly to the last cycle, the latest re-accumulation phase seems to have started during the “Pre-Halving Rally” phase. Per the analyst, this will be followed by the “Parabolic Upside” if history repeats itself. Analyst Mikybull seems to share a similar view to Rekt Capital’s, as he highlights that Bitcoin’s “parabolic rally is loading.” The re-accumulation breakout is set to be “explosive,” and “not many are prepared for this,” he added. The analyst explained that “the RSI on a macro scale is at the same level as it was in 2017, which was followed by a huge rally to cycle top.” Based on this, he believes the current consolidation comes from institutions preparing “for a huge rally to cycle top.” Analyst Sets Crucial Level For Bitcoin’s Breakout A day before Bitcoin’s “Halving,” the cryptocurrency faced a correction that shredded 7% of its price in a few hours. BTC went from hovering between the $64,000-$63,000 price range to trading below the $60,000 support zone. Since then, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization appears to have steadily recovered from the drop. Over the weekend, Bitcoin regained the $65,000 support level before testing the $66,000 one, which it reclaimed on Monday. Over the last few days, BTC has hovered between $66,000 and $67,000. However, it has not been able to successfully test the resistance level set at the $67,000 price range. According to the crypto analyst Bluntz, Bitcoin’s most recent performance suggests that the price will continue to move sideways between the $66,000 and the $67,000 range. However, he also considers that BTC is “gagging for a breakout soon,” as the chart displays a bullish pennant pattern forming. Per the analyst, “once we clear 67k,” the whole market will fly above the latest ATH. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $66,665, a 7.5% increase from a week ago and a 66.22% in the last three months.

42418349,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTgi8z,1713990273,Do Kwon's Huge Fine Shows the SEC Is Ratcheting Up Penalties Against Crypto Firms,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is looking to impose its steepest fine yet on a cryptocurrency project, a $5.3 billion penalty for Do Kwon and Terraform Labs, the man and company behind the fatally flawed algorithmic stablecoin that jumpstarted a multi-billion-dollar, industry-wide contagion event when it imploded two years ago.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.     Following a protracted investigation and relatively short two-week trial in New York earlier this month, Kwon and Terraform were found liable for fraud – hiding obvious dangers lurking in the trading scheme that would allegedly keep its UST stablecoin solvent and the unsustainable 20% yields offered by Terraform's Anchor lending platform. Kwon, who was arrested in Montenegro carrying a false passport last year, did not attend the trial. He is currently awaiting extradition either to the U.S. or his native South Korea.  The monetary penalty is not a done deal; a court will decide the final punishment. But what the SEC said it's seeking, according to an April 19 court filing, is to send “an unequivocal message.""  To experts, the gigantic size of the fine is a sign the SEC isn't playing around anymore, as it follows its proposed $1.8 billion penality for Ripple. (And it comes on the heels of the $4.3 billion fine imposed on Binance by a bundle of U.S. regulators, though the SEC was conspicuously absent from that settlement, and prosecutors this week asking for Binance ex-CEO Changpeng Zhao to spend three years in prison.)  “The recent high-profile cases against Terra/Do Kwon and Ripple, with penalties reaching hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars, do signal a change in the SEC's strategy,” University of Pennsylvania assistant law professor Andrea Tosato told CoinDesk in an interview. ""Overall, I would say that it appears the SEC is trying to send the message that … the reward is just not worth the risk.”  While SEC Chair Gary Gensler has been more or less anti-crypto since taking office in 2021, the financial carnage caused by the collapse of Terra, Three Arrows Capital and FTX in 2022 made it a matter of national priority to try to get the industry in order. The Biden administration, for instance, sent out a memo noting that regulating crypto would be a “whole of government” affair.  And so Binance, Ripple and now Kwon and Terraform are feeling the weight of that.  While Terraform lawyers have argued that the U.S. lacked jurisdiction, they are now arguing to cap the fine at $3.5 million. Kwon’s defense council suggested a maximum fine of only $1 million. For its part, Ripple proposed a civil penalty of no more than $10 million, arguing the SEC’s suggested fine was excessive because it was more than 20 times what it had ever collected from a crypto settlement so far.  That’s true, to an extent. The SEC was able to collect over $1.2 billion from Telegram – but almost all of that amount was meant to be returned to investors while the popular messaging company only had to pay a $18.5 million civil penalty. That was in line with Block.one’s $24 million civil penalty in 2019. (CoinDesk is owned by Bullish, which is in turn majority owned by Block.one) In 2022, the year the SEC grossed the most from enforcement actions with $6.4 billion in fines, the average civil penalty was slightly above $9 million.  See also: 'Down Infinite': A Ham-Fisted Attempt to Rehabilitate Do Kwon's Image  So what accounts for the SEC’s seemingly aggressive turn? Rutgers Law School professor Yuliya Guseva suggested it’s likely a confluence of factors including the fact that as crypto projects grow in size, so does the potential for disgorgement. But there’s also the legal strategy of “terrorem,” which, as the latinate word suggests, is meant to cast fear over the industry to incentivize compliance.  “This latter approach indicates that the SEC may be strategic in its choices as it attempts to bring the crypto industry within the ambit of securities law,” Guseva told CoinDesk in an interview.  Disgorgement isn’t actually mentioned anywhere in securities laws, according to Tosato, but has been standard operating procedure since the 1970s as a way to return funds to investors and deter future violations. Civil penalties on the other hand are supposed to follow a rulebook, which includes the degree of unlawfulness, the actual (or potential) harm caused to investors and the extent to which defendants complied with regulators.  However, in practice, this process ""does involve a degree of discretion which the SEC exercises within established legal frameworks,” Tosato added. While ratcheting up the amount firms are fined is definitely meant to send a message to others, Tosato said he doesn’t think the SEC is “especially out of line compared to what it has done in other industries” when it comes to clear-cut cases of fraud and securities violations – of which there are many.  “In my mind, what is different is that the applicability of the regulatory framework in the crypto space is far more uncertain than it is in many industries,” Tosato said. “Recent case law continues to leave many unresolved questions.”  See also: Your Crypto Project Needs a Sheriff, Not a Bounty Hunter | Opinion",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | LUNA | REGULATION | BNB,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/04/24/do-kwons-huge-fine-shows-the-sec-is-ratcheting-up-penalties-against-crypto-firms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0a058bb9b30b94148d52a598360d1fea3b85877a-938x528.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a press release issued Wednesday, the pair developed, marketed and operated the mixer, which ""facilitated more than $100 million in money laundering transactions from illegal dark web markets.""  Samourai overall facilitated around $2 billion in ""unlawful transactions” between 2015 and the present, the release alleged. An accompanying indictment said this figure was calculated by converting the value of bitcoin laundered through the funds to U.S. dollars, based on bitcoin's price ""at the time of each transaction.""  Rodriguez, 35, and Hill, 65, collected approximately $4.5 million in fees for their mixing services, according to prosecutors. Different features had different pool fees, according to the indictment.  The pair are charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. The charges carry a maximum sentence of 20 years and five years, respectively.  Rodriguez was arrested on Wednesday morning and will be arraigned in Pennsylvania today or tomorrow, according to the press release. Hill, Samourai Wallet’s CTO, was arrested on Wednesday morning in Portugal and will be extradited to the U.S.  The Samourai Wallet website, which was hosted in Iceland, has also been seized, and a seizure warrant issued for Samourai’s mobile application to the Google Play Store.  Samourai has been in development since 2015, the DOJ press release said, and Rodriguez and Hill ""encouraged and openly invited users to launder criminal proceeds"" through the mixer, the press release said, citing tweets and private messages. The mobile application has seen more than 100,000 downloads.  ""At Samourai we are entirely focused on the censorship resistance and black/grey circular economy,"" one private message attributed to Hill said. ""This implies no foreseeable mass adoption, although black/grey markets have already started to expand during covid and will continue to do so post-covid…""  The pair sought investors by marketing the same premise – that ""dark/grey market participants"" would be included in their user base, the release said. A screenshot from marketing materials listed ""Restricted Markets"" as a target demographic, alongside online gambling and asset protection.  Wednesday's arrests come as the DOJ prepares for its upcoming trial against Roman Storm, a developer and co-founder of crypto mixing service Tornado Cash. That case is being pursued by the DOJ's Southern District of New York division. Recently, the DOJ's Washington, D.C. unit successfully won a conviction against Roman Sterlingov, the operator of crypto mixer Bitcoin Fog, on money laundering charges.

The analyst also outlined price targets crypto investors can expect these tokens to attain. VeChain Could Rise To As High As $2.5 From the chart Egrag shared in his X (formerly Twitter) post, one could see that he was hinting that VeChain hit $2.5 at its market peak. He also elaborated on how the crypto token will rise to that level by breaking its price action into three targets. The first target was the yellow channel, which he highlighted on the chart. Related Reading: Ripple Vs. SEC Update: Is The Lawsuit Finally Coming To An End With A Settlement? Source: X VeChain is expected to rise to as high as $0.18 when this target is fully achieved. Egrag noted that this will mark the “forging of the MACRO-Bottom.” The second target will see the crypto token rise to almost $0.9. The analyst pointed out that this channel “aligns with the Fib 0.702 & 0.786 levels,” forming what he referred to as the “Mid-Bull-Cycle.” VeChain is expected to rise to as high as $2.5 when the last target is achieved. Egrag remarked that this target aligns with “key Fib levels 1.236, 1.414, & 1.618, suggesting the potential cycle top for #VET.” This isn’t the first time the crypto analyst has laid a bullish narrative for the VeChain token. In February, he predicted that the crypto token could witness a 140x price increase if it repeats its price action from around 2021 when it rose by 14.638%. XRP Run To $1.4 Still In Play Egrag provided his bullish analysis of XRP in a separate X post. He stated that the crypto token’s double formation was giving a “strong bullish signal.” He added that he is confident that the “thrust will soon.” This recent analysis was an update to a previous one where he predicted that XRP would rise to $1.4 soon enough. Source: X Back then, he was also confident that this move to the upside was imminent, noting that the bulls had accumulated all the XRP tokens that the bears had dumped. He urged XRP holders to “stay steady” in anticipation of the life-changing opportunities that may arise due to the crypto token’s parabolic surge. Related Reading: Ethereum Resurgence: TRON Founder Justin Sun Goes On 127,388 ETH Buying Spree Egrag has remained bullish on the XRP token despite its unimpressive price action. He has predicted at different times that the crypto token could rise to as high as $27 at its market top. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at around $0.54, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42418373,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTgiKL,1713980703,The Protocol: Analyzing Runes Impact as Bitcoin Fee Bonanza Fades,"Last week's once-every-four-years Bitcoin halving came and went – just as Satoshi Nakamoto programmed it 15 years ago. But the big surprise was the fast uptake of Casey Rodarmor's new Runes protocol, his second big hit on the original blockchain in two years. Now, it looks like the initial fee bonanza might be fading, and the question is whether Runes transactions will provide a sustainable source of ongoing revenue for miners, especially now that the block rewards have been cut in half. We've got the recap.  ALSO:  Celo team chooses Optimism's OP Stack for new layer-2 chain.  Bitcoin gets new BIP editors, not a moment too soon.  Top picks from the past week's Protocol Village column: Neura, Ankr, Cosmos, Metis, Omni, DODOChain, Alchemy  Blockchain project fundraisings: Turnkey, RunesDEX  Trammell Venture Partners sizes up the Bitcoin VC opportunity.  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Also please check out our weekly The Protocol podcast.  Network news  Chart shows Bitcoin fees spiking dramatically post-Runes-launch, then subsiding somewhat. (BitDigest)  RUNING THE PARTY? Bitcoin's once-every-four-years ""halving"" was supposed to bring a steep cut in revenue for crypto miners, since their rewards for new data blocks would drop by 50%. Instead, the simultaneous launch of Casey Rodarmor's new Runes protocol – for minting digital tokens on top of the oldest and largest blockchain – proved so popular that it caused massive network congestion, sending transaction fees to record levels and showering Bitcoin miners with a windfall like never before. On a halving watch party hosted by Tone Vays, longtime Bitcoin experts expressed astonishment at transaction fees surpassing $2 million in certain blocks, versus a more typical level of less than $100,000. The main questions now are whether the Runes fever will last, and if so how Bitcoin will adapt. BitDigest newsletter circulated a chart (above) showing a steep drop-off in the fees as the initial post-Runes launch subsided. But the community discussion immediately turned to whether the extra traffic might prompt developers to accelerate their quest to build out and improve Bitcoin layer-2 networks. On Monday, one of the more prominent projects, Stacks, rolled out its much-anticipated ""Nakamoto"" upgrade, tipped to dramatically increase the speed. ""Anything that causes fee rates to spike will probably drive people to seek out other solutions,"" Bitcoin Core developer Ava Chow said in an interview with CoinDesk's Daniel Kuhn. Rodarmor, who created the Ordinals protocol for ""Bitcoin NFTs"" last year, shaking up the blockchain's conservative culture, has famously said that the Runes protocol was nothing more than a way of launching ""sh!tcoins"" on Bitcoin – a dicey proposition given how anti-altcoin longtime bitcoiners tend to be. There's now speculation that top Ordinals collections might move to airdrop runes, another practice imported from other blockchains. The Bitcoin NFT project Runestones, led by the pseudonymous developer Leonidas, is reportedly airdropping DOG coins to holders of its inscriptions. In the meantime some of the newly minted runes are drawing jaw-dislodging valuations as they get listed on various crypto exchanges. Bitcoin.com estimated that a rune called ""Z•Z•Z•Z•Z•FEHU•Z•Z•Z•Z•Z,"" or ""Z•FEHU"" for short, already has a fully diluted valuation over $2 billion. (By the way, to type that dot in the middle of the trading ticker, a Runes convention, type option-8 on a Mac keyboard. I had to ask our markets editor how to do it. At this rate, it might be something we all need to learn.)  CELO'S CHOICE. The main developer behind layer-1 blockchain Celo, after a months-long search for a technology provider for its migration to become a layer-2 network atop Ethereum, chose to recommend Optimism's OP Stack. Teams representing rival layer-2 networks Arbitrum, Polygon and zkSync had vied for Celo's business, with the selection process starting to look like TV's ""The Bachelorette.""  COSMOS 🐞– Asymmetric Research, a security firm that contributes to the Wormhole interoperability protocol, disclosed details of a vulnerability impacting the Cosmos blockchain ecosystem that it says could have put more than $150 million at risk.  BIPSTERS: Bitcoin Core developer Ava Chow led the nomination process to name five new editors for BIPs, or Bitcoin Improvement Proposals – the standard for proposing nonbinding software updates that will somehow change the Bitcoin protocol, our Daniel Kuhn reported. The months-long search effort was finalized on Monday, after Jonatack made modifications to the BIP GitHub. A lingering question is whether the addition of editors will make it easier to push through proposals like the pending OP_CAT, which has not been given a BIP number through the formal process, despite reports that originally suggested otherwise.  ALSO:  ""If somebody is spending $16,000 for a toilet seat, everybody’s gonna know about it,"" the independent U.S. presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said, after making a campaign promise to ""put the entire U.S. budget on blockchain."" (The Hill)  Block, the Bitcoin-friendly payments company founded by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, said in a blog post that it completed the development of its 3-nanometer mining chip and is ""in the process of completing a full tapeout of the design with a leading global semiconductor foundry."" The goal is to ""deliver the performance required for mining operators of all types to survive and thrive"" following last week's quadrennial block-rewards halving.  Cryptocurrency casino ZKasino went live over the weekend, but the launch was met with dismay from investors, who are calling foul on the company for converting bridged ETH deposits from about 10,000 users into the project's native ZKAS token, and then sending about $33 million worth of ETH to the staking platform Lido.

One is that the biggest Bitcoin investors tend to be HODLers, and they see no reason to part with their BTC in order to put money into a startup. Another is that many crypto VC firms, in return for their dollars, expect an allocation of digital tokens that would eventually zoom in price, and that's not really an option in for Bitcoin startups, since the community in general is (or was, until recently) averse to anything non-BTC. A final reason is that the Bitcoin developer culture (again, until recently) was so conservative that it didn't really attract the sort of experimentation and entrepreneurship witnessed on other chains.  But there's now a growing cottage industry of venture capitalists and investment firms willing to put money into Bitcoin-focused startups, such as Trammell Venture Partners (TVP) and Ten31. In February, Dan Held, a former Kraken marketing executive who recently served as fractional CMO for Taproot Wizards and Trust Machines, announced he was joining Joe McCann's crypto fund, Asymmetric Financial, as a general partner, with plans to spearhead a new Bitcoin DeFi Venture Fund I, targeting a raise of $21 million.  TVP earlier this month released a research brief titled, ""The Emerging Bitcoin-Native Venture Capital Landscape,"" to illustrate the opportunity. The chart below shows that BTC represents more than half of the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies, but comprises just a small fraction of the venture dollars and deal count:  (Trammell Venture Partners)  Calendar  May 9-10: Bitcoin Asia, Hong Kong.

Wealth management saw a pullback, with only 14% of firms with crypto asset services, offering financial advice for crypto to their clients at year-end 2023, down from 42% the last time the survey was conducted two years prior.  Institutional investors located in Canada significantly increased their holdings of cryptocurrencies in 2023, a survey by KPMG found.  The consulting group recently conducted its bi-annual Institutional Adoption of Cryptoassets survey, finding that Canada’s investment sector has re-embraced crypto after a tumultuous year for the industry in 2022. Respondents include hedge funds, family offices, pension funds, private equity and venture capital firms, among others.  “Rising U.S. debt combined with increasing inflation likely provided a catalyst for the crypto rally of 2023, and it appears investors are looking for alternative asset classes that act as a debasement hedge and a reliable store of value,” said Kunal Bhasin, partner and co-leader of KPMG in Canada’s Digital Assets practice. “Our survey findings suggest crypto assets are increasingly seen as an investable alternative asset class among such institutional investors and financial services organizations in Canada.”  The most notable increase could be seen in institutional investor holdings of cryptocurrencies, which jumped to 39% in 2023 from 29% two years earlier.  Roughly two-thirds of those with exposure had were involved in the crypto-related public equity space, up from 36% in 2021.  There also seemed to have been increased interest in crypto derivatives products, which 42% of those firms reported being exposed to versus just 14% previously.  An area that saw a significant pullback was wealth management, with only 14% of firms with crypto asset services offering financial advice for crypto to their clients, down from 42% in 2021.  Many crypto companies moved a big chunk of their business to Canada last year as U.S. regulators cracked down heavily on the industry. Crypto exchange Coinbase, for example, expanded its footprint to the Canadian West Coast, praising the country’s “regulation by engagement” rather than enforcement approach.  “Canada has played a leading role in creating a regulatory environment that supports innovation in crypto assets,” said Kareem Sadek, emerging technology risk leader and co-leader of KPMG’s Digital Assets practice. “Those actions, along with rising prices for crypto assets are likely reasons why institutional investors have been increasingly attracted to the crypto space.”  CORRECTION (April 24, 2024, 19:01 UTC): An earlier version stated that 75% of the respondent held cryptocurrencies, which was incorrect.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/04/24/kpmg-survey-finds-75-of-canadas-institutions-owned-crypto-assets-in-2023,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/826273778181d94b18b99fb69860d43c3c61863a-5477x3081.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Here’s what could be behind this shift. Bitcoin Newbie Whale Holdings Have Been Rapidly Growing Recently In a new post on X, CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju has discussed about how the holdings of the new whales compares against the old ones in the market right now. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Top Already Here? This Historical Pattern Says So The on-chain indicator of interest here is the “Realized Cap,” which, in short, keeps track of the total amount of capital that the investors have used to purchase their Bitcoin. This capitalization model is in contrast to the usual market cap, which simply measures the total value that the holders as a whole are carrying based on the current spot price. In the context of the current topic, the Realized Cap of the entire market isn’t of interest, but rather specifically that of two segments: the short-term holder whales and long-term holder whales. Whales are defined as entities on the network who are holding at least 1,000 BTC in their balance. At the current exchange rate, this amount is worth $66.6 million, so the whales are clearly quite massive holders. Because of these large holdings, these investors can hold some influence in the market. Based on holding time, the whales can be subdivided into two categories. The short-term holder (STH) whales are those who acquired their coins within the past 155 days, while the long-term holder (LTH) whales have been holding since longer than this timespan. Now, here is the chart shared by Ju that reveals the Realized Cap breakdown between these two Bitcoin whale cohorts: Looks like the metric has shot up for the STH whales recently | Source: @ki_young_ju on X As is visible in the above graph, the Realized Cap of the STH whales has historically not been too different from that of the LTH whales, but that appears to have changed recently. The metric has pulled away for these new whales this year with some very sharp growth, as its value has now reached the $110.6 billion mark. This means that the STH whales have collectively bought their coins at an initial investment of a whopping $110.6 billion. The Realized Cap of the LTH whales, on the other hand, has continued its usual trajectory, floating around $66.9 billion currently. This means that there is now a massive gap between the indicator for these two cohorts. But what’s the reason behind the sudden emergence of this brand-new trend? As mentioned before, the STH cutoff stands at 155 days, which means that the Realized Cap of the STH whales would signify the total value of the purchases made by the whales over the last five months. In the past five months, there has been one event in particular that has stood out, which has also never been present in any of the prior cycles: the approval of the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The spot ETFs provide an alternative mode of investment into the asset through a means that’s familiar to traditional investors. These funds have been bringing in some unprecedented demand into BTC and as their holdings also fall under the 155 days mark, they would count as STH whales.

42418345,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTgi5t,1713977846,"Your Crypto Project Needs a Sheriff, Not a Bounty Hunter","On April 18, Avi Eisenberg was convicted of fraud for his October 2022 exploit of Mango Markets. The case has grabbed particular attention because Eisenberg quickly acknowledged executing the $110 million attack, and characterized his tactics not as a crime, but as a “highly profitable trading strategy,” leaning on his interpretation of the dictum that “code is law.”  Steven Walbroehl is the co-founder and chief technology officer of Halborn, a cybersecurity firm specializing in blockchain companies.  Eisenberg also tried to justify his activities in a second way: by framing the proceeds as a “bug bounty,” or a reward for identifying a vulnerability. That’s how the parties characterized a deal in which Eisenberg returned about $67 million to Mango, but kept the remaining $47 million, in exchange for a promise not to press charges. That would have made it the largest bug bounty in history.  I’ve been a cybersecurity professional for 15 years, and I’ve done some bug-bounty hunting myself. So believe me when I say: that’s not how bug bounties work.  Mango leadership later disavowed the agreement with Eisenberg, understandably saying the deal was made under duress. The courts didn’t take the “bounty” framing seriously, either. That’s good, because the idea that a thief can just return some of his loot and suddenly be a hero creates dangerous incentives.  But the incident also illustrates why even proper bug bounties are controversial among cybersecurity experts. While they have their place in a comprehensive security approach, they can merely create an illusion of safety if used in isolation. Worse, they can create perverse motives and bad blood that increase risk instead of mitigating it– especially for crypto and blockchain projects.  ‘Retroactive bug bounties' or plain old ‘blackmail’?  Many other crypto attackers have returned funds after taking them, for instance in the Poly Network and Euler Finance attacks. It’s a uniquely crypto phenomenon that some have called “retroactive bug bounties.” In vague principle, the idea is that the attackers have found a vulnerability in a system, and that the money they take is somehow a just reward for their discovery. In practice, though, these incidents are more like hostage negotiations, with the victims hoping to cajole or pressure the attacker to give the money back.  I don’t approve of hackers taking financial hostages, but as a former bug-bounty hunter myself, I can’t deny a certain poetic justice to it. More than once, I’ve alerted firms with bounty programs of serious or critical vulnerabilities, only to have them dismiss or ignore the risks for months, or even years. I can fully understand the frustration that might lead a young or naive security researcher in that situation to simply enrich themselves with their knowledge – to pull a Breaking Bad and go from “white hat” sheriff to “black hat” bank robber.  See also: DeFi Needs Hackers to Become Unhackable | Opinion (2021)  A core problem is that projects offering bounties have many incentives to pay them out as infrequently and as cheaply as possible. Obviously there are the financial costs, but you’d be surprised how often a team will deny the severity of a reported bug simply to protect their own reputations, while leaving users at continued risk. That denial can take numerous forms, such as declaring bugs “out of scope” for a posted bounty. Sometimes thin-skinned developers will even threaten legal action against researchers who have properly approached them with serious bugs.  It can be incredibly frustrating for a researcher to put in endless hours in pursuit of a “bug bounty,” only to have their findings dismissed, or even turned back against them. Doing something destructive, such as stealing a lot of money, might even seem like a reasonable way of getting results when you’ve been ignored. That’s the twisted logic behind Avi Eisenberg trying to position his theft as a “bug bounty” – losing $47 million is a pretty big nudge to fix a vulnerability.  Too often, I see blockchain projects relying largely or even exclusively on a mix of bounty programs and in-house oversight for security. And that’s a recipe for disaster.  The frustration of some bounty hunters is inextricable from another shortcoming of bug bounties: They generally do invite a lot of submissions that aren’t useful. For every genuine bug reported, a project could get dozens or even hundreds of reports that lead nowhere. A team could honestly overlook high-quality submissions while sifting through all that dross. More generally, searching for a needle in the bug-bounty haystack can take up so much of staffers’ time and energy that it offsets the cost savings a bounty program might seem to offer.  Bug bounties are also uniquely risky for blockchain projects in a few ways. Unlike, say, an iPhone app, it’s hard to fully test a blockchain-based tool before it has actually been deployed. Mainstream software projects often let bug-hunters try to break pre-production versions of software, but in crypto, vulnerabilities can emerge from a system’s interactions with other on-chain products.  Eisenberg’s Mango hack, for instance, relied on price oracles, and would have been hard or impossible to simulate in a test environment. This can leave bounty hunters trying out attacks on the same systems where real users have money at stake – and putting that real money at risk.  I also worry about the fact that so many blockchain bounty programs allow for anonymous submissions, which are much rarer in mainstream cybersecurity. Some even distribute rewards without identity checks; that is, they have no idea who they’re paying the bounty to.  See also: Calling a Hack an Exploit Minimizes Human Error | Opinion (2022)  This presents a really ominous temptation: a project’s coders might leave bugs in place, or even introduce critical bugs, then let an anonymized friend “find” and “report” the bugs. The insider and the bug hunter could then split the bounty reward, costing the project big bucks without making anyone safer.  You need a sheriff, not a bounty hunter  Despite all of this, bug bounties still have a role to play in blockchain security. The basic idea of offering a reward to attract a huge diversity of talent to try and break your system is still solid. But too often, I see blockchain projects relying largely or even exclusively on a mix of bounty programs and in-house oversight for security. And that’s a recipe for disaster.  There’s a reason, after all, that bounty hunters in movies are so often morally ambiguous “gray hats” – think of Boba Fett, Clint Eastwood’s ""Man With No Name,"" or Dr. King Schulz from ""Django Unchained."" They’re mercenaries, there for a one-off payout, and notoriously indifferent to the bigger picture of the problem they’re solving. At the very far end of the spectrum, you can get an Avi Eisenberg, eager to adopt the cover of a “bug bounty” when they themselves are the actual villains.  That’s why old-time bounty hunters ultimately reported to a sheriff, who has a long-term duty to the people he’s protecting, and makes sure everyone is playing by the rules. In cybersecurity terms, the role of sheriff is played by professional code reviewers – people with public reputations to protect, who get paid regardless of what they uncover. A review by an outside firm also mitigates the misguided defensive impulse of in-house developers who might reject real bugs to protect their own reputation. And blockchain security specialists can often foresee the kinds of financial interactions that gutted Mango Markets, before there’s real money at stake.  The vast majority of bug bounty hunters, to be clear, really are trying to do the right thing. But they have so little power within the rules of that system that it’s little surprise some of them wind up misusing their findings. We can’t normalize that behavior by giving exploiters like Avi Eisenberg the stamp of approval implied by a “bounty” award – and projects that really care about their users’ safety shouldn’t leave it in the hands of the crowd.

The products could start trading on April 30, Bloomberg reported  Management fees of the ETFs are lower than previously thought, one analyst noted  Hong Kong’s market regulator has officially approved the first batch of crypto-related spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), a first for the city and a move that could establish it as Asia’s leading digital-asset hub and unleash further growth in the sector.  The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) gave the nod Tuesday to spot-based bitcoin and ether ETFs by asset managers Harvest Global Investments, China Asset Management (ChinaAMC) and a consortium of Bosera Asset Management and HashKey Capital, according to the regulator's website.  The funds could start trading on April 30, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas said Wednesday, adding that the management fees are lower on average than previously expected.  James Seyffart, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, noted a ""potential fee war"" unfolding between issuers, with Harvest waiving all fees for the first six months. After the initial period, it will charge 0.3% for both its spot BTC and ETH funds, undercutting the Bosera-HashKey funds' 0.6% and ChinaAMC's 0.99% management fees.  The approval comes after U.S. regulators three months ago greenlit the first spot-based bitcoin ETFs in that country, a major breakthrough for the crypto industry that expanded the investor base for the largest and oldest crypto asset and dominated the digital asset market narrative for months. Led by global asset management giant BlackRock's offering, the funds have since amassed over $12 billion in net inflows,, helping propel BTC one month ago to a fresh all-time high price over $73,000.  The Hong Kong-listed spot crypto ETFs are another key step towards making crypto assets more accessible to traditional investors globally, but the impact will likely not replicate the success of the U.S.-based offerings,analysts told CoinDesk earlier.  The issuers whose products were approved in Hong Kong are significant players regionally, but are dwarfed by their U.S. counterparts, some of whom have multiple trillion dollars of assets under management.

We believe the critical next step to onboard the next billion users depends on blockchains’ ability to attract and retain users. To this point: Base, the Ethereum Layer 2 developed by Coinbase, has emerged as a frontrunner with impressive growth this year.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Source: Token Terminal, April 2024  What Factors are Driving Base’s Success?  Leveraging Coinbase for user acquisition: Base is developed by Coinbase to seamlessly bridge their users to the crypto economy. It is integrated into the Coinbase mobile and web applications, with easy fiat on and off ramps from the exchange. With 110 million users at Coinbase and 7 million on Base, there is much room to grow.  User experience: Coinbase is launching major UI improvements addressing the biggest hurdles for mainstream adoption. The Smart wallet simplifies the login process without the need to remember lengthy recovery phrases while Magic Spend uses smart contracts to abstract away the complications of gas payments, allowing dApps to pay gas fees on behalf of their users. Furthermore, Coinbase is going to store more customer USDC balances on Base, making it easy to deploy cash on-chain.  Strong community: Jesse Pollack, the creator of Base is also the biggest influencer within the Base community. We have also seen early success in social dApps building on Base such as Friend.Tech and Farcaster, demonstrating the benefits of Web3 social and building a loyal community.  Although Base does not have its own token, it uses ETH for gas, OP for governance, and AEVO, the token of the largest DEX on Base, functions as the Base ecosystem's incentive token through its vote escrow mechanism. The Base ecosystem fund is acquiring AERO to give out as incentives to projects so they can lock up AERO to incentivize liquidity.  While several established DeFi projects have deployed on Base, the native projects on Base have garnered a significant market share. Aerodrome, the largest DEX on Base by TVL, has generated almost the same amount of fees as Uniswap recently, a notable achievement considering Uniswap is deployed on 16 chains.  Source: Token Terminal, April 2024  Moonwell, the leading borrowing and lending protocol on Base, boasts a TVL that nearly matches those of AAVE and Compound on Base combined and has seen 4X user growth since the beginning of the year. Through the USDC Anywhere program, Moonwell can tap into USDC stored on any chains supported by Circle, in addition to the USDC stored on Coinbase.  Source: Gauntlet, April 2024  Degen, initially a meme token but now utilized by Farcaster as the de facto in-app currency, has experienced a five-times increase in users within a month, exceeding the growth record set by BONK, the famous Solana meme coin.

26316549,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=604928,1713974448,Brace For Impact: Worldcoin Team Plans To Sell 1.5 Million WLD Tokens Every Week For 6 Months,"Worldcoin (WLD) could be the victim of a significant downtrend in the coming weeks. The team plans to sell as many as 1.5 million WLD tokens over the next six months, which could bring about massive selling pressure and affect the token’s price. Details About The Proposed WLD Token Sale Worldcoin revealed in a blog post that World Assets (a subsidiary of the Worldcoin Foundation) will sell between 500,000 and 1.5 million Worldcoin tokens weekly to a group of institutional trading firms outside the United States. This token sale will be done through private placements and is expected to last up to six months. Related Reading: XRP Wallets Holding At Least 1 Million Coins Nears All-Time High As Sentiment Improves Therefore, as many as 36 million WLD tokens could be sold under this arrangement. Interestingly, these tokens do not form part of the current circulating supply, as Worldcoin stated that “the circulating supply of WLD will thus increase correspondingly” as the token sales progress. That means Worldcoin’s circulating supply could see an 18.6% increase to over 229 million WLD tokens once the private sale is done. This development is undoubtedly a cause for concern for WLD holders, given the impact it could have on the crypto token’s price action. However, Worldcoin tried to downplay the effect of this token sale, noting that a weekly sale of between 500,000 and 1.5 million WLD tokens represents “less than 0.1% to 0.4% of the current weekly trading volume. Meanwhile, World Assets “may seek to include a 40-day lock-up period restricting the resale of WLD by trading firms,” Worldcoin remarked. This could also help reduce the high volatility that could arise from an immediate sell-off by these trading firms. The Worldcoin Ecosystem WLD is the native token of Worldcoin, a project that focuses on the digital verification of humans. Users in the Worldcoin ecosystem get verified through a device called the “Orb.” Since launching last year, the project, co-founded by Open AI’s CEO Sam Altman, has drawn criticism, with many, including Ethereum’s co-founder Vitalik Buterin, raising privacy and legal concerns. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Price Will Reach $100, But This Needs To Happen First Authorities in different countries have investigated the project as they believe its data collection method may have breached certain privacy laws. NewsBTC also recently reported that Worldcoin faces a potential fine of $1.2 million in Argentina for violating the country’s National Consumer Protection Law. Despite the regulatory scrutiny, the team is still looking to expand. In the blog post, they hinted that the proceeds from this token sale will be directed towards meeting the “increasing demand for orb-verified World IDs around the world.” At the time of writing, Worldcoin is trading at around $5.4, down over 6% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42418369,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTgiHF,1713974400,Why Asset Tokenization Is Inevitable,"Financial markets are undergoing a transformative shift with the advent of tokenization. This movement is not merely a speculative trend among tech enthusiasts, but a fundamental shift in how assets are managed and transacted globally.  The tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) is not just an emerging trend; it is setting the stage for a new era of asset management.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  The distinction between crypto-native tokens and tokenized RWAs is crucial. Crypto-native tokens, such as bitcoin and ether, are purely digital and serve as both a speculative investment, store of value, and a utility within their own ecosystems. Tokenized RWAs, on the other hand, bridge the digital and traditional financial worlds, effectively bringing liquidity and fractionalization to improve the accessibility of assets that were previously “less liquid.”  The March 20 launch of BlackRock's first tokenized fund, BUIDL, a private short-term treasury fund, marked a significant milestone for tokenization. Not only did BUIDL attract almost $300 million in assets in its first month, but BlackRock, the largest asset manager, is signaling that tokenization will be “the next generation for markets.” Tokenized government treasuries are already a $1.2 billion category, with products like BENJI, issued by Franklin Templeton, BlackRock’s BUIDL, and Ondo Finance’s USDY which highlights a meteoric 10x growth since January of last year.  Currently, on-chain RWAs represent a $7.5 billion market. While this might seem marginal relative to the tens of trillions of dollars worth of assets managed traditionally, the pace of growth and the increasing range of assets being tokenized — including treasuries, commodities, private equity, real estate, private credit, and others — suggest a tipping point. A 2022 Boston Consulting Group report estimated that the market for tokenized assets could grow to $16 trillion by 2030, which would greatly enable DeFi protocols catering to these assets to develop entire new financial ecosystems across lending, liquidity pools, futures and derivatives, and other markets.  Trillions of dollars of new wealth has been created on-chain. This is a new investor demographic that expects to access and interact with financial products and services from their own wallets. These crypto-native investors have benefited from an ecosystem that operates 24/7, with lower barriers to entry than traditional financial gatekeepers, walled gardens, and business hours, and sometimes even front-running traditional markets.  A recent example that, X user @kaledora analyzed on April 13, 2024, as geopolitical tensions rose between Iran and Israel, PAXG, a version of tokenized gold, traded at a 20% premium to its closing price of April 12, with its volume peaking at end of day on Sunday, April 14. This coincided with gold’s market open at 5pm ET and illustrates that the fundamental principles of asset safety, which are central to traditional markets, also apply to digital assets.  Graph Source: @kaledora on X  The concept of ""Bring Your Own Wallet"" (BYOW) encapsulates the autonomy and power shift that blockchain brings to individual investors. BYOW removes the dependency on intermediaries for asset custody, allowing investors to manage and access their assets without the constraints of traditional intermediaries and delayed settlement.  As more assets come on-chain, asset managers will likely incorporate strategies that will allow them to tap into new sources of liquidity, and arbitrage between on-chain and off-chain markets. This evolution brings familiar territories on-chain, providing asset managers with the traditional framework they are accustomed to, allowing them to apply fundamental portfolio construction principles and manage investment strategies within a digital asset context that will provide distribution opportunities into crypto-native investors.  As we look forward, the tokenization of asset classes and the integration of crypto-native investment principles will likely become a standard in the modern asset management lifecycle. The shift is not just inevitable; it is clearly underway. Asset managers and allocators who embrace this change will build new generational firms that align with a new generation of investors.

Tether could see its dominance wane if the stablecoin bill is approved, the report said.  New digital asset custody providers could emerge leading to greater competition.  Regulatory clarity in the U.S. should inspire banks from the traditional financial world to enter the stablecoin market and may also reduce the dominance of Tether's USDT, S&P Global Ratings said in a report on Wednesday.  A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that serves as bedrock in crypto markets. U.S. Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) introduced a new stablecoin bill last week that seeks to define how stablecoins will operate in the country.  The U.S. dollar is the most popular peg for stablecoins, but most stablecoin issuers aren't subject to specific U.S. regulations, the report said. This could change following the introduction of the Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act last week.  ""The new rules may offer banks a competitive advantage by limiting institutions without a banking license to a maximum issuance of $10 billion,"" analyst Andrew O'Neill wrote.  Tether's USDT has a market capitalization of $110 billion, making it the third-biggest cryptocurrency, according to CoinDesk data. Circle's USDC is in second place among stablecoins at $34 billion. Both track the U.S. dollar.  ""An approval of the stablecoin bill would accelerate institutional blockchain innovation, in particular for tokenization or digital bond issuances involving on-chain payments,"" O'Neill said, adding that the ""growth of institutional use cases for stablecoins would create opportunities for banks as stablecoin issuers and may also reduce tether's dominance in the global stablecoin market.""  S&P said that USDT is issued by a non-U.S. entity and therefore is not a permitted payment stablecoin under the proposed bill. This means that U.S. entities can't hold or transact in it, which could reduce USDT's demand while at the same time giving a boost to U.S.-issued stablecoins. Still, USDT transaction activity is located mainly outside the U.S. in emerging markets and is driven by retail investors and remittances, the report noted.  ""New providers of digital asset custody services could emerge with the removal of the SEC's requirement that custodians report digital assets on their balance sheet,"" the report added, and this could lead to greater competition.  S&P previously critiqued USDT for being worse than rivals at doing its core task: being valued at $1.

26313643,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=604902,1713969047,"Analysts Identify Key Scenario For Bitcoin Hitting $100,000","Prior to the Bitcoin Halving event, BTC’s price saw considerable instability, but it has since rebounded, reaching the $66,000 level, triggering bullish predictions from top crypto analysts regarding the coin’s future path. Captain Faibik, a crytocurrency analyst and trader, has emerged with an intriguing prediction, underscoring a narrative that could potentially propel the price of Bitcoin to the coveted $100,000 mark in the upcoming months. Bitcoin Poised For A Notable Rally To $100,000 According to Captain Faibik, Bitcoin has managed to hold the $60,000 support level in the wake of bullish investors in the market. As a result, the largest crypto asset by market cap is currently making a strong comeback. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bloodbath Over? Analysts Say $60,000 Is The Cycle’s Bottom These bullish investors, according to Faibik must reclaim the crucial $72,000 resistance level in order to see a major rally to the $100,000 price level. This scenario acts as a ray of hope for the cryptocurrency community, igniting speculations and influencing projections about Bitcoin’s potential for future growth. Given the anticipated impact of the Bitcoin Halving and bulls, the $72,000 level could be realized in the short term. The expert previously highlighted that the Bitcoin weekly candle closed above the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) 10, demonstrating that the bulls are still very much in charge of the market. Following the Descending Channel break out in October last year, BTC Bulls has firmly secured the weekly EMA10, prompting the crypto analyst to put his next price target for the digital asset at $100,000. Faibik also noted that the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) for Bitcoin has emerged from a falling wedge pattern. This breakout suggests that a 15% to 20% bullish rally in Bitcoin’s value is on the horizon. Meanwhile, in the daily timeframe, a bullish flag formation is underway, and in the event of an upward breakout from the bullish flag, Faibik anticipates a new all-time high for Bitcoin by May. Is A $1.5 million Price Level Possible For BTC? One of the most bullish predictions for Bitcoin this year came from Ark Invest Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Cathie Wood. The CEO foresees the digital asset to rise by over 2,000% reaching a whopping $1.5 million by 2030. Related Reading: ARK Invest Pivots To Bitcoin As Cathie Wood Expects BTC Price To Explode During an interview in Hong Kong, Wood reiterated her projections for BTC, which were supported by a thorough investigation that included institution surveys and evaluations of market volatility. She stated: I have been asked this question from different angles, and our analysis from multiple perspectives indicates that by 2030, Bitcoin could rise to $1.5 million. This price prediction is based on a survey of institutions, using a discount rate and volatility analysis. Initially, Wood’s forecast for Bitcoin was estimated at $600,000 in the next six years. However, considering the effect of the Bitcoin Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), she now believes the coin has the potential to hit $1.5 million.

Block said that it will develop a full bitcoin mining system based on its chip design.  Block, the payments company founded by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, is building its own bitcoin {{BTC}} mining system as it deepens its footing in the challenging crypto mining space, the firm said on Tuesday.  The firm, formerly known as Square, said in a blog post that it completed the development of its three-nanometer mining chip, which it had been working on since April 2023. The full design is in process with a leading global semiconductor foundry, according to the post.  In addition to that, Block said that after speaking to community members about the pain points in the industry, it decided to also develop a full bitcoin mining system, which will include system design.  “We’ve spent a significant amount of time talking to a wide variety of bitcoin miners to identify the challenges faced by mining operators,” it said in the post. “Building on these insights and pursuant to our goal of supporting mining decentralization, we plan to offer both a standalone mining chip as well as a full mining system of our own design.  The bitcoin mining industry is dominated by only a few players, with Beijing-based miner Bitmain controlling roughly 60% of the market, according to estimates by CoinShares.  “There are few serious competitors, which indicates significant potential for disruption,” said James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares.  Block announced the completion of a five-nanometer bitcoin mining chip prototype in May 2023, which is the same technology that Bitmain’s S21 mining machine uses. “This leads us to believe that 3nm chips could achieve even greater efficiencies,” he said.  Although chip efficiency has rapidly improved in recent years as demand for bitcoin has picked up, the latest halving event on April 20, which cut the issuance of new bitcoin by 50%, adds even more importance for faster mining speed, as well as lower costs and enhances reliability, Butterfill said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/04/24/jack-dorseys-block-is-building-a-bitcoin-mining-system,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c65b8ead0d19d4bb9349b2fa37927790ab65439b-1435x807.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42418342,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTgi4r,1713967200,Some Square Users Can Now Convert Their Dollars to Bitcoin Via Cash App,"Jack Dorsey’s fintech company Block (SQ), formerly known as Square, is linking together two of its biggest platforms, merchant services system Square and peer-to-peer payments app Cash App, to give retail stores the ability to automatically convert a portion of their daily sales into bitcoin {{BTC}}, according to an announcement on Wednesday.  The tool, called Bitcoin Conversions, will set eligible Square users up with a dedicated Cash App account programmed to receive 1% to 10% of their store’s revenues, which will then be converted on their behalf into BTC, which can then be held, sold or transferred “as they see fit.” The service will be limited to sole proprietors or single member LLCs until a full rollout to Square customers in the coming months.  Block reportedly carried out market research by surveying Square sellers and found that there is demand for a product like Bitcoin Conversions. Many merchants “are interested in bitcoin and believe it presents a wide range of use cases, such as long term savings and diversifying their businesses’ holdings,” the company’s press release says.  “Many sellers have told us they want an easy way to access bitcoin and diversify their holdings, so we tapped into Block's ecosystem to deliver a solution for them. Bitcoin Conversions automates the process for sellers while still giving them flexibility and control over how they manage their bitcoin,"" Bitcoin Product Lead at Cash App Michael Rihani told CoinDesk in an email.  It also presents a potentially lucrative financial service for Block, depending on how many merchants sign up and how much capital is converted per day. At launch, the new service will charge a flat 1% conversion fee – lower than the 2.25% fee Cash App charges for most retail purchases of bitcoin – but still an extra 1% Block can earn on top of existing processing fees.  Cash App, one of the most popular ways to onboard users into the bitcoin economy, appears to be emerging as the hub of Block’s Bitcoin-focused efforts. Last month, the company began shipping out pre-orders of its proprietary, non-custodial Bitkey bitcoin wallet, which is connected to Cash App to provide “seamless” BTC purchases and transfers.  Block earned a total profit of $1.18 billion on its Cash App business last year, up 25% year over year, including non-bitcoin sales, while Square generated a gross profit of $828 million. The company held approximately 8,038 BTC (worth $531 million at today's prices) as of the end of December.  See also: Jack Dorsey's Block Inc.

The sell-off was likely catalyzed by users looking to reclaim their ETH in low liquidity conditions and large liquidations of ezETH-collateralized positions.  Renzo restaked ETH (ezETH), the liquid restaking token representing a user's restaked position at Renzo, experienced a brief crash early Wednesday, trading at a massive discount to wrapped ether (WETH) in a low liquidity environment.  Data from DEXscreener show that ezETH fell as low as $750 on Ethereum-based decentralized exchange Uniswap at around 02:45 UTC. The token deviated from its 1:1 peg with WETH, falling to a low of 0.27.  Renzo, the second-largest liquid restaking protocol, uses the Ethereum restaking protocol Eigenlayer to allow users to restake their ether {{ETH}} in return for Renzo's ezETH, which users can deploy across other decentralized finance applications to generate an extra yield.  On Tuesday, Renzo released the economic model and airdrop of its native token REZ, which users can receive on May 2. The first season of rewards is scheduled to end on April 26, following which the second season will begin. Users who sell ezETH before April 26 may not receive the airdrop.  According to observers, the sell-off was likely catalyzed by users looking to reclaim their ETH and deploy it in other liquid restaking platforms.  ""People sold ezETH on Uniswap, and they had lower liquidity, so the slippage caused the price to drop to below $700, which caused massive liquidation on [generalized leverage protocol] Gearbox and [lending protocol] Morpho,"" Hitesh Malviya, founder of crypto analytics platform DYOR, told CoinDesk.  The initial price slide was likely aggravated by the liquidation of loopers or traders who repeatedly ezETH as collateral to borrow ETH to create leverage, according to pseudonymous observer Tommy.  Investor disappointment with the token supply chart was another reason for the price drop, DYOR said.  ""Another issue was mainly a goof-up on the token supply chart, which indicated a 65% supply allocation to the team and investors. They later changed and deleted that tweet, which caused a massive hate spree among the community,"" Malviya told CoinDesk.  The crash was short-lived, and prices quickly recovered to above $3,000.

In exchange for staking, validators earn rewards. However, as Solana’s price began its recent ascent, a noticeable decline in staked SOL was observed. This suggests that some validators are choosing to unstake their coins, potentially to capitalize on the price surge and book some early profits. Solana Market Cap And Price Soar Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Solana enjoyed a stellar day, surging 17% and adding over $11 billion to its market capitalization, which now stands at over $70 billion. This impressive performance saw Solana outperform industry giants like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), which remained entangled in their own price gyrations. With its market capitalization now totaling an impressive $80.7 billion, Solana’s surge has caught the attention of the crypto world. Related Reading: Solana Meme Coin Massacre: 12 Projects Gone In 30 Days, $27 Million Vanished This unstaking activity has drawn the attention of analysts, with the unstaked amount reaching a significant 5 million SOL over the past week. With Solana currently trading around $157 per coin, this translates to roughly $780 million worth of tokens re-entering the market. The influx of such a large volume in a short period could lead to a temporary oversupply situation on exchanges. SOL price action in the last 24 hours. Source: Coingecko Pullback Or Power Through? The potential impact of unstaked SOL on the price is a matter of debate. Without a corresponding surge in demand to absorb this additional supply, there’s a risk of an initial price correction in the coming days. This could see Solana retreat from its current perch and settle around the $150 mark before potentially resuming its upward trajectory towards $200. Total crypto market cap currently at $2.3 trillion. Chart: TradingView The $200 Target The coming days will be crucial for Solana. The bulls need to maintain strong buying pressure to absorb the unstaked coins and push the price above the $160 resistance zone. If successful, this could propel Solana towards its $200 target. However, a failure to do so, coupled with a large-scale sell-off from unstaked SOL, could trigger a correction down to $150.

The firm has been on an expansion streak recently, launching in several countries globally, most recently in the African region.  Strike, the payments application using the Bitcoin blockchain, has launched in Europe, allowing customers to buy, sell and withdraw bitcoin {{BTC}} in the region, it announced Wednesday.  The company recently expanded its services to Africa and is already rolled out in Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America.  Customers can check their local iOS or Android app store to see if the app is available in their country as some are excluded from the expansion.  “As the third-largest economy globally … Europe presents vast opportunities for bitcoin adoption,” Strike said in a press release. “We’ve seen the demand and heard the feedback first-hand from the community.”  Strike, a product of Chicago-based Zap Solutions that is led by entrepreneur Jack Mallers, launched in the U.S. in 2020. The app can be compared to Cash App or PayPal, two popular online payment systems, in that it lets customers send and receive money around the world. The difference is that Strike uses the Bitcoin blockchain to do so, making transfers faster and cheaper than other alternatives.  European customers will be able to buy, sell and withdraw BTC directly with euro deposits through SEPA, the region’s payments provider.

42418348,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTgi6v,1713963600,Crypto Custody Firm Fireblocks Now Offers DeFi Threat Detection for Institutions,"Fireblocks has released dApp Protection and Transaction Simulation products to help institutional DeFi users avoid suspicious smart contracts, phishing websites, and compromised dApps.  The products check decentralized applications across 40+ blockchains via WalletConnect, Fireblocks’ browser extension, and MetaMask Institutional.  Cryptocurrency custody specialist Fireblocks is helping institutions exploring decentralized finance (DeFi) from interacting with bad actors and falling victim to malicious attacks with new threat detection and smart contract evaluation tools.  Fireblocks’ dApp Protection and Transaction Simulation products, which have been in beta testing since December of last year with Galaxy and Flowdesk, are now available to check decentralized applications across over 40 blockchains via WalletConnect, Fireblocks’ browser extension, and MetaMask Institutional.  There has been a recent surge of interest in DeFi – sometimes described as a playground for hackers – thanks to a steady increase in crypto asset prices. Institutions are increasingly exploring swapping, lending, staking and bridging using popular platforms like Uniswap, Aave, Curve, 1inch and Jupiter.  Some Fireblocks customers have their own dedicated Web3 research team, but most people need to scale their operations and don’t necessarily have the resources to hire cybersecurity experts who also understand DeFi and Web3, said Shahar Madar, VP of security products at Fireblocks.  The solution looks for suspicious smart contracts, phishing websites, and compromised dApps by identifying malicious patterns such as imitative URLs, harmful javascript elements, and suspicious registrars.  “We’ve mapped out the user journey of a DeFi and Web3 trader,” Madar said in an interview. “Usually, it starts when you scan with your phone and connect to a dApp and are asked to start signing transactions. We put mitigations and detection mechanisms throughout this journey. For instance, we scan the transaction, we scan the counterparty, we try to make sense of the contract, and also offer transaction simulation, essentially giving you the bottom line of what you should be expecting.”",POSITIVE,없음,MARKET | UNI | RESEARCH,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/04/24/crypto-custody-firm-fireblocks-offers-defi-threat-detection-for-institutions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9ea49eaecbb6a8b56192e2ea3d4d6c55de121181-3511x1975.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42418366,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTgiD7,1713962327,How a Conservative German Bank Offering Crypto Makes Sense,"When thinking about global financial innovation (which I’m sure you all do often, right?), Germany is not usually the first jurisdiction to come to mind.  As well as a struggling manufacturing sector and messy politics, Europe’s largest economy is known for its conservative and rigid financial sector dominated by banks rather than by markets.  It is, therefore, somewhat of a surprise to see its banks lead Europe in the exploration of an entirely new type of market.  Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading, and host of the CoinDesk Markets Daily podcast. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.  Last week, Germany’s Landesbank Baden-Württemberg (LBBW) announced that it was launching crypto procurement and custody services later this year.  Read more: Germany's Largest Federal Bank LBBW to Offer Crypto Custody Services With Bitpanda  LBBW is Germany’s largest landesbank, which is a type of savings institution usually owned at least partially by the state. As the name implies, savings institutions are among the most conservative institutions in an already conservative field, as their focus is stability, more so even than profit.  The current institution emerged in 1999 as the result of a merger, but the family tree goes back as far as 1818. Despite being owned by the Federal State of Baden-Württemberg, the Savings Bank Association of Baden-Württemberg, and the City of Stuttgart, LBBW has typically been more aggressive than many of its peers. It is one of the largest participants in Germany’s bond market, one of the largest real estate lenders in Germany, and yet can still boast high debt ratings.  And now, it will offer corporate clients access to assets that executives from much more aggressive banks in more supposedly forward-looking jurisdictions call “garbage” and other less-kind descriptions.  What is even more surprising is the language used in the announcement. A statement from Jürgen Harengel, COO of the Corporate Bank at LBBW, said:  ""The demand from our corporate customers for digital assets is increasing. We are convinced that crypto assets will establish themselves as a building block for further business models.”  You may well be asking yourself, “what kind of demand from corporate customers?”, and “what kind of business models?” We’ll get to that in a second, but first, let’s step back and take a look across the ocean.  Contrast this to the institutional vibe in the U.S., which is all about retail demand (and institutional interest, which in turn usually depends on retail or high-net-worth individuals). In other words, the U.S. focus seems to be on store-of-value hedging and speculative trading.  In Germany, the goal seems to be more about business.  Unlike the U.S., Germany’s financial industry is dominated by banks rather than by markets, with ultra-conservative state-owned savings banks playing a very large role. Debt dominates corporate financing much more than bonds or equities, which means that German banks are more deeply embedded in corporate activity than are their U.S. counterparts.  This brings us to LBBW’s probable motivation here. Thinking longer-term, the bank is not as interested in crypto trading as it is in token utility, and what that can do for its corporate clients.  Back in 2019, LBBW was one of the early participants in the Marco Polo distributed ledger trade finance solution, which dissolved last year. In 2022, LBBW was one of the first to issue digital securities on Deutsche Börse’s D7 post-trade platform. Last year, the bank invested in the tokenization network SWIAT, developed by DekaBank (itself an interesting story, for another time). This year, LBBW will be one of the first participants in the ECB’s wholesale DLT trial.  You can see the pattern? LBBW is actively exploring corporate blockchain applications. It seems to realize that these will need tokens, and my guess is that it wants an active token exchange platform up and running for when token issuance becomes more common among businesses developing enterprise blockchain applications.  It probably does see some demand from corporate clients for BTC, ETH and other liquid crypto assets. But that doesn’t feel like the real goal here. It feels like LBBW is getting ready for a more tokenized business world, in which value is more about function than form, and liquidity matters more than price appreciation.  To see this strategy playing out more in Germany than in the U.S. is fitting, given their different market characteristics. It is also encouraging in that it highlights how crypto markets are not just about portfolio allocations and nice capital gains; crypto markets are also about more efficient distribution, accountability and flexibility.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Noelle Acheson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/04/24/how-a-conservative-german-bank-offering-crypto-makes-sense,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/562839dfb7f0ec03941773965b34723c705fc869-3149x1772.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This has historically been associated with a rising price. The halving reduces the block reward for miners, but our focus remains on sources of potential increased demand across the bitcoin network, especially given all the publicity in the space during 2024. Bitcoin's transparent and immutable monetary policy, along with its alternative investment exposure, could make it an attractive option for investors seeking a potential long-term store of value. By Christopher Gannatti, CFA, & Blake Heimann The bitcoin “halving” (or “halvening,” as some say) is an event that takes place in the bitcoin network roughly every four years. Newly issued (or mined) bitcoin is cut in half, reducing oncoming supply. At a point near the year 2140, the total supply of 21 million bitcoins will be mined, and no more new supply will become available to the market. Economics 101 would say that, holding demand constant, this tightening of supply would lead to higher prices - which is what has been observed in past events such as this. Will this be the case once again? Concepts Underpinning the Halving Approximately every 10 minutes, a new block is added to the bitcoin blockchain, recording transactions on the bitcoin network from across the globe. Someone, or some computer, needs to add these blocks to the blockchain. This is the responsibility of bitcoin miners. As they compile transactions into blocks, validating their accuracy in the process and adding these blocks to the blockchain, there is an incentive for them to do so. This incentive comes in the form of the “block reward,” or a newly minted bitcoin, which serves as payment for their efforts. Every 210,000 blocks, which equates to roughly every four years, this block reward is cut in half. As a result, miners get paid less bitcoin to do the same activities, and the newly minted bitcoin coming into circulation is reduced. Daily revenues paid to miners and the prevailing block reward can be seen in Figure 1, with the halving events reflected by the downward steps in the block reward. Figure 1: Block Rewards and Bitcoin Miner Revenue (BTC) Subsequently, each halving cycle has a fixed amount of bitcoin issuance as a function of the block reward (210,000 blocks x block reward = newly minted bitcoins paid to miners). Halving events repeat until the block reward, and therefore new issuance, becomes negligible. At that point, no new supply comes online, and the prevailing supply is all that will ever be - 21 million bitcoins. This can be verified in the code in two places: in the function defining block rewards and in the function explicitly setting the max. These supply dynamics can be seen in Figure 2. Interestingly, the mining process will be ongoing for roughly 100 calendar years, even though the vast majority of the supply will have already been created by 2040. Figure 2: Bitcoin Mined per Halving Cycle and Circulating Supply, Millions Implications for Investors The broad implications of the halving are threefold: Reduced bitcoin-denominated payment for miners (reduced block reward) Reduced supply coming online, with a max supply of 21 million, which is estimated to be achieved in the year 2140 An alternative, transparent monetary policy providing an opportunity for an alternative investment exposure Put simply, bitcoin monetary policy is very different from the monetary policies employed by global governments, which can print as much money as they desire at any time. The first implication is that holding all else constant, including bitcoin price in USD terms, it can lead to pressure on miners as their input costs come in the form of energy to run the computers doing the work of adding these blocks to the blockchain. If the USD price doesn’t remain above input costs, poorly capitalized bitcoin mining companies may be forced to consolidate, restructure or shut down. Investors with bitcoin mining equity exposure may want to be mindful of this dynamic as we see the price of bitcoin evolve over the coming weeks. The second implication is to reiterate the overall reduction in bitcoin supply coming into circulation. With only so many blocks processed per day, the miner is rewarded with less newly minted bitcoin for each block. With the current iteration of the halving, these block rewards have been reduced from 6.25 to 3.125 bitcoins, marking a point in time where 19.7 million bitcoins (or nearly 94% of supply) are in circulation. Since these rewards are halved regularly, the overall newly minted bitcoin reduces until we eventually reach 0 for a block reward and a maximum circulating supply of 21 million bitcoins. The third serves as a reminder of the transparent and immutable monetary policy implemented through the bitcoin software. There is no question about if and when these reductions in issuance take place, nor is there a group of leaders such as central bank policy makers reacting to the data to determine the best policy actions going forward. The bitcoin network is global, operating 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Use cases of the network may differ depending on where an individual is based and whether that person’s home currency is more stable (think U.S. dollar, Swiss franc, euro, Japanese yen, British pound) or less stable (Turkish lira, Argentinian peso, Nigerian naira). Is It Too Late? Given recent performance, investors reading this may wonder if it is too late to consider bitcoin in weighing the applicable risks. Many institutions are only just beginning to allocate or evaluate such investments, meaning bitcoin’s total market capitalization has reached a point of USD 1.3 trillion 1 . With a significant portion of global capital not yet deployed in this space, it is still early days. We saw this with the introduction of the spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S . Figure 3: Bitcoin Halving Cycle Details Furthermore, halving events have historically been a great time to begin allocating. In previous cycles, significant positive price action has followed halvings, with each returning multiple times the initial investment within approximately one year from the onset. We know the future is uncertain, and we can’t look at history to predict what will happen next, but it is worth noting that a pattern has emerged in alignment with the basic supply and demand narratives from above. To give Figure 4 some additional detail and clarification : First Halving: The date of the Halving event was November 28, 2012. 1M is from the halving date to December 28, 2012, 6M is from the halving date to May 28, 2012 and 1Y is from the halving date to November 28, 2013. The price of 1-bitcoin on the halving date was $12.30, whereas 1M forward it was $13.42, 9.1% higher than on the halving date. 6M forward it was $125.87, which was 923.7% higher than on the halving date. 1Y forward it was $1,012.81, which was 8,136.9% higher than on the halving date. Second Halving: The date of the Halving event was July 9, 2016. 1M is from the halving date to August 9, 2016. 6M is from the halving date to January 9, 2017. 1Y is from the halving date to July 9, 2017. The price of 1-bitcoin on the halving date was $657.32. The price 1M forward was $585.99, which was 10.9% below that of the halving date. The price 6M forward was $901.68, which was 37.2% above that of the halving date. The price 1Y forward was $2,505.72, which was 281.2% above that of the halving date. Third Halving: The date of the Halving event was May 11, 2020. 1M is from the halving date to June 11, 2020. 6M is from the halving date to November 11, 2020. 1Y is from the halving date to May 11, 2021. The price of 1-bitcoin on the halving date was $8,599.78. The price 1M forward was $9,324.48, which was 8.4% above that of the halving date. The price 6M forward was $15,693.91, which was 82.5% above that of the halving date. The price 1Y forward was $56,714.09, which was 559.5% above that of the halving date. Figure 4: Historical Halving Events It will be interesting to see how things play out in the coming weeks. This halving is the first that has seen such widespread media coverage - notably traditional financial news outlets like Bloomberg and CNBC - as well as increased access through widely available ETF offerings, improving ease of access and institutions coming onboard. 1 Sources: Capital.com, ZenLedger, WisdomTree, 2024.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Hedera’s native HBAR token surged by over 107% on Tuesday, then slipped 25%, as investors believed that BlackRock was involved in a fund tokenization project on the Hedera blockchain. On Tuesday, the HBAR Foundation, which tries to spur development of the Hedera ecosystem, announced that BlackRock’s ICS U.S. Treasury money market fund had been tokenized on the Hedera blockchain in collaboration with Archax. Hedera supporters on social media began claiming that BlackRock chose Hedera to tokenize its fund, although this wasn’t the case. Archax CEO Graham Rodford said that “it was indeed an Archax choice to put [the fund] on Hedera,” in response to criticism about potentially misleading marketing from HBAR. The token is currently up 50% over the past 24 hours trading at 13 cents.  Stablecoin issuer Tether has said it will freeze wallets using USDT to evade sanctions on oil exports in Venezuela. The decision comes after Reuters reported that Venezuela's state-run oil company PDVSA increased its use of tether to bypass renewed U.S. sanctions on oil exports. The firm froze 41 wallets tied to the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list in December. “Tether respects the OFAC SDN list and is committed to working to ensure sanction addresses are frozen properly,” a Tether spokesperson told CoinDesk. PDVSA’s use of USDT, which began last year, has accelerated following the U.S.’s decision to reimpose sanctions due to concerns over Venezuela’s upcoming election.  Binance's founder and former chief executive, Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, should spend three years in prison for his role in enabling the crypto exchange to violate federal sanctions and money laundering laws, the U.S. Department of Justice said Tuesday night. The former CEO's attorneys argued he should serve no jail time, citing the fine he paid and his ""extraordinary acceptance of responsibility."" Attorneys with the DOJ filed a sentencing memo arguing he should spend 36 months in prison and pay a $50 million fine after he pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act last November. Hours later, Zhao's defense team filed its own sentencing memo, saying, ""no defendant in a remotely similar BSA case has ever been sentenced to incarceration."" Instead, they suggested he be sentenced to probation, which could include home confinement at his home in Abu Dhabi. ""The sentence in this case will not just send a message to Zhao but also to the world. Zhao reaped vast rewards for his violation of U.S. law, and the price of that violation must be significant to effectively punish Zhao for his criminal acts and to deter others who are tempted to build fortunes and business empires by breaking U.S. law,"" the filing said.

26307725,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=604855,1713958233,Solana Memecoins WIF And BONK Explode By Double Digits: Key Reasons,"Two Solana-based memecoins, Bonk (BONK) and Dogwifhat (WIF), have registered substantial gains over the past 24 hours. BONK recorded a 35% increase, while WIF climbed by 19%, positioning them among the top three gainers in the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap today. Only Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) surpassed them, with a notable 44% rise during the same period. Resolution Of Solana’s Congestion Issues Spurs Memecoins The significant uptick in these Solana memecoins is closely linked to the recent improvements in the Solana network’s performance. A tweet from SolanaFloor earlier today indicated, “BREAKING: Solana’s congestion issues have been completely resolved, with block production back to normal. Transactions confirming in under 2 seconds.” This announcement marks a pivotal moment for the network which had been plagued by congestion issues. Source A: https://t.co/2TVnbaPNlHSource B: https://t.co/GfHxy8dC1B — SolanaFloor | Powered by Step Finance (@SolanaFloor) April 24, 2024 On April 15, Solana developers rolled out crucial updates designed to alleviate these problems, urging validators to adopt version v1.17.31. This version introduces changes in the treatment of validators based on their stakes. Further enhancements are anticipated with the release of version v1.18 next month, which will include a new scheduler, albeit disabled by default. Related Reading: Solana Meme Coin Massacre: 12 Projects Gone In 30 Days, $27 Million Vanished Andrew Kang, founder of Mechanism Capital, remarked a few days before the fix, “Let’s also not forget that the Solana congestion issues have weighed down SOL and Solana-based memecoins significantly. It’s not a question of if but when the network is significantly improved. That’s your springboard.” Kang’s comments now seem prophetic as the resolution of network issues has indeed acted as a springboard for memecoin valuations. Specifics On Rally Of Dogwifhat (WIF) And BONK The price of WIF soared to a 24-hour high of $3.43 on April 24, buoyed by an impressive 96% increase in trading volume. This influx was fueled by notable acquisitions from whales like Ansem, who capitalized on the positive market sentiments. Related Reading: Solana Price Jumps 7% On Bitcoin And Ethereum ETF Approvals, Network Congestion Update The breakout above the resistance level at $3.18, after a week of sideways trading between $1.97 and $3.18, was a significant trigger. WIF formed a two-week-long ascending triangle, a bullish chart pattern that indicated a continuation of the previous upward trend. The breakout was widely discussed in the crypto community, with trader Bluntz Capital confirming the pattern’s resolution and sparking further bullish sentiment. 2 week long ascending triangle forming here on $WIF, i think the breakout is imminent pic.twitter.com/S0OZWBsq6u — Bluntz (@Bluntz_Capital) April 24, 2024 BONK is registering a dramatic 35% rise, with a remarkable 304% increase in trading volume. The price action successfully breached the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.000020727, and continued its upward trajectory to the 0.5 Fibonacci level, signaling strong buying interest and bullish momentum. This rally probably gained additional support from the recent listing of BONK by the global neobank Revolut, which was announced on April 22. This inclusion in Revolut’s trading platform, which features over 150 digital currencies, provided significant exposure and legitimacy, further enhancing investor interest and market activity around BONK.

Zhao is scheduled to be sentenced on April 30 after he and Binance settled charges with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) in November 2023. Despite Zhao waiving the right to appeal any sentence up to 18 months back then, the DOJ has now sought a 36-month sentence.  Read More: Binance Founder Changpeng Zhao Should Spend 3 Years in Prison, DOJ Says  In the letter addressed to the U.S. Judge from the Western District of Washington, Richard A. Jones, Zhao said, ""There is no excuse for my failure to establish the necessary compliance controls at Binance” and gave an assurance that this would be his only “encounter with the criminal justice system.”  Going forward, Zhao said, he wanted to support biotech startups and the youth. Along with Zhao’s letter, there were 161 other letters of support seeking leniency from family members, friends and others.  Zhao’s sister, Jessica Zhao, who was a former Managing Director at Morgan Stanley, said that although her brother has made mistakes, he lives to do well for others. She cited the example of the FTX fallout and said Zhao ensured Binance never misused any customer funds.  He Yi, another Binance co-founder and mother of CZ’s three children, wrote, “If the cryptocurrency industry is compared to the Wild West, then CZ is the guardian of this wilderness.”  “Even the U.S. has not decided how to regulate and define this industry,” Yi wrote. As a founder who has never managed a company of this size, he was sure to encounter blind spots.”  His wife Yang Weiqing, with whom Zhao raised two children, stated the example of how Binance donated tens of millions of yen to the disaster-stricken areas of Japan in 2018, despite having withdrawn from the Japanese market just months before.  Zhao’s children, Rachel and Ryan, both students in U.S. universities, provided anecdotes of a supportive father and asked the Judge not to define Zhao's character solely through this one incident.  A notable letter of support came from Tigran Gambaryan, Binance’s Head of Financial Crime Compliance and a former special agent in the U.S. Department of Treasury, who is languishing in a Nigerian jail at the moment in a dispute between Binance and Nigeria. The letter was written on January 1, 2024, before he was arrested.  “While acknowledging CZ’s prior missteps, I can attest to his integrity, business insight, and philanthropic actions have had a ripple effect, influencing not only Binance’s corporate philosophy but also positively impacting lives globally,” Gambaryan wrote.  Letters of support also came from Max S. Baucus, former U.S. Ambassador to China, Professor Jeremy R. Cooperstock, McGill University, Associate Professor Ronghui Gu, Columbia University, Morgan Stanley Managing Director Sean Yang, and members of the ruling family in the United Arab Emirates.

42408410,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaIeZa,1713956937,"Number of Stablecoin Holders Nears 100M Mark, Data Show","The number of addresses holding stablecoins has risen 15% this year.  Rating agency S&P 500 said regulatory clarity could bring banks into the stablecoin market.  Stablecoins are hotter than ever. The number of addresses holding dollar and crypto-pegged stablecoins has increased 15% this year to above 93.6 million, the highest on record, according to data source rwa.xyz.  Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies with values pegged to an external reference, like the U.S. dollar. They can be broadly categorized as fiat-backed, crypto-backed, or algorithmic stablecoins. As of the time of writing, there are 35 stablecoins in existence, boasting a combined market capitalization of $157 billion.  Tether (USDT) holders, with an industry-leading market cap of $114.07 billion, accounted for just over 80% of the total stablecoin addresses, followed by USDC and BUSD.  The tally of the so-called holding addresses increased even during the 2022 crypto bear market. The Fed raised interest rates rapidly in 2022, boosting investor demand for the U.S. dollar and greenback-equivalents like the dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies.  Not only that, but the number of addresses transferring stablecoins has also increased rapidly over the years. In March alone, active stablecoin addresses rose past the 26 million mark for the first time on record, per rwa.xyz.  Details show that nearly 20 million, or 77% of those addresses, were based on TRON and Binance Smart Chain (BSC), largely representing retail investor participation.  “Zooming in and looking at transfer volumes, one notices that despite the dominant active address counts, TRON and BSC are a minority of $ volumes, demonstrating their popularity amongst retail participants,” crypto analytics newsletter OurNetwork’s April 23 edition said.  OurNetwork added that Ethereum, the world’s largest smart contract blockchain, and its rival Solana accounted for a giant share of the transfer volume due to their large decentralized finance ecosystem.  Stablecoin use cases  A 2022 report by the Federal Reserve said stablecoins could be used for several purposes, including cross-border payments, internal fund transfers, and liquidity management within firms.  Moreover, a single stablecoin can serve a different purpose depending on jurisdiction. For instance, in high-inflation nations like Zimbabwe and Nigeria, stablecoins have been adopted as alternative means of payment, remittances, and stores of value assets. Meanwhile, in advanced economies, stablecoins are widely used to fund cryptocurrency purchases.  Tether LTD, the company behind USDT, recently partnered with Telegram Open Network (TON), issuing $60 million of USDT on the TON blockchain.  “This deal deploys USDT onto the blockchain of the eponymous messaging app, opening the door for native usage of Tether to the nearly billion Telegram users,” OurNetwork said.  Regulation is the key  According to rating agency S&P, regulatory clarity will likely encourage banks to adopt stablecoins. Last week, U.S. Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) introduced a joint 179-page bill on regulating stablecoins.  “Assuming the bill is approved, and that relevant banking regulation follows, the new rules may offer banks a competitive advantage by limiting institutions without a banking license to a maximum issuance of $10 billion,"" S&P said.  S&P added that USDT, which is issued by a non-U.S. entity, is not a permitted payment stablecoin under the proposed bill, meaning stateside entities will not be able to hold or transact in tether. As such, tether’s dominance could wane and users will likely switch to U.S.-issued stablecoins.",POSITIVE,USDT | TON,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | USDT | TON,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/24/number-of-stablecoin-holders-nears-100m-mark-data-show,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/11a23c12349809e1d8be2143b2c6c30b37504b57-3840x2160.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

26303802,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=604814,1713951308,Bullish On Polkadot: Analyst Sees DOT Hitting $15 Soon,"Polkadot (DOT), the interoperable blockchain platform designed for connecting different blockchains, is currently caught in a tug-of-war between technical indicators suggesting a potential price dip and bullish predictions from some analysts. Recent price movements paint a somewhat gloomy picture. DOT breached the lower boundary of its ascending trend channel, a technical indicator often interpreted as a sign of weakening momentum. Related Reading: Solana Meme Coin Massacre: 12 Projects Gone In 30 Days, $27 Million Vanished Trading volume also leans bearish, with sellers dominating the market and putting downward pressure on the price. Support seems to be holding around $6.30, but resistance sits stubbornly at $9.40, hindering any upward movement. Polkadot Consolidation Or Correction? However, not everyone is ready to count DOT out. Proponents point to a bullish flag pattern, suggesting a consolidation phase. This consolidation, they argue, is a healthy pause after recent fluctuations and allows for accumulation before the next significant price move. This interpretation finds support from prominent crypto analysts like World of Charts. They believe the current price action is a bullish flag, a technical pattern often seen as a precursor to a breakout. Should this breakout occur, they predict a surge in value, with DOT potentially reaching $15 in the coming weeks. $Dot#Dot Consolidating In Bullish Flag In H4 Timeframe Expecting Upside Breakout & Incase Of Successful Breakout Expecting Move Towards 15$ In Coming Weeks #Crypto pic.twitter.com/nZkfjMoeDL — World Of Charts (@WorldOfCharts1) April 22, 2024 Uncertain Future For Polkadot? The conflicting technical signals make Polkadot’s future trajectory difficult to predict. The short-term outlook appears shaky, with potential for a price dip in the coming days or weeks. However, the long-term picture remains more optimistic. Polkadot’s core technology offers a compelling solution for blockchain interoperability, a major hurdle in the crypto industry. If the project continues to develop and gain traction, a significant price increase in the future remains a possibility. Total crypto market cap currently at $2.3 trillion. Chart: TradingView While the potential for a $15 price tag in the coming weeks is enticing, the current technical indicators suggest caution. Ultimately, the price of Polkadot, like all cryptocurrencies, remains highly volatile and susceptible to unforeseen events. The coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether the bulls or the bears will prevail in this ongoing battle. Polkadot JAM Protocol: Integrating Ethereum Smart Contracts, Boosting DOT’s Potential In another development, Polkadot has been at the forefront of blockchain innovation, drawing significant attention from industry stakeholders with recent developments and promising future prospects. A notable milestone is the unveiling of the Join-Accumulate Machine (JAM) Gray Paper, representing a fusion of Polkadot and Ethereum protocols. Related Reading: XRP: 600 Million Token Influx As Whales Make Their Presence Felt This protocol, as explained by the team, aims to establish a global singleton permissionless object environment akin to Ethereum’s smart-contract ecosystem, while also integrating secure sideband computation parallelized across a scalable node network, a concept pioneered by Polkadot. Moreover, the JAM protocol introduces a crucial service supporting existing parachains, allowing developers to continue utilizing Substrate for blockchain deployment. This integration of Polkadot’s infrastructure with Ethereum’s smart contract capabilities and its commitment to DOT underscores a strategic alignment towards interoperability and scalability, potentially reshaping the landscape of decentralized applications and blockchain development.

The confusion around this directive comes after an ongoing saga between Binance and Nigeria's government, which has made international headlines.  UPDATE (April 24, 2024, 13:54 UTC): Updates story and headline to reflect Nigeria's denial of the documents.  Nigeria's central bank denied that it issued a directive asking regulated financial institutions in the country to identify persons or entities transacting in or operating with Bybit, KuCoin, OKX and Binance.  The denial came not long after CoinDesk reported that such a directive had been issued. A person familiar with the matter told CoinDesk that multiple market players have received the document.  After the CoinDesk report, the central bank issued a denial which was then deleted – but then it was later reissued via X. The Central Bank of Nigeria did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for comment.  The document CoinDesk reported on was addressed to deposit money banks (DMBs), non-bank financial institutions (NBFls), other financial institutions (OFIs) and members of the public. It also cautioned and reminded the institutions that dealing in cryptocurrencies or facilitating payments for cryptocurrency exchanges is prohibited.  The document also stated that the central bank wants financial institutions to ""ensure that such accounts are put on PND (Post No Debit) instruction for 6 months"" and that breaches of the directive would attract severe regulatory sanctions. It said that any perpetrator or ""suspected agent"" secretly working with all cryptocurrency platforms, ""buying and selling USDT illegally,"" will be arrested.  The confusion comes amid an ongoing saga between Binance and Nigeria's government, which has made international headlines. The Nigerian government accused Binance of enabling currency speculation that crashed its currency, the naira, invited two of its executives into the country, then arrested them, and one of them escaped.

42408392,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaIdpI,1713945880,Bitcoin Bulls Pin Hopes on Weaker Dollar to Extend Rally,"The Dollar Index's (DXY) recent pullback has crypto traders betting on a continued weakness in the greenback and a renewed bitcoin rally.  Societe Generale and Scotiabank expect the dollar to remain firm due to divergent interest rate expectations.  Barclays said a potential escalation of trade war between the U.S. and China could bode well for the dollar.  Crypto traders are anticipating a renewed weakness in the U.S. dollar, which would catalyze risk-taking and extend the rally in bitcoin {{BTC}}. However, some banks are forecasting continued dollar strength.  Since mid-March, bitcoin has mainly traded between $60,000 and $70,000, CoinDesk data show. The rally in bitcoin, which began in October last year, has paused, likely due to dwindling expectations of Fed rate cuts and a bounce in the dollar index, which tracks the greenback’s value against major fiat currencies.  The DXY picked up a bid at 102.35 on March 8 and rose to a five-month high of 106.52 last week, according to data from charting platform TradingView. Since then, it has pulled back slightly to 105.70, giving hope to crypto bulls.  “DXY dollar index hit resistance at 106 as expected and has started to turn over. A move back towards 102-103 will turbocharge this rally. The timing makes sense because bitcoin is primed to move to $90,000 in the short term. Longer term, I expect DXY at 92, perhaps by late 2025,” Mike Alfred, a value investor and founder and managing partner at value fund Alpine Fox LP, said on X Tuesday.  The U.S. dollar is a global reserve and invoicing currency, playing a major role in international debt, non-bank borrowing, and global trade. When the dollar appreciates, USD-denominated debt becomes expensive, which, in turn, disincentivizes risk-taking in financial markets. A weaker dollar has the opposite effect. As such, over the years, bitcoin and the broader crypto market have tended to move in the opposite direction of the DXY, just as stocks and gold.  Jan Happel and Yan Allemann, co-founders of Glassnode, who go by the name Negentropic on X, said the dollar looks to have topped out in an “expanding triangle” pattern and could slide in the coming weeks, powering the crypto market higher.  The expanding triangle is identified by diverging trendlines connecting higher highs and lower lows. The DXY has turned lower from the upper trendline resistance and could fall toward 103 next month.  Banks bullish on the dollar  Some banks, however, do not foresee immediate dollar weakness.  According to Societe Generale’s Cross Asset Research Team led by Kit Juckes, the Fed is now unlikely to cut rates before 2025, and that could see the DXY peak somewhere between 107 and 110.  “If the market now adjusts to our forecast of lower rates in 1Q25 (and no further hikes), then peak 2s [two-year yield] should be around 5-51/4%, pointing to some, but not much more, DXY upside,” the research team said in a note to clients on April 18.  “Overall, if the Fed is on hold for the rest of this year and other central banks ease as expected, the peak DXY level should be in the 107-110 range,” the team added, expressing the possibility of the market overshooting the projected upside target.  In October, when the DXY peaked above 107, and bitcoin began the uptrend, markets expected the Fed to cut rates by 100 basis points in 2024. As of now, markets expect less than two rate cuts this year.  Scotiabank voiced a similar opinion in a note to clients on April 18, saying, “A higher for longer Fed likely means a strong for longer USD.”  U.S. tariffs are dollar bullish  Crypto traders might want to monitor potential trade war escalation between the U.S. and China, which could support the U.S. dollar.  Last week, U.S. President Joe Biden called for a steep increase in the tariff rate on Chinese steel and aluminum products to 25% from 7.5%. A tariff is a tax levied by governments on the value, including freight and insurance, of imported products and, in theory, adds to inflation.  Meanwhile, former President and current Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has proposed implementing a tariff rate of 60% or more on Chinese imports.  According to Barclays, that could push the dollar higher.  “U.S. tariffs tend to support the dollar via the import substitution channel, but the size of the FX impact depends crucially on the details, Barclays’ FX strategy team said in a client note last week.  Barclays stress-tested the scenario of the U.S. imposing a 60% tariff on all Chinese imports and concluded that a Trump victory later this year could spark a 3% rally in DXY.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/24/bitcoin-bulls-pin-hopes-on-weaker-dollar-to-extend-rally,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0469313dfda8d51565fcec0eeb87746d4b45ae47-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42408398,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaIe5p,1713945064,What’s at Stake for Crypto in India as the World’s Largest Democracy Is in the Midst of Its National Election?,"India's multi-phased election kicked off earlier this month and the manifestos of the major political parties have not made any crypto-specific promises.  However, promises related to the digitization of the nation have been made, even if crypto is at best a negligible issue for voters.  India’s general election in 2024 is not expected to immediately affect crypto policy, and its current – restrictive – rules are expected to continue on through the upcoming Parliamentary term.  The world’s most populated country and the fastest growing major economy kicked off its multi-phased elections this month, with results expected on June 4, 2024. Several industry analysts told CoinDesk they don't expect any changes to crypto policy after the next term's lawmakers are elected, resulting in the near-term continuation of rules that have stifled the nation's digital asset ecosystem.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi, 73, is aiming for a third five-year term as the face of the ruling Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP), and is overwhelmingly expected to win the elections, pre-election surveys have shown.  Such is his expected dominance that the Indian National Congress (INC), the major opposition party and several regional parties, around 40 in total, have come together to form a coalition called I.N.D.I.A (Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance) to fight him.  The election is for 543 seats in the lower house of Parliament, referred to as the Lok Sabha. The party or alliance with the most seats would select the country's prime minister and form a government.  Crypto as an election issue  Crypto’s significance as an election issue remains non-existent or at best negligible. Web3 remains esoteric for an overwhelming majority of the voting population. Even the fact that India has implemented a steep tax deducted at source on crypto transactions (1% on every transaction) is unlikely to play a role in this year's election in any major way.  Issues such as lack of jobs, a Hindu-nationalist agenda against a constitutionally enshrined secularism, alleged marginalization of minorities, the role of electoral bonds, institutional independence and agrarian policies have dominated the headlines, making sure that crypto is not even a political talking point.  “Indian elections are still focussed mainly around socio-political issues,” said Kiran Vivekananda, Chief Public Policy officer at one of India’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, CoinDCX. “Technology has started becoming an agenda item but is more from the setting up [of a] manufacturing base in India and the job-creation lens.”  Yet, Vivekananda expressed hope that the incoming government would work more closely with the industry to understand its challenges, provide solutions and protect the interests of citizens. However, other entrepreneurs believe more needs to be done by the Indian crypto industry.  “Developments in the U.S. show that crypto can indeed become a political talking point, influencing policy and voter choices,” said Ashish Khandelwal, founder of Anq, a digital banking platform and a person who has been engaging with legislators. “To mirror the U.S., the Indian crypto industry needs to highlight how the tech can offer more than just investment opportunities, creating awareness around tangible benefits.”  No crypto-related promises  Neither major party, Modi’s BJP nor the INC, have mentioned the words cryptocurrency, blockchain or Web3 in their manifestos. However, this isn’t necessarily reflective of their plans toward the ecosystem. Indian government and political stakeholders, like other nations, have often used euphemisms to refer to the crypto-related space.  The ruling BJP’s manifesto said the party would educate senior citizens to avoid digital scams, take stringent action against those who threaten the nation’s digital sovereignty and would develop “Digital Public Infrastructure to remove information asymmetry in agriculture.”  The Congress Party (another name for INC) said it would give farmers the option to upload the sale-and-purchase agreement of the produce on a “digital ledger” and “work on digital/cybersecurity issues that may threaten India's digital financial infrastructure.”  So far, during Modi's second term, his crypto-related policies included stiff taxes including a 30% tax on profits from selling digital assets, no off-setting of losses, a 1% tax deducted at source for every transaction and mandated registration of exchanges with India’s anti-money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog. These policies and other enforcement related actions brought the industry to its knees.  Only the recent bull run and the government’s banning of off-shore exchanges at the nudging of India’s crypto policy advocacy body appears to have brought some respite to the industry.  The Modi government “has consistently maintained a lukewarm stance towards cryptocurrencies,” putting in place a “patchwork of regulations,” said Mohit Chawdhry, a fellow at the Esya Centre Think Tank which has extensively researched how the crypto policies have so far impacted the industry.  A weak opposition party has not framed a comprehensive position on crypto policy, though at this point it is simply fighting for survival against the Modi juggernaut.  No major changes in the near-term  Regardless of how Parliament shakes out, India’s Web3 policies are expected to remain largely unchanged in the near future.  In the more likely scenario of Modi winning, his policies are expected to continue, and even if they would be updated, crypto is unlikely to be an immediate priority. Modi’s government has made no public indications that once it comes to power, crypto policy may be updated.  In another, less likely, scenario of the opposition alliance winning, the coalition government is likely to have other priorities. The coalition has not yet indicated any thoughts on how its members may approach crypto policy.  The best case scenario for a change in India’s crypto policy is around the end of 2024,  one person familiar with the framing of crypto regulations in the government but unauthorized to speak to reporters told CoinDesk.  And this isn't due to any specific policies that may be updated or introduced – it will simply take the government months to transition into governing after election results are announced in six weeks.  The Modi government “does not appear to be keen on a holistic policy framework for virtual digital assets,” said the Esya Centre's Chawdhry. “It seems that other emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and extended reality, are higher priorities for policymakers.”  Recently, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman remained slightly ambiguous about crypto, saying the government’s position has always been that crypto assets can be traded, but that the government hasn't regulated them in the past, and won't change that stance yet.  Some change by 2025  The past few years of the Modi government indicate changes will come.  One of the major achievements touted by the Modi government has been its role in shaping globally coordinated crypto policy under its 2023 presidency of the Group of 20. India made it a priority and brought the major economies of the world to agree to a set of guidelines.  India has also purportedly achieved its ambitions with the digital rupee.  ""The policymaking process for crypto will definitely pick up pace in this (expected and upcoming) term of the Modi government,” said Tanvi Ratna, the founder and CEO of the emerging technology think tank Policy 4.0, which contributed to key research and inputs towards the G20 policy framework created under India.  “We can expect a close alignment between the government strategy [and] the global framework agreed by the G20 under India's leadership. Also worth noting that India's crypto policy will evolve alongside the scale up and launch of the eRupee. We are looking towards a very dynamic five years in India,” Ratna said.

26299070,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=604798,1713942905,How To Outperform In Crypto: Arthur Hayes’ ‘Left Curve’ Strategy,"In his latest essay, Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX, introduced a bold investment philosophy he calls the “Left Curve.” This strategy diverges sharply from traditional investment approaches typically adopted during bull markets in the crypto world. Hayes’ essay serves not only as an investment manifesto but also as a critique of conventional financial wisdom, encouraging investors to maximize their returns by embracing more aggressive tactics. Crypto Bull Run Just Got Started Hayes begins by criticizing the common investor mentality that prevails during bull markets, particularly the tendency to revert to conservative strategies after initial gains. He argues that many investors, despite having made profitable decisions, fail to capitalize fully on bull markets by selling their holdings too soon—particularly when they convert high-performing cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies. “Some of you think you are masters of the universe right now because you bought Solana sub $10 and sold it at $200,” he states, challenging the notion that such actions demonstrate market mastery. Instead, Hayes promotes a strategy of sustained investment and accumulation, particularly in Bitcoin, which he refers to as “the hardest money ever created.” Related Reading: Akash Network (AKT) Leads Crypto Top 100 With 46% Rise Today: Here’s Why A central thesis of Hayes’ argument is the critique of fiat currency as a safe haven for profits taken from cryptocurrency investments. “If you sold shitcoins for fiat that you don’t immediately need for living expenses, you are fucking up,” Hayes bluntly asserts. He discusses the inherent weaknesses of fiat money, primarily its susceptibility to inflation and devaluation through endless cycles of printing by central banks. “Fiat will continue to be printed ad infinitum until the system resets,” he predicts, suggesting that fiat currencies are inherently unstable storage of value compared to cryptocurrencies. Hayes extends his analysis to the macroeconomic factors influencing cryptocurrency markets. He describes how major economies like the US, China, the European Union, and Japan are debasing their currencies to manage national debt levels. This macroeconomic maneuvering, according to Hayes, is inadvertently setting the stage for cryptocurrencies to rise. He points out the increasing adoption of Bitcoin ETFs in the US, UK, and Hong Kong markets as a tool for institutional and retail investors to hedge against fiat depreciation. Related Reading: ‘More Upside Is Coming’: Crypto Market Set For 350% Growth, Predicts Glassnode Cofounders This part of his analysis underscores a broader acceptance of cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class in traditional investment circles, powered by the realization that traditional financial systems are struggling under the weight of unsustainable fiscal policies. Hayes also delves into the strategic aspects of market timing, particularly around events known to influence market dynamics, such as US tax payment deadlines and Bitcoin halving. He notes: As we exit the window of weakness that I forecasted would occur due to April 15th US tax payments and the Bitcoin halving, I want to remind readers why the bull market will continue and prices will get sillier on the upside. This observation suggests that understanding these cyclic events can provide strategic entry and exit points for maximizing investment returns. Emphasizing psychological resilience, Hayes encourages investors to adopt a mindset that resists the conventional impulse to cash out during brief market rallies. “At this moment, I will resist the urge to take chips off the table. I will encourage myself to add more to the winners,” he advises, promoting a long-term view of investment in cryptocurrencies. This approach, according to Hayes, is essential for realizing the full potential of crypto investments, particularly in a market characterized by high volatility and rapid gains. In conclusion, Hayes’ “Left Curve” philosophy is more than just an investment strategy; it is a comprehensive approach that encompasses understanding macroeconomic trends, psychological resilience, and strategic market timing. His essay serves as a guide for investors looking to navigate the complexities of crypto markets with a bold, assertive strategy that challenges traditional financial doctrines.

The HBAR Foundation, which supports the Hedera ecosystem, announced Tuesday that shares in BlackRock's ICS U.S. Treasury money market fund had been tokenized on the Hedera blockchain in collaboration with Archax. Hedera supporters on social media read that to mean that BlackRock chose Hedera to tokenize its fund, and sent the blockchain's native HBAR token up more than 107%.  But while shares in BlackRock fund had indeed been tokenized, it wasn't the world's largest asset manager that did the tokenizing. Once the market realized this, HBAR slipped 25%. To be clear, both the release from the HBAR Foundation and the one from Archax were transparent as to the structure of the arrangement, but as so often happens with crypto Twitter, people hear and read what they want to hear and read.  Archax CEO Graham Rodford said ""it was indeed an Archax choice to put [the fund] on Hedera,"" in response to criticism about overstated claims by Hedera supporters.  BlackRock entered the real-world asset (RWA) tokenization sector last month when it launched its USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund on Ethereum.  The HBAR token is still up by 61% over the past 24 hours, but the 2% market depth remains relatively thin, with $900,000 in cumulative bids on the Binance and Upbit order books within 2% of the current price of 14 cents. The token has over $2.6 billion in trading volume over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.  CoinGlass data shows funding rates across all derivative exchanges are heavily negative, which means those holding short positions have to pay those holding long positions, indicating a bearish bias. The ratio of longs and shorts on Binance is currently 0.85.  The weighted short interest, coupled with a lack of liquidity, creates a landscape for a volatile trading period that could culminate in a return to parity or a short squeeze, with open interest having risen by 442% to $160 million in the past 24 hours.  UPDATE (April 24, 2024, 15:05 UTC): Edits headline, subhead and first three paragraphs for clarity.  CORRECTION (April 24, 21:59 UTC): Corrects article throughout to say that the HBAR Foundation, not Hedera, announced the tokenization.

Voting in Mexico will take place on June 2, with results expected between June 5 to June 8.  Mexico is poised to have its biggest election ever in a few weeks, with 100 million voters choosing 628 elected officials, thousands of local officials and the president. And crypto issues will remain on the sidelines during the campaign.  The future of crypto will be determined by which party and presidential candidate takes over from President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who cannot run again under the constitution.  The three way battle for the presidency falls between Mexico City’s former mayor Claudia Sheinbaum fielded by the ruling left-wing Morena party, Senator Xóchitl Gálvez from the Strength and Heart for Mexico coalition and former legislative deputy Jorge Álvarez Máynez of the Citizen Movement party.  According to the polls, Sheinbaum is the favorite to win the presidency, with Gálvez and Máynez respectively a distant second and third.  Sheinbaum has indicated that the economic-integration between the U.S. and Mexico is such that whoever, Donald Trump or Joe Biden, comes to power, she’s confident of having a good relationship with both, if she came to power. Mexico is the largest market for remittances from the U.S. Her party’s government has so far kept crypto on the sidelines of financial integration, imposing a 20% tax on crypto gains, but without comprehensive legislation. A fintech law and other regulations require cryptocurrency exchanges in the nation to be registered under global requirements for anti-money laundering and terror financing.  Sheinbaum’s party has been projecting a focus on regulating blockchain to make the technology and ecosystem more secure.  In the unlikely event that any of the other contenders come to power, crypto still may not be front and center as a priority. Mexico has seen dozens of candidates murdered in the build up to this election reflecting cartel violence is one of the leading issues among corruption and migration  Still Gálvez and Álvarez Máynez’s party, have in separate ways, advocated for using blockchain to fight corruption in government and the real state sector, said Pavel Salas, chief growth officer at Gear.

42408399,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaIe2W,1713940312,Tether Will Freeze Wallets Evading Venezuelan Sanctions,"A tether spokesperson said that it will freeze addresses linked to evading sanctions.  Reuters reported earlier this week that Venezuelan oil company PDVSA was using USDT via intermediaries to bypass U.S. sanctions.  Venezuela’s original crypto project, Petro, was shut down earlier this year.  Stablecoin issuer Tether has said it will freeze wallets that are using USDT to evade sanctions on oil exports in Venezuela.  The decision comes after Reuters reported that Venezuela’s state-run oil company PDVSA increased its use of tether after the U.S. reimposed sanctions on oil exports.  The firm froze 41 wallets tied to the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list in December.  “Tether respects the OFAC SDN list and is committed to working to ensure sanction addresses are frozen properly,” a Tether spokesperson told CoinDesk.  PDVSA’s use of USDT, which began last year, has accelerated following the U.S.’s decision to reimpose sanctions due to concerns over Venezuela’s upcoming election.  Venezuela began experimenting with cryptocurrencies in 2018, setting up a token called “petro” as it aimed to tackle economic instability spurred by U.S. sanctions. The token was shelved earlier this year following a lack of adoption.  Using cryptocurrencies allows PDVSA and its counterparties to avoid transacting in cash that could be seized by the U.S. in foreign bank accounts. Reuters reports that PDVSA uses intermediaries when transacting in tether to make transfers harder to track.  OFAC is privy to the use of crypto, having increased its clamp down on the industry over the past year, fining crypto exchange CoinList $1.2 million for aiding Russian users evade sanctions in December after imposing sanctions on a crypto mixer that was allegedly used by hackers in North Korea.

26296929,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=604781,1713939294,XRP: 600 Million Token Influx As Whales Make Their Presence Felt,"The cryptocurrency market continues to grapple with volatility, and XRP has been no exception. After a promising start to the year, the price of XRP has mirrored the broader market slump triggered by Bitcoin’s correction. However, amidst the bearish sentiment, a different story is unfolding underwater – one involving deep-pocketed investors, or “whales,” accumulating the altcoin at a significant clip. Related Reading: Solana Meme Coin Massacre: 12 Projects Gone In 30 Days, $27 Million Vanished XRP Whales Accumulate Millions Despite Price Drop While the price of XRP has dipped considerably from its highs in March, whale addresses have been quietly going on a buying spree. According to data from market intelligence platform Santiment, analyzed by market researcher Ali Martinez, addresses holding between 10 million and 100 million XRP have been steadily adding to their holdings since early April. This buying frenzy intensified after XRP’s sharp price drop in mid-April, with whales capitalizing on the lower prices in a classic “buy-the-dip” strategy. $XRP dropped from $0.62 to $0.41, and #crypto whales took notice. They’ve bought over 31 million #XRP in just the past week! pic.twitter.com/3FCA3PR3hi — Ali (@ali_charts) April 23, 2024 The data reveals that these whales have scooped up a staggering 30 million XRP tokens in the past week alone, bringing their cumulative holdings to a hefty 6.75 billion units. This buying spree indicates a potential shift in sentiment among these large investors, who seem unfazed by the short-term price fluctuations and might be betting on XRP’s long-term prospects. Deeper Dive: Whale Activity Hints At Bullish Sentiment Taking a deeper dive, latest data suggests that this accumulation trend began even earlier, on April 5th. Interestingly, this coincides with the tail end of a selling period by these same whales, where they offloaded some of their holdings. However, since April 5th, the buying spree has been relentless, with whales amassing over 600 million XRP in just two weeks. This significant accumulation suggests a renewed confidence in XRP, potentially signaling a bullish outlook from these key market players. Total crypto market cap currently at $2.391 trillion. Chart: TradingView Further bolstering this notion is the recent surge in the number of addresses holding at least 1 million XRP. These “mid-tier whales” have been steadily increasing, with their ranks reaching a near-record high of 2,013 on Tuesday. This broader participation from various tiers of large investors adds weight to the idea that XRP might be undervalued at its current price point. 🐳 The price of #XRP has jumped ahead of the #altcoin pack, jumping +6% and as high as $0.5687 today. The amount of wallets, 2,013, holding at least 1M $XRP has been surging over the past six weeks (rising 3.1%), and is within 1 wallet of the #AllTimeHigh. https://t.co/2ZfC9v79x9 pic.twitter.com/rqKgcOYJJx — Santiment (@santimentfeed) April 22, 2024 XRP Outperforms Other Altcoins Meanwhile, Santiment disclosed that XRP is outpacing the other altcoins in terms of wallet size. Wallets holding 1 million or more coins have increased, with a 3% gain over the last six weeks. The increase of significant XRP holdings indicates that investors’ interest and confidence are rising.

42408400,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaIe98,1713937429,"Binance Founder Changpeng Zhao Should Spend 3 Years in Prison, DOJ Says","Binance's founder and former chief executive, Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, should spend three years in prison for his role in enabling the crypto exchange to violate federal sanctions and money laundering laws, the U.S. Department of Justice said Tuesday night. The former CEO's attorneys argued he should serve no jail time, citing the fine he paid and his ""extraordinary acceptance of responsibility.""  Attorneys with the DOJ filed a sentencing memo arguing he should spend 36 months in prison and pay a $50 million fine after he pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act last November. Hours later, Zhao's defense team filed its own sentencing memo, saying ""no defendant in a remotely similar BSA case has ever been sentenced to incarceration."" Instead, they suggested he be sentenced to probation, which could include home confinement at his home in Abu Dhabi.  ""The sentence in this case will not just send a message to Zhao but also to the world. Zhao reaped vast rewards for his violation of U.S. law, and the price of that violation must be significant to effectively punish Zhao for his criminal acts and to deter others who are tempted to build fortunes and business empires by breaking U.S. law,"" the filing said.  Zhao originally faced up to 18 months in prison under the terms of his plea agreement. The DOJ argued in Tuesday's filing that ""the scope and ramifications of Zhao's misconduct were massive,"" and so ""an upward variance is appropriate here.""  ""In part because Zhao failed to implement an effective AML program at Binance, illicit actors used Binance’s exchange in various ways, including operating mixing services that hid the source and ownership of cryptocurrency; transacting in illicit proceeds from ransomware attacks; and moving proceeds of darknet market transactions, exchange hacks, and various internet-related scams,"" the filing said, pointing to fund movements from darknet markets and crypto mixers.  Much of the filing echoes arguments made by the DOJ when it first announced charges against Binance and Zhao last year, pointing to how the exchange operated within the U.S.  The filing also walks through the DOJ's sentencing guidelines calculations, noting that the guidelines recommend 12 to 18 months, but saying Zhao knew Binance was violating the law and encouraged it.  The filing also took aim at how the Sentencing Guidelines address Bank Secrecy Act violations, saying they ""are not designed to adequately punish either misconduct on this scale or misconduct that harms U.S. national security.""  The $50 million fine was already agreed to by both the prosecution and Zhao's defense team. Zhao also waived the right to appeal any sentence up to 18 months.  Read more: Binance Founder Changpeng Zhao Apologizes Ahead of Sentencing, 161 Others Send Letters of Support  Defense pushes back  Zhao did not know and was never ""explicitly informed"" of specific transactions on Binance with criminal funds, his defense filing said.  ""Although Probation references a conversation in which Binance’s chief compliance officer warned Mr. Zhao that there were users from sanctioned countries on Binance.com ... the reality is that Binance, as a non-U.S. company, was not prohibited from having users from U.S.-sanctioned countries on its platform,"" the filing said. By contrast, the sanctions charge to which the Company pleaded is a novel and narrow one (applied for the first time against Binance) that an algorithmic matching engine violates U.S. sanctions law by randomly pairing users in sanctioned countries with users in the United States.""  Those transactions only made up a microscopically tiny portion of Binance's trading volume, the filing said, making it ""inconceivable that Mr. Zhao acted knowingly and deliberately to bring them about.""  Zhao also does not pose any risk of recidivism, the filing argued, saying that he should be sentenced to probation instead of prison.  Parts of the memo are redacted, though the sections immediately following the redacted portions reference Zhao's background and letters of support.  Zhao's supporters include Yi He, the mother of three of his children, his former wife Yang Weiqing, his two adult children with Yang, former U.S. Senator and current Binance lobbyist Max Baucus and a few dozen other individuals.  He was originally set to be sentenced in late February, but the hearing was postponed by mutual agreement to April 30. He hasn't been able to return to Dubai, where his partner and some of his children live, since he first appeared in federal court in Seattle, Washington last year.  Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, pleaded guilty to charges of its own at the same time as Zhao, agreeing to a massive $4.3 billion fine and that it would report to a court-appointed monitor. The monitor has yet to be appointed.  UPDATE (April 24, 2024, 06:05 UTC): Adds additional detail.

The president said he is aware of indications of money laundering through crypto assets amounting to $8.6 billion (139 trillion IDR) in 2021, referring to data from the 2022 Crypto Crime Report by Chainalysis,  “This amount, equivalent to Rp 139 trillion globally, is not just large – it is extremely large,"" Widodo said during his address. ""We must move quickly and stay ahead of them. Otherwise, we will continually fall behind,"" he added.  Besides crypto and NFTs, the president – who is affectionately called “Jokowi” – also highlighted the need to monitor other potential tools for money laundering including virtual assets, marketplace activities, electronic money and AI-driven transactions.  Responding to the president's directive, Mahendra Siregar, chairman of the Board of Commissioners of the Financial Services Authority (OJK), said that his agency would oversee these concerns when crypto regulation transitions to the OJK next year.  ""In due course, as members of the Anti-Money Laundering and Terror Financing Prevention Team, we will have the authority to monitor these issues, including whether their use overlaps with services from other financial institutions,"" Mahendra said on Wednesday to reporters during a press conference.  Currently, crypto assets in Indonesia are considered commodities and are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency (Bappebti). According to Law Number 4 of 2023, the oversight of crypto assets will transition to the Financial Services Authority (OJK) in January 2025.

In the February 2024 elections, the newly elected president and vice president, Prabowo Subianto and Gibran Rakabuming Raka, openly expressed a strong interest in crypto.  Gibran, the son of current President Widodo, vocally emphasized that Indonesia needs blockchain and crypto experts to advance the country's technological sector during election campaign, while Prabowo and Gibran's National Campaign Deputy Chairman, Erwin Aksa, previously mentioned that Prabowo and Gibran will improve tax compliance supervision for crypto assets as many are not compliant in reporting taxes.

Bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}}, the crypto market leaders, continue to trade in tight ranges as traders reassess macro conditions after halving.  At press time, bitcoin {{BTC}} traded above $66,600 while ether {{ETH}} changed hands at $3,240, according to CoinDesk Indicies data.  After a volatile last few weeks involving missile strikes between two geopolitical foes and excitement about the bitcoin halving, a sense of calm has returned to the market, with bulls and bears unwilling to lead the price action.  ""After the halving, market volatility was somewhat muted,"" Jun-Young Heo, a trader at Presto, told CoinDesk. ""Recent three-day realized volatility was well below the implied volatility of BTC options, and investors may still need to gauge macroeconomic variables.""  Liquidation data from CoinGlass shows that in the last 12 hours, $52.46 million in positions have been liquidated. Ether and BTC positions are the largest, respectively, but there's also $6.86 million in HBAR liquidations – owing to the token's recent surge in volume crossing the $1 billion mark – as well as $1.83 million in PEPE liquidations.  Justin d'Anethan from Keyrock, a crypto market maker, said in a Telegram interview with CoinDesk that traders are indecisive and can't make up their minds on what position to take.  ""It's an interesting – albeit not very dynamic – market to look at, both on the crypto and traditional side; traders seem unable to decidedly turn bullish or bearish, as evidenced by prices staying put,"" he told CoinDesk.  The CoinDesk 20 Index, a measure of the largest digital assets by market cap, is flat, trading at 2,343.  ""There's a flurry of negative news weighing on markets,"" d'Anethan continued, pointing to the SEC's clear desire to delay the ETF application, President Joe Biden's comments about crypto mining, and continuing crypto investment product outflows.  ""On the flip side, and on a maybe more bullish side, the pullback we saw last week, which was intently caused by some leveraged long liquidations, has probably cleared some froth and left us sitting at a respectable level with some committed capital,"" he said.  Coinglass data says that over the weekend of April 12-13, when Iran launched its missile attack on Israel, over $1.4 billion in long positions were liquidated.  ""With the halving, crypto investors are not willing to part with their coins and are probably setting themselves up for higher prices long term.""

Related Reading: ‘More Upside Is Coming’: Crypto Market Set For 350% Growth, Predicts Glassnode Cofounders Market Sentiments And EMA Trends With Bitcoin’s value recently wavering below the $70,000 mark, a detailed analysis from the cofounders suggests that a strong support level around the $62,000 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) could set the stage for a significant rebound. This crucial support level indicates a strong buying sentiment, indicating the market’s confidence in the cryptocurrency’s value and a potential resistance against further declines.

Further analysis by the Glassnode cofounders delves into the behavior of EMAs over different durations. Short-term EMAs indicate a growing inclination among investors to buy, while longer-term EMAs lean towards selling. This contrasting behavior between short and long-term EMAs sheds light on the current phase of the market, which seems to be in a period of consolidation after the notable 92% increase in Bitcoin’s price over six weeks earlier in the year. Such insights are vital as they offer a deeper understanding of the underlying market forces and investor behavior during volatile periods. Meanwhile, Glassnode’s team’s analytical approach extends beyond simple price movements. Yesterday, they compared the current market conditions to the early 2021 “strong correction,” which they term “wave 4” of the ongoing market cycle. This historical perspective provides a lens through which current trends can be evaluated, suggesting a cyclic return to bullish conditions reminiscent of past market behaviors. Bitcoin Bullish Projections And Market Dynamics Bitfinex analysts have highlighted significant activities around Bitcoin withdrawals, supporting the optimistic outlook on Bitcoin. The current levels, echo those of January 2023, suggest that investors are increasingly moving their Bitcoin to cold storage—a sign that many anticipate further price increases.

42408413,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaIegC,1713922200,The Ever-Dwindling Chances for a Stablecoin Law,"Last week, U.S. Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) introduced a joint bill addressing how stablecoins could be regulated in the country. It's the latest effort to try and get something done in the U.S. legislative front – but is it enough?  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Stablecoin qs  The narrative  Last week, U.S. Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) introduced their latest joint bill, this time taking on stablecoins, the $160 billion section of the overall crypto market that's received a fair amount of attention recently – and is seen as the area where crypto legislation is most likely to actually happen. Which still isn't all that likely.  Why it matters  The new Lummis-Gillibrand bill is a lengthy proposal detailing how stablecoins issued by U.S. companies would be overseen, how they could maintain their peg (algos are out) and how consumers might be protected.  Breaking it down  The new Lummis-Gillibrand bill creates a framework for state and federal oversight of stablecoin issuers, details a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) process for possible collapses and bans algorithmic stablecoins outright.  Industry participants voiced a few immediate concerns about the new Lummis-Gillibrand bill, pointing to a lack of provisions accounting for crypto-backed tokens like DAI and the blanket ban on algorithmic stablecoins.  The bill has a comprehensive list of rules for stablecoins issued by U.S. companies but is far more limited in addressing foreign company-issued tokens, like Tether (USDT). A press release announcing the bill said ""malign actors will no longer have the option to use unregulated foreign stablecoins.""  At first blush, there doesn't appear to be a specific mechanism that would actually block them from doing so.  My colleague Jenn Sanasie asked Sen. Lummis on CoinDesk TV whether there was a specific mechanism that would prevent issuers based outside the U.S. from tapping U.S. customers.  ""This is very much oriented towards a U.S.-regulated company, and so Tether, if it chooses to remain offshore [and] is happier with a different regulator, that's a business choice for them,"" she said. ""But if they want the U.S. Good housekeeping stamp of approval on their product, and we hope they will, then they'll come into compliance in the U.S.""  Tether issues the world's largest stablecoin, the eponymous tether (USDT), with $110 billion worth of tokens in circulation according to CoinGecko. It's also the most liquid, with CoinGecko reporting some $38 billion in 24-hour volume (the next largest stablecoin by market cap is Circle's USDC, with $34 billion worth of tokens circulating and $6 billion in 24-hour volume). (I reached out to Tether spokespeople for comment, but haven't heard back.)  Circle, as it stands today, wouldn't be able to continue operating – there's a $10 billion limit, above which stablecoin issuers would need to be state or federally chartered depository institutions.  Lummis said she wanted the company to look at the bill and determine how its compliance practices might need to change to fit.  ""They probably have to get a federal charter, to be honest,"" she said.  It's also unclear to me how exactly this bill might treat stablecoins like DAI, which is issued by a decentralized entity but isn't an algorithmic stablecoin.  Time will tell where and how this bill will proceed.  The other major effort that seems to be underway comes from the House Financial Services Committee, with reports saying Chair Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) and Ranking Member Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) met with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) to discuss attaching a stablecoin bill to some other piece of legislation. It's unclear just what the current version of the House bill looks like (neither McHenry's nor Waters' spokespeople responded to requests for comment).  And perhaps most intriguingly, Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) said he could support a bill if it addressed consumer protection questions and had appropriate guardrails (spokespeople for Brown also didn't return a request for comment).  But of course, of course, of course, the clock is ticking. Lawmakers are already full swing in campaign mode. As we get to the summer, the chances of elected officials taking time off from the campaign trail for something as esoteric as stablecoins will be low. Any progress made will grind to a halt (and that's assuming we don't suddenly have another House speakership vacancy, though an effort to oust Mike Johnson seems to be wilting).  The more likely scenario is we may see passage during the lame-duck session, between the election and before the next Congress is sworn in. Even there, any bill would be attached to some must-pass piece of legislation, in all likelihood. This might be the next National Defense Authorization Act or some kind of budget bill.  How the stablecoin legislation efforts might evolve between now and then is anyone's guess, though with McHenry on his way out – he's not running for reelection – and Brown and Schumer apparently on board, there is still a better-than-negligible chance we will see a bill become a law by January.

26285027,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=604750,1713918639,Hedge Funds Fall For The Memecoin Frenzy: “Mind-Boggling” Returns Tempt Financial Giants,"In a recent Bloomberg report, it has come to light that the hedge fund industry is increasingly drawn to the allure of the memecoin sector, given the recent price increases and substantial profits that surpass those of Bitcoin (BTC) or the largest altcoins in the market. Related Reading: This Metric Printed In 2017 Before Bitcoin Exploded: Is A Mega Run Incoming? Memecoin Mania One example of the appeal of memecoins to traditional finance institutions is Newport Beach-based Stratos, which launched a liquid fund with the Dogwifhat token in December. The Solana-based memecoin Dogwifhat, known for its mascot – a beanie-wearing dog – became a major player in the crypto world, with its price increasing more than 300 times. This substantial spike reportedly helped Stratos achieve a staggering 137% return in the first quarter of 2024, outperforming gains in the broader crypto market. However, Dogwifhat has since retraced more than 35% from its March 31 all-time high (ATH) of $4.83 and is currently trading at $3.09. Interestingly, Stratos is not alone in venturing into memecoins; other hedge funds are also doing so. Asset manager Brevan Howard, for instance, has reportedly made a “tiny” investment in memecoins. Pantera Capital, a crypto fund, recently emphasized the staying power of memecoins and the “enormous” trading opportunities they present. Is It Just Gambling? Despite the enthusiasm from some hedge funds, the report notes that many crypto participants remain skeptical of memecoins. Quinn Thompson, the founder of Lekker Capital, a hedge fund experimenting with trading memecoins, likened the current frenzy to the speculative fervor seen in traditional markets with stocks like GameStop. In addition, Thompson described memecoins as the “tip of the spear for speculation” and emphasized the “gambling-like” nature of their trading. Still, Cosmo Jiang, a portfolio manager at Pantera Capital, noted the evolution of memecoins beyond mere jokes, calling some “culture coins” that symbolize membership in a particular group or belief system. The report notes that the ease of creating and launching memecoins has increased with the availability of apps like Pump.fun, which allow users to mint coins in minutes. Blockchains like Solana and Coinbase’s Base, which offer low trading fees, have been flooded with these tokens. In light of these developments, Josh de Vos, research lead at CCData, highlighted the improved infrastructure supporting memecoins, including increased liquidity and the development of advanced futures markets on centralized exchanges (CEX). As more hedge funds take memecoins seriously, Rennick Palley of Stratos anticipates a growing focus on these crypto assets. Drawing parallels to the initial skepticism surrounding cryptocurrencies, Palley suggests that meme-only funds may emerge, mirroring the creation of non-fungible token (NFT) funds. Related Reading: XRP Wallets Holding At Least 1 Million Coins Nears All-Time High As Sentiment Improves To further demonstrate the interest and adoption of these emerging tokens, in the first quarter of 2024, memecoins emerged as the most profitable crypto narrative, delivering massive average returns of 1312.6% across its top tokens, according to a recent study conducted by CoinGecko. Currently, the largest memecoin on the market, Dogecoin (DOGE), is trading at $0.1616, up 5% in the last seven days. It has a market cap of $23 billion.

BlockDAG (BDAG) is currently leading the pack with its innovative approach and robust financial backing (the current presale has garnered $19.8 million through the sales of 7.9 billion BDAG coins so far). Following closely are Bitget Token (BGT), Waves (WAVES), and Injective (INJ), each bringing unique innovations that could redefine the cryptocurrency industry. This article explores these promising cryptocurrencies and their potential as top picks for the next market surge. BlockDAG (BDAG) – Pioneering Blockchain’s Future BlockDAG stands out with a substantial $19.8 million raised in presale and a distribution of over 7.9 billion coins, challenging major players like Solana and Ethereum. With a current price of $0.005 and an expected increase to $0.006 in the next batch, BDAG is projected to reach up to $20 by 2027. Its integration of hybrid technology with user-friendly, low-code/no-code features positions BlockDAG as a frontrunner, making it a prime choice for investors targeting long-term growth and sustainability within the blockchain arena. Bitget Token (BGT) – Bullish Prospects on the Horizon Bitget Token continues to show bullish momentum within an ascending parallel channel, with its resilience highlighted by its recovery from average levels. BGT’s liquidity and bullish trends, along with an imminent MACD buy signal, suggest a potential rise to $1.5. This promising outlook positions BGT as an enticing investment for those betting on bullish market dynamics. Waves (WAVES) – Preparing for a Strong Rebound Despite recent setbacks, WAVES is poised for a comeback, supported by technical indicators that predict a resurgence. With the potential to climb back to, or even surpass $5, WAVES’s commitment to blockchain innovation continues to draw investor interest, bolstered by its historical resilience and active development in the blockchain technology space. Injective (INJ) – High Risk with Potential Rewards Injective’s market dynamics have been characterized by high volatility, presenting a high-risk, high-reward opportunity for investors. While current patterns suggest caution, the potential for a rebound exists, making INJ an appealing option for those willing to navigate higher risks in anticipation of possible moderate gains. Conclusion: BlockDAG Dominates as the Top Crypto Choice for 2024 Looking towards 2024, BDAG, BGT, WAVES, and INJ each offer unique advantages for investors preparing for the bull run. BlockDAG, with its advanced technology and strategic market presence, is particularly notable as the leading investment choice.
