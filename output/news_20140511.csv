42425664,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIeqVh,1399811417,Does Bitcoin's Falling Volume Herald a Bull Run?,"What’s happened to bitcoin transaction volumes? Over the last month, the number of bitcoins changing hands has dropped considerably.  In April, 109,932 bitcoins per day exchanged hands on average. That compares to 187,811 in March – a 41% drop.  This has continued a little into May. On 4th May, it sunk further still, with just 52,042 bitcoins changing hands in a day. Bitcoin has been lower than this before, but not for a while.  This chart shows that it only dipped below this figure three times in 2014 – twice in April and once in March. Before that, trading volume hadn’t been this low since 2011. What’s going on?  Gil Luria, Managing Director at Wedbush Securities, an equities firm that tracks the bitcoin market, said:  “If I was to narrow down to one factor, I would say China. If we talk about the ascent of bitcoin last year, it would be down to unencumbered growth with China.”  If bitcoin’s fortunes rested heavily on the increasing role of China-based participants in the market, then no wonder volume is falling, given the turmoil there, and its chilling effect on bitcoin.  The China Syndrome  Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) became the latest bank to block bitcoin in China this week, following a string of others that have done the same.  All of this has led up to a publicised but unofficial prohibition deadline of 10th May, allegedly imposed by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), by which date banks should have officially made a statement on the issue.  China’s media ban of the Beijing-based Global Bitcoin Summit is the latest in a long line of aggressive moves against the cryptocurrency.  That would certainly tie into the falling volume in bitcoin transactions. China currently makes up 7% of all bitcoin exchange volume. Exchange volume in China is apparently a little muddy, following allegations of faked volume figures by some Chinese exchanges.  Does this signal a failing enthusiasm for bitcoin? The community certainly seems to be trying to raise awareness, the way that many communities do when they want to bolster their message: sports.  One kickboxing event  was rapidly followed by another, and now, people are floating the idea of UFC sponsorships. Anything to get bitcoin into the spotlight.  China's role in bitcoin may be deflating by the day, but this is unlikely to affect transaction volumes in the long term, said Luria. “The success of bitcoin will happen regardless of China,” he argued.  “The impact is only a short-term trading impact. If there are disruptive businesses that emerge out of these technologies, then whether China participates is its own issue.""  Follow the numbers  China may have something to do with bitcoin’s price, but some people prefer not to look at the markets.  Walter Zimmerman is Chief Technical Analyst for United-ICAP, an energy trading advisory firm which also tracks bitcoin. He relies on chart data, rather than political and economic events, when it comes to developing trading strategies.  Zimmerman argues that we’re nearing the end of a downward price movement, which explains the volume drop-off:  “There should be a drop-off in volume in the latter stages of a falling wedge pattern.”  By relying on price movements for its intelligence, technical analysis hopes to be able to predict market movements more effectively.  This is a long-established method of market analysis, although fundamentals analysis and technical analysis are like competing religions in finance – followers of one discipline rarely have much time for the other.  The falling wedge is an inverse triangle, created as a price progressively falls. As they fall, prices bounce up and down, reaching upper and lower limits before reversing, but the general trend is downward.  The lower and upper lines bounding these limits are called support and resistance lines, respectively.  This chart (produced by CoinDesk but mirroring one provided by Zimmerman) shows this downward falling wedge starting around bitcoin’s height, just after December, and continuing until now.  Speaking to CoinDesk earlier in the week, Zimmerman said he thought bitcoin was about to break out of this cycle and embark on an upward trajectory.  “The price gets further away from the falling wedge support line and spends more time up against the falling wedge resistance line. Instead of bouncing up and down, the market becomes tracked to resistance,” he said, arguing that this is what has happened in the last half of April (see red bracket in our chart).  Challenges for technical analysis  Not everyone is a believer in technical analysis. Common criticisms are that you can draw the lines any way you like, and so fudge the picture to fit a theory, especially if you look at different time periods to find your trends (see the first comment in this thread on falling wedges in bitcoin).  However, Zimmerman maintains that it’s a solid theory, and said that he always looks across an asset’s entire history before plotting his lines.  The other worry about using technical analysis for bitcoin is that it isn’t a particularly liquid asset. Events like China’s cooling towards the currency, or Mt Gox’s collapse, naturally cause big fluctuations in price. Zimmerman claimed:  “I have no qualms with looking at relatively illiquid markets, because in a reversal of expectations I have found that time and again, it’s these quiet little markets that hardly anyone knows about – where the high frequency trading hasn’t penetrated yet – where you’re likely to find the most perfect technical patterns.”  Many readers will take umbrage at any description of bitcoin as a ""quiet little market"", but it is worth remembering its characteristics, which set it apart from many others.  In particular, it may be labelled a cryptocurrency, but for many people, it’s still an investment asset, and with the market falling, people may be holding bitcoins in the hope of a rally.  [post-quote]  The likelihood is that both China and market sentiment are contributing to the downturn in volume. That also suggests that it’ll be a temporary blot on the bitcoin landscape.  Statements in this article should not be considered investment advice, which is best sought directly from a qualified professional.

42425653,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIeq7h,1399808109,Why Bitcoin's Greatest Asset is its Community,"Nick Tomaino is currently on the business development team at Coinbase, and is also a first-year business school student at the Yale School of Management. Prior to that, he worked in venture capital, most recently for Softbank Capital.  While the protocol underpinning the network will always be key, an engaged community is more important to the future success of bitcoin than its underlying technology.  There is a large and rapidly growing community of developers, merchants, users, miners, and investors in the world that believe in democratizing the financial markets and making money accessible and easy-to-use for everyone the world over. People tend to underestimate this community.  Union Square Ventures  , one of the most successful venture capital firms of the past decade, is famous for its simple 140-character investment thesis:  “USV invests in: large networks of engaged users, differentiated through user experience, and defensible through network effects.”  USV has had tremendous success investing in networks of people that have specific expertise, creativity and passion, like Twitter, Tumblr, and Kickstarter. Particularly given the strong emotional aspects of money and the open-source nature of the bitcoin project, it is the expertise, creativity, and passion of the community that will ultimately determine bitcoin's future.  It is common for newcomers to bitcoin to say “I believe in digital currencies but I don’t think bitcoin will be the winner.” However, those people underestimate the power of the bitcoin community.  Developers  I haven't met anyone that personifies the ethos of the community better than Gavin Andresen. Andresen is a scientist and hacker who began working on bitcoin's open-source project in 2008.  Up until last month, Andresen was the lead developer for bitcoin and is still a very active contributor to the Bitcoin Core code. Andresen, along with Wladimir Van der Laan (who replaced Gavin as lead developer), Pieter Wuille, Greg Maxwell, and Jeff Garzik are the five core developers who actually accept code changes and apply them to the Github repository.  These five, along with thousands of others from across the world, spend their time maintaining and improving Bitcoin Core, which is only in version 0.9.1. The talented and rapidly growing developer community, led by Andresen and Van der Laan, is working hard to improve the code and there will be lots of future improvements to the five-year-old technology.  Merchants  Right now, bitcoin is more compelling for US merchants than US consumers because merchants are able to use bitcoin as a more efficient payment protocol without worrying about the volatility or tax implications associated with it.  Overstock.com  , Tiger Direct, CheapAir, and Fiverr are a few of the merchants using bitcoin. In total, there are currently over 60,000 merchants using bitcoin and that number is rapidly growing.  Users  People are generally emotional and naturally sceptical when it comes to money. So it should be no surprise that to date, the most widely discussed bitcoin users have been Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous bitcoin creator, and Dread Pirate Roberts, the anonymous founder of Silk Road – the online marketplace for illegal goods that the FBI shut down in October.  This mysterious 'Internet money' surely can’t be real money used by real, law abiding citizens for real purposes, right?  That assumption turns out to be wrong. Coinbase has over 1,200,000 consumer wallets held by people across the world that use bitcoin because it's a cheaper, faster, and safer way to send money and an attractive alternative way to store value.  The users I know use bitcoin not because they engage in illegal activities, dislike banks, and don’t trust government, but because they understand the benefits of the technology.  Miners  Miners are not widely talked about, but they are an essential part of the community because collectively they form the infrastructure that powers bitcoin's payment network.  The mining community is generally made of mining pools such as GHash.IO, Discus Guild and BTC Guild, and mining hardware manufacturers such as KNCMiner and Cointerra.  Blockchain has a chart on the distribution of hash rates in the network that is helpful in understanding the major players.  These mining pools are financially incentivized to uphold the security of the network and verify transactions. The hardware companies are dedicated to finding ways to mine more efficiently and they are an important player as the technology matures.  Investors  Venture Capitalists and institutional investors have increased their interest in bitcoin over the past year.  High profile Venture Capitalists like Fred Wilson and Marc Andreessen and investment managers like Bill Miller of Legg Mason and Mike Novogratz of Fortress have publicly spoken about investments in both bitcoin the digital currency and the bitcoin ecosystem.  Furthermore, Bloomberg recently announced that it is now offering price info and news on bitcoin to all of its users.  While the high-profile investors' involvement in bitcoin is not quite as important as the merchants, developers, users, and miners, their presence does lend credibility to the digital currency and is likely helping to accelerate adoption.

42425666,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIeqXh,1399804243,Ripple Explained: Medieval Banking with a Digital Twist,"Antony Lewis is Head of Business Development at itBit, a bitcoin exchange based in Singapore. In this article, he explains how Ripple works, so that anyone can understand it.  What is Ripple? Well, it is both a digital currency and a payments protocol, and it is the latter that has got people excited.  Ripple has been hitting the news recently, with banks saying it has promise, and even for the first time starting to use it for services. But many people don't understand it, so how does it work, exactly?  A good parallel is the hawala network – a traditional, non-digital way of sending money from city to city. Hawala has its roots in medieval Arabia, and is still in use today in places where banks won’t or can’t operate.  A medieval banking system  Hawala is best described as money transmission without money movement, providing the appearance of instant remittance between separate locations; for example, sending money between different cities or countries.  In the basic case, say Alex wants to send money to Beth:  Alex goes to his local hawala agent and gives him some cash and a password, which he and Beth share.  The agent telephones Beth's local agent and tells him to release funds to someone who can provide the password.  Beth walks in to her agent, says the password, and receives cash. Commissions can be taken from either or both agents.  Note that money has been transmitted from Alex to Beth, but the physical notes have not moved. We are left in a situation where Alex's agent owes Beth's agent money.  They can either settle the debt later, or hope that there may be reverse transactions if other clients want to move money in the opposite direction.  Also note that trust is involved. In this scenario, there are three trust relationships:  Alex has to trust that his agent will do the right thing, as he is handing over cash.  Beth has to trust that her agent will do the right thing, as she is expecting to receive cash.  The agents need to trust each other over the repayment of the debt (IOUs).  Moving to Ripple  Now we can have websites or shops that perform the function of agents, and instead of agents phoning each other, we can communicate the IOUs electronically.  This is how Ripple works: Alex logs on to his preferred Ripple gateway, deposits money to it, and instructs them to release funds to Beth via her gateway. Beth collects her funds.  You now understand Ripple. Simple eh?  Not just cash  In the example above, we talked about cash. Now this can also work with physical gold.  So long as both gateways are prepared to accept and hand out the precious metal, and the gateways have a trust relationship that allows the IOUs of gold (as opposed to IOUs of cash in the first example), the network still works, and you can transmit gold.  Alex gives gold, Beth receives gold, and Alex's agent owes Beth's agent gold.  You now understand that Ripple can work for gold, not just money.  Anything goes  Now replace the word 'gold' with 'anything'.  Now, you can transmit anything without moving it, so long as both gateways are set up to deal in it.  This works best for non-perishable, fungible goods (cash is good, gold is OK, as are cryptocurrencies, but can also be extended to beer and flowers, if the gateways want to deal in them.  You now understand that Ripple can transfer anything.  Conversion of goods  If either gateway is prepared to exchange cash with gold (ie: act as a gold trader, or 'market maker' in Ripple terminology), then Alex can put cash in at his gateway and Beth can get gold out at hers.  You now understand that Ripple can also morph stuff.  No direct trust? Find a chain  What if Alex's gateway doesn't have a trust relationship with Beth's gateway?  So long as there are intermediary gateways who can form a chain of trust for the object being passed (cash, or gold, or whatever), the transaction will work.  The Ripple algorithm tries to find the shortest trust path between the gateways. So, thinking back to hawala, Alex's agent may not trust Beth's agent, but there may be a third agent who trusts the other two. So there will be two IOUs: Alex's agent owes the third agent, who owes Beth's agent.  No chain of trust? Use ripples.  What if the network can’t find any chain of trust between the two gateways at all for the cash or goods in question?  This is where 'ripples' (XRP) come in. XRP is the 'currency of last resort' for the ripple network.  All gateways provide a price in XRP of anything they deal in (for example: a dollar is 200 XRP; 1 oz of gold might be 260,000 XRP).  You could say, USD is the currency of last resort in the USA – that is, everything has a price in USD.  This means, within the Ripple network, you can convert anything to a number of XRPs, transfer the XRPs via the trust chains, then convert back at the end gateway, if needed.  XRP is not just a currency of last resort  As well as being a 'bridging currency' or a 'currency of last resort', XRP also has other notable benefits.  Firstly, XRP as a currency settles immediately, so when it’s sent on the Ripple network, the ownership of the actual asset changes – so it’s final and trustless.  This is in contrast to IOUs, which, although transferred instantly, still need to be redeemed from a gateway. This gives rise to counterparty credit risk, as it needs you to trust that the gateway will fulfill its obligations.  Secondly, transfers of XRPs over ripple incur fewer and smaller transaction fees, as there are fewer intermediaries needed.  Who owes who?  Who is keeping track of all the IOUs? In the hawala system, each agent keeps their own ledger, and they are reconciled periodically within their network of trust.  In Ripple, a public ledger of accounts, balances, and IOUs are kept updated by everyone simultaneously in the Ripple network, which is a distributed collection of servers around the world.  The servers agree on changes by consensus (effectively: ""Do we all agree this transaction can take place?""). There is no central 'authority' who says yes or no to transactions, and anyone can be a server by running free software on their computer.  That’s just the beginning  There is more here, and as you dig, you'll learn about market makers, who provide prices at which they are prepared to trade between goods (for example, cash for gold, gold for silver, silver for XRP, XRP for GBP, and so on).  You'll start to understand why every transaction costs a small number of XRP (a 1/1000 of a cent, to stop transaction spam), and that the network is pre-lubricated with 100 billion XRPs.  You’ll discover the elegance of confirmation via consensus. You'll learn that transactions based on cryptography on a distributed network with public ledgers is faster, cheaper, lower risk, and much, much better in almost every way possible than centralised pre-Internet correspondent banking messaging networks such as SWIFT, that some financial institutions currently operate on. You'll learn much, much more.  This was a guest submission. We hope this has helped to you to understand the Ripple system.

42425668,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIeqZh,1399800811,Beijing Summit: What if They Had a Bitcoin Ban and No One Cared?,"If the recent issues surrounding bank account closures and domestic media warnings were supposed to scare Chinese attendees away from the two-day Global Bitcoin Summit starting in Beijing Saturday, someone forgot to tell everyone.  The main 400-seat auditorium was regularly full on the first day for the event's keynote speakers, which included Roger Ver, Aaron Koenig of the Global Bitcoin Alliance, and Wang Wei of the Chinese Museum of Finance.  The overall tone was not so much defiance, but apathy towards greater regulation.  While Bobby Lee of BTC China was noticeably absent from the day's lineup, attendees remained focused on the future and dedicated to the cause.  Both the size and mood of the crowd confirmed what several of CoinDesk's local Chinese sources have been saying for a while: the community at large is tired of hearing about banks vs. exchanges, and wants to keep building.  How exactly they plan to do this without fiat gateways will be a discussion point tomorrow and in the coming months.  China is big, in every sense  The huge China National Convention Center, located just across the road from Beijing's 2008 Olympic main stadium, also highlighted just how niche bitcoin still remains in the overall Chinese economy, which is still booming.  The bitcoin summit itself took up a relatively small space at the back of the second floor. Attendees passed massive franchising and marketing conventions, each with their own collection of booths and babes, before even seeing a bitcoin logo.  Regulation not an issue  Regulatory issues were barely touched upon, if mentioned at all, during Roger Ver's keynote. Stressing once again the utterly voluntary nature of the bitcoin economy, he told the audience his mission was now more that of a promoter of bitcoin's cause around the world.  ""I'm pretty much done investing in bitcoin startups. But if you know some good ones I'm always very happy to introduce you to the right people,"" he said, when asked if he intended to invest further in Chinese companies.  On the topic of which companies he predicted would succeed in future, Ver said ""it's still too early to tell"" – comparing the landscape to search engines in the late 1990s, when it was still unclear whether Lycos, Yahoo or Altavista would dominate in future years. He continued:  ""But somebody's going to work it out. Somebody's going to do it right.""  Chinese companies were continuing to do well, he added, ""I'm often more impressed with Chinese bitcoin exchanges than I am with some of the US and European exchanges.""  Harry Zhou, an Associate with White & Case LLP, gave another presentation on regulation-specific issues, but chose to speak generally instead of referring to current events directly.  Comparing the legal situation in China to that in the US, he drew key differences between each country's definition of 'legal tender', as well as the US's federal system and competing state jurisdictions.  In China, he said, the renminbi is the only legal tender and that is sacrosanct – even precious metals are not allowed. In the US, however, alternative local barter systems and gold and silver are tolerated even though the US dollar remained the only official legal tender.  Other features  Other international guests on the day's speaking agenda were Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin and Anthony di Iorio from the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada.  While some booths marked with exchange names (like CHBTC) were empty, other local startups filled the spaces. We saw secure wallet Bifubao, mining equipment maker Gridseed Technology Ltd, and even a couple of OKCoin-branded ATMs.  Representing the alt universe was Zetacoin, promoting its Swiss-built payment infrastructure designed for countries like Kenya.
