However, crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO believes a $1 XRP price is still possible in this cycle, as he predicted a price surge in the near term. From this analyst‚Äôs technical perspective, recent price action has seen XRP forming a ‚ÄúW‚Äù pattern, making it ready for a massive push above $1. XRP Price Pattern Signals A Potential Massive Move XRP‚Äôs highest price so far this year is $0.718. The cryptocurrency now finds itself perambulating below the $0.65 price level and even falling to as low as $0.57 in the past seven days. This has prompted many investors and holders to feel frustrated and concerned about the poor price performance. Related Reading: Crypto Outflows Reach New Record High, Will The Bitcoin Decline Continue? Despite this lackluster performance, many analysts continue to hold on to a bullish price action for XRP. EGRAG, who is well-known for his bullish attitude on XRP, has, for the most part, encouraged his followers on social media to maintain their positive posture on XRP. His most recent technical analysis, which he shared on social media, indicates that the price formation of XRP has now established a bullish pattern, which has been responsible for significant price increases in the past. This price spike is particularly based on a peculiar ‚ÄúW‚Äù pattern, which he highlighted on a 3-day candlestick chart of the XRP price. Interestingly, a detailed look into the chart shared by EGRAG shows that XRP embarked on the formation of this ‚ÄúW‚Äù pattern in July 2023. Now that the formation seems complete, the analyst noted that XRP could potentially surge to $1 on a standard scale and $1.2 on a logarithmic scale. #XRP Wave 10 ( $1 ‚Äì $1.2) üåäüîü: The 10th ‚ÄúW‚Äù Pattern is exceptionally well-aligned with the current market setup, signaling a potentially significant move. Target Prices Remain Consistent: 1) Non-Logarithmic: $1 2) Logarithmic: $1.2#XRPArmy STAY STEADY and Appreciate the‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/PS6xZi1FFv ‚Äî EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) March 24, 2024 At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.63. A surge to $1 and $1.2 from the current price level would mean a 58.7% and 90.47% spike respectively. However, EGRAG also noted the possibility of the ‚ÄúW‚Äù pattern leading to a downturn. In his price chart, he highlighted a worse case scenario of XRP falling to $0.44518. What‚Äôs Next For XRP? EGRAG is one of the many crypto analysts who are still ultra-bullish on XRP‚Äôs price trajectory. His long-term price projection for XRP is $27. Other analysts like Mikybull predict XRP can reach as high as $6. Related Reading: Bitcoin Held On Coinbase Exchange Reach 9-Year Low, Can Bitcoin Reach $75,000? Ripple‚Äôs lawsuit with the SEC seems to be nearing its end which could mean the end of a prolonged stunted price growth for XRP. As a result, we could see XRP surging to new highs very soon. Whether or not XRP reaches $27 or sets new records, many see it as an undervalued asset with significant upside potential.

Crypto Analyst Sees BTC Soaring Ahead Of 2024 Halving","As the crypto market braces for the upcoming Bitcoin (BTC) halving in April 2024, the discussion surrounding Bitcoin‚Äôs price trajectory has continued to gain momentum. Particularly, Micha√´l van de Poppe, a well-regarded figure in the crypto analysis domain, has shared his latest analysis on Bitcoin. Next Stop $80,000? In a post shared on X, Van de Poppe suggests that Bitcoin is on the cusp of a notable rise, eyeing a target range between $75,000 to $80,000 in the lead-up to the halving event. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs ‚ÄòNext Leg Higher Has Started,‚Äô Says Analyst: Reveals $100,000 Target On The Horizon This prediction is based on the current consolidation phase of Bitcoin, indicating a buildup toward testing its all-time high with the potential for a subsequent correction. #Bitcoin consolidating.

During that consolidation / correction phase, I expect altcoins to outperform. pic.twitter.com/bnQjYuIzrr ‚Äî Micha√´l van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) March 27, 2024 Notably, Bitcoin halving plays a crucial role in this scenario, serving as a pivotal event that historically influences Bitcoin‚Äôs market dynamics. The halving, scheduled to occur in April 2024, will see the reward for mining new blocks halved, thereby reducing the rate at which new BTC are created and entering the market. This event, occurring approximately every four years, is anticipated to create scarcity, pushing the demand and possibly the price higher than past patterns have suggested. Bullish On Bitcoin In addition to Van de Poppe‚Äôs predictions, other analysts have shared their optimistic outlooks regarding Bitcoin‚Äôs potential price movement. Jelle, another esteemed crypto analyst, posits that Bitcoin is poised for a significant leap, potentially breaching the $100,000 mark sooner than expected. This bullish sentiment is also echoed by Doctor Profit, who highlights the importance of understanding Bitcoin‚Äôs current market behavior, including its recent sideways movement. He identifies this movement as an accumulation phase poised to catalyze a surge past the $80,000 mark, aiming for $100,000. #Bitcoin ‚Äì What‚Äôs Next?

The U.S. Treasury Department‚Äôs Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) and the U.K.‚Äôs Office of Foreign Sanctions Implementation also issued sanctions against Gaza Now‚Äôs founder, Mustafa Ayash, as well as another person and two other entities they claim were working with Gaza Now on multiple fundraising efforts, listing several cryptocurrency addresses Ayash and Gaza Now used to raise funds.

But crypto made up only a small slice of its overall efforts: according to blockchain research firm Elliptic, the group only received $21,000 in crypto in the weeks after October 7.  The figure tracks with new research from another blockchain research firm, TRM Labs, which found that crypto-denominated fundraising for Hamas and other terrorist organizations, including ISIS, tends to be small in scale.  According to TRM‚Äôs 2023 Illicit Crypto Economy Report, three-quarters of terrorism-linked donations last year were under $500 ‚Äì and 40% were under $100.

USDe grew to $1.3 billion from $85 million at the start of this year, bolstered by its high yield and anticipation of the airdrop.  Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Ethena, which offers the $1.3 billion USDe token, unveiled plans Wednesday to debut its governance token by airdropping tokens to users on April 2, according to a blog post.  The protocol is set to airdrop 750 million ENA tokens, or 5% of the total supply. The campaign to earn ""shards,"" which qualify users for the token airdrop, will end on April 1. Those who unstake, unlock or sell all their USDe before this date will not be eligible for the airdrop.  Users will be able to claim tokens starting the next day, when ENA will be listed on centralized exchanges, per the blog post. After the airdrop, Ethena will start a campaign with new incentives for the next phase of the airdrop.  Ethena's USDe token, often referred to as ""synthetic dollar,"" offers steady yields to investors by using ether {{ETH}} liquid staking tokens such as Lido's stETH as backing assets, pairing them with an equal value of short ETH perpetual futures position on derivatives exchanges to keep a ""rough target"" of $1 price. This is also known as a ""cash and carry"" trade, which harvests derivatives funding rates for a yield.

Ondo Finance's $95 million transfer bolstered BUIDL's growth.  U.S. Treasuries are a gateway for real-world asset tokenization efforts, as crypto firms and global financial heavyweights race to put traditional instruments such as bonds on blockchain rails.  BlackRock's first tokenized asset fund is off to a strong start, garnering a significant market share of the blockchain-based tokenized U.S. Treasury market just a week following its debut.  Blockchain data shows that BlackRock's BUIDL raked in $245 million of deposits as of Wednesday. Its strong introduction propelled the fund into second place among peers, trailing only Franklin Templeton's Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX), which has $360 million of deposits, according to rwa.xyz data.  BlackRock was the latest high-profile entrant to crypto's tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) boom, with digital asset firms and global banks such as HSBC, JPMorgan and Citigroup exploring ways to use blockchain technology for traditional financial instruments such as bonds, credit, gold or even diamonds in pursuit of faster settlements and increased efficiency.  U.S. Treasuries are a gateway for tokenization efforts as a low-risk, well-known instrument where investors can park their on-chain cash and earn stable yield without leaving the blockchain ecosystem.

Asked Wednesday on Fox Business whether BlackRock ‚Äì which has made waves in crypto through its bitcoin exchange-traded fund introduced earlier this year ‚Äì could still list an ETF that holds Ethereum's ether if the crypto is a security, he replied, ""I think so.""  The SEC is reportedly taking a look at the question of whether ether is a security. Fortune reported earlier this month that the regulator is seeking to classify ether as one and has sent subpoenas to several companies as part of that inquiry.  This caused concern over whether this would mean an ether ETF would even be possible in the U.S.  Read more: Ether Tumbles 6% as ETH ETF Hopes Dim Amid Regulatory Probe Reports  But Fink's confidence is a striking note of optimism.  Eight potential issuers, including BlackRock, have submitted filings with the SEC to bring a spot ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) to the market. The final decision by the regulator is due in May, with industry experts predicting that applications won't get approved, regardless of what the SEC finds the nature of ether to be.  BlackRock is also one of the now-11 issuers of spot bitcoin ETFs. The asset management giant's fund, the iShares Bitcoin Fund (IBIT), is by far the most successful spot bitcoin fund after collecting more than $15 billion in assets after only 2 1/2 months. IBIT is the ""fastest growing ETF in the history of ETFs,"" Fink said on Fox Business.  ""Look, I'm very bullish on the long-term viability of bitcoin,"" he said. ""We're creating now a market that has more liquidity, more transparency, and I'm pleasantly surprised, and I would never have predicted that before.""  When asked if an ether fund was next, Fink said ""we'll see.""",POSITIVE,ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/03/27/blackrocks-fink-not-concerned-about-possibility-of-sec-designating-eth-a-security,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4b06d0b11377a5d28ee1092f40e9218ac68bddc2-6263x3523.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This action has sparked the curiosity of those in the community about the reason for these transactions. Bitcoin Whale Moves $6 Billion In BTC Blockchain analysis platform Arkham Intelligence first brought this occurrence to the community‚Äôs attention when it mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the Bitcoin address (37XuVSE) had moved over $6 billion in BTC to three new addresses. Related Reading: Ripple CEO Responds To SEC‚Äôs Shocking $2 Billion Demand As part of the transactions, $5.03 billion worth of BTC was sent to one of these addresses (bc1q8yj), while the two other addresses (bc1q6m5 and bc1q592) received $561.46 million and $488.40 million worth of BTC respectively. Arkham added that one of the wallets (bc1q592) has since then proceeded to transfer the received funds to another wallet. Notably, the wallet which moved $6 billion in BTC was before now the fifth richest Bitcoin address having held over 94,500 BTC in its wallet. As of now, it still holds 1.31 BTC in the wallet in question. Interestingly, before now, this address was dormant as it had not moved any of this BTC which it received since 2019. Transactions of such magnitude are always sure to cause a stir in the crypto community, considering the impact such whales can have on the market. Usually, a move like this can cause community members to speculate that the whale may be looking to offload their tokens and take profits. However, the fact that these transactions weren‚Äôt made to exchange-linked wallets has quelled such speculations. Another BTC Whale On The Rise Bitcoinist recently reported on BlackRock‚Äôs Bitcoin wallet, which has continued to accumulate Bitcoin at an astonishing rate due to the impressive demand for its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Despite just launching this ETF in mid-January 2024, BlackRock now holds 243,126 BTC for the fund. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP Price Will Rally 800% To $6, Here‚Äôs When BlackRock‚Äôs BTC holdings has seen it rise to becoming one of the largest corporate BTC holders, only behind centralized exchanges Binance, Bitfinex, and Coinbase and fellow Bitcoin ETF issuer Grayscale. A sustained demand for the IBIT ETF could however see BlackRock surpass these entities at some point. That is also something that could reflect positively on Bitcoin‚Äôs price seeing as how instituitional demand for the flagship crypto has helped propel it to new highs.

42391068,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69beUemr,1711567818,What Binance's Exit From Nigeria Means for P2P Bitcoin,"Some Nigerians were shocked when crypto exchange Binance announced they would discontinue all services in Nigeria by March 8. Despite facing scrutiny from regulators before the announcement, many people still asked how the biggest exchange in crypto could just disappear from the world‚Äôs fastest growing market for bitcoin adoption. I wasn‚Äôt shocked because I‚Äôve been predicting this for years. Entrepreneurs in the Global South are under attack and the frontline is a currency war being played out right before our eyes.  This feature is part of CoinDesk‚Äôs ‚ÄúFuture of Bitcoin‚Äù package published to coincide with the 4th Bitcoin ‚Äúhalving‚Äù in April 2024. Ray Youssef CEO of NoOnes.  I founded NoOnes, a peer-to-peer bitcoin trading platform based in the Global South, because I foresaw the problems facing the crypto industry. Three years ago, I saw this day coming. I knew it was coming because I was the CEO of a Bitcoin company based in the United States, and I saw the financial apartheid and all the regulatory problems up close. American regulators hold Africans in such low regard they make rules to suit Westerners and don‚Äôt care too much about anyone else. I knew it would be more and more difficult to serve Africans and the rest of the Global South if my company was based in the U.S.  My only option was to turn my back on my previous business, Paxful, which I had built into a Bitcoin P2P platform with over 10 million users. The problems I saw back then are exploding right now, but blaming governments alone is not the path forward. We must understand the pressures our leaders are under because only when we do that can we come to the table with them to forge a new path ahead. Right now, all we have is a bunch of people cursing each other and that is not the way forward.  See also: As Bitcoin Platform Paxful Closes, Co-Founder Youssef Talks Alternatives  This war is about the financial system and the power to control the levers that decide whose money is good and whose money is bad. Entrepreneurs in the Global South are trapped in their own markets, so that even making payments or doing business with countries next door is difficult. For the average African entrepreneur to scale any business by expanding outside the African continent, it is basically impossible. And now that Binance has left Nigeria, some businesses based here are wondering what‚Äôs next.  To be able to truly unlock the potential for Global South entrepreneurs to create value, we have to nurture them and create an environment that allows them to flourish. That‚Äôs only possible if we do what I‚Äôve been advocating for years: ensure there is free trade by having a free-flowing money system. Making it happen is not going to be easy.  Binance was forced to leave Nigeria, and I‚Äôm sure it will happen to other crypto companies in other countries. It‚Äôs almost impossible to run a crypto business or a bitcoin marketplace serving Africa from another continent because you have to be on the ground to see the problems and find the solutions. I knew we couldn‚Äôt achieve our mission to help the unbanked if we didn‚Äôt have boots on the ground in the Global South, and that‚Äôs why we based NoOnes here right from the start.  See also: Is Nigeria Strong-Arming Binance? | Opinion  I‚Äôm not some mad guy who gave eight years of my life to a company and then left on a whim. I know Nigeria and I know the Global South because my businesses have been active here for years. We live and work here now, and we listen to what people on the ground tell us. We hired local employees to handle moderation for Africans, for example, and that‚Äôs partly what ‚Äúboots on the ground‚Äù means.  We are not looking at Africa ‚Äî or any of the Global South where we operate ‚Äî as a quick win. It‚Äôs about establishing long-term collaboration based on respect and equity. I‚Äôve met thousands of tech-savvy Nigerian entrepreneurs and I know there is a reason for the high-level of bitcoin adoption here. For too long they have been stunted by an unfair global financial system, by financial apartheid that creates money prisons and stifles economic growth.  Bitcoin gives those entrepreneurs the opportunity to show what they can do when markets are free and money is allowed to flow. All they need to grow is a level playing field. They just need a shot, a path towards success, a window of opportunity. Our next step is to make it easier for other entrepreneurs to take their business to the next level. Despite the withdrawal of Binance Nigeria, tons of opportunities remain. The battles we have to fight might be tough, but the opportunities on the fastest growing continent on the planet are worth it.

Last week, Coinbase had to update its official status page to warn that ""Base mainnet is experiencing high traffic and increasing fees."" It was quite a letdown, with Jesse Pollak, Coinbase's head of protocols, who leads the Base project, telling CoinDesk recently that Ethereum's landmark Dencun upgrade would bring ""sub-cent"" transactions closer to reality.  On Monday, Pollak tweeted that ""lower fees induced >5x more demand,"" so ""fees are rising,"" and he outlined a plan to increase capacity by roughly 400 times. ""We know high fees suck ‚Äì and getting them lower is our top priority.""  What doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon is meme coin trading. ""It‚Äôs evident now that meme coins have evolved from just a cultural movement into a key tool for driving the adoption of new chains,"" the website Coingecko wrote in a newsletter.  Where Solana was jammed up by dog- and sloth-themed tokens, one of the hottest meme coins on Base appears to be BRETT ‚Äì inspired by a cartoon character drawn by the artist Matt Furie, who bequeathed Pepe the Frog to the world before it quickly became adopted as a mascot for the alt-right and repurposed into all sorts of ridiculous incarnations. According to the website Fantagraphics, Brett is one of Pepe's ""slacker roommates"" from the Boy's Club cartoon series, featuring a ""series of comical vignettes combining laconic psychedelia, childlike enchantment, drug-fueled hedonism and impish mischief."" Sometimes he's referred to as ""blue Pepe"" or ""Blepe.""  Screenshot of the @BasedBrett profile on the social media platform X. (@BasedBrett/X)  The smart contract underlying the BRETT token is available for anyone to read on the Base blockchain explorer, and according to an ""info"" section on the page, Brett is a toad, but The Protocol was unable to easily corroborate this taxonomic classification.  The coin has its own account on X, @BasedBrett, and a feed filled with, well, lots of memes. In one video, a character with the face of Brett sports a baseball hat that reads, ""MAKE MEMECOINS BASED AGAIN."" In another, Brett is touching the hand of God, Michelangelo-style. There is a yet another video purporting to show an actual airplane flying above Amsterdam, dragging a banner that reads ""BRETT - #1 MEME ON COINBASE.""  CAPTION: OK, this kind of actually looks like it might be real if you watch the actual video. (@BasedBrett/X)  At one point BRETT had a market capitalization of nearly $500 million, according to CoinMarketCap. Even price-charting analysts got in on the action, with one of them posting a technical analysis comparing the relative value of BRETT vs. a popular Solana-based token dogwifhat, ticker WIF, literally just representing an image of a dog wearing a hat.  The Protocol emailed Pollak for comment on whether the meme coin frenzy was welcome or unwelcome on Base, and whether the situation might cause any regulatory concerns for Coinbase.  He looped in a spokesperson for the crypto exchange, who responded with an emailed statement: ""Base‚Äôs mission is to bring the next billion users onchain, and we are encouraged by the recent influx of activity on Base. While we do not endorse specific assets, we are supportive of builders entering the Base ecosystem, and we are continuing to focus on making onchain technology more accessible with faster and cheaper transactions.""  ALSO:  Munchables, a Web3 project on the much-hyped Blast blockchain, suffered a hack that resulted in a loss of $62.5 million worth of ether (ETH). The attacker manipulated a contract and transferred stored user funds before upgrading the platform‚Äôs smart contracts. Blockchain sleuth ZachXBT said the attacker was likely North Korean ‚Äì with a profile listed on the open-source software development platform GitHub as ‚ÄúWerewolves0493,‚Äù allegedly working for the Munchables team. Later, the Munchables account said on X that a developer had ""shared all private keys involved, to assist in recovering the user funds."" The project set up a ""compensatory treasury pool"" where users could claim refunds. Blast suffered its first exploit in February, when a project team supposedly building atop the network disappeared after raising 420 ETH worth about $1.3 million at the time.  The security council serving as overseer of emergency upgrades on the layer-2 network Polygon zkEVM reportedly sprung into action to help address technical issues after a 10-hour outage.  Ethereum in the headlines:  The Ethereum Foundation, which supports and helps to coordinate development on the Ethereum blockchain, wrote on GitHub that ""we have received a voluntary enquiry from a state authority."" The disclosure dovetailed with speculation that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, under Chair Gary Gensler, is mounting a fresh push to classify Ethereum's native cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), as a security.  Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin said onstage at BUIDL Asia conference in Seoul that the ""metaverse is poorly defined and often seen more as a brand name than a product.""  A group of Ethereum core developers launched a web campaign to increase the network's gas limit, a move to increase throughput, CryptoBriefing reported. (In January, Buterin signaled support for such a move.)  Ethereum developers agreed to include, in the next major network upgrade known as ""Pectra,"" a proposal to dramatically increase the maximum validator stake to 2,048 from the current 32, The Block reported. The increase would allow large operators to stake ETH in large quantities without constantly having to spin up additional validators. (The increasingly sprawling number of validators has fueled concerns about network latency, as discussed in The Protocol last September.)

But a new report from the crypto investment firm Exponential.fi included a chart on these yields, and it caught our eye because they've been rising fast recently, pushing above 15%. Co-founder Mehdi Lebbar attributes the rising yields to higher demand from users, in part a reflection of the trend toward greater interoperability between blockchains, along with the proliferation of layer-2 and layer-3 networks. ""As the DeFi ecosystem extends across networks, third-party bridging protocols like Across and Synapse are reaping higher fees,"" the report reads. These yields are paid out to liquidity providers who supply the bridges with cryptocurrencies, according to Lebbar: ""The bridge allows transfers of bitcoins across chains, and people pay commissions on that. Commissions are reversed by the bridge/protocol to liquidity providers."" Asked if the higher yields might reflect increased risk, Lebbar said: ""The increased yield would reflect 'protocol risk' if we were in a mature, highly efficient market, but that‚Äôs not the case for bridging.""

42391082,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69beUfmP,1711567055,"Crypto Stocks Like MicroStrategy, Coinbase Could Shoot Up if Short Sellers Exit","MicroStrategy (MSTR) and Coinbase (COIN) have the most possibility of a short squeeze ‚Äì or a rally spurred by short sellers getting out of their bearish bets ‚Äì S3 Partners said in a report.  The total short interest in crypto stocks is $10.7 billion, with MicroStrategy and Coinbase making up 84% of these bearish bets, the report added.  The short sellers are piling into the crypto-linked stocks, wagering that they are primed to reverse their year-to-date jump in prices.  However, the trade has become so crowded that it primed these stocks for a short squeeze, said data analytics firm S3 Partners in a report on Monday. A short squeeze is triggered when an unexpected rally in a stock price forces short sellers to unwind their bearish bets, leading to an even bigger jump.  Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy (MSTR) and crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) are the top two crypto stocks with the highest ""squeeze score,"" S3's Managing Director, Ihor Dusaniwsky, said in the report.  ""These crypto related stocks are extremely crowded and very squeezable relative to the U.S. market, with an average Crowded score of 57.34 versus the street average of 32.41 and an average Squeeze score of 78.69 versus the street average of 34.41,"" the report said, adding that ""MSTR, COIN and CLSK are the most squeezable names in the sector.""  The total short interest in crypto stocks is $10.7 billion, with MicroStrategy and Coinbase making up 84% of these bearish bets in the sector, Dusaniwsky said in the report. The short interest in the crypto industry is so crowded that it has eclipsed the short bets of the average U.S. stock ‚Äì over three times larger, the report added. Other crypto-linked stocks that have high short interest include bitcoin miners Marathon Digital (MARA), Riot Platforms (RIOT) and CleanSpark (CLSK).  The explanation could be that some traders are going long bitcoin {{BTC}} but hedging that position by going short related stocks. In fact, ""long bitcoin and short miners"" was a trade that market participants cited as one of the reasons why mining stocks have underperformed bitcoin.  However, the crypto stocks, specifically MicroStrategy and Coinbase, have defied the bearish thesis and enjoyed sizeable gains this year as the price of bitcoin reached an all-time high. MSTR has risen 179% this year and COIN has climbed 52%, while bitcoin has jumped 64%.  The persistent rally in bitcoin and the crypto stocks has taken some toll on the bearish bets. At the time of the report, S3 has observed that short sellers of crypto stocks have incurred $4 billion in losses month-to-date, with MicroStrategy leading the pack.  If a sector becomes too crowded with short sellers, such a trade can become dangerous if the share price of a shorted stock continues to climb, forcing investors to scramble to cover their shorts, leading to massive losses. In recent years, short squeezes in GameStop (GME) and Tesla (TSLA) led to disaster for short sellers.  The S3 report also echoed the sentiment, cautioning against doubling down on a crowded trade. ""Crypto stock short sellers have been selling into a rallying market ‚Äì either looking for a pullback in the Bitcoin rally or using the short positions as a hedge versus actual Bitcoin holdings. For the trades that are risk positions, there is a strong squeeze possibility in the more unprofitable shorts in the sector like MSTR, COIN and CLSK,"" the report said.  ""If the short exposure is a Bitcoin hedge, then short interest should remain relatively flat, regardless of the Bitcoin rally,"" Dusaniwsky concluded.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/03/27/crypto-stocks-like-microstrategy-coinbase-could-shoot-up-if-short-sellers-exit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4aa9f43a1dc4395bf6d9ddbfad38047db8a4325e-1166x656.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

24875299,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=600004,1711564226,"Bitcoin ‚ÄúLiquid Inventory Ratio‚Äù Hits All-Time Low, What It Means","On-chain data shows the Bitcoin ‚ÄúLiquid Inventory Ratio‚Äù has dropped to an all-time low. Here‚Äôs what this could mean for the asset. Bitcoin Sell Side Liquidity Is Low Relative To Demand Right Now In a post on X, CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju discussed the recent trend in the Liquid Inventory Ratio for Bitcoin. The Liquid Inventory Ratio is an on-chain indicator that tells us about how the total sell-side liquidity inventory of the asset compares against its demand. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Returns To Extreme Greed As BTC Breaks $71,000 The sell-side liquidity inventory of the asset is gauged using four factors: the total exchange reserve, miner holdings, OTC desk holdings, and US government-seized BTC. Out of these, the exchange reserve (that is, the total amount sitting in the wallets of centralized exchanges) is the largest potential source of sell-side liquidity. The chart on the right below shows how the sell-side liquidity inventory of the coin has changed over the last few years: The value of the metric appears to have been going down in recent years | Source: ki_young_ju on X From the graph, it‚Äôs visible that the sell-side liquidity of the cryptocurrency has been heading down for a while now. This decline is mostly driven by the depletion of exchange reserves, as investors have been continuously pushing towards self-custody, possibly preferring to hold onto their Bitcoin for extended periods. The chart on the left displays the trend in the total demand for the asset. Here, the demand is measured using the 30-day balance changes of ‚Äúaccumulation addresses.‚Äù The accumulation addresses are those that have a history of only buying BTC and no history of selling. Exchanges and miner entities are excluded from this cohort, of course, as they count under the sell-side liquidity instead, regardless of whether they satisfy the condition for accumulation addresses or not. Clearly, the demand for Bitcoin has exploded recently as new players like exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have entered into the arena. All this BTC is potentially going out of circulation and being locked into the wallets known for hosting a one-way traffic. Given these two developments in the sell-side liquidity inventory and demand, it‚Äôs not surprising to see that the Liquid Inventory Ratio, which measures the ratio between the two, has plunged recently. The trend in the Liquid Inventory Ratio for the asset over the past few years | Source: ki_young_ju on X Following the latest decline in the indicator, its value has, in fact, dropped to a new all-time low. This means that the sell-side liquidity has never been this low when compared to the demand for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Returns To Neutral: Buying Push Already Over? Given this trend, it will be interesting to see how the BTC rally plays out from here, as the supply available to buy is only continuing to tighten.

The consequences of the trial could have wider implications on how developers of open-source projects are treated.  Tornado Cash Developer Alexey Pertsev should be jailed for 64 months, prosecutors told the judge in his trial in the Netherlands for money laundering, members of the prosecuting team told CoinDesk.  The two-day trial, which could have implications on how developers are treated in courts elsewhere, was held in the 'S-Hertogenbosch court on Tuesday and Wednesday.  The judge will deliver the verdict on May 14, the court said.  Pertsev has been accused of laundering $1.2 billion worth of crypto through the anonymizing tool Tornado Cash, the Dutch prosecutors detailed in an indictment that was shared ahead of the trial. The indictment said that between July 9, 2019 and Aug. 10, 2022 Pertsev made ""a habit of committing money laundering.""

42391074,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69beUfCV,1711562052,Ondo Finance to Move $95M to BlackRock's Tokenized Fund for Instant Settlements for Its T-Bill Token,"Ondo Finance is shifting backing assets of its OUSG token to BlackRock's BUIDL tokenized fund from a less desirable short-term Treasury bond ETF.  OUSG ""will become significantly more usable"" with instant, around-the-clock subscriptions and redemptions, Ondo Finance CEO said.  Tokenized real-world asset (RWA) platform Ondo Finance is moving $95 million of assets to BlackRock's brand-new tokenized fund BUIDL to allow instant settlements for its own U.S. Treasury-backed token (OUSG), Nathan Allman, CEO of Ondo Finance, said Wednesday in a Telegram interview with CoinDesk.  Until now, Ondo's OUSG token was backed by BlackRock's iShares Short Treasury Bond exchange-traded fund (ETF), which traded only during traditional market hours, opposite to crypto's around-the-clock nature. The allocation allows Ondo to significantly speed up subscription and redemption time to instant settlement at any day from the T+2 days, an Ondo blog post read.  ""Many investors have been so far hesitant to use OUSG because of the time it used to take to redeem, and given the 24/7/365 and volatile nature of crypto markets and the often sudden need for capital that arises from that,"" Allman said in the interview. ""OUSG will become significantly more usable as a store-of-value and collateral asset within the crypto ecosystem.""  Ondo has already transferred $15 million of OUSG backing assets to BlackRock's BUIDL over the past days, and plans to move another $80 million by the end of Wednesday, Allman added. Blockchain data shows that someone minted $79.3 million of BUIDL tokens at 18:49 UTC, which Allman confirmed it was Ondo.  Ondo's action marks the first example of a crypto protocol leveraging asset management giant BlackRock's tokenized fund offering, which debuted last week.

42391075,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69beUfMl,1711561627,The Munchables Hack Is Way Worse Than It Seems,"On Tuesday, March 26, Ethereum-based NFT-based ‚ÄúGameFi‚Äù project Munchables reported a hack that drained over 17,400 ETH (roughly $63 million) from its coffers. Within five hours of investigation, it became clear that the attack came from inside the house: a hired developer going by the alias ‚ÄúWerewolves0943‚Äù had drained the funds. Insiders stealing project funds is common enough in crypto that the term ‚Äúrugpull‚Äù is common parlance ‚Äî but what was unique about this situation is that the hired hands allegedly had ties to North Korea.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  After an hour of negotiations led by Munchables, along with independent blockchain investigator ZachXBT and security firm PeckShield, Werewolves0943 was convinced to return all the funds. ‚ÄúThe Munchables developer has shared all private keys involved to assist in recovering the user funds. Specifically, the key which holds $62,535,441.24 USD, the key which holds 73 WETH, and the owner key which contains the rest of the funds,‚Äù the Munchables‚Äô team posted at 4:40 a.m. UTC.  While that seems like a happy enough resolution of a relatively low-value hack, the Munchables exploit may have a longtail of bad outcomes for the crypto industry. Most importantly, while it isn‚Äôt yet confirmed that North Korea was hands down involved in the attack, the sheer fact so many people were willing to accept that at face value helps to further a dangerous narrative that crypto is helping to erode national defense and bolster terrorist organizations.  Data from 2016 to 2023 collected by on-chain analysis firm Chainalysis showed that North Korea hacked at least 20 crypto platforms stealing slightly over $1 billion worth of assets last year alone. A separate report by TRM Labs largely substantiated those findings. ‚ÄúNorth Korea-linked hacks have been on the rise over the past few years, with cyber-espionage groups such as Kimsuky and Lazarus Group utilizing various malicious tactics to acquire large amounts of crypto assets,‚Äù Chainalysis said in its report.  Earlier research found North Korea-affiliated hackers were using billions of dollars worth of stolen crypto loot to fund the Hermit Kingdom‚Äôs nuclear weapons program. These attacks were a substantial reason why the U.S. Treasury Department took the unprecedented move to sanction the Tornado Cash crypto mixer smart contract and why Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) can in good faith call crypto a ‚Äúnational security risk.‚Äù  ‚ÄúReal talk: the greatest policy threat to crypto by far is the allegation that North Korea funds its missile program by hacking smart contracts,‚Äù Variant Fund CEO Jake Chervinsky wrote on X. If crypto is banned, ‚ÄúIt will be caused by an increasingly common view among anti-crypto policymakers that crypto doesn't have a use case other than gambling and crime, and that the risk of allowing crypto to continue to exist far outweighs the potential benefits that blockchain developers have promised but not delivered for years.‚Äù  The Munchables attack only adds to this image. In fact, it‚Äôs slightly worse in that this wasn‚Äôt an outside actor exploiting poorly written code, but a complete failure of due diligence on part of a multi-million dollar blockchain project when hiring developers. It puts a whole new spin on the idea of ‚Äúsocial engineering‚Äù when apparent threat actors can not only manipulate an insider for critical information, but be paid to be on the inside.  According to Ethereum developer 0xQuit, the Munchables attack had been planned from the outset. The attacker was able to upgrade the ‚Äúlock contract,‚Äù meant to keep the project‚Äôs funds under lock and key for a specific period of time, so he could ‚Äúassign himself a deposited balance of 1,000,000 ether‚Äù while also hiding evidence of the changes, 0xQuit claimed.  See also: Calling a Hack an Exploit Minimizes Human Error | Opinion  Of course, this isn‚Äôt an issue for the crypto industry alone: For years, the Federal Bureau of Investigations and Republic of Korea have been issuing warnings as to North Korean ‚Äútradecraft‚Äù of exploiters gaining access to key infrastructure through employment. ‚ÄúThe hiring or supporting of DPRK IT workers continues to pose many risks, ranging from theft of intellectual property, data, and funds, to reputational harm and legal consequences,‚Äù the agencies wrote in a recent public service announcement.  Roll back  Apart from the embarrassment of having at least one North Korean hacker working on the inside of projects they intend to rob, the crypto community‚Äôs response to the Munchables attack also laid bare exactly how vulnerable these systems are. For instance, several people on Crypto Twitter suggested that, because Munichables was on the controversial Blast blockchain, which is maintained essentially by a simple multi-sig wallet, that the Blast team could intervene by rolling back the chain to recover the stolen funds.  ‚ÄúWhile I‚Äôm strongly against this action on any other chain, I don‚Äôt take Blast as a brand of ‚Äòserious decentralization chain‚Äô but instead as a place for games, experiments, degenry, etc.,‚Äù Adam Cochran, an influential voice in Ethereum circles and Cinneamhain Ventures partner, said in support of the potential rollback.  No doubt, Blast is a controversial network ‚Äî one that raised over one billion dollars without even a prototype ‚Äî but it is not at all that different from the way other OP Stack layer 2s are built. For instance, after Eric Wall reminded his followers that Blast and Coinbase‚Äôs Base network essentially run the same codebase, Base‚Äôs principle developer Jesse Pollack tweeted that Base‚Äôs ‚Äúkeys are not controlled by any one party or entity.‚Äù Instead, Base is controlled by a 2/2 multi-sig wallet, which theoretically could also rollback the chain if both parties agreed.

In a certain sense, as Chervinsky notes, many policymakers who ‚Äúunderstand the difference between centralized and decentralized technology‚Äù would choose the former because it means founders remain in control of what happens on-chain.  ‚ÄúBut ultimately, the burden is on the builders in the industry to do better,‚Äù he added.",NEGATIVE,ETH,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | REGULATION | ZRX,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/03/27/the-munchables-hack-is-way-worse-than-it-seems,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c8cc036fe07dba44de4500559659915478866b4f-2920x1642.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The layer 2 blockchain said users can lock their MNT into a vault and accumulate rewards.  Mantle, the layer 2 scalability solution built atop Ethereum, witnessed its native token surge to a fresh all-time high on Wednesday, pushing its market value to over $4 billion, outperforming the rest of the market.  MNT jumped to a high of $1.45 from a 24-hour low of $0.90. Mantle announced on X (formerly Twitter) that its ‚ÄòMantle Rewards Station‚Äô is now live. This means that users can connect their wallets and lock their MNT into a vault accumulating rewards.  The rewards are fully backed by Mantle‚Äôs Treasury, according to a blogpost. They will be distributed in the form of a receipt token called ‚ÄòmShard.‚Äô MNT stakers will be able to claim the mShards daily during the locking period (which ends on April 25) by redeeming Ethena Lab‚Äôs native token ENA in exchange. There are currently 2.5 billion Ethena Shards estimated to be worth $1.8 million.  Ethena Labs is a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum.  MNT holders already could start locking their tokens from March 25, but the rewards began to be counted officially on Wednesday.  According to Strahinja Savic, head of data and analytics at FRNT Financial, investors might view exposure to layer 2 solutions like Mantle as the potential for higher upside due to their newness.  ‚ÄúGiven how crucial layer-2s are to Ethereum, it's not surprising to see layer-2s have these explosive rallies,‚Äù said Savic. ‚ÄúGiven the relative newness of layer-2s compared to the layer-1 Etheruem network, investors may see greater upside in these tokens compared to ETH.‚Äù  South Korean crypto exchange Upbit also announced that it will list Mantle MNT‚Äôs trading pair with KRW, BTC and USDT.

24872742,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=600019,1711558836,Here‚Äôs Why The Cardano Price Is Struggling Below $0.7,"A plausible explanation has emerged for why the Cardano (ADA) price has dropped below the psychological price level of $0.7. The crypto token saw a sharp correction from its monthly peak of $0.8, recorded on March 14, and has since failed to recover such a height. Cardano Whales Responsible For Price Decline Data from the crypto analytics platform Santiment shows that the whale transaction count ($100,000 and above) on the network has reduced since March 14. That period was when Cardano hit a high of $0.8, which suggests that ADA whales began to take profits from then and have slowly exited their positions since then. Related Reading: Bitcoin Held On Coinbase Exchange Reach 9-Year Low, Can Bitcoin Reach $75,000? Crypto whales are known to have a massive impact on the market, and prices usually drop as soon as these traders begin to offload their holdings. Moreover, this wave of profit-taking isn‚Äôt peculiar only to the ADA ecosystem; these past few weeks have been marred by investors taking profits from different crypto tokens in which they were invested. The flagship crypto, Bitcoin, was also not spared. Investors decided to take profits after weeks of seeing BTC make a parabolic run on its way to a new all-time high (ATH) of $73,750. Meanwhile, long-term ADA holders also looked to have used the opportunity to take some profits, as data from Santiment shows that a considerable amount of dormant ADA tokens were also transacted during that period. Specifically, March 20 was a busy day for these long-term holders as 200 million ADA tokens (which had been dormant for a year) moved on that day. Time For ADA To Run To $1 Like the broader crypto market, Cardano looks to be recovering from this recent wave of profit-taking, although at a slower pace. For its next leg up, there is the belief that the crypto token could finally break the $1 resistance. Crypto analyst Dan Gambardello recently predicted that ADA could rise to between $1.4 and $1.5 if it can break out from the $0.8 price range. Related Reading: Ripple CEO Responds To SEC‚Äôs Shocking $2 Billion Demand ADA whales are likely to soon return to the fold with whale transctions higher than $100,00 expected to pick up soon enough. A spike in these trasaction count would suggest that these investors are taking advantage of ADA‚Äôs current decline to accumulate more of the crypto token. That is something that could contribute to a rise in ADA‚Äôs price depending on how bullish these investors are on ADA going forward. At the time of writing, ADA is trading at around $0.6513, down almost 4% in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The investment, which brings MyShell's total funding to $16.6 million, was led by Dragonfly, with additional participation from Delphi Ventures, Bankless Ventures, Maven11 Capital, Nascent, Nomad Capital and OKX Ventures. The round also attracted support from individual investors such as crypto investor and thought leader Balaji Srinivasan, NEAR's Illia Polosukhin and Paradigm's Casey K. Caruso.  MyShell pitches itself as an ecosystem for AI creators to develop and deploy applications. The new funds will be used to further the development of its open-source foundational model and to support its community ""of over 1 million registered users and 50,000 creators,"" according to a statement.  MyShell aims to distinguish itself from other AI platforms with its focus on decentralization: The company has open-sourced key parts of its codebase and leans on blockchain tools to assist with model training and creator royalties.  Crypto will ""uniquely enable"" MyShell to ""help creators and AI model researchers to monetize their work,"" and blockchains will serve as the foundation for ""a dedicated platform to trade, and own AI assets,"" MyShell CEO Ethan Sun told CoinDesk in an email.  The company's main products include ‚ÄúWorkshop,‚Äù where users can build AI agents through prompts, and ‚ÄúMakerspace,‚Äù a no-code app development tool for creators. The tools have mainly gained steam in the realm of AI companions, with people utilizing the platform to create Her-like chatbots designed to resemble specific characters, both real and imagined.  ""These AI applications and models have the capability to 'generate' revenue, making them AI assets that could be tokenized, traded and owned to share 'revenue stream,'"" said Sun.  MyShell provides a space for users to showcase their creations in its Discord discussion community, and most of the agents shared there tend to be AI girlfriends designed to look like cutesy anime characters ‚Äì many of which gate access behind ""not safe for work"" content warnings. Some have taken the tool in a different direction, however, using MyShell to create AI bots mimicking figures like Elon Musk, the tech mogul; and Saul Goodman, the quick-witted lawyer-criminal from Breaking Bad.  According to Sun, ""about 40% of content created by the community is AI girlfriend/companion,"" but ""the main goal of MyShell is to empower creators to build customized AI applications in a diversified range rather than just focusing on AI companions.""  ""Given the ability of third-party API integrations and comprehensive AI models to process information, it‚Äôs now possible to build applications and productivity tools without coding,"" said the MyShell CEO.  In its statement on Tuesday, MyShell noted that in addition to building out its companion-creator community, the company's tech has served as the foundation for MeloTTS, ""a pioneering open-source text-to-speech solution that closely mimics the human voice"" and Allice, an ""open-source foundation model for an AI-App development workflow.""",POSITIVE,NEAR,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | NEAR,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/03/27/myshell-blockchain-platform-for-building-ai-girlfriends-and-productivity-apps-raises-11m,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a850c47efb9fec94d5067c78fa20d9bca10f3c9a-2114x1418.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The performance could bolster valuations for other liquid restaking tokens ahead of their airdrops, one analyst noted.  Liquid restaking protocol Ether.fi's governance token (ETHFI) jumped to a record high Wednesday as hype over restaking continued to captivate crypto investors.  The token, which represents voting power in the protocol's decision-making process, surged as much as 50% in the past 24 hours to $7.2. It outperformed ether {{ETH}}, bitcoin {{BTC}} and the broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), which all posted slight declines during the same period.  With the rally, ETHFI recovered from a price slump following its March 18 airdrop, when, after initially rising to $5 on Binance, it slumped below $3 in the following days. Airdrops are distributions of free tokens, usually to early investors, users and adopters, which protocols leverage as incentives to bootstrap demand for their services.  Liquid restaking protocols such as Ether.Fi have emerged as one of the hottest new sectors in decentralized finance (DeFi), and are designed to reuse Ethereum's proof-of-stake blockchain to secure other networks through the original restaking platform, EigenLayer.  Ether.fi has become the leader in the liquid restaking field, and its total value locked (TVL) has ballooned to over $3 billion from $100 million since the start of of the year, DefiLlama data show. Rival platforms such as Kelp DAO, Puffer Finance, Renzo and Swell also attracted significant deposits, ranging from hundreds of millions of dollars to over $1 billion.

42391085,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69beUfwf,1711556549,How to Design Better On-Chain Governance,"The topic of on-chain governance has always been contentious. While off-chain governance is generally perceived as clunky, on-chain governance has allowed developers to build increasingly complex protocols allowing users to sway a network‚Äôs direction. But these are all essentially games which, if misconfigured or providing the wrong incentives, can steer the chain towards disaster.  In ‚ÄúWhat is Futarchy? ‚Äî Trading the Future,‚Äù Freiderike Ernst, the cofounder of Gnosis, highlights the standard methodologies of on-chain voting. As the ""one vote per person"" paradigm is vulnerable to Sybil attacks on permissionless networks (one person can split their capital over multiple accounts and cast multiple votes), a user's voting power is usually weighted by the token amount they hold. Lotteries and token curated registries use the same method to avoid Sybils.  Robin Hanson proposes a new governance model called futarchy, in which decisions are made based not on votes, but the results of prediction markets on the organization's welfare measure, which is an indicator of the network's growth or demise. Participants of the market will bet on the future value of the welfare measure.  Betting is usually implemented using outcome tokens, each of which represents one particular outcome of the market and whose monetary value is determined by the eventual welfare measure. Good predictions are rewarded and bad predictions result in losses.  Using outcome tokens, participants can even bet on the value of the welfare measure contingent on the implementation of the policy. For example, a participant can make a bet that pays a profit if the policy is implemented and the welfare measure increases by a certain amount, but is voided if the policy is not implemented.  For a publicly-traded company which chooses the stock price as their welfare measure and is considering firing their CEO, the upshot is that the organization obtains two predictions, the future stock price if the CEO is let go and the future stock price if the CEO is retained. As you can see from the chart below:  With futarchy, the decision that results in the highest possible welfare measure is implemented. As the final stock price prediction contingent on the CEO getting the ax is higher than the prediction contingent on the CEO being retained, the CEO is removed from the company. This takes all the emotion out of the decision process and allows the organization to make rational decisions based on what‚Äôs commonly referred to as the ‚Äúwisdom of the crowd‚Äù to improve their values.  Market Makers for Prediction Markets  Implementing a market-maker to facilitate trades between participants poses some challenges. If we want to use futarchy to evaluate more complex contingencies, markets quickly rise to tens of hundreds of tokens. Here, the ‚Äúthin market problem‚Äù rears its head: There are not enough participants to properly correct the probabilities of this many outcomes. The natural solution is an automated market maker (AMM).  A straightforward solution is the cost function implementation of the logarithmic market scoring rule. Unfortunately, this implementation does not allow ad-hoc changes of the liquidity, usually resulting in a market that is either too shallow to accommodate all participants or too deep to actually produce meaningful results. The liquidity-sensitive logarithmic market scoring rule (LS-LMSR) mitigates this problem, but the solution introduces new defects, the most severe of which is an arbitrage vulnerability which occurs in all scoring rule market makers except LMSR.  The crypto mainstay constant function market makers (CFMM) such as Balancer handle the liquidity aspect better by allowing LPs to dynamically deposit and withdraw liquidity, and are more familiar to crypto natives, but suffer from the same issue as LS-LMSR. However, it turns out that during their prediction market days, Gnosis appears to have found a CFMM implementation of the LMSR which combines the best of both worlds.",NEUTRAL,ÏóÜÏùå,BAL | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Malte Kliemann,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/03/27/how-to-design-better-on-chain-governance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6736f07d319e44d8f2fdc7c5553d10f8a790739e-6000x3376.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Hashdex Bitcoin ETF will trade under the ticker DEFI.  More than two months after the launch of ten spot bitcoin ETFs, another one has joined the race.  Trading under the ticker DEFI, asset manager Hashdex‚Äôs Bitcoin Futures ETF ‚Äì which had been trading as a futures-based fund on the New York Stock Exchange since 2022 ‚Äì was renamed and converted into the Hashdex Bitcoin ETF and now operates as a spot bitcoin fund.  In a bit of twist versus the other spot bitcoin ETFs, Hashdex in a press release said DEFI can hold up to 5% of the fund's assets in CME-traded bitcoin futures contracts.  The futures allocation will allow DEFI to better track bitcoin prices over time and provide a more predictable creation/redemption process, the company said. Such an approach is not new to ETFs and most S&P 500 ETFs use a similar strategy, the company added.  DEFI currently holds 5,500 bitcoins and a modest number of futures contracts, according to the fund's information page. The expense ratio is 0.90%, less than that of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust's (GBTC) 1.50%, but higher than the other nine spot products.  The Hashdex conversion comes over two months after the original ten spot bitcoin ETFs started trading on Jan 11. Excluding Grayscale's GBTC (which entered the spot era with nearly $30 billion in AUM), BlackRock's IBIT and Fidelity's FBTC are leading the way in asset gathering, with each having more than $10 billion in assets under management.

42391083,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69beUfrX,1711555555,The Benefits of Assets Tokenization,"At a time when the prices of many cryptocurrencies are rallying strongly, one big, recent development is underappreciated. Tokenization of ‚Äúreal world assets‚Äù has also been surging.  To understand what this development means and the potential benefits of tokenizing these assets, we need to reframe how we view the digital assets ecosystem.  We frequently here questions like: ‚ÄòWhat is the price of ether?‚Äô, ‚Äòhow correlated are digital assets with other asset classes?‚Äô, ‚Äòwhat allocation should I make to this asset class in a diversified portfolio?‚Äô. While questions like these are interesting, they all pertain to digital assets as an asset class in and of itself.  Another way to view the space is to see the various networks (e.g. the Bitcoin, Ethereum or Solana networks) as digital infrastructure. Similar to how TCP/IP or POP3/SMTP are protocols for building and commercializing services, digital asset networks are the foundation layers on which financial services (and other services) can be deployed and made available.  Asset tokenization is one such example. To quickly define this term, asset tokenization means using distributed networks and the databases that form a component of these networks to register interactions between parties.  The most tangible example seen in recent years is the emergence of stablecoins, mostly tokenized U.S. dollars. There are many ways to structure these stablecoins. One popular model is to accept U.S. dollar deposits, typically invested in U.S. Treasuries, and then issue U.S. dollar tokens against those holdings (e.g. USDC, USDT). The outstanding supply of these tokens currently stands at approximatelyUS$150 billion ‚Äì up from almost nothing five years ago.  Source:https://www.theblock.co/data/stablecoins/usd-pegged/total-stablecoin-supply  This product-market fit has now been established, and now the question is: If one can issue U.S. dollar tokens, why couldn‚Äôt one issue other currencies or assets on-chain? This is the core of what the tokenization trend seeks to provide.  Another example is U.S. Treasuries. There is currently around $750 million in tokenized U.S. Treasuries, up from a base of almost nothing just two years ago. These tokenized T-bills have one advantage over traditional stablecoins: they generate and deliver a yield. More generally, tokenized assets provide the potential for 24/7 exchange, faster settlement time (T+0) and greater accessibility as they could be used by anyone with a cell phone (for example).  These examples and others, including tokenized gold, demonstrate how digital asset networks are used as the underlying digital infrastructure for distributing financial services. When viewed through this lens, we can consider what other value-add services could be delivered via digital asset infrastructure, instead of measuring the successes of these networks by the price of their native cryptocurrency.'An ideal outcome from the use of this technology would be for a faster, cheaper, more transparent and accessible financial system for all.'",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Benjamin Dean,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/03/27/the-benefits-of-assets-tokenization,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/860c272b9645ac076e4a36b91875d9c08dfcf868-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42391077,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69beUfHd,1711555531,"UK Ad Rules Apply to Influencers, Crypto Memes, Regulator Confirms in New Guidance","The Financial Conduct Authority brought the crypto sector into the scope of its financial promotions rules last year.  While the regulator previously said the rules will apply to social media influencers, the final guidance published Tuesday sets it in stone.  Social media influencers and crypto memes fall into the scope of the U.K.'s rules for financial promotions, the country's financial watchdog said in finalized guidance published Tuesday.  The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said last July that unpaid influencers may be subject to its promotions regulation after bringing the crypto sector into its scope last October.  ""Any type of communication is capable of being a financial promotion and subject to the financial promotion restriction. We‚Äôve seen memes and other similar communications circulated on social media, with users often not realizing they may be subject to our rules. The use of memes in promotions is particularly prevalent in the crypto-asset sector,"" the guidance said.  U.K. social media influencers have already been scrutinized for their involvement with crypto. In 2022, former reality show contestants Jessica and Eve Gale were told to stop misleading their followers with pro-crypto posts.  The guidance is based on the FCA's promotions regime, which says that a business should not communicate an ""invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity"" unless the promotion is communicated by an authorized person or a person with an exemption. This includes influencers who are operating in the ""course of business, which could mean they are employed or have a commercial interest in posting the communication, the guidance said.  Now that crypto firms are in the FCA's regulatory scope, firms or promoters must register with the FCA or have their ads approved by someone who has the credentials to do so. They are also required to include clear risk warnings on websites and communications and give first-time buyers a 24-hour cooling-off period before finalizing purchases.

Citing the development in the Bitcoin Macro Oscillator and the possibility of traditional finance jumping on the bandwagon (FOMO), the odds of BTC rallying in at least two strong legs up in the coming session could not be discounted. On-Chain Data Signals More Upside For Bitcoin In a post on X, Woo remains confident about what lies ahead for the world‚Äôs most valuable cryptocurrency. Based on on-chain development, there are indicators that the coin may firmly push higher, breaking above the current lull. Related Reading: AI Tokens Fetch.AI, AGIX, OCEAN Talk Merger, Surge Double Digits Bitcoin remains mostly range-bound when writing, trading within a tight zone capped by $73,800 on the upper end and $69,000 as immediate support. Even with analysts being confident of what lies ahead, the coin has failed to overcome strong selling momentum from sellers to breach all-time highs in a buy-trend continuation. From how the coin is set up, the current sideways movement may be accumulation or distribution, depending on the breakout direction. For instance, any upswing above $72,400 might spur demand, lifting the coin towards $73,800. Conversely, losses below $69,000 and the middle BB might see BTC slump to March 5 lows or even lower. Will TradFi FOMO And Short Squeeze Lift BTC? Even with the slowdown in upside momentum, Woo says there is strong potential for ‚Äúanother solid leg up.‚Äù The analyst also added that there could be two surges if TradFi investors ‚ÄúFOMO‚Äù into Bitcoin. In the 2017 bull run, the rally to $20,000 was primarily due to retailers jumping in and FOMOing on the coin. With spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) available in the United States, speculation is that more institutions and high-net-worth individuals are buying the coin. If BTC rips higher, breaking $74,000, more inflow will likely be into the multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs, fueling demand. Related Reading: Litecoin ETF Rumors Fuel 10% Surge As Institutions Hint At Interest This bullish outlook comes when other analysts expect Bitcoin to surge in the sessions ahead. In a post on X, one analyst¬†says¬†the incoming short squeeze will likely propel the coin above March highs. Whenever a short squeeze happens, prices rise, forcing sellers to buy back at higher prices, accelerating the uptrend.

Shiba Inu Takes Europe By Storm XRP enthusiast and market expert Marcel Knobloch, also known as Collin Brown, reported the coin‚Äôs latest milestone on X. According to Brown, Shiba Inu has seen significant growth in its long-term investor base, taking Europe by storm by becoming the second most search crypto in the continent. Brown noted that the milestone is reminiscent of the peak of 2021, having rallied a startling 300% in just 8 days. SHIB‚Äôs interest is not limited to Europe, and it¬†has taken the top spot on search charts all the way from Italy to Nigeria. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Takes Over The Internet: Google Searches Climb As Global Interest Surges As a result of the development, WazirX‚Äôs poll has crowned SHIB the king of meme cryptos. Thus, Collin Brown has urged the cryptocurrency space to watch out for Shiba Inu, noting that the Shiba pack is at the forefront of the race. The rankings were determined following a comprehensive analysis of Google Trends data in the past 1 year in order to ascertain the cryptocurrency that, based on searches, each nation in Europe desires to invest in. After gathering collective data, the findings showed a noteworthy pattern that indicated changes in people‚Äôs interest in the crypto market. Shiba Inu went past notable coins like Ethereum (ETH) ‚Äì the second largest crypto asset, Cardano (ADA), and Dogecoin (DOGE) ‚Äì the largest meme coin, securing the top pick in about 7 European countries. These include Russia, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and among others. Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) ‚Äì the largest crypto asset remains the most searched coin in the continent acquiring top choice in about 21 European nations, such as Poland, Germany, Belgium, Romania, etc. Latest Milestone Buttresses SHIB‚Äôs Price SHIB‚Äôs recent achievement displays a constant rise in its interest, reflecting the trust of its community members around the world. In addition to bolstering SHIB‚Äôs standing, this ranking indicates that European investors are considering adopting the token even more. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Ecosystem Blooms: BONE Jumps 44% With $3 Target In Sight Following the project‚Äôs landmark, the Ethereum-based memecoin has managed to secure gains of over 18% in the past week. SHIB has experienced a rebound to the $0.000030 threshold, after falling as low as $0.000025 during the start of the week. With the memecoin market demonstrating momentum presently, SHIB might be poised for more significant gains in the coming months. Consequently, SHIB‚Äôs rise to the aforementioned price has taken advantage of the market‚Äôs general recovery and its seven-day upswing.

42391097,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69beUmJb,1711551450,The Enablers of Decentralized AI,"Decentralized AI is regaining prominence in recent months as more people start to explore the intersection of Web3 and generative AI. While most people agree that decentralization can have positive benefits for AI, the specific technical paths run into major roadblocks.  For instance, while we all think that decentralized compute networks (DePIN) can help counterbalance the GPU accumulation games dominated by big tech platforms, the reality is that the pre-training and fine-tuning requirements of large foundation models require concentrated GPU topologies with massive communication buses.  Similarly, decentralized data networks seem like a clear idea to mitigate the increasing data concentration in large companies. But, in practice, the attempts to solve that problem have seen very mediocre traction.  When thinking about decentralizing AI, it is important to realize that AI tends to increasingly evolve more towards centralized architectures, which makes any decentralization effort incredibly challenging. For decentralized generative AI to overcome those natural challenges, it needs to rely on or influence four key trends:  For decentralized AI to become feasible, open-source generative AI needs to become more mainstream  Decentralized AI is an inference game and nothing else  Web3 compute and data infrastructures need to scale to meet the demands of foundation models  Foundation models need to be adapted to run in decentralized infrastructures. Mostly every path to decentralized AI is dependent on flavors of these four ideas.   AI as a centralization force  In the history of technology, there are trends that fundamentally evolve towards centralized markets, while others are more open and balanced markets. Mobile is the canonical example of a technology that evolved towards a centralized market with two main players.  This is mostly given to the complex requirements in terms of hardware, software, research, supply chain, and distribution, which only a few companies can master. Other trends, such as databases, started as centralization forces with companies like Oracle, IBM, and Microsoft, and evolved into more competitive markets with a lot of open-source players.  AI has one of the most centralized DNAs of any tech in history. This is obviously due to the dependencies in areas such as compute or data, which are also fundamentally centralized. From that perspective, it is natural to expect that the AI market will be dominated by a handful of companies.  Any centralized market can use a counterbalancing force. In that sense, it is tempting to think that blockchains could be that element. While that conclusion is directionally correct, in order to materialize, it will require the push of external market forces as well as the mainstream adoption of open source generative AI and the evolution of Web3 infrastructure and foundation models.  Open-Source Generative AI Needs to Become Mainstream  There is no decentralized generative AI without open source generative AI. The wave of innovation in open-source generative AI is certainly breathtaking, but only a handful of companies, such as HuggingFace, Meta, Mistral, or Stability, are viable alternatives to OpenAI, Anthropic or Google.  Decentralized AI will focus on inference workflows with open-source foundation models  Enterprise applications with strong security and privacy constraints, as well as AI startups in regulated industries, seem to be strong growth vectors for open-source generative AI. In those scenarios, Web3 AI infrastructure can become a viable alternative. If we assume that open-source generative AI will gain some level of mainstream adoption, the next challenge is to understand which use cases within the lifecycle of generative AI solutions are well-suited for decentralized infrastructures.  Decentralized AI is an inference game  In simplistic terms, the lifecycle of generative AI models can be divided into three main phases: pre-training, fine-tuning and inference.  The first two have to do with getting models to generalize knowledge based on data, while inference is related to the predictions outputted by models. The extremely large size of foundation models and their complex compute requirements make decentralized infrastructures completely impractical for pre-training and fine-tuning scenarios.  Those workflows require hundreds or thousands of GPUs connected by high-performance communication buses that can ingest data and recalculate weights in a model for weeks or months. Not to mention that the data required for pre-training and fine-tuning is often stored in cloud data centers, and it results in being completely cost-prohibitive to move it to a decentralized infrastructure.  Inference is a much more practical scenario for decentralized generative AI and, arguably, the only one that could work in the current state of technologies. From a market perspective, inference workloads also account for a larger percentage of generative AI revenues. Now that we know that decentralized AI will focus on inference workflows with open-source foundation models, we need to figure out which type of Web3 infrastructure can support those use cases.  Web3 infrastructures need to grow  The current generation of blockchain runtimes has not been designed to run large foundation models, even for inference use cases. To address that challenge, new blockchain runtimes optimized for larger and more complex compute workloads are definitely needed. Off-chain inference computation is a nice middle ground, but one that doesn't fully address the centralization concerns with generative AI.  Foundation models need to become smaller  Last year, Microsoft coined the term ""small language models"" based on its work on a foundation model called Phi and the iconic paper ""Textbooks is All You Need"". The small Phi was only 3B parameters and was pre-trained on a series of computer science textbooks, and it was able to outperform 70B models in math and computer science tasks.  The work on Phi signaled that smaller and more specialized models are one of the most important steps towards the adoption of generative AI. In the same way that Web3 infrastructures need to scale to adopt foundation models, the SLM trend can make models more practical to run on Web3 infrastructure. It is unlikely we will see a Web3 infrastructure running a trillion parameter model in the near future, but 2B-3B is definitely possible.  Difficult but possible path to decentralized AI  The idea of decentralized generative AI is conceptually trivial but practically very difficult. AI naturally evolves as an increasingly centralized technology, and any decentralization efforts are an uphill battle. The mainstream adoption of open source generative AI models is essential for the viability of decentralized AI infrastructures. Similarly, the current state of generative AI suggests that most of the initial use cases of decentralized AI will focus on inference rather than pre-training or fine-tuning. Finally, to make decentralized AI practical, Web3 infrastructures need to scale on several orders of magnitude, while foundation models need to become smaller and more adaptable to decentralized environments.  That combination of factors represents the best path towards decentralized generative AI. That path will be extremely difficult but, at least for now, certainly possible.",NEUTRAL,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | RESEARCH,Jesus Rodriguez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/03/27/the-enablers-of-decentralized-ai,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/74c6ec622d0fd2f75fc0055818176d963fe81d22-612x408.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42391094,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69beUm4D,1711548673,Coinbase Loses Most of Motion to Dismiss SEC Lawsuit,"A federal judge ruled that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission brought enough of a case arguing that Coinbase is operating as an unregistered broker, exchange and clearinghouse that its suit against the cryptocurrency company should move forward.  Judge Katherine Polk Failla, of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, on Wednesday ruled against most of Coinbase's motion to dismiss the SEC lawsuit, finding that the regulatory agency had a ""plausible"" case against the exchange. She set an April 19 deadline for the parties to agree on a case scheduling plan.  The SEC sued Coinbase last year, the same week it sued fellow exchange Binance, alleging that it was violating federal securities laws by making trading and staking services available to the general public. It also argued that Coinbase Wallet acted as an unregistered brokerage.  ""We're pleased that yet another court has confirmed that, while the term 'crypto' may be relatively new, the framework that courts have used to identify securities for nearly 80 years still applies,"" an SEC spokesperson said in an email. ""It's the economic realities of a transaction, not the labels, that determine whether a particular offering constitutes a security.""  While the judge said that the SEC seemed to have an argument that some of the tokens listed on Wallet might meet the standards for ""investment contracts,"" Coinbase didn't seem to be acting as a brokerage, dismissing that part of the suit.  The other aspects of the suit can proceed, she ruled, dismissing claims that the SEC is violating the Major Questions Doctrine (a U.S. Supreme Court ruling prohibiting federal agencies from exceeding their congressional mandates) or the Administrative Procedures Act. Indeed, Coinbase had ample notice the SEC was pressing cases against crypto companies, the judge ruled, pointing to the DAO Report and previous cases.  ""When a customer purchases a token on Coinbase's platform, she is not just purchasing a token, which in and of itself is valueless; rather, she is buying into the token's digital ecosystem, the growth of which is necessarily tied to value of the token,"" she said. ""This is evidenced by, among others, the facts that (i) initial coin offerings are engineered to have resale value in the secondary markets and (ii) crypto-asset issuers continue to publicize their plans to expand and support the token's blockchain long after its initial offering.""  Similarly, token developers ""advertise the fact that capital raised through retail sales of tokens will continue to be re-invested,"" she noted.  These cases often survive past motions to dismiss, such as the SEC's case against Ripple. The judges are required to take the allegations as facts, but the substantive parts of the case will be argued later.  The case is one of many that may define how the crypto industry can operate in the U.S. If a judge rules that exchanges must be treated similarly to national securities exchanges, as the SEC seems to want, it would impose new restrictions and disclosure regulations on these trading platforms, as well as potentially limit the number of tokens available to retail investors.

24867738,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=600021,1711548039,"The Road To $100,000: Bitcoin Whale Accumulation Explodes","Bitcoin reaching $100,000 remains a highly feasible target, especially given the fact that the price of the cryptocurrency hit a new all-time high above $73,00 ahead of the halving. In preparation of the explosive move that is expected to follow the halving, Bitcoin whales are going all out as they fill up their wallets with BTC. Large Bitcoin Whales Buy More BTC As the Bitcoin price has retraced from its surge, large Bitcoin whales are taking advantage of the dip to buy more coins at cheap prices. These whales, which hold at least 1,000 BTC ‚Äì which means they have $70 million on the low end, have bought up a large tranche of coins over the last three months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP Price Will Rally 800% To $6, Here‚Äôs When Since January, there has been a steady climb in the number of wallets that hold at least 1,000 as interest continues to grow. A lot of this interest is driven by institutional investors who are putting billions of dollars into Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Now, with the condition that issuers have to hold the BTC they sell to customers, it has seen these institutions buy up a good chunk of the supply. The number of addresses holding at least 1,000 BTC was sitting at less than 1,500 at the beginning of the year. However, by March, with institutions ramping up their buys, this number has climbed to 1,617. This is an 8% increase in the number of these large whales in the last three months. Source: Glassnode To put this increase in perspective, the last time that there were these many whales holding this much BTC was back in 2021 at the peak of the bull market. So, if this number is rising once again, it means that these large investors are expecting the price to rise, and as a result, are trying to maximize their profits. Spot ETF Inflows See 2,600% Spike After a week of consistent outflows, inflows into the Spot Bitcoin ETFs are starting to ramp up once again. For the first day of the week, inflows climbed to $14.5 million, bringing a welcome change from the almost $900 million worth of outflows that was recorded in the prior week. This change in the tide seems to have brought renewed interest for investors as Tuesday saw a whopping 2,600% increase in inflows. In total, there $418 million recorded going into Spot BTC ETFs on Tuesday, one of the highest inflow days since the ETFs were approved. Related Reading: Ripple CEO Responds To SEC‚Äôs Shocking $2 Billion Demand This change in direction is also evident in the Bitcoin price, which has recovered from last week‚Äôs low of $60,000. The price has since sprung back up above $70,000, with a 10% increase in the last week. This also validates the whales‚Äô moves to acquire more Bitcoin, putting the vast majority of their holdings in profit. Now, as seen in the past, a return of high inflows into the Spot ETFs has always been bullish for the price. So, if the inflows were to continue throughout this week, then the price of Bitcoin could register a brand new all-time high ahead of the halving.

42391110,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69beUnTP,1711547006,"Amid Giant Crypto Rally, Hopes for Another DeFi Summer Soar","DeFi yields have exceeded yields from conventional investments like U.S. Treasuries, raising hopes for rekindled interest and maybe another DeFi Summer.  MakerDAO's DAI Savings Rate provides users with a 15% yield, while riskier corners of DeFi can earn 27% through the likes of Ethena Labs.  ""The bull market saw prices slowly start going up, and now, two months later, it's completely opposite again, in terms of looking at rates in DeFi and TradFi,"" one expert said.  Decentralized finance, or DeFi, languished in 2023, one of many hardships the cryptocurrency industry faced.  Because the Federal Reserve and other central banks were hiking interest rates, conventional ‚Äì and, in many cases, less risky ‚Äì investments looked more appealing. Why stick your money in some DeFi pool when safer U.S. Treasuries had higher yields?  But DeFi now looks ascendant as the cryptocurrency industry roars back to life, triggering memories of 2020, aka DeFi Summer, when the space bustled with activity.  Whereas the median DeFi yield, averaged over seven days, dwelled below 3% for most of 2023 and dipped below 2% several times, earlier this month it leapt to almost 6%, according to data from DefiLlama. Plugging collateral into MakerDAO's DAI Savings Rate provides users with a 15% yield. Those comfortable enough to delve into the riskier corners of DeFi can earn 27% through the likes of Ethena Labs.  These higher levels exceed the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, the interest rate banks use to price U.S. dollar-denominated derivatives and loans, which is currently around 5.3%.  Strong institutional tailwinds have driven the current crypto bull market, which was kicked off by the January arrival of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds from the likes of BlackRock and Fidelity, but also by traditional financial firms' interest in the so-called tokenization of real-world assets ‚Äì representing ownership of conventional assets via blockchain-traded tokens.  Over the past year or so, with yields from fixed-income products rivaling what was on offer at DeFi platforms, traditional finance firms like JPMorgan and BlackRock and crypto startups like Ondo Finance have focused their crypto efforts on tokenizing higher-yielding assets like U.S. Treasuries and money-market funds.  Outgunning TradFi rates  But crypto and DeFi began heating up in October, according to S√©bastien Derivaux, co-founder of Steakhouse Financial. It was the point at which DeFi rates began to compete with and later outgun SOFR. Crypto-native DeFi products, rather than tokenized conventional financial products, began looking more appealing.  ""It is customary that when there is a bull market, rates go up in lending protocols,"" he said via Telegram. ""It was even more in perpetual markets (assuming it is because retail degens find it easier to use offshore exchanges providing perp markets than leveraging on DeFi).""  The couple months following the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs have seen this trend intensify, a parallel to the relatively rapid hike in interest rates that followed the intensification of the Covid crisis in early 2020, said Lucas Vogelsang, CEO of Centrifuge, a firm that has pioneered the tokenization of real-world assets, or RWAs.  ""We've actually had two complete changes in the market. You had the Fed change rates overnight, basically; at least it went from zero to 2% or 3% pretty quickly and that completely changed the face of DeFi,"" Vogelsang said in an interview. ""The bull market saw prices slowly start going up, and now, two months later, it's completely opposite again, in terms of looking at rates in DeFi and TradFi.""  'Sign of immaturity'  Because the crypto industry remains relatively small, there's simply not enough capital to lend to people who are bullish and, as a result, they don't mind borrowing at high rates. While institutions are clearly interested in crypto, they are not actually filling gaps in market demand, Vogelsang pointed out. ""A money market off-chain wouldn't yield 12% just because there's a lack of supply; someone would fill it. On-chain, that's not the case,"" he said. ""It's a sign of immaturity in that way.""  Some DeFi lending rates might look unsustainably high, an uncomfortable reminder of crypto projects that blew up in years past. But the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio is relatively low on platforms like Morpho Labs, for instance, said Rob Hadick, general partner at Dragonfly.  ""I don't actually think lending is back; I think deposits are back,"" Hadick said in an interview. ""I think that's because people want yield. But there's not as much rehypothecation happening right now as there was a few years ago.""  Hadick, whose firm is an investor in Ethena Labs, pointed out the super-high yields available on that platform are not underpinned by pure leverage, but rather follow a basis trade ‚Äì long spot markets and short the related futures.  ""As the markets change, the rate might come down. But it's not like leverage in the traditional sense,"" Hadick said. ""People are just going to unwind the trade when it's no longer economic, as opposed to 'I'm going to blow up and my collateral is gonna get liquidated.' That's not a thing that happens in this type of trading.""",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BTC | MARKET | TRADING | ONDO | ENA,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/03/27/hopes-for-another-defi-summer-soar-as-tradfi-markets-suddenly-look-less-appealing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/446b06c34d3e3bef1b03859028b5c976fc7eb02f-2670x1502.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

TON is the native token of The Open Network, which is the blockchain of choice for Telegram's Web3 infrastructure.  Telegram started work on TON in 2018, later abandoning it following action from the SEC.  Crypto asset manager 21Shares listed an exchange-traded product (ETP) for staking toncoin {{TON}}, the token of The Open Network, which has received endorsement of messaging app Telegram.  The 21Shares Toncoin Staking ETP (TONN), which listed on Swiss SIX Exchange on Wednesday, will offer investors staking rewards without the hassle of setting up and managing their own node, the asset manager said in an email.  Staking is a way of earning passive income on crypto tokens by offering them to a blockchain network to help it run and receiving a yield in return.  The TON blockchain was started in-house by Telegram in 2018, but it abandoned development in August 2020 after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleged it was selling unregistered securities.  Members of the community, however, took the project forward while maintaining an association with Telegram. In September last year, the messaging app officially stamped the network with its endorsement and designated it as its network of choice for Web3 infrastructure.  Long before it became one of the firms to list a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S., 21Shares had been listing similar products in Europe under the ""ETP"" designation.  Zurich-headquartered 21Shares surpassed $5 billion in assets under management (AUM) earlier this month.

42391096,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69beUmOj,1711542600,Crypto Chip Company Katena Wins Lawsuit Filed by Bitcoin Miner Coinmint,"Crypto technology firm Katena Computing didn't trick miner Coinmint into a $150 million purchase agreement, a panel of arbitrators ruled last month in the mining company's suit against Katena and a semiconductor company called DX Corr.  Coinmint alleged in a lawsuit filed last year that Katena and DX Corr conspired to trick it into purchasing $150 million worth of bitcoin mining machines that were never delivered. Coinmint, in the suit, claimed that Katena bribed or otherwise influenced Coinmint's former chief financial officer, Michael Maloney, to secure the sale, knowing full well it wouldn't be able to deliver mining chips it was still developing. The mining company demanded $23 million it had paid to Katena back.  A panel of arbitrators ruled in February that Katena hadn't violated its agreements or deceived Coinmint, denying all of Coinmint's claims and awarding Katena just over $14 million.  The arbitration panel found, according to a document filed in the court docket, that the evidence suggested Coinmint and its executives independently chose to make the $150 million purchase, ""without pressure or influence by Katena,"" after initially negotiating a $100 million deal that Coinmint itself raised to $150 million.  The panel also ruled that Katena hadn't breached any contracts in its agreements with Coinmint, saying that Coinmint itself admitted it hadn't met all of the conditions it needed.  While Coinmint cited text messages shared between Katena executives as evidence the company was influencing Maloney, the panel said in its report that these messages were more ""brainstorming and ambitious chatter"" than concrete evidence the company was actively moving to hire the then-CFO at Coinmint.  The panel also ruled that Katena hadn't misrepresented the state of a chip it was developing in marketing materials to Coinmint.  ""Katena submitted extensive evidence ‚Äì without any evidentiary rebuttal or impeachment by Coinmint ‚Äì concerning the design of the ASIC [application-specific integrated circuit] chip for the K10 and getting the chip design ready for submission to the foundry, including running simulations to test for errors in the chip's design,"" the artibrators' order said.  Katena also submitted other evidence that suggested it was actively working to manufacture the chips and miners it intended to sell Coinmint, refuting one of Coinmint's claims that Katena did not intend to produce the machines.  ""We went through a full discovery process in which Katena produced everything according the panel's orders, in which Coinmint avoided producing everything,"" said Michael Gao, a founder and partner at Katena. ""We both had the opportunity ‚Ä¶ to hire expert witnesses, obviously to defend our case. Cointmint did hire their own expert witness and they had the opportunity to review all of our technical plans, as well as anything in our due diligence report. So they had full access to basically all of the materials produced in discovery.""  According to Gao, Coinmint's team struggled to identify any false claims made by Katena. The panel's ultimate report reflected this, in that Katena didn't win on any technicalities, but based on the facts that the panel found, he said.  Not over yet  Coinmint plans to file a motion to vacate the arbitration award, its new attorneys said in court filings.  According to emails attached as an exhibit to its motion to vacate, the company is taking issue with how the arbitration process unfolded. Steven Feldman, an attorney representing Coinmint, wrote in an email that the panel ""undermined any semblance of due process,"" citing a decision to block transcripts from certain witnesses as one example.  In its motion for an extension, Coinmint's attorneys wrote that they believe there are grounds to vacate the order, pointing to the lack of recorded testimony as one example.  ""Material factual findings in the Award are plagued by the Panel‚Äôs prohibition of a record. For example, the Award asserts that there was no evidence that one witness, Coinmint‚Äôs former Chief Financial Officer, Michael Maloney, was offered a job at Katena ‚Äì a key component of Katena‚Äôs alleged wrongdoing,"" the filing said. ""That is patently false as Maloney admitted to the contrary in his testimony ‚Äì testimony that the Panel blocked Coinmint from recording.""  An attorney for Katena disputed Coinmint's characterization of the process, according to the emails filed as an exhibit. Jacob Taber, of Perkins Coie, wrote in one email that ""the parties have fought long and hard for years. ‚Ä¶ Coinmint lost.""  ""As I'm sure you can appreciate, our client has already been waiting for years for your client to pay what was owed under the contract and is very interested in a quick resolution to any dispute regarding the award,"" he said in another email.  District Judge Richard Seeborg, the Northern District of California jurist overseeing the case, granted an extension for Coinmint to file its opposition and motion to vacate by April 1.  A request for comment sent to an attorney for Coinmint who took over after the arbitration process ended and an inquiry sent via its website were not immediately returned.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/03/27/crypto-chip-company-katena-wins-lawsuit-filed-by-bitcoin-miner-coinmint,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3c41a0231d78933b542741460696230f0d9d80a7-4802x2701.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Hashrate refers to the total combined computational power that is being used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain, such as Bitcoin.  ‚ÄúFrom a year ago, the network hashrate has nearly doubled, but the publicly traded miners have lost market share,‚Äù analysts Jonathan Petersen and Amanda Santillo wrote.  Marathon Digital (MARA) had previously used third-party providers to host its machines rather than building its own infrastructure, the report noted, but the company has changed strategy and is buying out some of the hosting services, a ‚Äúdefensive move ahead of the halving,‚Äù and a strategy Jefferies says it supports.  ‚ÄúThe scale of MARA is a competitive advantage when it comes to buying more ASICs to grow and maintain market share,‚Äù the authors wrote.  The bank maintained its hold rating on Marathon Digital shares, and cut its price target to $24 from $30 to ‚Äúreflect the downtime at the Applied Digital sites, which has weighed on our confidence of future uptime assumptions.‚Äù  It increased its price target on hold-rated Argo Blockchain (ARBK) to $1.50 from $1.20 to reflect the higher bitcoin price. ‚ÄúWith less capex dedicated to mining facility development ARBK should have cash to buy additional miners and increase hashrate more quickly,‚Äù the bank said.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Financial powerhouse HSBC (HSBA) is tokenizing gold for everyday investors in Hong Kong and claiming bragging rights as the first bank to create a blockchain-based real-world asset aimed at the retail marketplace. The HSBC Gold Token, minted on the bank‚Äôs Orion digital assets platform, is available via HSBC Online Banking and HSBC HK Mobile App, the bank said in a press release on Wednesday. Banks and financial institutions are bringing a range of real-world assets (RWA) onto blockchains, both private ledgers and public networks like Ethereum, in a process known as tokenization.  Galaxy Digital (GLXY), the crypto financial services firm headed by Michael Novogratz, had a strong end to 2023 with solid operating results across its diversified business, broker Canaccord Genuity said in a research report on Wednesday. Canaccord notes that while the fourth quarter was solid, commentary about the performance of the Toronto-listed business through the end of February was even better. Positive highlights include an almost doubling of assets under management (AUM) from year-end to more than $10 billion, equity capital growing to over $2.1 billion versus about $1.5 billion at the end of the third quarter, and quarter-to-date income before tax of around $300 million, the report said.  El Salvador, the nation that made bitcoin legal tender in 2021, continues to increase its bitcoin (BTC) holdings. The country‚Äôs president, Nayib Bukele, said on Monday that the nation now owns 5,700 bitcoin versus mid-March's roughly 5,690. At bitcoin's current price just above $70,000, El Salvador's bitcoin stack is worth more than $400 million. Bukele earlier this month said the country's bitcoin holdings had been moved to cold storage and published the address of its bitcoin wallet. That wallet showed just under 5,690 BTC, significantly more than the amount public trackers of El Salvador's holdings had estimated.

Yet criminality through crypto has risen in some forms. For example, sales of illicit drugs on darknet marketplaces grew to $1.6 billion from $1.3 billion recorded in 2022.  Illicit activity in the cryptocurrency ecosystem appears to have reduced, with the total illicit funds shrinking by 9% in 2023 compared to 2022, even though criminals still handled nearly $35 billion worth of cryptocurrencies, blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs found.  TRM Labs published a report titled ‚ÄúThe Illicit Crypto Economy‚Äù on Wednesday, which looked at the key trends of 2023.  The firm found that scams and frauds accounted for nearly a third of all crypto crimes 2023. Critically, the share of illicit funds in crypto fell over 2023, even though TRM found it is still substantially higher than existing industry estimates.  Regulatory pressure appears to have resulted in a drop in hacked and sanctions-exposed funds volumes. The report said the U.S. alone ‚Äútripled the number of crypto crime-linked entities and individuals subject to sanctions.‚Äù However, hackers linked to North Korea made off with 30% less than they did in 2022. Hack proceeds fell by over 50% to $1.8 billion from $3.7 billion in 2022.  The report also stated that sales of fentanyl and its precursor materials dropped by 150% in volume between 2023 and 2022. Yet, vendor sales increased by over 97% year-on-year, from $16 million to $33 million.  However, sales of illicit drugs on darknet marketplaces grew to $1.6 billion from $1.3 billion recorded in 2022.  The report said almost half of all illicit crypto volume (45% in 2023, up from 41% in 2022) occurred on the TRON Blockchain. Stablecoin Tether (USDT) had the largest share of illegal volume, at $19.3 billion, compared to Ethereum (24%) and Bitcoin (18%).

Riot Platforms has a strong risk/reward profile and a potential breakout pending from a symmetrical triangle pattern. RIOT's valuation relative to Bitcoin is extremely low, making it a potentially attractive investment opportunity. The rally in Bitcoin has taken a number of crypto-related stocks to the moon with it thus far this year. The coin itself is flying, but crypto-related stocks, in a lot of cases, have orders of magnitude more in terms of year-to-date gains as a result. One area of the market that's done very well on this Bitcoin rally is miners, but not all miners are created equal. About four months ago, I called Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) a Strong Buy , noting at the time it looked like Riot would break its multi-year downtrend. The stock looked good at the time, and I thought Bitcoin would rally into 2024. We've definitely seen the latter, but Riot melted down and the breakout never materialized. I was wrong, but that's why we use stops and avoid being a bag holder. Now that I've taken my lumps over being wrong in December, let's take a look at Riot today, which appears to have a much better risk/reward profile, particularly as it relates to the valuation. Let's dig in. A clear line in the sand Let's start with the daily price chart to ground ourselves in the current technical outlook. For me, we have very clear lines being drawn (literally and figuratively) between bulls and bears. We can use these lines to frame out risk and reward quite effectively. StockCharts This is a chart of the past ~10 months and we can see the vast majority of this time has been Riot forming a symmetrical triangle pattern. This pattern is huge , so whatever way it ultimately breaks should produce a very large move. We had another successful test of the bottom trendline a few days ago, and the stock was up 9% on Monday. In addition, the PPO really looks terrific given it made a higher low, and the histogram has just gone positive. These things indicate improving bullish momentum, or said another way, a lack of selling momentum. To my eye, that increases the odds that the next big move is up. As far as levels to watch, this one is very straightforward. I don't want to own it anywhere under the up-sloping trendline, and we're looking ultimately for a breakout of the down-sloping trendline to confirm completion of this pattern. That's probably some time away, but for now, the top of the pattern is still almost 50% higher than today's price. Something that has changed in recent months with Riot, and for the better if you're trying to get long, is its action relative to Bitcoin itself. With miners, we can measure relative value by comparing Bitcoin's price action against the miner stock, which is what I've done below. In the first panel, we have Riot's correlation to Bitcoin on a rolling one-month basis, and in the bottom panel, Riot's stock price relative to the price of Bitcoin. StockCharts We can see the correlation of Riot to Bitcoin completely broke down in early March, and is actually negative, oddly enough. In other words, Riot exists basically to mine and sell Bitcoin, but the price of its stock is actually trading inversely to Bitcoin. That's strange, and I fully expect this to right itself and go positive again. In theory, that could see Riot's share price ""catch up"" to the move Bitcoin has made essentially without it. More importantly, the bottom panel shows Riot's share price against Bitcoin absolutely imploding in recent months. This measure is down an eye-popping 73% since last July and has steadily eroded for nearly the entire time. What this means is that Riot's valuation relative to Bitcoin is extremely low right now, so you can think of this as analogous to a company trading for a very low P/E ratio against its historical norms. In that case, the value of the stock is attractive, and I see Riot as exactly the same setup. It exists to mine Bitcoin, so the value of the stock against Bitcoin is the most important measure of value I can think of. Right now, I cannot see any result other than Riot being extremely cheap fundamentally. Let's briefly look at the weekly, longer-term chart to see what's what on a more zoomed-out view of Riot. StockCharts We can see the triangle I mentioned above, and it's really massive, spanning back over a year depending upon how you draw it. The point is that this kind of coiling results in a big move, so the way this triangle ultimately breaks is of the utmost importance. One more thing on this chart is the valuation discussion, which I have in the bottom panel here as well. The valuation relative to Bitcoin is not only at multi-year lows but is also at the point where it shot skyward at least three other times in the past. Does that guarantee it will happen again? Absolutely not. Does it make it much more likely? I believe it does, and that's a big reason why I see Riot's next move being up and out of this triangle. Fundamentals support a higher valuation and share price I'm quite bullish on Riot's technical picture (in case that wasn't clear) so long as the up-sloping trendline is respected. Now, let's take a look at the fundamental picture to see if it's supportive of the bull case. Investor presentation Riot managed to boost its production quite significantly during 2023, and there's definitely more where that came from. Its hash rate deployment rose 28%, consistent with the number of rigs it grew by during the year. Bitcoin and Bitcoin-equivalent production rose even more, adding 40% from 2022. One thing that I believe is a source of strength for Riot at the moment is its half-billion dollar-plus stash of Bitcoin. At the end of the year, it had 7.4k coins, which are worth well in excess of $500 million today. That affords Riot not only value but the ability to self-finance growth plans, which we'll look at in a bit. One thing that is a wildcard and a potential risk for Riot, to be fair, is margins. Investor presentation The cost of mining jumps around a ton for Riot, as do resulting gross margins and operating margins. Investors hate one thing more than anything else, and that is uncertainty. Riot's margins are a source of uncertainty, so it's something I watch very closely in each earnings report. The company's newer rigs provide lower-cost mining capabilities, so in theory, we should see stronger margins. The problem is that network difficulty continues to rise, something that will only worsen over time. Riot can combat this with its growth plans for its rigs, but this is a nontrivial headwind we must monitor. The upcoming halving event is a big one for miners, as it will effectively increase the cost of mining Bitcoin. However, Riot's costs - as you can see in the slide above - is very low. It was under $14k per coin in Q4, and while we'll get a read for Q1 numbers when it next reports earnings, the real impact will be the Q2 update that includes the impact of halving on mining difficulty. Bitcoin at (or anywhere near) $70k means Riot will still be plenty profitable on a gross margin basis, which should also improve as mining scale grows. In addition, the halving is a well-known upcoming event so the stock (and indeed, all miner stocks) is being priced for the impending impact of it. Looking ahead Let's briefly touch on Riot's growth plans, as they are immense. The company is just over 12 EH/s right now but has plans to ~8X that eventually. Investor presentation It can do this via acquisitions, as well as big order volume for newer, more efficient rigs. We can see the growth plan for later this year, as Riot believes it will end 2024 with ~31EH/s, which would be ~2.5X where it started in 2024 if it comes to fruition. Riot has options to buy at least 100EH/s of capacity for the long-term, but first things first, we need to see it execute on reaching its goal of 31EH/s for this year. The point here is that capacity growth potential is massive for Riot, which will help it combat ever-rising network difficulty going forward. Again, this is a key tenet of the bull case. As a point of comparison, Marathon Digital ( MARA ) has about 29 EH/s installed right now, on the way to about 50 next year. Marathon Investor Presentation Another large scale miner, CleanSpark ( CLSK ), is in a similar position. CleanSpark investor presentation The company is expecting ~32 EH/s by the end of this year, and 50 by the end of 2025. On this evidence, Riot is extremely competitive with the other largest scale miners of Bitcoin, meaning it should still be in a very competitive position post-halving. This includes both scale and cost. I mentioned above that Riot is in a favorable position with its financing, and we can see that illustrated below. Investor presentation The company has ~$600 million in cash, nearly that much again in Bitcoin held, and additional Bitcoin coming in every day via mining operations. Its major capex plans are listed above, and you can see even with its Corsicana facility build-out and miners to fill it, Riot is completely self-funded through at least 2025. I cannot stress how important this is for a Bitcoin miner to be in such a favorable financial position, and it only adds to the bull case in my view. To be fair, Riot has significantly diluted shareholders over time in order to fund its operations. TIKR The share count has mushroomed over time as Riot dilutes shareholders in order to fund operations, but also growth. We'll have to wait and see what happens but if Bitcoin pricing remains favorable, as it is now, the need to further dilute should diminish over time. The company says it has already fully funded 2024 capex, as well as for 2025, so it would appear to me that barring some massive change, additional dilution should need to occur. Wrapping up I got it wrong in December. I identified a setup that ultimately failed, which happens. If every setup materialized, we'd all be billionaires, but that's not reality. I am, however, sticking with my Strong Buy on Riot because the chart looks quite favorable from a risk/reward perspective, and the valuation of the stock is too low to make sense for me. On the risk side, the major peril potentially is a selloff in Bitcoin. If the price of the coin itself falls materially, the value of Riot's holdings will decline, in addition to the margins it produces while mining. The bull case, then, is predicated upon Bitcoin prices remaining high (and ideally moving even higher). If that doesn't happen, Riot's break will likely be to the downside on the price chart. Rising network difficulty is the other potential headwind, as we know that rises quite sharply over time. Riot has plans in place to combat this, which we looked at, but planning on something and executing on something are totally different. If Riot cannot execute properly on its growth plans, that's another derailer for the bull case. In addition, rising difficulty brings with it potential margin issues, as outlined above. Overall for me, however, I'm seeing a lot of bullish signs, and I'm sticking to my Strong Buy rating predicated upon the factors I listed above.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4680695-riot-platforms-is-too-cheap-to-ignore?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/24864182.jpeg

Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF is a small ETF but also among the strongest-performing funds in the last year - shares have returned 100% since March 2023. BLOK's holdings include non-profitable companies and those that are richly valued, while the ETF's expense ratio is high. I spot a key area on the chart to monitor as bearish seasonal trends get underway. It's that time in the cycle. The bitcoin halving, which takes place every four years, is set to occur next month. It's a process in which the rewards miners receive for verifying and adding transactions to the blockchain are cut in half - fewer bitcoins are then created, which is seen as positively impacting the supply/demand dynamic. Historically, this has been a bullish catalyst for investors in the world's largest cryptocurrency. Perhaps as a result, we have seen strong returns so far this year in Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, and the like. What's more, individual companies exposed to digital currencies have seen tremendous rallies over recent months, generally trouncing even the stout returns of the S&P 500. I have a hold rating on the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK). I see the high-momentum fund as richly priced and at a key juncture on the technical chart. Halving Ahead: Bitcoin and Related Stocks in the Spotlight eToro According to the issuer, BLOK invests at least 80% of its net assets in the equity securities of companies actively involved in the development and utilization of blockchain technologies. Blockchain is a peer-to-peer shared, distributed ledger that can track tangible, intangible, and digital assets, and companies in all business sectors through the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network. Despite rapid appreciation over the past six months, BLOK remains a small ETF with just $750 million in assets under management. It also carries a high 0.95% annual expense ratio , which makes me uneasy from a long-term portfolio-holding perspective. It's also not a fund that caters to income-hungry investors given a low 0.95% trailing 12-month dividend yield . Risk metrics are another sore spot - BLOK's standard deviation is a whopping 46% as of March 24, 2024 - that's about three times that of the S&P 500, to put that in context. But liquidity metrics are healthy as investors play the ETF - average daily volume is north of 300,000, though its 30-day median bid/ask spread is 0.15%, so using limit orders during less liquid periods of the trading range is prudent. BLOK's largest holdings are either non-profitable on a trailing basis or trade at elevated earnings multiples. Bigger picture, the fund has mixed exposure across the Morningstar Style Box - there's 38% exposure to large caps and the portfolio leans to the growth side while just 24% is considered value. So, there is actually some size and style diversification here, but I still expect the ETF's holdings to generally move together based on how bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies perform. BLOK: Non-Profitable & Richly Valued Holdings Morningstar Bigger picture, 55% of BLOK is comprised of Financials sector companies. It's really a next-generation fintech portfolio with small exposure to non-tech-related industries. With the top 10 positions accounting for 40% of BLOK, there's a decent amount of single-stock diversification compared to some of its peers. The largest holding, CleanSpark (CLSK) is 5% of the ETF. BLOK: Holdings & Dividend Information Seeking Alpha Seasonally, April and May are poor months for BLOK, though its track record only dates back to early 2018. More bullish price action has historically taken place in June and July, so being patient with establishing a position in the fund could be wise over the next several weeks. BLOK: Bearish April-May Seasonal Trends Seeking Alpha The Technical Take BLOK has been a remarkable winner since early last year. With shares having doubled from a year ago, I see potential trouble on the chart. Notice in the graph below that the $37 to $40 range has been a key battleground between the bulls and bears since 2021. The fund found buying support there on pullbacks during the cryptocurrency craze three years ago. Then, in early 2022, the ETF fell under $39, plunging to a low under $30. Rally attempts to $37 failed, and the fund sunk further into its bear market. A low below $15 was notched late in the year, and the long-term 200-day moving average then inflected higher by last summer. Today, BLOK finds itself right back at ""the scene of the crime,"" as technicians say. It's also close to the 50% retracement point from the late 2021 high to the December 2022 low. The trend is clearly higher, but I anticipate a pause at current levels based on this apparent resistance range. Moreover, take a look at the RSI momentum oscillator at the top of the chart - it's printing a lower high while price advances. That's a bearish divergence which could portend a price pullback. There's trendline support in the low $30s while $32 to $33 has been a critical area, too. Overall, BLOK's price is trending higher, but with the fund back near resistance, taking profits here makes sense. BLOK: Revisiting Key Resistance, Bearish RSI Divergence Stockcharts.com The Bottom Line I have a hold rating on BLOK. I like that the trend points to longer-term upside, but a high expense ratio and pricey portfolio, along with technical resistance on the chart are concerns.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4680691-blok-bitcoin-halving-resistance-in-play-amplify-transformational-data-sharing-etf-btc-crypto?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/24863795.jpeg

BKCH is highly concentrated, with 55% of the fund held in just three names: Coinbase, CleanSpark, and Marathon. The fund is well-constructed for a direct and volatile bet on Bitcoin but carries significant risk and is not a long-term investment. The rally in alt-coin OG Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has taken the world by storm (again). We're in the midst of a massive bull run and crypto-related stocks and ETFs are flying once more as well. One way to take advantage of a Bitcoin-related bull market is to own themed funds that are designed to take advantage of higher Bitcoin prices, like the subject of this article. That fund is the Global X Blockchain ETF (BKCH), which is a highly concentrated (i.e.: non-diversified) fund that owns companies that it believes benefit from increased adoption of blockchain technology. Now, in practice, this means the fund is extremely Bitcoin-heavy, including miners, hardware, and digital asset transactions. It seeks to track the Solactive Blockchain Index, which you can read more about in the fact sheet . The end result of all of this is a list of less than 30 holdings for the fund, but even more interesting is that 55% of the fund is held in just three names. When I said it was non-diversified, I really meant it. Fund website The top holding, Coinbase (COIN), is obviously the big player in crypto exchanges, and trades quite closely correlated with Bitcoin itself. CleanSpark ( CLSK ) and Marathon ( MARA ) are two big miners of the coin itself, so it's a completely different way to gain exposure to Bitcoin than Coinbase. The rest of the top 10 is littered with miners, and also - kind of strangely - includes a small position in AI legend NVIDIA (NVDA). Looking at the holdings, I think BKCH is honestly well constructed for what it wants to be, which is a very direct and volatile bet on Bitcoin. If that's what you're looking for, I think you can find that here. Before we look at the technical picture, I'll note that the annual expense ratio is about half a percent, so it's modestly priced given it's an active fund. Second, the risk profile is unsurprisingly high. Annualized volatility is ~76% right now, about 6X that of the S&P 500. This isn't a buy-and-hold fund you get for your grandkids; this is a trading vehicle that is very useful for riding crypto bull markets and carries with it significant risk. With that out of the way, let's dig into the price charts to get a sense of where we may see this thing go. Another breakout incoming? That's the big question, and if I had to make a guess right now, I'd be shocked if we don't see it. Whether it happens next week, next month, or whenever is up for grabs. But this chart looks like it wants to go a lot higher, and as we'll see in the component analysis, there's similar behavior from the largest holdings. StockCharts We have a massive ascending triangle forming right now that started with the October low last year. BKCH put in a spike high of $56 in December before getting obliterated and finally bouncing off of $30. It nearly doubled before its next pullback, but importantly, the pullback was really not that close to the trend line. The bulls are eager to keep pushing this higher, and so long as that up-sloping line holds, I see no reason we don't get a breakout. The PPO histogram is now positive again, and the PPO itself turned higher before even testing the centerline. Everything looks good if you want to be long. Finally, the correlation to Bitcoin itself is somewhat surprisingly low at +0.74 but is still quite positive. That obviously makes sense, but it's certainly not a direct replacement for owning Bitcoin itself by any means. I'll note the relationship was actually negative for a brief time last year so strange things can happen. Big holdings support higher BKCH prices Let's now take a brief look at the three biggest stocks in the fund, which make up the ~55% we looked at earlier. First up is Coinbase, which actually made a new closing high on Monday with Bitcoin-related stocks flying once again. Coinbase has been on an absolutely incredible run, bottoming at $70 in October, and trading for ~4X that level today. StockCharts I don't actually like the look of the PPO at the moment, but raging bull markets can work through extremely overbought conditions. The correlation to Bitcoin here is nearly perfect at +0.97, so this one is trading basically in lockstep with the coin itself. More on that below where we look at Bitcoin itself. Technically, so long as this one holds the 20-day EMA, which is all the way down at $234 but rising sharply, it's a long candidate. I'll say out of the three top holdings, this is the one that makes me the most nervous. But a breakout is a breakout, and it's innocent until proven guilty, so to speak. Next up is CleanSpark, which makes Coinbase's ~4X move look like child's play; CleanSpark is ~7X its October price today, adding another 20% to its price on Monday. StockCharts Correlation is really strong on this one as well, at +0.83. Unlike Coinbase, I actually really like the PPO as it's turned higher (quite sharply) at just the right time after some consolidation. CleanSpark threatened a big breakout on Monday but didn't quite get it. Is Tuesday the day we get a new high? Regardless of the answer to that question, I see it as more of an inevitability with the way this one is moving. Lastly, we'll take a look at Marathon, which is the only one of the three that has a Quant Rating of Strong Buy (the others are both Hold-rated). StockCharts Marathon's correlation to Bitcoin has broken down to an extent, as it sits at just 0.38 today. They are normally pretty correlated, but Marathon is in one of those periods where the relationship breaks down. At any rate, the PPO is bouncing, but below centerline support so it's less bullish than CleanSpark for that reason. However, we also have an ascending triangle in Marathon, so the same principle applies; any price over that trend line is good for a long candidate. Before we wrap this up, let's take a glance at the coin itself to see what clues we can glean. StockCharts We have what appears to be the recipe for a big breakout coming, with price coming nowhere near the upsloping 50-day SMA, and the PPO turning sharply higher well above the centerline. It is my opinion it is just a matter of time before we see Bitcoin breakout and go much higher, but we'll have to wait for confirmation. This chart, for what it's worth, continues to look extremely bullish to me. The bottom line If you're still with me, you're probably pretty bullish on Bitcoin. I happen to agree, as I've been saying for some time. There will be periods of selling, although it may not feel that way with the way the coin has rallied recently. If you're looking to take advantage of Bitcoin's price action in a way other than owning the coin, I think BKCH is a good choice depending on your goals and risk tolerances. This one is risky ; make no mistake about that. It makes massive moves in both directions, offers big rewards if you're right, and big losses if you're not. Use stops to limit downside risks, and take profits on the upside. I like the setup of BKCH on the chart, as well as Bitcoin itself, and even the larger components of the fund. But that guarantees us nothing, so please be prudent if you decide you want to take a position. I like BKCH right now enough that I'm putting a Buy on it. So long as we don't get any major price breakdowns as noted above, I think this is going a lot higher after it makes the breakout over the $56/$57 double top.

42391090,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69beUlz5,1711533600,How Sam Bankman-Fried's Sentencing Hearing May Play Out,"Sam Bankman-Fried will find out this week if he is potentially facing decades in prison. Judge Lewis Kaplan is set to sentence him for his conviction last year on two fraud charges and five conspiracy charges tied to the operation and collapse of FTX.  A Presentence Investigation Report, compiled by a probation officer, recommends a 100-year sentence. Attorneys for Bankman-Fried suggested 63 to 78 months. The Department of Justice urged 40 to 50 years, a proposal the defense called ""disturbing"" and ""medieval.""  Bankman-Fried isn't likely to face anywhere nearly as long as 50 years, let alone a century in prison. Lawyers I spoke to before his trial began estimated he might spend around two decades in prison if he was convicted. Additional lawyers I spoke to over the past week loosely agreed with that estimate, saying 20 to 25 years seems likely.  And, of course, Bankman-Fried and his team will almost certainly appeal the ""guilty"" verdict a dozen jurors handed down nearly five months ago.  You're reading The SBF Trial, a CoinDesk newsletter bringing you daily insights from inside the courtroom where Sam Bankman-Fried will try to stay out of prison. Want to receive it directly? Sign up here.  The presentence report, which was compiled by a probation officer, summarizes Bankman-Fried's background, the case and how the facts of the case fit into sentencing guidelines.  Broadly speaking, Judge Kaplan's sentence will need to take into effect what are known as 3553 factors. This will include a defendant's history, background, upbringing, education, physical and mental condition, the facts of the case, any harm to potential victims and what kind of message the sentence might send to other individuals who might be considering or have the potential to commit similar crimes, said David Weinstein, a partner with Jones Walker.  This defendant's history includes any criminal record (or lack thereof), any charity work they may have done, if they were abused or compelled to do things, if they have ""an emergent family situation"" that might lead to their committing crimes and other similar background factors, said Tama Kudman, a partner at Kudman Trachten Aloe Posner.  Beyond the presentence report and the prosecution and defense submissions, the judge might take into account the character and victim statements provided by the parties.  Presentence report  The presentence report itself ‚Äì which isn't a public document ‚Äì recommended 100 years, according to the defense submission last month. It provides Bankman-Fried's history ‚Äì the upbringing and background details mentioned above ‚Äì to the judge, alongside the calculation of the figure.  However, this figure is based purely on consulting guidelines, Kudman told CoinDesk.  ""This was a mechanical calculator, not that Probation is necessarily saying 'we think you should sentence him for 100 years,'"" she said. ""What Probation is saying is 'in consulting guidelines, this is the conclusion, this is the numerical calculation.'""  However, the defense is arguing that the calculation is wrong, pointing to a lack of actual losses by the victims based on FTX's bankruptcy estate estimation that creditors may be made whole or nearly whole. The prosecution is, to put it mildly, pushing back against that characterization, pointing to FTX creditors who are waiting to actually get any of their holdings back. Those creditors submitted dozens upon dozens of letters saying they suffered hardships because they couldn't access their funds for the last year and a half.  The judge already has a firsthand impression of the case from hearing all the witnesses testify during the trial, said Martin Auerbach, of counsel with Withers Bergman.  ""He will read all of the various impact statements and all of the letters in support and conclude where they fit in the landscape of how he assesses the defendant, how he assesses the offense,"" he said. ""What he thinks the most appropriate sentence is to reach the three goals of sentencing, which are [a] punishment that fits both the crime and the defendant; general deterrence, so that other people understand that they shouldn't do anything like this in the future; and specific deterrence to make sure that the defendant doesn't repeat the offenses for which he has been convicted, or anything like that,"" Auerbach added.  Judge Kaplan may also determine whether Bankman-Fried has shown remorse or accepted responsibility for the crimes he was convicted of and weigh that in his sentencing decision, Auerbach said.  Another factor might be ""whether the judge thinks that [Bankman-Fried] testified truthfully,"" he said. ""In my experience, nobody likes to feel that somebody has come into their space and lied, and if the judge concludes that that's what happened, that has to weigh in the equation.""  The DOJ alleged ""perjury"" in its sentencing submission, trying to nail the idea that Bankman-Fried was not fully truthful when testifying in his own defense last October.  Prosecutors will often claim that a defendant's testimony was perjury if they claimed they were not guilty but ultimately found guilty, Weinstein and Kudman said.  Guideline questions  Auerbach and Kudman both also noted that sentencing guidelines ‚Äì which are no longer mandatory ‚Äì can rapidly increase the length of a sentence due to how they're designed.  The guidelines can skew a sentence ""in ways that don't necessarily track with the severity and nature of the offense,"" Auerbach said.  They also don't account for differences in intent. If one defendant is pocketing their customers' funds and another is just trying to invest those funds for their customers and loses the cash, the guidelines treat them the same even if the underlying intent is different.  ""In truth, but for crypto winter, it might be that FTX would have sailed through the rough patches, and no one would have been the wiser,"" he noted.  Kudman similarly said that given cryptocurrencies' volatility, victims' values can oscillate pretty quickly.  ""Those qualitative differences are important,"" she said. ""They're being obscured by these loss amounts.""  She also noted that the guidelines were adopted decades ago, while inflation and other factors have ballooned the values thrown around during fraud cases over the past several years.  Outside statements  Both the defense and prosecution submitted a number of letters to support their arguments. The defense filed several letters from Bankman-Fried's friends and family, attesting to his character to argue he could become a productive member of society after being released from his brief stint in prison.  Prosecutors, on the other hand, filed letters from FTX creditors who wrote about losing their savings and having to replan parts of their lives around their losses ‚Äì directly pushing back against the defense narrative that there were no losses. Bankman-Fried's defense team filed a handful of additional letters on Tuesday. This latest salvo came from the mother of an FTX creditor, as well as several people who said Bankman-Fried may have ""some type of atypical neurological processes,"" leaning on repeated statements that he has exhibited signs of autism. Also, he's vegan (a point already made in previous letters).  ""In January 2024, my son was contacted by an entity overseeing the disbursement of FTX client funds ‚Ä¶ the hope that customer funds will be reimbursed in some measure mitigates the severity of Sam's guilt, and it seems to me that the length of his sentence should reflect this fact,"" said a letter signed by someone identifying herself as the mother of an FTX creditor.  Judge Lewis Kaplan, when he makes his decision at the end of the hearing Thursday, will weigh letters like that one, alongside the dozens of other messages, as part of his calculus. While the judge might allow statements from Bankman-Fried, FTX creditors or others during the hearing, he may base the bulk of his decision on the existing written record.  ""There's a tension between the desires of the victims to see people punished and what's at risk for a defendant, and as a society, we have to ask where do we think the emphasis should be placed? There's always a balancing act between punishment, rehabilitation and determining all of the issues that we're trying to balance,"" Kudman said.  ‚Äî Nikhilesh De  What we're expecting  Welcome back to a limited-run issue of this newsletter. We'll be here through the rest of this week for sentencing.  Tomorrow, we're back in court for the actual sentencing hearing. Lawyers I've spoken to estimate the hearing could be as brief as an hour or take most of the day, so who knows long we'll actually be there. Depending on how Judge Kaplan decides to approach the hearing, we may hear from FTX customers, friends and family members of Bankman-Fried or the man himself.

Further roll-out of the company‚Äôs prime brokerage product, Galaxy One, is viewed positively.  Broker maintains its buy rating on the stock and its C$17 ($12) price target.  Galaxy Digital (GLXY), the crypto financial services firm headed by Michael Novogratz, had a strong end to 2023 with solid operating results across its diversified business, broker Canaccord Genuity said in a research report on Wednesday.  Canaccord notes that while the fourth quarter was solid, commentary about the performance of the Toronto-listed business through the end of February was even better.  Positive highlights include an almost doubling of assets under management (AUM) from year-end to more than $10 billion, equity capital growing to over $2.1 billion versus about $1.5 billion at the end of the third quarter, and quarter-to-date income before tax of around $300 million, the report said.  ‚ÄúAlso, importantly, Galaxy continues to evolve its business model focused on institutional trading,‚Äù analysts led by Joseph Vafi wrote, adding that ‚Äúwe were pleased to see further maturation and rollout of the company‚Äôs unique crypto-specific prime brokerage product, Galaxy One.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWe view the continuing evolution of Galaxy One to be a real driver of not taking but creating market share as more traditional asset managers look to make some allocation to crypto,‚Äù the authors wrote.  The crypto firm‚Äôs increased relationship with the FTX estate drove a material increase in AUM in the asset-management unit since the end of the year, Canaccord said, adding that higher AUM results in increased trading revenue over time as FTX sells its digital assets at spot prices.  Exchange-traded fund (ETF) activity is also a tailwind. Canaccord said it is ‚Äúquite encouraged by ETF rollouts with European partner DWS both in bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}} as well as the gradual ramp-up of the U.S. BTC ETF with partner Invesco.‚Äù  The broker maintained its buy rating on Galaxy shares with an unchanged C$17 ($12) (price target.

Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett, through a post on X (formerly Twitter), unveiled insights suggesting growing institutional intrigue towards a Litecoin ETF. Terrett shared, ‚ÄúSCOOP: Hearing rumblings on the institutional level about possible interest in a Litecoin ETF. The logic is that because of LTC functional similarities to BTC, the SEC may be more inclined to approve it, possibly even more so than ETH.‚Äù Why A Spot Litecoin ETF Could Be Possible This statement comes at a pivotal time as the crypto market continues to navigate through regulatory uncertainties and growing interest from traditional financial institutions. Adding to the buzz, Terrett highlighted recent actions by the Coinbase Derivatives to launch futures contracts for Dogecoin, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash, all set to begin on April 1st, 2024. Related Reading: Litecoin Beats Out Dogecoin, Bitcoin To Emerge As Top Crypto For Payments These futures contracts, as detailed, are part of Coinbase‚Äôs strategic move to diversify its offerings, leveraging the self-certification approach under CFTC Regulation 40.2(a). This approach permits entities to launch new products without the explicit approval of the CFTC, provided they comply with the Commodity Exchange Act and accompanying regulations. Moreover, the recent classification of Ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC) as commodities by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in its lawsuit against KuCoin has added another layer of legitimacy to the discourse surrounding Litecoin‚Äôs regulatory standing. The CFTC‚Äôs action emphasizes its view of certain cryptocurrencies as commodities. Amidst these regulatory clarifications and developments, discussions about the potential approval of a spot Litecoin ETF have intensified. Luke Martin, a renowned crypto analyst, echoed the sentiment, suggesting that the approval of an Ethereum ETF could pave the way for other ‚Äúold altcoins,‚Äù like Litecoin, which may have a stronger case for not being classified as securities. Related Reading: Litecoin Whale Deposits Big To Binance, LTC‚Äôs 3% Drop To Extend? He stated, ‚ÄúWhen the ETH ETF launches and passes, the question then becomes especially with the SEC‚Äôs track record versus tokens there‚Äôs other dinosaur old altcoins which you can make almost a stronger case [that] they‚Äôre not a security, one that sounds ridiculous but if you think deeply about it, it‚Äôs true ‚Äì Dogecoin you could probably prove easier is not a security than ETH.

Spoke with @zhusu a few weeks ago about this exact scenario, and the unique trading opportunities that come with a $DOGE ETF. pic.twitter.com/tlyFgDvUhR ‚Äî Luke Martin (@VentureCoinist) March 21, 2024 Adding to the momentum, Alan Austin, Managing Director at the Litecoin Foundation, expressed enthusiasm about the prospects of a spot Litecoin ETF, stating, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll say it again, love or hate ETFs, the first company to launch a Litecoin ETF is going to crush it!‚Äù LTC Price Is Lagging Behind Despite the current buzz, Litecoin‚Äôs price analysis indicates that it is still down by 77% from it‚Äôs all-time high in May 2021, signaling a bearish trend in comparison to other cryptocurrencies that have already surpassed their 2021 peaks. Nevertheless, a recent break above the 200-week EMA has ignited a glimmer of bullish momentum. Overcoming the red resistance zone between $102 and $106 could be critical for Litecoin to reach new heights, with the $128 mark (0.236 Fibonacci retracement level) as a potential near-term target.

On Tuesday, the token‚Äôs price approached its all-time high (ATH) level of $19,92, reaching above $19. APT Eyes $20 Milestone Despite the recent price correction across the broader cryptocurrency market, Aptos‚Äô APT token has been on an impressive uptrend since early March. Over the past 30 days, the token has surged by more than 94%, showcasing its strong performance. Aptos has also gained recognition in crypto, climbing to the 23rd position among the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Currently valued at $7.3 billion, the token has experienced a substantial increase from the $4 billion recorded at the beginning of the month. Related Reading: Ripple CEO Responds To SEC‚Äôs Shocking $2 Billion Demand The trading volume of Aptos (APT) has seen a significant surge, reaching $542,531,437 in the last 24 hours, a notable 90.70% increase from the previous day, according to CoinGecko data. Analyzing the daily APT/USD chart, no significant resistance levels are observed, indicating that reaching the $20 milestone may be within reach, which would mark a new all-time high for the token. The sustainability of the bullish momentum and the ability of investors to hold on to their gains will play a key role in determining the coin‚Äôs future performance. Nevertheless, a possible retest of the next support level at $17.36 cannot be ruled out in the event of profit-taking and selling pressure. If the $17.36 support level fails to hold, the next significant support level for APT is at $16.31. However, it is important to note that APT‚Äôs bullish structure remains intact as long as the $12.14 support level remains unbroken, suggesting that the bulls currently have the upper hand as long as a sharp 30% decline does not occur. Aptos Attracts 11 Million Tokenholders In 30 Days Coupled with the increase in the price of its native token, Aptos has seen significant growth in key metrics over the past 30 days. According to Token Terminal data, token holders have grown significantly, increasing by 3.4% to 11.79 million individuals over the past 30 days.

42391134,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69beXV9x,1711499400,Binance Is Having an Odd Time,"Binance is having a weird moment, perhaps most clearly illustrated by the fact that a national government detained two of its executives for a month now ‚Äì and one is only free because he seemingly escaped custody.  You‚Äôre reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Tax evasion  The narrative  Nigeria and the Philippines have recently cracked down on Binance in extremely different ways, while what used to be Binance in Russia is shutting down.  Why it matters  Binance has been the poster child as the target of governments' ire against the crypto industry. Actions like last year's joint U.S. Department of Justice, Treasury Department and Commodity Futures Trading Commission settlement against Binance support the thesis that Binance hasn't played within regulatory guidelines in the past. And then there's whatever is going on in Nigeria.  Breaking it down  It's been a bit of a weird time for Binance. Two executives had been detained by a country that appears to be grasping for reasons to keep them there (one has since escaped, possibly with a fake passport). In the meantime, a handful of other countries have cracked down on the exchange.  Over the weekend, the operator of what used to be Binance's Russian platform, CommEx, announced it would start shutting down services in the country over the next several weeks.  Meanwhile, the Philippines' Securities and Exchange Commission published an order announcing it would block Binance in the nation, saying it ""poses a threat to the security of the funds of investing Filipinos."" This follows a warning from the regulator last November.  And, of course, there's Nigeria, which a month ago detained two Binance executives ‚Äì Tigran Gambaryan and Nadeem Anjarwalla ‚Äì without announcing any charges against either individual. Gambaryan is a former U.S. Internal Revenue Service investigator who heads financial crimes enforcement compliance at Binance, while Anjarwalla is a dual national of the U.K. and Kenya. Anjarwalla has since escaped under odd circumstances, while Gambaryan is still detained.  The Record published a comprehensive summary of the situation earlier on Tuesday.  The U.S. and U.K. governments are aware of the detentions, statements from their respective agencies said in statements to CoinDesk reporters.  A U.S. State Department spokesperson told CoinDesk the entity was ""aware of reports of the detention of a U.S. citizen in Abuja, Nigeria,"" while a spokesperson for the U.K.'s Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office said, ""We are supporting a British man detained in Nigeria and are in contact with the local authorities.""  A spokesperson for the Kenyan government's counterpart could not immediately be reached. A White House spokesperson didn't return requests for comment.  The executives were detained ostensibly because the government blamed Binance for its ongoing currency crisis. According to The Wall Street Journal, which was the first outlet to identify the executives, the two were initially not charged with any crimes. After Anjarwalla's reported escape, Nigeria charged Binance, Gambaryan and Anjarwalla with tax evasion ‚Äì four weeks after first confiscating the executives' passports and placing them under house arrest.  ""When a U.S. citizen is detained overseas, the Department works to provide all appropriate assistance,"" the U.S. State Department spokesperson said. ""Due to privacy considerations, we have no further comment.""  A spokesperson for Yuki Gambaryan and Elahe Anjarwalla, Tigran and Nadeem's wives, told CoinDesk earlier this month that they were not yet aware of any specific actions taken by the various governments.  ""They have received a lot of information from the families and we know that they've been in touch and they are aware of what is happening,"" they said. ""But as far as we know, with regards to specific actions that they have taken with their Nigerian counterparts, we're not aware of anything up to now.""

Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap Has Returned To Neutral Levels CryptoQuant Netherlands community manager Maartunn explained in a post on X that the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap has declined back toward the neutral line. The ‚ÄúCoinbase Premium Gap‚Äù here refers to a metric that keeps track of the difference between the BTC prices listed on cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase (USD pair) and Binance (USDT pair). Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Returns To Extreme Greed As BTC Breaks $71,000 When the value of this metric is positive, it means that the price listed on Coinbase is greater than that on Binance right now. Such a trend implies that the buying pressure on the former is higher than that on the latter platform (or alternatively, the selling pressure on there is just lower). On the other hand, a negative value can imply the selling pressure on Coinbase is higher than on Binance as the price of the cryptocurrency listed there is lower. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap over the past few days: The value of the metric appears to have been close to the neutral line recently | Source: @JA_Maartun on X The chart shows that the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap had taken to notably positive values as the latest upward push in the asset‚Äôs price had occurred. Since then, though, the metric has fallen, with its value approaching zero. It would seem that the buying pressure on the platform contributed to the surge. The fact that the rally has slowed since the metric returned to neutral levels may add further evidence. This isn‚Äôt unnatural for this year, however, as the Bitcoin price and Coinbase Premium Gap have shown a pretty tight relationship since the start of 2024. Coinbase is popularly known as the preferred platform of American institutional investors, while Binance hosts more global traffic. As such, the premium‚Äôs value provides insight into how the behavior of the US-based large holders differs from that of world users. Since the Coinbase Premium Gap has been the driver of the recent price surges, buying from these institutional entities could potentially have provided the fuel. Related Reading: Bitcoin Top In Yet? What The Legendary MVRV Ratio Says As the indicator‚Äôs value has now neared the neutral mark, it would imply that these whales have lifted their foot off the gas. Given the close relationship the metric and BTC price have held recently, it may be worth keeping an eye on how things develop in the coming days. BTC may register some decline if the premium flips into the red from here. Naturally, a continuation of positive values would be a bullish sign instead.
