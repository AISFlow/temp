42383642,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9xwWj,1589050820,I'm Still Betting on Blockchain to Improve Economic Opportunity,"Jed McCaleb is co-founder and Chief Architect of the Stellar Development Foundation, an open network that connects the world’s financial infrastructure.      When I started working in this industry, I was motivated by the idea that I could help build something to tangibly make people’s lives better. I could build a network that connected financial systems in a way that would be useful for the world. Because despite the advancements that technology and the internet have brought us, the global payment landscape hasn’t kept pace. At its best, today’s system is slow, cumbersome, and fraught with fees. At its worst, it leaves millions of people marginalized. A decentralized system could be a way to empower people with greater access to financial services that are fast and affordable.    Jed McCaleb is a speaker at Consensus: Distributed, CoinDesk's free virtual convention running May 11-15. Register here.    I was clear-eyed that the kind of systemic change I envisioned would take time. Challenging the existing financial providers to see the value in connecting to decentralized infrastructure, educating policymakers and regulators about the benefits of this new technology, and then actually building a network with businesses that demonstrates valuable network effects, is a monumental challenge.      Today, we’re at an important moment for this industry. While China launches a national blockchain platform, others in the world are slowly tapping into the potential this technology has to offer. But the last few weeks and months have acutely demonstrated how useful – and arguably necessary – this technology is. Holes in the system have been visibly exposed as people suddenly find themselves urgently needing to send money or financial support to family and friends all over the world. Even governments, like in the United States, realize that they lack the infrastructure to quickly issue payments to millions of citizens in need. It’s a reminder that the opportunity for blockchains to create a better, more efficient system is worth fighting for.    Like the internet democratized access to information, I believe this technology should democratize access to the financial system.    As I prepare to take the virtual stage at Consensus: Distributed to talk about the evolution of cryptocurrencies, I thought about the fact that, while a lot has changed in the decade I’ve worked on this technology, the core ideas that make this technology compelling remain constant.      Here is why I think blockchains are (still) the answer to how we build a more dependable, accessible and connected world.    It promotes interoperability and inclusion    A blockchain allows seemingly disparate systems to connect even though they don't have a formal relationship with each other. While this might not sound very exciting, the socioeconomic impact is enormous. Because this connection means a world with over 180+ different monetary systems could work together on a single platform. That represents billions of people in the world being able to seamlessly transact and interact.      That’s a huge improvement over today’s system, which is essentially patch-worked together. Of the hundreds of different monetary systems, each has its own unique set of services and connections to the parallel systems outsides its borders. All of these disparate banks, money transfer operators, and treasuries combine to make up the entire global financial system as we know it.      But imagine a world where you had almost instant access to carry, spend, or send a digital dollar, a digital yuan, a digital peso, any currency in your wallet, no matter the geographical location of your bank. Blockchain technology enables that speed and access, allowing systems to be interoperable and connected. When that happens, it creates access, opening the door to financial inclusion for so many who are marginalized today.    Decentralization creates opportunity    As more financial institutions, companies, and developers come onto a blockchain network, it creates opportunity by leveraging the benefits of decentralization to create compelling network effects. The total power as a stable, secure, transparent network grows.      Stable because the network persists and synchronizes regularly because it is spread over servers and computers all over the world. It doesn’t rely on a central server so a truly decentralized network can’t be turned off. Secure because no one can change the numbers or manipulate the data to their liking. Transparent because everyone can see the ledger and trust the information is correct.      And maybe most importantly, unlike a centralized system with a predictable growth curve which can compromise relationships to users and their data, decentralized systems can grow organically, permissionless-ly, and exponentially. It takes time to build network effects (as I’ve witnessed first hand over years in the industry) but once it takes off, the opportunity will be endless.    Consensus can be sustainable    There are different flavors of the consensus algorithms used to maintain a blockchain and this means the speed, cost, and functionality on different blockchain networks varies. I feel strongly that the best way to build an interoperable, decentralized network is through an open-source protocol that’s sustainable. Much like the internet democratized access to information, I believe this technology should democratize access to the financial system. Open source will let us do that, because the network as a protocol isn’t driven by profits or shareholders. And, importantly, there are consensus protocols, like the one we’ve built for the Stellar network, that don’t demand huge energy resources to run. The Stellar Consensus Protocol is sustainable, using a small amount of energy.      When blockchain development is led in this way, it enables even greater functionality on a network. We can build it in a way that’s best for the network and for users. That means we can focus on the improvements needed for today’s financial system to make it more equitable and accessible, like making transfers take seconds, rather than days, and cost fractions of a cent, rather than ranging from a few to hundreds of dollars.      I’ve devoted the better part of a decade to building blockchain technology. While we’ve made tremendous progress, as we face today’s crisis, it’s clear we still have a ways to go. Now more than ever, I am motivated by the utility and power of blockchains. For me and our work at the Stellar Development Foundation, blockchains are still the answer to a better, more equitable financial system.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | XLM,Jed McCaleb,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/05/09/im-still-betting-on-blockchain-to-improve-economic-opportunity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bde183845005eb64d0b75a0c02e37611d081713b-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383655,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9xwjJ,1589049858,How to Protect Your Crypto From Cyber Attacks During COVID-19,"The 1997 indie horror movie ""Cube"" posited a dystopic future where unwilling prisoners are systematically dismembered by a high-tech prison. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has created an environment for a similar virtualized dismemberment of our digital assets and our personal data security.      Unscrupulous hackers are socially engineering their way into financial systems and financial accounts. Well intentioned efforts to promote public safety are fostering prospective abrogation of personal data privacy. At the same time, there are new areas of business opportunity for distributed ledger companies emerging from the crisis.      The EventBot trojan is the latest malware to target financial accounts and wallets. Posing as an innocent-seeming app download, such as Microsoft Word, it will take over your phone’s data streams, keylogging passwords and even grabbing SMS messages used in two-factor authentication.      Malware and phishing are on the rise in the pandemic, as hackers take advantage of heightened anxiety and unprecedented numbers of people working from home outside normal corporate security protocols. For example, one attack vector is to send a phishing email that simulates a health alert from an individual’s organization. Another is to engage in synthetic identity theft on LinkedIn with fake profiles of real people that then send internal LinkedIn messages containing links asking people to look at a file or app. The next-level LinkedIn hack is account takeover of a legitimate profile, and I have personally seen this happen with at least two colleagues in the last six weeks.    David Shrier is a speaker at Consensus: Distributed, CoinDesk's free virtual convention running May 11-15. Register here.    Meanwhile, new data security risks are emerging as unintended consequences of the massive effort to track, trace and remediate the virus. Large-scale health data pools are being assembled, with multiple copies of sensitive health, financial, and telecom data being created at disparate locations. The audit trail of who has accessed this data is poor. Distributed ledger solutions around data governance, data security, and personal data management could help. For example, BurstIQ has announced the Research Foundry to facilitate secure collaboration around health data.      Synthetic identity theft is another cyber security issue that’s accelerating in recent months. Hackers will take elements of data about real people, such as their name and social security number, and combine it with fake information such as a fingerprint image, a new email address, and street address, to create a convincing simulacrum of a real person that can be used to open credit lines, divert funds from financial accounts, and other forms of fraud or theft. Distributed ledgers offer possible solutions on synthetic identity theft, with the potential for distributed digital identity creating a trusted substrate for identity verification, validation, and authentication. Essential data attributes can be linked immutably to each other, and the blockchain trust authority can offer assertions around authentication and transactions tied to this immutable identity without revealing underlying personal data.    Cyber unicorns will be founded in the next few years as we see ever-increasing demand for better security solutions.    To secure your crypto wallets and other accounts, here are a few steps you can take:      1. Enable multi-factor authentication. According to Microsoft, 99.9% of compromised accounts did not have multi-factor authentication activated.    2. Use a different password for every single account you have. Many people re-use the same five passwordshttps://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Ponemon-Authentication-Report.pdf (notwithstanding the fact that the average business user has over 190 logins to track).    3. Use good password hygiene: the world’s most common passwords last year included “12345” and “password,” with 83% of Americans using weak passwords.      4. Make sure your virus software is up to date, including installing protection on your phone. Android represents 98% of mobile phone attacks, mostly in the form of malware downloaded to the device.      5. Practice good cyber hygiene. Only download apps from credible repositories, like the Android Marketplace, and verify sources before clicking on any link you receive in an email, text, or LinkedIN message.      Escape the “Cube,” and explore the cyber opportunity that has also arisen as a result of the pandemic.

42383618,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9xqIV,1589032800,"Scams, Schemes and Crypto Privacy, Feat. Preston Byrne","CoinDesk reporter Leigh Cuen is joined by attorney Preston Byrne, a partner at the Washington, D.C., office of Anderson Kill, to talk about schemes, scams and constitutional rights.      For daily insights and unique perspectives listen or subscribe to the CoinDesk Podcast Network with Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pocketcasts, Google Podcasts, Castbox, Stitcher, RadioPublica, IHeartRadio or RSS.    This episode is sponsored by ErisX, The Stellar Development Foundation and Grayscale Digital Large Cap Investment Fundhttps://grayscale.co/coindesk.    “There is really very little difference, at least in the point of origin...whether something is a scam,” Byrne said, regarding inaccurate blogs and representations of software projects. “Take Ethereum, for example. Ethereum had all manner of promises that were made...the statements coming from the Ethereum Foundation were somewhat more measured.”      Regardless of whether any particular project is an attempt at fraud, it’s likely that online money schemes of every variety will become more common during this coronavirus crisis. According to Thomas Papageorge, head of the Consumer Protection Unit at the San Diego District Attorney’s office, there’s a “clear pattern” of more white-collar crimes since the recession began.      “The rate of incidents, the amount of fraud, does increase dramatically during an emergency situation like this,” Papageorge said. “I’ve heard about new types of scams that involve cryptocurrency … investment scams and bogus advice about protecting your savings or bitcoin.”      Bitcoin evangelist Andreas Antonopoulos tweeted that fraudsters were impersonating him to offer unemployed people fake jobs, identity thieves looking for personal information. Likewise, CoinDesk impersonators are also targeting people across the sector.      See also: Why the Dollar Has Never Been Stronger or More Set Up to Fail      According to Carnegie Mellon University economics professor Sevin Yeltekin, the financial stressors people are experiencing today make them “more vulnerable to those scams.” However, there is a silver lining, she said, because businesses that survive the current recession will do so because they reimagined how they operate, including “risk management.”      Even tech-savvy people like Lisa Gus, startup investment lead at the Government Blockchain Association and co-founder of the startup WishKnish, can be vulnerable to fraudsters in such stressful times. Gus said she spent several weeks being led on by a scammer impersonating a Binance employee before her startup’s security solution MetaCert identified a phishing domain behind the fraudster’s email account, support@communitybinance.org.      “About LinkedIn, I’m not the only one being inundated with fake [investment] offers...the amount of propositions I’ve been getting [is up],” Gus said. “Especially for larger companies, it’s impossible to track profiles that are associated with them.”      With regards to this instance, a LinkedIn spokesperson recommended members “take precautions” in these trying times and “report any messages or postings they believe are scams to us so we can investigate.""      Larger companies often charge early-stage blockchain projects for working together, whether it’s cited as marketing costs or listing fees. In Gus’ case, the fraudster had due diligence paperwork and non-disclosure contracts, which made the scammer’s request for a bitcoin deposit less suspicious.      As for retail users, ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees has “definitely seen more phishing attempts” since early March. Likewise, a Binance spokesperson said so far in 2020 the company saw an average of 180 scam reports per month, which dwarf the unreported instances. So the exchange offers a public verification tool to check whether websites, phone numbers, emails, Telegram and WeChat handles are actually affiliated with Binance.    That’s why the blockchain explorer Etherscan launched the “ EthProtecthttps://info.etherscan.com/ethprotect/” program in April, to tag wallet addresses reportedly used for fraud. Etherscan CEO Matthew Tan said the company uses internal “circuit breakers” to minimize false positives and aims to provide users with “actionable data” to make “informed choices” about who they transact with.    See also: Udi Wertheimer on Cypherpunk Myths and Bitcoin in Real Life      As for the attorney Byrne, he said in some cases cryptocurrency projects may run afoul of consumer protection issues, even if they are not considered unregistered securities, frauds or scams.      “There’s a range of representations of things, what you can say about things, that aren’t necessarily true but aren’t fraudulent,” he said.      The fact is, cryptocurrency now exists. People will use it unethically, the same way they do with all other forms of money. But there are lawful and constructive ways to use the technology as well.      “You can operate a bitcoin business in a regulatory compliant fashion,” Byrne said. “However, it requires a lot of work and advice and design to do that correctly.”      Want more?

42383620,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9xqNX,1589030026,"The CoinDesk 50: Bitmain, the Behemoth of Bitcoin Mining","Founded in 2013, the Beijing-based Bitmain Technology remains at the center of the crypto economy. With its flagship AntMiner bitcoin mining equipment still dominating the hardware market and its mining pools accounting for about a quarter of the Bitcoin network’s computing power, it retains a uniquely powerful place in the ecosystem of by far the largest cryptocurrency and blockchain project.      That’s not to say it isn’t also controversial. Its vocal support for a Bitcoin hard fork (Bitcoin Cash) in 2017, following contentious community disagreement, won the company, and its masterminds, many enemies.    This post is part of the CoinDesk 50, an annual selection of the most innovative and consequential projects in the blockchain industry. See the full list here.    Over the years, Bitmain has been involved in many controversial developments to the point that the Chinese crypto community refers to its foes as the “mining avengers.” In 2017, Bitmain filed a lawsuit against Yang Zuoxing, the former design chief behind Bitmain’s AntMiner S9 who started a rival miner manufacturer MicroBT, over patent infringement. But Bitmain lost the case eventually.      Then in 2018, it brought another lawsuit over non-compete violation against the former creators of Bitman’s mining pool BTC.com, who left the company to start a rival service PoolIn, which has become the world’s top two bitcoin mining pool by total hash rate.      Bitmain’s story started with Wu Jihan, one of the earliest bitcoin evangelists in China, translating Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper to Chinese in 2011.      He invested in probably the world’s first known bitcoin-denominated initial public offering in 2012. It was a project started by Jiang Xinyu, a.k.a Friedcat., who was crowdfunding bitcoin to roll out an application-specific integrated circuit just for bitcoin mining.      The hardware sold well initially and sensational success followed. In 2013, Wu, with a finance and psychology degree from China’s prestigious Peking University, decided to start his own company to manufacture mining hardware. He was joined by Zhan Ketuan, his partner on the technology side, who, in six years, would find himself ousted from the company in a coup started by Wu.      Bitcoin’s last halving event in the summer 2016 marked the beginning of two years of extraordinary growth at Bitmain.      In 2017 alone, still only four years old, it made $1 billion in profits. It made another $1 billion for the first six months in 2018 and then went on a high-profile fundraise in the summer, netting $700 million from external shareholders with a bet. The deal is this: if Bitmain can’t go public within five years since the fundraise at an agreed term, external investors could require the company to redeem all of their investment with an interest.      At that time, Bitmain was boasting a hardware market share of nearly 80 percent. So the agreed term for the IPO was nothing but ambitious: raising at least $500 million at a valuation of no less than $18 billion.      So much has changed in 2019, since its first IPO attempt failed in March in Hong Kong.      Its rising rival, MicroBT, whose founder won over Bitmain’s patent infringement lawsuit, is seriously undermining Bitmain’s market dominance.      In 2019, Bitmain’s mining pools BTC.com and Antpool lost the top two spots to F2Pool and Poolin, the latter of which still has an ongoing case with Bitmain over alleged non-compete violation.      When Wu Jihan returned in a coup in November 2019 to kick out his founding partner Zhan, he told his people he’s back to save the sinking ship. Whether his tough comeback will work as he expected is yet to be proven, although it appears prepared to roll out more powerful equipment to weather the upcoming halving.      It remains to be seen if Bitmain can replicate the sensational success it once had following the 2016 bitcoin halving.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BCH | MARKET | MINING | FORKS,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/05/09/the-coindesk-50-bitmain-the-behemoth-of-bitcoin-mining,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e8482e8bcfbea046468de7e7218382bdde583f83-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
