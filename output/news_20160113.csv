42378528,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iXcj,1452723522,Marqeta CEO: Blockchain Tech Isn't Just a 'Flash in the Pan',"“Bitcoin was a darling, now it’s the underlying blockchain.”  That’s the perspective of the payments industry toward the distributed financial technologies space, according to Jason Gardner, CEO of payments-as-a-service provider Marqeta.  The startup, which raised $25m in October, was one of the earlier payments firms in the space to experiment with digital currency, working with Ripple on a defunct debit card product that would have allowed users to spend cryptocurrency at traditional points of sale. Marqeta touts a cloud-based and API-driven processing platform for online and offline payment types – attributes that have so far attracted names like Facebook and Oink as clients.  However, the CEO was keen to note that he sees blockchain as part of a larger trend that finds payments firms, including card networks like MasterCard and Visa, increasingly opening up once-proprietary platforms to open-source technology.  Gardner told CoinDesk:  ""When you see big banks like JP Morgan, IBM and Microsoft creating new technologies using blockchain, I don’t think it’s just a flash in the pan. I think people are realizing the efficiencies open-source tech can bring.""  As for his support of the industry, Gardner says he doesn’t believe one iteration of the technology, whether it’s Ripple’s consensus ledger, the bitcoin blockchain or another alternative, will win out. The larger goal that interests his peers, he says, is the faster movement of money.  ""It's the goal,"" Gardner said. ""That helps us run our business more efficiently.""  Still, Gardner reports that Marqeta’s strategy toward the emerging technology has shifted over the years, even though its team remains ""big believers"" in bitcoin and blockchain.  Whereas before it sought to emerge as an early adopter, Gardner indicated his company is now content to let larger financial players develop products that allows Marqeta to tap into what he considers to be the big opportunities in the space.  ""Two years ago, building card products that would authorize against an alternative currency ledger was very, very new, and with the banks and the card networks ... it was very hard to get that stuff approved,"" Gardner said.  Members of the Marqeta team have since gone on to found Shift, which this year partnered with Coinbase for the launch of its bitcoin card product that could be used at traditional points of sale.  Blockchain observation  Gardner admits that ""bitcoin is on the backburner"" as his company enters 2016. Over the next four quarters, the startup will emphasize on-demand services, expense management, alternative lending and virtual card products.  That’s not to say Marqeta isn’t actively following developments in the blockchain industry. According to Gardner, the company still intends to be ""front and center"" on working with networks and banks on applications of the technology.  Marqeta, Gardner says, is interested in how banks are connecting with distributed ledger service providers such as Ripple and how the industry more broadly is building new ledgers that increase the speed and efficiency of money movement.  The reason, according to Gardner, is that Marqeta deals with payments inefficiencies it believes could one day become a thing of the past.  ""When a card is swiped, we see the transaction in real time. We see the $40 worth of food, we see it happen,"" Gardner explained. ""[But] sometimes we don’t know when the money will arrive [from networks]. Money doesn’t move in real time, it’s batched and moved in one big chunk to banks.""  The result is that this creates an accounting burden for Marqeta and its services, one he said would be simpler on a shared ledger system.  Decade away  Despite his optimism about the tech, Gardner expects any mass rollout of blockchain or distributed ledger systems for public transactions to be slow.  ""It's waiting for the market, which is moving very slow. The size of ecosystem and amount of banks involved, it's going to take a long time,"" he said.  Gardner expects it will be at least 10 to 15 years before banks are ready to make this leap due to the somewhat convoluted way in which the current transaction system currently operates and the natural risk aversion of these institutions.  Even this estimate, though, he said was ""aggressive"".  ""You could have a card that is issued by a bank in Japan that has a Visa logo, but if that’s swiped at a different terminal, [money] flows differently. You have all these interconnected networks that would have to move to adopt blockchain,"" he continued.  Still, he argued that the transition should be pursued if blockchain tech becomes the key to moving money faster global, concluding:  ""It needs to happen, nothing has changed around settlement for too long.""

42378524,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iXVB,1452713709,Russian Payments Firm Trials Bitcoin Tool for Customer Verification,"A Russian payments service is testing a notarization tool based on the bitcoin blockchain as a way to assist in its customer onboarding.  The tool, outlined in a blog post from startup Tierion, was developed for Pay-Me.ru, a mobile acquiring firm based in Moscow and founded in 2012. BlockNotary, which developed the app, is a customer of Tierion's, using its technology as the backend for the project.  According to the post, the tool would replace an existing process for verifying Pay-Me.ru customers, who are now required to sit for in-person interviews before being shipped the firm's point-of-sale product.  Instead, customers can take part in a video interview by way of a mobile app. A timestamp record of the data collected is then placed on the bitcoin blockchain.  BlockNotary founder Igor Brainov, who demoed the tool earlier this week at an event hosted by startup accelerator Plug 'n Play, told CoinDesk work on the tool began in November.  Pay-Me.ru CEO Vladimir Kanin said that the company is looking to deploy the tool for validating new customers.  ""This kind of digital know-your-customer (KYC) procedure must improve quality of compliance and prevent potential risks,"" he said, adding:  ""After [a] short period of time we [are] planning to expand this option to our operations on Kazakhstan, Ukraine and others markets.""

42378525,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iXWR,1452709318,Tickets for $1.5 Billion Powerball Jackpot Now Selling for Bitcoin,"Mobile lottery ticket app JackPocket has officially integrated bitcoin payments into its offering, a move that allows users to buy Powerball tickets, both for tonight’s $1.5bn jackpot and future prizes, with bitcoin.  The announcement comes as the Powerball jackpot climbed to a record $1.5bn today, creating what would be the largest lottery prize ever distributed in the US. Launched in 2015, JackPocket offers a mobile app that allows New York residents to play lotteries including Powerball, Mega Millions and three New York state lotteries.  In a Medium post, CEO Peter Sullivan framed the move as part of the startup's mission to reduce friction in the lottery purchasing process, adding that his team is ""very bullish on cryptocurrencies and the blockchain in general"".  Sullivan wrote:  “Our goal at JackPocket is to create a more efficient lottery platform … Utilizing Bitcoin is one step in right direction to accomplishing our goal.”  Sullivan also hinted that JackPocket has been experiencing difficulties with its payment systems due to ""large volumes"" and ""heavy regulation"", forces that he said put pressure on its relationships with credit card processors, acquiring banks and card networks.  Further, the CEO suggested that the move would potentially attract more affluent and tech-savvy consumers to buy more lottery tickets, while positioning the startup to take advantage of micropayments, a long-debated but still developing use case for the technology.  Jackpot works by scanning copies of real lottery tickets for users, orders that are fulfilled by employees who physically buy the tickets. Users who win more than $600 have tickets are delivered to so prizes can be claimed.  Notably, the company’s investors include Digital Currency Group, the investment vehicle owned by noted bitcoin enthusiast Barry Silbert.

42378520,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iXQ9,1452707144,Bitcoin Group Cleared to List on Australian Securities Exchange,"Australian bitcoin mining firm Bitcoin Group is scheduled to make its long-delayed debut on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) in early February.  Reports state the firm will list under the code 'BCG' with the aim of raising AU$20m ($13.9m) via the sale of 100 million shares at an issue price of 20 cents. The close date for the IPO is now January 25, while trading is expected to commence on 2nd February.  The news comes over a year after the Melbourne-based company first announced its intention to list in October 2014.  The process has since been held up following a reprimand from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) in February and two stop orders on its investor prospectus in July.    In one incident, the firm got into hot water with the regulator following a post on social media platform WeChat aimed at gauging interest from investors over the IPO. Various changes have also had to be made to the firm's prospectus.    Following final revisions to Bitcoin Group's filing in December, the way is now supposedly clear for the initial public offering (IPO) to go ahead.  Once, approved Bitcoin Group would join digitalX (formerly digitalBTC) as the second bitcoin firm to have secured a listing on the ASX, the largest exchange in the Australian market.

42378513,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iXL7,1452703685,PayPal Adds Bitcoin Startup CEO to Board of Directors,"Xapo CEO Wences Casares has been appointed to PayPal’s board of directors, the pioneering online payments firm announced today.  The former founder of digital wallet firm Lemon Inc, acquired by LifeLock in 2013, Casares would go on to launch bitcoin security startup Xapo, which has raised more than $40m in two public funding rounds.  In the official release, PayPal lauded Casares for his past entrepreneurial efforts and position as a “cryptocurrency thought leader”.  While he did not cite bitcoin specifically, Dan Schulman, president and CEO of PayPal, aimed to position Casares as an addition to the team that would help the company with its forward-looking initiatives.  Shulman stated:  “Wences’s unique line of sight into the future of commerce is ideally aligned with PayPal’s vision of transforming the management and movement of money for people around the globe.”  Though Xapo remains one of the most high-profile firms in the industry, it did see its star dim somewhat in 2015 amid a lawsuit by online identity firm LifeLock, the previous employer of Casares and four other members of its executive team.  LifeLock has argued that the defendants “spent months” developing Xapo while employed by LifeLock and using LifeLock resources. Xapo would later file a cross-complaint.  As of 4th January, Xapo had successfully argued that the case should be moved from California to Argentina, as the work was done by “Argentine citizens”, a motion granted by Judge of the Superior Court Peter Kirwan that effectively halts case developments.

42378519,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iXOt,1452691421,Japanese Think Tank NRI Considers Expanding Blockchain Research,"A leading Japan-based think tank is considering ways it could build on its existing exploration of blockchain technology.  First announced in late 2015, Nomura Research Institute (NRI), an affiliate of Nomura Holdings, is already working on private proof-of-concepts (P0Cs) with Nomura Securities and SBI Sumishin Net Bank (SBI Sumishin). The Tokyo-based firm is exploring the technology’s use cases in Japan, a region where there have been relatively few blockchain industry developments.  In a new interview with CoinDesk, Kazumitsu Yokokawa, head of the financial services research and technology group at NRI America, said:  ""Blockchain could be used for many industries, including retailers and enterprises, and we are interested in exploring these.""  Yokokawa said NRI sees a business case in exploring blockchain tech given the demand by groups like Nomura and SBI Sumishin for research into applications in securities and banking.  Still, he inferred NRI is looking at these partnerships strategically as it seeks to gather its own expertise in the subject area.  ""The purpose of these PoCs is to come up with practical ways to use blockchain in the future for these industries beyond financial industry.""  Bridging interests  For its part, NRI sees itself as an enabler of exploration in the industry due to its ability to identify ""innovative blockchain vendors"" and to coordinate between these groups and more established financial organizations.  ""Blockchain study requires both innovative technologies and financial knowledge. SBI Sumishin, Dragonfly Fintech and NRI as a team will provide these essential elements of industry knowledge and cutting-edge technology for blockchain PoC,"" Yokokawa said.  Following the completion of its initial PoCs, Yokokawa said NRI will make its own determinations on how to move forward with the program.  For now, however, he stated that the firm is comfortable with its leadership position in the space, concluding:  “We are the first and only one [working with blockchain] in the securities market in Japan. In the banking industry, we are also early adopters.""

In a new filing submitted to the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Ulbricht's defense – which declared its intent to appeal in June – argued that the court hid key evidence, particularly the actions of federal agents Carl Mark Force IV and Shaun Bridges amid the US government's investigation of the Silk Road.  The defense also questioned the legality of some of the searches and seizures conducted during the federal investigation, and said that Ulbricht's rights to due process and a fair trial had been denied.  Ulbricht  was sentenced to life in prison in May after being convicted in February of last year. He was found guilty of narcotics trafficking, money laundering and computer hacking charges.
