42378648,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7kwrn,1457277656,Why Bitcoin Startups Have the Right to Innovate,"Mark Toohey is a commercial lawyer who has worked as general counsel in the media, telecommunications, software and IT industries. At Adroit Lawyers, his clients include bitcoin and blockchain firms that have had difficulties securing bank accounts.  In this opinion piece, Toohey discusses these issues, calling for both the banking industry and government to accept that digital disruption is inevitable in the finance and banking sectors.  Sometimes we ask the wrong question and miss an important opportunity.  The recent strident demands for an investigation into alleged collusion by Australian banks against bitcoin businesses was misdirected.  The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) investigation found the banks did not collude when they closed down the accounts of a number of a number of bitcoin businesses.  In fact, the ACCC found that one bank had decided not to deal with digital currency businesses back in 2011. Another bank made a similar decision in 2015. They also found that other banks are continuing to deal with bitcoin businesses on a case-by-case basis.  Allegations of collusion will always be difficult to prove. Assembling sufficient evidence to back such a serious claim is a hard task. That is the implicit nature of collusion – it is usually something hidden or off to the side.  In this instance, the facts cited by the ACCC don’t lend much support to allegations of collusion.  Disruption threat  The banks do have a serious role to play. Any reasonable person accepts we live in a perilous era when preventing money laundering or terrorism financing is important.  The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) must be watchful and banks have a mandatory obligation to report and prevent any improper activity. Few would not wholeheartedly support those actions.  On the other hand, there is no doubt the banking industry is threatened with massive disruption. Banks clearly recall how the music and television industries were savaged by technological change.  Now digital disruption is knocking on their door, they are wasting no time reacting.  Banks worldwide are moving to stave off this looming threat. Over 40 banks have banded together to form the R3 consortium. Their collective aim is to forge a new system for inter-bank transfers using new technology.  Imbalance of power  A far more important issue should have been considered by the regulators. How will the important and legitimate rights of smaller FinTech businesses be protected?  The four goliaths of Australian banking wield enormous power. Collectively the banking industry represents around 30% of the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX).  Over in the other corner, there is a motley band of ambitious FinTech ventures in desperate need of funding. It has to be one of the most imbalanced struggles in modern commerce.  Entities that count their profits in billions are up against teams with great ideas, a good grasp of technology and a few coins rattling in their pockets. If Australia is to be an innovative nation, this imbalance must be addressed. It is absolutely crucial that FinTech businesses have a right to compete  In a few short years there will be winners and losers. A handful of concepts will dominate. It is possible a Google-like business will emerge victorious and revolutionise the way money is transferred, stored, loaned or invested.  Perhaps that business will emerge from a bank-funded innovation lab. It may even be a more renegade outfit.  There is a slight chance it could even be an Australian idea. But, there is a chance that great initiatives could be crushed. With or without collusion, the Australian banks can too easily eradicate competition.  There is a case for government intervention. It is absolutely crucial that FinTech businesses have a right to compete. They must be given a right to innovate and, however unsettling it may be to the status quo, an inalienable right to disrupt.  When challenged, the music industry fell back on copyright law to protect its fortress. We all know how that ended up. It is now abundantly clear that they should have accepted the inevitable and swiftly changed their business models. They fought to defend the indefensible for way too long.  Call for change  There are huge lessons here for the banking industry.  It is quite possibly in the bank’s own best interests that they be restrained from any ‘inadvertent’ or indiscriminate retaliation when business threats emerge in the near future.  The power of a bank to arbitrarily close the accounts of competing businesses must be limited. There is a clear case for a swift and effective review process when closures occur.  A bank account is central to any FinTech business. It is their oxygen. There must be swift and effective ways to resolve issues. They can’t survive weeks or months. They need a way to have an account closure independently and immediately considered and adjudicated. When warranted, the account must be promptly reactivated.  The time for government action is now.  While I have candidly stated my views, this is not some anti-banking establishment rant. I am not suggesting anything untoward has happened or may happen in the near future.  Instead, it is a call for both the banking industry and government to ride the inevitable wave of digital disruption that is about to wash through the finance and banking sectors. It is also a call to remember the music industry’s Alamo. We need brave and daring business leadership and wise regulation.  Winners and losers  Australian technology must be given the opportunity to take root and succeed. If the right environment is not permitted or created we will all soon being using foreign technologies to manage our banking and investments with the rewards flowing offshore.  Rapid and drastic changes will increasingly confront the financial system. Technology will deliver new tools and concepts. There really is no other option, but to move swiftly and wisely.  We are on the brink of an era of great peril and great potential. There will be some massive winners and many more devastated losers. Rich rewards may flow to those who are agile, strategic, invest wisely and swim with the tide.  This article was originally published on the Accelawrate blog and is republished here with permission.

42378649,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7kwt3,1457274343,Decentralized Apps: Key Questions from a Bank Innovation Director,"Alex Batlin is senior innovation manager at UBS's FinTech Innovation Lab, and the leader of the Swiss-based financial firm's Crypto 2.0 Pathfinder research into blockchain technology.  In this opinion piece, Batlin gives a personal view of how decentralized apps run a greater risk of centralization than hardwired protocols like bitcoin.  For the last few months, I have been grappling with a gut feeling that somehow Ethereum’s smart contract-based distributed application (dapp) model has a different dynamic to that of hardwired protocols like bitcoin or Ripple.  This week that feeling has crystalized into a semi-coherent thought.  Hardwired protocols do not have a separation of concern between the protocol and business logic. The same set of protocol designers, software developers and miners control how the emergent distributed autonomous organisation (DAO) functions.  It’s different for dapps – there is a clear separation of concern between the protocol and business logic encapsulated in the smart contract.  The dynamics of how a dapp-based protocol evolves can be similar to bitcoin, yet very different for dapp themselves. They can have a clearly attributed owner, such as the person or organization that wrote the smart contract, the person who uploaded it or the individual who charges a fee for it’s use.  Centralisation risk  This presents an unexpected, to me at least, risk of centralization.  Sure, the protocol may be distributed and hence the operation of the dapp is also distributed, but if many other dapps use a unilaterally controlled shared smart contract, then at least at the logical level you get back to a centralised model, which in some cases you may wish to avoid.  This is not necessarily an issue if managed well.  Highly shared smart contracts could be recognised as key infrastructure components and be formally owned and managed by some form of open software foundation (OSF), be that the Ethereum Foundation or some other body. The key here is that there should be no confusion about who owns the smart contract and what obligations they have.  Alternatively, you could write 'mirrored' smart contracts to mitigate centralisation risk. For example, let's say two parties need to track bilateral obligations, each would deploy their own instance of the smart contract, and each instance would track nostro and vostro views of obligations.  Technically this is less efficient as you are double tracking data, but it does offer a simpler ownership model.  That said, there is no reason why smart contacts cannot be privately owned, even if highly shared, as long as they provide unique value and users fully understand associated risks. Assuming that the contract owner fixes fees in code, price hike risk is mitigated in the on-chain world when compared to traditional intermediation business.  Welcome to the 'Dapp Store'  Once you start charging fees for use of your dapps, you have to be clear what you are charging for. Are you charging for the license to deploy an own instance of a smart contract and use of the dapp wallet – a bit like buying an app from an App Store? Or for a service provided by an already deployed smart contract?  Arguably, since it is really the miners that provide the service of actually executing and validating the transactions, it’s hard to justify charging a service fee for smart contracts, unless there are many value-add off-chain services bundled together with the dapp.  Based on that assessment, we may end up with a 'Dapp Store' model, where folks purchase a license to deploy an instance of a well-written, standards-compliant, tested and proven dapp onto a blockchain.  This however implies that the dapp creator does not provide operational guarantees, so who does?  There are parallels today, for example, iOS developers rely on Apple to provide the device, the OS and the App Store, and both rely on the broadband and mobile Internet service providers (ISPs) to provide connectivity. However, none of them guarantee entire front-to-back service to the app user.  New entity required  The conclusion therefore is that a new type of entity is required – a blockchain service provider (BSP). Essentially, this is not today’s bitcoin or Ethereum miner or validator equivalent, but one that provides guarantees and maintains full nodes that can be used by lightweight end user wallets.  The BSP is likely to be running on a Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) cloud compute platform, such as Microsoft’s Azure platform is already supporting multiple blockchains.  Such a construct is required to have clear legal responsibility for the entire supply chain. An end user must formally accept the terms and conditions of the dapp wallet, the dapp smart contract and the BSP.  Multiple interconnected BSPs will be required to provide adequate level of trust, which will be higher than one provided by a centralised service, since no single participant is able to alter any part of the system unilaterally.  In other words, a blockchain business is a trusted business. You then will need to decide if you need the enhanced trust or not for your specific use case.
