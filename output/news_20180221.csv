42401139,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLn2f,1519253137,"Venezuela's Cryptocurrency Is Here, But Who's Involved Isn't Clear","There's a flurry of information coming out of Venezuela this week about its new national cryptocurrency, the petro, though a full picture of the project has yet to emerge.  Indeed, despite the press conferences and Twitter campaigns, one of the notable questions to emerge about the first-of-its-kind cryptocurrency is exactly who is building it, which technologies are being used and which private companies are involved (if any).  Perhaps most notable among those named in the latter category is a relatively little-known consulting firm called Aerotrading, which describes itself as ""the biggest blockchain consulting company"" on its official website.  The social media push from the Venezuelan government highlighted the agreement with the consultancy, and has included photos of its representatives meeting with the country's president, Nicolas Maduro.    El Presidente Nicolás Maduro sostiene reunión con representantes de la empresa Aerotrading LTD #AlFuturoConElPetro#Independencia2018 pic.twitter.com/i6RgFfqgjg        — Director de Conatel (@JorgeEMarquezM) February 20, 2018      A Twitter account  linked to Aerotrading has several tweets posts, all from today, including one that reads: ""We are pleased to welcome the #Petro cryptocurrency to the #blockchain ecosystem.""  Yet questions remain, including what role exactly the firm will play in the launch and use of the petro. Emails sent to addresses associated with Aerotrading were not returned by press time.  As previously reported, Maduro unveiled the ""petro"" back in December, and on Tuesday the government launched a presale which it claims has raised a whopping $735 million on the first day. Still, the sale was reportedly marred by confusing messaging, and political figures in the country have decried the move as illegal.  NEM says no involvement  One group that has confirmed that it is not involved with the petro is the NEM Foundation, which oversees development of the open-source NEM protocol. The NEM Foundation was first linked to the story after documents published by the Venezuelan government indicated that the NEM network would be used as the platform on which tokens would be issued.  ""The NEM technology is freely open to any individual or organization that wants to use it. The NEM Foundation abstains from political endorsements. We can confirm that the Venezuela Government is intending to use the NEM Blockchain,"" the group said in a statement posted to Twitter.  A representative for the Foundation told CoinDesk in an email that the group ""is not involved with this project and we're not in a position to control any open source projects.""  ""The NEM Foundation has a clear purpose to introduce, educate, and promote the use of the NEM blockchain technology platform on an international scale to all industries and institutions,"" the rep added.  Confusion over the Foundation's involvement was sparked by a tweet from the Venezuelan government that inaccurately cited them as meeting with officials there. Chatter on social media suggests that the exchange in question is ZeusExchange, which is based in Russia.  When reached for comment, a representative for the exchange suggested that its code would be utilized in connection with the project.  ""The part of Zeus Exchange code will be used for the future crypto exchange and as a part of NEM Blockchain Alliance to all Mercosur countries, Venezuela included,"" the rep said.  Other links uncertain  Information about other groups reportedly linked to the petro project is less clear at this time.  According to a source, the team behind Venezuela-based cryptocurrency exchange MonkeyCoin is among those rumored to be involved. MonkeyCoin was launched in June 2017, according to press statements at the time, and emails sent to the exchange were not returned by press time.  A December report from news service El Cooperante links an additional cryptocurrency project, the loan platform OnixCoin, to the petro initiative. As the site reported on Dec. 13, OnixCoin ""is in charge of carrying out the generation of Venezuelan cryptocurrencies.""  Additionally, as reported by Reason that same month, OnixCoin founder Angel Salazar is part of a group that is advising the Venezuelan government on cryptocurrency regulation.

42401133,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLmun,1519245304,US Government Arrests Bitcoin Stock Exchange Founder,"The owner of BitFunder, a long-defunct, bitcoin-denominated stock exchange, has been arrested by the U.S. government.  The charges against Jon Montroll, also known as ""Ukyo,"" were unveiled today by the U.S. Justice Department following an investigation that involved the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC is pursuing civil charges against Montroll in a separate action, alleging that he operated an unlicensed securities exchange and defrauded investors.  Montroll was arrested Wednesday, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office Southern District of New York.  The details of the cases date back to an earlier period in bitcoin's history when websites like BitFunder – a kind of stock exchange for cryptocurrency companies – were more common. BitFunder was shuttered in late 2013, and acted as a kind of companion service to cryptocurrency exchange WeExchange.  As laid out in the Department of Justice's complaint, BitFunder was the target of a hacking effort that enabled those behind the attack to credit themselves funds. This resulted in the withdrawal of roughly 6,000 bitcoins from WeExchange, rendering the services insolvent.  Prosecutors allege that, in November 2013, Montroll ""provided sworn testimony to the SEC's New York Regional Office in connection with their investigation into the Exploit and BitFunder's activities."" As part of that testimony, he submitted a balance statement which reflected ""the total number of bitcoins available to BitFunder users in the WeExchange Wallet as of October 13, 2013"" that amounted to roughly 6,700 BTC.  Yet that balance sheet statement constituted ""a misleading fabrication,"" the Justice Department said Wednesday, alleging:  ""Contemporaneous digital evidence, including chat logs and transaction data, revealed that the Balance Statement was a misleading fabrication. Three days into the Exploit, [Montroll] had participated in an internet relay chat with another person (""Person-1"") in which he sought help in tracking down ""Stolen coins."" When that did not work, [Montroll] transferred some of his own bitcoin holdings into WeExchange to conceal the losses. The Exploit, however, continued. By the time of the Balance Statement, WeExchange actually held thousands of bitcoins less than [Montroll] had asserted through the false Balance Statement.""  Montroll is accused of further misleading SEC staff after being confronted by SEC investigators, according to statements.  ""While [Montroll] admitted that the Balance Statement was the product of his manual intervention in the WeExchange system, he claimed to have discovered the success of the Exploit only after the SEC had asked him about it during his first day of testimony and to have no knowledge of the chat with Person-1,"" the Department said.

42401145,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLn4d,1519239936,What Venezuelans Are Saying About the Petro,"Social media has been abuzz since Tuesday's initial sale of the forthcoming Venezuelan government-backed cryptocurrency, the petro, though reviews are so far mixed.  So far, Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro has claimed that the country had collected a whopping $735 million during the first day of its presale for the new cryptocurrency. In spite of a lack of proof, the claim came amid a splashy, nationally-televised broadcast where Maduro himself declared that the country has ""taken a giant step into the 21st century.""  Venezuela’s government first unveiled the petro back in December, setting up a dedicated government agency to oversee the development of the project and build up an ecosystem for it within the South American nation. In anticipation of the sale, the government published a white paper, a buyer’s guide and, most recently, newly crafted rules for creating cryptocurrency exchanges within Venezuela.  The initiative has sparked a range of tweets in support – and in opposition – to the idea, buoyed by a dedicated hashtag, #AlFuturoConElPetro (which translates to ""to the future with the petro"").  For instance, one advocate tweeted, ""The new economic era for Venezuela begins. The newborn criptomoneda called el petro has many challenges ahead, but its armoring will be the potential for the progressive regularization of the economy.""  Perhaps unsurprisingly, members of the country’s National Assembly – which is controlled by political parties in opposition to Maduro – have blasted the move, including in statements issued just hours after Tuesday’s broadcast event.  Among those taking a public stance against the petro is Marialbert Barrios, a National Assembly deputy who asked: ""Who in their right mind buys a [cryptocurrency] from a government that does not pay the foreign debt, with an economy in hyperinflation?""    ¡Ahora van a querer pagar las deudas con ""petros""! para tratar de darle vida a ese invento que en verdad es una emisión de deuda externa sin autorización de la @AsambleaVE. ¡Cuidado con los vendedores de humo!        — Marialbert Barrios (@MarialbertBs) February 21, 2018      The pushback from the Assembly comes amid an acute political standoff between opposition forces and the Maduro government. According to Reuters, opposition parties are expected to boycott an upcoming presidential election in April, which they argue is rigged in Maduro’s favor.  Deputy Rafael Guzman called the cryptocurrency ""fraudulent,"" reiterating past arguments that it will fuel illegal activity.  ""[The] petro is a fraudulent, illegal and invalid mechanism for the government to continue its shady business and money laundering, because it is not known where those resources will come from,"" he wrote.  Base of support  In contrast with the denunciations from the opposition-controlled Assembly, various offices within the Venezuelan government have used their social media presences to boost agencies that promote the petro.  Among those is SENIAT, Venezuela’s tax and revenue authority, which claimed that residents can use the petro to pay their tax liabilities, among other things.    El Petro será canjeable por dinero fiduciario y otros criptoactivos a través de casas de cambio digitales. El Estado aceptará el pago de impuestos, obligaciones, tasas, contribuciones y servicios públicos nacionales en Petro. #AlFuturoConElPetro pic.twitter.com/80puSYsmbb        — SENIAT (@SENIAT_Oficial) February 21, 2018      ""The state will accept the payment of national taxes, duties, fees, contributions and public services in petro,"" the agency wrote.  Mariana Ribera of Infocentroshttps://www.cnti.gob.ve/til-venezuela/sector-ti-venezolano/proyectos/formacion/infocentros.html, which operates a network of IT centres throughout Venezuela, also celebrated the move on Twitter.  ""This initiative, this new South, gives us an endless range of options and opportunities in the national and international market, opening new Horizons that have no limits,"" she wrote.  Other tweets in support of the move include those from the Venezuelan consulates in Hong Kong and Vancouver.  Maduro’s official Twitter account has seen a number of related posts in the past day, including one from Wednesday afternoon that played back footage from Tuesday’s broadcast.    Estamos dando un paso gigante hacia la nueva economía y el futuro. ¡Sintámonos orgullosos del nacimiento del Petro! En los meses que están por venir, el Pueblo tiene una cita con la prosperidad... Con la victoria. #AlFuturoConElPetro pic.twitter.com/G7S1XoVSQt        — Nicolás Maduro (@NicolasMaduro) February 21, 2018      Local bitcoiners raise concerns  Yet, turning back to the opposition, politicians in Venezuela aren’t the only ones pushing back against the idea.  While the skepticism voiced by Venezuelan opposition lawmakers could be seen through the lens of the ongoing political crisis in the country, the critiques put forward by members of the local bitcoin and cryptocurrency community are more nuanced and focused on the fact that the Maduro government will likely wield significant control over the cryptocurrency it's creating.  In a post on a local Facebook group, one commentator wrote that it is ""really worrying"" that the government would exercise such a large degree of control, especially considering the wide-reaching push for people to start using it.  The fear, he said, is that the government will have “the absolute power to manipulate and adulterate the blockchain at will over petro.""  Others aruged the petro isn’t much of a decentralized cryptocurrency at all. ""That’s what makes the petro a debt bond and not a crypto in itself, plus the danger of these guys behind that project,"" one community member wrote.  Yet another observer offered a broader take, posting in the Facebook thread:  “Tyranny is that: [a] monopoly of power in the hands of a political class that only cares about its space.”  Editor's Note: Statements in this report have been translated from Spanish.

That was the message delivered to the heads of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Wednesday by three lawmakers and members of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus (CBC), a bipartisan group launched last year in a bid to support the technology and its interests on Capitol Hill.  Penned by Jared Polis (D.-CO), Tom Emmer (R.-MN) and David Schweikert (R.-CA), the letter does much to repeat the CBC's past public statements, but notably comes weeks after both agency heads testified on cryptocurrencies, explaining to the U.S. Congress what they saw as their potential amid what was then a tremendous spike in their market valuations.  In this way, the letter encouraged SEC chair Jay Clayton and CFTC chair J. Christopher Giancarlo to follow through on efforts to collaborate with the U.S. Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve on legislative actions. The signatories went on to thank the regulators for their testimony, while also advising they maintain a ""light touch"" in their effort.  The letter said:  ""The U.S. should be the home to this innovation, and should embrace these new technologies. In order for these efforts to be successful, it is imperative that we adopt a deliberate, flexible and unified approach to regulation.""  Additional dialogue was given to the question of token sales and initial coin offerings (ICOs), or funding mechanisms that rely on the use of custom cryptocurrencies.  Going forward, new proposed regulation or legislation should be ""narrowly tailored,"" the letter said, so as to balance consumer protection with the need for experimentation and domestic job creation.  Additional steps, it stated, should be taken ""to avoid unnecessary concern and uncertainty,"" concluding:  ""We encourage you to allow continued innovation in the market, and devote more creative analysis into the ways cryptocurrencies can be utilized.""

42401129,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLmsp,1519232450,Crypto Nodes Are One Step Closer to Legal Protection in Arizona,"Proposed protections for cryptocurrency node operators are moving ahead in Arizona's legislature, public records show.  House Bill 2602  , which was filed on Feb. 6 by Representative Jeff Weninger (R.-17), passed the Arizona House of Representatives on Feb. 20 with 55 votes out of a possible 60. The measure will now be sent to the State Senate for further deliberation.  The bill's provisions seek to prevent town and county governments in the state from imposing restrictions on people who run such nodes in their residences, saying that the matter ""is of statewide concern and not subject to further regulation"" in those local jurisdictions.  Weninger's measure does not specify whether it is restricted to cryptocurrency miners, but it does state specifically that individuals using computing power to either validate or encrypt a transaction on a blockchain are protected.  Stepping back, the bill is just one of several making their way through the Arizona legislature. Another bill sponsored by Weninger would formally define the terms ""virtual coin,"" ""blockchain,"" and ""virtual coin offering"" within the state’s legal framework.  If passed, that particular bill, submitted earlier this month, would define when an initial coin offering (ICO) qualifies as a securities offering under existing law.  More significantly, however, is another bill recently passed by the Arizona Senate which would empower the state government to accept taxes in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This bill would, if approved, require Arizona's Department of Revenue to convert the cryptocurrencies into U.S. dollars within a day of receiving them as payment.  This bill was introduced in the Senate by Senator Warren Petersen (R.-12), and Weninger is sponsoring its House equivalent.

42401134,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLmwl,1519228845,Ripple Papers Pledge New Start for $40 Billion XRP,"The startup that oversees development of the world's third most-valuable cryptocurrency, XRP, is moving to upgrade the underlying technology on which it operates.  Announced Wednesday, San Francisco-based startup Ripple is releasing two new white papers for peer review – one describing XRP's consensus algorithm in a more formal way and the other outlining a way to improve the diversity of connections of each node, the software users run to relay and verify transactions on the network.  Taken together, the moves show that Ripple, whose investors include banks like Santander and SBI, is ready and willing to invest in the core infrastructure supporting its cryptocurrency, which despite falling out of favor with the company at times, now secures more than $40 billion in value.  Yet, while XRP has become one of the most in-demand crypto assets, in some ways its development has lagged behind other more established offerings like bitcoin and ether.  Indeed, Ripple CTO Stefan Thomas sought to portray the papers as a step towards developing a tighter relationship between the company's research arm and academia. In short, the startup wants it to be easier for researchers to follow Ripple's technology, so its easier for them to contribute.  In interview, Thomas sought to stress how the papers open up the possibility of further building a network effect around the tech – one that might be key now that traders are buying in.  Thomas told CoinDesk:  ""This is the first time we're releasing peer-reviewed academic papers. Obviously, it opens the door for future research. After this, I expect you'll hear much more about us interacting with academia.""  More broadly, the papers can be seen as perhaps the first attempt in some time for the company to refresh and improve documentation around the open-source platform. (The work is the first since 2014 to detail the XRP Ledger, then called the Ripple Consensus Ledger.)  As such, the papers are also a statement on the continuing evolution of Ripple, which after launching with the goal of repurposing cryptocurrency into a secure payments network is seeking to replace centralized bank messaging and liquidity services with decentralized alternatives.  Playing defense  For Thomas, however, the two releases have one central theme: security.  ""What we're trying to do here is add some defenses against some unlikely attack scenarios. Basically, it says you can't completely manipulate the entire network,"" he explained.  The key word here is ""unlikely."" Thomas argues these attack vectors aren't viable unless the attacker was a state actor, say the U.S. government, with enough money and technological resources to disrupt the network. And though he isn't particularly worried about this happening, Thomas said the startup is trying to protect against those use cases anyway.  ""We're extremely cautious. We want the best security,"" he added.  The first paper, called ""Analysis of the XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol"" builds on the company's 2014 paper, providing a formal, mathematical proof that what's supposed to happen on the network will really happen. It boils down to two things: ""safety,"" that the network won't fork into two competing networks, and ""liveness,"" that the network won't get stuck and will keep processing transactions.  The second paper, ""Cobalt: BFT Governance in Open Networks"" seeks to improve on previous XRP plans with an algorithm that supports a richer array of validators.  You can think of XRP as kind of like a voting system, where each node storing Ripple's transaction history gets a vote on what happens next. To help it accomplish this, each node in Ripple carries something called a Unique Node List (UNL), a list of nodes on the Ripple network that the node considers legitimate.  So, if each node is connecting to a better variety of nodes, the argument goes, that's good for the long-term resiliency and decentralization of the network.  Both papers draw heavily on distributed systems, a body of computer science research describing how large connected networks function. And because they're more theoretical, Thomas stressed these papers will likely have a longer-term impact.  ""It's not going to affect how users use XRP right now. They won't experience any downtime or anything,"" he said.  One step behind  Still, it will remain to be seen if Ripple's developments, including these papers, are enough to allay criticisms of Ripple and its arguably hot-and-cold relationship with XRP. It's worth noting there are some who have been skeptical of its tech from the beginning, and that these criticisms have only grown as XRP has seen more attention.  Critics are often supporters of other blockchains, like bitcoin or ethereum, which seek to use decentralization in a different way. (Some even going as far as to argue the technology ""serves no purpose"" as an alternative to today's global, financial technology.)  Thomas, though, is unfazed by these negative assessments.  In statements, he sought to position critics as out of touch, while remarking that the nature of the technology is that it can improve and respond to market needs.  ""Critics are always one step behind,"" Thomas told CoinDesk. ""When I started at Ripple, all sorts of things didn't happen. It wasn't open-source, we didn't have validators, but over time it's grown and we've been able to accomplish all of these things.""  In this way, Thomas sees the papers as just another way Ripple is responding to market needs, whether that's ensuring it's providing an alternative to SWIFT or that its cryptocurrency is secure.  As Thomas views it, curbing centralization of validation is what they're working on next, even going as far as to argue that Ripple will be ""far more decentralized"" than bitcoin in the future.

42401142,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLn5c,1519218101,A Token to Regulate All Tokens? Messari to Raise ICO,"Some envision an apocalyptic battle between cryptocurrencies and regulators, others foresee blockchain innovations becoming too powerful to be tamed.  But Ryan Selkis, widely known by his Twitter moniker TwoBitIdiot, isn't devoted to either one of these futures. The founder of Messari, a nascent crypto version of CrunchBase, is more measured – thinking there's no reason to panic, but that this isn't a time for complacency, either.  To that end, he announced his solution Tuesday – a crypto token that will seek to protect the industry by pushing it toward self-regulation.  But if a year or more of furiously critiquing ICO practices makes it seem like Selkis is against tokenized crowdfunding, he's not; in fact, his criticism is directed at making sure a good idea isn't ruined by bad behavior.  While self-regulation has been a hot topic in the broader crypto industry for some time, it has yet to see a whole lot of pick-up (besides a very recent development in Japan). But, according to Selkis, regulators have been consistent in their approach toward the nascent industry.  After all, there's no doubt specific regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have taken a keener interest in the crypto token market as of late. And that's why Selkis believes now is the time for his concept to shine.  Selkis told CoinDesk:  ""If we do something like this, it will certainly be this year, because I think the window is closing on the industry in terms of how long we have to essentially self-regulate without top-down enforcement actions really putting a freeze on token activity.""  A new orthodoxy  Stepping back, Selkis first announced Messari in October, at the time calling the project an open-source EDGAR (the public SEC database for securities) for tokens.  In today's announcement, he furthered that concept, describing how other self-regulatory bodies have evolved over time to become significant organizations – citing the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the National Futures Association (NFA).  But precedent aside, it remains unclear just how to get the crypto industry, which is decentralized, global and so inherently hard to pin down, to come together over the issue.  In the announcement, Selkis wrote:  ""I’m confident we could get a decent amount of the way toward self-regulation based on social pressure. But until recently, I didn't really think there were good enforcement mechanisms or financial incentives to make any self-regulatory efforts reliable.""  Looking ahead, he's convinced he found that mechanism through a decentralized list attached to an agreed-upon set of standards, all of which is governed by a token.  The model is called a ""token-curated registry,"" and Selkis acknowledges the idea will only work with broad buy-in crypto's leading luminaries.  Evangelizing disciples  As such, Selkis, who noted that everything about the idea is still ""subject to change,"" outlined his vision for the token in today's blog post.  A token-curated registry is essentially a list vetted by people that hold a token to allow them to control who gets on the list. On Messari's particular list would be compliant projects funded by ICOs.  Selkis expects the vetted voters to be key stakeholders in the industry – the entities (such as hedge funds, exchanges and advisers) that regulators would hold accountable if investor abuse became widespread.  ""As stakeholders, I think there would be intrinsic benefits to owning a stake in a system that greenlights token offerings as abiding by certain minimal levels of transparency and standards,"" he said.  To facilitate compliance, token projects would have to make certain disclosures (currently being developed), such as the critical facts about the token, like the vesting schedule for different groups, commitments to auditing and the token's economics would need to be detailed on the site.  Selkis sees a future where Messari indirectly reinforces good behavior since stakeholders would become reluctant to work with companies that fail to get on the Messari list.  While there's a number of companies that gather smaller data sets about token projects today, most of those services are pay-for-access businesses, whereas Messari would be open.  ""Siloing data and information in this industry is going to be a losing business model,"" said Selkis.  Awaiting scripture  Still, those who have been following the Messari project may have noticed we're still at the idea stage. In fact, the announcement is short on specifics.  There's no hard cap, no soft cap and no vesting terms. We could even imagine a scenario in which Messari used a unique token, like an ERC-721, but it could also be the simple ERC-20. None of that has been finalized.  In fact, Selkis isn't even ready to say what kind of legal structure he expects to employ.  This is part of the process. Most projects have to build technology. Besides that, Selkis has to build something much more delicate: buy in.  ""There's still a lot of research and development to do this right,"" Selkis said.  But the pressure Selkis feels is not from the regulatory community, here or abroad.  ""I think they've recognized the challenges and limitations in coming up with top-down regulations,"" he said, pointing to the recent testimony by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), where the agency's chief stated that rule-making should ""do no harm.""  Selkis added, ""I think they are probably supportive of new technology, provided they are abiding by the spirit of the existing securities and commodities law.""  The pressure he feels, then, is in bringing a truly ecumenical set of voices to the table, a collective powerful enough that new issuers really have to listen, unified around one plan. He explained his deliberate process by saying:  ""We're just not in a rush, because I think this is a one-shot deal to get consensus around.""

Crypto Market Hovers Around $500 Billion,"With bitcoin above $11,000, the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is gyrating around the $500 billion mark – and possibly building a base for a step higher.  As of writing, the total value of all cryptocurrencies around $480 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. The figure has risen by 43.20 percent from the Feb. 6 low of $276 billion. However, over the last three days, the wider crypto market has consolidated in the range of $475 billion to $520 billion.  In the last 24 hours, the total value has dropped by $32 billion as the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap suffered losses.  However, bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency looks set to rally soon, thus the probability of total value of all cryptocurrencies breaching the recent range on the higher side are good.  Bitcoin (BTC) suffered an overnight drop of more than $1,000. Prices hit a low of $10,948.20 in Asian trading hours today, and were last seen at $11,143 – down 3 percent in the last 24 hours.  Still, as reported today, BTC is looking on track to test the long-term inflection point at $12,300 soon.  Further, bitcoin ranks second from the bottom on the list of losers in the last 24 hours among top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.  Litecoin  (BTC) is the top loser today, with 8.96 percent drop in the last 24 hours – a decline could be due to profit taking, given the cryptocurrency has rallied more than 100 percent from the Feb. 6 low of $106.94.  Investors poured money into LTC last week with the hope of making easy money via litecoin cash hard fork. However, post-fork LTC has remained resilient and is continuing its love affair with the 23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement level of $222 on Coinbase's GDAX exchange. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $222.68, according to CoinMarketCap.  Meanwhile, bitcoin cash (BCH) is down 8.69 percent. Its U.S. dollar exchange rate (BCH/USD) witnessed a bullish inverse head and shoulder breakout last week, but lacked the strength to cut through a bigger head-and-shoulders neckline resistance (former support). On Bitfinex, prices fell to a six-day low of $1,322.70 today.  Also, of particular interest is dash. The cryptocurrency has replaced IOTA as the tenth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. It's also the most resilient cryptocurrency of last 24 hours, down only 2 percent, while it ranks third on the list of gainers from the Feb. 6 lows among the top 10 cryptocurrencies.

The Zaif exchange, operated by Osaka-based Tech Bureau Corp., saw the brief glitch last week which enabled traders to make crypto purchases for free, according to Reuters.  As customers realized the situation, a number attempted to make the most of the 20-minute window for free coins. One, according to the Asahi Shimbun, even placed a order for bitcoin worth 2,200 trillion yen ($20 trillion) at the time; then moving to quickly sell it again.  Tech Bureau Corp. announced yesterday that the incident had occurred on Feb. 16, detailing that seven customers had obtained cryptocurrencies at zero cost.  The firm later cancelled the transactions and corrected the users' balances, Asahi indicates. However, a Reuters source suggests that the correction is still being negotiated with one of the seven users who attempted to transfer the free bitcoin away from the Zaif platform.  At least one customer attempted to resell their bitcoin, according to Asahi, but the large amount of cryptocurrency offered soon drew attention, even outside the exchange.  A Tech Bureau official reportedly apologized for the glitch and said the company would take measures to prevent such problems from reoccurring.  The news comes when Japan's exchanges are already under pressure over technical standards after the Coincheck exchange suffered a major hack in January. The country's finance watchdog, the Financial Services Agency, was asked by the government to make inspections at a number of unlicensed exchanges on Feb. 16 to ensure their levels of security are up to par.

The cryptocurrency ran into offers above $11,700 yesterday, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) and fell to $10,691.43 at 04:29 UTC. As of writing, the BPI is back at $11,162 - down 1.5 percent for the last 24 hours.

Furthermore, the cryptocurrency is up at least 85 percent from lows seen on Feb. 6. Still, many in the investor community believes BTC is still in a bear market and the sharp rise from the lows below $6,000 is only a ""corrective rally"" inside the bigger downtrend.  The view has merit, given the cryptocurrency is still trading well below the descending trendline drawn from the Dec. 17 high and Jan. 6 high.

Weekly chart  View  The cryptocurrency remains on track to test the long-term inflection point of $12,300 (trendline resistance).  Bullish Scenario: A daily close (as per UTC) above $12,300 would signal the bear market has ended and add credence to the bullish doji reversal. In such a scenario, BTC could revisit $17,178 (Jan. 5 high) and could possibly break higher towards the record highs around $20,000.  A close (as per UTC) below the upward sloping 10-day MA would signal short-term consolidation.  Bearish scenario: A break below $10,297.39 (current weekly low) would add credence to the bearish weekly chart factors and could yield a drop to $9,017.41 (Jan. 17 low). The sell-off would be more intense if the break below $10,297.39 happens after a rejection at the inflection point of $12,300.

42401136,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLmyj,1519203613,Russia Is Leading the Push for Blockchain Democracy,"Even as Russia stands accused of meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, its national capital is taking a leadership role in making democracy more transparent.  Using an existing program called Active Citizen, the city of Moscow has been allowing residents to cast votes for measures ranging from the name of their new metro train to the color of the seats in a new sports arena. But in an effort to soothe people's concerns over whether to trust the city in its vote counting, it's added a private version of the ethereum blockchain to that project's architecture.  ""Of course, sometimes we hear that not all the votes are trusted,"" said Andrey Belozerov, the strategy and innovations advisor to the city's CIO. ""So, we decided to use a blockchain for the Active Citizen project, as a platform of electronic trust.""  The ethereum-based platform, which allows anyone to audit the open-source results, has been downloaded by more than 100 node operators since its December launch.  In this way, the city hopes to gain the trust of the citizens of Moscow, but bigger than that, win the trust of state governments around the world.  While a so-called ""blockchain cold war"" in which nations use the technology to undermine one another's financial influence is worrying to some, Belozerov hopes blockchain tests like Active Citizen could result in an increased sense of trust between nations.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Belozerov said:  ""The idea is to put all the votes to the blockchain to make it open so everybody can connect to our blockchain network, and to check the voting process, and so-on and so-forth.""  Adoption and scale  Originally launched in 2014 as a way for Moscow's elected officials to give its citizens a say in the make-up of their city, the Active Citizen program has registered 2 million users.  In total, 3,450 polls have been conducted using the centralized Oracle database that the platform was built on initially, and as of last week, 92 million votes had been cast, with only the most recent fraction of those also logged on the new blockchain platform.  One such vote logged on the ethereum platform was a measure that allowed citizens to vote whether they'd opt-in to be temporarily relocated while the building they live in now was demolished and replaced by a newer, nicer building.  And while Belozerov said there is ""huge interest from the market,"" he acknowledges that there are still hurdles to work out.  For one, aligning with concerns in the public blockchain space, Belozerov wonders how well the blockchain platform will scale.  So far, the platform has only ever reached a peak transaction volume of about 1,000 transactions per minute. But if the Active Citizen project attracted more of the Moscow's 12 million citizens, it remains unclear whether the blockchain be able to handle the volume.  According to Belozerov, increased adoption of the platform will make the perfect stress-test.  ""In the end of the first quarter, we will determine if it works properly with our loads,"" he said. ""Then we can switch off the previous model of Active Citizen and go natively to a blockchain.""  Winning trust  Still, with the broader goal in mind, interest from Moscow citizens doesn't necessarily equate to interest from governments beyond the city limits.  In an effort to prove that the system is trustworthy, the City of Moscow commissioned ""Big Four"" accounting firm PwC to conduct an independent audit of the code.  ""The company studied the possibility of manipulating the outcome of polls by both internal employees and external attacks,"" said Belozerov, and found that there are not reasons for concern in polls that have more than 300,000 votes.  According to the Mayor of Moscow's official website, the most popular polls are getting between 137,000 and 220,000 participants currently.  In addition, PwC also simulated external cyberattacks and was unable to replace the votes of an electronic referendum or gain unauthorized access to the results, Belozerov said. PwC was not able to confirm the results, citing a policy not to comment on work with customers.  And not only that, but Belozerov believes there's momentum from government entities to adopt blockchain technology for not only enhanced transparency, but also other efficiencies.  Case in point, he pointed to a recent test by Russia's Ministry of Economic Development and the Federal Service for State Registration to see how blockchain could give owners a faster and cheaper way to prove they own their belongings. And beyond that, he mentioned Dubai's work to move all its government records to a blockchain by 2025.  Yet, Belozerov acknowledges that even more so than the scaling challenges, is what he believes is an ingrained resistance from government leaders that could prove the largest obstacle to adoption.  ""Of course, the hardest question is to change their opinion, or to change their minds with this approach,"" he said, but remaining optimistic, concluded:  ""I see a very strong trend for moving of different countries and different companies to this technology.""

42401131,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLmto,1519196430,Gibraltar Will Take Market-Driven Approach to ICO Rules,"Gibraltar may be moving to regulate initial coin offerings (ICOs), but officials say it will be up to the market to determine what a ""good"" token sale looks like.  The U.K. overseas territory announced that it was drafting ICO regulation earlier this month, which will include the implementation of a system for ""authorized sponsors"" that will be tasked with managing compliance. Gibraltar's government outlined a tripartite approach that would address ""the promotion, sale and distribution of tokens,"" create a well-regulated secondary market related to tokens and establish standards for the provision of advice relating to token investment within its jurisdiction.  ""We don't see a place for us as a regulator, or indeed Gibraltar as a jurisdiction that makes its own laws, for saying what 'good' looks like in token sales,"" Sian Jones, a senior advisor to the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC), told CoinDesk in an interview Tuesday.  Instead, regulators would ""rather let the marketplace of authorized sponsors come up with possibly a number of different options of what good looks like,"" Jones said.  Jones explained that a one-size-fits-all regulatory approach would be inappropriate for the blockchain funding model, and that Gibraltar is instead developing a set of principles for best practice. With these principles, each authorized sponsor will be able to ""come up with its own methodology"" to apply to the ICOs or tokens that they sponsor.  Asked if these measures implied a kind of self-regulation on the part of sponsors, Jones replied:  ""I don't know that I would reach as far as saying it's self-regulatory, but it certainly resonates – the idea that the marketplace will determine what a good ICO looks like.""  Paul Astengo, senior finance executive at the Gibraltar Finance Centre, told CoinDesk that the timing of the territory's ICO regulation is a product of its efforts to ""keep abreast of developments"" in the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry.  He explained that the legislation is the logical next step after Gibraltar's Jan. introduction of a license for companies working with distributed ledger technology, which has made it an appealing destination for blockchain startups.  Likewise, Astengo said, ""We want to welcome good quality companies, we want to welcome people that wish to operate that are as concerned for their reputation as we are for ours. And we want to make sure that all of the different elements for this regulatory framework will be enough to support what they're trying to achieve for their firms.""  Roadmap for crypto fund rules  Astengo and Jones also confirmed reports that Gibraltar is considering regulation related to investment funds associated with cryptocurrencies and tokens.  ""We are reviewing the inclusion of crypto-related assets in funds in our investment funds,"" Jones said.""I think it's fair to say that our thinking is not yet as developed as it is around token sales. So it's a matter that's under review right now."" Officials expect to iron out additional details on the matter later this year.  Both officials view Gibraltar's forthcoming ICO legislation as one element in a regulatory framework that will continue to evolve parallel to the progression of the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry.  ""We see blockchain and distributed ledger technology as a long game,"" Jones said. ""We see this as something that will have an important and profound effect on trust relationships with both customers and enterprises, citizens and government, and therefore something which is highly sustainable.""

Announced late Tuesday night, Maduro offered no evidence to back up the claim, though the messaging notably came directly from his official Twitter account.    A grandes problemas, ¡grandes soluciones! Desde el primer minuto el juego arrancó bien, y arrancamos ganando: 4.777 millones de yuanes o 735 millones de dólares es el resultado inicial de las operaciones de intención de compra del Petro. #AlFuturoConElPetro pic.twitter.com/LoaDgj4rr1        — Nicolás Maduro (@NicolasMaduro) February 21, 2018      Reuters  and the Associated Press said that no information about who invested in the pre-sale was offered by Maduro, who unveiled the results during a national broadcast on Tuesday.  That said, Maduro struck bullish notes about the initiative, which he unveiled in December with the intent of using it to circumvent sanctions imposed by the U.S. government.  ""Today, a cryptocurrency is being born that can take on Superman,"" Maduro was quoted as saying by Reuters, referring to the U.S. by way of the comic book character. AP further cited him: ""We have taken a giant step into the 21st century.""  The presale was launched Tuesday and is planned to last into next month.  As CoinDesk reported previously, the Venezuelan government claims that the petro token will be backed by a single barrel of oil and tied to the market price from the previous day.  Yet questions remain about which network the token will operate within, given that one document released today highlights the ethereum network, while another, constituting a buyer's guide, cites an alternative blockchain system called NEM.  Conflicting details aside, Venezuela's plan represents the first time that a country has moved to issue its own cryptocurrency. The story has grabbed global headlines and sparked rejections from politicians both inside and outside of the South American country.  Critics, including those from Venezuela's opposition-controlled Congress, have attacked the plan as an illegal act and a vehicle for corruption. Senators from the U.S. have also raised concerns about the expressed plan to avoid sanctions through the cryptocurrency's use, though how that will play out in practice remains to be seen.

42401140,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLn0h,1519182036,Tesla's Cloud Hit By Crypto Mining Malware Attack,"Electric vehicle maker Tesla has reportedly fallen victim to a cryptocurrency mining malware attack.  On Tuesday, cybersecurity software firm RedLock reportedhttps://blog.redlock.io/cryptojacking-tesla that hackers had exploited an insecure Kubernetes console, which they used to access and siphon computer processing power from Tesla's cloud environment in order to mine cryptocurrencies. The team says it discovered and reported the vulnerability to Tesla several months ago.  A Tesla spokesperson told Gizmodo that customer information was not accessed during the incident.  ""We maintain a bug bounty program to encourage this type of research, and we addressed this vulnerability within hours of learning about it,"" the spokesperson reportedly said, explaining:  ""The impact seems to be limited to internally-used engineering test cars only, and our initial investigation found no indication that customer privacy or vehicle safety or security was compromised in any way.""  Unlike previous crypto mining attacks, the hackers that targeted Tesla did not utilize a public mining pool. Instead, they installed mining pool software and obscured it behind CloudFlare, which allowed them to hide the IP address of their mining pool server, making detection of the mining more difficult. To further hide their actions, the hackers ensured that CPU usage remained low during the hack.  RedLock CTO Gaurav Kumar said that public cloud environments are particularly vulnerable to mining hacks, which have been on the rise in tandem with the increase in cryptocurrencies' value.  ""Organizations' public cloud environments are ideal targets due to the lack of effective cloud threat defense programs,"" he explained to Gizmodo. ""In the past few months alone, we have uncovered a number of cryptojacking incidents including the one affecting Tesla.""
