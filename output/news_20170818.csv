42400314,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJDoV,1503093837,$700 and Rising: What's Driving the Price of Bitcoin Cash?,"Bitcoin cash surged above $700 today, passing a notable milestone amidst a two-day rally during which the price of the cryptocurrency more than doubled.  Heading into weekend trading sessions, bitcoin cash has emerged as the third-largest cryptocurrency by network value, behind bitcoin and ethereum. And while it might still be too early to compare bitcoin cash to these more established networks (there remain unanswered questions about its particular economics), traders are proving it might have staying power.  Overall, the development is the latest in a narrative that began when bitcoin cash split off from the main bitcoin blockchain earlier this month because a group of miners and developers moved to adopt software with new network rules that were incompatible with bitcoin.  The result: bitcoin ""forked"" into two distinct blockchains, each with their own freely-traded digital assets. But while bitcoin surged past $4,000 to set new all-time highs, bitcoin cash stayed largely stagnant this week – trading in the $300 range. Yet, at press time, bitcoin cash was trading around $750 per coin.  So what's driving these jumps? And will these drivers continue to propel price movements, both up and down, in the future?  Driver 1: New exchange volume  While both bitcoin and bitcoin cash share a transaction history, there's at least one major differential that changes their markets – bitcoin cash didn't inherent bitcoin's expansive global exchange network.  This means while bitcoin is widely available for trading across continents, only a few major players stepped up early to add Bitcoin Cash.  Still, signs suggest more exchanges could soon see a value in doing so. Case in point, the trade volume in bitcoin cash observed during the recent run was largely denominated in the South Korean won today.  Earlier this afternoon, about $1.2 billion of the $2 billion in total bitcoin cash trade volume, or around 56%, appeared to be transacted in won on just three South Korean exchanges – Bithumb, Coinone and Korbit – according to data from CoinMarketCap.  Such a strong regional showing could indicate pent up demand – but whether it's from sellers seeking to sell, or buyers looking to buy, that remains unclear.  Prior to the increase, though, bitcoin cash trading volume was relatively light earlier this week, and it increased roughly tenfold earlier this afternoon.  Driver 2: Miner mechanics  The value of cryptocurrencies is driven by technology and economics, and bitcoin cash is no exception.  So, just like with its nascent exchange network, it remained unclear how much infrastructure support bitcoin cash would inherit following the split. Remember, for a blockchain to be successful, it must attract miners willing to devote computing power to securing the ledger on which its users transact.  In this way, on August 1, bitcoin cash was at a disadvantage. But that may be changing, too.  At the time of the split, bitcoin cash had far fewer miners, and because of the messy mechanics of the split, it remained difficult to mine. With the price hovering around $300, many miners weren't earning as much as they could have on the other chain.  But, the network difficulty has been slowly decreasing since (the difficulty adjusts to the number of miners mining on the chain), and it's now set to decline further. This weekend, the mining difficulty of the bitcoin cash network is expected to decrease by an estimated 50%.  Many believe this will make the cryptocurrency easier to mine, and with the recent price upticks, profitable to mine.  What happens from there is anyone's guess – the exact incentives are still murky. If today is any indication, though, the narrative may just be getting interesting.

42400276,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJDfe,1503081904,SEC Statements Spur ShapeShift to Review Cryptocurrency Listings,"Cryptocurrency exchange service is reviewing its listings in light of recent statements on initial coin offerings (ICOs) from the US Securities and Exchange Commission.  In a new blog post, the exchange said that it was launching the review, which could see it delist some of the trading pairs it offers, in a bid to avoid being ""mischaracterized as a securities exchange.""  As CoinDesk previously reported, the SEC revealed last month that it had been investigating The DAO, the ethereum-based funding vehicle that raised more than $150 million through a token sale. The agency ultimately ruled that those tokens – which were sold and later freely traded on cryptocurrency exchanges – qualify as securities, and that other token sales may fall under this definition as well.  It's in light of this statement that ShapeShift has asked its lawyers to examine whether the Howey Test – a long-standing test used to determine whether certain assets qualify as securities – applies to the tokens it lists. It's a notable development which signals that the SEC statement is having at least some impact on the startups that facilitate the exchange of blockchain-based tokens.  ShapeShift explained in the blog post:  ""This means that we may need to delist some types of tokens from the platform, which is unfortunate for our users who have enjoyed the ability to participate in these experimental and innovative technologies. We have thus instructed our counsel to examine the tokens available on ShapeShift, especially through the lens of the Howey Test, which is the test the SEC applies to determine the presence of a security.""  As the statement goes on to suggest, US-based customers of ShapeShift may be the ones that feel the biggest impact as the review moves ahead.  ""As that analysis is done, certain tokens may be removed from the service for individuals within the United States, who will then no longer be able to interact with these technologies safely or transparently through the ShapeShift platform,"" the startup said, going on to add that it may ""consider the application of the Howey test to all new tokens we list.""

42400288,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJDnW,1503073797,Corporate Analyst Fisco Tests Issuance of Bitcoin Bond in Japan,"A financial data provider and bitcoin exchange operator in Japan is testing a digital bond denominated in the cryptocurrency.  As reported earlier this week by Bloomberg, Fisco – which launched a bitcoin exchange in September of last year and has invested in other exchanges like TechBureau – issued a test bond worth 200 bitcoins. A bond is a kind of debt issued over a certain period of time, usually paying out some form of interest in addition to the principal amount.  The three-year bond was exchanged from one company within the Fisco umbrella to another, according to the publication, and is said to provide a 3 percent return over the three-year period.  That companies in Japan would move in this direction is perhaps unsurprising, given that it only a few months ago, Japan's government passed and signed into law new statutes that recognize bitcoin as a legal payment instrument. At the same time, the new laws brought domestic bitcoin exchanges under the auspices of Japanese financial regulators.  Other firms have looked to the tech as a vehicle for issuing bonds, including European automaker Daimler, which issued a €100 million corporate bond through a private version of the ethereum network.  In comments to Bloomberg, Masayuki Tashiro, Fisco's chief product officer, suggested that the trial could lead to a new way to generate revenue – provided it receives a blessing from the government.  Tashiro suggested that the exchange may move to test other kinds of cryptocurrency-based debt in the future.

42400291,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJDqT,1503070207,Australia Weighs Jail Time for Cryptocurrency Exchange Offenders,"New details have emerged about Australia's proposed cryptocurrency exchange law.  As reported yesterday by CoinDesk, Australia is moving ahead with plans to formalize the government's oversight of the domestic exchange space. Specifically, the government wants to update existing anti-money laundering statutes to account for the tech.  A draft text of the bill  has since been posted to the website of the Australian Parliament, offering key details on how the country plans to regulate the industry.  Of particular note are the penalties for operating an unlicensed cryptocurrency exchange – offenders could face as many as seven years in prison, depending on the severity of the violation and whether they've received prior warnings from regulators.  First-time offenders could be hit with prison sentences as long as two years and as much as $100,000 in fines. Repeat offenders may also receive fines as high as $400,000.  ""A person...must not provide a registrable digital currency exchange service to another person if the first person is not a registered digital currency exchange provider,"" the bill states.  The measure also outlines the creation of a so-called ""Digital Currency Exchange Register"", which would be overseen by the Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), the Australia's foremost financial intelligence agency.  The registration process could take as many as 180 days, according to the bill's text, depending on the outcome of AUSTRAC's approval process and if subsequent filings are required by the applicant.  In statements yesterday, the Australian government positioned the measure as one that would close a ""gap"" in the regulatory structure for cryptocurrency businesses.  ""The bill will ... close a regulatory gap by bringing digital currency exchange providers under the remit of AUSTRAC,"" officials said.

42400280,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJDhc,1503064993,Overseas Expansion: Japan's BitFlyer to Sell Bitcoin in US Market,"Japanese bitcoin exchange bitFlyer is heading to the U.S.  The exchange has opened an office in San Francisco, and representatives of the company said bitFlyer has obtained approval to operate in 34 states when it launches. It's not clear when exactly the exchange launch will take place, but bitFlyer said it's committing to sometime in the Fall of 2017.  CEO Yuzo Kano said in a statement:  ""While bitFlyer, Inc. is headquartered in Japan, my vision was always to create a global company, and I am excited that the U.S. will be its first step toward global expansion. Bitcoin is a global currency, now our exchange will be global too.""  It's a notable development given the complicated nature of the U.S. regulatory landscape – in which regulators in each state have their own licenses and oversight regimes – and the relative lack of new, major bitcoin exchanges opening their doors to American customers. What's more, the push by some states, like Washington to increase oversight of cryptocurrency trading activities has led some exchanges to pull out of those markets entirely.  BitFlyer said it plans to initially launch markets for bitcoin trading, although it suggested more cryptocurrency integrations will be coming in the future. The goal, the exchange indicated, is to ""expand to support other trading pairs and products"" over the course of next year.  The startup raised roughly $27 million in a Series C funding round last year, and to date it has garnered more than $34 million in venture capital.

42400254,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJBTs,1503064883,Bitcoin Cash Is Now More Profitable to Mine Than Bitcoin,"Bitcoin cash's surge above $500 today is changing more than just the the net worth of its investors and users.  The rising price is also creating the incentive for miners to dedicate computing power to the bitcoin cash blockchain, one that could find them moving away from bitcoin. With the new push, bitcoin cash miners are making around 2% more mining on bitcoin than they do on bitcoin cash.  And that spread could further increase with an upcoming adjustment on bitcoin cash that will make it even easier to mine.  Block 479,808 (set for this weekend) will likely trigger a difficulty adjustment downwards 50%, and if the prices of bitcoin and bitcoin cash stay the same, this means miners will make almost double on bitcoin cash what they would on bitcoin.  However, even with this threshold met, not all things are equal on both chains.  The bitcoin blockchain charges higher fees on transactions, so miners must take into account the extra 1.5 BTC per block on bitcoin (about $6,000 USD). By comparison, bitcoin cash has very low fees (typically under $50 USD).  Lastly, depending on the block times, bitcoin currently gets the 100 confirmations needed to spend the mining reward faster than bitcoin cash. (Currently, bitcoin takes about 17 hours and bitcoin cash takes about 34 hours).  Further, combined with the higher liquidity, bitcoin may still emerge as more attractive to mine at the moment.

42400251,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJBRu,1503061201,$26 Million: Blockchain VR Project Decentraland Raises New Funding in ICO,"A virtual reality project built on top of blockchain technology has raised over $26 million in ether via an initial coin offering (ICO).  Decentraland, as previously reported by CoinDesk, is looking to create a virtual world, in which blockchain acts as a registry for digital plots of land. Among those involved is developer Manuel Aráoz, who also built the bitcoin document timestamping tool Proof of Existence.  Kicking off yesterday afternoon, the ICO raised 86,206 ether ($26,203,082 at press time), according to the Decentraland website, and hit its pre-set hard cap in a little over an hour.  The speed with which the raise was completed evoked memories of the Brave sale in May, which concluded in an astonishing 30 seconds. Perceptions that, as a result, the tokens sold will have ended up in the hands of a few bigger investors stoked some criticism on social media.  Decentraland's ICO is the latest in a string of such crowdsales, as illustrated by data from CoinDesk's ICO Tracker, that have raised more than a billion dollars-worth of cryptocurrency to date. More than $500 million was raised in July alone through the funding model.  Also completed this week, was an ICO held by 0x, a decentralized exchange project, which raised $24 million.

Modeled after the storied XPRIZE award, Wenger's offer requires that the blog be built using emerging blockchain technologies in which Union Square Ventures is an investor, in particular, the Blockstack developer kit and decentralized storage system IPFS, built by Protocol Labs.  Wenger had previously written of his idea for a blog without a central authority on his Tumblr channel. In the post, he raised concerns over monetary strategies as the blogging space becomes increasingly centralized.  In particular, he expressed concern that since his portfolio company Tumblr had been acquired by Yahoo, which was in turn acquired by Verizon earlier this year, he might lose control over important features and be forced to accept ads he hadn't agreed to.  This is the second time this week that a well-known investor has revealed his intentions to launch a blockchain prize for developers. On Wednesday, AngelList founder Naval Ravikant confirmed he would fund a competition to build a decentralized Twitter, also using the Blockstack developer kit.  And signs suggest this may be the start of a larger trend to boost development on the Blockstack platform, as sources have told CoinDesk that more prizes may be in the works.  Earlier this week, Blockstack revealed the formation of a $25 million fund backed by five venture capital firms. It will invest solely in startups using the platform, designed to power a new decentralized internet.  Still, comments by those close to the activities suggest plans may be in early stages.  Blockstack co-founder Muneeb Ali told CoinDesk:  ""High-profile investors are willing to put up these prizes for specific apps. We're pretty excited about that, but we're ironing out the details.""

42400264,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJBbk,1503054902,D+H Files for Multiple Patents on Private Blockchain Tech,"Canada-based fintech vendor D+H Corporation has filed three patent applications relating to the creation and use of private distributed ledgers.  The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office published the trio of applications yesterday, public records show, all of which share the same title: ""Peer-to-Peer Financial Transactions Using A Private Distributed Ledger."" The applications were submitted on February 10.  The applications themselves focus on the ways in which a private distributed ledger can be built and managed. Unlike public blockchains like bitcoin, in which any user can launch a node or compete to add their own transaction blocks, private networks restrict users to a list of permissioned parties.  As explained in the abstract of one of the applications:  ""Methods and systems for performing peer-to-peer financial transactions using a private distributed ledger are described. One example method includes allocating an initial currency value to a genesis address, the initial currency value representing a maximum value of currency to be managed in the blockchain network; identifying a new member to add to the blockchain network; generating an address for the new member; and transferring an amount from the genesis address the address for the new member, the transferred amount equaling an amount to be managed by the new member in the blockchain network.""  The blockchain-related filings are the first for the Canada-based D+H, which, as reported last year by CoinDesk, has moved to integrate blockchain into its suite of payment services.  The firm has also worked with financial institutions like Rabobank on developing blockchain applications.

42400270,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJBgf,1503050404,Couldn't Claim Your Bitcoin Cash? BTC.Com Now Has a Tool for That,"Users who weren't able to claim their bitcoin cash in the wake of this month's hard fork now have a better chance of retrieving their lost funds.  Announced this week, BTC.com has launched a recovery tool for the cryptocurrency, one designed to let users whose wallets didn't support the switch to claim their coins.  Because users of some services still technically own bitcoin cash (but don't have access to it), the tool allows them to ""extract"" bitcoin cash from their wallets by exporting the keys and, then, move the currency into a new, supporting wallet.  If it sounds complex, it is. To put it simply, when bitcoin cash split from the bitcoin blockchain, anyone who owned bitcoin as the two networks parted ways were suddenly allocated an equal amount of bitcoin cash. However, many users were unable to access their new funds because the contentious and fast-moving fork caught many digital wallet providers off guard.  While some wallets supported the currency from the get-go, others decided against it because of concerns about confusing customers and a lack of technical resources to integrate the new cryptocurrecy.  In a blog post, BTC.com's online marketing manager, Nikol Daru, explained why the tool was needed, saying:  ""Recovering bitcoin cash from a bitcoin wallet in a do-it-yourself manner can be a risky process that requires serious expertise. That's why we have developed this designated recovery tool, to make the process easy and seamless for everyone.""  There's one big caveat, however: the service only works for specific wallets. According to the blog post, Blockchain and Mycelium are compatible with the tool, as well as unnamed others.  The launch could come as a relief to some in the community, including some who support bitcoin cash's technical roadmap and others who desire gains from holding or selling off the new asset.  And those funds are looking increasingly worth retrieving.

42400265,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJBcj,1503046856,Database Giant Oracle Wants Better Governance for Blockchains,"Multinational software provider Oracle is working on a way to introduce ""fair"" governance to permissioned blockchains, according to a newly published patent application.  The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) released the application for ""Accountability and Trust in Distributed Ledger Systems"" on August 17, after it was initially submitted in late May 2016. Specifically, it focuses on so-called permissioned blockchains – those in which participants are limited to approved parties.  For the basis of the patent, the firm draws issue with some approaches to maintaining permissioned blockchains, particularly when it comes to the subject of policing the activities of nodes.  As the application details:  ""Even in permissioned ledgers, however, a participating node may violate a fairness policy, for example because it has been hacked, its software is defective, or its operator is dishonest. In principle, permissioned ledgers make it easier to hold nodes accountable for fairness policy violations: once exposed, a violator may lose a deposit, may be expelled from the ledger, or may be sued. In practice, however, reducing the opportunities for internal fairness violations, and detecting them when they occur, is a non-trivial problem.""  Such problematic behaviors also include transaction censorship, as well as ""dropping or reordering transactions"" within nodes. Oracle's application proposes a method to resolve these concerns, constituting a system that utilizes a modified version of the open-source code developed by blockchain startup Tendermint.  ""Accountability and Trust"" is the second patent application submitted by Oracle to date.

42400263,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJBYn,1503043224,What's Next for Bitcoin Cash? Making Profitless Mining Profitable,"You might not expect bitcoin miners to leave money on the table – but according to estimates, some are, and lots of it.  Rather than simply mining the version of the bitcoin blockchain that's purely the most profitable (today it's the original BTC blockchain), a portion of the network is instead choosing to earn less by directing computer power toward bitcoin cash (BCH or BCC), a version of the blockchain created in a fork earlier this month.  But, far from just another data point in the ongoing flame war between the two camps, it's a development with some interesting implications.  That's because the results, while early, appear to provide a counterpoint to the thinking that has so far driven decisions in the field of ""crypto economics,"" wherein protocols are built to combine economic incentives and game theory.  Should more money be available on one version of the blockchain, it would stand to reason, some miners would simply switch.  But the continued existence of bitcoin cash shows that short-term profit isn't the only consideration.  While some argue that blockchains that failed to garner majority hashing power will die off – and bitcoin cash still could – it is now providing the latest example that this theory doesn't necessarily work in practice.  And, as bitcoin heads for potentially more forks ahead, this suggests more versions of the blockchain could persist, possibly splitting miners and diluting the network.  Political value  So, who's mining bitcoin cash? And why are they OK with losing money?  To begin, there are currently only a few mining operations, the largest an unknown actor (or pool of actors) controlling roughly 90 percent of the hash power on bitcoin cash.  Some speculate the motivation driving these miners is a purely ideological devotion to bigger blocks, the reason bitcoin cash supporters split from bitcoin in the first place. (Bitcoin cash boasts 8MB blocks, as opposed to 1MB blocks on bitcoin).  Others believe it's more personal, and there's reason to suggest it could be both.  ViaBTC, the first mining pool to enable its miners to support bitcoin cash, has called for the developers of bitcoin's most popular software implementation, Bitcoin Core, to be fired. Further, Jihan Wu, co-CEO of Bitmain, one of the world's largest miners, spends much of his day sending memes mocking the team on a popular bitcoin cash WeChat thread.  The anecdotal evidence would suggest then that ""political"" or ""ideological"" motivations are also coming to play a role in mining. After all, there is always a certain intangible value to validating your own arguments.  Others, though, believe there's more at play than simply a digital ""I told you so,"" and that miners are banking on bitcoin cash's future profitability.  The mining loop  Another question is how to gauge ""profitability,"" as there are many factors that contribute to how profitable it is to mine any cryptocurrency. This includes its price, how hard it is to mine (""difficulty"") and how often block rewards are released.  Against these metrics, it's safe to say bitcoin cash is having challenges, so far.  Today, it's taking longer for bitcoin cash miners to mine blocks, and coupled with the fact that its price is roughly 6% of bitcoin's, most miners don't seem particularly interested (yet) in moving over to the new network.  This creates a kind of chicken-and-egg scenario, one the creators and users of bitcoin cash appear to be aware of as evidenced by their complex efforts to make it easier mine. But, it is taking a long time for these changes to be enacted.  Still, supporters are hopeful that bitcoin cash can reach an equilibrium at which more miners might have an economic motivation to make a switch.  As bitcoin cash difficulty slowly adjusts downward toward a targeted 10-minute block time, the cryptocurrency is growing easier to mine. Several blocks are now being mined an hour.  Eventual profit  Still, even if bitcoin cash finally reaches the point where it's as profitable or more profitable than bitcoin, it's unclear what will happen.  Scott Morgan, co-founder of bitcoin wallet Airbitz and Chief Crypto Officer of Nanome, which develops the decentralized research platform Matryx.ai, expects some miners, serving their profit motives, to move over to bitcoin cash.  Morgan told CoinDesk:  ""There are some miners that are going to be smart. They'll wait to see what the blocks look like, and then divert some attention to it.""  The profit could be even greater seeing that miners of bitcoin cash can use older, less-expensive mining rigs. And at this point, mining pools, which provide the software for many smaller miners, could be tempted to enable the option.  China-based BTC.TOP, for example, plans to let miners in its pool mine the cryptocurrency once it becomes profitable. It's possible that even mining pools that are ideologically opposed to bitcoin cash and its scaling goals might do so for the profit.  But we might not have to wait and see for long.  According to a Reddit post, bitcoin cash could have its first ""non-emergency"" difficulty adjustment this weekend. At its current price, and with the difficulty adjusting downward by about 60%, some believe bitcoin cash could then eclipse bitcoin, becoming more profitable to mine than the latter.  Temporary upticks  Still, even if mining pools move over, bitcoin developer Alphonse Pace argued this could only be a temporary move. Switching from cryptocurrency to cryptocurrency to chase profit is a common practice, he argued.  ""Mining will eventually reach a parity where mining one chain is equally profitable on any chain,"" Pace said. ""If it becomes more profitable, it will be temporary until difficulty swings back, and it's no longer.""  The arguments for temporary spikes in bitcoin cash mining only get more complicated from there.  Bitcoin Unlimited chief scientist Peter Rizun highlighted another potential scenario: Mining bitcoin cash blocks could be more profitable to mine than bitcoin during short periods that have to do with its difficulty algorithm, contingent on its price increasing.  ""Because the difficulty adjusts only very slowly, bitcoin cash becomes twice as profitable to mine as bitcoin. Hash-per-hash, miners would earn double by mining bitcoin cash,"" he said.  Basically what Rizun's saying is that if the price of bitcoin cash rose, the long difficulty adjustment window would give miners a longer time period to make money. But Rizun said that could also be temporary.  Based on the bitcoin cash's unique mining algorithm, miners might earn more for a couple weeks, before the difficulty would adjust back up again.  Miners follow users  But whether bitcoin cash and its mining mechanism will be profitable isn't solely based on this ""break-even"" point where miners are incentivized by profit.  ""It's a gamble,"" Airbitz's Morgan said, arguing the price of bitcoin cash could just as likely go down, since many users still intend to sell off the coins they received simply by being bitcoin owners during the fork.  Some bitcoin cash owners might not yet know how to sell their holdings, Morgan continued, or haven't been able to because the slow block times have led to transaction backlogs.  He concluded:  ""A lot of volume hasn't been touched yet.”  Sources also stressed that bitcoin's rise has been more about user adoption, and that it will likely be the same for bitcoin cash.  The argument is that bitcoin's long-term viability, and mining profitability, has depended on (and will continue to depend on) consumers and businesses actually using the cryptocurrency, and that the blockchain with the most users is the most valuable.  It's an increasingly common philosophy in the bitcoin space due to how recent game theoretic events related to scaling have played out, one that also advances understanding of the nascent science driving it all.  Bitcoin developer Daniel Krawisz argued:  ""I think investors matter a lot more than miners. [Bitcoin cash] should worry about them.""
