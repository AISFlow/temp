42398153,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbShNK,1422123740,Fred Wilson: Blockchain Applications Still Biggest Opportunity in Bitcoin,"Amidst a bearish price cycle and a wave of negative press, it’s safe to say that 2015 may be yet another year filled with growing pains for bitcoin. In the face of these obstacles, however, many of its veteran supporters are standing strong and banding together.  Given its longstanding support for the digital currency ecosystem, it’s perhaps no surprise that Union Square Ventures (USV) participated in Coinbase’s recent $75m funding round alongside Andreessen Horowitz and Draper Fisher Jurvetson.  USV has so far participated in three of Coinbase’s four public funding rounds, while appearing at marquee events in the industry’s history.  Notably, principal Fred Wilson has also been outspoken about bitcoin’s regulatory environment and its long-term potential as a technology, often in the face of criticism for his views. Today, USV remains as bullish on the technology as ever.  Speaking to CoinDesk about its participation in this week’s funding, Fred Wilson echoed many of his previous positions regarding bitcoin as an investor, while shedding new insights as to what he believes are the most compelling parts of the ecosystem today.  Perhaps most intriguingly, Wilson emphasized that USV is no longer as interested in the financial applications of the blockchain, stating:  ”We’re not interested in investing in a company that’s the same as Coinbase. I think Coinbase has a big opportunity in front of itself and so we’re careful not to investment anywhere close to what they’re doing.”  Wilson went on to explain that he views Coinbase as a foundational layer for a new suite of applications to be built on top of the bitcoin protocol and with alternative blockchains.  For example, Wilson cited USV’s investment in decentralised identity protocol provider OneName, which is built on namecoin, as an example of the kinds of projects he most looks forward to seeing developed in the coming years.  Further, Wilson sought to frame the immediate future as crucial to shaping how the bitcoin ecosystem will develop in the long term.  “It is still very early days for all those projects,” he continued. “We’ll see whether users value the types of things that can be built on top of the blockchain.”  Looking beyond finance  Wilson went on to describe the kinds of projects that he is most excited about seeing developed in the coming years.  For example, he cited decentralized Dropbox-like storage solutions and next-generation databases, as well as new types of marketplaces and ticketing solutions, as potential innovations that could be built on bitcoin’s underlying blockchain ledger.  “There are a whole bunch of things that don’t have anything to do with bitcoin itself, or sending, receiving and storing bitcoin,” Wilson continued.  Still, he stressed that these types of projects are still conceptual, and that a new generation of bitcoin innovators will have to prove that such solutions can reach everyday users.  The examples mentioned may be noteworthy given that Wilson spoke openly about blockchain-based identity solutions at TechCrunch Disrupt last year, comments that might have hinted at his firm’s later involvement with OneName.  Positive signals  As for whether other participants in the round shared his views, Wilson was less sure, noting that he has only had conversations with Fortune 500 financial services giant USAA, who he described as quite knowledgeable about the technology.  However, he voiced his belief that the participating firms all likely understand bitcoin far better than the community might expect, and that they may be aware of crypto 2.0-type applications.  He said:  ""We have this impression that these are big dumb companies, but they’re not. They read the research and they read the blog posts and they get it.""  Wilson argued that the participation of big-brand investors, however, is likely to send positive signals to the wider financial world while benefitting the team at Coinbase.  “Whatever the reaction was, BBVA is a very innovative bank, USAA is also very innovative, and they have a tradition of embracing new things,” he added. “They’re good partners.”  Benefits for bitcoin  Throughout the conversation, Wilson also expressed his desire that Coinbase will use the funding in ways that could help expand the entire bitcoin ecosystem, becoming more global, mobile, open and secure, all goals echoed by CEO Brian Armstrong.  In particular, Wilson indicated that he wants Coinbase to focus on its APIs and software development kits (SDKs) so that developers can build on its growing platform.  “Let’s just say that Coinbase has 10 million wallets all over the world, then developers could build applications for ticketing or lending,” he said. “[Becoming more] open is another very important piece of it.”  Wilson also sought to frame Coinbase’s success as integral to the world, speaking positively about the future he believes the company can help unlock.  He concluded:  “It would be a very different world than the one we live in today.""

42398161,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbShVC,1422120715,Review: Haasbot 2.0 Brings Automated Trading to the Next Level,"Name: Haasbot 2.0  What is it: Haasbot is a sophisticated bitcoin trading bot suite designed primarily for bitcoin trading professionals, but amateur traders and hobbyists could find it useful too.  Who’s behind it: Haasbot started life as a personal project created by Stephan de Haas, but eventually the small team behind the bot decided to commercialise their product. The core team includes de Haas, lead developer and founder of Haasonline; marketing manager Phil Donsbach; developer Lander Vanhaverbeke; and support specialist Theo Goodman.  Cost: Haasbot 2.0 is available in three different pricing tiers. Haasonline uses a subscription-based model. A three-month 'Beginner' licence costs 0.22 BTC, the 'Simple' licence is priced at 0.30 BTC, while the full 'Advanced' licence costs 0.45 BTC. The company also offers 6- and 12-month licences. Payments in fiat currency are not accepted.  Product Launched: January 2015.  Summary: Haasbot 2.0 provides users with a wide range of choice, with three basic bots, all of which feature a number of different presets, as well as a range of user-customisable options. Depending on the licence, users can set up several interconnected bots capable of performing a range of different functions.  CoinDesk rating: 4.5/5  The Basics  While Haasbot is a relatively familiar name in some circles, bitcoin users may not have heard of it. It is a niche software solution for bitcoin traders rather than mainstream users, a professional tool for people that know what they are doing.  In its latest incarnation, Haasbot 2.0 offers a number of new features, but the big news is the entirely reworked user interface (UI) that should improve user experience over 1.x versions.  The basic functionality remains unchanged and Haasbot 2.0 still offers three types of standard bot: Trade, Arbitrage and Maximum Order. Trade bots are supported by a range of technical analysis indicators, safeties and insurances. The 2.0 update also brings customisable Script bots and other new features.  The Advanced licence enables users to create an unlimited number of bots and use all available safeties, insurances and indicators. The Simple licence is limited to three bots from each category for a total of nine bots, while the Beginner licence supports two bots from each category, allowing the user to create a total of six bots. Beginner and Simple licences also offer a limited choice of safeties, indicators and insurances on trade bots.  The team also claims transparency and prides itself on providing support via forums and a wiki page, as well as integrating some features requested by users.  Haasbot 2.0 currently supports Bitfinex, Bitstamp, BTC-e, CEX-IO, Cryptsy, Huobi, Kraken and a few smaller exchanges. Users can track prices on one exchange while trading on another, so if they spot a trend on one particular exchange, they can gain ahead start on another exchange.  Using the service  As mentioned, Haasbot 2.0 is not aimed at mainstream bitcoin users. The target audience is people who understand the markets and trading. However, this does not mean that Haasbot 2.0 is not user-friendly and cannot be used by hobby traders. As always the caveat is, do not trade with any coins you are not prepared to lose.  With three different licence tiers, three standard bot classes and a practically countless combinations of safeties, indicators and insurances that can be assigned to individual bots, getting to grips with Haasbot 2.0 could be problematic for users who have no previous experience with trading bots.  This is one of the reasons Haasonline maintains a very comprehensive wiki, complete with detailed guides, walkthroughs and other useful resources. There’s also a support forum for user inquiries, suggestions and more. The sheer number of options also means that we could not test every scenario in any sensible timeframe. Haasbot 2.0 is a professional trading tool and we simply could not cover the full functionality.  Installation and setup  The new 2.0 update brings a complete overhaul of the UI and an all-new web server interface. The installation process is relatively straightforward and the developers recommend Google’s Chrome browser as the best platform for the Haasbot Trade Server. Once that is installed, it is just a matter of entering licence and API information and you are ready to start trading.  With Haasbot 2.0, you easily keep track of all active bots and set up various notifications, straight from your browser, using a convenient dashboard. The only downside is that mobile functionality remains limited, so if you happen to be on the road you may have a harder time managing your bots.  Creating trade bots, order bots and arbitrage bots is just as easy, it’s a one-click affair, but setting them up and tweaking all the parameters may take a while. Effectively, it all depends on what you want your bots to do – and when.  Script bots are an entirely new feature introduced with Haasbot 2.0 and they are completely customisable and programmable in C#. They do, however, require a bit more time and knowledge to set up.  The latest update also brings a new price comparison feature, along with a white server framework for more accurate and faster price tracking.  Haasbot 2.0 also comes with three new trade indicators: Elliot prediction, Fibonacci and IchiClouds, and is now available in English, German and Dutch languages.  Types of available bots  Haasbot 2.0 offers three basic bot categories, configurable out of the box.  Trade bots use a combination of indicators, safeties and insurances selected by the user to act as a buy or sell signal. The signal is cross-referenced with the current position and the trade is executed if all criteria are met. The bot will also consider the insurances created by the user, as well as safeties.  The most frequently used safeties are Dynamic Drop Loss and Static Drop Loss, which monitor prices for a sudden drop and trigger trades based on thresholds set by the user.  A wide range of indicators is available, depending on the type of licence you choose. The most popular insurance is ‘Overcome Fees’, which ensures that trades are not executed unless the profit is greater than the fee.  Order bots operate depending on a number of conditions or pre-orders. A number of conditions can be combined in a single bot to create customised bots, allowing traders to emulate support and resistance levels.  Arbitrage bots can be employed on exchanges with multiple currency pairs, allowing the trader to generate a profit through exchange rate variations. In such a scenario, the bot is configured to use a base currency and then monitors price differences related to the base currency, allowing automated low-risk transactions.  Configuring bots  There are myriad ways to configure bots, allowing users to create very elaborate strategies, such as virtually interconnecting bots and setting up bots that can automatically take over from less profitable bots in certain scenarios. Of course, this involves significant planning, along with some level of trial and error.  'Backtesting' allows users to see how their trade bots would have performed in action over the last 3 hours to 32 weeks, using historic market data. This feature speeds up the setup and helps remove ambiguities. Backtesting can be used on trading and arbitrage bots.  Users can set various indicators to execute buys or sells, or both. Trade signals can be reversed as well. In case your strategy loses money in backtesting, you can simply reverse the indicators and proceed. Script indicators allow traders with programming skills to devise their own completely customised algorithms.  To set up an arbitrage bot, the user needs to select a base currency in which profits are to be generated. The bot works with three user-selected currency pairs, such as USD/BTC, USD/LTC and BTC/LTC. In periods of high volatility, the bot will be able to find price differences between the pairs and execute trades. The bot automatically takes fees into considerations and will not trade unless profit covers the fee.  Order bots are basically pre-programmed bots allowing users to create buy and sell orders in advance, based on price thresholds. They can also be strung together to form dependencies. Order bots can be dependent on other order bots, ensuring that the most profitable trade is executed. For example, if you have a trade bot set up to sell at $250 and another bot set up to sell at $265, the first bot won’t take action if the second bot is able to sell at a higher price.  Let the trading begin  Since we are dealing with an automated service, there is really not much to report. Everything works as advertised and the end result depends on what you decide to do with your bots.  As you can see, the CoinDesk test bot worked, but did not make a fortune for a number of reasons (limited time and unrealistic setup to name two).  Perhaps the biggest change with the Haasbot 2.0 update is the browser interface, which I found user-friendly and relatively simple to use, given the complexity of the suite. It also adds a bit more functionality, allowing users to control their bots with less effort.  It is also possible to use a VPS (virtual private server) in order to access the interface on mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablets and notebooks.  Pros  The new web interface is user-friendly and looks good. It is a big improvement over Haasbot 1.x in terms of appearance and functionality.  Wide range of indicators and addition of new ones in 2.0 update, along with new features like script bots.  Haasonline tends to keep things personal and is in constant touch with users via its support forum, wiki and direct contact. Developers routinely add features and tweak the platform based on community input, so if you come up with a good idea, the team may well implement it.  Cons  While the web interface is accessible from mobile devices via VPS, support for mobile devices leaves much to be desired. The company is considering developing iOS and Android apps that would provide vital notifications and allow users to shut down bots on the go.  Haasbot 2.0 licences are not cheap. Though this is subjective – depending on how serious you are about trading and how much you are willing to invest, the licences could be either too expensive or a negligible cost considering your potential gains. Once again, this is a specialised platform and it’s not designed for inexperienced users.  Competitors  There are already a few bitcoin trading bots on the market. Some are free, some offer free trial periods, while others use a subscription-based model. CoinDesk took a closer look at a number of trading bots in a feature last June.  These include Butter Bot, CryptoTrader and Acacia Trading, but it’s hard to directly compare the platforms due to a number of reasons. Be that as it may, Haasbot 2.0 tends to offer more functionality than competing solutions, but at a premium price.  Conclusion  Haasbot 2.0 is more than an incremental update, as it offers a number of new features, namely the all-new web interface. The platform also offers three basic types of bots, along with new script bots that can be customised.  The extensive choice of options, safeties, indicators and interactions between the bots allows traders to devise elaborate trading strategies, provided they choose to buy the Advanced licence with no limitations. The downside is the cost of the top-tier licence, but cheaper licences are available too, which means you don’t have to spend much to try the service for a limited time.  It should also be noted that Haasonline was forced to increase pricing due to the low price of bitcoin. Remember, the company does not accept fiat payments.  However, for serious traders used to trading dozens or hundreds of coins on a regular basis, the Advanced licence at 0.45 BTC for three months probably doesn’t sound like much.  Bottom line – Haasonline raised the bar with the Haasbot 2.0 update and the competition has some catching up to do.

42398148,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbShHQ,1422109851,How Bitcoin Could Shake Up B2B Payments,"Bitcoin has made some big gains over the last year in business-to-consumer transactions, with many large retailers such as Microsoft, Dell and Overstock now accepting it as a means of payment.  However, the digital currency hasn’t made that kind of splash in the business-to-business (B2B) world.  Late last year, core developer Jeff Garzik tweeted, musing that it would be nice if someone could put a bit of research into the subject.    Would love to see a case study for using #bitcoin as a replacement for B2B wire transfers and payments. Honest, not fluff. Pros & cons.      — Jeff Garzik (@jgarzik) December 11, 2014      Bitcoin-based transfers between businesses would fix an inefficient system. Wire transfers, which are one of the most common ways for businesses to pay each other, are expensive, because banks have to deal with each other directly for each individual transfer, and they can sometimes take days to process.  An alternative, Automated Clearing House (ACH) transfers, are aggregated into batches by a third party, meaning that banks don’t have to deal with them individually. This often makes them cheaper, but slower. There’s always a trade-off somewhere.  Companies that choose to trade in bitcoin, though, can eliminate fees charged by banks for moving money around the world, because the participants are going outside of the banking system altogether.  It can also be far faster to trade in bitcoin, as even getting six confirmations on the blockchain will still take little more than an hour.  Furthermore, it’s ostensibly easy to make a B2B transaction in bitcoin. If you’re buying, say, car parts from a supplier in another country, then you simply send them the bitcoin, and they send you the parts.  Big savings  This is exactly what Tomcar does. One of the few companies to try bitcoin-based B2B transactions, this Australian car manufacturer makes significant savings in the process, according to managing director David Brim.  “Using bitcoin on business transactions allows us to save on banking charges and international exchange rate costs,” said Brim, adding that Tomcar has saved tens of thousands by paying suppliers in bitcoin.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Brim gave a figure of $20,000 saved, although he claimed $50,000 in the video below:  It isn’t quite that easy, though. For one thing, not a lot of businesses accept bitcoin.  “We only really have three suppliers who accept bitcoin,” said Brim, who tries to persuade his trading partners to use it as much as possible. “Two are based in Israel, and one in Taiwan. We purchase maybe only 2% of the Tomcar vehicle’s parts from these suppliers.”  He tries to make these transactions as much like an electronic bank transfer as possible. Simplicity is important. He has strong supplier agreements, and uses standard commercial terms to ensure that he is protected.  Brim also does his best to escape from the dangers of capital gains taxes, which companies can incur in some jurisdictions if they hold onto the bitcoins that receive.  “We do not hold bitcoin. We only use it as a payment method. We pay all taxes involved in any payments. I have always said that if we are to use bitcoin, we would never hedge or hold the currency as an investment,” said Brim.  He added:  “We make the world’s best all-terrain vehicle, and we need to concentrate on that. Investing in currency, even bitcoin, is not what we do.”  To this end, he uses bitcoin merchant accounts to transfer payments. This also keeps him outside the banking system when making bitcoin transactions. Australian banks, like many others, are extremely conservative when it comes to bitcoin, he said.  One reason that it might be difficult for banks to get involved is that bitcoin isn’t considered a currency in many jurisdictions. Instead, it’s often seen as some other kind of asset.  For Henryk Dabrowski, though, that’s a bonus.  Navigating currency exchange controls  Dabrowski is CEO of investment and management services holding company Alternet. His firm invests in companies that focus on advanced payments technologies and got into the digital currency space in 2014.  Alternet subsidiary Alternet Payment Solutions recently partnered with BitPay to resell its business-to-consumer merchant account services, but Dabrowski has another venture up his sleeve: targeting B2B transactions using cryptocurrencies.  The latest venture targets countries with exchange controls that make it difficult for them to trade in foreign currencies. There are tens of these countries, often but not always in emerging economies, ranging from Argentina to Pakistan.  “In Pakistan you can’t exchange rupees for anything else. You have to register yourself as an import company and you only have a certain quota,” he said, explaining that this is a way for the country to control its currency reserves.  These exchange controls can throttle international trade for businesses operating there. Ideally, they’d simply trade in bitcoin, but if foreign trading parties don’t accept it, then they need an intermediary. That’s where Dabrowski's service comes in.  How it works  A customer in a B2B transaction in a country with foreign exchange controls – say, Pakistan – might want to buy parts from another country (Germany, say). The Pakistani company has rupees, and can’t buy euros from its local financial institutions. But the German firm will only accept Euros, not rupees.  The Pakistani firm approaches an Alternet subsidiary in Panama and buys bitcoins (which Dabrowski calls a 'digital asset') with its rupees.  “The digital asset is then pledged as a currency to a loan in a foreign currency. And through that loan the foreign currency is how the company pays suppliers,” Dabrowski said.  In seven days, the loan defaults, and the bitcoins become the property of the Panamanian subsidiary, which can then sell them to regain its position.  The subsidiary works with a local banking partner to send the foreign currency to the supplier, using the digital currency as an asset linked to the fiat currency for anti money laundering purposes.  This means that the transaction isn't bitcoin all the way. Instead, it's a transaction that goes through the conventional banking system, but which uses bitcoin as a means to provide customers with access to foreign currency services that they wouldn't normally have.  If Alternet’s system can be made to work, he believes that it will free up companies in a variety of exchange-controlled countries to trade legally with those in other countries. It’s one rather complex example of how a B2B transaction involving bitcoin can look, although this one has a specific target audience.  Are we likely to see bitcoin used as a mainstream medium of exchange between businesses in 2015? Probably not. But the use cases are there, and, in time, the business world may see fit to give bitcoin B2B services a try.
