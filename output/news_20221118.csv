42413655,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlADQw,1668814949,Crypto Fund Sino Global Had Deep Ties to FTX Beyond Equity Investment,"Sino Global Capital, one of Asia’s biggest and most well-known crypto investors and led by Matthew Graham, tweeted a statement this week that its “direct exposure to FTX exchange was confined to mid-seven figures held in custody.”  The wording of the statement leaves open the question of how big the firm’s indirect exposure might be – including a portfolio of digital tokens that stood at $129 million as recently earlier this year, according to investor documents; many of those tokens, including the Solana blockchain’s SOL, were among those closely associated with Sam Bankman-Fried, the once-billionaire crypto whiz-kid-turned-pariah who ran FTX.  What's driving the extra scrutiny now is the surfacing of a slide deck – posted on a public website but confirmed as authentic by a person familiar with the matter – that Sino had shopped to investors earlier this year when it was raising a crypto investment fund, with a target of as much as $200 million.  FTX was described in the slide deck as a ""partner"" in the fundraising, with the potential to unlock ""significant strategic value."" As of January, the fund had already raised $90 million, with FTX as an anchor investor.  Sino, in seeking to market its own investing track record, included a detailed list of its own investments – some $129 million of ""mark-to-market investments."" They included Solana's native SOL tokens along with serum (SRM), maps (MAPS), oxygen (OXY) and jet protocol (JET).  Each of those tokens has suffered price declines of 80% or more as Bankman-Fried's crypto empire unraveled, including the recent FTX bankruptcy.  It's not clear if Sino still owns the tokens that made up the proprietary trading book as of January or how much the new fund currently manages or what the fund owns. CoinDesk could not obtain recent documents on the fund detailing performance or the current portfolio.  In the event that the investments haven't liquidated, one concern might be that what little value is left in the token holdings might be eroded further if Sino moved to dump them; the tokens are so thinly traded there likely aren't enough willing buyers at the current, already depressed price.  “There isn't enough liquidity to sell all the tokens,” said Sara Gherghelas, blockchain analyst at DappRadar. “The selling could be possible if the team uses some of their own tokens to provide the liquidity necessary. If this happens, it will cause a drastic decrease in the price.”  The Liquid Value I fund was rolled out in late 2021 at the height of the bull market mania, targeting a raise of $200 million. It was the first time Sino, which previously had invested primarily only as a principal, had turned to outside capital in a formal fund vehicle.  The fund wasn’t publicly available to retail investors, instead shopped around to high net worth individuals.  Bankman-Fried himself was an indirect investor in the Liquid Value I fund's general partner via his trading firm Alameda Research and an entity called Alameda Ventures, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing in February.  Among its principal investments, Sino Global also detailed a $6.8 million portfolio of assets for which there was no available market price. Those included equity stakes in FTX and its American arm, FTX.US.  The slide deck doesn’t say exactly what investments would be made in the new fund, but it does say that the “Liquid Value Fund I could exhibit a similar breakdown” to Sino’s proprietary investments.  Liquid Value Fund I is currently active, according to a filing with a Cayman Islands fund directory, with a registration date of September 2021.  Patrick Loney, the firm’s general counsel and head of investor relations, responded to an email from CoinDesk seeking comment on the Liquid Value I fund, by saying he would get back soon. He cc’d Mona Hamdy, chief strategy officer.  Hamdy said in an email after publication of this report that the outside investment fund does not hold positions similar to the principal holdings detailed in the slide deck. She said that a large focus of the fund's investing efforts has been on infrastructure and gaming.  If the token investment selections in Liquid Value Fund I were similar to the choices that Sino had made for its investment portfolio, that might be a bad sign for the fund because, as is the case with the proprietary portfolio, many of the prices for those tokens have suffered steep declines this year.  Data from CoinGecko shows that MAPS, OXY and JET are very thinly traded in digital-asset markets, with less than $250,000 of daily trading volume.  Ajay Dhingra, head of research and analytics at Unizen, said, “If someone executes a market sell order of 1 million MAPS, it can easily wipe out the buy-side books with slippage of 25-30%.”  Investors wiped out?  Sino said in its statement this week, ""We trusted FTX to be a good actor committed to pushing the industry forward,"" and ""[w]e deeply regret that misplaced trust.""  ""Sino Global Capital is functioning as normal and continues to invest as a fund,"" according to the statement. ""Fund investments have been balanced across ecosystems, and we do not employ leverage or short-term trading strategies.""  But at a basic level, the fund's own strategy and operations were so tightly linked with FTX's that, even apart from any losses, a quick dissociation is likely to be difficult.  It's possible that Sino sold off some of the holdings to take profit or reduce exposure. But even if they were sold before the dramatic downfall of the last two weeks, the returns would be questionable given the price declines earlier this year across crypto markets.  The Tom Brady connection  A person familiar with the matter told CoinDesk that a key pillar of the fund’s marketing was to play up the connections with FTX and Bankman-Fried.  Bankman-Fried’s name and FTX’s logo featured prominently on the January slide deck.  Also touted were FTX’s “rapidly growing brand recognition in the U.S through high-profile sponsorships of Miami Heat Arena, [Major League Baseball] and star athletes including Tom Brady, Steph Curry and Lewis Hamilton.”  Sino’s Graham was initially scheduled to appear on a panel this week on the “outlook for digital assets” at an investment conference in Singapore alongside Matthew Heller, an FTX executive.  A revised agenda showed that the two men were later scrapped from the panel.

42413649,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlADNC,1668814645,Market Wrap: Investors Continue to Learn More About FTX's Mismanagement,"In an essay for CoinDesk, Francine McKenna, a journalist and lecturer in financial accounting at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, laid out a series of missteps in FTX's auditing process.  This article originally appeared in Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Francine McKenna, a journalist and lecturer in financial accounting at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, wrote in an essay for CoinDesk that the blowup of Sam Bankman-Fried's empire was like a meteor striking the crypto world, but foreseeable “if you knew where to look in the audited financial statements.”  McKenna explained that the blowup of Bankman-Fried's empire was like a meteor striking the crypto world, but foreseeable “if you knew where to look in the audited financial statements.”  The first red flag was the existence of two audit firms. “Why hire two different firms rather than one to produce an opinion on consolidated results?” McKenna wrote. “With the benefit of hindsight, we can see it perhaps suggested that Bankman-Fried didn’t want any firm to see the whole picture.”  She questioned FTX’s selection of two small firms, Armanino and Prager Metis, which have little experience auditing large enterprises, instead of Big Four global companies, such as E&Y and KPMG that have a history of working with such clients.  A second red flag for readers of FTX’s 2021 audit reports was that neither Prager Metis nor Armanino “provided an opinion on the FTX US or FTX Trading internal controls over accounting and financial reporting. What was discovered by FTX's new CEO, restructuring expert John J. Ray III, should have been obvious much earlier: ""There were no controls.""  A third red flag that McKenna highlighted was that neither FTX Trading or FTX US paid federal income taxes, although both appeared to be profitable.  The biggest red flag “should have been the number of complex, roundtrip and utterly confounding related-party transactions documented in just these two years,"". The great number of related-party transactions at FTX Trading made the financial analysis quite difficult.  Other News  Bitcoin remained steady snugly above its most recent $16,000 support, as investors continued to shrug off the latest developments from the FTX collapse. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $16,600, roughly flat over the past 24 hours. BTC sank less than 2% for the week. How long markets hold tight is unclear, say analysts.  Ether was almost equally unimpressed by the spreading FTX contagio and changing hands just above its recent $1,200 support, up slightly. The second largest crypto in market value rose a few ticks of a percentage point, although ETH was down almost 5% from a week ago.

Draper who has been an evangelist for bitcoin has said multiple times that he expects the digital asset to hit six figures, and once again, he has taken an opportunity to double down on his predictions. Bitcoin To Reach $250,000 In an interview with Bloomberg, Tim Draper said that he expects the price of bitcoin to actually reach $250,000. His reasoning behind this was that bitcoin has not really trickled down into retail shopping just yet. According to Draper, he believes that when this happens, bitcoin will see the $250,000 price mark, and possibly even higher. Warning a tie sporting the bitcoin symbol, Draper points to the fact that women control 80% of all retail spending, and that it will be this demographic that drives this adoption. He explains that the participation of women in the space was already on the rise with 1 in 6 BTC wallets being owned by women. Then when women start using BTC payments for their retail spendings such as food, shelter, and clothing, and retailers start moving towards bitcoin to capture more profit, Draper expects the price of bitcoin to move quickly to $250,000. This is not the first time that Draper would be giving a $250,000 BTC prediction. Although he did not give a timeline this time around, he had previously said that he expects the digital asset to hit this price in mid-2023. In the same interview, Draper also said that he holds most of his wealth in crypto. BTC Still Holds Promise A good argument for the future of bitcoin and the possibility of seeing six-figure prices is the fact that the cryptocurrency is still relatively young. It only took 12 years for the price to reach $69,000 and has roughly tripled in price every few years. If BTC maintains its historical trend, then the next bull market, a $200,000 price mark would not be out of the question. A tripling of the previous all-time high for the next one would actually put the digital asset just above $200,000 in the next bull market. For now, bitcoin is struggling to mark a bottom through the present bear market. Until a bottom is established, there is no runway for the market to start another bull rally. The bankruptcies of multiple large players have also not helped the digital asset in this regard either.

42413642,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlADCu,1668811160,Decentraland DAO Considers Pausing Grants as FTX Collapse Spotlights Diversification,"The Decentraland DAO – the metaverse platform’s community decision-making tool – is holding a vote on whether to temporarily pause its grants program and reassess its structure.  The proposal, brought to a vote on Wednesday, cites concerns over the diversity of its treasury holdings as well as a lack of clear guidelines for grants. Through the program, any community member can request funding for efforts to improve the platform or implement new features.  “The grants program has shown to be a key aspect and fantastic addition to Decentraland; however, the time might be right to pause and review its current structure, identifying valuable lessons from its shortcomings,” the proposal states.  Specifically, the proposal notes that its DAO treasury holds funds equal to $19.3 million, with 99.1% of those assets held in MANA, Decentraland’s native cryptocurrency, and only 0.9% held in “other” tokens.  In presenting that information, the proposal references failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX and the risks it took before declaring bankruptcy. Last week, CoinDesk revealed that FTX’s sister company, Alameda, held billions of dollars of FTT – the platform’s exchange token – on its balance sheet, which hinted at an unusually close relationship between the two companies and raised questions about its shaky foundations.  “One of the largest lessons we can learn from FTX’s collapse is that overexposing one’s treasuries and assets to a single type of asset as your primary source of funding and liquidity, is a major risk,” the proposal says.  MANA currently trades at $0.41 cents, after losing about 34% of its value in the past month. The proposal states that further grants could put increased sell pressure on the token.  Thus far, the grants program has invested $7.5 million in metaverse initiatives and has funded 124 grants, according to the DAO’s treasury website. The pause would allow the DAO to diversify its treasury, reevaluate the current grants model and work on building a roadmap.  “FTX has shown our entire industry that accountability, diversification, transparency and prudent and active risk management protocols are an absolute necessity that shouldn’t be ignored,” Sean Ellul, co-founder of Web3 architecture firm Metaverse Architects and co-author of the proposal, told CoinDesk.  The DAO set out a plan in February 2020 to slowly increase its treasury by vesting 222 million MANA tokens over the course of 10 years. Thus far, the DAO has vested about 61 million tokens.  The poll closes Monday, and so far, 62% of voters are in favor of the pause.",NEUTRAL,MANA | FTT,EXCHANGE | MANA | REGULATION | FTT,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2022/11/18/decentraland-dao-considers-pausing-grants-as-ftx-collapse-spotlights-diversification,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/40d49e346fea167956edce9d718e52f9fea73ca8-3013x1779.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420872,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtZAT,1668810623,Crypto Market Analysis: Roller-Coaster Week Ends With Bitcoin Volatility Falling,"Bitcoin and ether volatility continued to fall as their average true range (ATR) of price movement fell 14% and 18%, respectively, over the last seven days.  ATR soared by 78% and 56%, respectively, in the days immediately following reports that crypto exchange giant was struggling with severe liquidity problems.  Crypto price stabilization has been a peculiar twist in the ongoing FTX tragedy – unexpected but also reassuring to investors jittery about digital assets’ long-term prospects.  Federal Reserve officials appear to be on the same page, in providing something for everyone  Depending on what you wish to hear, you can find a Fed official to deliver comforting remarks.  Those investors hoping for dovish commentary could cite Federal Reserve Vice Chair Lael Brainard, who said on Monday that it would “probably be appropriate soon to move to a slower pace of rate increases”.  Three days later, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard offered support for hawks, saying that “inflation remains unacceptably high, well in excess of the Federal Open Market Committee target of 2%”  Seekers of a middle ground could turn to Fed Governor Christopher Waller, who this week implied that while inflation is too high, he’s open to a 50 basis point hike in December.  At an uncertain time, where macroeconomic signals continue to often contradict one another, the comments underscore the range of options and uncertainty even among the officials who determine monetary policy. Which of the three options would be best may not be apparent until well after the Fed has chosen one of them.  A few notable developments occurred with pricing relationships  The inverse relationship between BTC and the USD reversed completely. Since June, a move higher in BTC meant a move lower in the Dollar Index (DXY), and vice versa. Since the FTX collapse, BTC and DXY have become strongly correlated. This highlights two points. First of all, correlations can still all go to one during crises. And secondly, as important as macro developments are, a sector’s solvency takes precedence  Momentum for both BTC and ETH appears neutral. This is understandable given current fears about FTX contagion.  BTC has begun an upward climb versus ETH. After falling 7% during the Nov. 10 and Nov. 11 sell-off, bitcoin has risen 3% versus ether as of press time.  ETH continues to burn more supply than it produces. The argument that ETH is now a deflationary asset grows louder each day. Its supply since the transition to proof-of-stake has been declining since October.  Whale Investors added coins to exchanges, and asset managers reduced longs.  Whales, defined as unique BTC addresses with more than 1,000 BTC, have been sending coins to exchanges. This trend should not be ignored, as movement of coins to exchanges is often a signal of future selling.  The most recent Commitment of Traders report said asset managers reduced their long BTC positions for the first time in three weeks. The report reflects data as of Nov. 8, so it captures any movement related to the FTX announcement. According to the COT report, asset managers still remain 81% long and represent 43% of open interest.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | MARKET,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/18/crypto-market-analysis-roller-coaster-week-ends-with-bitcoin-volatility-falling,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fd2474782577a6a9890662d3cf58f74690a5a35b-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The top crypto, which has been reeling since cryptocurrency exchange FTX filed for bankruptcy , traded within a tight range of $15.9K-$17.1K this week, offering some reprieve after the sell-off seen last week . Among crypto proponents, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao told CNBC the industry will emerge better off after the FTX collapse and additional oversight may not have prevented the crisis. Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele said FTX is the opposite of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) as the top crypto's protocol was ""created to prevent Ponzi schemes"". FTX's new CEO John Ray III slammed the ""unprecedented"" management of ex-CEO Sam Bankman-Fried that led to the firm's demise. Ray, who oversaw Enron's bankruptcy, said he'd never seen ""such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information"". Now, regulators are calling for more oversight. The U.S. House Banking Committee is planning to hold a bipartisan hearing next month to scrutinize the FTX collapse. U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Dick Durbin (D-IL) demanded that FTX shed light on its finances . Also, U.S. Treasury secretary Janet Yellen said crypto markets need more effective oversight , while Federal Reserve Vice Chair of Supervision Michael Barr said the U.S. needs to have strong oversight of stablecoins . Cantor Fitzgerald legislative and regulatory actions in the coming months will define the industry for years to come, adding that regulated centralized crypto institutions will be critical for future adoption. The FTX fallout claimed many victims this past week. Genesis Global Capital, the lending business of crypto brokerage Genesis, halted redemptions and new loan originations as withdrawal requests exceeded its current liquidity . Prior to this, Genesis was reportedly seeking a $1B emergency loan from investors. Cryptocurrency lender BlockFi is reportedly preparing to file for bankruptcy protection within days. Hong Kong-based Genesis Block reportedly said it would halt trading services to regain some of its liquidity . Singapore's state investment fund Temasek is preparing to write off its $275M stake in FTX. In other news, Jefferies said bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining was less profitable sequentially in Oct. as the average price of the coin remained flat while network hash rate jumped over 13%. ""Network hash rate remained near historic highs into Nov. despite BTC's price crashing following FTX's collapse,"" it added.

42413643,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlADGe,1668807965,Wall Street Banks Seen as Unlikely Saviors as Crypto Firms Struggle,"It took years for the crypto industry to gain trust – and capital – from the major institutional players on Wall Street. But just as more big traditional players seemed on the cusp of making a move into fast-growing blockchain markets, the messy collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire has renewed comparisons of the digital-asset industry to the Wild West.  As the Welsh poet Robert Williams said, “Trust is the easiest thing in the world to lose, and the hardest thing in the world to get back.”  But one question now is whether big banks might see the crypto industry’s latest troubles as an attractive opportunity to nose into blockchain-based markets.  In May of this year, U.S. banking giant JPMorgan Chase signed two popular crypto exchanges as clients, a sign that Wall Street is starting to accept cryptocurrencies, at least to the extent it sees value in them for its own future.  Might some major banks be looking to step in as savior in times when the industry is struggling, just as John Pierpont Morgan once rescued the banking industry in the early 20th century, prior to the creation of the Federal Reserve? (The Fed, which famously saved Wall Street from collapsing during the financial crisis of 2008, does not stand behind the less-regulated crypto industry.)  Experts say it’s unlikely.  “Banks are the natural enemy of the crypto industry because they both sell purportedly the same product line, so it’s unlikely that they would be willing to step in to assist the industry,” said Dick Bove, Odeon Capital Group chief financial strategist.  In a press statement following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, the Bank Policy Institute, which represents big banks, said that “as FTX files for bankruptcy after failing to secure a bailout, policymakers should ensure they do not embed crypto firms in the heart of the financial system by giving them Fed accounts.""  If they did, ""the next crisis in the crypto-verse could threaten financial stability,” according to the statement.  Not a problem  Banks, however, have gotten increasingly interested and tried to get a foothold in the crypto industry. Besides JPMorgan, crypto-friendly banking institution Silvergate Bank signed over 850 digital currency customers, including 61 exchanges, 541 institutional investors and 248 other customers.  “The banks that are in this business are going to say, ‘It’s not going to cause a problem for us,’ and the ones who aren’t in it will say, ‘We told you so,’ but they’re not going to be of any help,” Bove said.  Silvergate’s stock is down 10% in November, after it announced that it had exposure to failed crypto exchange FTX. As of Sept. 30, the bank had a total of $11.9 billion in deposits from all digital asset customers, of which FTX's was less than 10%.  U.S. exchanges also might be out of the game.  “For heavily U.S.-regulated exchanges, I doubt that Wall Street would be interested,” said Jim Bianco, president and macro strategist at Bianco Research. “For offshore exchanges, their regulator would probably force them to resign if they touched any of them.”  He says traditional banks don’t understand the crypto business well enough to take the risk of jumping in.  Regulators might be reluctant to allow big Wall Street firms to swallow a big crypto firm, with so many officials at the state and federal levels so vocal on the risks from the digital-asset industry. However, Congress has been slow to create a broad regulatory framework that would embrace crypto as part of the existing financial system.  Wall Street banks probably don't mind too much watching the crypto industry founder, Bove said.  “Banks aren’t worried about the crypto industry breaking away” right now, he said. “Just about every major bank knows how to create its own tokens. If it wants into the industry it is not hard to get there. What the banks want is to avoid their core business from being cannibalized.”  CORRECTION (Nov. 18, 2022, 2:54 a.m. UTC): Notes Silvergate's aggregate deposits from digital asset customers and corrects FTX's share of this total.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/18/wall-street-banks-seen-as-unlikely-saviors-of-crypto-as-native-firms-struggle,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a6f6cd8a2007829ce156afbd8a48f2ef90582f83-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

4446709,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4559154-november-technical-update-on-ethereum?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1668807852,November Technical Update On Ethereum,"Summary Crypto sentiment is in the doldrums with recent FTX revelations. ETH has pulled back but maintained support for bullish expectations. Move from the 2018 low appears as of yet incomplete. Produced with Ryan Wilday and Avi Gilburt 2022 has been a challenging year for crypto investors. The past several months have had all the hallmarks of a bear market given all of the incredibly negative developments throughout the crypto space with several major bankruptcies in exchanges going down. Most recently, and perhaps the largest (to date) was the demise of FTX (FTT-USD). And while our larger more immediate bullish thesis in Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has certainly reduced in confidence due to the prolonged break below $24k, Ethereum (ETH-USD) has more closely maintained adherence to larger degree expectations laid out this spring. Let’s review: From April 25th article: Ethereum: A Technical Approach To The Next Year : “That entails substantial downside left in this correction but those who are prepared with cash would be wise to see this as a good risk-to-reward buying opportunity, provided that those investors are prepared for the noted likelihood of volatility.” Price was trading around $2,950 at the time of writing, and forecasted a move down to the $1,200-$1,700 region as a buying opportunity. That said, when the article was written, our expectations for this pullback were that it would be a wave 4 within a larger wave (3). Considering the June low saw price break well below $1,200, approximately $880 across exchanges, we have now moved towards considering a higher degree pullback in ETH. That is, this pullback is being considered a wave (4) rather than a 4 of (3). Where does that put us in a larger context? When the April article was written, it was noted that price had formed 3 waves up from the 2018 low but that wave (3) had not yet completed. Again, due to the depth of this pullback, the odds have strongly shifted to the all-time highs having completed the wave (3). All that to say, we still have just 3 waves up from the 2018 low in an otherwise impulsive structure, which thus strongly suggests there’s one more high still to come. So long as price is holding support for a prospective (4), this thesis is intact. Larger degree support for (4) is $787-$1,058, and so far we have a substantial bounce from that region. Additionally, should price print lower lows beneath those struck in June, I could allow for a test of the $660 region, but any meaningful break below that will leave us with a reliable prospect for a higher high in wave (5). In other words, a meaningful or sustained break beneath $660 would likely dash our expectations for the wave (5) higher. In accord with the larger degree bullish expectations, price formed a micro 5 wave rally from the June lows, providing the first potential indication of a low having been struck for wave (4). The subsequent retrace has become quite deep, and as of writing this article, it is reasonably threatening a retest of the June lows. At the smaller degree, so long as price remains over $995-$1k, expectations are for upside follow through. Should price break $995 resoundingly, it’s quite likely that the June low will be tested and likely broken. Please note the fractal similarity (See charts below, in particular the circled sections), albeit at different scales to the move off the December 2018 low into the June 2019 high and subsequent retrace. Both the rallies and declines show very similar wave structure as well as the depth of the wave (2) / 2. The March 2020 low similarly challenged the thesis as to whether Ethereum would maintain a viable (1)-(2) from the 2018 low. What’s needed to more confidently establish the bullish thesis? Price needs an impulsive rally back above the late October high for starters. Five waves up, first exceeding $1,680, and then $2,030 (the August 2022 high) would be a very positive development towards bulls emphatically taking control. The next step would be for the price pattern to maintain micro supports along the way and breakout above $3k. Currently, if we have a low in place for wave 2, the 1.0-1.236 extension comes in at $2,465-$3,005. If ETH is going to prove it’s headed to new highs, this region obviously will need to be retaken. That said, even in a very bullish scenario, it’s likely that this region would reject price upon the first test from below. Once price takes out the August high, the relevant support will be roughly $1,750-$1,800. It’s necessary for that region to contain any declines from above $2,030 to maintain a confident bullish perspective. Given the depth of this pullback into the 2022 low, our upside expectations have somewhat dampened. The minimum upside target - assuming conditions are met for holding wave (4) support - is $6,350. That said, cryptos have a tendency (generally) to extend in their wave 5s and so I can not rule out a trip up to $16k. Lastly, considering the bounce from the November lows is rather anemic thus far, we would be remiss to not be on the lookout for prospective lower lows. In the coming days, if price takes out $1k and heads to $660, even if that region holds, our confidence in price recovering to new all-time highs will be somewhat shaken. A bounce is expected from that region but at this time, I can not rule out the possibility that such a bounce, from $600-$660 is just a corrective ((B)) before a much more significant downside develops as shown in purple.

Don't confuse the two. Reports of Bitcoin's death have been greatly exaggerated. Search interest in ""Bitcoin is Dead"" has spiked following the collapse of FTX. History tells us we're close to a bottom. On-chain metrics look phenomenal. Non-zero addresses are approaching 44 million and exchange supply is at a two year low. We're now a little over a week removed from arguably the biggest calamity in crypto this year. And that's saying something because 2022 has been pretty awful for crypto proponents and Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) advocates. We are now 53 weeks past Bitcoin's cycle top of just under $69,000. Since then, we've seen the fall of Terra ( LUNC-USD ), the collapse of Celsius Network ( CEL-USD ), and too many insolvencies between the lending and mining companies to list. FTX (FTT-USD) probably hits the hardest because of how big it became. Stadium naming rights, endorsement deals, high profile ambassadors, millions of users, and a lot of exchange volume; it stings in a big way and it's a black eye on the industry. But with some time to digest it all, it is imperative that we not conflate the failings of a centralized company in the world of finance with the failing of decentralized crypto networks. They are not the same. With the exception of Terra, which was highly centralized in its operations, every other collapse in the crypto industry this year has been by a centrally controlled and managed business. The calls for regulation are going to get loud. In my opinion, whatever kneejerk decision comes out of the regulatory body will not matter - regulations wouldn't have stopped FTX. But for the sake of this article, I want to explore the idea that Bitcoin is somehow doomed because of the fall of one centralized exchange. So far, nothing could be further from the truth. Is Bitcoin Dead? Spoiler, it's not. There's actually a webpage dedicated to tracking how many times a notable media outlet or writer has declared Bitcoin dead. So far, Bitcoin has been declared dead 466 times since 99bitcoins started tracking submissions from 2010. 99bitcoins/BCR Looking at the deaths by year we can see two notable things; the first is there were far more proclamations of Bitcoin's demise in 2017 than there were in 2021. The second thing we notice is death calls were far more abundant when Bitcoin topped in 2017 than when it bottomed in 2020. Even after a new high several multiples above the 2017 top in 2021, we see far fewer death declarations in 2021 and even less in 2022. However, the 99bitcoins obituary tracker isn't a perfect science because it's submission based. Something that might be a bit more actionable could be search data. What do real people actually think? We can get a sense of retail investor sentiment by looking at Google Trends: Bitcoin is Dead Index (Google Trends, Yahoo/BCR) This chart shows the ""Bitcoin is Dead"" search index for both the United States and Worldwide. They track tightly together for the most part. When overlaying Bitcoin's price we can see the spikes in the ""Bitcoin is Dead"" search indices is actually closer to bottoms than tops. Furthermore, in the last bull cycle, there was the immediate surge in death search in January of 2018 followed almost a full year later by another spike in the ""Bitcoin is Dead"" search index after a big capitulation. While the spikes from this cycle look a bit different, we're in our second spike now. History indicates when people stop wondering if Bitcoin is dead, that's when the bull will begin. Network activity Despite all of the chaos surrounding the collapse of FTX and the terrible sentiment, Bitcoin doesn't care. It just keeps making blocks and hashrate is still churning out new highs seemingly each week: BTC Hashrate (Bitinfocharts) To reiterate, this is a measurement of the computing power that is being committed to securing the network. If Bitcoin were dead, we'd see this figure collapsing. It's doing the opposite. Also, if Bitcoin were dead we'd probably be seeing BTC inflow to exchanges for dollar conversions rather than exchange outflow. We're seeing outflow: BTC Exchange Balance (Messari/BCR) Whether you're in the Bitcoin-only camp or not, the FTX collapse appears to have created new self-custody maximalists. The supply of BTC on exchange has plummeted from 1.56 million at the end of September to 1.26 million today. The exchange supply balance hasn't been this low since 2020 when the run in BTC price really started to accelerate. To be clear, I'm not suggesting we'll see a big price move up soon. This time we don't have the same macro setup that we did in 2020. But if Bitcoin were dead, we'd see more of it coming onto exchange rather than leaving. 0.001 BTC Minimum Balances (CoinMetrics) Non-zero BTC balances are quickly approaching 44 million wallet addresses. We can see similar growth trends among a wide range of address balance minimums as well. In the chart above, we can see addresses with at least 0.001 BTC, or roughly $16.5, have spiked from 21.5 million on November 8th to 22.2 million today - a 3% surge in just 10 days. This is a good indicator that even lower stack-value holders are getting the point about self-custody. Puell Multiple and NVT Valuation One of the ways that we can try to guess where Bitcoin's price will go is with the Peull Multiple. What this chart is measuring is Bitcoin's daily issuance measured in dollars and dividing that figure by a one year moving average of the issuance value. Puell Multiple (LookIntoBitcoin) Generally when we see the multiple find the green zone it means there is more pressure on miners to sell the issuance. The multiple has been in the green for essentially 5 consecutive months. When the multiple is this depressed for this long, it has typically been an indicator a bottom is close or in and miners no longer need to sell issuance to pay the bills. History doesn't repeat but it might rhyme. NVT 90 Day MA (CoinMetrics) Something else to consider is the NVT ratio or the Net Value to Transactions ratio. This ratio was created by Bitcoin analyst Willy Woo and has often been a strong buy indicator when the ratio is very low. What this ratio aims to show is the valuation of Bitcoin based on how much it is being used for transactions. During the June selloff, the NVT ratio actually went below 20 - which did not happen following the 2018 selloff and was actually the lowest the ratio had been since 2011. None of this means these ratios can't go lower, but if one wants to be strategic with purchases, buying when the ratio is as low as it is now has yielded good results in the past. Risks The biggest risk to Bitcoin is criminalization by decree. Even that won't kill Bitcoin but it would be a significant blow and would likely severely damage consumer interest in acquiring and holding it. There is precedent for the US government doing something like that with Gold. In 1933, FDR signed Executive Order 6102 making the hoarding of Gold illegal. Of course, US citizens are allowed to hold Gold once again but that came after a significant re-pricing. Importantly, the US is just one jurisdiction and there are certainly reasons why other countries have and may continue to take a more opportunistic approach to BTC. BTC: Country Holdings (BuyBitcoinWorldwide) The other major risk to Bitcoin is that it is reliant on the internet to be used while other traditional fiat escape assets like Gold and Silver are not. There is no denying that fact. But if a significant enough portion of the world loses electricity to the point that Bitcoin's ledger is no longer available, humanity would have far bigger problems than debating investment assets. Summary With respect to Charlie Munger and his abysmal take on Bitcoin, if a currency that helps kidnappers should be avoided I have some bad news for him about USD. BTC can't simultaneously be worth nothing and also be used for facilitating crime. Which is it? Bitcoin antagonists have to choose. Is it worth nothing or is it potentially so valuable to non-western nations that it threatens to end the dollar system as we currently know it? Maybe a better question is does a network of decentralized computers tasked with maintaining a public ledger care what anyone thinks? If you're bearish Bitcoin long term, fine. I'm not going to try to sway you. If you're bullish Bitcoin long term, keep dollar cost averaging and you'll do just fine. Are we at a bottom in Bitcoin? I doubt it. But I think we're much closer to the bottom than the top and I think this Bitcoin bear cycle is closer to the end than the beginning. The network is still strong.

Enron liquidator shocked at FTX books. What does the fallout mean for regulation? Let's talk about the Tether audit. In recent cryptocurrency articles, I discussed that institutional confidence in the cryptocurrency market was lost with the collapse of decentralized finance firms. That has only gotten worse with the collapse of the trusted FTX (FTT-USD) exchange. In this article, I will talk about the implications for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and the path ahead. FTX collapse is a huge setback for crypto The swift and stunning collapse of the FTX exchange has far-reaching consequences for the cryptocurrency industry and the contagion may not be over. It was reported this week that FTX had up to 1 million creditors and a former liquidator of Enron said he had "" never seen anything like this "". FTX was said to be publishing a list of its top 50 creditors at the end of this week. The problems at FTX started after Coindesk published an article about FTX's crypto hedge fund Alameda Research. The article said: ""As of June 30, the company’s assets amounted to $14.6 billion. Its single biggest asset: $3.66 billion of 'unlocked FTT.' The third-largest entry on the assets side of the accounting ledger? A $2.16 billion pile of 'FTT collateral.'There are more FTX tokens among its $8 billion of liabilities: $292 million of 'locked FTT.' (The liabilities are dominated by $7.4 billion of loans)"". What followed will go down in crypto infamy. The rival Binance (BNB-USD) exchange, whose CEO Changpeng Zhao had apparently been angered at FTX lobbying against his firm, decided to pull the plug on $500m of FTT holdings. That led to a huge wave of $8 billion in crypto withdrawals from FTX and a Binance takeover offer. That was dependent on due diligence and after one look at the toxic books, Zhao said “The issues are beyond our control or ability to help”. The contagion may not be over after investment bank JP Morgan (JPM) predicted that Bitcoin could drop to $13,000 in the weeks ahead with a ""cascade"" of margin calls. “We had argued last week that, similar to what we saw after the collapse of TerraUSD last May, the current deleveraging phase that started with the collapse of Alameda Research and FTX is likely to reverberate for at least a few weeks inducing a cascade of margin calls, deleveraging and crypto company/platform failures,” analysts said . Enron liquidator says the FTX books are 'unprecedented' In court filings from FTX, it emerged that the company could have up to 1 million creditors. The contagion continued this week with trading and lending arms linked to the Genesis exchange caught up in the fallout. One of the ironies of this is that Genesis is owned by Digital Currency Group (DCG) which also owns Coindesk- the website that first exposed the FTX balance sheet. Another company caught up in the liquidity problems was BlockFi, which had been the subject of a $400 million bailout by FTX and its CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, in the summer. A move that saw Forbes laud him as the cryptocurrency equivalent of John Pierpont Morgan in the 1907 stock crash. Four months later and his empire had collapsed with FTX's new CEO and liquidator, John Ray III, who also oversaw the liquidation of Enron, saying ""Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here."" He added: ""From compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated, and potentially compromised individuals, this situation is unprecedented."" That last statement highlights the real problem with cryptocurrency projects now. Institutional money will continue to stay away and regulators will step up their efforts to protect investors. According to Ray, “only a fraction” of the FTX assets have been recovered thus far. The liquidators have found around $740 million of cryptocurrency, compared to the $10-$50 billion in liabilities the company noted in bankruptcy filings. The FTX fallout will bring new regulatory scrutiny The collapse of FTX has now seen lawmakers calling for swift regulation on the cryptocurrency sector. A spokesperson for Australia's Treasurer Jim Chalmers said that regulations to further protect investors will be introduced next year, according to AFR. In the U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee said: ""FTX's bankruptcy and the many other recent instances of instability have proved why we need a comprehensive regulatory approach that protects consumers and our economy from the risks of crypto"". The problem for Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency sector is that investors have always been expecting regulatory action in the near future. Now they have to deal with the potential financial instability of firms run by ""inexperienced, unsophisticated"" financiers, and institutional investor trust could be slow to earn. The Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler met with the former CEO of FTX in March of this year. Congress is now questioning the reason for the meeting, which was said to be seeking an SEC-approved crypto exchange. That could've been a big humiliation for the SEC, but it highlights how the regulators have been focused on the wrong area. The SEC has been going after Ripple (XRP-USD), and lately Binance, questioning whether their coin offerings should be classed as securities. Now there will be a lot more scrutiny about what companies are holding on their balance sheet. The long-awaited Tether (USDT-USD) audit could be big The Tether stablecoin could be a problem for the cryptocurrency industry. The project responded to a previous WSJ article saying that it would undergo a full audit. However, that was expected to be ""months away"" at the end of August and now we have seen the implications of a shaky balance sheet. The WSJ claimed that the stablecoin had not seen an audit since 2017 and that a 0.3% decline in assets would “render it technically insolvent.” Tether is the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap with $65 billion in tokens underpinning a huge part of the entire industry. A trend emerging from the FTX fallout has been the move to cold storage wallets. Binance's CEO said “self-custody is a fundamental human right” and its Trust Wallet token rallied 150% in six days as investors look to get some of their tokens off exchanges. That was also driven by Elon Musk, who said: “I would reaffirm that, if you have crypto, you should have it in a directly-accessible cold wallet. Not in an exchange”. There is now some added scrutiny over exchanges and stablecoins which adds a further headwind to the cryptocurrency sector. Investors should wait for clarification on the FTX creditor situation. The collapse of one of the most trusted exchanges now exposes the whole sector. Conclusion The so-called cryptocurrency winter has been punishing for Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency sector. The collapse of decentralized finance deposits could have been blamed in part on the sharp rise in central bank interest rates. The latest collapse of FTX is brazen financial mismanagement and has shone a light on the entire sector. I warned subscribers of my weekly newsletter in early October that the weakness under $20k could see a ""dump lower"" in BTC. That happened with the FTX collapse and we now have further headwinds in the sector that can see Bitcoin heading for support around the $10k level. Sentiment in the sector is at a low and there is potential for further FTX contagion with $9-50 billion still missing for up to 1 million creditors. Regulatory scrutiny will harden and we will also see calls for the likes of Tether to share their balance sheets.",NEGATIVE,BTC | FTT,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | FTT,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4559135-bitcoin-ftx-fallout-further-lows-ahead?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4445296.jpeg
42421426,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoDG9,1668805470,Say Goodbye to Proprietary Tax Prep Software,"The average American pays $294 to file taxes each year. These fees equate to roughly $11.3 billion per year in revenue for tax prep companies. In the crypto world, the costs of tax filing can be many multiples more than traditional tax preparation as it usually requires more time, software and specialized professionals to assist.  Megan Knab is CEO of Franklin, a crypto-native payroll company. This article is part of CoinDesk’s Tax Week.  However, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and state tax authorities already have the majority of our wage information reported to them every pay period by employers. Why, then, do W2 workers need to send back forms with information the tax authorities already have?  For years, tax-help giant Intuit quietly lobbied against the Return Free Tax System, an initiative from the IRS dating back to the 1990s, in order to build their own self-hosted, free system for taxpayers to file. Instead of this governmental service, Intuit and other tax preparation software providers agreed to offer a free version of their software for low-income Americans.  However, through deceptive up-charging (like only offering federal filing for free and charging for each state tax) as well as tricky user design, these “free programs” easily add up to over $200 per filing.

Today, there is massive competition among decentralized tax help providers to expand both support in terms of chains as well as automating reconciliation and profit/loss calculations.

42413641,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlADEm,1668804523,‘Grayscale Discount’ Widens to Record 43% as FTX Contagion Spreads,"Shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the world’s largest publicly traded crypto fund, are trading at a new record discount of 43% relative to the price of the underlying bitcoin (BTC).  Crypto analysts are speculating as to the reason, but the added pressure comes after Genesis Global Capital, an arm of Digital Currency Group (DCG), owner of Grayscale Investments, which manages GBTC, announced this week that it would halt customer withdrawals from its lending unit – stemming from the fallout from the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX crypto empire. (CoinDesk is an independent subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, known as DCG.)  Grayscale Investments reassured investors on Wednesday that the Genesis was “not a counterparty or service provider for any Grayscale product,” and that Grayscale products would “continue to operate business as usual.”  The GBTC shares have not traded at a premium to the underlying bitcoin since March 2021, according to data from Coinglass, and the discount has widened this year along with distress in crypto markets and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission refusal to allow a conversion of the fund into an exchange-traded fund.  GBTC is an investment vehicle that allows U.S. investors to gain exposure to price movements of BTC without buying the asset itself. The crypto fund Three Arrows Capital was a large holder of GBTC, and told Bloomberg in July that arbitrage trading the premium was one of the factors that led to its collapse earlier this year.  For some investors, the recent widening of the discount may have made the vehicle even more attractive: Bloomberg reported that Cathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management bought more than 315,000 shares worth roughly $2.8 million of GBTC shares earlier this week.  This week's move by Genesis has sparked speculation online that Grayscale might alter its current strategy, which consists of keeping the fund going while simultaneously suing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over the agency’s rejection of the ETF conversion.  According to QCP Capital, many observers are now expecting DCG to ""use the most liquid part of the business – Grayscale – to shore up Genesis and other parts of the business.""  “We had written off a potential sale of GBTC’s BTC assets in our 2022 year outlook, although we never expected it to be under such circumstances,” said QCP in a note Friday.  The friction is that Grayscale would then have to give up rights to a contractual stream of fees, currently 2% of assets under management.  There's also the question of DCG's own holdings of GBTC. In October 2021, DCG said in an announcement it had purchased $388 million worth of GBTC shares.  QCP said that “those expecting GBTC to allow a one-off redemption for Genesis to meet liquidity needs are misguided, as this has to be done with the [Securities and Exchange Commission's] approval.”  “With all of the SEC's opposition to GBTC this year, we certainly don't expect this to happen anytime soon,"" QCP wrote. ""On the bright side this also means a low chance of a large one-off BTC selling pressure from this.”  Neither Grayscale Investments nor Digital Currency Group responded to CoinDesk’s request for comment.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/18/grayscale-discount-widens-to-record-43-as-ftx-contagion-spreads,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/becb7bde1b86ea50c748d3d647e22570c448eb65-1824x592.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The arrangement was previously undisclosed, with Bankman-Fried telling investors at the time it was partially to reimburse him for money he’d spent to buy out Binance’s stake in FTX a few months earlier, the Journal reported.  In July 2021, Bankman-Fried bought out the approximately 15% of FTX owned by Binance, which was FTX’s first investor. Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao tweeted this month that the amount of the buyout was $2.1 billion in Binance’s stablecoin BUSD and FTX’s exchange token FTT.  The October 2021 funding round valued FTX at $25 billion and raised money from financial heavyweights such as BlackRock, Tiger Global, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund Temasek and Sequoia Capital. A few months later, some of those same investors helped raise $400 million for FTX's U.S. subsidiary at an $8 billion valuation.  According to the Journal, it was unclear what Bankman-Fried did with the $300 million, while FTX's 2021 audited financial statements said the money was being kept by the company for ""operational expediency"" on behalf of a ""related party.""

The native token of the Chiliz blockchain (CHZ), which powers the largest sports fan token creator platform Socios.com, has surged 11% in the past 24 hours.  Fan tokens for the national soccer teams of Portugal (POR) and Argentina (ARG), both major contenders to win the Cup, “will be the cherries on top during the World Cup,” the research team of crypto exchange Huobi wrote in a report Thursday.  POR has rallied 15% over the past 24 hours and is up 50% during the previous week, while ARG has pocketed a 10% daily and 28% weekly gain, according to FanMarketCap, a fan token price tracker.  The total market capitalization of fan tokens increased 11% in the last 24 hours to $399 million, data by CoinGecko shows.  Fan tokens are cryptocurrencies that represent membership to a community, for example a sports team’s fan base. Token holders can express their support to a team, while they receive specific perks, including game tickets or even some level of participation in a sports club’s decision-making.  The rally precedes the kickoff of soccer’s most important event, the quadrennial World Cup on Sunday in Qatar.

SBF was said to have sold some his personal stake in FTX at the time in a move that ultimately allowed him to receive profits prior to investors. The founder of FTX, which was then valued at $25B, justified his cashout as a ""partial reimbursement of money he spent to buy out rival Binance’s stake in FTX a few months earlier,"" some of the people familiar with the transaction said, as quoted by The WSJ . FTX last year raised money for some six months and raked in roughly $2B from big-money investors, The WSJ noted, including Sequia Capital, funds managed by asset management giant BlackRock ( BLK ), and Singapore's state investment fund Temasek. But the days of FTX's prosperity came to an abrupt end after traders withdrew their funds en masse last week upon discovery of an $8B funding gap. FTX and its more than 130 affiliates then filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and SBF stepped down from his CEO role. FTX's new boss, John Ray III, highlighted an array of poor management practices under SBF's leadership in a court filing earlier this week, including “the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals.” The filing also suggested that Alameda Research, an affiliated quant trading firm of FTX, loaned out $4.1B to related parties, $1B of which went directly to SBF. Alameda was a key player in the demise of FTX as the latter was said to have lent more than half of its customer assets to the former. It's yet to be determined what SBF did with his $300M, but FTX's audited financial statement last year indicated the company kept the money for ""operational expediency,"" The WSJ reported.

Bitcoin (BTC) was recently trading at around $16,600 Friday, roughly unchanged over the past 24 hours. Ether (ETH) was recently changing hands at about $1,200 and was also flat from Thursday, same time.  Over the past seven days, BTC and ETH have declined 1.5% and ETH 4.8%, respectively.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, barely moved as investors continued to absorb recent events stemming from crypto exchange giant FTX’s filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last Friday and the latest revelations about its mismanagement.  A note Friday by Coinbase Institutional attributed bitcoin and ether’s resilience in recent days to its “relatively limited” exposure on FTX’s balance sheet, creating a buffer for potential mass liquidations.  “The recent performance of these assets may also reflect implicit recognition that the events at FTX were credit driven, not crypto driven in nature,” Coinbase Head of Institutional Research David Duong and Research Analyst Brian Cubellis wrote in the note.  However, other crypto observers maintain that the continued domino effect following FTX’s fallout is still difficult to gauge. The crypto market capitalization has fallen to under $800 billion, its lowest level since early 2021.  Crypto asset trading firm QCP wrote in a Telegram note Friday that BTC and ETH have been unable to join the huge post-Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data short squeeze staged by global risk assets.  The firm said that the underperformance of all crypto assets will remain “until the bulk of uncertainly has cleared up – likely only near the turn of the new year.”  “This changes completely our previous view of a wave four-year-end macro rally that will be led in crypto by ETH,” the group added.  ‘Hodlers’ accumulate  Despite overall bearish sentiment, crypto data and analysis firm IntoTheBlock’s on-chain data shows that BTC long-term holders increased their holdings by 180,000 BTC, close to $3 billion, since the FTX collapse.  Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock, said that historically BTC long-term holders “accumulate strongly in the depths of the bear market” and “begin selling following all-time highs.”  “I would say that is most likely the main strategy Bitcoin believers are aspiring to recreate based on this on-chain data,” Outumuro told CoinDesk.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/18/bitcoin-holds-fast-over-16k-but-crypto-winter-could-be-prolonged,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b5270a9be1befcd03005d514c6963b9239a5dd11-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414852,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBTWpY,1668799703,Cardano Is Launching New Privacy Blockchain and Token,"Input Output Global (IOG), the firm behind the Cardano blockchain, is releasing a new privacy-focused blockchain called Midnight and a token called dust to accompany the new network.  Midnight, which is underpinned by zero-knowledge proof technology, is one of many side chains now being deployed around Cardano, and will go beyond previous privacy-coin projects by delivering zero-knowledge proof smart contracts, IOG CEO Charles Hoskinson said during an event at Edinburgh University in Scotland on Friday.  The system will walk the line between preserving privacy and allowing regulators and auditors a backdoor into the system when permission is granted, he said.  “Midnight has evolved privacy-coin technology where everything was anonymous by default, which is what zcash and monero did with Snarks and ring signatures,” Hoskinson said in an interview with CoinDesk, referring to two other privacy coins and their encryption methods.  “This is a completely new way of writing and running private smart contracts and private computation. So you can have a private DEX (decentralized exchange) or go mine an anonymous data set or these types of things.”  Privacy coins have always been lionized by crypto libertarians, but have been viewed warily by regulators fearful of how the technology might help facilitate financial crime. Yet, privacy is something that every business has a legal requirement to explore these days, Hoskinson said, although he noted that the difficulty of figuring out how to add privacy to blockchains has prevented its adoption.  “You need programmability; you can’t just take Zcash and fork it, and somehow it’ll work,” Hoskinson said of the protocol. “What was needed was the ability to write this stuff in a normal programming language, not some weird Snark thing, but JavaScript or something like that, something developers can understand and get a guarantee you have privacy.”  A paper published two years back by IOG, titled ""Kachina,"" which dives into privacy-enhanced smart contracts, is now coming to fruition in the real world, Hoskinson said. This has generated interest within the once-hyped world of enterprise blockchains, he added, explaining that Midnight will be working with Hyperledger, for example, which is a consortium of large firms exploring private and permissioned ledgers for things like supply-chain management.  “This is what the enterprise absolutely wants, and we have seen Walmart and some of the largest companies in the world working on privacy with Hyperledger,” Hoskinson said. “At the same time, we can service traditional cryptocurrency needs, especially when you look at DEXs that want to prevent front-running and these types of things.”",POSITIVE,없음,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | ZEC,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/11/18/cardano-is-launching-new-privacy-blockchain-and-token,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/34e73647d8b6da5ce7c4b03e57e4b7e1afcb05a2-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The utility token saw a price increase of 4.24% on the day. It also enjoyed an impressive 11% surge in the last 7 days. LEO’s price surge comes as rival exchange FTX suffers from liquidity issues. After the FTX filed for bankruptcy, many crypto community members called for exchanges to post their proof of reserves. Bitfinex was one of the few exchanges that revealed their cold wallet storage to boost transparency. Related Reading: Is Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao To Blame For FTX Collapse?

Besides LEO, the likes of Trust Wallet Token, Chiliz, and Toncoin are soaring with daily and weekly gains. Topping the list of top-gainers in the past day and week is Trust Wallet Token. The native token of the self-custody wallet saw an impressive run that brought its total weekly value to over 90%. TWT’s impressive run comes after CZ of Binance endorsed the wallet on Twitter. Taking second place is the utility token of the decentralized spot and perpetual trading platform GMX. The token saw a week-on-week surge of 20% at press time while holding 2.09% on the day. Toncoin ad Chiliz followed suit in third and fourth place, respectively. Both tokens have enjoyed renewed interest on social media, one key factor contributing to their surge. LEO came in fifth place, posting an intraday price surge of 4.21%. The Bitfinex utility token experienced some volatility within the week. This pushed the token down to $3.66, a 4.9% drop below its 7-day opening price of $3.82. However, it has recovered the losses, reaching a new local high of $4.22. Bitfinex CTO Publishes Proof Of Reserve Amid FTX Bankruptcy Saga Many significant cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance, OKX, Kucoin, and Crypto.com, committed to publishing their proof of reserve to restore investor trust. The development came after FTX’s liquidity issue became well-known in the crypto space.

A total of 135 cold and hot wallet addresses were disclosed in Ardoino’s Bitfinex proof of reserves post on GitHub.

Other cryptocurrencies in the top 10 by the market are following a similar trajectory and are trending to the downside. Bitcoin Market At Risk Of Further Downside? In the collapse of FTX, many companies have had to declare bankruptcy. Contagion is spreading across the nascent industry, which might affect major players, including the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), run by Digital Currency Group (DGC). The FTX fallout impacted one of DGC’s subsidiaries, crypto lender Genesis. Yesterday, this company halted new withdrawal requests from its customers, citing a liquidity crunch triggered by FTX’s downfall. The company stated: The default of 3AC negatively impacted the liquidity and duration profiles of our lending entity Genesis Global Capital. Since then, we have been de-risking the book and shoring up our liquidity profile and the quality of our collateral (…). FTX has created unprecedented market turmoil, resulting in abnormal withdrawal requests which have exceeded our current liquidity. Genesis’ parent company DCG claims it was unaffected by recent events. However, there are speculations about a possible capitulation event within the investment firm and its other subsidiaries, including the GBTC. One of the largest Bitcoin holders in the world with over 600,000 BTC valued at over $13 billion and 3 million ETH valued at $3.7 billion, if Grayscale or DCG become forced sellers, the crypto market will likely see fresh lows. According to the rumors shared by a member of the crypto community: We’re hearing semi-credible rumors that Genesis may be having solvency issues (…). We are aware that Grayscale controls GBTC and ETHE, not Genesis. DCG (the parent company of Genesis and Grayscale) is backstopping Genesis, and dissolving the trusts may be necessary if there is a solvency issue, and if it is big enough.

42411676,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfEpD,1668798240,"Top 5 Crypto Tax Questions, Answered","Tax filing day may be months away, on April 18, 2023, to be exact. But, if you’ve bought, sold, traded, earned or lost cryptocurrency this year, now is the time to prepare.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Tax Week.  CoinDesk spoke to tax experts to answer the most commonly asked questions about crypto and taxes in the U.S.  How does the IRS know you own crypto?  Cryptocurrencies including non-fungible tokens (NFTs), are treated as “property” for the purposes of tax in the United States, originally decided by the Internal Revenue Services (IRS) in 2014. This means that a majority of taxable actions involving digital assets will incur capital gains tax treatment, similar to how stocks are taxed.  In 2022, there are two main ways the federal agency keeps track.  The first is through self-reporting. The U.S. Individual Income Tax Return form, known as Form 1040 asks if at any time during the past year “did you receive, sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of any financial interest in any virtual currency?” Each filer must answer with by checking a box for “Yes” or “No.”  “That is the first line of defense that the IRS uses,” said David Kemmerer, Co-Founder and CEO of CoinLedger. “Every taxpayer has to answer that under penalty of perjury.”  The anonymous nature of cryptocurrency makes it hard for the IRS to learn about a given taxpayer’s crypto transactions. To get around this, they’ve turned to the legal system.  And that’s the second way – a “John/Jane Doe Summons.”  This summons compels crypto brokerages to share user data with the federal agency, so that data can be used to identify, audit and prosecute taxpayers avoiding paying their share of taxes on crypto gains.  “The IRS is getting better by requesting information from the broker dealer houses that transact on this type of activities,” says ​​Mark Steber, the chief tax information officer at Jackson Hewitt.  They’ve previously served such summons on companies like Kraken and Circle to confirm whether the firms’ customers are properly reporting their taxes.  Once the ball drops on 2022, crypto broker dealers will be mandated to report their customers’ transactions during 2023 and every subsequent year to the IRS, as a result of the U.S. Infrastructure Bill that was passed in November 2021.  How much do you have to pay in taxes?  Calculating how much cryptocurrency tax you owe in the U.S. is based on how long you’ve held the assets prior to disposing of them, as well as which income tax bracket you fall under.  Short-term capital gains: If you hold cryptocurrencies for 12 months or less, your capital gains rate is the same as your ordinary income tax rate, which is dependent on your total income.  Long-term capital gains: If you hold cryptocurrencies for 12 months or more, the capital gains tax is much lower than short term. Most filers will not pay more than the 15% rate.  Read More: Crypto Capital Gains and Tax Rates 2022  Can you write off a crypto loss?  Yes.  “A lot of people’s portfolios are probably in the red now,” said Kemmerer. “So, you’d be prudent to lock in your capital losses on your assets.”  Capital losses can be used to offset any capital gains tax to reduce your overall tax bill.  Here’s an example:  Earlier in 2022, you made a purchase of bitcoin. You then sold it and landed a nice $10,000 gain. That profit is your capital gains and will be taxed. However, you saw that Elon Musk tweeted a picture of a Shiba Inu dog and dogecoin started pumping. You bought dogecoin at the top, right before it started dropping once again. You’ve got a $3,000 loss in the meme token.  Before the clock strikes midnight on Dec. 31, 2022, you sell your dogecoin at a loss and convert it to cash. You can now take that $3,000 loss to offset your $10,000 gain from the bitcoin purchase you’ve made when the markets were at a happier time.  Now, you only need to pay short-term capital gains tax on that $7,000.  You can offset up to $3,000 of crypto losses per year. If you’ve incurred more than that in a year, it can be carried over to future tax years.  Read More: How to Benefit From Tax-Loss Harvesting in Crypto  How are crypto gifts taxed?  “Gifts in virtual currency work a lot like a stock gift, bond gifts or gifts of any capital asset,” said ​​Mark Steber, Jackson Hewitt chief tax information officer.  Crypto gifts are not taxable upon the initial transfer from the owner to the new gift recipient.  In the U.S., gifts up to $16,000 per single recipient and $32,000 per married couple are tax free in the 2022 year.  That limit will be raised to $17,000 in 2023. If you are gifted or planning to gift crypto over the limit, it’s best to talk with a tax professional to understand the tax implications.  How are earnings from mining taxed?  The IRS is clear that taxes on mining earnings count as income tax, based on the fair market value of the crypto the day you received it.  Here’s an example:  You are running a bitcoin mining rig and you earned one bitcoin on June 12, 2022. The minute that bitcoin hits your wallet, the fair market value of BTC is at $25,000. You now have realized $25,000 of income that needs to be reported as such on your tax filings.  If you later sell, trade or spend any of that one bitcoin, you may have to also pay capital gains tax, if the price is higher than when you received it.

Ray III.  Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) is chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee's Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy.  His subcommittee “is seeking detailed information on the significant liquidity issues faced by FTX, the company’s abrupt decision to declare bankruptcy and the potential impact of these actions on customers who used your exchange,” Krishnamoorthi said.  He also pressed FTX to comply with an Aug. 30 document request from his subcommittee.  Krishnamoorthi's action follows the House Financial Services Committee setting a hearing on FTX's collapse for next month. On the Senate side of Capitol Hill, Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) sent their own letter to FTX seeking answers about the crypto exchange's finances.  Krishnamoorthi’s subcommittee set a Dec. 1 deadline for FTX to send that requested information.

42421427,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoDHB,1668796800,Crypto’s Very Human Fatal Flaw: Hero Worship,"As the crypto community grapples with what led to this, its biggest-ever crisis, a look at Shakespeare and his various king characters is useful.  Most of the bard’s monarchs are either megalomaniacal villains (Richard III, Claudius), dupes (Macbeth) or madmen (Lear). All of them are seduced by power, consumed by paranoia and fail to distinguish their self-interest from that of their subjects.  There are no allegations that Sam Bankman-Fried poisoned anyone or plotted against his next of kin. But there is now jaw-dropping evidence that, closeted in an island compound with a small cabal of insiders, the erstwhile CEO of FTX wielded power in an erratic, unchecked and highly destructive manner. All this while he cultivated, promoted and largely succeeded in embedding in popular consciousness the glossy image of a wise and benevolent leader.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  This wasn’t supposed to be the crypto way. Most FTX customers likely believed their investments in decentralized protocols supported systems that could free people, and their economic activity, from the need to trust a corruptible centralized authority. (Whether they understood the idea enough to discern which few tokens truly held such promise is a very different matter.)  Yet, there are fewer modern communities that have been so undermined by the investment of excessive trust in a leader figure. Its root cause is the age-old human habit of hero worship.  Crypto fanatics put this young, quirky leader on a pedestal, gave him the keys (literally) to the kingdom and allowed him to completely corrupt the authority they’d granted him. (Read the gob-smacking bankruptcy filing of SBF’s replacement CEO, John J. Ray III on the “unprecedented” accounting and business practices at FTX: a complete “failure of corporate controls,” an “absence of trustworthy financial information,” “compromised systems integrity,” and the “concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals.”)  And while SBF’s FTX takes the cake for crypto’s biggest con in dollar terms, it’s noteworthy how many other conmen crypto has produced: Mt. Gox’s Mark Karpeles, QuadrigaX’s Gerald Cotton, OneCoin’s Ruja Ignatova. The list goes on.  How could a community so obsessed with decentralized systems fall so frequently for the one thing it professes to resist? I’d say it’s a combination of interrelated, deeply human factors. Recognizing and understanding them is vital if the crypto community is to adopt a model of uber-governance that protects its members from being duped by such cons.  Crypto bros are human, after all  Hero worship is universal. It’s primal. It starts with alpha apes and tribal leaders and leads to our historical obsession with wartime leaders like Lincoln or Churchill, with celebrity CEOs like Warren Buffett or Jack Welch, or with sport coaches like Bill Belichick or Vince Lombardi. There is something deep-seated and innate in this most social of instincts. All groups are fearful of survival and look to leadership to set direction and protect them from such challenges.  So, if hero worship is innate and universal, anyone who advocates for a decentralized system to protect against its failings must also recognize that the same instinct lies within their own mind.  Look at the subculture of Bitcoin since its early days and at its all-defining origin story: that its code was created by a single, brilliant man who selflessly bequeathed it to the world and kept his own name and potential for fame out of it. There have been songs about Satoshi Nakamoto, and poems, and artwork and a hagiographic volume of his “collected writings” (IRC posts).  Read more: Who Is Satoshi Nakamoto?  There’s nothing wrong, per se, with any of this. As I said, it’s a natural state of mind. In fact, it’s hard to imagine the crypto community – itself so important to the formation of an ecosystem of money and value exchange – cohesively forming without these kinds of myths and objects of reverence.  What’s a problem is the denial that it exists, the idea that I’m not vulnerable to this kind of misplaced admiration because I’m a believer in math, not humans.  The vulnerability of invulnerability  This failure to see one’s own limitations is made doubly worse if you also have misplaced confidence in your safety because the system in which you believe you operate is supposed to be decentralized.  Security experts frequently observe that the systems most vulnerable to attack are those where actors have excessive faith in that system’s invulnerability. A false sense of security creates an ideal environment for an intruder.  The same goes for corruption. If there is outsized, unfounded trust in the incorruptibility of an ultimately flawed system, rogue actors can more easily abuse people.  How many of FTX’s customers mistakenly believed their investments were secure because the tokens they’d bought were associated with some decentralized blockchain, without realizing that those blockchain systems sat a few degrees of separation from the centralized, compromised entity acting as their intermediary?  Unregulated  The third piece of the puzzle is the lack of regulation, which opens a path to fixing this mess.  The absence of regulations curtailing the purse-string-controlling power of entities such as FTX tends to amplify the risks generated by these illusions of invulnerability.  Even if they intuitively understand how fractional reserve banking operates, people tend to think about their money in a bank account as being literally their dollars. The same goes for the amounts expressed in a third-party hosted crypto wallet. In both cases, the premise is false because customers’ funds and assets are commingled, not segregated; banks and centralized exchanges are debtors to their customers, not one-for-one custodians.  At least with a bank, the customer is protected by federal deposit insurance under regulatory requirements. A depositor with an under-regulated crypto exchange is really just an unsecured creditor with no recourse if the entity has used those collective assets to invest in outside projects whose value has evaporated. What makes them vulnerable to exploitation, then, is that they live under the illusion that their money is protected when it is not.  Watch: Bahamas Securities Regulator Says It Ordered FTX Crypto Transferred to Government Wallets  Does this mean the solution lies in tougher, globally universal regulations that compel centralized exchanges to ring-fence and protect their customers’ funds and for their controlling entities to be subject to strict audits? Maybe. But my point is not that governments are necessarily the answer but that some form of governance – be that a national regulator or an industry-wide self-regulatory system – is required to force the likes of FTX to protect their users.  Here we can take lessons from another king of history: England’s George III, the monarch who lost the American colonies and who then proceeded to go stark raving mad. The United States’ founders saw the human fallibility problem so clearly that, after some trial and error, they created a system to guard against it. The U.S. constitution, with its “checks and balances,” is one of the great decentralizing protocols of history.  The challenge then, for crypto, is not to figure out the best governance practices for each Layer 1 blockchain protocol, but to find the right framework of overarching governance for all the other human-led members of the surrounding ecosystem: the exchanges, the market-makers, the trading desks, the custodians, the wallet providers and so forth. Should it all be the government’s responsibility? Or is there a self-regulatory, industry-wide solution?  Whatever the fix, its protections should be founded on the famous maxim from Lord Acton upon which any functioning democracy is founded: “power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Michael J.

42421425,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoDE5,1668795049,Why Crypto Taxes Get Complicated (Especially for Institutions),"Accounting and tax compliance in crypto is much more complicated for institutions, such as funds, exchanges and prime brokerages, due to the volume of transactions that require record-keeping. Failing to file taxes properly can result in substantial fines and, in some cases, audits.  These high financial stakes combined with the difficulty of tracking so much complex transaction data has kept many institutions out of crypto to date. Understanding tax requirements and implementing programmatic record-keeping can be a good starting point for institutions to demystify crypto tax laws and reap the rewards of participating in this fast-growing ecosystem.  Shawn Douglass is co-founder and CEO of Amberdata. This article is part of Tax Week.  What are taxable events in crypto?  With the inception of crypto marked by the publication of the bitcoin white paper in October 2008, the industry is only 14 years old. However, the historically slow pace of regulatory change is finally catching up to where the ecosystem is today, with governments like the United States, Singapore, Australia and others issuing new frameworks and guidelines for how cryptocurrencies will be taxed in their jurisdictions.  In the U.S., the Internal Revenue Services (IRS) treats cryptocurrency as property, and so cryptocurrency transactions are subject to the same short-term and long-term capital gains taxes. A gain can be realized by selling cryptocurrency, trading or by purchasing an item like a car with cryptocurrency that has appreciated in value since the time it was originally purchased.  By the same token, losses from cryptocurrency investments can be written off as deductions. Cryptocurrency is taxed as regular income if it's received as payment for providing a service or earned from mining or staking. Interest earned from lending is also treated as income.  Perhaps most surprising of all, in the U.S. any movement of tokens or digital assets between wallets, centralized exchanges or individuals (without any sale or purchase taking place) is regarded as a taxable event as well.  This concept is completely foreign to most traditional financial institutions, as they are not used to paying fees if they send money between bank accounts. When even the smallest details become complex to track, one starts to weigh the value proposition of engaging in the first place. Luckily, with access to the right tools and data, this complexity can be managed.  Why crypto taxes get complicated  These categories for how cryptocurrencies are taxed in the U.S. may sound relatively simple: pay taxes on capital gains and deduct losses while counting other forms of crypto earned as regular income. But the challenge isn't knowing how cryptocurrency transactions are taxed – it's keeping track of all transactions.  In particular, financial institutions, such as exchanges, hedge funds, prime brokerages and trading desks could have millions of transactions to record, report and pay taxes on.  Additionally, stakes are high for entities failing to meet their tax and accounting requirements. Failing an audit due to poor accounting practices could result in the organization having to pay back taxes and face additional large fines.  The importance of granular tax compliance data  The high stakes combined with the challenges of accounting for millions of transactions necessitates the implementation of programmatic software for accessing and tracking granular data. Financial institutions depend on comprehensive APIs that can be integrated into their platforms to capture every transaction nuance so that balance sheets, income statements, cash flow statements and other essential accounting documentation can be quickly and easily generated.  In addition to wallet balances, deposits and net worth, institutional investors are also required to account for every transaction for every wallet under management.  Participating in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols can make tax accounting even more complex. For example, if an institution is providing liquidity on a decentralized exchange (DEX), it also needs current and historical liquidity provisioning positions (in other words an exchange's assets and liabilities), current and historical percentage of the total pool owned, fees earned, claimed and unclaimed, as well as the percentage fee provided by the pool.  Institutions must also track their profits and losses while participating in DeFi. This includes marking any ""impermanent losses,"" a crypto industry term for slippage, they incur as a liquidity provider on lending platforms like Aave and Compound. This is in addition to tracking important information like a platform's net annual percentage yield (APY), current loan-to-value ratio (LTV) and total value locked (TVL), which can often change in a blink of an eye in the fast-moving world of DeFi.  This comprehensive documentation is essential for financial institutions to meet all tax obligations and file correctly. Beyond tax law compliance, effective accounting also provides institutions with the benefit of better understanding their organization's tax exposure so that actions can be taken to reduce liability.  Regulatory clarity and institutional involvement  Any institutional player considering getting involved in the digital asset space is well aware of the need for tax law compliance (and the consequences for failing to comply), and many would cite regulatory risk as the biggest roadblock for participating in the digital asset economy. The good news is that regulatory clarity has improved dramatically over the past couple years.  See also: You May Owe Crypto Taxes on These Surprising Things in 2022  Just last month, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) published a new tax reporting framework, the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF), to offer governments clarity on how transactions conducted across borders should be treated by tax authorities.

42414856,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBTXLO,1668794529,"NFT Marketplace X2Y2 Will Enforce Creator Royalties, After Pushback","Popular non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace X2Y2 has flipped its decision to make creator royalties optional. The original move inspired several other marketplaces to follow suit.  X2Y2 said Friday on Twitter that it will now enforce creator royalties on all of the collections sold on its platform after being one of the first to drop its royalty requirements. Its model, called “Flexible Royalties,” sparked pushback from some NFT creators and marketplaces about ensuring that NFT creators are compensated fairly for their works.  X2Y2 referenced leading NFT marketplace OpenSea’s on-chain royalty enforcing tool, which will blacklist collections from being resold on marketplaces that don’t enforce royalties. It said that most new collections have opted for this model.  “We used to believe the best way to handle royalties is to give both parties, creators and traders, the right to choose,” the marketplace wrote on Twitter. “Putting belief aside, if there was anything self-evident in crypto, it's the ‘code.”  In August, X2Y2 said it would make royalties optional, allowing buyers to elect how much they contribute to creators. In October, NFT marketplaces Magic Eden and LooksRare followed in its footsteps, leading to discussions about a royalty-optional future.  According to a tweet from Twitter user Punk9059, about 30% of NFT trades since August have been royalty-free.  Last week, OpenSea pushed back against optional royalties, sticking to its decision to enforce creator royalties across its platform.  “Proud to stand with you – and the many brilliant creators in our community – on this critical measure,” said OpenSea in response to X2Y2’s announcement on Twitter.",POSITIVE,없음,OTHER,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2022/11/18/nft-marketplace-x2y2-will-enforce-creator-royalties-after-pushback,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/36012690419e4a597be4937cb19f15ec0b387786-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

On TWT’s week-on-week chart, the token has amassed over 90% gains. This comes as FTX’s debacle unfolds and traders grow wary of centralized exchanges. Furthermore, Binance’s CEO endorsed Trust Wallet in a recent tweet, resulting in more interest in the token. While several Redditors mentioned that Binance owning Trust Wallet was a turn-off, it didn’t stop the token from soaring. TWT also posted substantial gains on the day, with an intraday increase of 4.6%. It reached a local high of $2.34 before settling at its current price of $2.22 press time. Trust Wallet Token’s huge 90% gains undermine the overall market trend that still struggles to recover from the FTX’s collapse. Another catalyst is the recent browser extension launch and Binance and Coinbase integration news. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: 130k BTC Just Flowed Into Binance TWT Launches Browser Extension, Integrates with Top Exchanges The self-custody Trust Wallet is gaining popularity in the wake of FTX’s demise and the bank run that has affected crypto exchanges generally. Recently the wallet unveiled its eagerly awaited browser extension for PC. It also teamed up with Coinbase Pay and Binance Pay, allowing their users to send money straight to a Trust Wallet account immediately. The browser add-on was introduced on November 14 and is now accessible in Opera and Google Chrome. The extension enables users to save, transmit, and receive cryptocurrency across all Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains and Solana. Users may also enjoy a flawless DApp experience without adding networks manually, thanks to a network auto-detect capability. The extension also supports hardware wallets, multiple wallets, NFT, fiat on-ramp providers, and non-EVM blockchain connectors. Two days after, Binance launched Binance Pay’s Trust Wallet integration. This integration establishes Trust Wallet as one of the platform’s official withdrawal options. Thus users no longer have to scan QR codes to send money to their Trust Wallet accounts. Also, sending to the wallet from Binance won’t cost anything extra besides the blockchain gas fee. The same integration will work for Coinbase Pay. According to Coinbase’s product manager, the integration helps create a “bridge to web3” for customers through seamless self-custody wallet funding. TWT Soard 90% As Whales Start Accumulating TWT has enjoyed massive attention following the FTX implosion. But that’s not the only area gaining ground, as it has seen a high capital inflow. As per CoinMarketCap data, the cryptocurrency had a market value of $950.47 million after gaining over $460.27 million in a week. It even reached a local high of $1.11 billion mid-week. Related Reading: Chiliz Continues To Trend Higher Amidst World Cup Fever; Is $0.4 Possible? Furthermore, the token is gaining much attention from whales. Since TWT is still relatively cheap, whale accumulation has increased in the past few days. According to Santiment, TWT’s supply rate owned by addresses with a balance of 1,000-10 million TWT increased during its latest run. Although the token’s 24-hour trading volume is down 27%, there’s a chance that it might increase before the trading day ends.

On Thursday, Silvergate CEO Alan Lane tried to assuage investors that market volatility precipitated by FTX’s collapse would not affect the crypto banker’s business.  “Suffice it to say, whether deposits are up or down, we have the liquidity and the capital ratios to support the volatility,” said Lane at the Oppenheimer Blockchain & Digital Assets Summit.  But his message seemed to fall flat as the company’s stock price fell almost 10% on Friday. More broadly, shares of Silvergate Capital have nosedived 85% since last year’s crypto bull run.  Hours after Lane’s remarks, crypto prime brokerage FalconX announced it would not be using Silvergate SEN Leverage, which enables institutional investors to trade any asset on-platform with leverage collateralized by bitcoin or U.S. dollars, “out of an abundance of caution.” It will also not be using the crypto banker to make wire transfers.  Last Friday, Silvergate announced that it has no outstanding loans or investments to FTX and clarified that FTX is not a custodian for any of its bitcoin-collateralized SEN Leverage loans. FTX does have at least $1 billion in deposits with Silvergate, but the bank says that represents less than 10% of its total deposits from all digital asset customers.  Both institutional and retail investors have been on edge since FTX’s collapse as they attempt to anticipate the effects of a third market-disrupting contagion on the crypto market and the crypto industry at large. The first two contagions were precipitated by the Terra collapse in May and Three Arrow Capital’s implosion in June, respectively.  Marc Cohodes, an early critic of FTX, says FTX’s deposits with Silvergate are still a sizable percentage of the banker’s overall deposit base. On Tuesday, Cohodes told Hedgeye that he’s shorting Silvergate, noting the size of FTX’s deposits with the bank is a huge red flag.

Layer 2 scaling chains Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism are diminishing the need for the L1 ""ETH Killers"" and it's showing in user metrics. Since the Merge, Ethereum now has a net negative ETH issuance when factoring in the ETH burned from transactions. It has now been two full months since Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) successfully merged from proof of work to proof of stake. Despite that event being one of the more important stories in the history of crypto, it has already been completely overshadowed by the collapse of FTX (FTT-USD). And rightfully so. The FTX story is one that transcends crypto and is yet another egregious black eye on the blockchain space as an investable opportunity. But I want to make my thoughts on FTX very clear; the fall of FTX is not a failure of crypto or of financial regulations. In my view, it is a failure of risk management, transparency, and the movement toward the centralization of blockchain-based assets. It's a shame that it happened and I feel terrible for the people who lost money, but the good networks in this space just kept making new blocks even when other coins collapsed and companies went bust. A big loser from the Alameda/FTX fallout appears to be Solana ( SOL-USD ). Solana is one of the famed ""ETH killers"" from the bull run of 2021 and the future of that chain now looks highly uncertain. The list of potential ETH killers also included Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ) and Cardano ( ADA-USD ). Despite the amount of Layer 1 blockchains that figure to compete with Ethereum, some of the best growth in smart contracts over the last several months has actually been in the Layer 2 Ethereum chains. Let's dig in. Polygon The most valuable Ethereum scaler is Polygon ( MATIC-USD ). It has a $7.7 billion circulating market cap and an $8.8 billion fully diluted cap. 87% of the max 10 billion token supply is currently in circulation. Daily transactions on Polygon, while lower than the boom experienced in the summer of 2021, have been solidly in the 2-3 million range for several months: Polygon Daily Transactions (Polyscan) Transactions are steady, but it's the users of Polygon that continue to grow: ETH v MATIC DAUs (Token Terminal) The daily active user growth on Polygon has been so strong that it is now nearly at par with Ethereum's daily active users over the last several months. Polygon has averaged 439k daily active users in the first half of Q4-22; an 18% year over year increase. Ethereum has 446k in the first half of Q4-22; a decline of 21% year over year. Ethereum's base layer usage remains relatively constant even as scaling chains continue to see growth in key usage metrics. The beauty of this relationship is the L2 chains allow for scalability but they all still need ETH at the base layer. This means growth in chains like Polygon, Optimism (OP-USD), and Arbitrum (ARB-USD) add value to Ethereum. Optimism & Arbitrum While the daily actives for other Ethereum scaling chains may not be quite as large as what we're seeing on Polygon, there's no doubt that Optimism and Arbitrum have become far more popular among crypto users in the last several months. Avalanche, Optimism, Arbitrum DAUs (Token Terminal) Arbitrum has now flipped the daily active users on Layer 1 chain Avalanche and Optimism isn't too far behind. Not only is Avalanche not really competing with Ethereum as a base layer chain, but Avalanche is behind nearly 3 distinctly different layer 2 Ethereum chains as well - Polygon's DAUs aren't pictured in the chart above because the figure is so much higher that it would distort the chart. Both scaling chains are seeing significant growth in daily transactions: Daily Transactions (Etherscan explorers) This chart looks a lot like the one for daily active users. Only here we see Optimism has already joined Arbitrum in flipping daily transactions on Avalanche. Arbitrum was doing between 50-100k daily transactions over the summer. It has been averaging just under 400k daily transactions so far in the month of November. Not too far off, Optimism is averaging about 350k daily transactions in November. Avalanche has fallen below 200k month to date and Cardano has averaged under 80k so far. As these second layer Ethereum chains continue to onboard new users, the scaling chains add value to Ethereum; which continues to be the base layer security chain that helps shape how the Web3 internet might look in the future. We're now officially at the point where not one but three Ethereum scaling chains have better on-chain usage trends than Solana, Avalanche, and Cardano in some key areas. Ethereum Killers? Not really For all the speculation last year that Ethereum would have enormous competition from other Layer 1 blockchains with faster block times and more transactions per second, we simply haven't seen anything offered by other crypto builders manifest into a true heir to the throne. And in reality, Solana (SOL-USD) , the one L1 that I thought had the best chance against Ethereum might be on borrowed time. TVL Share 12/31/21 11/17/22 Ethereum 57.3% 58.0% Binance 7.2% 12.0% Tron 3.2% 10.1% Polygon 3.1% 2.6% Avalanche 6.2% 2.1% Arbitrum 1.1% 2.2% Optimism 0.2% 1.3% Cronos 1.0% 1.4% Fantom 2.2% 1.0% Solana 3.9% 0.7% Others 14.6% 8.6% Source: DeFi Llama Even with the proliferation of other options, Ethereum is still the king of DeFi. While it's true Binance ( BNB-USD ) and Tron ( TRX-USD ) have seen faster growth than Ethereum, Ethereum is coming from a much larger starting spot. Furthermore, when we combine TVLs of ETH and the L2 chains on Ethereum, we see Ethereum as a network isn't losing share at all: TVL Share 12/31/21 11/17/22 Ethereum 57.3% 58.0% Polygon 3.1% 2.6% Arbitrum 1.1% 2.2% Optimism 0.2% 1.3% Combined 61.7% 64.1% Source: DeFi Llama It's Avalanche, Solana, and the rest of the L1 chains that are losing ground in DeFi to Ethereum and Binance. From a protocol diversification perspective, Ethereum is on far more stable footing than Binance or Tron: TVL Share Protocols Protocol Dominance Ethereum 601 26.7% Binance 500 51.1% Tron 10 65.7% Polygon 333 25.2% Arbitrum 139 42.7% Optimism 86 24.1% Source: DeFi Llama Protocol dominance is the amount of a chain's TVL that is attributable to one application. The larger the number the more reliant the chain is on the success of one protocol for TVL. The table above shows Binance and Tron have generally poor TVL diversification. Tron's is particularly bad because of the high level of dominance on one application and just 10 protocols total. Ethereum's Supply/Demand Mechanics As I noted in my Ethereum article from last month , Ethereum has turned into a deflationary asset. However, at the time of that article there were roughly 7,000 new ETH coins issued since the Merge. That figure has now turned convincingly as significantly more ETH has been burned than issued over the last 10 days: ultrasound.money ETH has gone from +7k issuance since the Merge a month ago to net negative supply since the Merge. This is the kind of supply/demand dynamic that can really put a floor under the price of ETH even in an extended crypto winter if demand for the network continues to grow as we're seeing on the scaling chains. Risks Sentiment in crypto is about as bad as I can recall seeing it. That could be an indication that we've finally capitulated or it could be an indication that the thesis really is dead this time. I don't think it's the latter. One could argue we're actually closer to the end than the middle of crypto winter. What remains to be seen is what the regulatory headwinds could be for both crypto broadly and Ethereum specifically. There can be almost no doubt FTX will be seen as an opportunity for those who would like to see more oversight of the industry from regulatory bodies in the United States. It's entirely possible the SEC may view ETH as a security. I don't personally share that view but my opinion is irrelevant to Gary Gensler. Summary The growth in the Ethereum scalers coupled with the apparent failings of several notorious ""Ethereum Killers"" tells me that Ethereum is still the king of the smart contract space. Rather than make even small bets on L1 chains that are probably doomed to fail, it might be wiser to wager on the continued development of Ethereum's scaling chains and the value those chains add to Ethereum. I think MATIC is going to be a big winner. Optimism could be as well but that chain has tough tokenomics and Arbitrum doesn't have a token at all. The best way to play growth in the Ethereum ecosystem is still just by buying and holding ETH.",POSITIVE,ETH | MATIC | ARB | BNB,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MATIC | ARB | BNB,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4559074-ethereum-still-best-bet-in-smart-contracts?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4435954.jpeg
42414859,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBTXQh,1668790881,"Sorare, Under Pressure From France’s Gambling Regulator, Will Expand Free Access","Non-fungible token fantasy gaming platform Sorare has agreed to amend the rules for its NFT soccer trading game under pressure from the French National Gambling Authority (ANJ), the regulator said in a statement on Friday.  The ANJ called for changes to French law to better account for Web3 gaming, after political criticism the current arrangements did little to protect children and compulsive gamblers.  As part of the deal, Sorare has said it will expand free access to the game. If it doesn’t do so by the end of March, the authority threatened to use its legal powers, which in theory allow it to impose fines of up to 5% of a company’s turnover.  “The chosen solution constitutes a needed regulatory response to the offer made by Sorare,” the ANJ said in a statement, adding that it needed to “effectively protect the public but also support innovation” in examining similar developments in future.  Sorare, a kind of fantasy sports card game involving well known stars including Cristiano Ronaldo, Kylian Mbappé and Lionel Messi, awards prizes that can be exchanged for money. Its apparent similarity to regulated activities has drawn complaints.  In an August question to the government, French Senator Jerome Durain said the game “seems to meet all the criteria of gambling under the internal security code."" Durain called for better controls to stop money laundering, or playing by children or gambling addicts – concerns which the ANJ seems to share.  While the ANJ has accepted Sorare’s deal as a transitional measure, the regulator worries the law isn’t up to scratch, and called for a “rapid evolution” of legislation to cater for Web3.  A spokesperson for Sorare told CoinDesk it would implement the temporary changes early in 2023, and longer term agreed with the need for new regulations.  “Sorare shares this urgent need and is committed to working with all stakeholders, including the ANJ, to define this new [regulatory] framework,” the spokesperson said. “Through its constructive exchanges with the ANJ, Sorare once again reaffirms its desire to build the next global entertainment giant.”  Over the summer, Sorare CEO Nicolas Julia said it was “not surprising” that a growing technology would raise new questions, and that he saw it as a “sign that shows we are pushing boundaries.”  Read more: Sorare 101: How to Get Started With Sorare NFTs",NEUTRAL,없음,REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/18/sorare-under-pressure-from-frances-gambling-regulator-will-expand-free-access,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/43907d466f14bfce1bd5f376174ee66863486167-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
4436845,https://newsbtc.com/?p=509223,1668790819,Is Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao To Blame For FTX Collapse?,"In the space of one week, FTX had gone from being the second-largest crypto exchange by trading volume to being bankrupt. This swift move from being ‘okay’ to being in ‘hot water’ has shown just how uncertain things can be in the crypto market. Since it happened, there has been some finger-pointing as participants in the space look for someone to blame, and some of those fingers have been pointed at Changpeng Zhao. Is CZ The Cause? The bank run on the FTX crypto exchange had actually started when Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao made it public that the exchange was planning to sell its FTT holdings. What would follow was a rollercoaster couple of days that would end in a bankruptcy filing on the part of FTX. But the question remains, did CZ really cause this? At first glance, it would look as if CZ had actually intended to trigger a bank run on FTX, especially given their public Twitter beef. However, with recent developments, the only thing that could be remotely true is that CZ had accelerated an inevitable collapse. With an around $9 billion hole, there were bound to be issues with the company sooner or later. Add in the fact that there were already red flags such as Sam Bankman-Fried trying to raise more funds for the exchange and Alameda hemorrhaging money, the die was already cast. As for CZ, the decision to sell FTT tokens was always a double-edged sword. Yes, the CEO could have quietly sold the tokens but it would have eventually been made public and Binance would be accused of dumping on retail secretly. The second option, which was to openly sell the tokens, was just the last nail in the coffin for an already dying FTX. It was a lose-lose situation. FTX Not Doing Any Favors The newly appointed CEO of FTX, John Ray III has already gone to work and the findings have been nothing short of catastrophic. Ray, who had helped energy trader Enron navigate bankruptcy in the early 2000s would go on to say that he had never seen anything like FTX in his career. The level of incompetency at the crypto exchange apparently shocked the Wall Street lawyer so much that he tagged it ‘unprecendented.’ As more information about FTX emerges, it is not hard to see why Ray would say that. From house-buying sprees for FTX employees to executives taking personal loans worth billions of dollars from Alameda Research, how FTX was run is nothing short of a fraudulent company. Currently, there are reportedly more than 1 million creditors who have been unable to get their funds from FTX. The billions of dollars are nowhere to be found as the exchange enters into full bankruptcy mode. It has also drastically reduced trust in the crypto market. Self-custody is now more popular than ever as investors scramble to put their coins in cold storage.

42421432,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoDKH,1668790571,The Pitfalls of Being Paid in Crypto,"Increasingly, companies are seeking to compensate their employees and other service providers with crypto and other digital assets.  This practice raises similar issues to ones that arise when compensating employees or paying service providers with equity. These types of compensatory digital assets grants require thoughtful and strategic planning.  Amy Sheridan and Natalie Lederman are both partners at law firm Sullivan & Worcester LLP. This article is part of CoinDesk’s Tax Week.  Yes, you really do need to consider US taxes  Although many crypto companies set up operations outside the states – and may undertake great efforts to avoid having any U.S. footprint – U.S. tax rules have a very broad reach for individuals.  If compensatory digital asset grants are made to U.S. citizens, green card holders or residents, (or to anyone doing any work in the U.S. at the time of the grant, or vesting and exercise periods), U.S. tax rules will apply. In other words, receivers will likely have to pay U.S. taxes.  Failing to consider U.S. tax rules can have terrible consequences for employees. If violated, a particularly nasty U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) code – specifically, Section 409A - imposes a 20% excise tax (plus a premium interest penalty). That provision also requires income inclusion at vesting, even if the digital asset grant is not liquid (like many locked-up tokens) or has yet to be transferred.  Read more: What's the Matter With Delaware? How Joe Biden's Home State Became a Global Tax Avoidance Hub / Opinion  In addition to creating a liquidity problem for the (often unsuspecting) employee, it also can result in a foreign tax credit mismatch, making a credit essentially unavailable and resulting in an even higher tax rate on income that is already taxed at the highest marginal tax rate in the U.S.  Between the high marginal rate, the excise tax and potential for foreign tax credit mismatch, it is not difficult to imagine scenarios where crypto or digital asset grants are taxed at an 80% or higher effective rate due to poor planning.  There are few ‘go-to’ solutions  It’s likely fair to say that U.S. tax rules are generally not designed with crypto or digital asset grants in mind. While this makes these grants more complex to design (compared to traditional stock or partnership interests), it also creates opportunities for creativity.  In general, U.S. tax rules treat token or crypto grants as transfers of , or promises to transfer, property. Such arrangements tend to be designed as either options to receive the digital asset as an outright grant of that asset and therefore subject to forfeiture conditions, or as promises to grant the asset once certain vesting conditions are satisfied.  Each of these structures, however, have advantages and disadvantages. Among those concerns is the flexibility employers have around timing a compensatory transfer. This impacts the potential for favorable capital gains tax rates on an eventual sale of the asset, liquidity and valuation risks as well as the overall complexity of the arrangement – all of which need to be carefully managed.  Tax and liquidity misalignments  U.S. tax rules generally require income inclusion (and reporting) when the subject digital assets are transferred to employees and, under certain circumstances, at vesting.  The fair market value of a digital asset is taxable, making it subject to ordinary income tax at that time. Under certain circumstances, employment taxes (i.e. Social Security and Medicare taxes) may be due at vesting, which may or may not be at the time of transfer. Further, the date of transfer or vesting may or may not occur at the same time the digital asset is liquid.  These same liquidity issues arise in traditional equity transfers to employees and are typically handled through “net” or “cashless” mechanisms, whereby the amount of equity the employee ultimately receives is reduced to reflect tax amounts that are paid on the employee’s behalf.  Read more: Crypto Capital Gains and Tax Rates 2022  Employers will often align the tax event with the liquidity event to limit confusion here. This sometimes also includes using another arrangement to provide cash to the employee or service provider, such as a loan or additional cash bonuses.  In the digital asset context, however, these solutions are not always available or desirable.  First, the value of digital assets can be highly volatile, even over short periods of time. Accordingly, the tax due with respect to the subject digital asset may far exceed the employee or service provider’s regular compensation levels or what the company can realistically provide to the employee to manage liquidity problems.  Second, if the subject digital asset is viewed under applicable federal securities laws as a security, then the employee may required to hold the digital asset for up to one year following the tenets of Rule 144 of the United States Securities Act of 1933.  In light of the tax, securities law and other ambiguities that continue to exist in the context of compensating employees and other service providers with crypto and other digital assets, it is critical to exercise care and caution, and to seek expert counsel to avoid some of the most common complications and pitfalls.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,"Amy Sheridan, Natalie Lederman",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/11/18/crypto-employee-compensation-pitfalls,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ef97e1891f4f17c0eb886cd0c8d72368b737d7cb-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421422,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoDC1,1668790493,"If You Lost Money on FTX, You May See Some Tax Relief","The Bernie Madoff Ponzi scheme uncovered in late 2008 resulted in new Internal Revenue Service (IRS) guidance allowing investors to recover substantial losses from the $65 billion financial fraud. Will the 2022 crypto implosions likewise prompt another round of guidance tailored for the crypto market? Time will tell.  The recent collapse of global crypto exchange FTX is likely to be one of the most impactful events in the digital asset industry’s 13-year history. In a spectacular event kick-started by a CoinDesk article and a couple of tweets, billions of dollars of wealth spontaneously combusted, 130+ entities declared bankruptcy and thousands of users are without access to their funds.  Victoria J. Haneman is Frank J. Kellegher professor of trusts and estates at Creighton University School of Law. This article is part of CoinDesk’s Tax Week.  For FTX users, the situation is bleak. It is unlikely that funds deposited at FTX will be recovered. What is the FTX investor to do – from a tax perspective – now that their cryptocurrency investment is (at best) in a death spiral or (at worst) lost forever?  It seems that FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, the charismatic marketplace wunderkind referred to as SBF, extended $10 billion of loans funded by FTX customers to prop up his trading firm Alameda Research.  When a surge of FTX customers attempted to withdraw their money from the cryptocurrency exchange, the result was an epic liquidity crisis that left FTX with an $8 billion shortfall. The exchange was supposed to keep 1:1 reserves to customer deposits, but was in fact operating on fractional reserves (a bit like a bank).  Read more: Crypto Can De-Escalate the Tax War | Opinion  What looks very much like the (mis?)appropriation of client funds from FTX to Alameda was never disclosed to customers. The transfers arguably violated FTX terms of service, and perhaps also U.S. federal laws. All of this has serious implications for users’ tax bills.  The situation will likely be complicated by ongoing criminal investigations and bankruptcy processes, as well as whether users were able to move their funds off the exchange.  Money on the exchange  For those who abandoned ship early and successfully cashed out and/or withdrew funds, any resulting capital loss may be used to offset their capital gains (plus $3,000 of ordinary income). Any excess capital loss is not wasted. The investor can continue to offset capital gains taxes accrued from trading or investment activities and take a deduction of $3,000 every year until the loss is exhausted, according to tax precedent.  What about the investors who find themselves stuck? Thousands upon thousands on the FTX exchange are unable to trade or withdraw funds. These investors are in a more complicated tax position, with an investment that is essentially frozen. They are unable to realize a loss for tax purposes because no sale or exchange can happen.  But doesn’t the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) rulebook allow a deduction for worthless securities that are considered “capital assets?” Yes. And yes, crypto is usually characterized as a capital asset.  Unfortunately, the deduction for worthless securities requires that a security be worthless. The IRS insists that crypto is property, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not yet formally declared that cryptocurrencies as an asset class are securities.  It is also unclear whether crypto on the FTX exchange is completely worthless, or simply inaccessible because of illiquidity (with possible partial recovery down the road).  Read more: Crypto Capital Gains and Tax Rates 2022  What about a personal casualty loss deduction? Personal casualty losses have been suspended until the end of 2025, according to 2018’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, unless the loss is related to a federally declared disaster. So, unless an FTX investor has lost access to their wallet forever because of a sudden or unexpected event occurring because of a declared disaster, or the FTX bankruptcy carries through to 2026 without resolution, a personal casualty loss is unlikely to be available.  Perhaps it is an option for the FTX investor to claim an “abandonment loss” under U.S. Treasury Reg. §1.165-2. If the investment has lost all value (not because of a sale or exchange), and the taxpayer initially had the intent to make a profit, there is now clear intent to abandon the investment. This means “affirmative actions” have been taken to demonstrate abandonment – a possible path to a write off. However, the burden is on the taxpayer to establish that all of these requirements have been met.  Ponzi schemes and tax relief  Further, if Sam Bankman-Fried’s trading empire is found to have operated as a Ponzi scheme, that characterization may end up providing substantial tax relief to investors. Ponzi schemes generally implode when the momentum of new investments is disrupted, for whatever reason, with the resulting illiquidity crisis causing a collapse.  Some have already compared FTX’s collapse to the Ponzi started and managed by Bernie Madoff (the largest in history with $65 billion), while others believe that FTX started out as a legitimate crypto investment and backslid into a Ponzi when Alameda began losing money.  Regardless, if the FTX collapse falls within the definition of a Ponzi, investors may deduct their losses as an “investment theft loss” instead of a capital loss. And while capital losses are subject to loss limitation rules ($3,000 per year against ordinary income), investment theft losses are deductible immediately.  Relief under the Ponzi scheme “safe harbor” set forth in Rev. Proc. 2009-20 is not without precedent in the digital asset industry. Investors in BitConnect, a $2.4 billion global Ponzi scheme, may enjoy the benefits of this safe harbor following the indictment of its founder in February 2022.  Under safe harbor rules, an investor may take a deduction equal to 95% of the amount invested in the cryptocurrency if the investor is not seeking or does not intend to seek recovery from a third party.  The loss is deductible in the year of discovery or the year the Ponzi scheme’s orchestrator is (1) charged by indictment for fraud, embezzlement or a similar crime; (2) the subject of a state or criminal complaint and either admits guilt or has assets frozen by court-order; or (3) the subject of the fraudulent arrangement faces no charges, indictment or complaint because of his death.  See also: Is Crypto a Ponzi? Define 'Ponzi' | Opinion  It remains to be seen if charges will be filed against SBF. Unfortunately, it may be difficult to establish criminal intent as opposed to withering incompetence on the part of 30-year-old former quant. Still, the SEC and the Justice Department (DoJ) are both reportedly investigating the collapse of FTX. Though some argue that there will be jurisdictional challenges because FTX is headquartered in the Bahamas (despite declaring bankruptcy in the U.S.).  For now, considering what we know today, individual investors with money trapped in the FTX exchange are unlikely to be able to take a deduction on their 2022 tax filings.

42421420,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoD8v,1668790202,How Bad Tax Policy Drives DAOs Out of the US,"It has been over a year since Wyoming passed the first U.S. law recognizing decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) as legal partnerships. But demand for this registration remains muted.  The reality is that most DAOs will likely continue incorporating overseas (if they incorporate at all). This is not because of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) regulation, but because of the very same tax considerations venture capital and hedge fund managers have been grappling with for decades.  Mark Lurie is the CEO of Shipyard Software Inc, a decentralized exchange retail crypto traders. This article is part of CoinDesk’s Tax Week.  Around the world, DAOs are increasingly incorporating as legitimate businesses to protect their members from liability. In a first-of-its-kind lawsuit filed earlier this year, a group of plaintiffs charged members of bZx DAO with negligence in protecting the funds deposited in their protocol, which exposed it to a hack costing users $55 million.  A few months later, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) sued members of Ooki DAO for offering margin-traded financial products without registering as an official merchant. Events like these doubtlessly drive more DAOs to consider incorporation or some other type of entity formation in an effort to limit members’ personal liability.  These messy litigations fuel the prevailing understanding that DAOs prefer to incorporate overseas to avoid regulatory headaches in the U.S. This is a partial factor. However, ultimately, the main deterrent for DAOs incorporation in the U.S. actually comes down to the way the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) classifies and taxes business entities.  US DAO incorporation triggers extreme tax obligations  Within the U.S., the most common types of business entities are LLCs and corporations, or more specifically C-corporations. C-corps are legally distinct from their owners and responsible for paying their own taxes, except when they issue dividends, which often triggers a tax obligation to shareholders.  In contrast, LLCs are considered “pass-through entities,” which means that revenue passes through the business to the owners, who then report it on their personal tax returns as individual income. Many entrepreneurs choose to form an LLC because income is only taxed once at the individual level, rather than “double taxed” at the company level and on dividends.  Yet, there is one major drawback to opting for an LLC – unlike with corporations, all LLC owners must pay taxes on their share of LLC income. Even if the LLC does not distribute profits, the income tax allocations are automatic.  Read more: What's the Matter With Delaware? How Joe Biden's Home State Became a Global Tax Avoidance Hub / Opinion  For instance, if an LLC DAO with five owners holding equal shares makes $40 million in 2022, all five owners would be individually responsible for reporting taxes on $8 million in income, regardless of profits handed out.  U.S. citizens must pay these taxes even if they live outside of the country since they must pay taxes on income no matter where they live in the world – a policy unique to the US. Meanwhile, non-U.S. citizens might be able to avoid paying taxes on this income, but would likely still need to file an IRS tax return to report it.  Even without coughing up funds, the pain and expense of filing a U.S. tax return would likely be a dealbreaker for many non-U.S. citizens, particularly for those with complex financial holdings and income streams. And DAOs, like crypto generally, are a global phenomenon with contributors from all over the world.  If DAO members decide not to comply, the U.S. could soon sanction them under anti-corruption and fraud monitoring regulations, leaving them unable to use any U.S.-linked banks or financial institutions. This step is usually reserved for criminal activity, but it could be used in response to failed tax compliance, especially if the DAO has sizable revenues.  Traditional workarounds are unfeasible for DAOs  Hedge funds have navigated this issue for decades, often relying on what’s called a master-feeder fund. Those who must file U.S. tax returns regardless place their investment in a domestic fund, while those who are U.S. tax-exempt put their money in a foreign fund, perhaps in the Cayman or British Virgin Islands.  These feeder funds then deposit the investors’ capital into the hedge fund’s offshore master account, which then makes investments. Earnings would later be distributed to U.S. investors through the domestic feeder fund and to non-U.S. investors through the foreign feeder fund, thus skirting U.S. taxes.  Given these roadblocks, you can begin to see how a DAO that chooses to become a U.S. LLC will create a Kafkaesque maze of tax issues and potential financial liabilities for its members. And this byzantine structure would be further complicated if the DAO issues a governance token, triggering tax reporting obligations for hundreds, even thousands, of token holders.  Read more: Use Your Crypto Losses to Turn the Tables Against the IRS  As a result, most DAOs that are seriously considering U.S. business entity formation are either unaware of their looming tax obligations or 100% confident they’ll never have a non-U.S. citizen member. The former will soon awaken from their reverie; the latter will always have a limited talent pool.  This likely explains why only a handful of DAOs have formed entities in Wyoming in the year since the law’s passage, while foreign jurisdictions with similar DAO-friendly laws, such as the Marshall Islands, have seen DAOs arriving in droves.  This is why legal guidance on how to incorporate DAOs as LLCs in the U.S. largely miss the point. Andreessen Horowitz, for instance, recently published a DAO business entity flowchart, guiding concerned members through the decision-making process to ultimately form a limited liability company (LLC), a foreign foundation, a limited cooperative association (LCA) or remain entityless.  But as long as U.S. tax regulations make it infeasible or too expensive for DAOs to execute this in practice, any U.S.-based approach will likely fail to gain traction.  US tax laws are unambiguous and unforgiving  Unlike securities and financial regulation, U.S. tax policy is mostly black and white when it comes to crypto. Applying existing laws to this new form of currency is relatively straightforward, as it’s more about individuals, assets and income than innovative financial instruments and complex technologies.  What’s more, it’s an open secret that the IRS has perhaps the most insightful and sophisticated crypto team of any government agency.  The number of DAO members that still believe decentralization provides complete practical protections against regulation and legal liability is shrinking fast. In particular, the DeFi community is increasingly aware that the longer they operate without registering their DAO as a business entity, the more they risk being held legally and financially liable for any potential stumbles.  But taxes are the main practical impediment to U.S.-based DAO incorporation, and this issue must be resolved in order for the DAO members to be more receptive to policies like the one passed in Wyoming. Under the present tax regime, it would be silly to expect San Francisco, Boston or Miami to become the Silicon Valley of DAOs. That is, unless the U.S. overhauls its existing tax code to be more lenient towards DAO members (which isn’t going to happen).",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Mark Lurie,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/11/18/dao-incorporation-us-tax-code,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/661182355f7a96ac2a0e8571c668c0c6b91aeb96-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411693,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfFZV,1668788282,What Is Crypto On-Chain Analysis and How Do You Use it?,"The vast majority of cryptocurrencies available on the market today use public blockchains to verify and record data. Because of this, the data is available “on-chain” for everyone to see, at any time and from anywhere in the world.  Sign up for CoinDesk’s Learn Crypto Investing Course.  On-chain analysis refers to the method of using information from a blockchain ledger to determine market sentiment. More specifically, it involves looking at transaction data and crypto wallet balances – two things that are useful when trying to decide whether to make an investment or not. After all, if a token isn’t being traded by anyone and a vast majority of its circulating supply is controlled by a handful of large holders, known as whales, then it’s probably not a good idea to invest in it.  On-chain tools you can use  Blockchain explorers like EtherScan for Ethereum and SnowTrace for Avalanche let you look up any wallet address or smart contract. But they don’t aggregate data or offer tools to make sense of the wealth of data points that exist.  In response, innumerable platforms and sources have sprung up that each offer insightful charts and dashboards to better help users visualize blockchain data and track the movements of crypto and individual wallets.  Many of these on-chain analytics platforms are either free or at least offer plenty of free features. Some of the popular ones include:  Glassnode  IntoTheBlock  Nansen  Dune Analytics  Messari  But on-chain analysis doesn’t tell you what to do. It's up to you to devise a strategy based on available information. Here are some suggestions on how to make the most out of the blockchain data dump.  Bitcoin movements  Bitcoin (BTC) is the world’s first viable cryptocurrency and the largest by market cap. Because of this, the price movements can often cause a domino effect throughout the rest of the market; meaning if the price of bitcoin rises, so, too, do other crypto assets, and vice versa. Thus, many investors typically keep a close eye on bitcoin’s on-chain activity.  Glassnode offers highly granular metrics for on-chain Bitcoin data, such as the movements of bitcoin whales, open interest in the futures trading market, mining difficulty and realized market cap. Some of the metrics are free to registered users, while others require a subscription.  Some metrics improve on existing ones and represent a combination of different data points that can be highly useful for identifying longer-term market trends.  The concept of Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) was proposed in 2011 by BitcoinTalk forum user “ByteCoin” as an alternative to the Transaction Volume metric, which, they said, doesn’t take into account data manipulations that happen when one address moves around the same coin multiple times. CDD gives more weight to how many days a coin has been kept, so someone who received one BTC 10 days ago would hold the same weight as someone moving 10 BTC received one day ago. That can give you insights into HODLing behavior of bitcoiners, as the following analysis making use of CDD suggests:  Although Glassnode offers a few charts for Ethereum, it is largely dedicated to Bitcoin. For smart contract activity, such as on-chain analysis of decentralized finance (DeFi) or non-fungible tokens (NFT), you’ll have to turn to other sources.  Smart contracts and the flow of smart money  In traditional finance, “smart money” refers to any capital that is controlled by professional investors, institutions and funds. The term has also entered the DeFi lexicon, where it refers to institutions like crypto venture capital funds or whales (those who hold proportionally large amounts of crypto).  Nansen is a popular source for tracking where smart money is flowing in and out. The platform has labelled more than 100 million individual wallets so that they don’t appear as 0x32456 but as “3 Arrow Capital” and so on. It offers free features including “Hot DeFi Contracts,” which lets you follow what projects those in-the-know are currently busy playing with, such as a liquidity pool on Avalanche as the picture below shows.  Data on specific projects  If you’re after data related to a specific DeFi or NFT project, you’re likely to find it on Dune Analytics, a free contributor-run platform that wants to be the GitHub of Web 3.  Just type the NFT project or DeFi protocol you want to know more about in the search bar. You can also try the “Discover” tab to see the most popular dashboards, such as Aave v3 activity on Optimism (a layer 2 scaling system):  Dune has a couple of dashboards similar to Nansen’s smart money tracking. For instance, you can see what the holders of the most expensive NFT collection, Bored Apes Yacht Club (BAYC), are buying and selling. But you’ll need to search for dashboards like these individually.  Read More: How to Use Dune Analytics  NFT insights  The recent white-hot trend of NFTs has also led to an array of on-chain analysis tools specifically focused on the NFT market.  CryptoSlam offers NFT sales volume, while Icy.Tools lets you view real-time sales data.  Because the price of items in an NFT collection are often determined by their rarities, traders use tools like Rarity.Tools and LuckyTrader to understand where an individual item’s rarity sits in a collection based on on-chain data.  BlockProbe is an example of a platform that has a Deal Spotter feature, which tells users when a particular NFT is selling at a bargain based on a collection’s data.  For big-picture analysis, one particularly popular source is Dune’s dashboard on OpenSea activity. NFT traders use this dashboard to gauge sentiment, with daily volumes of over $100 million generally thought to be an indicator of a bullish NFT market.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,Ekin Genç,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-crypto-on-chain-analysis-and-how-do-you-use-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9e4d460807f9f7c9d4e8fcf45f36180440d94fed-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Binance’s Bitcoin Exchange Reserve Has Sharply Spiked Up Over Past Day As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, Binance has received a massive Bitcoin deposit today. The relevant indicator here is the “exchange reserve,” which tells us the total amount of BTC currently sitting in the wallets of a centralized exchange. When the value of this metric goes down, it means investors are withdrawing their coins from the exchange right now. Such a trend, when sustained, could be bullish for the crypto’s price as it might be a sign of accumulation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Now Trading 24% Below Realized Price, How Deeper Can It Go? On the other hand, rises in the indicator suggest holders are transferring their BTC to the exchange’s wallets currently. As investors could be depositing for selling purposes, this kind of trend can be bearish for the coin’s value. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin exchange reserve of the crypto exchange Binance over the last few years: The value of the metric seems to have suddenly jumped up in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the Bitcoin exchange reserve for Binance sharply fell off earlier in the month. These outflows occurred as the crypto exchange FTX went belly up, reigniting fear among investors around central custody, and causing them to rush to withdraw their coins from such platforms. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash On Downward Motion Since Breaching $105 Level – Here’s Why In the last few days, however, Binance’s BTC reserve has once again started to trend up, implying that whales might be making moves to dump. And today, the indicator has very rapidly increased to a new high, as investors have made a massive deposit of 130k BTC to the exchange. At the moment, it’s unclear whether this is an organic increase in Binance’s Bitcoin reserve, or if it’s because of the exchange making some internal wallet shuffles that have been mistakenly picked up as fresh deposits by CryptoQuant’s metric. However, if it’s indeed a true spike, then the outcome from this could be bearish for the price of BTC. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price floats around $16.7k, down 3% in the last week. Over the past month, the crypto has lost 14% in value.

After the FTX saga that has troubled the hearts of many traders and investors, the price of Chiliz (CHZ) has given many a reason to be hopeful. The Domino effect of the FTX saga and other huge investors involved has left the market at a standstill as the market is yet to make a major move after previous weeks saw the price of Bitcoin (BTC) perform well, rallying from a low of $19,200 to a high of $21,600.

The fund said it invested $75 million in FTX International and its U.S. entity FTX.US in October 2021, and then another $20 million in FTX.US in January of this year, according to a statement. The investments were made through Teachers’ Venture Growth (TVG) platform and represented less than 0.05% of the fund's total net assets, the statement added.  ""The financial loss from this investment will have limited impact on the Plan, given its size relative to our total net assets and our strong financial position,"" said Ontario Teachers'.

42411066,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giBVkS,1668780767,'A Complete Failure of Corporate Controls': What Investors and Accountants Missed in FTX’s Audits,"On Nov. 2, CoinDesk’s Ian Allison lit the match that set the FTX empire built by quixotic founder Sam Bankman-Fried on fire.  Looking at financial reports dated June 30, Allison noted that FTX proprietary trading arm Alameda Research had $14.6 billion in assets on its balance sheet but that its single biggest asset was $3.66 billion of “unlocked FTT” and the third-largest “asset” was $2.16 billion more of “FTT collateral.”  Nearly 40% of Alameda’s assets consisted of FTT, a coin that Bankman-Fried himself more or less invented. It wasn’t an independently traded stablecoin or token with some volume and a market price or actual fiat in a reputable bank.  Francine McKenna is a lecturer in financial accounting at The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. Her 15-plus years of journalism experience includes roles at MarketWatch/WSJ, Forbes and American Banker. She currently produces a newsletter, The Dig, about public and pre-IPO companies.  Allison wrote that the situation suggested that ties between FTX and Alameda were unusually close. The story led to a Twitter war between Bankman-Fried and his former mentor Changpeng Zhao, who leads Binance, a rival exchange, and then a call for help from Bankman-Fried to Zhao that ended in a failed bailout. FTX and its 160-plus business units all filed for bankruptcy in Delaware nine days after the CoinDesk story that started the conflagration.  CoinDesk obtained the audited financial statements of West Realm Shires, also known as FTX US, and FTX Trading Ltd., the combined offshore Bahamas-based entity that includes an exchange catering to non-U.S. customers and Alameda, the proprietary trading operation.  It’s not clear why FTX commissioned two different audit firms to audit its 2020 and 2021 financial statements. The reports by Armanino LLP, which signed the report for the U.S. operation, and by Prager Metis LLP, which signed the opinion for the offshore operations, were issued at the end of March 2022.  Read more: David Z. Morris - 8 Days in November: What Led to FTX’s Sudden Collapse  Did some investors tighten their due diligence process after the Theranos debacle and insist on seeing information that had been vetted by CPAs? Or was FTX taking the first steps toward an initial public offering?  This month's blowup of Bankman-Fried's empire was like a meteor striking the crypto world, and the shock waves are still upending the industry. But if you knew where to look in the audited financial statements, there were signs that it was coming.  First red flag  The first red flag anyone receiving these reports should have seen is that there were two different audit firms producing them. Why hire two different firms rather than one to produce an opinion on consolidated results? With the benefit of hindsight, we can see it perhaps suggested that Bankman-Fried didn’t want any firm to see the whole picture.  The choice of firms itself is questionable. These are two small outfits, not even on the next tier to the Big Four global audit firms – Deloitte, Ernst &Young, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers. Armanino and Prager Metis do audit a few public companies but none of the size or complexity of FTX. Because the firms are so small, the audit regulator, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), inspects them only once every three years.  Prager Metis has a poor recent track record with the PCAOB (first reported by the Financial Times but publicly available here) and Armanino does, too.  Read more: Dan Kuhn - They Burned Down Crypto. Now They Want a Comeback  In 2019, the PCAOB published its private comments about deficiencies in Armanino’s overall quality-control processes related to its 2018 inspection because the firm hadn't corrected the board within a year.  Armanino was also the auditor for Lottery.com and issued an opinion for 2021. The lottery-sales startup reported that it had overstated its available unrestricted cash balance by $30 million and improperly recognized revenue. There was substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Armanino resigned from its audit role this past September, right before a class-action lawsuit was filed against Lottery.com's executives.  What were Deloitte and PwC doing for FTX?  Big Four Involvement  Forbes had previously reported that two Big Four global audit firms were also advising FTX. What were Deloitte and PwC doing for FTX?  Deloitte has made a name for itself in the crypto-friendly public company world as the go-to firm for guidance on the accounting for crypto investments and transactions. Right before its IPO in April 2021, Coinbase switched to Deloitte, which audited six months of financial information and then joined the previous auditor Grant Thornton in presenting its opinion in Coinbase’s first draft registration statement.  Coinbase provides a playbook for accounting for the crypto economy. Deloitte is also works with MicroStrategy – a software company known for its large bitcoin investments – to advise the company on its crypto accounting, despite not being its audit firm. That firm is KPMG.  CoinDesk also has evidence, based on PwC’s own internal systems, that PwC had taken steps to limit its services for FTX US to only those allowed for auditors of public companies. Its Washington, D.C., office posted restrictions for any PwC office seeking business with FTX, limiting the firm’s activities with FTX US in the way that is required for an auditor to be independent under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.  Perhaps PwC was helping FTX keep its tax bill at zero given its myriad investments and complex global structure. PwC is one of two preeminent Big Four firms (the other is EY) that provides most of the tax lobbying and strategic tax advice to global firms.  Audit firms have interpreted Sarbanes-Oxley as giving them wide latitude to provide all kinds of tax services, even to audit clients. PwC and EY have continued to provide complex tax-structuring and tax-avoidance services that have been scrutinized by the Internal Revenue Service and global tax authorities, even when also signing the audit opinion.  Second flag  The second red flag for any reader of the 2021 audit reports is that neither the Armanino nor the Prager Metis audit reports for 2021 provides an opinion on the FTX US or FTX Trading internal controls over accounting and financial reporting.  Thursday’s filing by FTX's new CEO, restructuring expert John J. Ray III, who was appointed after the FTX bankruptcy filing, confirms what reading the year-end 2021 financial statements should have screamed to any auditor or reader of the reports: There were no controls.  “Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as I occurred here,” he wrote.  “From compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad, to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals, this situation is unprecedented.”  (Ray was similarly appointed after the collapse of Enron in 2001.)  Because FTX is a private company, audits weren't required unless an investor or bank asked for them or if FTX was considering an IPO. That's not to mention that Dodd Frank and the subsequent Jobs Act have chipped away at the protections for investors created by the Sarbanes-Oxley to make internal controls opinions rarer even for companies that do go public.  Sarbanes-Oxley, which was passed after the Enron-era scandals, requires auditors to provide an opinion on the company’s internal controls over financial reporting and for management to provide an assessment of disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting.  This transaction is reminiscent of the web of related party transactions orchestrated by WeWork’s co-founder Adam Neumann  FTX, however, was large enough based on its revenue – combined revenue for its U.S. and offshore entities for 2021 according to the audit was $1.08 billion – and its potential market capitalization, to not fall under a Jobs Act exemption that relieves companies from providing an auditor’s report on internal controls, even after they have had an IPO.  Both audit firms wrote that their role is to, “Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of [West Realm Shires lnc.'s and FTX Trading Ltd. and subsidiaries'] internal control.”  However, in both cases, “no such opinion [on internal controls over financial reporting] is expressed.”  Third flag: No taxes paid  The third red flag is, despite a combination of enormous siphoning off of firm assets by related parties and favorable tax planning, neither FTX Trading nor FTX US paid any federal income taxes, although they both appeared to be profitable. FTX Trading's GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) net income was $386.5 million in 2021 and $16.7 million in 2020. FTX US reportedly lost $66.7 million on a GAAP basis in 2021, according to the Armanino audited financial statements. The U.S. firm’s activity in 2020 was negligible.      The biggest red flag  The biggest red flag for preparers and readers of the audited financial statements should have been the number of complex, roundtrip and utterly confounding related-party transactions documented in just these two years. The related-party transactions at FTX Trading are so numerous that it is difficult to know where to begin to analyze them.  The following are the red flags related to transactions between FTX Trading and a control person such as Bankman-Fried, who was acting outside of his role as owner/control person at FTX. The related-party transactions between FTX US and FTX Trading (Alameda and the offshore exchange) appear to be limited as of last Dec. 31.  Related-party music chairs  There are numerous related-party transactions documented for FTX Trading. The footnotes to the financial statements also notably say that the trading and exchange arms also have operations in the U.S. FTX Trading audit firm Prager Metis describes the scope of this set of financial statements and its audit of them as such:  FTX Trading Ltd. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries referred to herein as ""the Company,"" ""the Exchange,"" or ""FTX"") was incorporated in Antigua in 2019. The company operates globally, primarily in the Bahamas, which is the company's headquarters and Antigua, while also maintaining operations in the U.S., Switzerland, Turkey and Australia.  The first related-party activity relates to the role of individuals as liquidity providers, market makers and traders of the firm. Bankman-Fried and other insiders were trading on their own exchange for their own accounts.  Certain related-party entities were the initial liquidity providers and participated in a majority of the market-making transactions at the inception of the exchange. Over time, other liquidity providers joined the exchange, and the percentage of trades involving related parties has decreased as a percentage of total revenue. The related entities do trade for their own proprietary purposes on non-market making transactions.  Another massive red flag is the use of the FTX FTT token as currency for acquisitions  Liquidity provider, market making and trading exchange transactions with a related party represented about 6% and 11 % of total exchange transaction volume for the years ended Dec. 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Because the related parties were primarily market makers, which therefore generated negative commissions, net revenues (negative) for the years end December 31, 2021 and 2020 were -$22 million and -$13.4 million, respectively, which represented about 2.2% and 14.9% of total exchange transaction revenue on an absolute basis.  Another related-party transaction that has already been reported elsewhere is the exchange software royalty FTX paid to Bankman-Fried.  The exchange software royalty was developed by entities and parties that are significant shareholders. The exchange software was licensed from a related entity for a fee of about 25% of net exchange transaction revenue, depending on the revenue mix. The company has licensed the rights to the software code and the rights to further develop the technology.  The audited financial statements say that software royalties paid to Bankman-Fried for the years ended Dec. 31, 2021 and 2020 were $250.4 million and $22.7 million, respectively. The royalties were calculated based on 33% of net FTX exchange trading revenue, 10% of net additions to the insurance fund and 5% of net fees earned from other uses of FTX platform.  This transaction is reminiscent of the web of related-party transactions orchestrated by WeWork's co-founder Adam Neumann. For example, the startup purchased the trademark on the name ""We"" from him for $5.9 million.  Another highly unusual and perilous related party activity was the use of related parties to manage FTX currency and treasury activities on an “outsourced” basis.  Certain related parties have provided currency and treasury management activities to the company. Those services include that the related entities serve as conduits of fiat, or crypto transactions, maintaining an intercompany account for and on behalf of the company that is repayable on demand, and the provision of the same day conversion of revenue and expense transactions of crypto to U.S. dollars, all at the company's direction. A significant percentage of the company's bill-paying activities have been facilitated through these related-party service transactions.  The FTX Trading audit report says that these currency management transactions were made up of a significant portion of the customer fiat transactions and expense payments to vendors in both fiat and crypto transactions.      FTT for acquisitions  Another massive red flag, in line with Allison’s reporting about the dependence on the home-grown FTT token on Alameda’s balance sheet, is the use of the FTX FTT token as currency for acquisitions.  As notable crypto startups like BlockFi and Voyager Digital ran into financial troubles in the last year, Bankman-Fried often stepped in as a white knight. Bankman-Fried swept up Blockfolio, a trading app, reportedly for $150 million, in October 2021. Here is the FTX Trading/Prager Metis audit report language related to that last transaction:    The FTT receivable and liability are marked to market based on the quoted price for the FTT tokens at the reporting date. As of Dec. 31, 202 l and 2020, the receivable was $496.8 million and $44.6 million respectively, and is presented as ""receivable, related party"" in the shareholders' equity section on the consolidated balance sheets.  Why hire two different firms rather than one to produce an opinion on consolidated results?  Related parties entered into an FTX equity-for-FTT crypto option agreement. On Oct. 15, 2020, FTX agreed to purchase 52% of Blockfolio's shares outstanding for $83.6 million, but $78.7 million of this price was to be paid using FTT tokens. It’s in this footnote that we learn that “FTT was created by a related party to tokenize the royalty payments for the trading exchange technology platform licensed to FTX.” Why is that important?  FTX entered into an option with “a related party,” presumably Bankman-Fried, with the right to issue 32.5 million of the company's common shares and $1 million in exchange for 20 million FTT tokens to be delivered to Blockfolio’s selling shareholders on behalf of FTX. FTX immediately exercised the option and expected Bankman-Fried to send the tokens to Blockfolio.  FTT tokens were created by Bankman-Fried to “tokenize” the royalty payments paid to him by FTX Trading for the exchange software he created. FTX offloaded its obligation to Bankman-Fried to pay off Blockfolio in FTT tokens – tokens he created to “tokenize” the royalty payments he received from FTX for the exchange software – and he got more FTX shares in return. What happens to this obligation now that FTT tokens are worthless?  In the next transaction, it seems someone may have had impeccable timing in taking a receivable off the FTX books and benefitting personally. It is difficult to describe how insane and beyond the pale this transaction is from a fraud-risk and conflicts-of-interest perspective.  Another questionable transaction  In 2019, FTX issued 96.5 million Series A preferred shares in exchange for 1 million cryptographic BNB tokens issued by FTX rival Binance. The BNB tokens were subsequently loaned to a related party and were presented as ""BNB receivable, related party"" in FTX Trading's balance sheets as of Dec. 31, 2020. In February 202l, a related party purchased the BNB receivable for about $130.1 million.  Binance’s BNB tokens would have been a good token to have on FTX's balance sheet now. At current prices, 1 million BNB tokens would be worth $270.5 million. The FTX Series A preferred shares were issued against BNB (Binance) tokens that traded at $13 to $14 at the end of 2020, but, again, a related party purchased the BNB receivable in February 2021 for about $130.1 million.  The price of BNB tokens jumped significantly between Jan. 29, 2021 and Feb. 19, 2021 to $257.50 from about $44. If the related party bought before the jump in price, it got a huge bargain on the tokens. At $257.50, the related party overpaid.  More muddy waters  There’s another transaction that seems to have muddied the waters between the personal interests and professional responsibilities of key executives. In October 2021, a related party sold 12.8 million of the company's common shares to external investors in a secondary sale transaction for $301.8 million. The proceeds of the secondary sale were retained by FTX on behalf of the related party for operational expediency, and $301.8 million was included in “related party payable” on the consolidated balance sheets as of Dec. 31, 2021.  This $301.8 million may be the next real fiat cash that company top executives grabbed in a hurry on Nov. 11 as it belonged to one of them, according to the audit report.  On the other hand, Ray, the new FTX CEO, now says, according to a Bloomberg report of Thursday’s filing with the court, that the FTX audited financial statements shouldn't be trusted. “Advisors are working to rebuild balance sheets for FTX entities from the bottom up,"" he said.",NEGATIVE,BNB | FTT,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING | BNB | FTT,Francine McKenna,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/11/18/a-complete-failure-of-corporate-controls-what-investors-and-accountants-missed-in-ftxs-audits,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/10928a683c89202c88cdceb708da99e83b3e3bc7-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The bank also slashed its price target to $50 from $77. The shares were up marginally in premarket action to $49.23, but are down nearly 30% since the start of the month.  While BofA is confident that Coinbase is not another FTX, that doesn't “make the company immune from the broader fallout in the crypto market.  ”The analyst team sees three potential headwinds: Dampened trading activity thanks to weaker confidence in crypto, delayed regulatory clarity and the possibility that contagion leads to an even wider fallout for the industry,"" analysts from Bank of America wrote.  Longer term, the bank said, the FTX debacle may lead to market-share gains for Coinbase, because the exchange can point to its regulatory compliance and security of customer assets.  Bank of America had previously been a bull on Coinbase. In January, it gave the stock – at that time trading above $230 – a buy rating and $340 price target.

Ripple is looking to obtain a virtual asset service provider (VASP) license and already has two employees in the jurisdiction, which is a member of the European Union (EU), the company's General Counsel Stuart Alderoty told CNBC.  Ripple has turned its attention to countries outside the U.S. due to its ongoing lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, where the regulator alleges the company violated securities law with the sale of the XRP token. The company has already formed partnerships in France and Sweden.  “Essentially, its customers and its revenue are all driven outside of the U.S., even though we still have a lot of employees inside of the U.S.,” Alderoty told CNBC.  Once the exchange has this Irish license, Ripple wants to ""passport"" its services across Europe, Alderoty told CNBC. It is also going to file an application for an electronic money license in Ireland, he added.  Crypto firms have been opting to enter the EU due to its advances in regulating the sector.

Managing partners Kyle Samani and Tushar Jain write in a 3,400-word letter that the FTX fiasco does not spell doom for the crypto industry, as critics like Peter Schiff and Nassim Taleb recently did. “Just as Lehman Brothers didn’t kill banking and Enron wasn’t the death of energy companies, FTX won’t be the end of the crypto industry,” the venture capital firm said. At the same time, the firm warns its investors that FTX’s collapse will cause more fallouts. Samani and Tushar wrote: We expect to see contagion fallout from FTX/Alameda over the next few weeks. Many trading firms will be wiped out and shut down, which will put pressure on liquidity and volume throughout the crypto ecosystem. We have seen several announcements already on this front, but expect to see more. According to Multicoin, leverage must first be removed from the system before there will be “green shoots next year.” Multicoin Trusted FTX Samani’s company also acknowledged its own mistakes, though. Thus, it had placed “too much trust” in FTX. As a result, Multicoin lost 15.6% of its total fund assets on FTX. Related Reading: Did The Bahamas’ Securities Commission Take Control of FTX’s Assets? They Did The venture firm was only able to recover about a quarter of its funds that were deposited on the exchange. Although waiting to see how the bankruptcy proceedings progress, the company expects to write down its investment in FTX to zero. In doing so, Multicoin follows the fate of other investors in FTX, such as Temasek, Sequoia Capital and Softbank. Due to the loss of confidence, Multicoin said it is only trading on two other exchanges, Coinbase and Binance. For now, however, the company only relies on Coinbase custody and self-managed cold wallets, it said. The Future Of Solana (SOL) By its own account, Multicoin has invested a large amount in Solana (SOL). The token was one of the biggest sufferers in the FTX collapse, as SOL was one of FTX’s largest positions along with FTT. On November 05, SOL was still trading at a price of $38.71 on Binance before the steep crash to currently $13.53 took place. Despite the heavy losses, Multicoin officially still believes in Solana’s long-term potential, according to its letter to investors. The venture firm said it’s holding its position and still expects a bright future for Solana, because the cryptocurrency has “one of the most vibrant developer communities.” Related Reading: Solana Buckles Under FTX Debris, Is Single-Digit SOL A Possibility? Based on our experience in 2018 and 2020, we learned that it’s not prudent to sell an asset during a short-lived crisis if the core thesis is not impaired,” the letter states. However, there is a juicy (unconfirmed) rumor circulating that Samani and Jain handled his personal funds differently. Allegedly, the general partners sold their personal SOL stashes near the top.

Most long-term crypto investors realize this has little to do with the asset class itself and has more to do with how and where crypto is invested. Rather than hurt the legitimacy of the crypto industry, this event will likely help reshape the way regulators look at the crypto industry and also reshape the way investors choose to invest in crypto based on custody. FTX ( FTT-USD ) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Friday, November 11 after a series of revelations regarding the company’s financial stability triggered a liquidity event when investors were rapidly attempting to withdraw their funds. The crash affected more than 5 million customers globally, including retail customers and hedge funds that are now stuck trying to recover their funds after FTX halted withdrawals. But it isn’t just FTX’s customers which are affected - the FTX crash shook the entire crypto industry and stimulated withdrawals from other exchanges and a broader collapse in crypto prices. Since early November, Bitcoin fell approximately 20% to under $17,000 (as of November 15). Ethereum also fell over 24% to $1,250 during that same time period.But does this hurt the long-term viability of the crypto industry? Probably not - most long-term crypto investors realize this has little to do with the asset class itself and has more to do with how and where crypto is invested. Rather than hurt the legitimacy of the crypto industry, this event will likely help reshape the way regulators look at the crypto industry and also reshape the way investors choose to invest in crypto based on custody. A few key takeaways are below: Downturn In Crypto Prices This Year (Author) Crypto exchanges and platforms do not offer the same protections as a bank account or brokerage account. While the FTX incident has been highly publicized, this isn’t the first time an incident like this has happened. In May, Terra Luna ( LUNC-USD ) crashed, bringing attention to “uncollateralized algorithmic stablecoins.” In June, Celsius Network ( CEL-USD ), a crypto lending company, froze withdrawals and later filed for bankruptcy owing approximately $4.7 billion to its customers. In July, crypto brokerage Voyager Digital ( VYGVQ ) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy with $1.3 billion in crypto assets. All of these incidents were worsened by the fact that there were very few regulations in place to protect customers from liquidity events and bankruptcies, including proof of reserves or insurance protections (unlike with traditional banks/brokerage firms). For example, the FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) insures $250,000 per depositer, per insured bank. Similarly, the SIPC (Securities Investor Protection Corporation) insures up to $500,000, which includes a $250,000 limit for cash. Additionally, it’s difficult to protect investors who are using offshore platforms like FTX, especially when they are attracted by celebrity endorsements or high staking yields. Higher yields are sometimes too good to be true. Investors who bought TerraUSD ( UST-USD ) were attracted to a 20% yield which was earned by buying UST and lending it to a platform called Anchor. Similarly, Celsius and FTX both offered high staking yields on certain coins that were in the double-digit percent range. But staking can be both unsustainable and risky, since deposits are lent out to other borrowers - and at such high yields, it is easy for the amount of deposits to exceed the amount of borrowings. As an alternative to exchanges, investors may likely explore one of two methods for investing on crypto. On one extreme, some buy-and-hold investors may choose to hold crypto through crypto wallets rather than tie up funds in an exchange. Before the crypto industry grew more popular, investors originally bought crypto and stored it in wallets where they had a private key. This gave them the benefit of maintaining custody of their own crypto holdings. Some investors eventually moved away from this method because it was easy to lose your private key (there is no help desk or password recovery system) and also more convenient to execute short-term trade on exchanges. On the other extreme, some investors who want to participate in the crypto asset class performance may choose to gain indirect access through crypto funds. Futures-based ETFs like the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ) have almost perfect correlation with Bitcoin but hold futures contracts instead of actual bitcoins. Similarly, crypto-equity ETFs like the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF ( SATO ) hold stocks of companies that operate in the crypto economy along with some exposure to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ). GBTC stores assets in offline or “cold” storage with a custodian (meaning that assets are less vulnerable to a cyberattack) and does not borrow or lend the underlying assets (reducing the risk of a liquidity event). Investors who prefer the ease of crypto exchanges may be more likely to use U.S.-based exchanges like Coinbase ( COIN ) which have some regulatory oversight. Coinbase, for example, is a publicly traded company within the U.S. which has oversight by the SEC. Like any public company, Coinbase releases audited annual financials, which makes it easier for customers to perform due diligence on compared to offshore exchanges like FTX who also have close ties to trading platforms. Coinbase also stores assets offline and holds client assets 1:1, meaning that the company does not use customer funds for commercial purposes like lending or trading. This means that in the case of a liquidity event, clients should be able to withdraw their funds at any time of the day. These are important factors for clients to consider when using an exchange - How are my assets stored? Can I withdraw them at any time of the day? Is the exchange closely linked to a lender or does it operate on its own? By asking these questions, clients can better understand the risk behind certain platforms and exchanges. Bottom Line While the FTX crash has obviously been a shock to the broader crypto market, the event brings to light several key issues regarding regulation and custody. When the market volatility settles, investors will likely be more wary of offshore crypto exchanges and explore other methods of investing in crypto, including private wallets, crypto ETFs, or U.S.-based exchanges.

42414854,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBTX5T,1668774867,BofA: Don’t Tarnish Blockchain Technology With Speculative Crypto Trading,"It is important to separate speculative crypto trading and token prices from the underlying blockchain technology, Bank of America (BAC) said in a research report Thursday after a group of major banks and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York started testing the use of digital tokens representing dollars.  Citigroup (C), HSBC (HSBC), BNY Mellon (BK) and Wells Fargo (WFC) are among those taking part, as is payments giant Mastercard (MA), the New York Fed said on Tuesday.  Despite the backlash following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX and its sister company Alameda Research, “the development of applications that leverage distributed ledger and blockchain technology continues to advance,” analysts Alkesh Shah and Andrew Moss wrote.  The benefits of a wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC) include faster settlement time, which could allow financial institutions to reallocate funds that had been otherwise held as collateral into yield-bearing investments, the bank said. Other positives include reduced costs, lower credit risk and increased transparency.  Bank of America says a wholesale CBDC may be issued before a retail CBDC “due to less complexity related to design, privacy and banking system disintermediation.”  Central banks and governments are expected to drive digital asset innovation by leveraging the private sector, the note said, and this will create new revenue streams. Governments may give contracts to payments and consulting firms for their expertise, but the larger revenue opportunity likely exists for “infrastructure providers that offer distributed ledger platforms, cloud storage, cybersecurity, digital asset custody/wallets and telecom for offline access.”  Potential beneficiaries will depend on what type of CBDC implementation approach is used, according to the report.

""We feel confident that COIN is not 'another FTX' (only $15M of deposits on FTX platform per a Coinbase blog post and $5B of cash on hand as of 9/30), but that does not make them immune from the broader fallout within the crypto ecosystem,"" the analyst said in a note to clients. Meanwhile, COIN shares rose 0.5% in Friday premarket trading. Kupferberg mentioned three potential near/medium-term headwinds: Diminished confidence in the crypto universe, especially on the part of of retail users, is likely to dampen overall trading activity; Regulatory clarity may be delayed, but any proposed/enacted regulation is likely to be restrictive and/or expensive for exchanges; Contagion risk and broader fallout from FTX could linger.

The assessment will require firms to provide all retail communication concerning crypto assets distributed between July 1 and Sept. 30 of this year, according to an announcement made by FINRA on Monday.  Retail communication includes “any written (including electronic) communication that is distributed or made available to more than 25 retail investors within any 30 calendar-day period,” the notice said. It added that and ""video, social media, mobile applications, and websites generally fall into this communications category.""  Regulators around the world are increasingly scrutinizing the crypto sector and calling for more transparency and regulation following the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX exchange. FINRA itself had, in January, already announced that it was looking to change regulations for crypto when it comes to advertising and disclosure. Crypto ads and promotions in particular have peaked regulators' interests as companies like FTX invested millions of dollars in marketing strategies – including Super Bowl ads – targeting retail investors.  FINRA's ""targeted exams"" are designed for gathering information and carrying out investigations, with the goal of pinpointing appropriate regulatory responses, according to its website.  The targeted exam for crypto communications will be looking into all approved crypto communications in the specified period and if they included a FINRA reference number. It will also assess what compliance policies, manuals or training materials were provided in the same time period regarding communication.  CoinDesk has reached out to FINRA for comment.

However, “proof of reserves, at least in the form they’ve been suggested, have too many shortcomings to inspire confidence,” Bank of America (BAC) said in a research report Thursday.  The bank notes that many exchanges have already reported, or are planning to report, their assets through proof of reserves using Merkle trees. These are efficient data structures called “hash trees” that can be securely verified. They behave as a map of customers' funds and work even when reserves become complicated.  Read more: Proof of Reserves: Could it Have Prevented the FTX Meltdown?  Among the shortcomings, assets are shown at a fixed point in time, which gives opportunities for manipulation, such as borrowing assets right before the snapshot is taken, the note said.  In addition, proof of liabilities is required to determine leverage and the safety of assets, and proof-of-reserve procedures often rely on third-party audit firms that can be manipulated or “may even be created by the trading platform itself,” the note added. And, even if users notice asset-liability mismatches, there is no stop button.  Stablecoin reserves also need to be audited and not just displayed. Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to another asset such as the U.S. dollar, and are the equivalent of cash in the crypto world.  While not a shortcoming of proof of reserves, the crypto industry also needs a clear delineation between trading platforms and market makers, the report said.  Most importantly, it needs regulation, the bank said, adding that FTX’s regulatory status in the Bahamas means it is unclear if founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried violated any laws, given that FTX was not regulated as a broker-dealer.  Decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volumes are expected to continue increasing until confidence is restored, the note added.

USDA will be the first fully fiat-backed, regulatory-compliant stablecoin in the Cardano ecosystem.  “The introduction of a fully fiat-backed, regulatory-compliant stablecoin is the next step in realizing the future for our community,” wrote Emurgo Fintech Managing Director Vineeth Bhuvanagiri in a note to CoinDesk.  Stablecoins are tokens backed by an asset, or a basket of assets, and pegged to fiat currency, such as the U.S. dollar. They serve as an entryway to the crypto market for traditional market participants and are extensively used within the ecosystem as instruments for trading, borrowing and lending.  USDA is part of Emurgo’s Anzens product, a broader plan that would offer users several financial services and products functioning on Cardano-based assets. These plans include lending and borrowing services, crypto-based card payments and bridges between traditional markets and decentralized applications (dapps).  This could help bolster Cardano’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, which locks just over $53 million in value as of Friday, per DeFiLlama data. That’s an 82% slide since March highs of over $300 million.  USDA is expected to launch on the Anzens platform in Q1 2023 where users will be able to tokenize their USD into USDA via credit/debit cards, wire transfer or conversion of Cardano's native ADA token, Emurgo said.  Emurgo has partnered with a regulated financial services company based in the United States as the banking partner to issue USDA, ensuring the stablecoin is fully compliant and adheres to regulatory guidelines, Emurgo said, without naming the company.  Alongside the tokenization of USD, Emurgo will soon enable the conversion of other stablecoins, such as USD Coin (USDC) and tether (USDT) to USDA, with long-term plans to enable conversion and swaps of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and other cryptocurrencies.

Chainlink Offers Its Proof-of-Reserve Product As FTX Crash Rocks The Crypto Market Chainlink Labs’ proof-of-reserve product was offered on Nov. 10 to help solve future trust problems in the crypto exchange market. Chainlink Labs posed the question in a series of tweets: “Will crypto continue to repeat the mistakes of the traditional black-box financial industry? Or will a better system emerge?” In response, it offered its proof-of-reserve (PoR) solution. Chainlink stated it could validate centralized exchange asset reserves, off-chain bank account balances, cross-chain collateral, real-world asset reserves, and more. Recently, the crypto market has been in freefall due to a liquidity problem at the second-largest crypto exchange, FTX. In response to these persistent challenges, the crypto community has been discussing solutions. One possibility is for users to need Proof-of-Reserve from every exchange they use. Using a proof of reserve, customers may conduct an instantaneous audit of cryptocurrency exchanges’ reserves. Several exchanges have begun to adopt proof of reserve, and Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has suggested that all exchanges should implement it soon. However, several marketplaces have claimed that developing a proof-of-reserves system will take weeks, if not longer. Chainlink Labs rebutted by saying their offering is an “out-of-the-box” answer that exchanges can start using right now. What The Charts Say About Chainlink Since May, LINK has fluctuated in price between $9.45 and $5.62 (yellow), with a mid-price of $7.54. The range’s midpoint has provided strong support and resistance within this time. Bearish momentum was indicated by a Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading below 50 and a Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) reading below -0.05. Both indicators point to considerable outflows of money from the market. Related Reading: KuCoin Token (KCS) Loses 12% Amidst Top Coins Bleeding The fall of LINK from $9 to a swing low of $5.7 in November also severely impacted OBV. Yet, the OBV has shown a trend of higher lows since July. This was evidence that some LINK tokens had been accumulated over time. The $6.3 support level has held firm over the previous six months. In recent months, the $6.3 and $5.9 price points were clearly visible as support levels in the lower time frames. Chainlink has yet to drop below the range of lows despite the severe market volatility of the previous week. As of writing, Chainlink still trades at the $6.3 level, a 1.36% decrease intraday.

The go-to fan token was seen keeping an intraday profit of 7.37%. It reached a local high of $0.246 during the day before retracting to its current price of $0.242. Despite falling below its trading-day floor, it quickly bounced back, leaving traders with substantial profits. CHZ week-on-week charts also indicate bullish momentum for the fan-themed token. Holding 8.58% profits, CHZ’s price looks confident over the entire market as tokens struggle to gain some ground. Despite the World Cup anticipation driving high trading volume, CHZ’s founder’s offer to bail out stranded FTX users also helped push prices higher. Related Reading: Grayscale Liquidation Could Unleash A Bitcoin Armageddon As per data retrieved from CoinMarketCap, CHZ also holds gains against the top guns. At press time, CHZ held over 5% gains ahead of BTC and ETH. The token is already on a path to touch its intraday high and might see a positive break out. CHZ Founder Isn’t so Bullish On NFTs In The Sports Industry Due to its connection with sports tokens, Chiliz has experienced a resurgence in investor interest in its native cryptocurrency, CHZ. Alexandre Dreyfus has seized the chance to emphasize why Chiliz has a promising future in the sports sector. The CEO talked about NFTs, which he mentioned was an awesome way to connect fans with their favorite teams. However, Dreyfus mentioned that most NFTs in the market lack utility. He added that this is a major reason why fans lose interest in these initiatives over time. Dreyfus added that scalability might not be NFTs’ strongest suit. As a substitute, he said that fan tokens are a fantastic way to scale a team. This is so that teams may utilize them to create powerful digital communities since they are fungible. He added; It’s this ability to provide access and individual recognition to audiences at huge scale that sets Fan Tokens apart. CHZ Active Wallets Increase As Supply On Exchanges Fall The number of active addresses (30-day) has increased since November 6th. This demonstrated greater user interaction and may be a sign of an optimistic mood. Additionally, the weighted sentiment score was in the green, indicating that CHZ had a good social media outlook. However, on-chain metrics revealed that throughout November, the percentage of supply on exchanges had decreased. This is quite unlikely, considering the huge drop in price within the week. Specifically, CHZ saw a price dump on the 14th that took its value to the $1.88 region. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash On Downward Motion Since Breaching $105 Level – Here’s Why This drop is further witnessed in its 24-hour trading volume. Despite posting impressive intraday and week-on-week gains, the token trading volume dropped 24.38%. Even after all these, CHZ tokens have been moved off of exchanges. Given these stats, its active wallet increase might indicate that traders are not looking to spend their CHZ in the short term. This also suggests that there may be a buildup from bigger market participants.

4416756,https://newsbtc.com/?p=509177,1668764236,Did The Bahamas’ Securities Commission Take Control of FTX’s Assets? They Did,"The Bahamas struck first and struck hard. Yesterday, there were rumors going around that their government was pressuring Sam Bankman-Fried to give them control of FTX’s assets. What sounded like a bizarre story was more than confirmed today. The Securities Commission of The Bahamas released an official document announcing the takeover. Of course, they did it to protect the interests of FTX’s clients. It was urgent. Related Reading: Paolo Ardoino Talks FTX, Adoption And Self-Custody With NewsBTC The document began: “On 12 November 2022, the Securities Commission of The Bahamas (“the Commission”), in the exercise of its powers as regulator acting under the authority of an Order made by the Supreme Court of The Bahamas, took the action of directing the transfer of all digital assets of FTX Digital Markets Ltd. (“FDM”) to a digital wallet controlled by the Commission, for safekeeping. Urgent interim regulatory action was necessary to protect the interests of clients and creditors of FDM.” To accomplish that, The Bahamas completely ignored the bankruptcy procedures opened in the United States. “It is not the understanding of the Commission that FDM is a party to the US Chapter 11 Bankruptcy proceedings,” the Securities Commission of The Bahamas said bluntly. And then, they took control of the situation. “Over the coming days and weeks, the Commission will engage with other regulators and authorities, in multiple jurisdictions, to address matters affecting the creditors, clients and stakeholders.” In case anyone doubts it, The Bahamas clarifies that “the Commission is responsible for the administration of the Digital Assets and Registered Exchanges Act.” FTT price chart for 11/18/2022 on FTX | Source: FTT/USD on TradingView.com FTX’s New Management Warned About The Bahamas Intentions Yesterday, The Wall Street Journal reported on FTX’s new management’s concerns with The Bahamas government’s intentions. “Lawyers for FTX’s new management also said in court papers that the government of the Bahamas is disrupting the exchange’s chapter 11 case, filed last week in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware. The papers escalate a budding dispute for control of FTX’s insolvency proceedings between its U.S. management and securities regulators in the Bahamas.” At the time, who would’ve thought that The Bahamas was going to move that fast? Maybe we should have because in that same article the WSJ informed us that “The Securities Commission tapped lawyer Brian Simms KC to oversee the liquidation of FTX”. Plus, “a Bahamian court approved Mr. Simms’s appointment on Thursday”. A few days later, Simms “filed a chapter 15 petition in U.S.” What is a chapter 15, and what does it imply? Back to the article: “The chapter 15 filing, if successful, could move at least a portion of FTX’s bankruptcy proceedings to courts in the Bahamas. Mr. Simms said Tuesday in a sworn declaration the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas has sole jurisdiction over FTX Digital and other entities operated from the company’s “substantial office complex” in Nassau, Bahamas.” Now that the government of The Bahamas apparently took possession of the assets, the U.S doesn’t seem to have a choice but to work with them.

Among the rumors that circulated yesterday, there was one that said that he was being forced to “hack” into FTX and surrender custody of the assets. Plus, Bankman-Fried recently said that filling for Chapter 11 in the US was his biggest mistake so far. Could he be trying to revert the operation with the help of the government of The Bahamas?

Cryptocurrency price index Coingecko reports that NEAR’s price is currently bearish, reflecting the general market sentiment. At the time of writing, the token was trading at $1.8515, below the key psychological $2 zone. Major investors’ loss of faith in cryptocurrencies following the FTX debacle has contributed to the current gloomy sentiment on the cryptocurrency market. Because of this, other markets where traders with FTX positions also suffered catastrophic losses. Recent research indicates NEAR has a neutral outlook, suggesting the token’s futures interest is bullish. However, the token’s bearish break below $2 may be indicative of more market weakness. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash On Downward Motion Since Breaching $105 Level – Here’s Why Negative Mood For NEAR Although past performance is not a guarantee of future results, it does influence traders’ and investors’ perceptions of an asset’s value. NEAR is experiencing exactly this, as the market structure is extremely negative at the moment. The coin’s RSI readings are also not encouraging. After a moment of hesitation, it reversed its neutral stance. Since October 31st, the Chaikin money flow indicator has likewise been consistently showing a downward trend, falling below the neutral band. It has been made much worse by recent occurrences in the cryptospace. As of this writing, the indicator is -0.23, suggesting that bears are now in charge of the market. Bollinger bands indicate a huge increase in volatility that could result in a bullish near future, despite the current bearishness. This marginally positive near-term outlook is further backed by the 20-day triple EMA, which has recently flipped from resistance to support. Short-Term Advantage Likely Nonetheless, the 50-day triple EMA continues to function as price barrier. This discrepancy in timelines can be seen as a short-term advantage for NEAR. A $2 bearish breach is seen to increase market’s suffering. The previously mentioned analysis may prove accurate. On the NEAR futures market, short-term investors and traders can utilize the positive OI (Open Interest). However, long-term traders will face a difficult choice: sell now and realize their losses, or hold and hope for a possible bull run. The first scenario is more probable than the second. As the currency loses its $2 psychological support, the confidence of investors and traders will decrease. This is already evident in NEAR’s RSI data. If conditions continue to deteriorate daily, NEAR might fall to $1.5575. A level that has not been witnessed in almost a year.

4411655,https://newsbtc.com/?p=509117,1668757341,Grayscale Liquidation Could Unleash A Bitcoin Armageddon,"The FTX Contagion effects do not even stop at the largest institutional Bitcoin product on the market, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). As a result of the bankruptcy of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto exchange, the discount to the NAV of Grayscale’s GBTC fund has fallen to around -40%. As recently as the end of 2020, GBTC was trading at a premium of +40%. However, in January 2021, the trend reversal occurred when Grayscale’s Bitcoin fund traded at a discount for the first time. Since then, GBTC has been on a downward slide. GBTC’s largest owners include Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest (0.85%), Horizon Kinetics (0.34%), Simplify Asset Management (0.06%) Systelligence (0.04%), Parkwood (0.04%), Emerald Mutual Fund (0.03%) and Rothschild Investment (0.01%), according to CNN Business. Doomsday for Bitcoin Recent events have led Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to become potentially the single biggest risk to the Bitcoin market. As NewsBTC reported, Genesis Global had to pause all withdrawals for its lending business on Wednesday due to “unprecedented market turmoil.” This is concerning for the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust in that Genesis Global served as the liquidity provider for the trust. Genesis Global’s parent company is Digital Currency Group (DCG). This in turn is also the parent company of Grayscale. Shortly after the Genesis announcement, Digital Currency Group clarified that the matter would have no impact on its own business. DCG stated that Genesis is not a service provider “for any” Grayscale product. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prediction: Is the Recovery Just Getting Started? Furthermore, the company asserted that it does not lend, borrow, or pledge Bitcoin, and that its custodian – Coinbase – is prohibited from engaging in such activities. In addition, SEC and OTC markets reports and audited financial statements are filed. Grayscale products continue to operate business as usual, and recent events have had no impact on product operations. The assets underlying $GBTC and all Grayscale products remain safe and secure, held in segregated wallets in deep cold storage by our custodian Coinbase . Still, the community is bellyaching. A dissolution of GBTC could mean Armageddon for Bitcoin. The collapse of Terra Luna, on the other hand, would have been fun. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust currently holds 634,000 BTC. The Terra Luna Foundation “only” liquidated 80,000 Bitcoins, and still managed to crash the BTC price from $40,000 to $20,000. As Ryan Selkis reported, DCG is in a liquidity squeeze. “Appears holding company’s (DCG) liquid assets are below liabilities. As a result, it looks like DCG is looking to raise outside funding”. However, this tweet is now deleted. Related Reading: El Salvador President Says Country Will Buy 1 Bitcoin A Day The Bitcoin community is now demanding proof that Grayscale actually holds roughly 634,000 BTC in reserve at Brian Armstrong’s Coinbase. However, neither Grayscale nor Coinbase have shown any reaction so far. All that is currently available is a CSV file that is updated daily. As analyst Dylan LeClair explained, it should be relatively feasible to produce a proof of reserves if all BTCs are held at Coinbase. Does anyone know of the addresses for the 630k BTC in $GBTC? Are there some form of proof of reserves and if no, why? We have a fully transparent public ledger so we can audit this stuff. All I can find is a CSV file that updates daily. Why not publish the addresses? — Dylan LeClair 🟠 (@DylanLeClair_) November 17, 2022 But criticism also heads towards the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. If chairman Gary Gensler had approved the conversion of GBTC into an ETF, the Armageddon scenario would not even exist. Instead, Gensler preferred to reject spot Bitcoin ETFs and flood the market with paper BTC. The FTX fiasco may also contribute to the lack of approval for a spot ETF in the near future. Meanwhile, Chris Burniske, partner at Placeholder and former crypto chief at ARKinvest, tweeted that fears surrounding the unwinding of GBTC and ETHE are unfounded, an example of hysteria. He retweeted Bob Loukas who wrote that the trust will not go away as it is a money printing machine. They generate like $700m in fees and investors can’t stop it. They could borrow billions against that cash flow. Also, You’re not killing the goose to save Genesis. They’re fire-walled. At press time, Bitcoin investors seemed to agree with Chris Burniske.

4411526,https://newsbtc.com/?p=509135,1668757144,Bitcoin Cash On Downward Motion Since Breaching $105 Level – Here’s Why,"There has been significant sideways fluctuation in the price of bitcoin recently, and it is currently trading in the $16,541 area. However, Bitcoin Cash, a spinoff of BTC, has seen its value drop after passing through the $105 threshold. BCH may need BTC for a rally, as there is a strong market correlation between the two. At the time of writing, the token was trading at $102.21, which is far lower than the $126 price range that swiftly rejected any potential bull run. The current market environment is further adding to the unfavorable mood towards BCH. Related Reading: Quant Wallet Holders Reach More Than 90,000 – Time To Buy QNT? Image: TradingView What Bitcoin Cash Metrics Show BCH’s price has been steadily decreasing since it was rejected at $165 earlier this year. However, as was previously mentioned, BCH is highly correlated with BTC, which is experiencing strong sideways motion at the present time. The BCH price may be affected by factors other than correlation. According to CoinGlass, long traders are still active despite the current bearish market sentiment. As long as investors continue to cling onto Bitcoin Cash, the currency will continue to go sideways. In addition, position liquidation is rather minimal, coming in at $242,400. In spite of this, the data shows that the vast majority of liquidations are long positions, suggesting that long traders are selling their BCH at a loss. However, the presence of long traders indicates that the market sentiment is negative but relatively optimistic in the long run. Nonetheless, if the price falls below $99.47, the number of short traders will surely exceed the number of long traders. BCH: Bearish Market Prognosis A negative breach of the $99.47 price range might ignite a BCH market sell-off, pushing the price down $88.22. However, investors and traders should examine BCH’s association with Bitcoin, as the correlation coefficient sits at 0.94 as of this writing. Current market dynamics indicate a gloomy future for BCH. The last time the present trading range was observed was in 2018. This revisiting of the aforementioned trading range will surely enhance the market’s existing bearish momentum. With the cryptospace in risk with the FTX’s demise, a bull run in the coming weeks or months is unlikely. As market sentiment remains adverse, this crypto winter would push investors to keep or sell. Investors and traders could take advantage of BCH’s link with BTC, but if the market scenario deteriorates, they could anticipate further losses in the days to come.

The open-source protocol has been one of the few ecosystems to stay afloat following the FTX saga. Specifically, TON posted a 3.28% gain intraday with a week-on-week rise of over 13%. TON also gained ground against the top two cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum. The token was seen holding up gains of 2.22% against BTC and 3.09% above ETH. Its intraday price movement is still bullish, despite dropping below its floor mid-day. Related Reading: Litecoin Shows Bullish Signs As Price Eyes $70; Will Bulls Push To This Region? Very few tokens have successfully kept substantial gains as the FTX case unfolds. However, TON has confidently left traders smiling all week and isn’t looking to stop anytime soon. The main catalyst behind TON’s rise is still Telegram’s new username auction feature. Furthermore, a leading blockchain market maker has pledged a huge amount to support the TON ecosystem. A Telegram User Paid $500,000 For The ‘Dogecoin’ Username The Telegram username auction has seen enormous trading volume despite just launching this week. Many users have struggled to get the best usernames, with some costing higher than others. However, one username has caught the attention of many members of the crypto community. As per data retrieved on November 17th, an unknown user purchased the username of the meme coin ‘Dogecoin’ for 350,000TON. This price is roughly $546,000 when converted. The username is one of the most expensive sold on the blockchain’s Fragment NFT marketplace. Specifically, it’s the 8th most expensive Telegram profile username sold on the blockchain. Its price is higher than those of @alfa, @cash, @amazon, @adidas, @gold, @armani, @dior, and even @elon. Topping the list is @auto, which a user bought for 900,000 TON. This is worth approximately $1.43 million. TON Getting $10 Million In Support From Market Maker Popular market maker DWF Labs has entered a new partnership with the TON blockchain. This new deal will see the open-source protocol getting support in the form of investments, token and market development, and exchange listing. The Durov brothers, who founded Telegram Messenger, first conceptualized The Open Network in 2018. Later, they gave it to the open TON Community, who have been sustaining and expanding it ever since. TON was created with user-friendliness and scalability in mind for quick and inexpensive transactions. DWF Labs’ investment will consist of 50 seed investments planned over the next 12 months and $10 million to support the ecosystem. All of these are intended to hasten the expansion of TON and its initiatives. Related Reading: Ep07- Moneyland – Companion Guide For BBC’s “The Missing Cryptoqueen” Podcast DWF Labs’ involvement is anticipated to boost TON’s volume across supporting platforms. This will further help to expand the number of ecosystem users. The blockchain’s trading volume is also expected to see a significant boost. As of writing, the token’s 24-hour volume was at $11,956,672, a 26.92% increase. The market maker plans to expand the trading volume further by creating an OTC market. This will enable buyers and sellers to conduct large transactions with ease.

LTC’s price trades above $60 with the market’s current state, as things look uncertain for most traders and investors. LTC’s price bounces from a low of $50 on the daily timeframe as the price aims for a rally to $70 above the 50 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) The price action displayed by Litecoin (LTC) in recent times has been encouraging after the FTX saga that has troubled the hearts of many traders and investors, giving many a reason to be hopeful. The Domino effect of the FTX saga and other huge investors involved has left the market at a standstill as the market is yet to make a major move after previous weeks saw the price of Bitcoin (BTC) perform well, rallying from a low of $19,200 to a high of $21,600. Most altcoins trend higher as many produced gains of over 200%, including DOGE rallying from a region of $0.55 to a high of $0.15. Still, these expectations were cut short by the uncertainty surrounding the crypto market, but this has yet to deter the price of Litecoin (LTC) from performing well in recent times. (Data from Binance) Related Reading: Quant Wallet Holders Reach More Than 90,000 – Time To Buy QNT? Litecoin (LTC) Price Analysis On The Weekly Chart The past few days have been filled with so much turbulence in the crypto space as many altcoins have struggled to show strength after losing their key support holding off price decline. The current uncertainty surrounding the market has resulted in reluctance on the part of traders and investors to make altcoin purchases, as there is no assurance if they would be heading up any time soon. FTX news hugely impacted the price of LTC, sending the price into a spiral movement to a region of $50 as the price bounced off this region with what looked like a temporary demand zone to hold off a big sell-off. The price of LTC bounced off this region showing some great strength to a region of $60 as the price aims to break higher to $70. The price of LTC needs to hold above $60 for more signs of relief toward $70. Weekly resistance for the price of LTC – $70. Weekly support for the price of LTC – $60. Price Analysis Of LTC On The Daily (1D) Chart The price of LTC remains considerably strong in the daily timeframe as the price trades above $60 support after bouncing off from the region of $50. If the price of LTC holds above $60, we could see more rallies for the LTC price; a break below a region of $60 would be a bear trap as the price could go lower. Daily resistance for the LTC price – $70. Daily support for the LTC price – $60. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prediction: Is the Recovery Just Getting Started?

4405590,https://newsbtc.com/?p=509101,1668748751,Ep07- Moneyland – Companion Guide For BBC’s “The Missing Cryptoqueen” Podcast,"What’s Moneyland? That’s what the first half of this “The Missing Cryptoqueen” episode is about. The second part is about Frankfurt, the city where Jamie and Georgia think that Dr. Ruja might be hiding. In any case, Moneyland is that mythical place where the money that millionaires and corporate entities want to disappear goes. The concept comes from british journalist Oliver Bullough, who “has spent many years investigating the ways illicit money flows around the world, including in Eastern Europe.” He’s this episode’s star guest. Related Reading: AGCM Bans OneCoin’s Alleged Pyramid Scheme Activities in Italy The Frankfurt part, however, is the most exciting segment of the whole podcast so far. The production team really stepped up their investigative game and got closer to Dr. Ruja than any police department ever will. We know our summaries are phenomenal, but we recommend that everyone listens to that second part at least. Remember, you can download episodes directly from the BBC, or listen to “The Missing Cryptoqueen” through Apple, Spotify, or iVoox. In any case, let’s go to Moneyland! About “The Missing Cryptoqueen,” Episode Seven – “In Plain Sight” Is Dr. Ruja alive? Before even mentioning Moneyland, producer Georgia Catt confirms a possible Dr. Ruja sighting to presenter Jamie Bartlett. The staff of an Athens restaurant remembers someone with Dr. Ruja’s characteristics as part of a party of six. What they’re not sure about is exactly *when* did this happen. Interesting. The possibility of a Dr. Ruja running around Europe might’ve been the catalyst for the Frankfurt part of the episode. But first, let’s get to Moneyland. After hearing the basic facts of the OneCoin case, journalist Oliver Bullough tells Jamie that once upon a time “Albania descended into anarchy because of a pyramid scheme.” As the crypto world has confirmed lately, these scams can be dangerous. Then, Bullough explains what Moneyland is. Rich and smart people can construct their “assets in such a way that they become invisible.” They can still use them to “buy political influence and nice houses and yachts.” When it comes to other people trying to find those assets, though, they turn invisible. So, “that’s what Moneyland is, Moneyland is the place where these assets go.” This breaks Jamie, who asks if there’s zero chance of finding them. Bullough tries to cheer him up by saying “It’s not zero chance. It’s, yeah. I mean, it’s been very well hidden, right?” And that’s not the most depressing part of the episode. After that, they inform us that the UK has stopped their investigation into OneCoin. They just gave up. FTT price chart for 11/18/2022 on FTX | Source: FTT/USD on TradingView.com Moneyland Leads To Frankfurt When things look darker, “The Missing Cryptoqueen’s” production team gets into high gear. They turn their investigating arm up a few notches and focus on the Internet. “We put so much online now, and that information can betray us. And that’s what took us to somewhere we think Dr. Ruja might be.“ That somewhere is Frankfurt. Our heroes determine that Dr. Ruja’s ex-husband and her hidden daughter live in the city. Plus, her best friend seems to have visited Frankfurt recently. They get there and they find nothing, not a single trace. This part is excruciating. However, it leads Jamie and Georgia to a high-luxury neighborhood that feels like the place Dr. Ruja would live. This is where Monelyland leads to. In there, they find a charismatic but annoying postman that might remember the name Ignatova. They leave that storyline open and “The Missing Cryptoqueen” returns to England. To finish the episode off, Jamie has a very interesting discussion with Cameron, “a UK-based OneCoin promoter.” Is he a true believer or is he just defending an extremely lucrative business? Cameron goes all in and carries the OneCoin party line to the very end. Wow. This might be the most surprising part of the whole episode. Quotes From Episode Seven of “The Missing Cryptoqueen”: Oliver Bullough, explaining how money can disappear: “If you are rich enough and well advised enough or clever enough, you construct your assets in such a way that they become invisible. They still exist, you can still use them to buy things, you can still use them to buy political influence and nice houses and yachts. But when it comes from someone trying to find them, whether that’s a journalist or a police officer, the assets are invisible. And so that’s what Moneyland is, Moneyland is the place where these assets go.” Jamie Barlett on what led them to Frankfurt: “There’s one place we haven’t looked, not really looked. And it’s probably the most obvious place of all, the Internet. We put so much online now, and that information can betray us. And that’s what took us to somewhere we think Dr. Ruja might be. Not Athens, Frankfurt. It took weeks of extremely boring internet research and painstakingly going back through everything we’ve learned so far.” Extra Material, about “Moneyland”: In The Guardian’s review of Oliver Bullough’s “Moneyland,” they quote a metaphorical definition of the novel term: “He conceives of it as a secret, parallel world, almost like something from a fairytale: “The very wealthiest people … have tunnelled into this new land that lies beneath all our nation states, where borders have vanished. They move their money … and themselves wherever they wish, picking and choosing which countries’ laws they wish to live by.” Related Reading: Vietnamese Government Confirms OneCoin’s “License” is a Fake The Guardian also says: “He is surprisingly successful at getting some of the architects of the offshore world to open up, and is sensitive to the fact that some of its users have good reason to avoid governments, such as rich dissidents fearing the politically motivated confiscation of their assets. He also accepts an argument frequently put to him in notorious tax havens: that wealthier, less criticised countries such as Britain have been equally involved in building and maintaining Moneyland.” Episode Credits Presenter: Jamie Bartlett Producer: Georgia Catt Story consultant: Chris Berube Editor: Philip Sellars Original music and sound design: Phil Channell Original music and vocals: Dessislava Stefanova and the London Bulgarian Choir Previous Companion Guides For BBC’s “The Missing Cryptoqueen” Podcast: Ep. 01 – https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/ep01-dr-ruja-companion-guide-for-bbcs-the-missing-cryptoqueen-podcast/ Ep. 02 – https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/ep02-btc-killer-companion-guide-for-bbcs-the-missing-cryptoqueen-podcast/ Ep. 03 – https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/ep03-onecoin-companion-guide-for-bbcs-the-missing-cryptoqueen-podcast/ Ep. 04 – https://www.newsbtc.com/scams-and-fraud/ep04-onelife-companion-guide-for-bbcs-the-missing-cryptoqueen-podcast/ Ep. 05 – https://www.newsbtc.com/scams-and-fraud/ep05-mlm-companion-guide-for-bbcs-the-missing-cryptoqueen-podcast/ Ep. 06 – https://www.newsbtc.com/scams-and-fraud/ep06-dealshaker-companion-guide-for-bbcs-the-missing-cryptoqueen-podcast/ Featured Image: The Missing Cryptoqueen's logo, from the BBC | Charts by TradingView",NEUTRAL,FTT,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | RESEARCH | FTT,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://newsbtc.com/scams-and-fraud/ep07-moneyland-companion-guide-for-bbcs-the-missing-cryptoqueen-podcast/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

The cryptocurrency, ranking 32nd in terms of market capitalization, seems to have recovered a bit after the broader market experienced a severe slump triggered by the collapse of FTX which used to be the third largest exchange platform in the world. According to tracking from Coingecko, over the last seven days, Quant managed to jump by 7.7% and has so far trimmed its 30-day losses to just 44%. At the time of this writing, the digital asset is changing hands at $115.85. The steady performance of the altcoin despite the multiple occurrence of bearish cycles in the market over the last few months seem to have sparked greater interest for it as evidenced by the sudden but impressive increase in addresses that hold the crypto asset. Related Reading: Why Ethereum Top Whales Are Accumulating ETH In ‘Abnormal’ Way Image: Invezz A Decent Growth For Quant Some experts believe that one of the best ways to measure the growth of a crypto network is the number of addresses that hold a particular cryptocurrency. Quant notched an important milestone in that department as it successfully added 13,000 wallets in just a span of seven days. This is the biggest number that was tallied by QNT on a weekly basis. It is also important to note that over the last 236 weeks, the crypto’s network recorded 77,000 addresses that were holding the digital currency. QNT wallets surpassed 90,000 in number last week, following the largest weekly increase in address count. ⚡️ 90K❗️⚡️ $QNT 𝐅𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭 𝟐𝟑𝟔 𝐰𝐞𝐞𝐤𝐬: 77,000 wallets 𝐋𝐚𝐬𝐭 𝟏 𝐰𝐞𝐞𝐤: 13,000 wallets Something is happening. 🔥 pic.twitter.com/tlpxTbHMOP — Greg Lunt 🌐 (@GregLunt27) November 14, 2022 Because this sudden spike happened during the same time when the crypto market crashed because of the unfortunate series of events that led to the implosion of the FTX platform, some experts believe there was significant influx of Quant tokens from various exchanges. QNT Flexes Its Long-Term Muscle Even with the positive development, it can’t be denied that QNT also took a hit when the entire market collectively declined and all crypto assets experienced severe price dump. In fact, Quant nosedived all the way down to $94. However, the altcoin showcased a different level of resiliency as it held its support range steadily despite strong selling pressure. In doing so, it prevented itself from revisiting the $40 marker which is considered to be its year-to-date (YTD) low. Moreover, for the past two days, the cryptocurrency was able to increase its value by more than 30%, confirming the narrative of a strong accumulation phase that led to the sudden uptick in number of addresses holding it.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Bitcoin Ignores the Chaos for Another Day  By James Rubin  Did the emperor ever have clothes?  New FTX CEO John J. Ray had some thoughts on his predecessor, the embattled crypto exchange's founder Sam Bankman-Fried, in a Delaware court filing.  Ray, who helped preside over energy company Enron's high-profile bankruptcy two decades ago, brutally noted that FTX was less professionally run than a neighborhood lemonade stand.  ""Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here,"" Ray said in a court document filed on Thursday."" From compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad, to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals, this situation is unprecedented.""  Bitcoin took the news in stride, trading sideways for most of the day, even as additional revelations surfaced from documents connected to FTX's filing for bankruptcy protection. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was up 1.1% and changing hands easily over the $16,000 support it assumed nine days ago. Ether was changing hands just over its most recent $1,200 support, off roughly a half-percentage point. Other cryptos were flat, some a bit green and others in the red, although Voyager Digital's VGX token soared more than 48% after CoinDesk's scoopmeister Ian Allison reported that crypto exchange Binance was preparing a bid for the bankrupt lending platform.  Equity markets remained largely oblivious to crypto’s cascading crises with the tech-heavy Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average all falling a few fractions of a percentage point. Stocks and cryptos correlation on Thursday offered a veering from recent weeks when the two asset classes showed increasing independence from one another.  In an email to CoinDesk, Jon Campagna, head of trading and capital markets at crypto investment fund CoinFund, said he was ""embarrassed"" and ""saddened"" by FTX's collapse. One of CoinFund's funds made a small equity investment in FTX, Campagna said.  ""I have a burning rage I can’t quite extinguish,"" he wrote. ""It hurt to look at the faces of my teammates and partners this week and last. To look at the faces of my competitors and peers as we tried to help each other navigate the turmoil.""  Campagna noted one company founder who worked 20 hours a day for two years who kept his company's treasury, from which he paid his employees, on FTX – and it was now gone, along with his ability to pay his employees.""  ""Seeing these faces and hearing these stories filled me with sadness and rage. Sadness that I could've done more to prevent these types of outcomes and rage at the petulant children that created this particular mess. I think the market is reflecting its participants feeling similar sentiments to mine.""  But he added: ""This will pass. And we will build back better and stronger.""

Ray III, who was brought in to oversee Enron’s high-profile bankruptcy in 2001, didn’t hold back in his appraisal of FTX and its then-CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried.  ""Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here,"" Ray wrote in a filing to Delaware court. ""From compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad, to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals, this situation is unprecedented.""  Ray’s brutal comments offered a stunning rebuke to venture capitalists who invested tens of millions of dollars in FTX after allegedly performing the most exacting due diligence, and others who treated Sam Bankman-Fried and his crypto exchange as white knights in an industry filled with scoundrels.  Here are some highlights from Ray’s report:  “In the Bahamas, corporate funds of the FTX Group were used to purchase homes and other personal items for employees and advisors. There’s no documentation of these transactions as loans, and real estate was recorded in the personal name of these employees and advisors on the records of the Bahamas.”  “The FTX Group’s approach to human resources combined employees of various entities and outside contractors with unclear records and lines of responsibility.”  “The main companies in the Alameda Silo and the Ventures Silo did not keep complete books and records of their investments and activities.”  Now, let’s contrast this with recent statements from venture capitalists who, because of the irresponsibilities at FTX, have now written down their investments to zero.  From Temasek, Singapore’s state-owned venture capital fund:  Similar to all investments, we conducted an extensive due diligence process on FTX, which took approximately eight months from February to October 2021. During this time, we reviewed FTX’s audited financial statement, which showed it to be profitable.  And here’s what Sequoia had to say:  We do not take this responsibility lightly and do extensive research and thorough due diligence on every investment we make. At the time of our investment in FTX, we ran a rigorous diligence process.  But what exactly did these firms do during the due diligence process?  Is it that Bankman-Fried and friends were able to construct a Potemkin village and show investors an alternate reality? Or is it just that his cult of personality is so great that the siren song of promised returns distracted these professionals from their work?  Regardless, Ray and his team have uncovered more holes in a week than companies who explore investments for a living found in months of research.  Through poor accounting, corporate loopholes and other accounting methods, Enron cloaked billions of dollars in debt. Its bankruptcy at the time was the largest in U.S. history.  Notably, Ray led shareholder lawsuits against banks that worked with Enron’s leadership to help prop up its ruse. Eleven banks paid Enron’s creditors around $3.4 billion; Citi paid nearly $1.7 billion. Banks, after all, were part of the problem with Enron. They created, and enabled, the Potemkin village of Enron’s financial vehicles.  Substitute venture capitalists for banks, and the story sounds familiar.

42388614,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRPERP,1668734969,Bahamas Securities Regulator Says It Ordered FTX Crypto Transferred to Government Wallets,"The Securities Commission of the Bahamas announced Thursday that it ordered the contents of FTX's crypto wallets to be transferred to government-controlled wallets on the previous Saturday.  In a press release, the commission said it made the order under existing authorities that allow for it to take action if it needs to protect clients or their funds.  ""The Securities Commission of The Bahamas ('the Commission'), in the exercise of its powers as regulator acting under the authority of an Order made by the Supreme Court of The Bahamas, took the action of directing the transfer of all digital assets of FTX Digital Markets Ltd. ('FDM') to a digital wallet controlled by the Commission, for safekeeping,"" the release said. ""Urgent interim regulatory action was necessary to protect the interests of clients and creditors of FDM.""  It's unclear why the commission made the announcement five days after placing the order. It's also unclear whether and when exactly these transfers may have occurred. SCB Executive Director Christina Rolle did not answer a phone call.  FTX filed for bankruptcy protection on Friday, Nov. 11, in a chaotic filing which mistakenly labeled a number of companies not part of the FTX umbrella as also filing for bankruptcy. On the evening of Nov. 11 and into the early hours of Nov. 12, the company appeared to have been hacked, with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of crypto flowing out of FTX's wallets. Some of these transactions were tied to profane comments about former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.  FTX US General Counsel Ryne Miller tweeted at the time that he was investigating, before later saying FTX was working to divert some funds to cold storage wallets.  Read more: FTX Hacker Panicked, Still Holds $339M in Ether, Cryptos: Arkham Intelligence  The release may also be hinting towards a jurisdictional fight between the U.S. and the Bahamas, where FTX was headquartered. SCB's statement said, ""It is not the understanding of the Commission that FDM is a party to the U.S. Chapter 11 Bankruptcy proceedings.""  FTX Digital Markets filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. on Nov. 15, days after most of the rest of the FTX group made a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. Even odder, FTX Digital Markets filed its motion in the Southern District of New York, rather than in Delaware where the rest of the companies filed.  Attorneys for FTX said in a filing on Thursday that Bahamas court-appointed joint provisional liquidators made the filing, which recognizes foreign bankruptcies, as part of an effort to undermine the broader group's U.S. filings.  ""The filing of the Chapter 15 case without advance notice and in the SDNY is a blatant attempt to avoid the supervision of this Court and to keep FTX DM isolated from the administration of the rest of the Debtors, which constitute the vast majority of the remainder of the FTX group. Under normal circumstances, that would be inappropriate and grounds for transfer to this Court. But these are not normal circumstances,"" the attorneys said.  They went on to allege that Bankman-Fried was working with the Bahamas' government in this effort.  ""Mr. Bankman-Fried, the co-founder, and controlling owner of all of the Debtors and of FTX DM, appears to be supporting efforts by the JPLs to expand the scope of the FTX DM proceeding in the Bahamas, to undermine these Chapter 11 Cases, and to move assets from the Debtors to accounts in the Bahamas under the control of the Bahamian government,"" the filing said.  SCB will ""engage with other regulators and authorities"" in different jurisdictions in the coming days, its press release said.

RIOT noted that the expansion of its Whinstone facility as well as the new 1 GW facility in Texas is on track. We adjust our estimates based on the quarter end results and management’s commentary. We decrease our target price to $7.00, with an implied capital appreciation potential of 34%. We maintain our rating at Buy. Primary Risks Cryptocurrency mining is largely an unregulated activity; however, it will be a focus for increased regulation in the near- and long-term and the outcome of those regulations is uncertain. Failure to execute on expansion of its facilities. Investment Thesis Riot’s current operating footprint coupled with its planned expansions positions the firm as one of the leading cryptocurrency mining companies in North America. The expansion will increase Riot’s hash capacity to 12.5 EH/s by Q1:23, nearly 2x compared to current capacity which is likely to provide a significant boost to growth beginning 2023 and beyond. The Company has been working towards improving its cost structure as evident by the shift of miners from Coinmint’s facility to Riot’s own facilities in Texas. We believe RIOT offers a unique combination of growth and value within the cryptocurrency mining sector. Summary – Q3:22 Revenues down 28.6% vs. prior year. Q3:22 total revenues declined by 28.6% to $46.3 million as compared to $64.8 million in Q3:21 and were down sequentially versus $72.9 million in Q2:22. The revenue decline was attributed to lower Bitcoin production and decreases in the price of Bitcoin. Mining and Hosting registered declines of 59% and 25%, respectively. Mining segment revenues down 59% YOY to $22.0 million versus prior year revenues of $53.5 million. The increase was due to a lower number of Bitcoins mined (1,042 in Q3:22 vs. 1,292 in Q3:21), partially offset by a 28% drop in Bitcoin price ($21,184 in Q2:22 vs. $41,837 in Q3:21). The decline in the Bitcoin price resulted in lower mining segment margins (61.2% in Q3:22 versus 75.7% in Q3:21). Hashrate capacity up 27% YOY. As of September 30, 2022, the Mining business operated 55,728 miners, with a hash rate capacity of 5.6 exahash per second (EH/s), representing growth of 27% as compared to Q3:21. RIOT anticipates 115,450 miners in operation with a hash rate capacity of 12.5 EH/s by Q1:23. Net loss of $36.6 million , compared to a net loss of $15.3 million in Q3:21. Net loss for Q3:22 was negatively impacted by impairment on Bitcoin, and a decrease in the fair value of power derivative assets. Adjusted EBITDA was $0.2 million during Q3:22 , compared to adjusted EBITDA income of $37.5 million in Q3:21. Strong financial position with $369.8 million in working capital, including $255.0 million in cash on hand, and 6,766 Bitcoin. Bitcoins held on the balance sheet were up 39% compared to 4,884 BTC at the end of Q4:21. Capacity expansion on track. RIOT made substantial progress on the 400 MW expansion at Whinstone. The expansion is expected to be completed in Q1:23. Additionally, the development of a 265-acre 1 GW expansion in Navarro County, Texas which began in Q2:22 is progressing well. The first phase of the expansion comprises 400 MW of Bitcoin mining infrastructure. The mining operations at this facility are expected to commence in Q4:23. Valuation and Recommendation We value RIOT using industry peer companies (a P/S multiple) blended with our Discounted Cash Flow valuation to derive a fair value target price for the Company. We value RIOT using a P/S multiple. We use publicly traded cryptocurrency mining companies as its peers. We value RIOT at 2.5x 2024 sales and then discount that result back at our computed cost of capital. Our multiple is at a premium to the peer group average given RIOT’s position as one of the largest publicly listed Bitcoin mining company in North America. The multiple based target price is $6.64, which discounts back to the present value of $5.99. We weight the other 50% of our target using our Discounted Cash Flow target. Our DCF model uses our forecasted free cash flow to the firm over the next three years and then grows EBIT at a 20% rate over years four and five, 15% over years six and seven, 10% over year eight and 3% thereafter. We apply a weighted average cost of capital of 10.88%. Our DCF produces a value of $7.73. The combination of $5.99 at 50% and $7.73 at 50% results in a weighted average price target of $7.00. The exhibit below summarizes our peer group multiples, while the DCF is included at the end of this report.
