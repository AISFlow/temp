42386618,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBU9IJ,1619642150,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Stays Near $55K as Ether Hits Brand-New Record Price,"The story of boring bitcoin and exciting ether continued in the cryptocurrency markets Wednesday.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $54,925 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 0.14% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $54,046-$55,710 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC above the 10-hour and the 50-hour moving averages on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price was holding steady on Wednesday, showing little change over the past 24 hours. At around 02:30 UTC (9 p.m. ET Tuesday), the world’s largest cryptocurrency went as high as $55,710. It then lost steam and returned to the $54,000 level but was at $54,925 as of press time.      Over-the-counter crypto trader Alessandro Andreotti says bitcoin’s stagnant market is due to investors continuing to explore other cryptocurrencies. ”Bitcoin has, in fact, gone up, but I see it as a consolidation move to a new price range,” Andreotti said. “It's staying relatively stable right now while alts moon.”      Alternative cryptocurrencies, or “alts,” are certainly shining. Bitcoin’s dominance, a measure of its share of cryptocurrency market capitalization, has dropped over 16% to 50.45% since the start of April, according to calculations by charting provider TradingView.      “You can see bitcoin dominance has been steadily decreasing over the last day and week,” added Andreotti. “Overall, the crypto market is behaving in a very similar way to the 2017 run. If it keeps doing that, we can expect a new run for bitcoin in the short to mid term, possibly a new all-time high even, while alts consolidate at their new price ranges.”      In the derivatives space, open interest in bitcoin futures across major venues is way down so far this week. Last week, the total open interest hit $523 billion. So far this week, that number is a paltry $124 billion, according to data aggregator Skew.      As the bitcoin boredom continues, the crypto ecosystem has excitement in the form of ether and decentralized finance, or DeFi, according to Rich Rosenblum, president of cryptocurrency market maker GSR.      “As the space matures, we'll see more dispersion,” Rosenblum told CoinDesk. “BTC is increasingly a proxy for traditional finance coming to the space via regulated platforms, while ether is more of the crypto natives buying ETH directly or indirectly as a result of DeFi.”      David Streltsoff, chief revenue officer for quantitative trading firm Efficient Frontier, says the lack of BTC market action might simply be newer investors looking elsewhere for quick profits given the low returns bitcoin is putting out. “I don't think bitcoin has lost its luster,” Streltsoff said. “Investors, at least in retail, are looking for the next DOGE and a mere 20% isn't good enough anymore.”      Read More: Bitcoin’s Recovery Rally Stalls as Fed Meeting Draws to a Close      Bitcoin is down over 6% so far in April, according to spot data from Luxembourg-based exchange Bitstamp. “BTC holding support of around $54,000 is positive,” Streltsoff added.    Ether price, fundamentals hitting new highs    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Wednesday, trading around $2,723 and climbing 3.9% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET). ETH has hit a new all-time high, with the record now standing at $2,743, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      The highest day for ether spot volumes in 2021 occurred last week, hitting $68 billion across major exchanges April 23, according to CoinDesk Research data. Bitcoin’s volumes that day were $88 billion, signalling ether is gaining some momentum on the world’s oldest cryptocurrency.      Total value locked in the Ethereum ecosystem has crossed $64 billion for the first time, a fresh high as investors plow more money into DeFi.      “Ether prices follow total value locked,” said GSR’s Rosenblum. “ETH is much more correlated to DeFi even though BTC is technically DeFi, too.” As of press time, 9.9 million ETH is locked in DeFi, worth over $27.1 billion. Meanwhile, 155,748 BTC, worth $8.5 billion, is parked in various DeFi apps.      Neil Van Huis, director of institutional trading for crypto liquidity provider Blockfills, says ether’s infrastructure is a key reason traders are steadfastly interested in buying ether over bitcoin for the time being.      “I just think the overall landscape for ether has improved greatly,” Van Huis told CoinDesk. The Ethereum blockchain ""shook off the [initial coin offering] boom and bust, went through several bull/bear markets and the infrastructure has finally been laid for ETH to do what it was, hopefully, intended to do.”      Read More: Bumper, a DeFi-Based Crypto Volatility Protection Plan, Raises $10M    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mixed Wednesday.

In an announcement Wednesday, BaFin said the Binance stock tokens tracking the movement of shares in Tesla, Coinbase and MicroStrategy have been identified as “suspicious” and require a prospectus that wasn't issued prior to trading.  BaFin said the cryptocurrency exchange has violated the prospectus obligation under Article 3 Paragraph 1 of the European Prospectus Regulation.  According to BaFin, the violation of the prospectus constitutes an administrative offense and can be punished with a fine of up to €5 million ($6 million) or 3% of Binance’s annual revenue.  Elsewhere red flags have already been raised by Hong Kong law firms regarding the Binance stock tokens launched earlier this month.  On April 22, the Financial Times reported that U.K.'s regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, is “working with the firm [Binance] to understand the product, the regulations that may apply to it and how it is marketed.”  The stock tokens allow Binance customers to purchase as little as one-hundredth of a regular share using Binance USD (BUSD), a U.S. dollar stablecoin issued by the exchange.

""Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. The sectors most adversely affected by the [coronavirus] pandemic remain weak but have shown improvement,"" according to the Fed's statement.      ""Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses,"" the U.S. central bank said.      The decision concluded a two-day, closed-door meeting by the Fed's monetary-policy panel, known as Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC.    The Fed said employment “strengthened,” a change from the last statement where the central bank characterized the labor market as having “turned up.”  Officials noted that “the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak but have shown improvement,” also a change from the prior meeting’s statement.  “Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors.”  “It will take some time before we see substantial further progress,"" said Fed Chief Jerome Powell during a press conference conducted shortly after the Fed's policy announcement. Powell said the economy is unlikely to see inflation go higher because of the continued slack in the labor market.    Central bank policy is particularly important to cryptocurrency investors who believe bitcoin (BTC) is a hedge against inflation and currency debasement.      The Fed has doubled the size of its balance sheet to nearly $8 trillion since the start of 2020, flooding financial markets with freshly created money to support the economy and markets as the coronavirus took a devastating toll on business activity and consumer confidence.

The attacker took advantage of a vulnerability that has been present in Uranium's v2 contracts since the exchange upgraded over a week ago. After sending the minimum required tokens into Uranium's ""pair contracts,"" the attacker drained the liquidity pools for multiple token pairs; a misplaced zero in the contract's balance field (or rather, the lack of one in a section that manages reserves) created the opening for the attack vector.      Out of the $50 million filched, pools for Binance's blockchain token (BNB) and its stablecoin (BUSD) each lost $18 million in funds. Ethereum and BTCB pools (Binance Chain's version of ""wrapped'' bitcoin) collectively lost around $9 million worth of tokens. An additional $6.7 million in USDT and $1.7 million in DOT, ADA and Uranium's own token also disappeared from other pools.    Read more: SushiSwap, Fleeing Ethereum Fees, Is Now Live on Binance Smart Chain, Fantom, Others    Post-hack, the BTCB has been swapped for real BTC, and the ETH is in an Ethereum mixer called Tornado Cash, according to The Block researcher Igor Igamberdiev.      Notably, per a past exploit on Binance's BSC blockchain, the BNB and BUSD could be recovered through a rollback, though Binance has made no announcements on the matter.    'Whole farm at risk'    This vulnerability is present in all Uranium v2 pools. A Telegram pinned message by anonymous Uranium community member Baymax warns users to ""STOP adding liquidity ... and remove liquidity if you can"" because the exploit still leaves millions of dollars in tokens at risk in these v2 contracts.      Baymax advises users to migrate to the v2.1 contracts, which include a fix for the vulnerability. Notably, the attack came two hours before v2.1 went live, even though the exploit had been open since Uranium's last upgrade to v2 just over a week ago.

Outside of Uranium would be the 3 auditors contractors and their respective sub cons who may be aware of this flaw,"" it reads farther down. Later in the message, Baymax hypothesizes that ""someone leaked information"" that lead to the attacker exploiting the vulnerability.

42386609,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBU95j,1619625667,The Node: Opening the Mental Health Closet,"Reinventing money, the financial system, the internet and the enterprise is fun. But sometimes the workload can take its toll.      I was reminded of that yesterday reading Dan Kuhn’s interview with Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of Polygon, a hot Ethereum-scaling startup. Nailwal, who lives in India, described a grueling routine of 16 or 17 calls a day, little sleep and no vacation, even for Christmas.      “My life is always spending. Personal life gets affected a lot. And this is not only for me,” he said. “Everybody who is doing anything significant in crypto is going through the same situation.”    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    To crypto outsiders, the response to this may be some version of cry me a river. Polygon’s own token, matic, is up 35-fold this year. And anyone who invested in bitcoin (BTC) more than a few weeks ago is sitting on impressive gains, perhaps even life-changing fortunes. A little hard work is worth it.      But there are reasons why working in crypto comes with special strains and why Nailwal says, “There will be studies on mental health on the people in crypto.” The market is 24/7. Volatility is baked in. And any successful project has lots of stakeholders who need looking after. That’s the nature of these decentralized, commonly owned, commonly governed initiatives.      Nailwal spoke of running a startup that faces the scrutiny of a listed company.      “When you are building your own token startup, basically you are a public company, you have similar obligations as being a public company because everything is on view. Plus, you have to handle all of the pressure of being a startup. You have to build your product, find your customers and all that. The pressure is multifold.      ""You are working in the finance industry and you are working in a startup – both are extremely excruciating things, but together in one job. It has been very taxing. On a personal level and professional level I feel like I have aged a lot.”      Marc Hochstein and I recently interviewed a psychotherapist in Southern California about crypto’s hidden mental health issues (full write-up coming soon). She has several clients who are at their wits' end, unable to cope with the dual challenges of pandemic work and an always-on industry.      “This is really different. If you are in middle management in any other industry, you're not experiencing so many highs and lows. It's very intensely stressful yet exciting. But because it's new, we still don't even know what the impacts of mental health are on for those individuals in this industry.”      There’s a lot more to say here. But, for now, the takeaways are these:      One, look after yourself. Jeff Wilser wrote an easy 15-point guide to staying sane while trading crypto here.      Two, look out for your work colleagues; they may be less happy than their emojis and Slack comments suggest.      And three, if you are a manager, think about ways to offer extra help and time off, and even in-house counseling. The therapist we spoke to said the crypto industry can lead the way on mental health in the workplace, ending stigmas for good.      “In my opinion, I think the whole stigma to mental health is kind of disappearing,"" she said. ""And I'm hoping that, with the new crypto industry, mental health can grow with it.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MATIC,Benjamin Schiller,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/28/the-node-opening-the-mental-health-closet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/674674b1ab6a325a879dacfbd31074e2f626f3bf-1440x712.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386605,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBU91x,1619625044,Serum Token Becomes Latest Project in Bankman-Fried Empire to Turn Heads,"Cryptocurrency traders were agog last August when prices for the digital token serum (SRM) jumped 10-fold on its first day of trading after being listed on Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume.      But another 10-fold increase since then is sparking a new wave of speculation among digital-market analysts over the token’s future – apparently tied to the growing popularity of the affiliated decentralized exchange Serum, which is built on top of the Solana blockchain, and championed by Sam Bankman-Fried of the FTX crypto exchange and Alameda Research trading firm.      Prices for the SRM token shot up Tuesday to an all-time high of $11.13, according to the data firm Messari. The market capitalization now sits around $500 million, well below the $22 billion for the leading decentralized exchange Uniswap’s UNI token but still enough to turn heads. As of press time, SRM was changing hands at around $9.27.      Some analysts have attributed the recent success of the Serum project and Solana blockchain to their association with Bankman-Fried, who garnered headlines recently for his $135 million deal to name the basketball team Miami Heat’s home arena after the FTX exchange. According to a blog post last July, FTX and Alameda support Serum and choose Solana as its foundational blockchain.      “Traders perhaps saw Alameda Research-related names as safe havens” during last week’s crypto-market sell-off, said Mira Christanto, a research analyst at Messari.      Bankman-Fried, who serves as CEO of FTX, told CoinDesk in a LinkedIn chat that he isn’t sure why serum has surged this week in particular, but he said it was “probably” following Solana’s SOL tokens, which have climbed 24-fold this year, for a market value of between $12 billion and $22 billion, depending on how it’s calculated.      Earlier this month, Alameda Research led investors in a $2 million fundraising round for Step Finance, a trading dashboard born out of a Solana-focused hackathon. The Solana Foundation, which supports development on the Solana blockchain, received $40 million in fresh funding in March.      A key talking point on Serum is that it provides a user experience similar to what traders see on big centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. That could make the project more attractive to traders who seek transactions that are faster and cheaper but also easier to use when compared with other decentralized exchanges, such as PancakeSwap on the Binance-backed blockchain Binance Smart Chain.      PancakeSwap has received criticism for being a copycat of Uniswap, which sits atop the Ethereum blockchain.      “Serum is very different from Ethereum-based DEXs because it built a central limit order book (CLOB), which is what you would typically see in centralized exchanges,” Christanto said. “This isn't possible on Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain, where automated market makers (AMMs) are more popular.”      A central limit order book is possible on Solana partly because of its high scalability, supporting 50,000 transactions per second (tps). On Binance Smart Chain, the maximum is 300 tps. On Ethereum, it's 18 tps.      “Solana isn't as fast as centralized exchanges, like FTX, but it is the first decentralized exchange to be able to provide a CLOB,” Christanto said.      Read More:PancakeSwap, Uniswap, SushiSwap and More: What to Consider When Parking Crypto in a DeFi Exchange      Danny Kim, head of revenue at crypto prime dealer SFOX, said serum's recent price gains may also be the result of excitement over Step Finance, which offers up to 3,500% annual percentage rate (APR) on deposits of its STEP tokens. All asset pools, liquidity and swaps on Step Finance are routed via Serum, according to Step Finance's website.      As Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of Solana Labs, wrote in a post on Medium, if the first phase of decentralized finance – DeFi 1.0 as it were – was focused on innovation in money markets, including lending and borrowing, then DeFi 2.0, as powered by Serum, would bring “high-speed trading and derivatives.”      ""Solana has become a protocol for traders, with a number of projects being built to focus on what traders and investors will need in DeFi,” SFOX's Kim said. “Fast, secure and scalable.""      Automated market makers “have grown in popularity on Ethereum primarily because they make it easy for yield and risk-insensitive asset owners to provide liquidity to the market,” Yakovenko wrote. “However, that doesn’t mean that AMMs are the optimal mechanism to provide liquidity. AMMs are obviously lacking in many dimensions. Most notably, capital efficiency.”      It’s still wait-and-see whether Serum will eventually pose any real threats to popular DEXs on Ethereum and BSC. Data from CoinGecko shows that Serum has about $52 million in daily trading volume, while on Ethereum-based Uniswap, the 24-hour trading volume was at more than $1.3 billion at press time, according to Dune Analytics.",POSITIVE,SOL,ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/28/serum-token-becomes-latest-project-in-bankman-fried-empire-to-turn-heads,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c6ffe78f6a9072e711bc4735d699015f4bfad10a-1300x817.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The securities regulator announced Wednesday it was designating a longer deliberative period for the bitcoin ETF application, saying it needed to ensure it has “sufficient time” to evaluate the proposal. There are 10 active bitcoin ETF applications, including VanEck's, and the agency is currently looking at three of them.  A bitcoin ETF could be key for mainstream adoption because it would be a regulated product allowing financial institutions and retail traders to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency without having to invest in it directly.  “The Commission designates June 17, 2021, as the date by which the Commission shall either approve or disapprove, or institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove, the proposed rule change,” states the filing, signed by Assistant Secretary J. Matthew DeLesDernier.  The SEC can take up to 240 days to determine whether it will approve or disapprove the ETF application. To date the agency has taken the full 240 days for most of the bitcoin ETF applications it has considered, and then rejected every application.  Proponents believe 2021 may finally be the year a bitcoin ETF is approved in the U.S., citing the launch of several such products in Canada and the recent confirmation of apparently crypto-friendly regulator Gary Gensler as the chair of the SEC.  VanEck filed its ETF proposal at the end of 2020, with Cboe BZX filing a 19b-4 form formally announcing its intention to act as VanEck’s exchange partner earlier this year.

42386611,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBU98F,1619622027,"Bumper, a DeFi-Based Crypto Volatility Protection Plan, Raises $10M","Bumper, a kind of insurance policy against cryptocurrency’s roller-coaster volatility borrowing techniques used in decentralized finance (DeFi), has raised $10 million from Alphabit, Autonomy, Beachhead, ChainLayer and others in a private token sale.      The wild frontiers of the cryptocurrency space, such as DeFi, are where all sorts of innovations spring up. For example, stablecoins, now a cornerstone of crypto, originally catered to firms beset by a lack of banking services. More recently, the DeFi realm has given birth to decentralized alternatives to traditional insurance.      Following this trend, Bumper allows users to protect the value of a crypto asset (starting with Ethereum’s native token, ETH) by setting a price floor for that asset with a guarantee it can be redeemed at that price.      For example, $100 worth of ETH with 90% of its value guaranteed would mean a $90 price floor protection. So if the price of ETH drops and those assets reach $80, say, the user can still withdraw $90 in the form of USDC stablecoin, explained Gareth Ward, chief operating officer of INDX Capital, the firm behind the Bumper protocol.    Read more: Insurance Alternative Nexus Mutual Follows DeFi Activity to Polkadot, Cosmos, Binance Smart Chain    For this protection the user would pay a nominal premium, as low as 3% per annum, according to Ward.      “Firstly, we tried to target pinch points in the DeFi sector and what we saw as quite large over-collateralization that's required in a lot of lending and borrowing,” Ward said in an interview. “What came out of this was the more fundamental issue of price volatility. Using aspects of DeFi, we’ve solved for this in a unique and decentralized way.”      Under the hood, Bumper operates an asset pool where liquidity providers (“makers”) earn a yield for adding USDC stablecoins. Bumper’s pool of USDC is used to swap in and out of the policyholders’ ETH, preventing the latter from falling below an unacceptable level. As well as the automated balancing act performed by the protocol, a separate risk pool covers any realized losses.    Read more: For the Daring but Lazy, a New DeFi Product Simplifies Leveraged ETH Bets    From June 8, liquidity providers will be able to deposit USDC and earn a yield along with a daily distribution of BUMP tokens, said Ward. The protocol will go fully live in August with a public token sale.      “You can't get away from risk in any marketplace, especially not crypto,” said Ward. “But what we do is take that risk, hit it with a sledgehammer and break it into a million pieces. It’s then distributed through this clever DeFi mechanism and plugged up with a massive backstop. It’s only after all that when someone would take a haircut.”",POSITIVE,ETH | USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TRADING | USDC | TOKEN SALE,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/04/28/bumper-a-defi-based-crypto-volatility-protection-plan-raises-10m,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/10647c6c82d1c15597aa1787cd942a104071f3f3-1500x1055.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42386608,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBU93D,1619621804,Ether Soars to New All-Time High and JPMorgan Notices,"Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, soared Wednesday to a new all-time high near $2,700, at the time of writing. That has inspired traditional Wall Street firms to provide investment-research coverage.      JPMorgan, in a report Tuesday titled “Why is ETH outperforming?”, suggests the cryptocurrency's valuations may be less dependent on demand from leveraged traders than for bitcoin (BTC). That might provide an important tailwind.    “Both BTC and ETH markets experienced comparable liquidity shocks earlier this month, which triggered a comparable de-leveraging of their respective derivatives markets in subsequent days,"" according to the JPMorgan analysts.  However, ether's spot-market depth has recovered quicker than bitcoin's, according to JPMorgan. “Open interest data also suggests that the other side of these trades were easier to source,” suggesting better liquidity conditions in ETH futures relative to BTC futures.  “Higher turnover on the public ETH blockchain means a noticeably higher fraction of those tokens can be considered highly liquid, further blunting the impact of futures liquidations.”  The more resilient bid for ETH futures has allowed for a more rapid recovery in liquidity relative to BTC.  “In combination with the continued growth for DeFi and other components of the Ethereum-based economy, this suggests some technical but occasionally important bullish tailwinds versus bitcoin,"" wrote JPMorgan.

42386615,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBU9Fn,1619620614,Bitcoin's Recovery Rally Stalls as Fed Meeting Draws to a Close,"Bitcoin's (BTC) recovery rally has paused as the closely watched two-day Federal Reserve meeting wraps up Wednesday afternoon.      The leading cryptocurrency is trading back and forth in the $53,900 to $55,700 range, having charted an impressive bounce from roughly $48,000 over the previous two days.      The market is struggling to find direction, possibly due to caution ahead of the end of the Fed gathering. Investors will be waiting for the post-meeting statement and to see during the post-meeting press conference if Chairman Jerome Powell drops hints of an early scaling back of stimulus because of fears of mounting inflation.      Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis shows inflation expectations for the second half of the current decade reached a 30-month high of 2.25% on Tuesday. Inflation fears have also spread to the stock market and could soon translate into a higher consumer price index, as per a new report from Bank of America.      Bitcoin may face selling pressure if the Fed turns hawkish (inclined to raise rates) and signals an early tapering of stimulus. ""A tightening stance from the Fed might cause bitcoin to give away the weekly gains,"" Pankaj Balani, co-founder and CEO of the Singapore-based Delta Exchange, said.      The Fed has been buying $120 billion worth of bonds under its open-ended asset purchase program since March 2020 to thwart the coronavirus pandemic's negative impact on markets and the economy. The central bank's benchmark interest rate also stands at a record low of 0.25%.      Financial assets and bitcoin have been significant beneficiaries of this ultra-easy monetary policy. Hence hints of early reversal may bring about a correction in asset prices.      That said, analysts expect the Fed to maintain its easing (dovish) bias.      ""Rather than follow the lead of the Bank of Canada [BOC], which last week began cutting back on bond purchases and signaled a quicker time frame for the next interest rate increase, the Fed will most likely take an approach similar to the one the European Central Bank conveyed last Thursday. ""It will maintain the policy as is, remind markets that it is willing to do even more should downside risks materialize,"" Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, noted in his Bloomberg column.      LMAX Digital's Joel Kruger and Delta Exchange's Balani also foresee the Fed keeping its dovish stance intact. ""The Fed should continue with its accommodative stance despite transitory inflationary pressures,"" Balani said.      Recent weakness in the dollar index and Treasury yields also points to a low probability of the Fed following BOC's footsteps.      The dollar index, which gauges the greenback's value against major fiat currencies, has dropped by 2.3% this month despite signs the U.S. economy is accelerating. The 10-year Treasury yield has shed 12 basis points, according to data source TradingView.      Bitcoin's recovery rally may pick up steam if the Fed maintains its easy-money policy, as is expected. ""We don't believe there will be any messaging concerning an earlier taper, and we think bitcoin will continue to be supported in this backdrop,"" Kruger said.      Also read: As Powell Heads to Fed Meeting, Inflation Data Can Only Get Worse      However, Stack Funds' Matthew Dibb said he expects price consolidation even if the Fed maintains its current course. ""From a technical view, bitcoin is lagging in its recovery since last week, with the majority of alternative cryptocurrencies charting stronger rallies,"" Dibb said. ""We caution traders that we may be stuck in the $50,000 to $60,000 range for the next few weeks.""",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/28/bitcoins-recovery-rally-stalls-as-fed-meeting-draws-to-a-close,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/623d17ed8c49e10d16cd8d4f060a61fd9173ab9e-1400x788.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Alchemy’s ubiquitous infrastructure and developer platform has grown since its public launch eight months ago to reach a $505 million valuation, CEO Nikil Viswanathan said in an interview.      The round was co-led by Coatue Management, the tech investment manager led by hedge fund maven Philippe Laffont. Coatue also led a $305 million funding round in March for Dapper Labs, one of Alchemy’s customers.      Also involved in the Alchemy round was Addition, the $1.3 billion fund launched last year by tech investor Lee Fixel. Other notable participants include electro-pop duo The Chainsmokers and the Glazer family, who own the Manchester United soccer team and the National Football League’s Tampa Bay Buccaneers.      The funding round in Alchemy represents one of the larger blockchain infrastructure bets in recent memory.

Viswanathan and Joe Lau, both Forbes “30 Under 30” computer science graduates from Stanford, founded the company in 2017, and its technology was in beta testing until last August.      “Whenever you have a new industry, whether it's a computer or the internet or blockchain, you always need this developer platform layer,” Viswanathan said, adding:    “For the computer, that was your operating system, so your Windows and Mac OS; and for the internet, that was Amazon Web Services enabling people to build applications on top. Alchemy is driving that same change in the transformational blockchain space.”  Back-end boosters    Competitors include platforms such as ConsenSys-owned Infura and Truffle. Following the trend toward lower-fee and less-congested alternatives to Ethereum, Alchemy is working with Dapper Labs’ Flow blockchain and has “a bunch of other chains” to be announced in the coming weeks, Viswanathan said.      “On the multi-chain side, we've put in all this work over the last three years to grow the Ethereum developer ecosystem with developers tools and infrastructure,” Lau said in an interview. “Now other ecosystems are starting to think about their developers and are looking at what we’ve done and saying, ‘Hey, we want what you’ve done for Ethereum on our blockchain as well.’”      Jerry Yang, a founding partner at AME Cloud Ventures and a Yahoo co-founder who also invested in the round, added via email:    “Historically, the advancement of groundbreaking technologies have depended on developer platforms to unlock innovation.

Food giant Dole is partnering with David Datuna on a five-part NFT series dubbed “Taking a Bite Out of Hunger” that will be marketed by the fintech company Zytara and go on sale May 6 via the NFT marketplace Rarible. Proceeds from the auction will go to charity.      It’s the latest episode in a craze that continues to veer into the bizarre.      Many will recall back in 2019 when a single banana taped to a wall was sold to a private collector for a staggering amount at Art Basel Miami Beach. The pricy banana was then devoured by Datuna, which has earned him the nickname the Hungry Artist.      NFTs are cryptographic assets that can have variable features. So far, they have been used to represent a wide range of unique tangible and intangible items, from art to collectible sports cards to virtual real estate and even digital sneakers.

It really is only the very beginning of a brave new equalized crypto world for all,” said Datuna.    ‘Taking a Bite Out of Hunger’    Dole chose to work with the Hungry Artist on the NFT series because his perspective on art as a platform for societal change resonated with the firm, said Rupen Desai, Dole’s global CMO.      “This NFT series allows us to bring awareness to the global issue of food insecurity and hunger in a new and visually compelling way, converging all three,” Desai said in an email.

42386601,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBU8wv,1619615052,DeFi Pushes ETH Loans at Genesis to New Highs as BTC Rates Drop,"Ether has cannibalized bitcoin in Genesis’ loan book as more hedge funds borrow ETH to deploy into decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, the cryptocurrency lender reported in its Q1 results on Wednesday.      ETH loans at Genesis, which is owned by CoinDesk parent company Digital Currency Group, increased by 400% from $465 million in Q4 2020 to $2.4 billion in Q1. ETH now makes up 27% of the lender’s loan book, whereas its portion was just 15.5% of the loan book in Q4.      Meanwhile ETH locked in DeFi overall has increased from $15 billion to $60 billion, a 300% increase.      “It shows just how much institutions are taking DeFi seriously,” said Momin Ahmad, chief strategy officer at crypto credit data company Credmark. “It’s kind of hard in DeFi to figure out who’s doing what.”    Genesis as DeFi gateway    The lender originated 163% more loans in the first quarter than it did in the previous quarter. Its total loans outstanding now amount to $9 billion, a 136% increase from the $3.8 billion in loans outstanding the firm held in Q4.      Genesis did note a decrease in BTC lent out in Q1 compared to other quarters because traders have now lost the arbitrage opportunity of selling bitcoin at a premium in the public market after a vesting period in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which is now trading at a discount. (Grayscale is also owned by Digital Currency Group.)      In response to this “lackluster demand,” Genesis lowered its annual rates on borrowed BTC from depositors from 3% to 6% to between 1% to 3%.      “A small percentage of our overall loan portfolio was financing the GBTC premium arb,” said Matt Ballensweig, Genesis’ vice president of lending. “The trades we did finance were with some of our best and largest counterparties who posted collateral either in the form of cash, crypto, private placement shares or a mix of these.”      U.S. dollars (USD) and stablecoins maintained roughly a 21% share of the loan book because demand for cash has been “relentless,” Genesis said in its release.      The lender also described a “cash-deficit issue” as a reason for crypto-backed cash loan demand. This past month, Silvergate Bank reported a 52% increase in bitcoin-backed loans since last quarter, and Signature noted that bitcoin-backed loans would begin to show up in its earnings later in 2021.      “Genesis is actively looking to partner with banks such as Silvergate, Signature and investment banks to bring more cash to traders in the crypto market as yield opportunities on USD remain very attractive relative to other credit opportunities,” Ballensweig said.    Trades were ‘significant drivers of growth’    Genesis’ spot volume increased by 287% from $8.1 billion in Q4 to $31.5 billion in Q1, bolstered in part by Genesis Treasury, a new service at Genesis that helps corporates accumulate bitcoin through various strategies.      Derivatives trading increased by 133% to $10.5 billion in Q1.      “Although we grew our counterparty base by 21% over the quarter, our most significant drivers of growth were higher frequencies of trades and increased notional per trade from our crypto-native hedge fund client base,” Genesis said. “These clients were early adopters of our platform and were well positioned to take advantage of the [over-the-counter] liquidity we provided to take short-term, tactical bets in option format.”",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/28/defi-pushes-eth-loans-at-genesis-to-new-highs-as-btc-rates-drop,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ea558bd9dabc362648ad2633ba508c427cc5cbbe-2000x1333.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Miners responsible for generating the Shiba Inu-themed cryptocurrency may also be laughing their way to the bank.    The daily revenue of dogecoin miners rose to a record high of $3.6 million on April 26, marking a 4,575% rise from the New Year's day tally of $77,000, blockchain data provided by ByteTree shows.  Revenue estimates assume miners, who operate predominantly on cash, sell their coins immediately.  Miners receive newly created coins and transaction processing fees as a reward for mining blocks and processing transactions on the distributed ledger.  The price of dogecoin has rallied by 7,000% this year, sending miner revenue skywards.  The meme-based cryptocurrency reached a record high of 45 cents on April 18 and was last seen changing hands near 32 cents, up nearly 20% rise on a 24-hour basis.  Data provided by Coin Metrics shows a 60-fold increase in daily transaction fees this year alongside several brief spikes in the number of daily transactions.  However, transaction fees brought in just $23,200 or 0.64% of the total miner revenue of $3.6 million on April 26.  ""Transaction fees have risen, but price overwhelms,"" ByteTree CIO Charlie Morris said.  ""The market has been squeezed higher. I suspect many people who owned it a few years ago have forgotten, leading to tighter supply than perceived,"" Morris added.  Some observers fear the ongoing price rally is a bubble that can burst easily as 98 wallets are holding nearly 65% of all coins. Besides, the cryptocurrency is heavily influenced by Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk’s usually humorous tweets.  Bitcoin bull and CEO of Galaxy Digital Mike Novogratz recently called dogecoin's rally a sign of speculative retail frenzy.

42386617,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBU9H3,1619609400,"Valid Points: More Ethereum Upgrades to Come After Proof of Stake, Buterin Says","Pulse check: When a client goes down  Read more: Ethereum 2.0 Explained in 4 Easy Metrics    The Ethereum 2.0 network had its first major incident on Saturday, April 24. A bug was discovered in the software client, Prysm, that prevented roughly 70% of validators on the network from producing blocks.      As background, there are four main Eth 2.0 software clients: Prysm, Teku, Lighthouse and Nimbus. In order to become a validator and earn rewards on the network, a user must download and run one of these software clients on his or her computer device.      On Saturday, the Eth 2.0 software client Prysm failed to properly ingest data from the Ethereum blockchain and, as a result, caused all validators running the Prysm client to miss out on block rewards.      Prysmatic Labs, the developer team behind Prysm, tweeted that the incident caused about 15 ETH to be lost in total. On average, each individual validator running the Prysm client lost about 122,950 gwei, which is worth roughly $0.30 in today’s prices.      No validators were slashed in this process, meaning no users were forcefully removed from the network for malicious behavior. The damage was limited to missed validator rewards.      The incident lasted roughly two hours, where more than 403 blocks were missed. Since then the Prysmatic Labs team has issued a new version of the software with this bug fixed. In a Discord message, co-lead developer at Prysmatic Labs Raul Jordan stressed that all users running Prysm should update their software “immediately.”      “We would neither make an announcement nor a hotfix if we did not have the highest level of confidence in a resolution,” Jordan said.      Any validator who has not yet upgraded to the latest version of Prysm is at risk of missing out on network rewards. While the impact of this bug was most widely seen on April 24, evidence of it appeared on a smaller scale as early as Jan. 20 and as recently as April 25.      For all Eth 2.0 validators who are not running Prysm client software, there is no action needed. CoinDesk’s validator, nicknamed “Zelda,” is run on Lighthouse client software. As a result, we saw little to no change in our daily validator operations and rewards.      One of the biggest lessons to come out of Saturday’s incident, according to Teku developer Ben Edgington, is for “everybody to take client diversity seriously.” It’s difficult to predict when and how another bug in Eth 2.0 client software could be discovered, but what can be controlled is the extent of the damage.      By reducing the percentage of validators running the Prysm client down from 70% and boosting the use of other Eth 2.0 clients, validators and developers can be assured these types of bugs only impact a minority of users on the network.      “If you are running the majority client (which happens to be Prysm right now), then this is your call to action!” Edgington said.    New frontiers: Eth 2.0 after the merge    Friday, April 23, the founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, gave a presentation at the Scaling Ethereum Summit on the development roadmap of Ethereum after its merge to proof-of-stake (PoS).      In his presentation, Buterin outlined an ambitious three- to five-year plan for subsequent upgrades and optimizations to Ethereum, even after the network has fully transitioned to an environmentally friendly and energy-efficient PoS protocol.      Here are some of the highlights:    Post-merge cleanup    Developers are currently estimating the merge will be activated through a backwards-incompatible, system-wide upgrade, also called a “hard fork,” by the end of this year or early next year.      Buterin described the need for a “post-merge cleanup [hard] fork” to happen shortly after the code release.      “It’s not very feature full, not very sexy, but cleanup has to be done. It is the technical debt that has to be paid once this accelerated merge is finished,” said Buterin.      Due to the expedited timeline for activating PoS on Ethereum, there will be redundancies and network inefficiencies that developers are overlooking for the sake of pushing out the upgrade faster.      Once the merge is complete and the network has stabilized, the post-merge, cleanup hard fork will address unnecessary legacy features of a hybrid proof-of-work (PoW) and PoS model. It will also enable new, long-awaited functionalities for validators on Eth 2.0, such as the ability for withdrawals and transfers of their ETH.    Sharding and rollups    Then comes another long-awaited feature on Ethereum: sharding.      Sharding expands Ethereum’s capacity to process transactions by splitting its database into 64 new mini-blockchains. These mini-blockchains or “shards” are able to process transactions and data in parallel. Along with sharding, rollups are a way to condense multiple transactions and reduce their size on any given shard.      With 64 shards simultaneously processing Ethereum transactions and each shard leveraging rollup technology to further optimize the speed at which these transactions are written onto blocks, the issue of high fees and network congestion is finally expected to be resolved for the long term.      Because of the potential dangers and risks associated with Ethereum’s “most promising strategy” for long-term scalability, Buterin highlighted the need to have it as a separate upgrade from all the rest.      “We don’t want to do all the potentially dangerous things at the exact same time. You want to do the first one [Ethereum’s merge to PoS] and then the other so that developers can pay attention and focus,” Buterin said.    Security improvements    With PoS and sharding both implemented, the next step is to make further tweaks to enhance the security of the Ethereum protocol. This includes adding anonymity features to mask validator identities behind block proposals. It also includes leveraging new technologies such as the Verifiable Delay Function (VDF) to further secure the randomness by which validators are assigned their responsibilities and thereby make it harder for malicious actors to disrupt the network.    Statelessness and state expiry    After boosting the robustness of Ethereum’s PoS protocol and shards, Buterin’s suspects developers will begin tackling “medium-term” agenda items, the most important of which, in my view, is the issue of Ethereum’s state.      Ethereum’s state keeps records of all Ethereum accounts, their data and their transaction history. As new user accounts and smart contracts are deployed on Ethereum, the size of Ethereum’s state grows larger and larger. By Buterin’s estimates, state size grows by roughly 30 GB each year. With the latest gas limit increase it’s more likely to grow even faster, up to about 35 GB each year.      Ideally, anyone should be able to spin up their own computer, also called a node, and verify the transaction history of Ethereum. The more independent nodes there are in operation, the more decentralized and secure a blockchain network is. Ethereum’s growing state makes it more time-consuming and resource-intensive for the average user to spin up their own node.      In addition, a large database that takes longer and longer to verify also becomes more vulnerable to distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, which are aimed at taking advantage of a network’s limited resource capacity and overwhelming it with more data than it can handle.      For all these reasons and more, developers are working on solutions to deal with the issue of Ethereum’s state size. One solution called “statelessness” suggests creating two distinct classes of Ethereum nodes. Some would be free of any responsibilities to store state data, while others would be responsible for storing all of it. Another solution, called “state expiry,” suggests reducing state size by archiving parts of Ethereum’s state that are more than a year old.      “This sounds crazy but it’s actually easier to do both at the same time than it is to do either just statelessness or just state expiry, which is interesting. So [this is] a big project. It does have quite a bit of complexity but it has a lot of value [and] potential to do some important good for the ecosystem,” Buterin said.    More big projects    Casper CBC. SNARKs. Quantum resistance. The list goes on.      I haven’t begun to scratch the surface of all that Buterin detailed for his vision of Ethereum’s future roadmap post-merge. With all its breadth, it sounds as if it would need a lot longer than a few years to complete.      Even with a successful activation of PoS, Ethereum is a far way off from going into “maintenance mode” and reaching the same level of protocol stability the Bitcoin network presently maintains.      The main takeaway from this new and updated roadmap for Ethereum’s development is that a transition to PoS is just the beginning. It’s the starting point, rather than the finish line, with still more significant protocol-level changes yet to come on the network.

Partior is intended to develop wholesale payments rails based on digitized commercial bank money, allowing instantaneous settlement between financial institutions.  This, the venture partners said, will help to address the inefficiencies related to multiple validations of payment details by banks and other post-transaction handling and reconciliation activities.  The platform will harness blockchain and smart contracts to enable banks worldwide to conduct real-time cross-border transactions starting with a focus on flows in USD and SGD between the two Singaporean companies and JPMorgan. The platform would then be expanded to other markets and currencies.  JPMorgan has been offering a blockchain-based interbank payments system for several years used by over 400 financial institutions, including many of the world’s largest banks.  The Wall Street behemoth has stressed its LIINK payments rails and JPM coin, now rebranded as onyxcoin (ONYX), are not meant to compete with the likes of SWIFT.

The Tesla CEO tweeted Wednesday “The Dogefather SNL May 8” referring to his hosting spot on ""Saturday Night Live,"" which was announced last week.  The tweet seemingly prompted excitement among dogecoin traders that the meme-based crypto would see further attention in front of a large television audience.  DOGE is a parody crypto derived from the ""Doge"" meme created in 2013, which has seen an increase in price of over 6000% in 2021, thanks in no small way to the attention garnered by the Tesla CEO.  Having trended downwards toward $0.25 over the previous 24 hours, dogecoin spiked more than 20% to over $0.31.  It subsequently pulled back and is priced at just under $0.29 at the time of writing.  Dogecoin most recently featured in Musk’s tweets on April 1 when he claimed that “SpaceX is going to put a literal Dogecoin on the literal moon,” in what may or may not have been an April Fool’s joke as DOGE, like all crypto, is digital by definition and not physical.  Joke or not, the tweet was followed by a 32% rise in the price of the Shiba Inu-represented crypto.

42386579,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBU61l,1619574382,Asian Video Game Publisher Nexon Buys $100M in Bitcoin,"A South Korean-Japanese video game publisher said it made a $100 million purchase of bitcoin, adding itself to the ranks of companies such as Tesla and MicroStrategy that used corporate cash to load up on the leading cryptocurrency.    According to a press release on Wednesday local time, NEXON purchased 1,717 bitcoins at an average price of around $58,226, including fees and expenses.  The company's move follows other publicly listed companies including MicroStrategy and Tesla that are buying into bitcoin as a way for their investors to hedge against inflation.  The purchase represents less than 2% of Nexon's total cash and cash equivalents on hand, the firm says.  “Our purchase of bitcoin reflects a disciplined strategy for protecting shareholder value and for maintaining the purchasing power of our cash assets,” said Owen Mahoney, president and CEO of Nexon, per the release.  The CEO added that, given the current economic environment, his firm believes bitcoin offers ""long-term stability and liquidity"" while also maintaining the value of its cash for future investments.  Major game franchises from the company include MapleStory, KartRider and Dungeon&Fighter.  NEXON is a publicly listed company. It has traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange since 2011, the JPX400 since 2015 and the Nikkei Stock Index 300 since 2017. The company was also added to the Nikkei 225 in 2020.
