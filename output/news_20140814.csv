42377527,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71nsN,1408052138,KnCMiner Enters Final Phase of Titan ASIC Chip Production,"KnCMiner has announced that production of its Titan line of scrypt miners has moved into a new phase.  The cryptocurrency mining hardware maker broke the news on its official blog, indicating that the Titan ASIC chips are now in the wafer encapsulation phase. During this process, a protective layer is applied to electronic components to safeguard the parts from damage caused by temperature and humidity changes.  The update comes nearly two months after KnCMiner said that the tape-out for the Titan had begun. At the time, the company noted that it expected to complete production on the hardware in time for shipment in the third quarter of this year.  The company wrote:  “Our new Titan Scrypt Miner is finishing its first run in fabrication this weekend with wafers being sent to the next step: encapsulation. As so, we’re awaiting completion and the arrival of the finished chips in Stockholm, Sweden, where they’ll move into our testing and assembly phase, for delivery.”  More design elements revealed  The announcement is the latest news related to the Titan, which has been in active development since early this year. Pre-orders for the Titan began in March, with buyers paying $10,000 per unit. Originally designed to provide roughly 100 MH/s in scrypt mining power, the units were later estimated to produce 250 MH/s instead.  Work on the Titan has continued despite persistent problems for KnCMiner itself. Throughout the Titan's production period, KnCMiner has been dogged by accusations of deceptive business practices and negligence resulting in problematic deliveries to customers.  The wafer encapsulation update follows a recent statement saying that the Titan will sport a modular design, with each chip contained within what KnCMiner called “cubes”. At the time, the hardware maker declared that the approach made sense from a cooling and operational perspective, saying:  “Each module having it’s own case also enhances efficiency in cooling and we can make each cube very quiet.”  The post also suggests that the printed circuit board utilized for the Titan will be the same kind used in its Neptune mining product. Finally, the company said that finalized specifications for the Titan would be released once testing has been completed.

42377531,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71nut,1408050315,GAW Acquires $8 Million Stake in ZenMiner,"The Geniuses at Work Corporation, the parent company of bitcoin mining hardware specialist GAW Miners, has acquired a controlling stake in cloud mining provider ZenMiner for $8m.  GAW Miners  had originally announced a partnership deal with ZenMiner earlier this month. At the time, ZenMiner agreed to provide cloud hashing services as part of a broader strategic partnership.  In the latest deal, GAW Corp. acquired a controlling stake in the cloud hosting company. GAW CEO Josh Garza told CoinDesk, the stake purchase follows a period of close collaboration between the two companies, and that the development also reflects the growing role of hardware hosting in bitcoin mining company business models.  As Garza explained, the deal will allow GAW customers to either receive their miners through the mail or immediately begin hashing through the hosting service. By bridging the connection between hardware seller and hosting service, miners can generate revenue more quickly, he said.  Garza explained that the deal's main benefit is that it puts more power in the hands of hardware-buying customers, saying:  “I just want to help miners make some money, help get them some return on investment (ROI). I’m just so tired of manufacturers milking miners for all the money they can.”  The GAW CEO added that the ZenMiner deal is part of Project Prime, a broader effort to bring resources and information to the mining community and industry. The project notably includes the purchase of the BTC.com domain name last month for a record $1m.  Hosting as a value solution  As Garza explained, the ZenMiner deal reflects a potential solution to a growing problem for bitcoin miners: the rapid depreciation of their hardware.  Currently, Garza argued, the developmental arc of mining hardware puts buyers who expect speedy deliveries at an advantage, especially if they have to wait months before their package arrives.  With the ZenMiner hardware hosting solution, miners can choose whether they want to begin hashing immediately or wait to receive their equipment. According to Garza, control of the hardware ultimately rests with the customer.  Garza said:  “You still own it, it’s your equipment. At any given time, you can give us a call, click a button and we’ll send it to you.”  The partnership between GAW Miners and ZenMiner has been mutually beneficial, Garza suggested, making the decision to acquire a controlling stake at the holding company level a no-brainer.  He concluded by saying that, ultimately, the deal “allows us to work more closely together”.

42395294,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASaH45,1408046419,"Jed McCaleb, Ripple Labs Strike Deal to Avoid 9 Billion XRP Sell-Off","Ripple Labs has reached an agreement that will prevent original co-founder Jed McCaleb from selling 9bn XRP – the portion of the protocol's native currency he was awarded for starting the company – this year.  The open-source payment network provider issued the announcement in a blog post penned by director of communications Monica Long. The post said that McCaleb, who recently launched his new project Stellar, had agreed to a distribution timeline that will block him from selling more than a specific amount of XRP each year over the next seven years.  Under the terms of the plan, McCaleb cannot sell more than $10,000 worth of XRP per week for the first year of the agreement.  Long indicated that the plan will allow McCaleb the freedom to liquidate some of his holdings, while preventing his decision from having a significantly negative impact on the larger XRP market.  She wrote:  ""For context, $10,000 per week currently comprises less than 1% of volume, so it'd have a minimal impact to the price of XRP. For the next four weeks, he retains an option to sell up to $2.5m of XRP off market to a single counterparty vetted by Ripple Labs.""  Notably, the price of Ripple fell by 40% on 22nd May, the day McCaleb took to the company's XRP Talk forum to announce he would move to sell all his XRP holdings over a two-week span.  Terms and conditions  The deal sets firm limitations on the amount of XRP McCaleb can sell over a seven-year period, with the timeline allowing McCaleb more freedom to sell his XRP holdings over time.  The remainder of the schedule prevents McCaleb from selling more than:  $20,000 per week during the second, third and fourth years  750m XRP per year for the fifth and sixth years  1bn XRP per year for the seventh year  2bn XRP per year after the seventh year.  Following McCaleb's announcement that he would liquidate his holdings, CEO Chris Larsen agreed to gift 7bn XRP to the Ripple Foundation for Financial Innovation, which was established to help underbanked consumers around the world.  Putting the past to rest  Ripple Labs' original founders retained 20bn XRP as compensation for the risks associated with starting the company in what has long proved to be one of the company's more controversial decisions. Eighty billion XRP was then given to Ripple Labs to facilitate its operations.  The post indicated that Ripple co-founder and chief strategist Arthur Britto had previously signed a similar agreement limiting the rate at which he could liquidate his XRP holdings.  Long ended the post by acknowledging past disagreements between Larsen and McCaleb. Further, she remarked that the deal illustrates how the co-founders have been able to put aside serious differences to ensure Ripple will be able to complete its stated goal of revolutionizing finance.  Long concluded:  ""Our team at Ripple Labs, our partners, investors and I'm sure you, our community, are pleased to have reached a final, constructive outcome as we continue on with the important work we care about and believe in so deeply.""

42377544,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71o7T,1408033513,"Price of Bitcoin Falls to $500, Lowest Level Since May","The price of bitcoin on the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) dropped below $500 today.  At 2.30pm UTC, the price had fallen nearly 9% to $496.27, its lowest level since 21st May, when concerns about restrictive regulation in China were widespread.  Notably, the decline below $500 was short lived, with the BPI quickly rebounding over the $500 mark to reach $512.26 at press time.  No clear cause  Though no one news event could clearly be linked to the price decline, speculation was rampant on Reddit and other bitcoin community mainstays as to what factors were contributing to the market decline.  In its most recent BitBeat report, the Wall Street Journal suggested that the recent US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau warning and Bitstamp's announcement that it had changed banking partners were both potential factors.    Dear Bitstamp customers-please make sure you use our updated banking details when sending your transfer to Bitstamp.      — Bitstamp (@Bitstamp) August 13, 2014      However, WSJ acknowledged that uncertainty over US regulation may have also been a contributing cause.  Vytautas Karalevičius  , Spectro Coin co-founder and CEO, told CoinDesk he believes all three events to be contributing factors, though he said Bitstamp might have been the most important of the three, adding:  ""Bitstamp changing its bank provider from Unicredit to Raiffeisen might have two effects. Firstly, some deposits to old Unicredit account are bouncing back, so people who were willing to buy bitcoin these days do not support the demand for it. Also, it shows a potential problem [even the] most liquid exchanges face.""  Though the proposal was first introduced last month, a growing number of bitcoin's business leaders have started moving to formally contest the proposed framework. Boston-based bitcoin startup Circle even declared yesterday it would not serve New York customers should the laws be enacted.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Shawn Sloves, CEO of global bitcoin exchange network Atlas ATS offered a different take. He suggested that overall saturating in the bitcoin exchange market remains a contributing factor. New York regulation, regardless of the form in which it passes, will be a boon for the industry, he added.  Sloves explained:  ""From what I have seen, there's a saturation point of exchanges popping up every week in different countries, and they're creating fragmentation and turning bitcoins and digital currencies, and because of the lack of liquidity, it adds to the volatility.""  China's markets mirror US  At press time, China's markets had seen a similar reaction, with the price of bitcoin on the CoinDesk CNY BPI falling nearly 8% to hit ¥3,075.27.  This figure was down from an opening price of ¥3,339.58, which was also the market's daily high.  The CoinDesk CNY BPI tracks the price of bitcoin at major China-based bitcoin exchanges such as BTC China, Huobi and OKCoin.  Optimism remains  Despite the recent price decline, bitcoin industry leaders expressed optimism in conversations with CoinDesk that the development would be little more than a speedbump on bitcoin's road to mainstream adoption.  Payza  business development consultant Charlie Shrem, for example, noted that the current price drop represents an opportunity for certain segments of the bitcoin market, saying:  ""Being a 'long term bull', it's a good opportunity to pick up cheap coins. For day traders, like they always say, 'Buy low sell high.'""  Expresscoin  CMO and co-founder Joseph Hsieh further emphasized the long-term value of bitcoin to CoinDesk, adding:  ""If you're a technologist, then the price is the least interesting aspect compared to bitcoin's utility and underlying potential. The dotcom crash killed the total market valuation of internet companies, but it never killed the underlying value of the internet.""

Called Hive Wallet, the app is free, takes up just 2MB of users' precious memory and requires iOS 7.0 or later to run properly. The company says the app is optimised for the iPhone 5, which will also apply to the subsequent 5S and 5C models.  The company announced its new product with a simple tweet:    Hive, a #Bitcoin and #Litecoin wallet for iPhone and iPad now available! https://t.co/aY1btPr5FD      — Hive (@hivewallet) August 13, 2014      The Hive app for iOS was listed on iTunes on 13th August and it is available in German and English language user interfaces. The company already has wallets available for Mac OS X and Android devices, as well as an online version.  Feature set  Following Apple's controversial ban on cryptocurrency wallets in early 2014, Hive was busy developing a browser-run HTML 5 web wallet that would have circumvented the ruling. However, the change of policy at Apple in June allowed the company to develop this, its first app for iOS.  The new iOS wallet looks rather like a hybrid of the HTML5 app and Hive's Android equivalent, providing a clean user interface, but with a number of features neatly included without adding clutter.  Notably, the wallet features support for both bitcoin and litecoin, with more cryptocurrencies said to be coming soon.  Like other Hive wallets, it also offers a geo-location feature called 'Waggle', which allows users to exchange funds with other nearby Hive users with ease. A native QR code scanner is on board, too.  The new app is a hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet and Hive says each transaction generates a new address in the BIP32 tree, “ensuring maximum privacy”. With HD wallets, a passphrase is used to generate the wallet, making it recoverable in the event of a lost PIN or corrupted hard drive, and which can be used across devices.  App Store rivals  Since Apple lifted its ban on wallet apps three months ago, we have witnessed an upsurge in mobile wallet development for the platform.  Several familiar apps have now appeared in Apple’s walled garden, including the Blockchain wallet – the most popular wallet out there, with over two million downloads so far (across all platforms). Blockchain saw its original iOS wallet taken down by Apple in February.

Speaking to Reuters, Patrick Byrne said he expects bitcoin sales of $6m to $8m this year and confirmed that Overstock’s cumulative bitcoin sales have now passed the $2m mark.  Byrne added that he expects bitcoin sales to reach $1m per month by the end of the year, up from upwards of $300,000 per month earlier this summer.  The retailer reached its first million dollars in bitcoin sales in early March and reported a total of $1.6m in bitcoin purchases in late May.  Boost to bottom line  Furthermore, although bitcoin currently accounts for less than 0.25% of Overstock’s sales revenues, Byrne indicated that the firm's overall profits are expected to increase thanks to the decision to start accepting the digital currency in January.  Specfically, Overstock's EPS (earnings per share) for 2014 is expected to be in the 70-80 cent range, with an estimated 4 cents being the result of bitcoin sales, he said.  ""We're in bitcoin for the long haul, I intend to make it permanent,"" Byrne told Reuters, adding that cryptocurrencies will be around for “as long as the law of mathematics works”.  Committed to bitcoin  Overstock's commitment to bitcoin goes further than just sales, however. The company recently announced plans to pay out employee bonuses in bitcoin and said it is considering making regular payroll payments available in the digital currency too.  Byrne previously announced that Overstock would start offering special deals to vendors who choose to start accepting bitcoin, including discounts and favourable terms of payment, and pledged to donate 3% of its bitcoin profits to organisations that promote cryptocurrencies.  Byrne also told Business Insider today that cryptocurrency enthusiasts have approached him at conferences to say they are switching to Overstock in a show of support for the firm's stance on bitcoin.  “That’s what I get in the bitcoin community. It’s become part of the bitcoin ethic to go and buy something on Overstock.com,” he said. “We’re associated with bitcoin at this point.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/08/14/overstock-ceo-reveals-bitcoin-sales-averaging-15k-per-day,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b1ed7fd6e89c56547ac6f278ecd1ab9d2c127abd-1000x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377525,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71npr,1408020352,TV Giant DISH Launches Bitcoin Payments Program,"DISH customers can now use bitcoin to pay their monthly TV bills.  The Colorado-based company went live with its bitcoin payments program today as part of its previously announced third-quarter rollout.  The first customers to pay for DISH services using bitcoin are Austin and Beccy Craig. The American couple have famously chronicled their attempts to live using only digital currency on their Life on Bitcoin bloghttp://lifeonbitcoin.com/blog/.  Speaking to CoinDesk, DISH head of corporate communications John Hall framed the news as part of the company's overarching goal to embrace innovation:  ""DISH has always been about investing in better customer experience, whether that's changing the way that we watch TV or the way that we bill.""  Hall said the company's bitcoin payment option will now be visible to those using its online My DISH accounts and its Hopper HD DVR devices.  ""You can actually go into an app within the Hopper and pay your bill, and now if you choose bitcoin, it will come [up] with a QR code that you can pay right on your TV screen,"" Hall added.  DISH will accept payments through bitcoin merchant processor Coinbase.  Life on Bitcoin gets easier  Beccy Craig told CoinDesk that, while she was previously been a DISH customer, she's looking forward to resuming the service now that she can make monthly payments in bitcoin.  She also illustrated how a service like the one now available through DISH could have improved her experience living solely on bitcoin, saying:  ""I keep thinking about how nice it would've been to have when we were living on bitcoin. We were so limited in what we were doing even just day-to-day, like driving 40 miles each way to go get gas. We didn't really have a lot of entertainment when we were living on bitcoin.""  Austin Craig added: ""We had a lot of time to read books and take hikes, but there were not very many luxuries like DISH.""  While TV may have been off limits at the time, the couple did have some success stretching the limits of what was available for purchase with bitcoin, even booking airline travel and hotel stays.  The couple's adventure is due to be chronicled as part of the as-yet unreleased ' Life on Bitcoinhttp://lifeonbitcoin.com/’ documentary. As of June, the project was in the process of being submitted to at least one major film festival.  DISH expects slow customer response  Though Hall confirmed DISH is excited about its newest payment offering, he said the company is still unsure as to what the initial response will be from consumers.  ""To be quite honest, it's too early to tell,"" Hall said. ""[We've] heard some pretty good feedback from consumers that are interested in doing this with DISH, which is encouraging, but you can't really put a number on what the response will be.""  He went on to suggest that the company expects a small number of new subscribers as a result of the payment option, but that the amount of these customers will increase over time.  ""Likely we'll start slow and go from there,"" he added.  DISH is currently the second-largest bitcoin-accepting business by annual revenue, earning $13.9m a year.

42377539,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71o4x,1408010806,Could Avalancha Become Argentina's Overstock?,"Argentina has long been looked to by bitcoin enthusiasts as a fertile area for consumer adoption due to the unstable nature of the country's native currency, the Argentine peso.  Still, while a growing number of Argentines are using bitcoin as an alternative store of value in a time of economic turbulence, the country has yet to see many merchants capitalize on digital currency's rising popularity in the region.  BitPagos  , the country's leading bitcoin merchant processor, for example, reports it has enrolled just 600 merchants to date. By comparison, major US processors such as BitPay and Coinbase have each signed up more than 30,000 small and large businesses.  However, the narrative surrounding merchant bitcoin adoption in Latin America may be primed for change. One of the larger merchants now serving local bitcoin users is Avalancha, the newly launched online electronics and home goods store that on 7th August announced a partnership with local bitcoin payment processor BitPagos and Latin America-focused bitcoin exchange Bitex.la.  Speaking to CoinDesk, BitPagos CEO Sebastian Serrano indicated that he is optimistic that Avalancha will become the major merchant that inspires other online retailers to begin seriously considering both bitcoin and his company's service.  ""I think it's going to be a catalyst that is going to help us increase adoption even more. It has been covered in major newspapers and it's going to be similar to Overstock in the effect internally for the online companies.""  Avalancha aims to generate 25m pesos in revenue by the year's end, or roughly $3m.  Argentina's Overstock moment  The comparison to Overstock, considered by many to be the first major retailer to enter the bitcoin ecosystem in January of this year, is a lofty one. Not only has the US-based company accepted bitcoin, but it has also become a visible leader in the space, exploring the ecosystem's more experimental technologies and appearing at major bitcoin conferences.  Still, the comparison could hold merit due to the fact that overall bitcoin awareness in Argentina is low among merchants. Miguel Klurfan, CEO of Avalancha, told CoinDesk:  ""I think the average merchant is not fully aware of bitcoin. They probably heard about bitcoin but they certainly don’t have a clue of how it works and the benefits it might have for their business.""  Despite its relative newcomer status – Avalancha launched in May – Serrano believes the retailer has the right connections to become a major player in Argentina's e-commerce market.  Avalancha is notably funded by Newsan Group, a leading manufacturer in Argentina, a significant connection that Serrano believes isn't to be understated.  ""Argentina has very high restrictions for importing, so it's very difficult to import anything. One way to import [products] is to assemble that product in the country. Newsan assembles Samsung products, laundry machines and more.""  Building the ecosystem  Klurfan told CoinDesk that Overstock was an influence on his company's decision to accept bitcoin, though he acknowledged that Dell’s association with the digital currency was also a factor.  The CEO said that Avalancha has been watching Overstock's announcements and monitoring its bitcoin sales updates. He, too, is optimistic about how his company could provide a similar success story to the Latin American bitcoin ecosystem, saying:  ""[Bitcoin] will need some new players to get involved in the system for it to be able to work as a means of exchange, and that's the part that, at Avalancha, we can help. We can help to make bitcoin good for exchanging products and not only for storing value.""  Still, Klurfan suggested that he doesn't expect to see the sales success that Overstock and other large merchants have enjoyed in the US, adding:  ""For us, accepting bitcoin is a way to express our belief in the currency and its potential as a sales generator in the mid-term. But, we don’t expect huge sales coming from bitcoin in the near future.""  Weighing the risks  Despite warnings from Argentina's central bank regarding bitcoin payments, Klurfan said that he and his company see a bright future for bitcoin and its related technologies.  Klurfan told CoinDesk that one of the central reasons Avalancha adopted bitcoin is because the company believes it simply offers consumers the most convenient way to way for goods, explaining:  ""We are focused on giving the best online experience available to our customers and I believe it's much easier to pay with bitcoin than it is to pay with wire transfer or pay with any other payment.""  Though bitcoin's price volatility may be a turnoff for merchants in developed countries, Klurfan believes that in Argentina, this pain point doesn't exist for his business or his customers.  For example, he noted that for him, dealing with currency fluctuations is simply a way of life.  ""Our currency has been losing value since the day I was born,"" he said. ""I have seen it equal with the dollar and now it's 8.25 pesos to the US dollar. [...] I don't see any difference between the volatility of bitcoin and the volatility of the peso.""  Market advantage  Klurfan went on to explain that, as a new player in Argentina's e-commerce space, Avalancha may have been uniquely primed to capitalize on accepting bitcoin.  Klurfan sees his company as fundamentally different than other more traditional merchants, adding:  ""We are 100% online, we were conceived from the beginning as a technology company.""  Furthermore, this positions the company to believe in bitcoin as a technology, and to be able to better understand how it might be able to more fully realize its capabilities over time.  ""I believe that since Argentina is a country that is used to unstable currencies, the adoption of bitcoin will be faster than in other places,"" he added.  Regulatory threat looms  Still, the biggest determining factor to the long-term success of Avalancha's bitcoin payments plan will be how Argentina's government decides to react to digital currency use more broadly.  For instance, Klurfan acknowledges that Argentina could embrace similar policies as Ecuador and Bolivia, effectively banning the use of non-fiat currencies, concluding:  ""In case the government decides to crack down bitcoin, we will be very disappointed and have no choice but to adapt to the new regulatory context.""  Conversations with CoinDesk and other Latin American business leaders have found there is widespread fear about how Argentina could react to bitcoin, though many are optimistic it could lead the way in bringing the innovative technology to the mainstream.

Speaking to industry publication CentralBanking.com, Menon answered questions about whether money should remain under the control of central banks, and why the MAS had decided to regulate ""virtual currency intermediaries"".  He said:  ""It is hard to divine how technology and practices will evolve, 20 or 30 years from now. I would say virtual currencies have a role to play, but I doubt they will replace the fiat money that central banks issue – but I could be wrong.""  Digital currencies' biggest advantages were cost-efficient and fast transfers, he said, but they lacked any central bank backing.  Wildly fluctuating prices also meant digital currencies did not meet the basic requirement of money as a store of value, he added.  ""Nonetheless, digital currencies have a role to play, which is why we have not sought to ban them, or make it more difficult for them to operate. We still have Bitcoin ATMs here in Singapore. But we do see a clear and present danger in the form of money laundering and terrorism financing risk, because of the anonymity in virtual currency transactions.""  Repeating the oft-heard statements from central banks and financial professionals about bitcoin's supposed role in money laundering and financing of terrorist activities, Menon said the anonymity of virtual currencies was a danger.  All intermediaries would have to follow know-your-customer (KYC) and associated regulations, he continued, saying digital currency companies would welcome this news as it would ""weed out intermediaries that use virtual currencies for illicit purposes"".  The risks would be addressed ""in a targeted way"" to allow innovation to still take place.  Singapore's fintech pedigree helps bitcoin  David Moskowitz, founder of Singapore-based bitcoin trading platform Coin Republic, told CoinDesk Singapore's status as a world financial hub meant it couldn't afford to ignore bitcoin and other financial technology innovation.  He said:    ""MAS clearly sees the potential that cryptocurrencies hold for local economic growth. As the nature of finance changes with technological advances, the old models will become obsolete. As they did with the hedge fund, banking, and insurance markets, the government of Singapore has an excellent track record of foreseeing the next wave of opportunity for economic growth of her economy.""      ""I don't think they will sit idle while London, or Isle of Man, attempt to take leadership in the digital currency space. The public statement by MAS director Ravi Menon, and recent 'bitcoin experiment' by their sovereign wealth fund reaffirms this.""    Singapore's government-owned investment company, Temasek Holdings, made headlines in the digital currency world in June when its chairman spoke about its experiments with bitcoin, including staff using Blockchain wallets and donating bitcoins to their preferred charities.  A variety of bitcoin startups  Singapore was marked early on as a potential haven for bitcoin and digital currency development. As a business and financial-services-oriented city-state, it currently has S$1.82tn ($1.45tn) of assets under management and is also a regional hub for IT startups.  It has more than eight bitcoin ATMs installed from four different manufacturers, including the native-grown Tembusu. In May, representatives from a number of digital currency companies launched the Association of Cryptocurrency Enterprises and Startups (ACCESS) to represent the industry in discussions with other businesses and policy-makers.  MAS  had previously told Coin Republic that it ""would not interfere"" with bitcoin or attempt to regulate it, but then announced in March this year that it would take steps to regulate bitcoin exchanges and ATM companies to address risks associated with money laundering and terrorism financing.
