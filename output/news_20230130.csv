42421952,hkpwiFmxYEifjUax0eQyWW,1675122110,Alameda Seeks to Recover $446M in Crypto Paid to Voyager After Lender's Bankruptcy,"Defunct crypto trading firm Alameda Research – one arm of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried's former empire – wants to regain around $446 million transferred to bankrupt lender Voyager Digital prior to Alameda's own bankruptcy filing, according to a new lawsuit.  According to a complaint filed Monday against Voyager Digital and HTC Trading, Alameda repaid all of its outstanding loans to Voyager after the lender filed for bankruptcy protection in July. Some of these loans had yet to mature at the time Voyager requested their repayment.  ""The collapse of Alameda and its affiliates amid allegations that Alameda was secretly borrowing billions of FTX-exchange assets is widely known,"" the filing said. ""Largely lost in the (justified) attention paid to the alleged misconduct of Alameda and its now-indicted former leadership has been the role played by Voyager and other cryptocurrency 'lenders' who funded Alameda and fueled that alleged misconduct, either knowingly or recklessly.""  Voyager had 10 different loan sheets with Alameda at the time it filed for bankruptcy, the filing said. In various filings in September and October 2022, Voyager claimed it held FTT (an exchange token issued by FTX) and SRM (the token for the Serum protocol) as collateral for loans made to Alameda in the form of various cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, dogecoin, ether, USDC, litecoin and others.  Alameda repaid Voyager its loans in the form of bitcoin, ether and the other cryptocurrencies mentioned above, the filing said.  The trading shop's lawyers said in Monday's filing that they had ""been unable to determine whether [Voyager] held a valid and effective lien or security interest"" in this collateral at any time or whether the ""purported collateral"" was actually tied to any of Alameda's obligations.

It's already known that the FTX founder's parents also co-signed, but the other names were kept private.  The New York judge overseeing Bankman-Fried's criminal trial ruled in favor of four separate petitions by a number of news organizations seeking the names of these individuals, who signed onto the bond earlier this month. The ruling is stayed pending a possible appeal until at least Feb. 7.  A slew of media companies, including the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg and CoinDesk, had filed suit to get the court to release the identities of the two people, saying that “the public’s interest in this matter cannot be overstated.”  Bankman-Fried’s lawyers had argued the possibility of physical threats to the parties were reasons to keep their identities private.",NEUTRAL,없음,OTHER,Nelson Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/01/30/judge-rules-identities-of-2-parties-who-backed-sam-bankman-frieds-250b-bond-can-be-revealed,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4ea78b69aed3d0907827f2027cceaf248dd7e698-6903x4602.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42421962,hkpwiFmxYEifjUax0eQypw,1675120766,VitaDAO Closes $4.1M Funding Round With Pfizer Ventures for Longevity Research,"VitaDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) focused on raising funds for research on extending human life, has closed a $4.1 million funding round with Pfizer Ventures and several others.  VitaDAO was started in 2021 by Tyler Golato of decentralized biotech protocol Molecule to fund longevity research. According to the organization, it boasts a community of over 9,000 ""enthusiasts, researchers and contributors,"" and deployed over $3.5 million to projects researching diseases of aging, cellular biology and repairing age-related damage to the body in 2022.  The latest funding round includes pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Ventures; venture fund Shine Capital; investment group L1 Digital; decentralized science organizations BeakerDAO and Spaceship DAO; and longevity enthusiasts including former Coinbase Chief Technology Officer Balaji Srinivasan and Retro Biosciences' Joe Betts-LaCroix. Previous investors include Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.  According to VitaDAO, Pfizer is the first pharmaceutical company to vote on DAO proposals and participate in the incubation and commercialization of VitaDAO projects.  Proceeds from the latest round will go toward funding longevity research projects and building out VitaDAO's first biotech startup, slated to be announced in the first quarter of 2023. In addition, the group plans to invest further in the ""commercialization and licensing"" of its non-fungible token (NFT) intellectual property (IP) through its partnership with Molecule.  VitaDAO's deal flow steward Laurence Ion said that several projects funded by VitaDAO have moved to the next stages of development, including clinical trials with Mantis Photonics, which seeks to diagnose Alzheimer's Disease through retinal imaging.  ""There's a move away in medicine to solve the symptoms of aging,"" said Todd White, operations steward at VitaDAO. ""There's a lot of discussion around 'is aging a disease?' A lot of people are of the mindset now that aging and a lot of the diseases of aging ... can actually be resolved.""  The group is governed by its native VITA token and holders can vote on what projects to support, while a group of ""stewards"" helps to ""facilitate"" the execution of those proposals, said White.  Ion told CoinDesk that with its democratic governance structure, the group aims to move beyond physical locations and is thinking about ""a potential future sovereignty network.""  ""I think we need a new paradigm,"" he said. ""We want to be a community as big as some countries and as resourceful as some countries.""  Crypto enthusiasts have long been into longevity science and delaying human aging. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong funded a company called NewLimit in December 2021 to ""cure aging,"" while former Ripple chief technology officer and current Stellar co-founder Jed McCaleb founded the Astera Institute to fund longevity studies.  White said the overlap between the crypto industry and the longevity research field is no coincidence. ""If you think about how crypto started, it was about breaking down barriers and fixing a system that they perceived as broken. Well, the same applies in longevity.""

42421969,hkpwiFmxYEifjUax0eQzC8,1675120383,Bitcoin Suffers Largest Daily Plunge Since November to Sink Below $22.6K as Fed Meeting Looms,"Bitcoin dipped below $22,600 at one point Monday to record its biggest single-day percentage loss since early November when the FTX meltdown sent the crypto market reeling.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $22,720, down more than 4.5% after climbing over $23,900 on Sunday for the first time since mid-August. Ether (ETH) dropped 5% to trade around $1,550 Monday. The CoinDesk Market Index was down 4.8% for the day.  The last time BTC lost such an amount in a day was Nov. 9 when BTC plunged 14%, according to data from TradingView.  Some $44 million worth of BTC long positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours, part of a broader crypto market's Monday decline, according to Coinglass data.  Crypto-exposed stocks also sank, reflecting investors’ nervousness about the crypto market.  Exchange giant Coinbase (COIN) closed down over 8%, while bitcoin miner Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) sank around 10%.  “Bitcoin is declining as Wall Street becomes very defensive ahead of this week’s major risk events,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange Oanda, wrote in a Monday note.  Traders are expecting the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) at its Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which begins Tuesday, although some analysts believe that a 50 (bps) hike remains a possibility amid ongoing worries about inflation.  Bitcoin’s recent resistance below $24,000 underscores this concern, and Moya noted that “for crypto to have any underlying support given all the regulatory and contagion fears, inflation risks need to go away.”  He added: “Bitcoin has massive resistance at the $24,000 level, so if risk aversion remains in place, downward momentum might not find major support until the $21,000 region.” ​",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/30/bitcoin-suffers-largest-daily-plunge-since-november-to-sink-below-226k-as-fed-meeting-looms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c9eaeb9fc09add7bcfc5e7d1729112999788aed3-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421955,hkpwiFmxYEifjUax0eQykO,1675119711,"Bitcoin Suisse Chairman Says EU Won’t Ban Crypto, but It May Seek to Contain It","Building a firewall that separates crypto from the traditional financial system may be the best approach to keep the digital asset industry alive in the European Union, Luzius Meisser, chairman of crypto firm Bitcoin Suisse, told CoinDesk TV’s “All About Bitcoin” on Monday.  Meisser said the “containment” strategy, which is one of four strategies the Zug, Switzerland-based firm has outlined, could be beneficial to crypto and the traditional finance marketplace. He said containing crypto is what EU lawmakers are on track to pursue.  “Their intention is to protect, to shield, the traditional financial system from the toxicity of the crypto economy,” Meisser said. “But maybe, it also helps protect cryptocurrencies from the traditional financial systems with all its faults and mistakes.”  Last week, EU lawmakers voted to impose strict restrictions on banks looking to hold crypto by requiring firms to hold a euro of their own capital for every euro held in crypto. The stipulations outlined reflect closely those set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the industry’s international standard setter.  Crypto banking rules proposed by the committee will become even “more extreme” towards crypto, according to Meisser, who points to the 1% to 2% rule as an example. The restrictions, set to take effect at the beginning of 2025, will limit a bank’s exposure to crypto, capping it at 2%.  “It means for every bitcoin you hold for a client, you need to have one bitcoin on top of that in equity,” Meisser said. “It basically prohibits banking with bitcoin,” he later added.  Meisser said what this means is that “you cannot have a traditional bank account where the client just has a claim in bitcoin.”  As part of the Committee's rules, it would also mean that crypto would not be recognized as collateral, Meisser said, making it more difficult for a bank to issue a client a loan in the future for example. Doing so would only give banks the runway to store crypto for their clients, he said.  Nonetheless, lawmakers are unlikely to ban crypto outright, Meisser said, because “it’s not compatible with liberal political order.”  He said it is also unlikely that lawmakers will take a laissez faire approach and let the market work itself out because it would “defeat their own purpose” and make them “obsolete.”  Read more: EU Lawmakers Impose ‘Prohibitive’ Requirements on Banks’ Crypto Holdings",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/01/30/bitcoin-suisse-chairman-says-eu-wont-ban-crypto-but-it-may-seek-to-contain-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4db6708180abf065c411f6e496c89f9894e32bd4-1885x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In the same time frame, the coin fell by almost 6%. Over the last week, however, MATIC registered sharp gains as it appreciated by nearly 13%. The MATIC price currently stands at a critical point, as a break above the immediate resistance mark will help the altcoin to propel its price considerably. The technical outlook of the altcoin continues to side with the bulls despite the recent fall in price. Related Reading: Dogecoin Surges 6% After Elon Musk Unveils Crypto Payment Master Plan This also means that bullish momentum hasn’t died down yet. The buying strength has remained strong over the last week, but the coin has seen a slight buyer downtick on the daily chart. Accumulation, on the other hand, has remained positive. MATIC must secure its local support at the $1.112 level for the coin to continue moving up. By the indicators, buyers could step in as MATIC is headed for another bull run before the price retries again. The altcoin is trading 60% below its all-time high, secured in 2021. MATIC Price Analysis: One-Day Chart Polygon (MATIC) was trading at $1.116 at the time of writing. Over the last week, the coin has breached several critical resistance levels. It is now stuck under its immediate resistance of $1.122; moving above that level will help MATIC to rally by almost 15%. The nearest support for the coin was $1.109, but MATIC has to immediately topple the $1.122 mark to secure $1.120 as its support level. A fall from the $1.109 price will drag the altcoin to $0.99. The amount of MATIC traded in the last session was still green, indicating buyers dominated the market. Technical Analysis The altcoin was overbought twice this year; hence, a minor price correction is expected from the altcoin. The Relative Strength Index was parked above the 60-mark despite the tiny downtick due to the fall in price. It also meant that buyers overpowered sellers in the market. Similarly, MATIC moved above the 20-Simple Moving Average line (SMA), suggesting that buyers were driving the price momentum in the market. The coin was also above the 50-SMA (yellow) and 200-SMA (green), implying prolonged bullishness on the chart. This could mean that altcoin could cross above the immediate resistance, causing the price to soar higher. The other technical indicators have also indicated an upcoming price increase. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicates price momentum and a reversal of the same. MACD formed green signal bars, which were tied to buy signals.

8525408,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=517988,1675119639,"This Level Could Be Crucial For Bitcoin, PoW Pricing Model Suggests","The Bitcoin difficulty per issuance, a proof-of-work (PoW) pricing model, might provide hints about the following crucial level BTC would have to clear. Bitcoin Approaches Difficulty Per Issuance Model 2.0 Level As pointed out by an analyst on Twitter, the BTC price is almost double the cost of production now. The “difficulty per issuance” is a Bitcoin PoW pricing model based on two metrics: the mining difficulty and the issuance. The mining difficulty is a mechanism of the Bitcoin network that sets the computing difficulty for miners to mint new coins and insert blocks on the chain. The difficulty exists because the BTC network was configured to keep its supply production around a constant value. Whenever the Bitcoin hashrate, a measure of the total amount of computing power connected to the blockchain, changes its value, the rate at which miners produce new blocks also fluctuates. As the network is set to prevent this, it adjusts the difficulty exactly as much as is needed to counter these fluctuations. Because the difficulty is dependent on the hashrate in this way, it encapsulates all the mining-related expenses that miners incur and can thus be used to estimate production costs. The difficulty per issuance model is based on this idea. To calculate the cost of 1 BTC, the model divides the difficulty term with the “issuance,” the total amount of new coins added to the circulating supply. Related Reading: Bitcoin Volatility Ahead? Open Interest Registers Sharp Jump Now, here is a chart that shows the three essential levels of this model and where Bitcoin stands in relation to them: The three difficulty per issuance pricing levels | Source: @paulewaulpaul on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin price was under the difficulty per issuance 1.41 level a while back (the middle line). This level represents a kind of average cost of production for the BTC miners. The bottom line gives a lower bound estimation for the cost of production, while the top line gives an upper bound. The chart shows that BTC never touched the lower bound in this cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Touches New ATH Following 4.68% Adjustment With the latest rally, BTC has broken above the 1.41 level and is now approaching the 2.0 level (the upper bound). In the past, Bitcoin has remained between these two levels for extended periods during a few different instances. Usually, bull rallies have taken place after Bitcoin has successfully broken out of this zone in the past. So, if the crypto’s price manages to go beyond this level, it might be a positive sign for investors. However, the coin being rejected from the difficulty per issuance 2.0 level is just as real a possibility as there is historical precedence for it. Now it remains to be seen how the price will react once it retests this line (assuming it even does one in this rally).

Top Story  A co-founder of LayerZero, which provides services to help blockchains bridge digital assets between each other, is denying accusations from a competitor that it covered up the existence of a critical “backdoor” vulnerability in its code, as CoinDesk's Sam Kessler reported.  James Prestwich, founder of the cross-chain bridging service Nomad, alleged in a blog post on Monday that LayerZero can bypass security controls to pass data between blockchains without anyone’s permission.  “A trusted-party vulnerability (also called a ’backdoor’) is an undisclosed capability of a trusted party that can compromise the function of the system,” Prestwich explained in a tweet outlining his findings. According to Prestwich, LayerZero has the ability to unilaterally steal or move around funds locked up with platforms that use its bridging services with default settings.  Bryan Pellegrino, a co-founder of LayerZero, said the project does have backdoor-like capabilities but denied the platform has ever tried to hide them. Pellegrino said LayerZero was open about its security practices and gave the developers the ability to set parameters barring LayerZero from special access privileges.  “What they have wrong is that every application has the ability to just select their own security properties,” Pellegrino told CoinDesk. “All you have to do is set your configuration and there's nothing that anybody can ever do,” he continued. “James knows that describing anything as a critical security vulnerability is insane.”  Pellegrino suggested Prestwich’s motives may be tied to an upcoming Uniswap governance vote to pick a bridge provider.

Crypto Market Analysis: 'Whale' Deposits on Exchanges Surpass Withdrawals  By Glenn Williams Jr.  Per on-chain intelligence firm Glassnode, the net volume of BTC from wallets to exchanges has been increasing since Jan. 22. The movement of coins onto exchanges is often a bearish signal reflecting investors intent to sell assets.  To be sure, the number of whale, or large bitcoin holder, deposits to exchanges has declined in recent weeks, which in isolation is bullish. But the volume of deposits to exchanges exceeds the number of withdrawals on a relative basis, which is not. The withdrawal of assets from exchanges is generally a bullish signal.  Historically, the net volume metric tends to move in waves. Although the current development does not guarantee a selling spree, it may foreshadow what larger investors will do. A prolonged movement of bitcoin to exchanges would signal that larger holders are preparing to sell, which could lead to a price drop. The movement is in early stages, though.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Touches New ATH Following 4.68% Adjustment Cream Finance Exploiter Transfers Funds According to CertiK, a blockchain analytic platform, the exploiter moved 365.69 ETH, worth roughly $600,000 at spot rates, to a new address. The amount is part of the over $136 million tokens stolen in late October 2021. #CertiKSkynetAlert 🚨 Cream Finance exploiter 0x70747df6ac244979a2ae9ca1e1a82899d02bbea4 sent ~$600K (365.69 ETH) to address 0x4648451b5f87ff8f0f7d622bd40574bb97e25980 Stay vigilant! pic.twitter.com/IpFdzctstp — CertiK Alert (@CertiKAlert) January 30, 2023 Funds were moved to another address. It is not yet clear what the hacker intends to do with the $600,000. Cream Finance is a blockchain-agnostic DeFi protocol deployed on Ethereum, Fantom, Polygon, and the BNB Smart Chain (BSC). It was forked from Compound, a competing lending platform, and remains open source. Cream Finance offers a wide range of services, including lending, yield farming, and token exchange. CREAM, the governance token of Cream Finance, is changing hands at $12.83 when writing on January 30. In crypto, addresses holding stolen funds are always marked and therefore tainted. It makes it hard for hackers to launder stolen funds on centralized exchanges or other platforms without being identified. The decision by platforms to join hands to combat money laundering from crypto and DeFi hackers is bearing fruits. These platforms, mostly centralized exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, or Huobi, allow users to purchase fiat currencies, including the USD, JPY, or Euro, and are compliant with applicable know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) rules. This means agents trying to launder funds through these portals can be mapped out in the real world and prosecuted. By picking out this transfer, CertiK is updating the crypto and DeFi community that the perpetrator of the hack is still active and trying to shuffle funds through various addresses. However, considering the transparent nature of underlying blockchains, including Ethereum, it is easy to track transactions despite the sender’s private identity. Any mistake on the hacker’s end can lead to their IP address being uncovered or their identity decrypted, bringing them to the custody of law enforcement agents. To counter this possibility and conceal their tracks, hackers use crypto mixers like Tornado Cash. Despite the United States Treasury Department banning citizens from using mixers like Tornado Cash, users prefer the tool. Many users are hackers wishing to cash out the funds anonymously. DeFi Under Attack In late October 2021, Cream Finance was hacked for over $136 million. The hacker targeted the protocol’s v1 lending market, siphoning several ERC-20 tokens and CREAM governance tokens. Through a series of flash loans, the attacker manipulated the protocol’s yield, allowing for borrowing more assets than collateralized. The attack was the protocol’s third in 2021, questioning the security of DeFi dApps against determined attackers, some of whom might be sponsored by governments like North Korea. In mid-January, Lazarus Group, a hacker cell associated with North Korea, attempted to launder $63.5 million. We detected Harmony One hacker fund movement. They previously tried to launder through Binance and we froze his accounts. This time he used Huobi. We assisted Huobi team to freeze his accounts. Together, 124 BTC have been recovered.

The protocol has been widely criticized for questionable tokenomics and poor transparency. APT, the native coin of the chain, is up nearly 400% YTD. I can't find a legitimate reason. Aptos ( APT-USD ) is one of the hot new blockchains after launching its mainnet in October of last year. APT is the native coin of the Aptos blockchain and it's used for gas fees in transactions. Aptos is actually a remnant of the now-defunct Libra/Diem blockchain that was formerly developed by Meta Platforms ( META ). Aptos is a chain that I have covered previously for Seeking Alpha, and I pointed out what I felt were several red flags at that time. Those red flags included but were not limited to a native coin that has an enormously dilutive emissions model, a large amount of coins allocated to insiders, and poor sentiment about transparency from the larger crypto community. Part of my summary from that first article made mention of the large amount of Layer 1 competitors to Aptos that don't have the negative first impression hurdle to get over: given the proliferation of much larger layer 1 blockchains that already have established communities, I don't think this is one to jump into today. First impressions are important and Aptos' first impression with the crypto community wasn't a good one. At the time, APT was a little under $9. By the end of December, the coin had traded down near $3. End of story, right? Not quite. Since bottoming out near the end of December, Aptos is now up almost 400% year to date and it's still January: APT YTD (Seeking Alpha) Thanks to this rally, APT now has the 26th highest crypto market cap according to CoinMarketCap. It has a higher market cap than Aave ( AAVE-USD ), Synthetix ( SNX-USD ), and Lido Finance ( LDO-USD ). Which are three protocols that are among the most widely used projects in all of crypto. Such a remarkable run in APT begs the question; is this a speculative mania or is there network activity that justifies this level off coin buying? Why is Aptos Going Up? All those red flags from October and none of them even addressed the bigger questions a fundamental investor in this fledgling industry might have; which are simply why does any of this stuff go up or down, and how do we value these digital assets? As I laid out for my BlockChain Reaction subscribers earlier this week , we don't really have industry standard valuation metrics for the crypto industry yet, and it's on us as market participants to try to do our best with the information that we have available to us. For Layer 1 smart contract blockchains like Aptos, we can look at user growth or DeFi activity happening on the chain. So far, there are typically between 20-30k daily active accounts on the network - which isn't nothing, but it's lower than similarly capitalized chains. Furthermore, new account growth seems to be slowing already even during APT's bullish run: DAU Growth (Aptos Labs) Another popular metric to consider is the total value locked, or TVL. This metric can be tricky because TVL increases can sometimes hide the real story if the native coin of the chain is simply increasing in value - as is the case with ATP. When we adjust for the TVL measured in the native asset itself, we can get a better sense for the DeFi health on chain. For Aptos, the TVL peaked at 16.4 million APT in December. APT TVL (DeFi Llama) Aptos is now down to 3.2 million APT in TVL. A breathtaking decline of 80% in just a few weeks. Developer Interest Another way to assess if a chain has a fundamental story is if there is a large number of developer interest or code commits on the chain. This is where Aptos is actually somewhat compelling because there is a much larger amount of developers apparently working on Aptos than on some of the smaller Layer 1 blockchains like Algorand ( ALGO-USD ). However, the trend for most of the other chains has been comparatively stable over the last year while Aptos has seen a big spike leading up to mainnet launch followed by a reversion to pre-launch levels: L1 Developer Trend (Token Terminal) Aptos comes in behind Cardano ( ADA-USD ), Polkadot ( DOT-USD ), Cosmos ( ATOM-USD ), and Solana ( SOL-USD ) regarding active developers but ahead of Binance ( BNB-USD ). The same is true for code commits, but that chart is a bit messy when all chains are on it, the solo asset chart is more beneficial for showing general trend: APT Devs vs Code Commits (Token Terminal) There just isn't as much developer interest in Aptos since the chain launched, and that's a departure from what we're seeing in other well-capitalized chains. Summary So let's answer the question; why is Aptos going up? It's going up because it's going up. There is absolutely no reason for this as far as I can see. I would be very careful chasing anything in the crypto industry right now, let alone new protocol coins that have poor tokenomics, poor sentiment, and poor levels of activity. Aptos is the latter. I called it a hold in October, and that was probably being generous. Today, APT is a sell, in my view.",NEGATIVE,ADA | APT,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TRADING | APT,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4573624-aptos-no-reason-for-this?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/8520043.jpeg

The long-term trend remains bearish, with profitability remaining in negative territory. The sale of the call broken wing butterflies remains a high probability setup with upside risk staying in check. Intro It will be interesting to see how far Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. ( MARA ) can move in its present rally to the upside. As we see below, the cryptocurrency miner has rallied very aggressively out of its late December lows on very strong buying volume. In fact, the sharp-up move has resulted in a bullish trend-line break of the OBV indicator (On-Balance-Volume) which is noteworthy from a short-term standpoint. Why? Because buying volume for the most part precedes bullish share-price action in the financial markets. Suffice it to say, momentum to the upside in Marathon should be manifested initially in the volume trend and this is what we see playing out at present in the stock. From a long-term perspective, however, the deteriorating gross profit margin (-53%) along with the bloated share count are worrying signs, to say the least. The reason being is that when positively generated cash flow has been absent for a considerable period of time, this brings a time element to proceedings. This means equity raises, asset sales, or debt drawdowns need to be consistently utilized in order to meet the shortfall in cash over time. Furthermore, although Marathon's short-term trend has been bullish, it must be remembered that shares are down well over 50% over the past 12 months alone. MARA Technical Chart (StockCharts.com) Suffice it to say, given the stock's long-term bearish trend, Marathon Digital has some pretty heavy resistance above it including the pivotal 200-day moving average of approximately $10.37. In fact, the popular MACD histogram indicator may already be demonstrating that Marathon's uptrend is weakening in strength. Therefore, how can we develop a trading/investing strategy where we believe Marathon may rally somewhat from its current level but still believe upside potential may be constrained? Implied Volatility Our first port of call is to go to Marathon Digital's implied volatility. As we see from the chart below, implied volatility (156%+) is well above the 52-week mean for this stock, which equates to a 52-week IV rank of 61. Furthermore, the company's option volume of 117,000 gives us an edge here with respect to selling Marathon's options. MARA Implied Volatility (StockCharts.com) Furthermore, selling options of Marathon give us an edge because its historical volatility continues to trail the IV number as we see above. We state this because historical volatility is a calculated percentage of how volatile MARA shares have been in the past. Therefore, given that the expected move (implied volatility) is above this calculation, it means that MARA's options are overpriced at present all things remaining equal (which benefits option sellers). Therefore, what we put on recently is the regular March $11/$12.50 Broken Wing Butterfly (purchase of one $11 call for every two sales of the corresponding $12.50 call & the purchase of the $20 call) for a total credit of $0.37 per combo. As we see below, the price of the butterfly has already come down to $0.31 due to both IV and MARA's share price declining in recent sessions. However, what we want here is for MARA to rally up to our short strikes ($12.50) by expiration, where our maximum profit would be $187 per butterfly. The max-loss is in fact much higher due to how much that $20 strike is out of the money. However, this call serves a very important purpose, which is the following. MARA Broken Wing Butterfly (Interactive Brokers) Short interest in MARA continues to rise (44%+) in a stock that is expected to grow its top-line sales by 250%+ ($436 million) next year. Suffice it to say, if growth revisions were to come in better than expected and if the short-interest ratio continues to expand, this would give rise to a prime short-squeeze scenario, especially if shares rally above overhead resistance. Therefore, the $20 call is crucial as it defines our risk in this setup, which is important if the above were to take place. Conclusion Marathon Digital Holdings has started the year off very well with strong buying volume. Furthermore, the up move has spiked implied volatility well above its 52-week mean, with calls continuing to trade richer than puts. Our broken wing butterfly setup wants MARA to continue rallying but not above our $12.50 short strikes. Let's see what unfolds. We look forward to continued coverage.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4573622-marathon-digital-using-high-iv-to-sell-broken-wing-butterflies?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/8519809.jpeg
42421956,hkpwiFmxYEifjUax0eQyTk,1675110895,Bridge Platform LayerZero Denies Allegations It Kept ‘Backdoor’ Secret,"A co-founder of LayerZero, which provides services to help blockchains bridge digital assets between each other, is denying accusations from a competitor that it covered up the existence of a critical “backdoor” vulnerability in its code.  James Prestwich, founder of the cross-chain bridging service Nomad, alleged in a blog post on Monday that LayerZero can bypass security controls in order to pass data between blockchains without anyone’s permission.  “A trusted-party vulnerability (also called a ’backdoor’) is an undisclosed capability of a trusted party, that can compromise the function of the system,” Prestwich explained in a tweet outlining his findings. According to Prestwich, LayerZero has the ability to unilaterally steal or move around funds locked up with platforms that use its bridging services with default settings.  Bryan Pellegrino, a co-founder of LayerZero, said the project does have backdoor-like capabilities but denied the platform has ever tried to hide them. Pellegrino said LayerZero was open about its security practices and gave the developers the ability to set parameters barring LayerZero from special access privileges.  “What they have wrong is that every application has the ability to just select their own security properties,” Pellegrino told CoinDesk. “All you have to do is set your configuration and there's nothing that anybody can ever do,” he continued. “James knows that describing anything as a critical security vulnerability is insane.”  Pellegrino suggested Prestwich’s motives may be tied to an upcoming Uniswap governance vote to pick a bridge provider.  Pellegrino said competing bridge providers such as Nomad and Wormhole have the same “backdoor” capabilities that Prestwich attributes to LayerZero. “In the worst case, LayerZero is equivalent to how Wormhole or how any other messaging layer works,” he told CoinDesk.  Other bridges – including Nomad, which suffered from a nine-figure hack over the summer – have similar access capabilities to LayerZero’s, he added.  “The difference between a backdoor and a trust assumption is whether or not it's disclosed and documented, and whether or not the team seeks to conceal it,” he told CoinDesk. According to the Nomad founder, LayerZero publicly denied in a Uniswap forum discussion that it had any sort of special capabilities.  “Because they have publicly denied this capability, we believe they may be deliberately concealing the extent of their control over applications,” Prestwich originally tweeted.  LayerZero’s code auditor, Zellic, tweeted on Monday that the team “has been very upfront about the security properties of the system, and this is all widely known and well documented.”  Prestwich suggested there is a potential conflict of interest because the auditors are paid by the project.  “If you ask any person on Twitter, ‘Can LayerZero steal all Stargate funds?’ The answer would be no. The auditors and LayerZero are coming out and saying everybody always knew we could steal the money. That is not a defense and is also not true,” he told CoinDesk.  As for why he decided to disclose the “backdoor” in LayerZero’s code, Prestwich said in his blog post, “We have chosen to fully disclose because we believe that LayerZero is aware of these issues, and public disclosure is the best way to prompt app developers to set configuration.”  Pellegrino suggested Prestwich’s motives were more nefarious and tied to an upcoming Uniswap governance vote, which will see the community behind the largest decentralized exchange select an official bridge provider. The lead contenders in the vote are LayerZero and Wormhole, another major bridge service.  “What we have heard is that every competitor right now is extremely excited because if LayerZero wins this, we basically maintain a clear front-runner position, whereas if Wormhole wins it then there's no clear front-runner,” Pellegrino explained to CoinDesk.  Prestwich denies that he was motivated to disparage LayerZero as one of its competitors. “I think it's difficult to describe Nomad as a competitor to anyone given the situation that we are in,” he told CoinDesk. As a result of last summer’s hack, “We haven't run a bridge or a cross-chain messaging protocol in about six months.”  Prestwich told CoinDesk that a Uniswap voter asked that he audit LayerZero's code ""as a disinterested third party"" given his extensive background in cross-chain bridge technology and the solidity programming language. Prestwich said the person who requested the audit did not work for Uniswap, but he refused to comment on whether the person was associated with Wormhole.  Prestwich said he did not receive payment for his research and did not show it to anyone other than LayerZero prior to publication.

Related Reading: Dogecoin Surges 6% After Elon Musk Unveils Crypto Payment Master Plan Gala Games’ Strategy Per a report shared on January 29, the objective of the platform this year is to continue supporting the broader gaming ecosystem, move to mobile, and carve out market share while anchoring its strategy on four key pillars, touching on sharing updates, conquering mobile, protecting utility, and remaining visible. Gala Games has specified that all games within its ecosystem will use GALA as the primary token. GALA is the native currency of the gaming portal and gifts users to vote on proposals. The platform leverages blockchain technology and aims to lead in the sphere. Over the months, including in 2022, when gaming activities contracted due to an extended bear market that saw crypto assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum more than half from their 2021 peaks, Gala Games continued to strike valuable partnerships. To build on this base, Gala Games is setting aside over $300 million to support projects in the gaming ecosystem. Out of this amount, the platform has deployed 50% of the amount. They revealed that they are still working with, among others, Gamedia, Artic 7, and Shiver Entertainment. Besides partnering with external game developers, Gala Games works with their internal game developers. Subsequently, the platform updated the community that they plan to re-launch Town Star in partnership with “The Walking Dead Empires.” In the same vein, several gaming titles will be launched in 2023 and 2024. Move to Mobile This year, Gala Games added, they expect more intellectual property holders to join their growing ecosystem. Some of them include PokeGo and AMC. On January 23, Gala Games announced the acquisition of Ember Entertainment and its gaming portfolio comprising over 15 games. Together, these games have been downloaded over 20 million times since deployment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Volatility Ahead?

Behind the scenes, according to people familiar with the matter, there were also disagreements – ahem, friction – among the project’s founders.  The team announced the shutdown in a blog post: “Costs have outpaced revenue,” Friktion said.

According to the blog post, the volts are 96% off their highs, and have now been put into withdrawal-only mode.

Both he and CEO Uddhav Marwaha told CoinDesk in separate messages: “This is a joint decision made by our leadership team and is driven by the economics of the project.”  A key contributing factor, according to several people briefed on the matter, was the founders differed on how to proceed with Friktion’s product road map.

42421978,hkpwiFmxYEifjUax0eQyhc,1675105195,Secret Blockchain Suffers Departures as Foundation Head's $2M-Plus Dividend Sparks Outcry,"Secret Network, a privacy-focused blockchain, has seen a growing number of validators halt their services, after the head of an affiliated foundation took out more than $2 million in dividends and an upgrade led to technical problems.  At least four major validators say they have halted services, including Smart Stake, Kingnodes, Azul Collection and Domerium Labs.  The trend could spell trouble for Secret Network should others follow.  Smart Stake was the latest company to stop validating Secret Network, posting a tweet over the weekend that cited “recent events” as a main reason for leaving.  Late last week, Guy Zyskind, Secret Network’s founder, who leads the development of the network’s core technology as the CEO of SCRT Labs, alleged on a project forum that the Secret Foundation’s founder, Tor Bair, made an undisclosed sale of foundation funds and directed some of the proceeds to himself as a kind of dividend payment.  “Secret Foundation sold a substantial amount of USD worth of SCRT,” Zyskind wrote in the post. The project’s SCRT tokens have a market capitalization around $124 million, according to CoinMarketCap. “Tor cashed out a significant portion of these proceeds (to the best of our understanding, a figure in the low-to-mid seven figures) as a dividend.”  Zyskind continued, “There are potentially other unreported financial irregularities, such as an open loan to Alameda or one of its affiliates by the Secret Foundation. To the best of our knowledge, the loan or its lack of repayment have not been disclosed to the community in any of the reports.” Alameda refers to Alameda Research, the bankrupt crypto trading firm that was embroiled in the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX crypto exchange.  Zyskind recommended that the Secret Foundation be re-established as an organization “that operates as advertised, and as a network of Secret’s magnitude deserves.”  Foundation head claims he was owed  The Secret Foundation was set up to provide grant funding and other resources to projects that run within the Secret Network ecosystem, but it started to face heightened scrutiny last year after revelations that it was incorporated as a for-profit entity despite previously representing itself as a nonprofit. That led to calls from the Secret community for greater transparency surrounding the foundation’s operations and its use of community funds.  Bair defended himself in his own forum post, which he published an hour after Zyskind’s. In the post, Bair claimed that the withdrawn foundation tokens were owed to him as a part of his SCRT vesting schedule.  “Instead of paying out my vested tokens in December 2021, I converted my vested portion of tokens to USD at the OTC price and Secret Foundation distributed these funds as a dividend,” Bair wrote. OTC stands for over-the-counter, referring to the off-exchange market price. “The amount of tokens vested was 375,000 SCRT. The amount of the dividend distribution was $2.625M, which is the OTC price of $7 multiplied by the tokens vested.”  While he acknowledged the need for more transparency, Bair did not address whether the Secret Foundation has any outstanding loans to Alameda.  Bair did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  'Problematic' upgrade  Smart Stake, for its part, said that politics at the Secret Foundation wasn't the determining factor in its decision to stop validating the chain. “Many projects have all kinds of issues and they sail through the tough times and recover from it,” a representative for Smart Stake wrote in a message to CoinDesk. “The Secret Network community is raising the right questions. Most of the core team members are still trusted.”  The decision to leave Secret stemmed primarily from issues with the network’s core technology, the representative said.  “Recently, a firmware upgrade from Intel was mandatory but problematic to achieve for many validators on time, and it resulted in fairly stressful times for several validators,” the Smart Stake representative said. “Couple of validators ended their validator in the last month, and it was a decision Smart Stake was assessing as well at the time.”  Azul, Domerium and Kingnodes all halted their Secret validator operations prior to the most recent Secret Foundation controversy. Domerium, like Smart Stake, cited problems with the handling of a recent upgrade.  Azul said that it was shifting focus to the “application layer” of the chain. Kingnodes cited problems with validator profitability.  In a tweet responding to an earlier version of this article, Zyskind remarked that the validator departures are of minor concern for Secret in the long term. ""A single validator with 0.6% of voting power left yesterday (which happens). The others are also marginal and left for the technical requirements to run a node,"" he said.  ""Secret requires more technical chops to run and if you're not proficient you're probably running at a premium which in this market may make some people give up,"" Zyskind added.  The validator departures are the latest sign of potential trouble for the Secret Network, which in November disclosed that it was forced to patch a critical security vulnerability that could have been used to decrypt private user transaction data.

Token unlocks, which are usually considered bearish events, appear to be having little effect on the price of The Sandbox’s SAND token in the lead-up to releasing more supply. The project will be releasing 12% of the token’s supply, equivalent to around $273 million worth of SAND, to seed and strategic investors, according to Token Unlock, with half of the 12% going to investors, according to a report from Kaiko Research.  SAND is the utility token used on The Sandbox’s ecosystem as the basis for transactions and interactions. Its price has increased 90% since the start of the year and is now trading at 74 cents, according to data from Messari. Notably, however, the token is still 90% down from its all-time high of $8 reached in November 2021.  Token unlocks refer to the process of releasing tokens blocked under the terms of the project's funding rounds or fundraising efforts. They have often been considered bearish events, given that they release more supply of the asset into the market. However, more recently, unlocks seem to have undergone a change in narrative, with tokens that have upcoming unlocks rallying ahead of them. Rallies in tokens such as aptos (APT) and axie infinity (AXS) ahead of recent unlocks are two examples.  “The thing to watch with unlocks is [percentage] to investors: if [around] 50% expect heavy sell pressure,” wrote Conor Ryder, a research analyst at Kaiko Research. In a report looking at The Sandbox’s previous token unlocks and price movement, Ryder concluded the token allocation for this upcoming unlock is similar to the August 14 one, so there will be similar underperformance for SAND as sell pressure picks up.  “The day after the unlock on August 14, nearly 75% of all significant trades were sell orders as investors looked to cash out of SAND. That sell pressure continued in the days after the unlock as sell orders dominated buys,” wrote Ryder.  “The allocation of SAND unlocks is skewed towards investors and the token performance has suffered during unlocks as a result,” he added.  The Sandbox has an unlock schedule that is due every six months until 2025 with the same allocation to investors. Therefore, SAND holders could look to face serious headwinds until then, according to Ryder.",POSITIVE,AXS | SAND | APT,AXS | BUSINESS | SAND | TRADING | APT,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/30/sandboxs-sand-surges-90-since-start-of-year-ahead-of-token-unlock,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c98e52e9184695c256d7cf73f583722a4a809e0d-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421389,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnzcj,1675102515,Code vs. Values: The Crypto Twist on ‘Trust’,"We hear the term “trustless” thrown around a lot in crypto, and many are confused by its implications. It is a vague term with several potential meanings, depending on the context. “Directionless” means “without direction,” so “trustless” must mean “without trust,” right? Surely an absence of trust is bad?  It turns out that “trustless” is yet another term that the crypto ecosystem has appropriated and imbued with an altered definition, to refer to the lack of the need for trust. In traditional finance we trust our banks to make our payments and safeguard our deposits and we trust our brokers to execute our buy/sell requests.  Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.  In crypto, in theory, we don’t need to trust any third parties. We can directly transact peer to peer, leaving the code to handle the balance adjustments and verify on-chain that all is in order.  This is not an absence of trust – it is an environment in which trust is not needed.  In theory, anyway. Peeling away layers, we still have to trust the blockchain as well as the interface we use; we even have to trust the miners and/or validators maintaining the network. And in buying our crypto assets from a centralized exchange or storing it with a centralized custodian, we are trusting middlemen to handle our funds fairly (unfortunately not always the case, as we have seen). If we use a decentralized app, we trust the code has no bugs (also not always the case).  How do we evaluate ‘trust’?  Like the air we breathe, our lives are fueled by trust, even in “trustless” systems. Our society doesn’t work without it and nor will it, no matter how decentralized we get. Trust is why contracts work, empires fall and people seek community.  It is also why the annual ""Edelman Trust Barometer,"" published every January, makes such compelling reading. Since 2000 it has been documenting the decline of trust in our society by canvassing 32,000 people across 28 countries, to gauge attitudes toward the institutions that shape the framework of our lives.  This year, the main theme is growing polarization, with respondents in the U.S., Argentina, Spain and others overwhelmingly checking the “extremely divided and no solution in sight” box. One of the principal drivers of this shift is the declining trust in government (seen as “unethical and incompetent”) and media (seen as “biased and misleading”).  “Business” comes across as the only trusted pillar of our society. This year’s report highlights the growing expectations the public has of CEOs. A resounding 89% of respondents expect them to take more of a stand on the treatment of employees, 82% on climate change, 80% on discrimination.  Rather than offer relief that at least one key group of institutions is still trusted, this raises many concerns. What is the purpose of business – to make profits for investors or to advocate for certain values? How political should business become, and to what extent could this hurt its growth potential?  This shift in expectations resurfaces something I touched on earlier. We can’t suppress the need for trust in our lives, and when it is damaged in one area we look for compensation in another. But expecting businesses to step into the role of societal governance and dissemination of “truth” could end up distorting markets.  A different trust model for crypto investing  Which brings us to crypto: An easy assumption is that crypto runs on cold code rather than warm people and therefore delivers a “purer” market experience. This may be the case (no corporate decisions impacting earnings potential, leaving investors to focus on design choices), but code – especially in crypto – does embody values.  Satoshi didn’t create Bitcoin to fill a void in the world’s trust map. He (or she or they; I’ll use “he” for convenience) created Bitcoin to fill a void in his trust map, expecting that other like-minded individuals would find it interesting. Bitcoin has no leaders to shape it into what its market wants, nor a marketing department to help identify what that is. Bitcoin didn’t go looking for users – its ecosystem spontaneously emerged among people who value what its code can do, and has grown as more and more people question established market and money orthodoxies.  An often-misunderstood premise of Bitcoin and similar crypto networks is that they’re code written to perform a function that makes them a tool, and tools have many uses, good and bad. Bitcoin, for example, may have been created with certain values in mind but that doesn’t stop it from being used by those that don’t share those values.  This matters for investor expectations. Investing in crypto is akin to investing in tools, which makes crypto much more like a commodity market driven by supply and demand than a securities market driven by corporate strategy and soft goals. Yet, unlike commodities, crypto assets also embody certain characteristics that put them in the path of the “values investing” crowd, which the Edelman study showed is even larger than most of us realized. No one has ever accused copper of having values.  It also matters in terms of regulatory assessment, surfacing a heated debate with which many in crypto are all too familiar: Should you regulate a tool or only its uses? Knives can make food easier to eat and they can kill, yet no politician is advocating for the regulation of knife sales. However, Bitcoin (to choose an obvious example) was born with embedded anti-regulation sentiment. That warrants some concern on the part of those who see their influence waning.  All this highlights just how new crypto concepts still are and how we have barely scratched the surface in terms of their impact on the way we see concepts such as markets, regulation and trust. It’s about so much more than understanding algorithms, data structures, securities law or economic incentives.  But it is worth questioning our trust in a report about trust, especially when a PR firm that caters to corporations tells us that corporations are more trusted than other areas of our societal framework. Whether the report’s conclusion is biased or not, probing neatly packaged narratives is a healthy exercise.  Perhaps this is the ultimate utility of the crypto ecosystem. While it continues to test use cases and expand into new market segments, it has given us more than a means to route around selective barriers and a window into a new economic hierarchy. It has also given us a lens through which to question established conventions.  As the Edelman report suggests, “values” and “trust” are important – it just may turn out, however, that we don’t understand them as well as we thought, and that the new tools in the philosophical box will nudge us to think about what they mean for us as individuals and communities. This could, in turn, lead to a deeper awareness of just how these fundamental concepts can shape the next generation of markets and transactions, and what that means for our connections with each other.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Noelle Acheson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/01/30/code-vs-values-the-crypto-twist-on-trust,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b2d60be774c58b2a0476102739c499c9d9167fbe-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The company has submitted petitions for regulatory licenses in the United States to “turnaround the business.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Volatility Ahead? Open Interest Registers Sharp Jump Last year, Musk acquired Twitter in a multi-billion-dollar deal. Since then, many advertisers have left the platform, negatively impacting the company’s revenue stream. The new CEO launched a subscription service and continues to seek an alternative to mitigate the company’s financial problems. In that sense, the social network is focused on enabling payments on its platform under the leadership of Esther Crawford, the Financial Times claims. These efforts are a “critical” element of a larger strategy to bolster the company’s revenue streams. Peer-To-Peer Payments With Dogecoin? The report claims that Elon Musk has publicly revealed his plans to roll out peer-to-peer transactions with bank accounts and debit cards on the network. These features are part of a “master plan” to build the “everything app,” as the report calls it. Like other social networks where users can message their contacts, shop, and make payments, Twitter would expand beyond its current services. In this context, cryptocurrencies could play a big role. Elon Musk is a big Dogecoin proponent, and any plans to incorporate payments on Twitter include the meme coin naturally. At least, this is the market’s perception of recent events. As of this writing, Dogecoin (DOGE) saw a 5% spike in its price action but has been unable to break above critical resistance. The meme coin follows the general sentiment in the market, recording losses during today’s trading session. A Twitter “super app” with Dogecoin payments could usher in a new adoption era for the cryptocurrency and potentially allow it to reclaim previously lost territory. DOGE recorded an all-time high in 2021 on the back of a campaign in its favor spearheaded by Elon Musk and other personalities. Twitter’s Master Strategy Furthermore, the FT report claims that Twitter already filed a registration as a payments processor with the U.S. Treasury. This application suggests that, if approved, the Twitter “super app” could materialize sooner than expected. The company is in pursuit of additional licenses, which will be “filed shortly,” according to the report. This stage precedes an international strategy to obtain the necessary licenses to take Twitter to the next level.

By comparison, the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index was down roughly 27% for the year. Pantera’s fund has partly rebounded this month with a gain of over 47%, according to a January investor call uploaded to YouTube.  The Pantera Liquid Token Fund is a “multi-strategy vehicle that typically invests in 15-25 liquid tokens at any point in time” and is “predominantly driven by a discretionary strategy focused on decentralized-finance and adjacent assets,” according to the firm’s website. The fund had $198 million in assets under management and 13 tokens in the portfolio at the time of the investor call.  The fund started to navigate much of the portfolio away from altcoins and into ether (ETH) in the late spring, Joey Krug, co-chief investment officer at Pantera, said on the call. The timing would have matched up with the collapse of Terra’s USDT stablecoin and sister coin luna, which triggered the collapse of lender Celsius Network.  The fund’s top three performers for the hard-hit November period were Cosmos' ATOM token, Chainlink's LINK and Optimism's OP, while Uniswap's UNI, Solana's SOL and ether took the bottom slots, according to the call presentation. Pantera had a position in solana and sold “a lot of it” right after the FTX troubles hit the news, selling in the $20 range and exiting before the token dropped down to the $10 range, Krug said.  Optimism, a layer 2 scaling tool, has become one of the fund’s largest non-ETH positions, and was a driver of year-to-date growth alongside ether and UNI  “I think we’re just starting now, recently, to start to rotate back into some alts that we think are going to outperform ETH over the coming cycle,” Krug added.

Boldstart Ventures and IBI Tech Fund led the round, with additional investments from Nexo, Blockdaemon, Borderless, Alchemy, and CMT Digital, among others. The capital will support the firm’s goals to provide a “proactive security and risk prevention platform” for Web 3 companies, decentralized finance protocols and other players in the crypto world, according to Hyperative co-founder and CEO Gal Sagie.  Sagie and fellow co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Dan Caspi said they want to leverage what they’ve learned at top tech companies to assuage the fears of business leaders who struggle to accurately assess security risks in vulnerable spaces like crypto and Web3 and lose out on lucrative business opportunities as a result.  ""We saw people falling into phishing and scamming campaigns [and] we saw reputable organizations not entering the field and not sending or investing money because they're afraid of reputation risk, and how to monitor and understand risk,” Sagie told Coindesk.  The fear of phishing attacks and other scams are not entirely unfounded. Roughly $4 billion worth of cryptocurrencies was lost to rug pulls, fraud, exploits and other scams in 2022, according to a report by security risks platform Immunefi.  It's losses like those that inspired the Hypernative team in September to launch its first product, Pre-Cog, a platform that flags potential threats before they occur by monitoring on- and off-chain data sources. The product has already prevented the loss of tens of millions of dollars to date, Sagie said.  The company will also use the new funding to launch more offerings that will rely on historical databases, machine learning models and heuristics to ascertain and generate alerts for potential incidents minutes or hours before they occur. It hopes to allow market makers, asset managers, traders to make more proactive decisions about their businesses and clients’ safety.  “What we see is that the market is very reactive in nature,” Sagie said. “When there is something going wrong businesses focus on how you handle it post-incident, but preventing these things from happening is a very important aspect [of remaining secure].”  Read More: This Was the Worst Year for Crypto Hacks.

The round was led by Haun Ventures with participation from Maven 11, 1KX, Robot Ventures and Plaintext Capital. The fundraise puts the company’s valuation in the “eight-figure” range, according to a spokesperson for the project. Sovereign Labs declined to disclose its exact valuation.  Sovereign Labs is building a software development kit (SDK) that makes it easier for developers to create interoperable zero-knowledge rollups. A rollup is a special type of blockchain that derives some of its security from another blockchain, thereby allowing for scalability without sacrificing security.  The new Sovereign SDK is designed to be interoperable, scalable and able to be seamlessly deployed on any layer 1 blockchain.  “We’re actually completely agnostic on the blockchain our rollup rolls on,” said Cem Ozer, co-founder and CEO of Sovereign Labs, who added that rollups built with the Sovereign SDK will be compatible with any layer 1 blockchain.  Rollups powered by zero-knowledge, or zk, proofs use a type of cryptography that can prove the validity of a statement without the need to reveal the underlying information. Recently, the buzzy sector has also been attracting ample venture funding, as well as serving as a core component for existing crypto projects like zkSync, Starknet, Zcash and Mina.  “Building with zero-knowledge has historically been accessible only to a few PhDs in cryptography,” said Preston Evans, the company’s co-founder and chief technology officer, in a statement. “At Sovereign Labs we’re building tools which are accessible to normal developers.”  Read More: What Are Rollups? ZK Rollups and Optimistic Rollups Explained  Ozer and Evans added that Sovereign Labs did not have plans to launch a token, adding they are “100% focused” on building out the SDK framework.  “From our perspective, the other systems (like subnets or bridges) all lose the core trait of blockchains, which is end-user verification,” said Ozer. “If we lose that, we might as well have built these systems on [Amazon Web Services].”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | TECHNOLOGY | ZEC | ZK,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/01/30/blockchain-scaling-project-sovereign-labs-raises-74-million-in-seed-round,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2603cd3b3498f41e43650baa2356a1bef63f9b09-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42413017,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7LR2,1675097747,BlockFi's Crypto Mining Assets May Be Headed to Market After Bankruptcy Hearing,"Failed crypto lender BlockFi appears on track to sell some assets after a bankruptcy judge in New Jersey expressed approval of the plan as part of Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings designed to restore funds to creditors.  Under a proposal put to the bankruptcy court on Monday, bidders for BlockFi's crypto mining assets would have until Feb. 20 to submit bids, with an auction the following week.  “I think it's a workable and certainly an expeditious and efficient process that's contemplated,” Judge Michael Kaplan said, after the U.S. government and a committee representing creditors withdrew their objections. “We'll all keep our fingers crossed that it produces significant results.”  The sale would be the first in a number of potential auctions, BlockFi’s attorneys told the court.  “We've received substantial interest in the market for certain asset packages and we expect to receive even more bids going forward,” Francis Petrie of law firm Kirkland & Ellis said after a Jan. 9 legal filing cited 35 potential counterparties. “Given the practical realities of the debtors’ circumstances, and the current volatility in the cryptocurrency market, we need to act quickly to preserve the value of our assets.""  Robinhood  BlockFi’s attempts to get its hands on hundreds of millions of dollars worth of stocks in Robinhood Markets (HOOD), however, have taken a further turn following parallel legal proceedings in Antigua, the New Jersey court was told.  “On January 27, the court in Antigua granted Sam Bankman-Fried's motion to stay the liquidation proceedings,” said Richard Kanowitz of Haynes Boone, also representing BlockFi. “They granted leave to appeal, which he must file within 21 days.”  The 56 million shares, with a current value of around $577 million, are the subject of a complex tussle involving BlockFi, failed crypto exchange FTX, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, the Antigua-based liquidators of the shell company that nominally owned the shares and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).  According to court filings earlier in January, the shares have been seized by the DOJ, which is investigating Bankman-Fried, who has pleaded not guilty to charges including wire fraud. Bankman-Fried has also said he was willing to give the shares to FTX customers, though in court he opposed a related bid by FTX to claim ownership.  Dependent on FTX for a $400 million line of credit, BlockFi filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Nov. 28, shortly after FTX did the same. On Friday, Kaplan approved a $10 million BlockFi bonus pot intended to keep staffers from leaving the company.

42421393,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnzjx,1675097675,Artists Weigh In on the Battle Over NFT Creator Royalties,"In June 2021, during my first-ever interview with a prominent non-fungible token (NFT) collector, I learned about a Web3 silver bullet. As a freshly self-employed writer who left a salaried media job to pursue a freelance career, scarcity was on my mind.  I wasn’t preoccupied with the “good” kind of scarcity we talk about in Web3 (the kind that makes digital art more valuable due to a limited supply). I was, instead, concerned about the scarcity of resources available to creatives to protect their intellectual property (IP) – this includes writers like me who continuously generate new ideas for corporate entities that can then repackage, repurpose, republish and resell creative works in as many different forms as they’d like.  I chose self-employment after realizing that companies I’d written for in the past would forever have the right to turn my articles into newsletters, ebooks, social media threads, digital courses and more, yet I would never be entitled to additional compensation other than my fixed salary once that work was completed.  In a traditional creative industry, it often doesn’t matter how much value someone’s creative work generates. And unless you’re familiar with intellectual property designations or can afford skilled lawyers to negotiate on your behalf, artists are usually expected to create while big businesses handle the rest.  I soon learned that Web3 had already considered this dynamic and developed a tool to ensure NFT artists could continue to make revenue from their intellectual property. By utilizing smart contracts, artists could program lifetime royalties into all non-fungible token sales, which would automatically deliver a percentage of their profits to their crypto wallets in perpetuity.  Smart contract-based NFT royalties have been embraced by independent artists as a much-needed protection. But while smart contract-automated NFT royalties are the perfect Web3 antidote to years of creator exploitation, building the infrastructure to execute this vision has led to additional challenges.  The limits of smart contracts  Perpetual creator royalties are great in theory, though there are some logistical holes in enforcing them on-chain.  First, creator royalties are enforced by smart contracts, a type of blockchain-based code that executes instructions of a pre-determined agreement. In this way, smart contracts aren’t technically “smart” — the code is structured as a set of if/then conditions that execute according to specific inputs and triggers. Smart contracts are not a form of artificial intelligence (AI), because they don’t originate any generative outputs; the outcome can only be an option that has been predetermined.  Smart contracts aren’t technically contracts either. Governments aren’t obligated to recognize them as legally binding documents, whereas a contract between two individuals or corporations signed by both parties with lawyers present will always be valid in the eyes of a judge.  Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has even said he regrets giving smart contracts such a strong (and potentially misleading) title. He once said a more accurate description is “persistent scripts.”  Charlotte Kent, an arts writer and professor who wrote in April 2021 of the breakthrough potential of smart contracts, wrote almost a year later of our tendency to glorify them. “There’s a practical foolhardiness in the glorification of a sender/receiver model that eliminates all others, and an amusing foolishness in the assumption that smart contracts have actual legal standing,” wrote Kent.  Creator royalty controversy  Aside from the practical questions about smart contracts and creator royalties, there are the more economically driven issues that have surfaced in recent months. NFT marketplaces made headlines throughout the last quarter of 2022 for proposing to make creator royalties optional on their platforms in an attempt to attract more buyers. In November, a representative from the Solana-based marketplace Magic Eden told CoinDesk that switching to a royalty-optional model was meant to address “collectors’ need for low-fee NFT trades.” Several other marketplaces adopted similar policies to remain competitive.  Meanwhile, OpenSea doubled down on its commitment to royalty payments by blocking NFTs minted on OpenSea from being resold on secondary marketplaces that ban royalties. Skeptics theorized OpenSea’s tool was in actuality a covert attempt to keep all sales on its own platform, but OpenSea co-founder and CEO Devin Finzer responded by saying the move was an attempt to give artists more control over where their art is bought and sold.  “[Creator fees] are decided on a per-marketplace basis,” said Finzer. “Many marketplaces sprung up that decided not to honor creator fees.” In an attempt to circumvent these marketplaces, OpenSea launched a new set of smart contracts with advanced programmability.  Meanwhile, artists became vocal on social media and rallied on behalf of creators’ rights to control their own royalty structures. “We all talk to each other,” said prominent NFT artists and Deadfellaz co-founder Betty in a December 2021 interview with NFT-focused outlet NFT Now. “It came through the grapevine that [optional royalties] was going to happen, and we were all like — we need to act.”  Responses from the community  Many people attribute the no- or optional-royalties trend to low NFT trading volumes during the bear market, suggesting an exploitative, zero-sum mentality that prioritizes profits for centralized NFT marketplaces and speculative investors.  “As for OpenSea's back and forth, the way it has impacted artists like myself is that even though they've recanted their original intention on removing creator royalties to a certain degree, many are reluctant to mint on their platform,” said NFT nature photographer Lori Grace Bailey, who chose to mint a 50-piece edition on Sloika, a platform that Bailey says has “doubled down” on its commitment to protecting creator royalties.  There appears to be an expectation that artists (and loyal collectors) will simply migrate towards more creator-centric platforms. And compared to profile picture (PFP) community founders like Betty, one-of-one artists may feel as though they have less at stake, given that their art tends to circulate less on secondary marketplaces and therefore isn’t expected to generate considerable revenue through royalties.  “Royalties were, of course, one of the many aspects of NFTs that appealed to me,” said painter and NFT artist MJ Ryle. “As a one-of-one artist, it doesn’t impact me much. Primary sales can be challenging enough. Being in a position where royalties of secondary sales are a concern seems like a luxury to me!”  Meanwhile, musicians may have a unique take on royalties, says Steph Guerrero, head of marketing and business development at Legato.  “No other industry was affected by piracy like music was in the early 2000s,” Guerrero said, explaining that royalty payments suffered as streaming and torrent services gained popularity. “Musicians are already fighting for royalties of any use of music independent of Web3, but some big voices in the space are saying that musicians should only be paid through actual NFT sales, and in some cases, royalties only through secondary sales.”  She added that a royalty-optional or no-royalty model will put the onus on musicians to “constantly be creating in order to have revenue.”  What’s next in the creator royalty conversation?  After pushback from the artist community, several NFT marketplaces reversed course on their royalty-optional models.  Artists continue to have opinions about royalties and remain focused on advocating on behalf of creators. A favorite tool among artists is Manifold, a creator studio that provides the capability for code-free minting and customizable smart contract generation that protects royalties.  “I will continue to pursue any and all options, including minting pieces to my own contract via sources like @manifoldxyz, or on platforms that wholeheartedly reinforce their commitment to protecting creator royalties,” Bailey told CoinDesk.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Megan DeMatteo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/01/30/artists-weigh-in-on-the-battle-over-nft-creator-royalties,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6778fe5c3e085904b3fe3d0262454d435f2de576-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42413023,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7LTq,1675090570,Jailed Kickboxer Andrew Tate Promoted Bitcoin for Tax Avoidance in Video,"It’s been all over the news that Andrew Tate, the embattled British-American social media influencer and five-time world kickboxing champion, was arrested in Bucharest, Romania, last month. He is currently sitting in jail with his younger brother and two business partners for alleged human trafficking, sexual assault and forming an organized criminal enterprise.  But now there’s a crypto angle to Tate’s unfolding saga: In an unverified video posted on YouTube earlier this month, the 36-year-old appears to have bragged about using bitcoin (BTC) to avoid paying taxes.  The video shows clips of a brazen Tate – the eighth-most googled person of 2022, according to Google Trends – boastfully admitting to multiple illegal acts, including fraud and tax evasion. The clips were collected and published as part of a legal analysis by popular YouTube personality and criminal lawyer Bruce Rivers.  In the clips, a grandiloquent Tate, clad in a turquoise sweater, proudly details how he used bitcoin to swindle unwitting sex workers and cheat the tax man.  One of Tate’s lawyers in the Romanian case, Eugen Vidineac, told CoinDesk that Tate is currently not facing any tax evasion charges.  “There is no allegation against him on tax evasion,” Vidineac told CoinDesk. “That's not on the list of charges.”  According to a British news site, the former kickboxer claims he made $600,000 monthly from a lucrative online webcam business that employed 75 sex workers globally. In the video posted by Rivers, Tate seems to describe how to use bitcoin to bypass the traditional banking system and evade taxes by taking advantage of Chaturbate – an adult webcam platform with an option for bitcoin payouts to performers.  Read more: Why This Sex Industry Executive Loves Bitcoin  “Another reason to use Chaturbate is because they will pay you in bitcoin,” Tate states in the video. “This is amazing because … trying to get money out of these sites into your bank without paying a [boatload] of tax is actually very difficult … Let's say you generate three, four thousand dollars. Bang! You get bitcoin into your wallet, done. No ... tax … none of that...”  It’s not clear if Tate was suggesting he believed bitcoin payments were not taxable, or that the largest cryptocurrency by market value was useful for avoiding taxation on income. “You're getting paid in bitcoin so you don't need to pay tax to anybody,” Tate said.  His comments point to an inescapable reality that global financial authorities have taken pains to emphasize – that while bitcoin might be one of the great technological innovations of our time, it’s not above the law. Income payments received in BTC are taxable in most jurisdictions.  According to current Internal Revenue Service guidelines, getting paid in bitcoin (BTC) or any other cryptocurrency generally constitutes employment income.  “He thinks just because it doesn't go through a bank it can't be traced and therefore, you can't tax it,” Rivers told CoinDesk in an interview. “But let's say I got 100 chickens for a fee that I didn't report. It was still income. So I’ve got to report that value. I’ve got to pay tax on those chickens.”  The IRS guidelines state that remuneration can be in various forms but it’s the fair market value of that remuneration that matters.  Of course, Tate may have been referring to activities outside of the U.S., but his dual British-American citizenship might still expose him to tax liability.  “What Andrew is trying to say is that crypto transactions are anonymous and the tax authorities will not be able to find them. Wrong on many counts,” Charles Kolstad told CoinDesk. Kolstad is an international tax lawyer at Withers Bergman LLP. “The IRS, the tax authorities in the [European Union] and elsewhere may be slow but they are not stupid. The tax authorities have blockchain analytic tracking software and will find you eventually. The IRS, the EU and members of the OECD are all focused on tax evasion through the use of crypto.”  Several online crypto sleuths claim to have identified bitcoin wallets belonging to Tate. One YouTuber recorded an exposé insisting he had found bitcoin and ether wallets for Tate’s “War Room” – an online membership program with a hefty $5,000 price tag.  Earlier this month, crypto news site Protos also claimed to have found one of Tate’s bitcoin wallets. Blockchain data shows the wallet currently has about 8 BTC, but has received over 114 BTC (roughly $2.6 million) since August 2021. Funds have been transferred out over time and the most recent withdrawal of roughly 6.5 BTC was made on Dec. 12, 2022.  According to Forbes, Tate has been living in Romania since 2017. One Romanian legal expert told CoinDesk that Romania doesn’t have laws that specifically address cryptocurrency.  “Romania is very far behind other countries” when it comes to the adoption of cryptocurrency and creating a legal framework for blockchain-based payments, Stefan Loredan told CoinDesk in an interview. Loredan is a Romanian lawyer and CEO of Onelink Solutions, a legal advisory firm. “We are so far behind. I think it will happen in the next 10, 15, 20 years. But as of now, there's no regulations and there's no laws which involve crypto.”  According to Loredan, who’s discussed Tate’s legal woes on several television news shows, the controversial influencer may not be in the clear just yet in terms of any legal exposure to tax evasion or money laundering.  “During the trial some charges can drop, but also other charges can be added,” Loredan explained. “For example, if after the prosecutor goes through his phone and there's further evidence, he might be subject to charges of money laundering or whatever else.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/01/30/jailed-kickboxer-andrew-tate-promoted-bitcoin-for-tax-avoidance-in-video,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/637256312ac3b8f99309efeeca6e37bf4d03f087-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42413011,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7LQ6,1675090307,Crypto India Looks for Relief but Holds Out Little Hope in Budget Speech,"India is unlikely to change its restrictive crypto tax rules when Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman unveils the country’s new budget on Wednesday, CoinDesk has learned.  The nation’s budget indicates how government resources are allocated and the latest tax rules. Last year, this included stiff taxes on crypto transactions: a 30% tax on profits and a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) on all transactions for the crypto sector, prompting an uproar from the industry.  Crypto trading volumes plummeted almost immediately, Indians moved more than$3.8 billion in trading volume from local to international crypto exchanges in the nine months after the announcement and interest in crypto nosedived.  Industry hopes  The primary demand from the industry and recommendation from policy think tanks is to reduce the TDS to 0.01%, or at minimum to 0.1%.  R. Venkatesh, the head of public policy at CoinSwitch Kuber, said there is a “mismatch between the intent and the actual impact of the TDS with 1% of the capital locked up at every sell transaction.”  The tax is pushing crypto users offshore, undermining the stated government objective of tracing transactions.  Other suggestions include establishing progressive taxes on gains instead of the flat 30% tax, allowing losses to offset gains, and carrying out economic analysis to understand the optimal taxation structure.  The Bharat Web 3 Association, a policy body representing the Indian crypto industry, shared these demands with the government during a presentation.  Tax cut unlikely  Several individuals closely working in the crypto regulatory space have publicly said they are hopeful for a tax cut but privately opined that it is unlikely.  Rajat Mittal, a crypto tax counsel in India's Supreme Court, said he didn’t expect a tax cut but hoped for it so that investors “are not forced to move assets abroad and tax leakage can be stopped.”  Policy experts such as Subhash Garg, a former secretary in the Finance Ministry’s Department of Economic Affairs and Meghna Bal, a fellow at the Esya Centre said that while reasons for a tax cut exist, the nation has other priorities.  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has stated that crypto regulation cannot succeed without global coordination. This view was echoed by Sitharaman when India assumed the G20 presidency, where she said determining how to regulate crypto will be one of India’s priorities.  “How can India propose changes or new rules when it has publicly stated the need for global coordination that it’s discussing at ongoing G-20 meetings which will only end in September,” said a person familiar with India’s G-20 work.  India has kept a crypto bill in cold storage since early last year.  Digital rupee  It’s unclear whether India will mention its ongoing work around its central bank digital currency (CBDC), the retail version of which it expects to roll out fully by December.

Follow CoinDesk Brasil on Twitter.  Binance has launched a prepaid crypto card in Brazil in partnership with Mastercard, the crypto exchange said Monday.  The card will be available to all Binance users in Brazil with a valid national ID and allow them to make payments and pay bills with 13 cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, ether and Binance USD, according to a blog post. Binance’s card will charge a 0.9% fee per transaction involving crypto, Binance said, adding that it will offer up to 8% in cashback with crypto and allow ATM withdrawals without fees.  The product is now in a testing phase and “will be widely available in the coming weeks,” a Binance spokesperson told CoinDesk.  “Brazil is an extremely relevant market for Binance and we will continue to invest in new services for local users, as well as contribute to the development of blockchain and the crypto ecosystem in the country,” Guilherme Nazar, general manager of Binance Brazil, said in a press release. Brazil is one of Binance's top 10 markets globally, according to its post.  Binance cited a Mastercard study conducted in 2022 showing that 49% of Brazilian consumers claimed to have made at least one transaction using crypto in the past 12 months, compared to a global average of 41%.  Binance launched its card in Brazil after making a similar announcement in Argentina in August, also in partnership with Mastercard. The company rolled out a similar offering in the European Economic Area in August 2020.  “Brazilians are eager to use cryptocurrency beyond an investment asset,” Marcelo Tangioni, president of Mastercard in Brazil, said in the press release.

Bitcoin Open Interest Has Made A Huge Jump Of 8.3% Over Past Day As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, this increase in open interest is the largest observed during the past three months. The “open interest” is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin futures contracts that are currently open on derivative exchanges. The metric accounts for both short and long contracts. When the value of this metric goes up, it means users are opening new positions on the futures market right now. As leverage usually goes up with investors opening new contracts, this kind of trend can lead to the price of the crypto becoming more volatile. On the other hand, decreasing values of the indicator imply investors are closing up their positions at the moment. Especially sharp drawdowns suggest mass liquidations have just taken place in the market. Naturally, when the open interest comes down to low enough values, the price tends to become more stable as there isn’t much leverage present anymore. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the daily percentage change of the Bitcoin open interest over the last few months: Looks like the value of the metric has been quite high over the past day | Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin open interest seems to have gone through a very large positive change recently. In this spike, the indicator’s value increased by $700 million, which represented a percentage change of 8.3%, the highest observed during the last three months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Touches New ATH Following 4.68% Adjustment This could signal that volatility may be coming soon for the crypto. However, it’s currently unclear in which direction this new volatility might end up taking the price in. From the chart, it’s apparent that earlier during the current Bitcoin rally, the open interest saw a large spike (obviously smaller than the current one), and only a day later, a sharp negative spike was seen as Bitcoin’s price rapidly climbed. This means that the price increase then was fueled by a short squeeze. A “squeeze” takes place when mass liquidations take place at once due to a sharp move in the price. Such liquidations only amplify the price move further, leading to even more positions being liquidated. In this way, liquidations can cascade together during a squeeze event. Squeezes are the reason why high open interest periods generally introduce more volatility to the price. It would appear that when the rally started, a large number of investors opened short positions, believing that the price increase wouldn’t last too long. But as their bet failed, their positions being liquidated only fueled the rally further. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Reach Highest Value Since FTX Crash, Bullish? It now remains to be seen whether a similar event will also follow this open interest increase, or if a long squeeze will occur this time instead.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency has since retreated to around $23,200. Since the start of the year, bitcoin has gained 40%. Ether is up 30% on the year. “Though the move was clearly led by above normal volumes in bitcoin, this weekend’s rally has been a shared rally with many altcoins putting in some healthy numbers,” said Laurent Kssis, crypto trading adviser at CEC Capital. “A correction and profit-taking should not be dismissed at these levels pushing down below 23K.” Additionally, the Fear and Greed Index, a metric designed to gauge the market sentiment of cryptocurrency at any given time, has flipped to “greed” from reading “neutral” as of Sunday.  Lawyers for Sam Bankman-Fried have argued he should be allowed access to assets and crypto held by his former company FTX, saying there's no evidence he's responsible for previous alleged unauthorized transactions. Bankman-Fried, who resigned as FTX's CEO in November when the crypto exchange filed for bankruptcy, is free from jail on bail as he faces multiple federal criminal charges, including conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. As part of his bail conditions, Bankman-Fried was prohibited from accessing cryptocurrency held by FTX and its affiliated trading arm, Alameda Research, after the government pointed to illicit transfers made from Alameda wallets. The bar includes crypto purchased with FTX or Alameda that Bankman-Fried didn't access or transfer, Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried's lawyer, wrote in a letter to U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, the presiding judge in FTX's bankruptcy case, that was dated Saturday.  South Korea’s Ministry of Justice plans to start tracking crypto transactions as it looks to crack down on money laundering, it said in a report Thursday. The ministry will initially use third-party software to monitor transaction history, extract information on transactions and check the source of funds. It plans to develop its own system, which should be ready in the second half of the year. South Korean police signed an agreement last October with domestic crypto exchanges Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Corbit and Gopax, pledging cooperation in criminal investigations involving crypto. Bithumb is under investigation for tax evasion and price manipulation.  Chart of the Day  The chart on the left shows that gold bottomed out in early November and turned higher after that, leading bitcoin's bull revival by nearly two months.  The yellow metal's rally has stalled in the past few days, a cause for concern for the cryptocurrency bulls, according to Singapore-based QCP Capital.  ""For gold, the $1,890-$1,900 support level is key. Gold should keep above this level for the crypto uptrend to hold,"" QCP Capital said in a market update published Friday.  ""Besides equities, gold and USD price action have also been leading/driving crypto prices. What worries us here is that the USD is starting to show massive positive divergence,"" QCP added.

42413009,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7LKU,1675083387,Crypto Exchange Gemini Emphasized FDIC Insurance in Communications With Earn Customers: Report,"CORRECTION (Jan. 30, 18:26 UTC): An earlier version of this article incorrectly drew the conclusion that Gemini is being investigated by the New York Department of Financial Services specifically for misrepresenting that its EARN accounts were backed by the FDIC.  Cryptocurrency exchange Gemini reportedly implied to customers that their assets in its interesting-bearing Earn product were safe because they were backed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC), Axios reported on Monday.  According to the report, Gemini's discussions with customers referred to the FDIC, but appeared to be in reference to the firm's deposits at other banks, as opposed to its own products, a distinction which customers did not seem to understand.  It is against the law for a financial firm to imply that an uninsured product is FDIC-insured.  The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) is investigating Gemini, according to the Axios report.  Gemini had not responded to CoinDesk's request for an official comment on the matter at press time.  The exchange halted withdrawals from its Earn product in November last year amid the fallout from the collapse of fellow exchange FTX.  Around $900 million is estimated to be frozen on the platform as a result. Gemini blamed the halt on a similar freeze at the now-bankrupt crypto lender Genesis, where Gemini has invested its customers' funds. Genesis and CoinDesk are both owned by crypto conglomerate Digital Currency Group.  The FDIC and the NYDFS both declined to comment.

42413022,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7LUm,1675081246,Premier League Inks Deal With Digital Trading Card Platform Sorare,"The English Premier League has linked up with digital trading card company Sorare to expand its non-fungible token (NFT) offerings.  The deal between the English soccer league and the NFT-based fantasy sports game allows NFT purchasers to build their own teams and compete in a fantasy version of the competition, Sorare said in a blog post on Monday. The deal will last for four years and is worth a total of 120 million British pounds ($150 million), CityAM reported.  Sorare offers a free-to-play competition that allows its 3 million users to compete by collecting soccer players in the form of non-fungible tokens. These NFTs are then submitted into a fantasy team that generate rewards based on real-world performances. The platform also has a competition where users can purchase limited NFTs for cryptocurrency to generate higher rewards, those NFTs can also be traded with other users.  The company raised $680 million in a Series B round with a valuation of $4.3 billion in September, attracting investment from SoftBank Vision Fund and LionTree among others.  The Premier League joins more than 280 global soccer organizations and all 30 Major League Baseball teams on the Paris-based platform.  ""Sorare's digital cards and innovative online game represent a new way for fans to feel closer to the Premier League whether they are watching in the stadium or from around the world,"" said Premier League CEO Richard Masters in a statement.  In October Sky News said the Premier League planned to hold talks with its 20 clubs to discuss a multiyear deal with Sorare. Sources told the outlet that the league had previously been on the verge of signing an agreement with blockchain software company ConsenSys.  Reports first surfaced in 2021 that the Premier League was taking a “slow and cautious” approach to partnering with a crypto platform to offer new avenues for fan engagement.  Sky News also reported that a separate deal between the Premier League and NBA Top Shots creator Dapper Labs was being discussed.  Sorare is currently under pressure from both both U.K. and French gambling regulators, with investigations looking into whether Sorare requires a gambling license.  The company said in October it is “very confident"" it does not offer any forms of gambling, although it bowed to pressure one month later by stating that it would expand free access to its games.  The French National Gambling Authority (ANJ) threatened that if changes aren't implemented by March it can impose fines of up 5% of Sorare's annual turnover.  While Sorare doesn't offer traditional gambling products like sports betting, the speculative nature of trading NFTs that are valued based on real-world events walks a fine line between what does and doesn't constitute gambling.

This adjustment is one of the largest positive adjustments so far for the year, and with the new ATH comes a brand new set of implications for the digital asset. Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Reaches New High On Sunday, January 29, the bitcoin mining difficulty underwent a 4.68% adjustment that saw the difficulty shoot up. It took place at block 774,308 and the difficulty is now currently sitting at 39.35 terahash per second on a seven-day basis. Related Reading: Here’s What Might Have Triggered Ethereum’s Decline Below $1,600 This adjustment puts the difficulty above its previous high of 37.59 TH/s which was recorded on January 16th. The next difficulty adjustment is expected to take place on February 11. Forecasts for the next adjustment are set at an upward 3.63% which would put the difficulty at a new all-time high. BTC difficulty adjusts to 39.35T | Source: CoinWarz Over the last 30 days alone, the bitcoin mining difficulty is already up more than 11.27% as 2023 starts off on a high note. It also shows that more miners are plugging back into the network, hence the high adjustments being recorded. Nevertheless, the competition is good for the digital asset as not only do more miners on the network help to secure it, but more rigs coming online means a high level of demand for the digital asset. BTC is now much harder to mine so miners will have to increase their hashrate to be able to efficiently mine the same volume as they used to. Will This Affect The BTC Price? Over the last day, the bitcoin price has already seen a drawdown following the difficulty adjustment. This comes as no surprise as there was ample resistance at the $24,000 level and the adjustment only helped to put more selling pressure on the coin. However, the digital asset continues to hold above the $23,000 price level which is great because this ensures that BTC remains above its 100-day and 200-day moving averages. As long as both of these levels hold, the price of BTC still remains firmly in a bullish trend. Related Reading: U.S. Institutions Are Driving Bitcoin Prices, Matrixport Research As long as the price of BTC is also on the high side, miners will not be putting as much selling pressure on the market. They will have to sell fewer tokens in order to keep their operations going, as well as be able to hold a higher percentage of their mined coins. In the end, there is not much supporting evidence that the mini-bull rally is over but that remains to be seen.

The regulator published its plans for implementing rules and regulations set out in the Financial Products and Services Consumer Protection Act approved by former President Rodrigo R. Duterte in May. While the act does not name individual financial services or products, the SEC's draft of rules for implementation, published Jan. 20, includes crypto in its classification of securities.  ""Securities shall include 'tokenized securities products' or those which grew with the abstraction of key characteristics from cryptocurrency’s underlying distributed ledger technology to apply in the traditional financial sector,"" the draft said.  Crypto adoption in the Philippines skyrocketed in 2022 on the tail end of the bull market that closed with multiple high-profile bankruptcies, and regulators in the country have been moving to clamp down on the industry.  ""It is the policy of the State to ensure that appropriate mechanisms are in place to protect the interest of consumers of financial products and services under the conditions of transparency, fair and sound market conduct, and fair, reasonable, and effective handling of financial consumer disputes, which are aligned with global best practices,"" the draft says.  The country's Market Securities and Registration Department (MSRD) will be tasked with supervising entities offering securities or related services.

FTX filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 11 in Delaware, and its new owners are attempting to unwind the affairs of as many as 134 entities across the world.  Within days of the bankruptcy filing, Turkish law enforcement announced a probe into FTX's activities, and on Nov. 23, authorities ordered the seizure of virtually all FTX's assets in Turkey, making it fruitless to include them in wider restructuring plans, the new U.S. management said.  “The orders entered by this court do not have legal or practical effect in Turkey, and the debtors have no reason to believe that the Turkish government will comply with this court’s orders,” FTX said in the filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware. “As a result, the debtors are unable to exercise sufficient control over the affairs of the Turkish debtors in order to comply with their duties under the bankruptcy code.”  The request concerns FTX Turkey, a local exchange 80% owned by parent company FTX Trading Ltd. and SNG Investments, a wholly owned subsidiary of FTX’s affiliated trading arm, Alameda Research. Both are described in the filing as “not strategic” within the corporate group, with assets and activities largely confined to Turkey.  The parent company can still take action under Turkish law, and some Turkish creditors have already started filing private claims in local courts, the filing said. CoinDesk has previously reported that staff often put their paychecks into the company because of their distrust of local banks and depreciation of the lira.  A hearing on the issue is schedule for March 8. Non-U.S. creditors of the exchange, fearing they may be overlooked by U.S. proceedings, have sought to ensure their representation in the case by forming a committee that can intervene on their behalf.

42413007,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7LLQ,1675077043,"Deflationary Ether Is Underperforming Bitcoin, Here Are 3 Reasons Why","Ether (ETH) turned deflationary two weeks ago, with its net supply increase turning negative for the first time in over a month.  The second-largest cryptocurrency's net issuance or the annualized inflation rate dropped below zero on Jan. 15 and stood at -0.01% at press time, according to ultrasound.money. The data shows the leading smart-contract blockchain is now burning more ether than what's being minted as opposed to bitcoin.  Still, the native token of Ethereum's blockchain lags behind bitcoin (BTC) as January draws to a close.  While bitcoin has gained nearly 43% this month, ether has appreciated by 36%, CoinDesk data shows. The ether-bitcoin ratio, or ETH/BTC, is on track to post its second straight monthly decline.  Here are three factors responsible for ether's underperformance:  Defensive positioning before Shanghai upgrade  ""The most important [reason] is defensive positioning ahead of the Shanghai update. In a few months, this will enable withdrawals of ETH from the Beacon Chain. Some fear a share of these unlocked ETHs will get sold,"" Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at financial firm Marex Solutions, said in an email.  Ethereum's Shanghai upgrade, expected in March, will allow the withdrawals of 17.2 million ether staked or deposited in Beacon Chain since December 2020.  The whole staking balance of 17.26 million cannot be withdrawn on the day of the upgrade, and only 43,200 ETH can be unstaked per day. However, the total staking reward of the past two years, which equates to around 1 million ETH, can be withdrawn instantly.  The market is worried that the unlocked ether will be instantly liquidated into the market, pushing the price of the cryptocurrency lower.  ""The 1 million instantly withdrawable ether is more of a concern. This amounts to around 1% of free-floating ether, in other words, not staked ether. In a matter of minutes, the whole stack gets withdrawable, potentially causing holders to rush to exchanges to liquidate the ether as soon as the floodgates are open, pushing down the price,"" Saxo Bank said in a blog post.  ""This sentiment about upcoming selling pressure is likely to be more powerful as the Shanghai hard fork comes closer,"" Saxo Bank noted, adding some traders may hedge against an expected price drop by shorting the cryptocurrency in the futures market.  Macro-driven bull revival  Favorable macroeconomic developments have partly fueled the recent crypto market rebound, helping bitcoin, a macro asset, outshine ether.  Recent U.S. government reports and business surveys have shown a decline in manufacturing activity and inflation expectations, bolstering hopes for an early end to Federal Reserve's liquidity tightening that roiled risky assets last year. As of Friday, traders saw a 55% probability that the central bank would pause rate hikes in May, according to the CME's Fed Watch tool.  ""I think it's [BTC's bigger gains] because this move is based on changing macro regime towards the end of Fed hike cycle, so it's a pure monetary policy play (hence gold also performing) – that in itself to me is reflective that this move is being driven by institutions, not retail,"" David Brickell, director of institutional sales at crypto liquidity network Paradigm, told CoinDesk.  Singapore-based crypto options trading firm QCP Capital made a similar observation, saying, ""All of the BTC gains this year have come during U.S. (trading) hours, with a sharp increase in open interest in CME futures.""  Several institutions and companies like software vendor MicroStrategy have been looking at bitcoin as a hedge against fiscal and monetary policy imprudence since the crash of 2020. Ether, meanwhile, remains a bet on a wider alternative cryptocurrency ecosystem.  According to Adam Farthing, chief risk officer for Japan at crypto trading firm B2C2, bitcoin's relatively bigger gains stem from a short squeeze – a rally driven by the mass closure of bearish bets.  ""In Q4 2022, the market held short BTC against perceived credit risk issues, which is now being unwound. The market did not hold this short in ETH, so there is no unwind,"" Farthing said.  Short interest in bitcoin rose after Sam Bankman Fried's crypto exchange FTX went bust in early November, raising the risk of a market-wide contagion. The CME futures traded at a record discount in mid-November, reflecting extreme bearish sentiment.  Bitcoin a gateway to crypto  The previous crypto market upswings began with bitcoin leading the way higher and alternative cryptocurrencies, including ether, outperforming the market leader in the later stages of the bull run.  History seems to be repeating itself, with bitcoin and stablecoins still being preferred as a gateway to the crypto market.  ""For most macro investors, BTC is the obvious on-ramp into the crypto market – the most liquid, the widest range of on-ramps. We see this in the strong increase in BTC spot volumes (while ETH spot volumes have not risen much), surge in the open interest on CME and stronger positioning in the options market,"" Noelle Acheson, author of the popular ""Crypto Is Macro Now"" newsletter, said.  Lastly, rotation of money into more risky corners of the crypto market like gaming and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) seems to have played a role in slowing ether's ascent relative to bitcoin.  ""One of our theories as of the moment is that speculative demand has rotated from ETH (blue chip) to riskier and newer coins such as APT and SOL.

The article had said FTX would allow traders to buy crypto assets with margin loans up to 20 times their investment.  The Guardian had earlier reported on ASIC's enquiries.  FTX Australia called in administrators, the process of handing over control to licensed insolvency practitioners, hours before FTX filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States on Nov. 11, 2022. Australia's government made moves to tighten safety around crypto shortly after. The exchange owes around 30,000 customers cryptocurrency or money.  In December 2022, Australia's Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones pushed back against ASIC's suggestion that it lacked the power to intervene on the financial services licence of FTX. ASIC already had “extensive powers” to suspend, cancel or vary an Australian Financial Services Licence, Jones said.  ""Since March 2022, ASIC had made enquiries with FTX Australia about the financial products offered by FTX Australia. The issues raised included pricing, FTX Australia’s compliance with ASIC’s CFD product intervention order and its on-boarding of clients,"" an ASIC spokesperson said.

42413030,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7LYW,1675063024,Floki Inu DAO Passes Proposal to Burn Over $100M Worth of Tokens,"The Floki Inu community voted in favor of a recent governance proposal that sought to burn 4.2 trillion FLOKI tokens on a cross-chain bridge and reduce transactional tax.  The proposal passed with a 99.97% majority voting in favor of burning the bridge tokens while 0.03% voted against the proposal, developers said. The FLOKI transaction tax will be lowered to 0.3% effective 8 p.m. UTC on Feb. 3, while the 4.2 trillion tokens will be permanently burnt at 8 p.m. UTC on Feb. 9, 2023.  The scheduled token burn is worth over $100 million as of Monday, CoinGecko data shows.  Burning tokens is a way of reducing supply, which subsequently adds value to each token as long as the level of demand remains the same.  As such, the Floki Inu proposal pointed out security risks associated with bridges as another rationale. Last year alone saw over $2 billion lost or stolen from cross-chain bridges, as CoinDesk previously reported.  “More exploits and data have emerged to show how much of a threat cross-chain bridges could pose, especially if they hold a significant amount of a token’s supply,” the proposal stated.  “In Floki’s case, an exploit on our main cross-chain bridge would have a catastrophic impact on the project since this bridge currently holds 55.7% of what FLOKI’s total circulating supply should be. This is a lot of tokens, and that’s more than enough to drain the project’s liquidity pools and essentially destroy the project if exploited,” developers added in the now-assed proposal.  Developers behind Floki Inu, a Shiba Inu dog breed-themed project, previously told CoinDesk the move was part of a broader plan towards positioning Floki Inu as a serious decentralized finance (DeFi) project. The team has launched ongoing projects such as Floki Locker and the metaverse game Valhalla in the past few months.  The Floki bridge  Floki initially issued its token on Ethereum with a total supply of 10 trillion tokens, before eventually expanding to the faster and cheaper BNB Chain in 2021 based on community requests.  The team had to launch another contract on the BNB Chain with its own total supply of 10 trillion tokens. However, this required a cross-chain bridge to ensure that the FLOKI's total circulating supply at any given time never exceed a total supply of 10 trillion tokens and to allow for users to transfer their FLOKI from Ethereum to BNB Chain and vice versa.  At the time, the team used 600 billion tokens from its treasury on Ethereum and BNB Chain to provide the initial funds for the bridge.  Since then, most holders locked their FLOKI tokens on Ethereum and transferred those out on BNB Chain. “As a result of this, while the majority of the supply is still on the ETH chain there is now such a balance that the absence of a bridge would not threaten the stability of project,” developers wrote in the proposal.",POSITIVE,ETH | BNB | FLOKI,ETH | REGULATION | SHIB | BNB | FLOKI,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/30/floki-inu-dao-passes-proposal-to-burn-over-100m-worth-of-tokens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5149ee3f3ce091cfcd6fc5ef2602bd890c801554-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Bitcoin Continues Flying High ... for Now  By James Rubin  On the weekend before the U.S. central bank unveils its latest interest rate decision, crypto investors were in a buoyant mood.  They sent bitcoin as close to $24,000 as it's been since mid-August. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization topped $23,900 at one point Sunday before retreating to about $23,760, a nearly 3% gain over the past 24 hours. Markets have remained largely hopeful the past week despite sometimes conflicting economic data and worrisome fourth quarter earnings reports from some of the world's biggest brands.  On Friday, news from the inflation front tilted favorably with the U.S. Commerce Department's announcing that personal consumption expenditures (PCE) excluding food and energy in December had registered its most moderate annual rate increase since October 2021. The PCE, a key inflationary measure that the Federal Reserve weighs heavily in its monetary decisions, offered the latest evidence of a cooling economy, although it also showed services inflation remaining stubbornly resilient.  ""The decline in goods inflation is welcome, as it brings inflation closer to the [Federal Reserve's] 2% goal (for reducing inflation), but with services inflation still sticky, it highlights that the Fed has more work to do,"" First Republic Bank wrote in a weekly note to investors.  Still, Joe DiPasquale, CEO of fund manager BitBull Capital, noted in a text to CoinDesk, that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) was likely to follow through on a widely expected 25 basis point rate hike at its two-day meeting, which begins Tuesday. Investors' hopes for this more dovish tilt in monetary policy after eight months of harsher increases have fueled much of January's surge in crypto prices and other risk assets.  The ""more modest increase is part of the reason that many crypto prices have increased,"" DiPasquale wrote. ""It’s seen as a positive economic sign and is now being baked into the demand for bitcoin. It has been positively correlated with the equities markets in recent years and the lower rate is a bullish sign for the stock market.""  Ether, the second-largest crypto in market value, fared even better than BTC on Sunday, rising nearly 5% at one point to trade over $1,650 at one point. ETH has risen over this threshold twice in the last nine days. Most other major cryptos by market cap spent much of Sunday firmly in the green with MANA, the token of 3D virtual reality platform Decentraland, and SAND, the native currency of the metaverse game Sandbox, recently jumping more than 15% and 7%, respectively, and SOL, the token of the Solana blockchain, up 8.2%.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, recently spiked more than 3.3%.  Equity markets furthered their upbeat January on Friday with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500, which has a hefty technology component, each closing up the better part of a percentage point. The S&P has reached its highest level in nearly two months, a reversal from its desultory 2022. Investors are cautiously optimistic about inflation and other macroeconomic uncertainties, even as such powerhouses as Amazon, Salesforce and Microsoft have announced job cuts in anticipation of an economic contraction.  In crypto news, the sad saga of Sam Bankman-Fried continued on Friday with federal prosecutors asking U.S. District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan to ban the former CEO of FTX from communicating privately with current and former employees of the embattled exchange and its investment arm, Alameda Research. Prosecutors said Bankman-Fried had reached out to one former FTX employee in what they described as a thinly veiled attempt to “influence potential testimony.""  BitBull's DiPasquale said that current market conditions remain ripe for a turn lower after the weeks-long surge fueled by a short squeeze and investor optimism. ""Investors might choose to take profits now given the downside potential after several weeks of gains, and the possibility that bitcoin may test $20k again in the near future,"" DiPasquale wrote.

Insights  Amazon Moves Into Web3. But Is the World Ready for Amazon Web3?  By Sam Reynolds  Amazon is rumored to be unveiling a Web3 initiative, according to a report by Blockworks. What this project will look like when it materializes is unclear: It might involve gaming, a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace or something in between.  Either the regulatory complexity and uncertainty of doing this will kill the project before it begins, or Amazon has the size and scale to ""make the market"" on this and bring the Web3 economy into the mainstream.  Flying blind?  Generally speaking, major blue-chip corporations have avoided Web3 because of legal uncertainties. Sure, there have been efforts by payment companies like Visa and Mastercard to integrate stablecoins into their networks, many crypto nodes are hosted on Amazon’s cloud service AWS and Big Tech and traditional finance (TradFi) firms are regular investors in the crypto economy.  But this doesn’t mean they are stakeholders in the Web3 economy, embracing the ethos of decentralized ownership. Regulatory uncertainty and a lack of clarity interferes. Amazon’s efforts are potentially transformational if it can succeed, which will mean addressing the regulatory issues.  Are NFTs securities?  One of the major issues that would deter Amazon from launching NFT endeavors is whether NFTs are securities.  That issue is currently before the courts in the case Friel v. Dapper Labs and has been debated by many great legal minds.  The consensus is, ""Maybe, maybe not.""  In Friel v. Dapper Labs, the plaintiff, Jeeun Friel, argues that Dapper Labs’ NBA: Top Shot NFTs are securities because their value increases with the success of the project. Dapper Labs also controls the blockchain they are issued on, and takes a cut of every transaction.  The exchanges between Friel and Dapper also involve theories of vertical and horizontal commonality. Horizontal commonality analyzes if the value of each item, in this case, Moments, is independent or dependent on each other (investment contracts issued by the same company would move up and down in sync). Vertical commonality is the link between the value of the Moments and the success of Dapper.  “The proceeds of investors’ purchases in Moments are pooled together in the hands of Dapper Labs, which uses the money to stir up interest in the Marketplace for Moments and build out its Flow blockchain, further driving interest, traffic and money to the NBA Top Shot platform,” the Plaintiffs argue, saying this represents horizontal commonality.  Regarding vertical commonality, Dapper says in the court docket, “There is no vertical commonality because there is no link between the fortunes of each Moments collector and Dapper,” while the plaintiffs contend that the success of Dapper as a company relies on continued sales of these Moments in the secondary market and thus create vertical commonality.  As a recent article in the UNC School of Law’s North Carolina Banking Institute Journal highlights, citing another instance of basketball clubs selling NFTs, the presence of a royalty would encourage the continued promotion and might satisfy the “vertical commonality test because the NFT owner’s fortune would be impacted by the GSW’s effort.”  But that doesn’t mean all NFT transactions would represent securities. In an article published on JD Supra, lawyers Gargi Chaudhuri and James Masella III argue that most buyers – even if expecting to resell the NFT for profit at a later date – are expecting the transaction to be complete at the time of purchase and are not expecting the NFT to evolve or improve over time.  “Although the buyer may be interested in the value of the asset they own and hope to resell it at a later date for a profit, they did not invest in an ongoing, “common enterprise” that would pay the individual some share of profits, they write, cautioning that this is dependent on there not being an active secondary market for the NFTs.  At the same time, OpenSea, one of the largest NFT marketplaces, has been cautioning its staff to avoid using language reminiscent of securities, Fortune reported last year. Speaking with TechCrunch, a former Securities and Exchange Commission lawyer has said that these marketplaces could attract attention with a case involving the sale of unregistered securities, but nothing has happened yet.  Uncertainty is often a killer.  What about copyright?  Copyright and NFTs are a tough one.  On one hand, unless explicitly stated, you don’t control the copyright when you buy a work of art.  But it doesn’t seem like the market understands that. See: Spice DAO’s attempt to purchase the ""Dune Bible"" and create a new adaption for the screen based on the book.  “From a legal perspective, when a buyer purchases an NFT attached to a copyrightable work, at most they may be purchasing a license to display the copyrighted work in a limited capacity,” IP attorneys Ryan W. McBridge and Silas K. Alexander wrote in a 2021 paper. “The copyright holder typically retains the rights of reproduction, adaptation, publication, and performance of the work. A person who buys an NFT cannot legally edit the digital asset and redistribute the work, even though they paid for it.”  There are some exceptions to this. Yuga Labs has released full commercial rights to NFT holders for their entire collection, including Bored Apes. But this is only a license, and Yuga Labs still ""owns"" the IP for the Ape.  In an August 2022 report, Galaxy Digital accused the NFT industry of ""misleading"" the public with its language around NFTs and ownership of copyright.  “The arrangements between NFT issuers and token holders resemble a distinctly Web2 maze of opaque, misleading, complex, and restrictive licensing agreements,” the report said, with Alex Thorn, head of Galaxy Digital Research, telling Decrypt, there’s “a discrepancy between what the public thinks they're buying and what they're really buying”.  A recent judgment in a court case between Yuga Labs and two artists it accused of making knockoffs of its NFTs (which are generated by an artificial intelligence algorithm) and infringing on its copyright further complicated the issue with the court refusing to weigh in on the topic of NFTs and copyright.  “[The] defendants again want an advisory opinion from the Court about copyright and NFTs. But the standing requirement of Article III prevents exactly this use of federal courts to adjudicate hypothetical questions, just as it does in the defamation context, the ruling reads.""  Given this minefield, is this really a market that Amazon wants to double down on?  Crypto gaming and gambling  Blockworks’ report mentions that Amazon’s NFT effort might involve some sort of Web3 gaming engagement. A tantalizing possibility, considering that GameFi has a $10 billion market cap according to CoinGecko data.  But Play to Earn – one of the more popular genres of Web3 gaming – has all sorts of legal pitfalls.  In many markets in Asia, there are already specific laws, some first written 20 years ago, on the books involving trading gaming tokens for cash, as CoinDesk has previously reported.  A 2004 game called Seatalk, which had a (physical) token component made the Korean government write specific laws prohibiting converting gaming tokens to cash. China banned it in 2007 after Tencent developed a virtual currency called QQ Coins, used in its online universe and exchangeable for Yuan.  In Canada, lawyers at a firm called Osler highlighted in an October 2022 paper that the entire play-to-earn model might run afoul of the country’s gambling rules.  “Generally, the Criminal Code prohibits games that are fundamentally premised on: the payment of money (or money’s worth) by the user; and the possibility that the user can earn money (or money’s worth) from playing,” they write.  Lawyers at Washington, D.C.-based law firm Ifrah have also said that Play-to-Earn risks violating state and federal gambling law because of the need to pay something of value (the NFT) to participate.  Can Amazon pull this off?  All this isn’t to say that Amazon faces an impossible task.  The company has access to almost infinite legal resources and compliance teams to create a version of Web3 that doesn’t run afoul of the law – despite there being limited legal guidance available and existing paradigms being regulatory and compliance hellscapes.  Some might argue, citing a declining market for NFTs and the overall bear sentiment for crypto, that this is the time to do it. But entering at the bottom of the market can also create market momentum, and there’s nobody like Amazon with its scale in the Web2 world.  Amazon entering this market would certainly legitimize it in the eyes of many, and it would be an important step in creating an institutional-grade asset out of NFTs. But first, they need to push through the regulatory challenges.
