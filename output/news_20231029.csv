19563566,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=558109,1698598846,Analyst Predicts Terra LUNA To Surge By 80-100% Following Key Event,"LUNA, the native token of the Terra 2.0 blockchain, was among the many gainers in the past week positively affected by Bitcoin’s impressive rally toward the $35,000 mark. According to data from CoinMarketCap, LUNA is up by 13.96% in the last seven days, providing some relief for investors who have had to endure the token’s bearish form in the previous weeks leading to this price rise. As expected, LUNA’s current bullish form has now attracted much attention, with some analysts speculating there could be more gains in the coming weeks. Related Reading: Terra Validator Opposes USTC Burning, Pushes Alternative Plan To Regain Dollar Peg LUNA Could Double Its Value After Breaching Major Trendline, Analyst Says In a post on X on Sunday, crypto analyst Captain Faibik shared with his 67,000 followers an intriguing bullish prediction on LUNA’s price trajectory. Faibik, who claimed to not be a LUNA enthusiast, noted that the altcoin has recently broken a major bearish trendline and could potentially gain by 80-100%. According to Faibik’s analysis, LUNA traded above $0.47 in the past week, breaching a bearish trendline that stretches as far back as January 2023 on the token’s daily chart. Traditionally, trendlines are used by traders to connect several price points together and provide some insight into the potential direction of an asset’s price movement. When an asset’s price moves out of an established trendline, as in the case of LUNA, it can be interpreted as an impending price reversal. Since the start of 2023, LUNA has produced an overall negative price performance, losing over 63% of its value in the last 10 months. However, if Faibik’s prediction proves true, the popular altcoin could be on its way to a remarkable recovery. At the time of writing, LUNA trades at $0.468 with a 0.70% decline in the last day. With an 80-100% price increase, this price could rise as high as $0.934 in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, LUNA’s daily trading volume is currently down by 3.73% and valued at $48.67 million. With a market cap of $263.92 million, LUNA is ranked as the 117th largest cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Is Terra Classic Planning For USTC To Be Pegged To The Dollar Again?

Trading volumes for the world’s largest cryptocurrency hit their highest levels since March, showing that interest in Bitcoin is booming once more. The entire crypto market saw an inflow of funds during the week, leading to a surge in market cap. Data from CoinGecko shows that the entire market cap increased from $1.184 trillion on Sunday, October 22, to $1.312 trillion on Wednesday, October 25. Most of this inflow went into Bitcoin, which saw its share of the cryptocurrency market increase from 49.58% to 51.47 % during this same time period. Related Reading: Injective (INJ) Rules Weekend Top 50 Crypto Ranking With 60% Hike – Here’s Why Chart From CoinGecko Daily Crypto Exchange Volumes Reach 8-Month High The recent boom in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency prices pushed Bitcoin daily trading volumes on crypto exchanges to their highest level since March. According to The Block’s data dashboard, the seven-day moving average for spot exchange volumes across multiple exchanges hit $24.12 billion on Thursday and $23.98 billion on Friday, respectively. In comparison, Bitcoin trading volume on exchanges was at $11.02 billion on the first day of the month. Chart from The Block A similar metric from IntoTheBlock shows Bitcoin transactions reaching 1.4 million BTC as bulls looked to push Bitcoin to $35,000. Chart from IntoTheBlock Trading volumes are an important metric because higher volumes suggest greater interest and activity in a market. It means more people are actively buying and selling, leading to more liquidity and volatility. Whale activity also increased during this time period, as indicated by on-chain trackers.
