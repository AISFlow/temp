The first cryptocurrency by market cap is making its way up from its yearly low, $29,900, after a season trending to the downside. At the time of writing, BTC trades at $52,333 with a 1.4% and 7% profit in the daily and weekly charts, respectively. Bitcoin smashed the major resistance at $52,000, as news about El Salvador buying its first BTC came out of that country&apos;s presidential office. The bulls are back in control, it would seem, and Bitcoin could potentially rise to its next resistance level at around $56,000, for the first time since May. If it does break that resistance, the bulls could attempt a move into the $60,000 area. This could put BTC&apos;s price in the &apos;path of least resistance&apos;, as Senior Commodity Strategist for Bloomberg Intelligence Mike McGlone said. The price target for that path is $100,000 by the end of 2021 for the first cryptocurrency by market cap, and $5,000 for the second, Ethereum. McGlone noted: After enduring a gut-wrenching correction, we see the crypto market more likely to resume its upward trajectory than drop below the 2Q lows.

An executive at the asset management firm told Bloomberg News the company will consider adding bitcoin to a number of investment funds available to its private investors, with a maximum bitcoin exposure of 2% of total assets for each fund. No fixed timeline was given for when the new investment strategy will be implemented but it could be as soon as the fourth quarter of this year.  The Frankfurt-based asset manager is the investment arm of DZ Bank Group and, according to its website, it had about €386 billion asset under management (US$457.6 billion) as of Dec. 30, 2020. The company suffered €243 million in losses when Wirecard filed for bankruptcy in June 2020, Financial Times reported on Aug. 15.  Union Investment’s announcement is the latest example of how crypto investment has become easier in Germany.

OP Crypto Capital Management Ltd., formed two months ago and announced Monday by the former senior investment director of Huobi Capital, David Gan, aims to bridge centralized and decentralized finance with the metaverse.  Gan was also recently the former managing director of Huobi Labs, the exchange’s blockchain incubator that began in 2017.  The firm is backed by Huobi Ventures, Galaxy Digital’s Vision Hill, Bybit investment arm Mirana Ventures, The Brooker Group and Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk.  OP Crypto says it plans to achieve its lofty goal by investing in projects it believes will help shape the future of corporate governance and transfer power from centralized entities to content creators in the upcoming Web 3.0 ecosystem.  Gan told CoinDesk in an interview the firm’s fund had targeted a soft cap of around $25 million but was oversubscribed by an as yet undetermined amount that “should end up well above the initial soft cap mark.”  OP Crypto Capital aims to help founders build projects during their earliest stages. Gan, who is the fund’s founder, said he would work with, incubate and assist projects during their earliest pre-seed rounds.  “OP crypto looks to ... fill the void left by some of biggest funds that are no longer interested in investing at the earliest stage,” Gan said.  Assistance by the firm and its fund includes helping a budding project with its product-market fit, token economics and talent acquisition, among others with a focus on “bridging the gap” between the “Eastern and Western markets.”  “There currently lacks a crypto venture capital firm here in the U.S. that has very in-depth ties to the Asia markets, being that I am the only solo Chinese general partner coming out of a major tier 1 exchange,” said Gan. “The fund’s current team members bring experience and deep relationships at several exchanges, including Huobi, Binance, OKEx in addition to Republic and CoinList.”  Read more: EU-Backed Investment Fund Puts $30M Into Crypto VC Firm’s New $130M Vehicle",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | BNB,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/06/former-huobi-exec-launches-25m-fund-seeking-to-bridge-cefi-defi-and-the-metaverse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a9f4706456a50c7ae71bdf16d5feb62e3d8f7720-1440x956.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A ten-dollar bill can be exchanged for the same bill or for two five-dollar bills. Therefore, non-fungible means something that cannot be fractioned or exchanged - precisely because it is a unique token. In other words, NFTs are unique digital assets that contain data ownership information recorded on a blockchain, often used to scan and tokenize digital items such as art, collectibles, or game items. In general, NFTs are held on the Ethereum blockchain, but other blockchains, such as Flow, also support this type of token. Briefly, blockchain technology is a system that allows you to track the sending and receiving of some types of information over the Internet. It works like a digital ledger that carries connected information - like blocks of data that form a chain - hence the name. How does NFT work?

At a Sept. 2 meeting, the Thai SEC ordered the crypto exchange to continue a suspension of its services in the country. The SEC gave the exchange three months to return or buy back customers’ assets.  Huobi Thailand has failed to fix system flaws identified more than five months ago, despite several deadline extensions, the SEC said.  The flaws were found in trading, customer asset retention and information technology systems, among others, during a review between February and March of this year, according to the regulator.  “Huobi Thailand offers digital asset trading services with local legal and compliance standards,” Huobi Global said in a WeChat message. “Due to product changes and to better serve local users with enhanced application and trading services, Huobi Thailand has temporarily decided to suspend trading service.”  The Thai SEC first notified the company of the issues in March. In a follow-up meeting on April 1, the regulator asked it to suspend its services until it resolved the issues but the exchange asked for an extension, according to the SEC statement. The commission granted an extension until Aug. 31.  In June, Huobi Thailand suspended its services and asked users to withdraw their assets as it was preparing to move its operations under a new name, DS Exchange, the Bangkok Post reported. Saturday’s SEC notice said Huobi (Thailand) Co. is now called DSDAQ (Thailand) Co.  At the September meeting, the regulator found that Huobi Thailand had failed to fix the problems. It denied the exchange’s request for another extension.  Huobi was the fifth exchange to obtain a digital asset trading license in Thailand. That was granted in July 2019.  The Thai SEC released new rules for crypto custodians in late August.  “Huobi Thailand is based on the original Huobi Cloud Thailand project built by Huobi Cloud and its local Thai partner, GLT,” Huobi Global said. “Huobi Cloud provides only technical product support and brand authorization. The current brand authorization and technical service contracts with Huobi Thailand have expired, and Huobi Cloud will no longer provide support for this project in the future.”  Regulators from Singapore to Spain have been increasing oversight of crypto exchanges.

This reflects the rapid development of the sector and the inflow of new capital into digital assets. Nevertheless, the crypto industry market cap remains several times smaller than the capitalization of the gold market ($10.6 trillion) or the market for public shares ($100 trillion). Even more, capital is locked in productive assets in the accounts of companies and corporations, in the form of securities, bills of exchange, futures and options, which have been inactive for years, bringing modest dividends to their owners. If even a small portion of this capital moves to the decentralized finance sector, the cryptocurrency market capitalization will increase by billions of dollars. Zam.io&apos;s solutions are designed to unite centralized and decentralized finance by duplicating equity capital on the blockchain. How it works is discussed below. Stock-backed stablecoins?

42376204,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwHZXV,1630924117,Bitcoin Tops Resistance at $51K as Golden Cross Nears,"Bitcoin looks set to continue to rise after clearing a key resistance level, with charts hinting at a so-called golden crossover, a long-term bullish indicator.  On Sunday, the biggest cryptocurrency printed a UTC close well above $51,109, marking an upside break of the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the April-to-June sell-off.  The breakout could bring additional demand because chart traders often use Fibonacci ratios such as 61.8%, 38.2%, and 23.6% to identify support, resistance and trading opportunities.  Last week also saw bitcoin break above other crucial hurdles at $48,644 and $49,105, Stack Funds’ Head of Research Lennard Neo said, adding that the move looks sustainable. “The fact that BTC is trading above the 200-day MA gives further confidence that these critical levels are resistances turned support,” Neo said, referring to the moving average.  “More interestingly, we have observed five out of six days of continuous bid momentum that outshine the offers. This further support the upside thesis for the digital asset, at least in the near term,” he said.  Bitcoin consolidated above the 200-day MA in the past two weeks, building a base for Sunday’s move above $50,000.  While the 200-day MA is steady near $46,100 at press time, the 50-day MA is trending north and looks set to cross above the former in the next few days. That would confirm a golden crossover, which occurs when the short-term average moves above the long-term measure.  Trend-following traders consider the golden cross as a buy signal and may hit the market with fresh bids. The previous instance of the golden cross, in May 2020, was followed by an 11-month climb that saw prices rise from $9,000 to over $60,000. It’s not, however, a perfect indicator, having trapped traders on the wrong side of the market in February 2020 and July 2014.  Still, the latest golden cross is backed by bullish on-chain data showing renewed accumulation by large investors and a declining bitcoin balance on exchanges. Bitcoin is currently trading largely unchanged on the day near $51,800.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/06/bitcoin-tops-resistance-at-51k-as-golden-cross-nears,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8024be3b0c027d8b314fc41571c42f62a854ddbf-1500x1158.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Whether it&apos;s Decentraland with their total of 90,601 10m x 10m land plots or Earth2 and Next Earth with well over a trillion plots, these form the basic foundations of all these projects. Many are built on the initial sales of these lands, acting as a primary stage for jump-starting the whole metaverse itself. With an economy that follows and incorporates a record of land ownership, that can be minted as NFTs on the blockchain.

A draft of the speech was published on the FCA website.  In the talk, he discussed the threat that token issuers may pose to vulnerable people by promoting speculative investments.  He also suggested, however, that greater regulatory oversight might be harmful, creating a “halo effect,” whereby unrealistic expectations are raised around consumer protection.  “One thing is clear: because of the decentralized way that these speculative tokens are created, any effective system of regulation would require a business seeking registration or authorization with the FCA to bring itself firmly within our reach, with people and resources that we could access in order to supervise and enforce our requirements,” Randell said, according to the draft.  FCA registration would not be granted to companies that are unable to explain basic issues related to business structure and governance. Those concerns were recently aired regarding the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance. In a supervisory notice dated June 25, the FCA concluded that Binance was “not capable of being effectively supervised.”  One of the FCA’s main areas of concern for the crypto market should be that of promotions, according to Randell.  “It’s absolutely imperative that any regulation of cryptoasset promotions requires the risks to be clearly highlighted and does not give the impression that the token itself is subject to regulatory supervision or has regulatory approval.”  Read more: UK Regulator to Launch £11M Campaign Warning of Crypto Risks",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,Jamie Crawley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/06/token-issuers-need-to-be-brought-firmly-within-our-reach-fca-chair-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b32347f1c33f78fae68abbd723787656584aa34f-1500x934.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a press release Monday, BTCM said it would invite its customers over the coming months to open Volt bank accounts in a bid to provide enhanced security and real-time trading experiences.  Instead of depositing to BTCM trust accounts, the exchange’s customers will be able to utilize the neobank’s accounts, embedded within the exchange’s environment. Security is front of mind for the exchange, which exposed the names and email addresses of over 270,000 users when it sent out mass emails in error.  Deposits in Volt accounts are insured up to A$250,000 per customer under Australia’s Financial Claims Scheme.  The partnership marks a first of its kind in the country, the companies said. It also follows a recent Senate inquiry into accusations that traditional Australian banks were “de-banking” cryptocurrency operators by denying them core banking services.  “I think it’s a shot in the arm for financial innovation in Australia,” Caroline Bowler, CEO of BTCM, told CoinDesk via Telegram. “The whole process took about three years. It was a commitment from both of us to see this through.”  Neobanks, also known as digital banks, began launching in Australia in 2018 after legislative changes to the country’s banking sector. Volt began offering its services in 2019 after obtaining an unrestricted Authorized Deposit-Taking Institution license and claims to be Australia’s first neobank.  “The first is always the hardest to get done,” said Bowler. “This partnership shows it is possible for regulated entities in Australia to partner with the right crypto providers or other fintechs.”  BTCM services more than 325,000 Australian customers and has risen to one of the country’s top marketplaces for crypto trading, per trade volume.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | SPONSORED,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/06/australian-neobank-volt-inks-partnership-deal-with-crypto-exchange-btc-markets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/df922b11340e889e504b5a4561b98550b22d17ca-5184x3456.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Number 12 largest cryptocurrency, Litecoin (LTC), over the past 48 hours has seen a sporadic price surge seeing it record a new three-month high price at $225. The coin crossed the $200 resistance on Saturday to get in the bullish market alongside series of other altcoins. The altcoin had a daily close above 200 Moving average, setting up a highly bullish scenario. According to technical indicators, if it manages a weekly close above it, the altcoin could join the bull party like never before. This surge for Litecoin comes as the altcoin has struggled for a leg up in the past three months. It was less than $13 during that time as the entire crypto market took the hit.

In an announcement on Friday, Zee Studios said it is offering an NFT of a signed poster from its movie “Suraj Pe Mangal Bhari,” comedy-drama about a wedding detective whose background check on a prospective groom results in trouble for all involved. The NFT will be part of the “Zee Studios Collection,” powered by NFTically.  “It is a defining moment for us to become the first film studio in India to launch NFTs, and this initiative ties in with our future plans,” Shariq Patel, chief business officer at Zee Studios, said in the press release shared with CoinDesk. “Zee Studios will provide NFTs for cinema lovers and collectors through its repository of a strong lineup of film content.”  NFTs are unique, verifiable cryptographic tokens representing a wide range of tangible and intangible items like pictures and videos.  Established in 2012, Zee Studios, a subsidiary of Essel Group, is well known for distributing films across genres, budgets and languages in India. With Zee catching the NFT bug, other India-based entertainment giants may soon follow suit.  Recently, Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan launched his own digital collectibles through the NFT platform Beyondlife.club.  The crypto sub-sector has exploded this year on growing interest across the art, sport and media worlds. Data tracked by DappRadar show NFT sales rose to $2.47 billion in the first half of 2021 from a negligible amount a year earlier. OpenSea, the world’s largest NFT platform, saw a record volume of $1.9 billion in August versus $8 million in January, per Reuters.  NFTically is a global business-to-business, software as a service (SaaS) platform that allows celebrities, influencers, gamers, clubs and enterprises to launch their own white-label NFT store without needing to have any technical knowledge.  “We are excited to work closely with the Zee Studios team in launching their first-ever NFTs,” Toshendra Sharma, CEO and founder of NFTically said. “The NFT market, both in India and abroad, is soaring to new heights every day.

Polygon is the first fully functional full-stack scaling solution on top of Ethereum offering fast transactions and extremely low fees. The grant will be used to further develop the integration of Polygon&apos;s scaling solutions into the Polker.Game platform and to ensure that all smart contracts are fully audited and secure on-chain. The Polygon Foundation will also offer support with the implementation of its network in future development. PKR.io + Polker.Game &amp; Polygon Polker.Game&apos;s Play-to-Earn NFT poker platform is powered by its native token $PKR. The platform also uses multiple patented and patent-pending protocols developed and available from PKR.io.

The smart contracts for both protocols were originally designed for the Ethereum network and are written in Solidity code - this is 100% compatible with Polygon. Migration of these smart contracts from the Ethereum mainnet to Polygon&apos;s scaling solution comes with numerous benefits for all parties involved.
