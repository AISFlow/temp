42382628,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sWzN,1568459399,Hodl Hodl Wants You to Clone Its Bitcoin Exchange,"Hodl Hodl plans to make its software freely available so anyone can launch their own version of the peer-to-peer bitcoin exchange.  Announced Saturday at the Baltic Honeybadger conference in Riga, Latvia, the plan is, in part, a recognition that Hodl Hodl's business model is vulnerable to regulatory crackdowns.  “History teaches us that if a government wants to shut you down, it will,” Hodl Hodl CEO Max Keidun told CoinDesk.  Open-sourcing the code for its smart contracts, which Hodl Hodl intends to do sometime next year, is a way to deal with the threat, Keidun said, explaining:  “Let’s imagine, our domain gets blocked — some activist would be able to just take the code from Github, fork it and launch something new.”  Already, people in Africa, Asia and Latin America have reached out to the company, asking about such an opportunity, he said. “Peer-to-peer is something emerging markets, in particular, are interested in.”  Rare breed  Hodl Hodl is a rare animal in the 2019 crypto world: as a matter of principle, it focuses on bitcoin (the only cryptocurrency that the company's founders trust), it doesn't do know-your-customer (KYC) checks and it has no plan to start.  Why not? “Because we don’t like three-letter abbreviations,” Hodl Hodl’s CTO, Roman Snitko, joked in a slide for his presentation to the Riga conference.  In all seriousness, Hodl Hodl is averse to holding the sensitive personal information that financial institutions are mandated to collect from customers under global anti-money-laundering (AML) regulations.  ""We think KYC/AML does more harm by exposing law-abiding users to fraudsters and criminals,"" Snitko told CoinDesk. ""The information and documents users upload to exchanges has been stolen many times in the past. It also does very little to prevent actual money laundering and criminals from using those services. They always find ways.""  Yet regulators across the globe are tightening the screws on the industry to identify the parties to transactions. Most notably, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental body, has directed its member countries to make exchanges collect and store information about who their customers trade with.  Winds of change  Hodl Hodl's founders believe they don’t have to identify customers because the exchange never takes custody of users’ funds.  Rather, it lists offers to buy or sell bitcoin and provides an escrow service in which the seller locks bitcoin in a multi-signature smart contract until the buyer sends fiat. Releasing the bitcoin requires 2 out of 3 signatures, belonging to the buyer, seller, and Hodl Hodl (which steps in as a referee when there's a dispute).  “We don’t touch the crypto, don’t match users automatically and don't keep funds in our wallets,"" Keidun said. ""We create multisigs in a public blockchain,”  In the same June guidance, the FATF said even peer-to-peer platforms may be subject to such regulations in cases ""where the platform facilitates the exchange."" It's unclear whether Hodl Hodl's escrow service counts as ""facilitating.""  But the founders see the way the wind is blowing.  ""We're not switching to the open-source model exclusively because of the regulatory pressure,"" Snitko told CoinDesk. ""In fact, we haven't experienced any due to the fact that we're a non-custodial exchange. However, we do foresee regulators becoming more desperate in their attempts to contain the spread of bitcoin and we refuse to be the victims of desperate actions.""  Passing the reins  At some point, Keidun and Snitko might hand management of Hodl Hodl to others so they can focus entirely on supporting and upgrading the code. (The exchange says it has no head office; employees work remotely, serving 10,000 users worldwide.)  “We want to create a community around us, so that at some point we could pass the reins to other people,” Keidun said. There is no timeframe for that yet.  In his Riga presentation, Snitko also announced Hodl Hodl's intention to open “a bitcoin smart contract app store.”  Another way people can utilize the code is payments for e-commerce, and in the coming months, the team will focus on making the technology plug-and-play, so people who are not proficient coders can easily deploy it in their online store and accept bitcoin.  “We want to launch a platform for bitcoin smart contracts, so that anyone who wants to sell homes online or do [over-the-counter] trades could use it,” Keidun said, adding that it might be a multi-sig with more than three signatures and it can be used for multiple use cases.  Aside from bitcoin-to-fiat trades, Hodl Hodl's multi-sig escrow is used in a peer-to-peer predictions market when people bet on things like the price of bitcoin or publicly traded stock, sports results and other measurable outcomes.

42382637,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sX8B,1568457047,You Can Now Prove a Whole Blockchain With One Math Problem – Really,"The Electric Coin Company (ECC) says it discovered a new way to scale blockchains with “recursive proof composition,"" a proof to verify the entirety of a blockchain in one function. For the ECC and zcash, the new project, Halo, may hold the key to privacy at scale.  A privacy coin based on zero-knowledge proofs, referred to as zk-SNARKs, zcash's current underlying protocol relies on ""trusted setups."" These mathematical parameters were used twice in zcash's short history: upon its launch in 2016 and first large protocol change, Sapling, in 2018.  Zcash masks transations through zk-SNARKs but the creation of initial parameters remains an issue. By not destroying a transaction's mathematical foundation – the trusted setup – the holder can produce forged zcash.  Moreover, the elaborate 'ceremonies' the zcash community undergoes to create the trusted setups are expensive and a weak point for the entire system. The reliance on trusted setups with zk-SNARKs was well known even before zcash's debut in 2016. While other research failed to close the gap, recursive proofs make trusted setups a thing of the past, the ECC claims.  Bowe's Halo  Speaking with CoinDesk, ECC engineer and Halo inventor Sean Bowe said recursive proof composition is the result of years of labor – by him and others – and months of personal frustration. In fact, he almost gave up three separate times.  Bowe began working for the ECC after his interest in zk-SNARKs was noticed by ECC CEO and zcash co-founder Zooko Wilcox in 2015. After helping launch zcash and its first significant protocol change with Sapling, Bowe moved to full-time research with the company.  Before Halo, Bowe worked on a different zk-SNARK variant, Sonic, requiring only one trusted setup.  For most cypherpunks, that's one too many.  ""People we are also starting to think as far back as 2008, we should be able to have proofs that can verify other proofs, what we call recursive proof composition. This happened in 2014,"" Bowe told CoinDesk.  Proofs, proofs and more proofs  In essence, Bowe and Co. discovered a new method of proving the validity of transactions, while masked, by compressing computational data to the bare minimum. As the ECC paper puts it, ""proofs that are capable of verifying other instances of themselves.""  Blockchain transaction such as bitcoin and zcash are based on elliptic curves with points on the curve serving as the basis for the public and private keys. The public address can be thought of the curve: we know what the elliptic curve looks like in general. What we do not know is where the private addresses are which reside on the curve.  It is the function of zk-SNARKs to communicate about private addresses and transactions--if an address exists and where it exists on the curve--anonymously.  [caption id="""" align=""aligncenter"" width=""413""]The secp256k1 elliptic curve, used for bitcoin and ethereum via Hackernoon[/caption]  Bowe’s work is similar to bulletproofs, another zk-SNARK that requires no trusted setup. “What you should think of when you think of Halo is like recursive bulletproofs,” Bowe said.  From a technical standpoint, bulletproofs rely on the “inner product argument,” which relays certain information about the curves to one another. Unfortunately, the argument is both very expensive and time consuming compared to your typical zk-SNARK verification.  By proving multiple zk-SNARKs with one--a task thought impossible until Bowe's research--computational energy is pruned to a fraction of the cost.  “People have been thinking of bulletproofs on top of bulletproofs. The problem the bulletproof verifier is extremely expensive because of the inner product argument,"" Bowe said. ""I don’t use bulletproofs exactly, I use a previous idea bulletproofs are built on.”  In fact, Bowe said recursive proofs mean you can prove the entirety of the bitcoin blockchain in less space than a bitcoin blockhead takes - 80-bytes of data.  The future of zcash  Writing on Twitter, Wilcox said his company is currently studying the Halo implementation as a Layer 1 solution on zcash.  Layer 1 solutions are implementations into the codebase constituting a blockchain. Most scaling solutions, like bitcoin's Lightning Network, are Layer 2 solutions built on top of a blockchain's state. The ECC's interest in turning Halo into a Layer 1 solution speaks to the originality of the discovery as it will reside next to code copied from bitcoin's creator himself, Satoshi Nakamoto.    ECC is exploring the use of Halo for Zcash to both eliminate trusted setup and to scale Zcash at Layer 1 using nested proof composition.        — zooko (@zooko) September 10, 2019      Since the early days of privacy coins, scaling has been a contentious issue: with so much data needed to mask transactions, how do you grow a global network?  Bowe and the ECC claim recursive proofs solve this dilemma: with only one proof needed to verify an entire blockchain, data concerns could be a thing of the past:  “Privacy and scalability are two different concepts, but they come together nicely here. About 5 years ago, academics were working on recursive snarks, a proof that could verify itself or another proof [and even] verify multiple proofs. So, what [recursive proof composition] means is you only need one proof to verify an entire blockchain.”  To be sure, this isn't sophomore-level algebra: Bowe told CoinDesk the proof alone took close to nine months of glueing various pieces together.  A new way to node  A further implication of recursive proofs is the amount of data stored on the blockchain. Since the entire ledger can be verified in one function, onboarding new nodes will be easier than ever, Bowe said.  “You’re going to see blockchains that have much higher capacity because you don’t have to communicate the entire history in one. The state of the chain still needs to be seen. But if you want to download the entire network you don’t need to download the entire blockchain.”  While state chains still need to be monitored for basic transaction verification, syncing the entire history of a blockchain--over 400 GB and 200 GB for ethereum and bitcoin respectively--becomes a redundancy.  For zcash, Halo means easier hard forks. Without trusted setups, ECC research claims, ""proofs of state changes need only reference the latest proof, allowing old history to be discarded forever.""  When asked where his discovery ranks with other advancements, Bowe spoke on its practicality:  ""Where does this stand in the grand scheme of things in cryptocurrency? It’s a cryptographic tool to compress computation… and scale protocols.""

42382641,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sX9R,1568453758,Bitcoin Price Indicator May Signal Next Leg Higher,"History looks to be repeating itself in the bitcoin market, as a key indicator's bullish turn could mark the beginning of the next meteoric price rally.  The world's most valuable cryptocurrency's price action seen over the last eight months is very similar to the moves seen in 2015, according to Bitstamp data. For instance, the bitcoin bear market ended near $3,100 in mid-December 2018 and prices built a base below $4,000 in the following three months before breaking into a bull market on April 2.  Notably, the bear market drop ran out of steam two months before the 50- and 10-week moving averages confirmed a bearish crossover (in February 2019).  Further, the new bull market began two months following the confirmation of the bearish crossover. That is hardly surprising as bearish crossovers of long duration MAs are big-time lagging indicators and often mark bear market bottoms.  What's more interesting is that the previous bear market (2014) had also run out of steam in the run-up to the bearish crossover and the confirmation of the crossover was followed by a bullish breakout, as seen in the chart below.  Weekly chart  The bear market, which began at the end of 2013, ran out of steam at lows near $150 in January 2015. The 50- and 100-week MAs produced a bearish cross in April and a bullish reversal was confirmed at the end of October 2015.  Note that the bull market had stalled around $450 following a quick rise from $320 to $500 in November.  The cryptocurrency resumed the bull market in the last week of May 2016 after prices rose 18 percent and the 50- and 100-week MAs produced a bullish crossover.  More importantly, BTC went on to hit fresh record highs above $1,200 in February 2017.  As of now, BTC is trading around $10,300, having rallied from $4,000 to $13,880 in the second quarter. Essentially, the bull market has stalled in the last few weeks.  With history repeating itself, there is a strong reason to believe that the bullish crossover of the 50- and 100-week MAs, if and when, confirmed, could mark the beginning of a meteoric rise well above $20,000.  Currently, the 50- and 100-week MAs are located at $6,556 and $7,668, respectively.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.
