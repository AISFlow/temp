42426337,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJMbnh,1429909824,Blocked Bitcoin Websites Fight Government Censorship in Russian Court,"Bitcoin websites blacklisted by the Russian government brought their case before a judge today in an attempt to overturn a decision that has restricted domestic access to their domains.  Members of bitcoin news website BTCsec.com and exhibition company Smile Expo were reportedly in attendance at the hearing. The Russian government has filed a petition to dismiss a complaint submitted by the websites, two of six that are currently being blocked by the government.  Smile Expo argued that its website was used for the dissemination of information about its conferences, not cryptocurrency generally, negating the official argument. By comparison, BTCsec took the stance that, despite a standing proposal to ban the release of information on the technology, it is still free to discuss the topic publicly.  Ivan Tikhon, a representative of BTCsec, told Russian-language bitcoin news site Forklog that he believes the actions of the government to be illegal.  ""Cryptocurrency in Russia at the moment is not prohibited, and there is no reason to believe the information about them can't be spread in the territory of the Russian Federation,"" he said.  The hearing, held at the Sverdlovsk Regional Court, follows a decision by the City Court Nevyansk to block access to the domains in January.  A follow-up hearing will be held on 15th May.

42426331,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJMbZh,1429896018,Bitcoin Foundation Director: No Plans to Fund Core Development,"Newly appointed Bitcoin Foundation executive director Bruce Fenton has indicated that the trade organization is unlikely to pursue proposed plans to support bitcoin core development.  The statements come on the heels of Wednesday's announcement that bitcore core developers Gavin Andresen, Wladimir van der Laan and Cory Fields had joined MIT Media Lab's Digital Currency Initiative in a full-time capacity due in part to the financial issues facing the Bitcoin Foundation.  Fenton reported that he was ""not part"" of discussions about the core developers joining MIT, but that the Foundation would continue to be supportive of the developers. Further, Fenton distanced the organization from past reports that it was seeking to form a venture-funded entity as part of a plan to spin off its development efforts.  Fenton told CoinDesk:  ""I don't see us working to directly fund core development or create a new organization to do so in the near future.""  The executive director added that the Foundation aims to pursue areas where for-profit activities aren't likely to compete with its efforts.  Outgoing interim executive director Patrick Murck, who first proposed the new development-oriented company in March, was equally supportive of the move.  ""This is a big step forward for MIT and the bitcoin project,"" he continued, adding:  ""MIT has a powerful brand and will instantly bring increased credibility and academic rigor to the bitcoin core project.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/04/24/bitcoin-foundation-director-no-plans-to-fund-core-development,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png
42426345,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJMc1h,1429887633,Bitcoin in the Headlines: Pundits Ignite Battle of the Sexes,"Bitcoin in the Headlines is a weekly look at bitcoin news, analyzing media and its impact.  In the absence of exciting product launches or massive funding rounds, the digital currency community saw renewed scrutiny in the media this week.  Mainstream outlets are still indulging in lengthy features on the subject, however, most continued to address the technology's perceived shortcomings.  The general consensus seems to be that bitcoin is still doomed for failure, although everyone seems to have a different – and equally creative – opinion as to why.  'Male domination'  Perhaps most notably, this week saw Fusion's Felix Salmon's contribution to the debate, alleging that the digital currency would fail because the ecosystem is dominated by men.  In his piece, titled ""Why Bitcoin's male domination will be its downfall"", Salmon discussed Nathaniel Popper's new book, Digital Gold, noting that it was ""as close as you can get to being the definitive account of the history of bitcoin"". In so doing, the author talks about ""misfits"" and ""millionaires"", responsible for the building, mining and hyping of the digital currency.  The post talked about Popper's failed search for bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, but focused more on his inability to find something else – prominent women in the community whom he could interview for his work.  Salmon used the observation as a springboard to hang the cryptocurrency's success or demise on a gender-based premise.  Despite the loose connection, Salmon was not alone in taking up the narrative. Shane Ferro echoed Salmon's line of thought in a Business Insider piece, writing:  ""Fusion's Felix Salmon delves into the seedy underbelly of the bitcoin world an comes up with the real problem with cryptocurrency: the community is 96% men.""  Note the use of the word ""seedy"".  Ferro's concluding statement, ""it's hard to have a currency that leaves out 50% of the population"", also raises some eyebrows as it implies no women are using the digital currency.  'Cash is here to stay'  Following the debate, Forbes' contributor Arjan Schutte argued that cash is here to stay, regardless of alternative electronic payment systems that are seeking to disrupt its market.  Schutte started by saying how ""everyone in the financial services industry is excited about the digitisation of money"", adding ""at the hand of bitcoin, or Apple Pay, or what-not – our money would be more secure, more liquid, more flexible and wield control"".  Despite his admission that a like technology could potentially disrupt the world of traditional finance, Schutte continued to note that the digital currency would never reach mainstream adoption.  He said:  ""Last year was clearly quite exciting for the bitcoin world, and I believe cryptocurrency technology remains incredibly important to the current financial services revolution. Bitcoin also offers most of the cash advantages, it's free, it offers control and anonymity. It is not universally accepted – and never will be, in my opinion. And because of that, it's not effectively liquid. So, no chance.""  Schutte's statements mirror those of bankers, who are much more willing to talk about blockchain technology and the potential applications of open ledgers than comment on the future of bitcoin.  This ongoing linguistic battler was perhaps best illustrated by this week's FutureofMoney conference and SWIFT forum.  'Gimmicky and niche'  Credit must go to BBC News's Zoe Kleinman for attempting to throw some positivity into the mix by reporting on recent bitcoin-related events in the Isle of Man, a self-governed entity in the Irish Sea.  The island has become increasingly prominent in the bitcoin and technology ecosystem. From the beginning of April, digital currency business in the Isle of Man now have to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) laws.  Known for its extensive e-gaming industry, Kleinman's piece exposed how the island is ""now hoping to give a wholesome boost to the bad boy of digital currencies, bitcoin"".  She explained her choice of words, commenting on how bitcoin often made the headlines ""for all the wrong reasons"", citing the now defunct Japanese exchange Mt Gox – which coincidently made the news this week – as an example of its association with illicit activities, adding:  ""[Bitcoin] has also gained notoriety as the currency for choice for illegal activity because bitcoin transactions can be carried out anonymously.""  At this point it is important to address that bitcoin is not wholly anonymous, as frequently misreported by some media outlets. This aside, Kleiman cites various sources who discuss issues affecting the bitcoin economy as a whole, including regulation.  Adrian Forbes, an entrepreneur whose startup TGBex sells physical bitcoin coins, told Kleinman that he was not a big fan of legislation. He continued:  ""I see bitcoin as something very niche. I don't think it requires same licences as banks and stockbrokers and hedge funs that have a thousand times as much money at stake. Bitcoin will work best in the third world first. In the west, it's a novelty, niche technology, a bit of fun. It might be advantageous in terms of speed but there's no real need for it.""  Kleinman then cited Nula Perryin, the female founder of an all-female cast taxi company, who said:  ""We do about two or three [bitcoin payments] a week ... I think it's a bit of a gimmick ... as a new firm it's something to get us noticed.""  Whether bitcoin will ever be integrated into the existing traditional financial system still remains to be seen, Perryin proves that, fad or not, women do get involved in and use the digital currency.

42426343,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJMbxh,1429834246,Dogecoin Founder Exits Crypto Community Citing 'Toxic' Culture,"UPDATE (27th April, 16:10pm GMT): Jackson Palmer indicates that his leave of absence from the crypto community includes a separation with micropayments project Neucoin. Representatives from Neucoin have not yet responded to press inquiries.      Dogecoin founder and Adobe senior manager Jackson Palmer has announced he is taking an ""extended leave of absence"" from the cryptocurrency community.  Calling the ecosystem ""toxic"", Palmer used the occasion to blast aspects of the industry, while encouraging users of dogecoin not to lose sight of its fun and playful roots. Launched in December 2013, dogecoin quickly became one of the more popular alternative digital currencies, though its community has recently seen a decline in enthusiasm.  In statements, Palmer suggested that the industry is in the midst of a period of stagnation due to the ideologies of the individuals it is attracting, as well as what he characterized as the poor quality of startups founded by new participants in the space.  Palmer told CoinDesk:  ""All in all, the cryptocurrency space increasingly feels like a bunch of white libertarian bros sitting around hoping to get rich and coming up with half-baked, buzzword-filled business ideas which often fail in an effort to try and do so.""  Palmer went on to suggest the amount of venture capital in the space, which hit record volumes in Q1 2015, was playing a role by increasing the amount of ""anger-fuelled attacks"".  ""I don't have time for it anymore,"" he added.  Demographic issues  The Australian native went on to present his opinion that digital currency participants have done little to create a community that is inclusive to all, citing the recent support of Kentucky Senator and US Tea Party member Rand Paul as evidence.  ""The community is very white male dominated, and there are a lot of anarcho-libertarian beliefs caught up in there which I really don't agree with,"" Palmer said.  The comments suggest that despite the influx of new participants into the ecosystem as a result of dogecoin's success, Palmer believes these individuals have been turned off by the activities of those in the space.  Notably, Palmer's comments echo those of observers in the space, including media outlets like Fusion, which commented on bitcoin's perceived male-dominance in a recent article.  Business follies  Palmer also took aim at businesses in the digital currency industry for its lack of progress in bringing the technology to the masses.  ""I've yet to see a bitcoin business receive VC funding that has a provable business model (ie: one that generates profit) outside of exchanges and merchant services who simply take a slice of their customers' business,"" he said.  Calling it a ""hotbed for scams"", Palmer also expressed an overall fatigue at stories indicating that people have lost money. In tweets, he further expressed his love of the traditional payments service Venmo as well as for the ecosystem as a whole, suggesting he still sees long-term value in the underlying technology.  ""Those charges merchants incur on traditional credit card payments? They exist for a reason, and that's insurance against fraud protection,"" he continued, adding:  ""I like the idea of being able to reverse charges if my bank account is ever compromised, personally.""
