42432492,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNa7Xh,1597268810,Coinbase to Offer Bitcoin-Backed Loans to US Customers,"Coinbase will allow U.S. retail customers to borrow fiat loans against as much as 30% of their bitcoin holdings in the fall, the San Francisco-based exchange announced Wednesday.      Coinbase is one of the largest and most regulated crypto exchanges to get into the lending business, and the exchange is setting conservative parameters on the product, capping credit lines at $20,000 per customer and offering an interest rate of 8% for bitcoin-backed loans with terms that are a year or less.      Customers will need to fill out a brief application but won’t have to go through a credit check, however, and borrowers will be able to receive their loans in two to three days.      “Customers may use bitcoin-backed loans in different ways depending on their financial needs, including for large expenditures like home or car repairs, financing major occasions like a wedding, or helping to manage higher-interest personal loans or credit card debt,” Max Branzburg, head of product at Coinbase, said in an emailed statement.      The product is available in only 17 states but Coinbase is pursuing licenses in other states and countries to be able to expand its lending service, he said. A waitlist opened Wednesday afternoon, including the tagline:    “Have you ever needed cash for something urgent, like a car or home repair? In the past, you might have sold Bitcoin to cover it and incurred a taxable gain or loss. Now you don’t have to.”    The exchange says it won’t reinvest the collateral elsewhere and will keep the bitcoin at the exchange, unlike some crypto lenders who rehypothecate collateral or invest deposits into perpetual swaps.      Adding a lending product can be a way for exchanges to keep customer funds at the exchange instead of moving them elsewhere, said Joseph Kelly, CEO and co-founder of crypto lender Unchained Capital. Square’s bitcoin-friendly Cash App also announced this week that it is testing a lending product that will offer customers short-term loans of between $2 and $20.      Coinbase’s low interest rate will also allow it to operate in many states that would otherwise require additional licensing to avoid usurious lending practices.      “It’s a good bull-market product when customers have excess capital they’d like to do something with,” Kelly said. “We’ve almost never seen a monopoly lending market … I’d expect other exchanges to follow suit.”      The new Coinbase product is only available in the following states: Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oregon, Texas, Virginia, Nebraska, Utah, Wisconsin and Wyoming.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/08/12/coinbase-to-offer-bitcoin-backed-loans-to-us-customers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e0190e8d2628bd29f31fc5ee8fd79ae2123d1958-1320x641.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Over on Ethereum, the fee situation continues to be problematic for traders.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $11,595 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 2.1% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $11,119-$11,624  BTC above the 10-day and slightly above the 50-day moving averages, a sideways yet turning bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin rebounded Wednesday, making gains from a 24-hour low of $11,119 on spot exchanges like Coinbase, a price point not seen since Aug. 5.      Constantin Kogan, partner at crypto fund-of-funds BitBull Capital, sees a sideways market where the price of bitcoin could go either way.      “If sellers take control of the market, it is likely that BTC will be seen at $11,390 per coin. However, there is a chance the market will overcome resistance at $12,000 and retest the annual high at $12,300,” Kogan told CoinDesk.

Increased volume in August has clearly led to a jump in volatility, added Rupert Douglas, head of institutional sales for crypto brokerage Koine.

Developers Create Scripts for Self-Verification      The average fee on the Ethereum network required to conduct transactions, including in decentralized finance, or DeFi, applications, is as high as it has ever been. It is currently at 0.009255 ETH, which is over $3.60. In Ethereum’s five-year existence as a platform, fees are now literally off the charts, according to data aggregator Blockchair.      These fees, also known as gas, are causing pain for traders. This is particularly true for market makers that have seen the price of gas double in just the past week and cannot predict just how much higher it might go in the near term due to the explosion of interest in DeFi overall.      “It’s jamming up a lot of decentralized exchanges,” said Peter Chan, lead trader for crypto trading firm OneBit Quant. “We and a few other market makers have been forced to stop quoting since gas cost is so high.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mixed Wednesday.

42432502,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNa7ph,1597260641,Token Sales Are Back in 2020,"As the price of bitcoin rises, token sales have become trendy once more.      “Ava, Dot,” tweeted ZenGo wallet CEO Ouriel Ohayon, “2017 is back. For better or worse.”      Ava Labs, the startup founded by Cornell professor Emin Gün Sirer, raised roughly $42 million in a public token sale for its Avalanche blockchain in late July.      Polkadot, the project spearheaded by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, raised another $43 million in a private sale days later.      And in the weeks since, the momentum has only seemed to grow, as congestion on Ethereum has mounted.      By Tuesday, Aug. 11, the token sale for another base-layer competitor, NEAR, overwhelmed its host platform, CoinList, forcing a delay till Wednesday.      “We have seen an unprecedented amount of traffic hit CoinList servers, resulting in a site-wide outage,” according to a CoinList email obtained by CoinDesk. “We apologize for the inconvenience. The NEAR token sale has been postponed 24 hours from its original start time.”      Wednesday’s attempt also caused multiple “errors.”      Yet, the NEAR sale – which wrapped Wednesday afternoon after $30 million was committed from 1,500 participants – still highlights the general pattern for token sales in 2020. First, the company raises venture capital and conducts a private sale, then the token-funded startup sells to the public through a platform that manages know-your-customer information and compliance.      Before the swamped CoinList offering, the NEAR protocol launched in April following a $21.6 million private token sale led by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). This week’s sale was just one of many trendy-yet-compliant token sales the CoinList platform has conducted in 2020, after cLabs raised $10 million in 12 hours back in May.      ""The numbers here are remarkable and are a testament to both the product and the community that the NEAR project has created,"" CoinList president Andy Bromberg told CoinDesk in an email.      Read more: NEAR Protocol Launches Following $21M Token Sale Led by Andreessen Horowitz      By July 2020, token projects were once again raising money across the board. Generally speaking, contemporary token startups like Ava Labs, and even competing Layer 1 projects like Chia, aim to conquer Ethereum’s market share by scaling faster and with a more decentralized network. One of the primary ways they seek to outperform the second-most-popular blockchain network is by encouraging more users to run independent nodes.      For comparison, only a small fraction of the roughly 6,000 ethereum nodes (removing the syncing nodes that are actually Ethereum Classic) are run on the user’s own hardware. According to a node operator from the German Ethereum startup Bitfly, roughly 68% of Ethereum nodes run on either Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud.      This focus on nodes represents an area where Ava Labs’ Sirer intends to outperform Ethereum. Although the Avalanche mainnet isn’t scheduled to launch until later this year, Sirer said so far “thousands” of users around the world are already running Ava Labs testnet nodes.      “These are all organic, actual users … [like] students that have heard about this revolutionary protocol,” Sirer said. “We’re running five nodes ourselves.”      Similarly, Chia is working to build a community and currently appears to have more than 433 active nodes, down from a peak of roughly 1,430 earlier this year. Out of the above-mentioned startups, so far, Chia is the only example that isn’t running a token sale in 2020.    Token Boom, Part Deux    Unlike 2017, today the norm is for token sales to be conducted through an exchange, whether it's CoinList, Gate.io or Binance.      Not every token sale raises as much as Polkadot or Ava Labs, which attracted fanfare thanks, in part, to their celebrity founders. Smaller sales also abound despite, or perhaps due to, the COVID-19 economic crisis.      Read more: Polkadot Raises $43M in 72-Hour Private Sale: Source      Along those lines, the Binance Labs-backed project Sandbox is running a token sale in August with the aim of raising $3 million. Several other crypto exchanges, including Gate.io, are also following in Binance’s footsteps to launch their own Initial Exchange Offering (IEO) platforms for new token sales. According to a Gate.io press statement, these sales raised more than $46 million so far in 2020.      As for Ava Labs, Sirer said there will be more sales to come, including a new token “targeting people that own Ethereum,” called Athereum.      “We spoon Ethereum as it exists,” Sirer said, describing how his startup will make an Ethereum-compatible bridge to encourage ETH holders to switch blockchains.      In a tale as old as pre-mines, startups still aim to become proverbial “Ethereum killers.”      With regards to the aspirational business model, Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin provided an example with ConsenSys that many upcoming founders want to emulate.      ConsenSys started as a hybrid incubator. Then, after building up the Ethereum community, ConsenSys split into a dual infrastructure provider and separate investment arm. It owns a significant stake across every sector of the Ethereum ecosystem – something Sirer may someday achieve with Avalanche, fueled by avax tokens, through Ava Labs.      “It’s a mothership that will do a bunch of spinouts,” Sirer said. “We expect to spin [projects] out to become independent efforts and have independent income models associated with them.”    New approach    Unlike the original ETH sale in 2015, and the 2017 copycats that followed, many token founders now prefer ongoing sales with controlled distribution – both for regulatory reasons and to inspire a sense of exclusivity.      Such was the case with Ava Labs, which raised venture capital (before multiple sales) from investors like Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Initialized Capital, Polychain Capital, Balaji Srinivasan and Naval Ravikant. Token sales now happen in waves, just like a Series B.      Read more: Base Layer Wars Heat Up With Another $12M Committed to AVA Labs’ Avalanche Blockchain      Looking toward the second half of the year, Sirer said he plans to support efforts to make non-fungible tokens (NFTs) for the Ava community as well. Polyient Games CEO Brad Robertson, head of a gaming startup that plans to use Ava Labs’ technology, said his team chose Avalanche over Ethereum because the former can handle more volume. The Ethereum network was infamously crippled by collectibles trading with NFTs in 2017.      Capacity hasn’t improved entirely since then. In fact, the congestion is so high these days that it’s not uncommon to pay dozens of dollars worth of crypto in transaction fees.      “We explored all of the networks on the market and feel Avalanche is best positioned to solve the scaling and transaction finality issues that have caused significant challenges to the whole DeFi ecosystem – especially with NFTs,” Robertson said.      Sirer said his startup will allow people to “issue new digital assets,” including but not limited to NFTs, and use avax tokens to “participate in the new services we’re offering.”      This is the common strategy among 2020 token projects, including most of the above-mentioned newcomers. In short, startups such as Ava Labs and cLabs (the team building the Celo network) are betting other people will build the products or services to make their blockchain platforms useful. They’re selling picks, shovels and dynamite during an emerging gold rush.      Read more: Libra Minus Facebook: Why Celo Is 2020’s Buzzy Token Project      This strategy is reminiscent of ConsenSys’ earlier token-issuance services and platforms, which dwindled when the company pivoted to infrastructure plays and equity investments.      “There are tons of different use cases for Ethereum and we support nearly all of them,” said Infura’s Michael Godsey, the ConsenSys manager spearheading infrastructure services.      Yet, the fact that there are already blockchain-agnostic services doesn’t dampen the allure of building the next ConsenSys. It looks like many entrepreneurs are hoping to mimic the wealth creation, or redistribution, witnessed during the token boom in 2017.",POSITIVE,NEAR,BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | EXCHANGE | NEAR | TOKEN SALE,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/08/12/token-sales-are-back-in-2020,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eb122fa09d98f94ae2d925259941c07ec026d5fb-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A cybersecurity analyst, using the pseudonym ""nusenu,"" said in a report this week a hacker now controls approximately 23% of the Tor Network's exit relay capacity.  The Tor Network provides anonymous internet access with voluntarily run relays that route traffic in order to obfuscate users' traceable and identifiable IP addresses.  The exit relay is the final stage that connects users to their requested websites.  Per the report, the hacker is using her/his position as a major exit relay host to stage sophisticated person-in-the-middle attacks, stripping websites of encryption and giving her/him full unrestricted access to traffic passing through her/his servers.  The malicious agent primarily focused on bitcoin mixer services, replacing wallet addresses so the mixer returns ""clean"" funds to the hacker rather than the original user.  A lack of enforcement on the Tor Network means the hacker has more than doubled her/his share of exit relays from under 10% last December, nusenu said.  It's unclear how much cryptocurrency has been stolen and whether the malicious agent is engaged in other attacks.  At least one bitcoin mixer service has added an additional security layer preventing hackers from removing their website's encryption.  The identity of the hacker remains a mystery and it isn't clear if there's any added motivation is for the attack besides stealing cryptocurrencies.

General Manager Dan Kohn said, “It is totally possible to create an app that’s horrible for privacy that is open source, but what open source does is it stops you from just claiming that it respects privacy, because any expert could check on that.”      Precedent-setting A California appeals court has ruled in favor of U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase over its decision not to support the Bitcoin Gold hard fork in 2017. Plaintiff Darrell Archer, who held 350 BTC on the exchange at the time, filed suit in 2018 alleging Coinbase had violated its contract agreement and effectively stole from clients by not supporting the fork. The court found there was no contractual agreement to support forks from third parties. Prominent industry lawyer Drew Hinkes tweeted the decision could set a precedent.      Another vehicle New York Digital Investments Group (NYDIG) raised nearly $5 million for another bitcoin investment vehicle, in what could become its third securities listing this year. The asset manager raised $190 million for the NYDIG Institutional Bitcoin Fund LP in July and $140 million for a Bitcoin Yield Enhancement Fund the month before. It’s first, the Bitcoin Fund, launched in July 2019 with six investors who invested a total of $1.45 million at the time.      Crypto monitoring The Russian agency charged with collecting data to counter financial crimes may build its own software to track cryptocurrency transactions and link them to users. The agency is seeking to reduce anonymity in crypto transfers through an artificial intelligence-based system for blockchain analysis, according to a letter from Rosfinmonitoring to Russia's Minister of Digital Development and Communications, cited by RBK. The project could cost more than $10 million to develop. A prototype for the project, dubbed ""Transparent Blockchain,"" has already been developed by the Lebedev Physical Institute based on the Bitcoin blockchain.

But their prices often fluctuate on the pubescent trading platforms of decentralized finance,” CoinDesk’s First Mover team writes. In one Aug. 10 transaction on the Ethereum blockchain, a trader appears to have used a series of transactions in tether and USDC on the decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges Uniswap, Curve and dYdX to net a tidy $40,000 profit off a $45,000 initial investment.    Op-ed    Jill Carlson, co-founder of the Open Money Initiative, teases out the similarities between the latest Robinhood Rally and the last bitcoin bull market in her latest CoinDesk column. “Crypto markets in 2016 and 2017 have in many ways foreshadowed the stock market of today. There is inspiration there, but there are also lessons,” she writes. Perhaps the biggest of all: “Markets come and go, and when the bull turns to bear some – but not all – users will go with it.”    Tech pod    CoinDesk’s Will Foxley investigates ether’s supply after a debate between Ethereum and Bitcoin advocates sprung up last week. To cut the debate short: The total supply of ether is 111,562,994 as of publishing time, according to Messari. But the larger issue is the difficulty in verifying this. Ethereum full nodes are labor intensive and third-party scripts often miss important details.

FIH is asking for more than 20 million shekels ($5.9 million) in compensation from Hogeg and his associates Tzvika Landau and Guy Elhanini, after saying it received only one payment in November 2018.  Sirin Labs co-CEO Landau told CTech the suit was a stunt to create “media pressure.”  Hogeg’s Sirin Labs raised $157 million in an initial coin offering (ICO) in early 2018 to build an Android smartphone with special cryptocurrency features including an app store for distributed apps (dapps).  Sales of this blockchain smartphone, however, were disappointing after a number of competing blockchain- and crypto- focused phones hit the market. As a result, Sirin Labs laid off 15 of its 60 employees in 2019.  Hogeg, a well-known – and controversial – international crypto mogul, has been sued multiple times both in Israel and abroad. As reported by CoinDesk, he and his other blockchain firm, Stox, were reportedly being sued for allegedly misappropriating some of the crypto millions invested in the firm.

Yet, that’s not holding back traders from pumping the token’s price from zero to $138 in the 20 or so hours since it launched. The token now is trading hands at $126, according to YAMalytics.      YAM by Yam Finance is a mishmash of DeFi products packaged in one humble tuber, generally meant to track the U.S. dollar. Or, as the founding team put it, YAM is a “minimally viable monetary experiment.”      Which can be translated to say the project has no real purpose – it’s just for fun.      That hasn’t stopped DeFi traders from piling in. YAM’s market capitalization sits at $13.5 million with some $29,361,386 in 24-hour trade volume, according to CoinGecko.    DeFi summer    The experiment joins a cornucopia of other DeFi summer “meme” coins such as Tendies and YFI.      Read more: Troll Token? Why DeFi Yield Farmers Are Now All About YFI      Its codebase pulls from multiple other DeFi projects including Compound’s on-chain governance, Curv’s governed treasury and Uniswap’s pools for token distribution (not to mention a few others).      Uniswap is where the magic is happening right now. Called yield farming, Uniswap gives token market liquidity providers a proportional amount of the platform’s native token, YAM, back for their trouble. Place a token pair like ETH/COMP in a pool and get YAMs in return, the logic runs.      Read more: What Is Yield Farming? The Rocket Fuel of DeFi, Explained      Farming has dragged these other tokens up alongside YAM. Six of the eight coins available for yield farming posted positive gains in 24 hours, with Compound’s COMP token up 49%, according to Messari (over a $300 million increase in market capitalization).    Harvesting YAMs    YAM most notably borrows from Ampleforth’s elastic supply schedule. Called a “rebase,” the project’s code will sprout new tokens at set intervals to push or pull YAM’s price back towards one dollar. Trader’s are rushing in to scoop up price gains before the rebase occurs.

Some got involved as a replacement for sports betting, given no games would be played for the foreseeable future. Others became active on the app after they watched their tried-and-true strategy of holding the S&P index meltdown over the previous weeks. It was time to take matters in hand.

Robinhood doubled its trading revenue in the second quarter, and more old-school competitors like TD Ameritrade and E-Trade saw their own numbers jump by more than 50%.      There is an exciting argument that this rise in retail trading activity will flow from the stock market into the crypto markets. Indeed, the recent upticks in prices and volumes among bitcoin, ether and a whole range of other cryptocurrencies would suggest this is already occurring.      I believe the “Robinhood Rally” is likely a harbinger of things to come for cryptocurrency. And this is true across regulatory treatment, consumer behavior and market movement.      I also believe the “Robinhood Rally” is a reflection of the cryptocurrency industry’s past. In many ways, crypto markets deserve credit for paving the way for this new trading trend.      You cannot talk about the Robinhood craze without talking about the Reddit page: wallstreetbets. WSB, as the community is often called, is a group where day traders go to brag, share memes and show off battle scars from the markets. This group has both driven and drafted off of Robinhood’s success.    The Robinhood Rally is a reflection of the cryptocurrency industry’s past. In many ways, crypto markets deserve credit for paving the way for this new trading trend.    I will confess, I was relatively late to the WSB craze. The page has been around since 2012, but I only first checked it out last year as it was starting to gain real popularity. From the moment I set eyes on the WSB conversations (if you can call them that), I was struck by clear parallels to early BitcoinTalk forums.      The tone of the group shares the same mix of irreverence, absurdity and occasional surprising displays of sophistication that featured on BitcoinTalk. On BitcoinTalk, memes like “HODL” developed organically out of “shitposts” shared by frequently pseudonymous users. On WSB, similarly pseudonymous users craft memes intentionally and stoke their virality. Their gains earn them “tendies” (yes, this is literally short for chicken tenders). They fondly refer to each other as “autists”. And not a day goes by that this group of “degens” doesn’t talk about “J. Pow” and his “money printer"".      BitcoinTalk has never just been about prices and trading and neither is WSB, though naturally these are dominant topics. WSB frequently delves into company fundamentals, politics and macroeconomic discussion, with greater and lesser degrees of accuracy.      Davey Day Trader similarly must be mentioned in any conversation about the retail rally of the last six months. The founder of Barstool Sports, the site that delivers all manner of content and news with a frat bro swagger and a Boston accent, pivoted from sports to stocks at the start of COVID-19. He streams videos of himself as he day-trades markets, hammer in hand.      Here, I could trace Davey Day Trader to the many crypto YouTube celebrities who share their technical insights and their trading strategies. These types of YouTube stars have long existed for the stock market as well. The difference with Davey – and the similarity he bears to his crypto counterparts – lies more in tone than medium. Davey Day Trader’s very logo shows him as a football star end-running an angry group of boomer bankers. It is this anti-banker, anti-establishment attitude, branding and marketing that Davey and his followers most notably share with crypto.      See also: Jill Carlson - What Goldman Gets Wrong About Bitcoin (From Someone Who Used to Work There)      WSB and Davey Day Trader are only two of several phenomena around this market that can be pattern-matched to earlier practices in cryptocurrency communities. Three years ago, during the height of the crypto bull market, the narrative of the gamification of trading emerged. Coinbase, Bitmex, Poloniex, Binance and others came under some fire for mis-incentivizing and insufficiently educating users. That foreshadowed the criticism Robinhood has faced more recently about incentives and education.      So if the products, culture and behavior of cryptocurrency are a precursor for those of mainstream markets, what is to come? I believe we will see the continued emergence of pseudonymous forums where traders will be judged on their track records (or their memes) as opposed to the prestige of their fund. Financial media of the future might look more like Crypto Twitter, dominated by animal avatars and joke names, than CNBC.      We may also see the rise of tip jars for trading insights, a regular feature on the landing pages of crypto traders and technicians. Also missing from the retail environment today is a dominant social feature. Poloniex’s trollbox was a beloved feature for traders who enjoyed real-time market banter, bragging and bad-mouthing. More privately, Telegram groups have served crypto traders for years – both in executing trades and also in sharing market insights. I am looking forward to these types of real-time chat experiences coming to mainstream retail trading.      Crypto markets in 2016 and 2017 have in many ways foreshadowed the stock market of today. There is inspiration there, but there are also lessons. Regulation will be an issue for companies building these products as consumer protection takes center stage and scrutiny from policymakers increases. Asymmetry of information, pumps-and-dumps and shameless shilling are, at a minimum, annoyances and, at most, serious ethical concerns that will plague markets as retail activity soars. And, of course, there is perhaps the biggest lesson of all for anyone building in this space: Markets come and go, and when the bull turns to bear some – but not all – users will go with it.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Jill Carlson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/08/12/what-todays-robinhood-rally-has-in-common-with-the-last-crypto-boom,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/df733186c526e2950cdeb2a0fabec361090d0892-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Michael Ackerman was the chief trading officer at Q3 – an investment club that told investors it used a proprietary algorithm that guaranteed returns trading cryptocurrencies.  Along with two other founders, Ackerman is accused of inducing around 150 investors, many of them physicians, to transfer a total of $33 million supposedly for trading crypto and making returns of up to 20% a month.  Evidence from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) shows Ackerman extracted a total of $7.5 million from Q3 between 2018 and 2019 – most of which was spent jewellery, cars, personal security, and an extensive house renovation.  Per evidence submitted by the Department of Homeland Security, Ackerman assured investors Q3 had more than $315 million in assets when in reality it had just half a million left.  The SEC, Commodity and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and the attorney for the Southern District of New York filed charges against Ackerman in February.  He stands accused of one count of wire fraud and if found guilty he could be fined up to $250,000 and face up to 20 years in prison.  Ackerman reportedly spent 16 years as an institutional broker at the New York Stock Exchange.  He entered his not guilty plea at the U.S. Southern District Court of New York on August 4.

42432483,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNa51h,1597234788,First Mover: How a DeFi Trader Made an 89% Profit in Minutes Slinging Stablecoins,"In digital-asset markets, stablecoins like tether and USDC are supposed to represent $1 of value. But their prices often fluctuate on the pubescent trading platforms of decentralized finance, or DeFi.      So cryptocurrency traders are now apparently devising strategies to profit from slinging stablecoins in these fast-growing but often janky and thinly traded markets.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      In one Aug. 10 transaction on the Ethereum blockchain, a trader appears to have used a series of transactions in tether and USDC on the decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges Uniswap, Curve and dYdX to net a tidy $40,000 profit off a $45,000 initial investment. That works out to an 89% gain in what was likely a matter of minutes.      The whole transaction can be seen on the website Etherscan, used to access data recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. Here’s that looks like:      What happened was this:      1) Trader started with roughly $45,000 in USDC tokens and borrowed another $405,000 on dYdX, for a total of $450,000 in USDC. 2) Exploiting temporary differences between the stablecoins’ face value of $1 and quoted prices, the trader was able to use Uniswap to exchange the $450,000 of USDC for $492,000 of USDT. 3) Trader swapped $492,000 of USDT for $492,000 of USDC on Curve. 4) Trader paid off the $405,000 loan from dYdX and had $87,000 USDC remaining. 5) The transactions cost about $2,000 in fees. 6) Trader netted $40,000 profit on $45,000 of initial capital.      The transaction drew eyeballs on Tuesday from flabbergasted (and perhaps admiring) Twitter users.      At first glance, the strategy appears similar to prior exploits of these largely untested DeFi systems, such as in June when a hacker drained $500,000 from the liquidity provider Balancer.      But this week’s operation appears legal, merely a 2020 version of a classic arbitrage strategy used across Wall Street and cryptocurrency markets every day.      Not bad for a few minutes of work. But just imagine how long it took for someone to figure this out.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $11,462 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $11,771 | 24-Hr Low: $11,138      Trend: Bitcoin's bullish long-term trend looks to be on a summer holiday this week, with prices generally languishing well beneath the psychological price level of $12,000.      Tuesday's 7.3% rejection from around $12,000 to a low of $11,137 hints at further downside risk on larger time frames backed by decreasing levels of weekly trade volume.      Bitcoin's weekly chart reveals the possibility of a sell-off for September – historically a bearish month for the world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap.      For example, based on data from the last three years, bitcoin has experienced losses between 20% and 36% in September after a peak in August.      The recent rejection at overbought levels near 70.00 on the relative strength index (RSI), a tool used by traders to judge market exuberance, could lead to a deeper pullback.      Immediate support stands at the former resistance level near $10,500 with long-term support hanging at $8,650 along the 50-period moving average on the weekly chart.      A short-term push by opportunistic buyers could drive prices to retest $12,000 once more.

Rosfinmonitoring, which has the power to block bank accounts within the nation, is seeking to effectively remove some of the anonymity from those making crypto transfers, the RBK news agency reported Tuesday.  Its goal is to create an artificial intelligence-based system for blockchain analysis, according to a letter from Rosfinmonitoring to Maxim Parshin, Russia's Minister of Digital Development and Communications, cited by RBK.  Under the proposal, the tool would track transactions and identify cryptocurrency services providers and ""partially"" remove anonymity from people sending bitcoin, ether, dash, omni and monero.  It would be used to investigate ""illegal"" deals with digital assets and find crypto fundraising campaigns related to money laundering and terrorism financing, the report says.  A prototype for the project, dubbed ""Transparent Blockchain,"" has already been developed by the Lebedev Physical Institute based on the bitcoin blockchain.  That has already piloted for drug trafficking investigations, says RBK, adding that Russian police have expressed interested in using the tool.  Full development of the software would require $10.4 million of government funding, $6 million of which would be needed in 2021, according to the report.

The New York-based crypto investment firm said the dollar value of total assets in GBTC went from $1.87 billion at the end of 2019 to $3.5 billion by the end of Q2 2020 – an increase of 90%.  The disclosure came in a quarterly report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last Friday. GBTC was successfully registered with the regulator in January.  Grayscale is part of Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk's parent company.  Per the filing, the bitcoin held in GBTC increased by 125,531 to nearly 387,000, a $1.15 billion increase in value based on bitcoin's spot price on June 30.

42432476,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNa4lh,1597226400,The Linux Foundation Wants Open-Source Tech to Address Future Pandemics,"The Linux Foundation, which supports open-source innovation in blockchain tech, launched the Linux Foundation Public Health Initiative (LFPHI) at the end of July. The LFPHI’s goal is to promote the use of open source by public health authorities, which can be scrutinized by anyone, to fight not just COVID-19 but future pandemics as well.      Among the seven core members of the LFPHI are Tencent, Cisco and IBM. The initiative is supporting two exposure notification projects, “COVID Shield” and “COVID Green,” with the aim of improving interoperability across initiatives in different jurisdictions.      Based on the Google and Apple Bluetooth notification systems, those apps notify people when they’ve been in close contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19. These open-source apps are built using the Apple and Google protocol for notifications, but the apps themselves are transparent and therefore more trustworthy than closed apps, where there is no insight into the code driving them.      Dan Kohn, general manager of the new initiative, sees open-source technology as necessary for a privacy-respecting exposure notification app, but not solely sufficient.      “It is totally possible to create an app that's horrible for privacy that is open source,” said Kohn. “But what open source does is it stops you from just claiming that it respects privacy, because any expert could check on that.”      In other words, the system can be not only privacy-respecting, but provably-privacy respecting.      See also: From Australia to Norway, Contact Tracing Is Struggling to Meet Expectations      Apple and Google rebranded their Bluetooth protocols as “exposure notification” after initially calling them “contact tracing.” The digital tools are meant to aid the process of human contact tracers, not replace them entirely.      Since the pandemic hit, groups around the world have rushed to develop exposure notification apps, but in many instances concerns about privacy, effectiveness and a lack of trust have led to low levels of public adoption. Australia’s contact tracing app has seen minimal use and featured bugs that limited its effectiveness. Norway paused the use of its contact tracing app over privacy concerns by its own data protection authority.      In the U.S., an uneven federal response to the pandemic has left states to fend for themselves, and public health authorities face cuts and a lack of funding.      “The public health infrastructure in the U.S. has been radically under-invested in for the last 20 years,” said Kohn. “Now there’s understandably billions of dollars flowing into that space, and as a neutral open source organization, we hope to help monitor and shape some of those investments in ways that ensure they're interoperable,” or compatible.      See also: For Contact Tracing That Preserves Privacy, Focus on Incentives      Interoperability would mean that different state-level apps in the U.S. could communicate information and data with each other.      The two LFPHI exposure notification projects are open source and meant to help develop back-end operability between different apps.      Another tool LFPHI is introducing and continually refining is a dashboard where contact tracing and exposure notification apps are tracked. The dashboard breaks down apps by whether they use Bluetooth or GPS location tracking (which is generally considered more privacy-invasive than Bluetooth), whether apps are open source and whether they’re provided by a public health authority, among a number of other categories. The tool is one of the few comprehensive databases working to track these apps in this way.      The TCN Coalition, a global group of technologists that was working to support the development of cross-compatible privacy-preserving exposure notification apps, was absorbed by the LFPHI as part of its launch.      See also: COVID-19 Tracing Apps Have to Go Viral to Work. That’s a Big Ask      Jenny Wanger, former executive director of the TCN Coalition and now head of LFPHI’s Implementers Forum, said, the U.S. needs to have more apps based on the Apple and Google protocol, given they’ll then be compatible with each other. And it needs better communication.      “One of the things that we don't know much about yet, because we haven't had the chance to experiment, is what is the messaging to really catch these as public health tools,” she said. “The same way that your seatbelt helps you, it’s a public health tool within a car. That’s how we need to be thinking about these apps on people’s phones.”      As the world grapples not just with the COVID-19 pandemic but potential future ones, initiatives like LFPHI offer one way to coordinate and build out responses to new pandemics that might arise.      “The biggest challenges around exposure notification are not the technology,” said Wanger. “The cryptography is advanced, but it’s solvable. The servers are just going to be servers. The piece that's most important for this technology to really work out is going to be public adoption and public perception.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/08/12/the-linux-foundation-wants-open-source-tech-to-address-future-pandemics,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c2b5fc2f4146ca2c1ad399f5484dcb25211f0e03-2560x1710.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Manhattan-based asset manager informed the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Monday it had raised funds for its new NYDIG Bitcoin Fund in a private placement.  Per its Form D filing, 56 investors have now committed to the fund but NYDIG has not disclosed the fund's net asset value.  The Bitcoin Fund, which will allocate combined commits into a series of investments, launched in July 2019 with six investors who invested a total of $1.45 million at the time.  The $5 million is just the initial raise and the fund is still open to additional commits.  The SEC counts private placements as exempt offerings as securities aren't publicly available and are generally only sold to accredited investors.  NYDIG has held a New York BitLicense since 2018. Benjamin Lawsky, the BitLicense's architect, joined the company nearly a year before.  Monday's raise will be the third securities offering NYDIG has held this year.  The asset manager raised $190 million for a similarly named NYDIG Institutional Bitcoin Fund LP in July, and $140 million for a Bitcoin Yield Enhancement Fund the month before.

42432477,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNa4nh,1597223396,Appeals Court Backs Coinbase in Bitcoin Gold Fork 'Breach of Contract' Lawsuit,"A California appeals court has ruled in favor of U.S cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase over its decision not to support the Bitcoin Gold hard fork in 2017.    Ruling at the state's First Appellate Court (Division One), Judge Ethan P. Schulman agreed with the summary judgment of a prior trial court that was decided in favor of Coinbase, according to a court documenthttps://www.courts.ca.gov/opinions/documents/A157690.PDF filed on Monday.  Plaintiff Darrell Archer first filed the lawsuit against Coinbase on March 27, 2018, alleging the exchange had violated its contract agreement with users over its stance on the Bitcoin Gold hard fork.  Coinbase told users it would not support the fork because the project would not release its code to the public and that, as such, it was considered a ""major security risk,"" per the filing.  Archer also alleged Coinbase had retained control over the bitcoin gold (BTG) cryptocurrency resulting from the fork for its own benefit during that time.  In a hard fork of this nature, a blockchain is split off to form a new chain (sometimes with new features) and a new cryptocurrency.  In the case of bitcoin gold, bitcoin was forked, creating BTG tokens equal in number to those owned by holders on the original chain.  While investors are automatically awarded their new duplicate holdings if they held their bitcoin in their own blockchain wallets, exchanges decide whether to support the fork and pass new coins onto customers holding assets on their platforms.  Archer – who held 350 bitcoin on Coinbase at the time of the fork – followed up his original complaint with an amendment alleging Coinbase's ""failure and refusal"" to pass on the BTG represented breach of contract, negligence and conversion (a civil law version of theft).  On the breach of contract claim, the trial court concluded that Archer had failed to establish the existence of an agreement by Coinbase to provide bitcoin gold to him following the fork.  The conversion claim failed because the existing agreement did not grant the rights for Archer to the new coins, and did not require Coinbase to support the bitcoin gold fork.  To rule otherwise would place the ""duty"" on exchanges of having to support all bitcoin forks, the judge said, quoting a similar ruling in the state of Georgia.  For the third cause of action, negligence on behalf of Coinbase, the trial court had rejected Archer's claim based on the “economic loss rule,” which the court held ruled out liability for negligence based on contractual obligations.  The appeals court has now upheld the original ruling that Coinbase's agreement with Archer contained no part requiring Coinbase to provide services for cryptocurrencies from third parties.  Carlton Fields attorney Andrew Hinks commented in a Twitter thread late on Tuesday that the case may establish precedent and has implications over the future definition of cryptocurrency as property.

42432474,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNa4dh,1597219200,"Unpacking the Avit, Avanti Bank's New Digital Asset Being Built With Blockstream","When Avanti Financial hinted at a new bank-issued digital asset late last month, it was scant on details.      “Avit has no analog,” Avanti CEO Caitlin Long said at the time. “It is a digital asset. Blockstream is our technology partner. We’re not going to announce anything more than that. One could presume that the Bitcoin blockchain will be involved.”      According to Long, the Avit will be commercial bank money or programmable electronic cash, redeemable at par with a U.S. dollar. It’s also not a security token, or a digital representation of an investment that’s expected to generate returns.      The Avit represents one of several bank-led innovations in the digital asset space. With Goldman Sachs considering its own stablecoin issuance, Sygnum issuing a stablecoin tied to the Swiss franc and other experiments, Avanti has joined a growing list of banks that want to compete with startups on digital assets.      However, Long said she believes stablecoins are not the ideal digital asset for trying to bring fiat into the crypto world.      Read more: Wyoming-Based Avanti to Open in October With a New Bank-Issued Digital Asset      Unlike cash, stablecoins are generally issued as intangible assets, which means they aren’t physical or don’t derive their value from contractual claims like stocks and bonds do. Because of this, they have uncertain legal enforceability. Circle and Coinbase, the creators of the USDC stablecoin, acknowledge USDC transactions may not be legally enforceable in the coin’s terms of service.      When stablecoins aren’t issued as intangible assets, they exist under Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code, which requires they have intermediaries. Paxos is only able to issue its paxos standard (PAX) stablecoin without a middleman because Paxos is a registered trust company.      Avit will be issued under a different portion of U.S. federal and state law that Long would not name because Avanti has a patent pending for the Avit’s design.      Read more: BCB Group Teams With Circle to Offer EU Institutions USDC Stablecoin Settlement      While stablecoins are considered “property” by the Internal Revenue Service, Long said it is likely Avit will be treated as cash by the IRS and a “cash-equivalent” by accountants, making it easier for companies and individuals to use Avits without negative financial consequences.      However, Avits wouldn’t function like digital dollars or central bank digital currencies, Long added.      “We’re a second layer down,” she said. “It’s just bank money that happens to be issued on a blockchain.”    Bitcoin rails?    According to Blockstream CEO Adam Back, the asset will be issued on Liquid – a network developed and overseen by Blockstream that is meant to move bitcoins around more quickly than the Bitcoin blockchain itself. Assets on Liquid can be traded in atomic swaps, or smart contracts that allow for exchanging assets without an intermediary. In the traditional world, ACH payments to an exchange take several days to settle.      Avit would be the first time a bank had issued a digital asset on Liquid, he added.      Generally, Liquid assets can hide the number of coins that are transferred and the type of coins that are transacted on the network, while showing users what the total supply of an issued asset is, Back said. It's not clear if Avanti will take advantage of confidential transactions, he added.      Read more: In First ‘Pure Crypto’ Hire, Silvergate Bank Recruits Blockstream Liquid Network Exec      Avanti and the Wyoming Division of Banking will see transaction details because of the Bank Secrecy Act, Long said.      “I don’t think the Bank Secrecy Act is Constitutional,” she said. “It does have significant overreach. However, we’ve also made it very clear that we will 100% comply with the law.”      While Avanti’s first announcement of Avit is a plan centered on Liquid’s Bitcoin sidechain, the bank also plans to release an Ethereum version of Avit and to support other protocols that have customer demand, she said.      “So it’s not exclusively one protocol for risk management purposes,” she said. “We will have multiple protocols upon which assets can be issued and the customer can choose.”    Stable reserves    While Avit would not be pegged one-to-one to the U.S. dollar – because it’s a new digital asset, not a digital representation of a real-world asset – the currency would be 100% backed by a reserve of traditional U.S. assets. (The bank requires a reserve of liquid traditional U.S. assets for all the assets it custodies.)      In this way it resembles target2, the real-time gross settlement system run by the European Central Bank (ECB), said Stefan Loesch, director of tokenization firm eFractio and a lecturer at Cyprus’ University of Nicosia.      The ECB system fully collateralizes all of the euros it moves around so it can settle large transactions instantly instead of at the end of the day.      Read more: ‘Game-Changer’ Retail Digital Currency Now European Central Bank’s Focus, Board Member Says      Loesch said the Avit will effectively become a dollar equivalent if the bank provides an easy pathway for it to be exchanged for a dollar.
