42398257,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT1G7,1425678327,Former GAW Manager: $8 Million ZenMiner Investment ‘A Total Lie’,"A former employee of GAW Miners is claiming that the company's previously announced $8m investment in the cloud mining firm ZenMiner never took place.  In a new post on the GetHashing forum  , former ZenMiner chief Eric Capuano set forth the allegation, the latest in a string of controversies affecting the mining firm. Capuano is among a number of individuals to depart the company earlier this year.  While rumors that the ZenMiner purchase never occurred have circulated for months, this is the first time a former GAW staff member has stated the $8m investment was a fabrication. GAW said in August that it had acquired a controlling stake in the firm, with ZenMiner ostensibly being absorbed within the broader GAW infrastructure.  Capuano noted in the post:  “The '$8m deal for the purchase of ZenMiner' that allegedly occurred between myself and Josh was a total lie. I've never owned any of the many companies operated by Josh.”  Following the publication of this story, GAW Miners issued the following statement in regards to the allegations made by Capuano:  ""It is our practice to accurately value assets and equity in the event of a corporate transfer or purchase. As a general rule as practiced by most privately-held companies, GAW does not disclose its equity structure or the details of transactions to the general public or staff, nor is the company required to. Its unfortunate this misunderstanding took place.""  'Grand scheme'  Capuano went on to say the press releases that included information about an $8m investment were published without his consent or knowledge at the time.  He declined to comment further, indicating that he may be cooperating with law enforcement officials believed to be investigating the company.  “Unfortunately, I am not at liberty to discuss all of my efforts in doing the right thing, and a quick Google search for 'GAW Miners Investigation' should answer why,” he wrote.  He also cited ‘legal threats’ as another factor in his disclosures, noting that he was likely to receive additional legal pressure following the post. GAW has issued a number of cease and desist letters in the past, including notices sent to former customers.  “Keep fighting the good fight guys, those of us that are still bound to NDAs are constantly having legal threats flung our way. I'll likely get another for making this post,” he wrote.  Revelations continue  The claim comes days after thousands of internal emails were leaked from what appeared to be a publicly available Google Group.  GAW told CoinDesk that it could not confirm the veracity of those emails, announcing earlier this week that the company had been the victim of a concerted hacking attempt.  Customer withdrawals were suspended on both the ZenMiner and PayBase platforms last month.  Recent reports  also suggest that GAW may be facing a multi-agency investigation by the US government for potential securities and money laundering violations.  CoinDesk will continue to monitor this developing story.

42398260,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT1J4,1425676919,Bitcoin Micropayments Debut on New Wave of Chat Platforms,"Two new services enabling bitcoin transactions on chat platforms have launched, with one already gaining thousands of users.  TeleBit  launched in mid-February and has attracted some 6,400 registered users, according to co-founder Jonathan Harrison. It has nearly 5,000 daily active users and has transacted 41 BTC in total, Harrison said.  The service is built on top of the Telegram chat platform, which had 50 million monthly active users in December. Users can send bitcoin through messages on the chat platform, which prides itself on its end-to-end encryption and other privacy measures.  ""Most people are getting comfortable by sending tiny amounts, so we've had a huge number of transactions,"" Harrison said.  The micropayments craze  Operating in a similar way is the Bitcoin TipBot for Slack which is created by blockchain explorer and wallet firm BlockTrail.  The BlockTrail bot is an open-source programme that works with Slack, a chat platform aimed at businesses. Once installed on a particular company's Slack account, users there can send and receive bitcoin by issuing commands to the bot.  Slack reported 500,000 daily users this month.  The Slack bot was written in two hours during a January hackathon in Amsterdam, where BlockTrail is based, said the firm's co-founder Boaz Bechar. The code was published to the open-source code-sharing platform GitHub last week.  Both TeleBit and the BlockTrail tipping bot build on the micropayments trend sparked by market leader ChangeTip, which saw that startup's transaction volume grow explosively to processing as much as 10,000 transactions in a day, though the daily average is lower.  ChangeTip lets its users transfer bitcoins using social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, although users can only claim the funds by registering for a ChangeTip account.  ChangeTip's success even saw off a challenge from Coinbase, the best-funded company in the bitcoin space with $107m raised, which retired its own tipping feature after mounting a brief challenge at the end of last year. As it rolled down the shutter, Coinbase said it would direct the 10,000 users it gained on its tipping platform to ChangeTip.  Tiny payments could bring bitcoin success  But don't call TeleBit another micropayments service.  Harrison rejects the premise, claiming that transacting bitcoins on messaging platforms represents a different market than doing so on social media platforms.  Harrison said the key difference is the user experience. Whereas ChangeTip routes you to a website to claim a bitcoin deposit, TeleBit lets you move your funds from within the chat platform.  ""You can't withdraw bitcoin directly from Twitter [on ChangeTip] ... You can use TeleBit straight away and you never have to leave Telegram to do so,"" he said. ""Ultimately one day, most IM apps will be bitcoin wallets as well.""  Harrison said he is focused on growing user numbers for TeleBit now, so he isn't charging any fees. In fact, he even subsidises miner fees incurred by TeleBit users who send funds to a non-TeleBit wallet. Future revenue streams for the service include ""non-intrusive"" advertising, delivered inside the automated Telegram chats the service generates.  For BlockTrail, its Slack tipping bot isn't so much a product as an experiment exploring the novelty of bitcoin tipping. The BlockTrail team itself uses the bot internally mainly for ""jokes"", Bechar added. But don't let the outward frivolity of tipping mask its potential for disrupting online transactions, the BlockTrail founder said.  ""There are very few channels where you can do [micropayments] – SMS used to be a big option but carriers took a lot in fees, so cryptocurrency makes it so much easier and more efficient,"" he said.  Micropayments continue to be held out as a way for bitcoin or other digital currencies to overturn the established financial order. The head of the influential think-tank the Aspen Institute, Walter Isaacson, said in December that bitcoin micropayments could ""upend"" the current financial system.  ChangeTip itself raised $3.5m in funding from Pantera Capital, 500 Startups and others on the back of rising user-growth in December. It reported 30,000 users at the time of its funding announcement.

42398255,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT1E9,1425670299,Bitcoin in the Headlines: The 'Battle' Continues,"Bitcoin in the Headlines is a weekly look at global bitcoin news, analysing media coverage and its impact.  The media seems to have hit on a winning formula for bitcoin coverage.  Just when you thought publications might be tired of framing bitcoin as an endless debate, The Wall Street Journal threw a spanner into the works with a prominent feature on the subject in its print version.  Still, while the Journal did attempt to put bitcoin in the spotlight, most outlets continue to link the digital currency to less desirable trends.  Don't worry, there's been plenty of talk relating to drugs, crime and terrorism in this week's recap.  'Bitcoin Battle'  The Wall Street Journal's exposé, aptly titled ""Do Cryptocurrencies Such as Bitcoin Have a Future?"", delved into the future of money.  Though a bit of a departure from its more topical online coverage, it seems the Journal has now also taken to informing its print audience about bitcoin, starting with the basics.  So, what is bitcoin? Well, according to Campbell R Harvey, the digital currency is a technology.  He said:  ""Don't judge bitcoin by its early inevitable problems.""  Harvey explained that it does not matter whether bitcoin is backed by a central authority or not. Bitcoin, he argues, exists because users assign value to it, adding that ""to say that it violates the rules of finance because it lacks a central issuer is problematic on many levels. Governments don't 'guarantee' stability of their currencies – look at the ruble and Swiss franc"".  The feature wasn't all positive, however.  ""As a currency, bitcoin violates all the rules of finance"", retaliated Eric Tymoigne, an assistant professor of economics at Lewis Clare College, describing the digital currency as a commodity, and ""not a financial instrument"".  ""Its value fluctuates widely, in line with changing views regarding the overall usefulness of the bitcoin payment system and speculative manias surrounding such views.""  Tymoigne concluded: ""As an alleged alternative currency, bitcoin is unacceptable.""  'Bitcoin schizophrenia'  Elsewhere, columnists were giving voice to long simmering opinions on the industry.  Mark Gilbert, a Bloomberg View columnist, for example, dedicated a piece to the challenge bitcoin poses to central banks, asking ""Should they ban it, regulate it, embrace it, undermine it or just ignore it?""  Gilbert explains that, in his view, banks would be best to let Darwinism take its course, and resist the regulatory impulse to interfere with either bitcoin's survival or demise. And if it [bitcoin] lives, they should simply step aside and celebrate innovation rather than try to lock block its progress.  Though Bloomberg was perhaps more progressive, The New York Times seemed to take a bit of step back running an article entitled ""U.S. Auction Suggests Lingering Interest in Bitcoin"" filled with sentences suggesting bitcoin may be a lingering fad.  The piece started off by saying: ""The falling price of bitcoin has not entirely quashed investor enthusiasm for the virtual currency.""  The curious entrance was echoed elsewhere in the article, which takes place after years of ups and downs in the price of the volatile currency, all of which have arguably left enthusiasm unaffected.  Quibbles aside, the author concluded the piece optimistically, writing:  ""While the bitcoin frenzy appears to have subsided the fact that the latest auction had more bidders than the one in December should provide some hope to bitcoin supporters.""  Bitcoin and terror together again  One of the biggest lightning rods in coverage this week, however, came from a new media startup.  BuzzFeed News published a piece titled ""Teenage Bitcoin Afficionado Reportedly Arrested for Helping Man Join ISIS"", picking up on a small detail in a previous Washington Post report that a Northern Virginia high school student had been taken into custody by the FBI.  How is this linked to bitcoin you ask? Simple. According to BuzzFeed, the teen's online presence showed that he had an interest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  He was allegedly linked to a bitcoin startup aimed at the Middle East, ""the first bitcoin exchange directed primarily at the Arab market, featuring a full Arabic site and exchange, along with dealings in currencies found in the Middle East"", the article said.  The article provided evidence of an ongoing trend that links bitcoin afficionados and terrorism, though it was far from the only article that gave coverage the subject matter, as ChangeTip was notably involved in a minor scandal involving the Islamic State.  At the time of press, a simple search on Google with the terms ""bitcoin"" and ""terrorism"" brought over 30,000 results. Perhaps it is unfair to solely blame the media.

42398253,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT1AD,1425663050,"BTCPoint Creates 10,000 Bitcoin-Enabled ATMs Using Spanish Bank Network","Bitcoin-to-cash withdrawals are now available at 10,000 additional bank ATMs in Spain.  The development is the result of agreements between BTCPoint, major national bank Banc Sabadell and Hal-Cash that will see the bitcoin service integrating with Banc Sabadell, Banco Popular, Abanca and EVO Bank units.  ""Once you send your bitcoin to our address, you’ll receive a text message with a code and with that code you can go to any ATM and receive cash right away,"" co-founder and COO Alex Lopera explained, adding that customers don't need to have a credit card or account with the banks in order to receive cash.  Though similar to a service offered by Bit2Me, BTCPoint is launching with zero commission. Bit2Me charges a 1% commission per transaction.  The move marks a shift in strategy for BTCPoint, which also manufactures two-way bitcoin ATMs, a process that Lopera described as ""painful"". BTCPoint has produced roughly 10 units in total.  Lopera told CoinDesk:  ""If we wanted to scale and become global, it makes more sense to really go after banks. They already have the infrastructure.""  Founded in 2014, BTCPoint was created by a team including Lopera, CEO Borja Rossell; product manager Albert Caus; and CTO Dario Nieuwenhuis, all of whom are from Spain.  The move comes amid a notale shift in the bitcoin ATM space, with major providers voicing that they intend to focus more on software solutions that bring bitcoin to existing machines.  Bridging the gap  To access the service, BTCPoint users enter the amount of money they'd like to withdraw from an ATM using the application and send bitcoin to a company address.  Next, users receive an SMS and a PIN code, input the PIN code into an ATM on the network and withdraw their funds. The service today is one-directional, with users only being able to withdraw cash from units, though Lopera said BTCPoint is working on solutions that diversify its service.  ""We are focusing on changing bitcoin into cash, and we’re also talking with different credit card processors, who could enable the buy option so you can buy at a very low fee,"" he said.  Lopera suggested BTCPoint is in talks with US and Latin American banks as a means to expand its service.  Remittance beginnings  Going forward, BTCPoint aims to deliver on its mission to bridge the gap between physical and digital currency ATMs by building up a remittance network with these tools.  ""If you have ATMs that are working with your platform in Mexico, and you have ATMs that are already working in Spain, it’s very easy for you to send money from bitcoin to Mexico,"" Lopera said as an example of how BTCPoint aims to scale.  Already, the service allows international cell phone users to interact with its service.  ""The only thing they need when travelling to Spain is a bitcoin wallet with bitcoins and they'll be able to sell them for cash at any of our affiliated ATMs,"" Lopera added.  Lopera suggested the service would seek to expand globally so that users in more places can send money with only a mobile phone, concluding: ""That’s where we’d like to be a year or two from now.""

42398243,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT15I,1425662422,Top Japanese Investor: Cryptocurrencies Key to Financial Revolution,"Veteran Japanese VC Kazutaka Muraguchi says cryptocurrencies are the key to a ""worldwide financial revolution"", following his firm's ¥100m ($828,000) investment in Japan's latest crypto exchange.  Speaking to CoinDesk, the Nippon Technology Venture Partners (NTVP) general partner said he jumped at the opportunity to invest in Osaka-based platform Zaif as he had been interested in currency innovation for 15 years.  The exchange, run by Tech Bureau, lets users trade in Japanese yen, bitcoin and monacoin, a cat-themed cryptocurrency. It could become the hub that ""connects Japan to the global cryptocurrency market,"" he said.  Founded in 1998, NTVP is known for its investments in mobile, gaming and tech, including the popular mobile gaming platform Mobage-town.

Bitcoin in Japan  However, there is still work to do.  ""Due to the strength of Japan's existing banking system, the field of cryptocurrency still lags behind. However, with perseverance it is our intention to create a level playing field through this frontier field [of cryptocurrency],"" continued Muraguchi.  Tech Bureau's CEO, Takao Asayama, agrees with Miraguchi in that Japan has been relatively slow to adopt cryptocurrencies.  Asayama said:  ""In Japan, no one talks about bitcoin 2.0, and people have little interest in owning bitcoin themselves. Unfortunately, the first newsworthy event related to bitcoin in Japan was the collapse of Mt Gox, which has fuelled a lot of negative coverage in the media.""  The CEO continued: ""By providing the most-user friendly cryptocurrency exchange on the market, we are creating an environment that encourages Japanese people to increasingly rely on cryptocurrencies in the future.""

42398259,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT1H6,1425637943,Jim Harper: 2015 Will Rebuild the Bitcoin Foundation,"""Campaigns tend be about high drama and broad statements of principle.""    That’s Jim Harper, the Bitcoin Foundation’s newly elected board member and former global policy council, discussing the recent election in which he and Olivier Janssens triumphed amid controversies over voter turnout and cries that the organisation should be disbanded.    Harper is keen to move the Bitcoin Foundation on to more practical concerns when he joins the seven-person board that will include BTC China CEO Bobby Lee; Ribbit Capital's Meyer 'Micky' Malka; venture capitalist Brock Pierce; BitPay's Elizabeth Ploshay; Janssens; and soon, a member to be elected to a new international seat.  During a new interview with CoinDesk, Harper addressed a matter close to home, the stability of the organisation itself. Harper was notably let go from the organisation in December amidst a pivot by the foundation to focus solely on core development.  Harper told CoinDesk:  ""People have left good jobs to come to the foundation, people have moved to London to join the foundation, and the foundation didn’t keep them on. As with a bitcoin business, this thing has to be well run so it doesn't do damage.""  Harper indicated he has yet to see the organisation's financials, but that he believes it needs to first stabilize in order to ensure a strong, committed team.  ""I think it’s going to be a rebuilding year for the Bitcoin Foundation,"" he said.  Methodology candidate  Harper's not short on ideas for how the foundation might change, though he cautions that as a single board member his influence is limited. One effort that will not come back as a result of his return is a public policy initiative.  ""Some people thought that Jim was the policy candidate, in fact, I’m the methodology candidate, and that may give way to policy, but that’s not a given,"" Harper said, adding that ultimately the organisation should be subject to the wishes of its constituency.  What Harper means by methodology, is that he believes research will be key to helping the foundation grow and use its resources more wisely. He pointed to a 2014 studyhttps://bitcoinfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Bitcoin-Risk-Management-Study-Spring-2014.pdf he was commissioned to conduct, which sought to determine the biggest threats to bitcoin as an example of the kind of initiatives he'd like to see the organisation embrace.  ""That was a good study, and I think it’s a good methodology for deciding how to guide us,"" Harper said. ""The foundation didn’t really use the study, which was disappointing, but I think that kind of thing could have done a better job of bringing the membership of the foundation into the process so that their knowledge can help animate the focus of the foundation.""  Harper indicated that he'd like to repeat this study as a board member, adding that while he ""can't guarantee"" it will happen, he doesn't foresee any roadblocks.  ""Running a non-profit on a methodology is hard to do, but I think it’s possible, and I’d like the foundation to do it,"" he said.  Public resources from the foundation election suggest that this platformhttps://bitcoin.consider.it/jim-harper resonated with voters.  No return  Harper also distanced himself from certain comments made during the campaign, particularly statements that seemingly spoke out against the foundation's pivot as a return to form.  While he still believes in a broad vision for the foundation that includes ""core development, education and public policy"", he voiced his concern that returning to past initiatives might harm progress.  ""I was pretty clear about that, I don’t think the foundation can go back into the role. It’s more important to make sure all the stuff that’s in place is well done rather than going back to public policy,"" he continued, adding:  ""Going back can be worse than nothing. I don’t think that’s in the near-term cards.""  He also retracted statements that seemed to suggest the foundation should continue to help educate lawmakers, characterizing them as more academic. Still, he recognizes that both his and Janssens' election to the board can be read as ""non-endorsements of the pivot"".  ""We were two candidates that weren’t supportive of that, so take that as you will, that’s more political than interesting,"" he said. ""But, I think the most important thing is the foundation has to develop validity and stability so people know what is, know what it does and even people internally have a sense of direction.""  Member focus  Rather, Harper suggested the foundation needs to work more to empower its members, who he described as incentivized to work toward its goals.  Calling the membership the foundation's best ""untapped resource"", he suggested he may seek to encourage the organisation to use its influence with its 1,523 members to counter its own diminished resources.  ""The foundation hasn’t really asked them to do very much,"" Harper said. ""They’re not there to sit back and watch, they're here to help build this vertical.""  Harper also intends to increase communications with his constituency, a task he'd previously indicated was among his campaign promises.  ""I think that [the board] sounds receptive so far, Olivier also has his own thoughts in that area, so we’ll figure out what works for everyone,"" Harper said. ""I’m pretty confident the transparency of the board is going to improve quickly.""  Visible presence  Harper also addressed the question of how visible he aims to be in the community, especially given the relative public silence from Lee and Pierce on matters relating to the foundation.  For example, Harper indicated that Lee and Pierce are more focused on interacting with corporate members, and that the nature of his position, as well as that of Janssens' would naturally lead to more frequent visibility.  ""We’re both individual members and we’ll be naturally suited toward communicating with the broader membership,"" Harper said.  Above all, however, Harper sought to caution that foundation members shouldn't expect the organisation to change overnight as a result of the new board members.  Ending on a pragmatic note, he concluded:  ""A board membership is not a presidency, so neither one of us can implement our vision. We have to work with the other members and people shouldn’t be surprised that we don’t get all that we tried to achieve, that’s the nature of the board.""
