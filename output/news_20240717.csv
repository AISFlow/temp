He has again reaffirmed his bullish stance and mentioned when exactly the flagship crypto will hit this unprecedented price target. When Bitcoin Will Rise To $1 Million Mow mentioned that he is still certain that Bitcoin will reach $1 million and added that the flagship crypto will reach this price target within a year. Mow had previously explained why he believes that BTC can reach such an ambitious price target. Back then, he alluded to the fact that Bitcoin’s demand was outpacing its supply. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Multiple God Candles For XRP, How High Can It Go? He also highlighted the Bitcoin halving which he noted was going to bring about a supply shock for the crypto token. Based on these reasons, Mow expects BTC’s price to “react accordingly” as demand continues to outpace supply. The Bitcoin maximalist also mentioned the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have been accumulating a significant amount of the BTC supply, as another factor that would contribute to BTC’s meteoric rise. Mt. Gox’s Bitcoin repayment is an event that is believed could impact the crypto’s price negatively since it could lead to more Bitcoin supply dumped on the market. However, Mow doesn’t believe that is going to happen. He mentioned that only about 20% of the defunct crypto exchange’s BTC will hit the market while the remaining 80% will be moved to cold storage or borrowed against. Mow also had something to say about when exactly the crypto bull run will begin. He mentioned that the bull run starts when Bitcoin is at $100,000. He added that the recent market downtrend is just the “unwinding of the fakery to make retail think Bitcoin is over.” Based on predictions made by crypto analysts like PlanB, BTC could hit $100,000 this year. Interestingly, PlanB also shares a similar sentiment to Mow that Bitcoin can hit $1 million by next year. He claimed that the crypto token could rise to this price level based on the stock-to-flow (STF) indicator. More Conservative Price Targets For BTC Other crypto analysts have given more conservative price targets for Bitcoin in this bull run, although a major consensus seems to be the fact that the flagship crypto will more than likely rise above $100,000. Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto once mentioned between $138,000 and $150,000 as “optimal targets for Bitcoin in this bull run.” Related Reading: Analyst Says Solana Price Could Rise 450% To $840 – Here Are The Drivers Crypto analyst Cryptorphic also mentioned that BTC could rise to as high as $156,000 by next year, while Skybridge Capital CEO Anthony Scaramucci expects Bitcoin to rise higher and reach $170,000 sometime in 2025. Cryptoquant’s CEO Ki Young Ju predicted that BTC could reach $265,000 in this market cycle based on the Hashrate/Market Cap ratio, which he claimed supports such a parabolic rise.

Once these documents get approved by the financial regulator, the funds can hit the market.  Two sources familiar with the matter told CoinDesk earlier this week that the SEC will likely do this next week on Tuesday.  Applicants seeking to issue exchange-traded funds tied to Ethereum's ether {{ETH}} have now submitted their final documents needed to launch the funds, probably next week.  Asset managers including BlackRock, Fidelity, 21Shares, Grayscale, Bitwise and Invesco Galaxy – who are all in the race to launch ether ETFs in the U.S. – submitted amended S-1 filings on Wednesday.  Two industry sources previously told CoinDesk that U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission staff advised them to file final amendments by Wednesday and that the applications may be deemed effective – essentially, approved – by Monday, with trading to begin Tuesday.  In the filings, the prospective issuers revealed the final details of the fund structures, including management fees, which turned out to be relevant for investors when choosing which spot bitcoin ETF they would invest in when they debuted early this year. Experts have said that the fee war in this round of launches would be similar to the competitive landscape then, when issuers kept lowering their fees to compete with other funds.  One similarity so far is Grayscale's distance from its competitors. The asset manager decided to charge a significantly higher fee of 2.5% on its main product than others. Its Mini Ethereum Trust, however, is set at 0.25%, in line with others.  ""I'm not sure what Grayscale's strategy is here,"" said industry commentator Scott Johnson in a post on X. ""Feels like they started with the right idea, then it got botched somewhere along the way. Investors selling ETHE are probably not going to be charitable with your mid-price mini option after you stick them with a 10x fee and force them to realize gains.""  ""Honestly, they might have screwed themselves worse than GBTC. I didn't think that was possible,"" he wrote, referring to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) seeing billions of dollars of outflows since it was converted to an ETF in January as other bitcoin ETFs started trading.  BlackRock and Fidelity will also charge 0.25%, while 21Shares set its fee at 0.21%. Bitwise, VanEck and Invesco Galaxy are at the lower end of the spectrum at 0.2% while Franklin Templeton will charge 0.19%.  ProShares had not filed an amendment revealing its fee as of press time.  Mini ETF launch incoming?  The SEC also approved 19b-4 forms for applications from Grayscale to launch a mini ethereum exchange-traded product and ProShares to launch a spot ethereum ETF on Wednesday.  Both companies are working with NYSE Arca as their exchange partner that will actually list the products. The SEC previously approved 19b-4 forms from NYSE Arca, Cboe and Nasdaq for the various applications for spot ether ETFs near the end of May, resolving a procedural hurdle and giving the strongest indication thus far that it would ultimately approve the spot ether ETF applications.  The timing of Wednesday's 19b-4 approvals suggests that Grayscale and ProShares may also be able to launch their products at the same time as the other applicants. Industry sources previously told CoinDesk they expected these products to launch next Tuesday.  If Grayscale can launch its mini ether ETF on Tuesday, it'll do so before it receives approval to launch a mini bitcoin ETF. The company filed to launch a mini bitcoin ETF in April, revealing earlier this year it would charge a 0.15% fee – in contrast to the mini ether product's 0.25%.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | ZRX,"Helene Braun, Nikhilesh De",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/07/17/all-ether-etf-applicants-have-submitted-their-final-forms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/27b53cfa82766953ae1a35280e08d80682d4961f-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ripple-SEC Legal Dispute Continues Over the past week, XRP has experienced a substantial rally of over 40%, reaching a current trading price of $0.6161. This marks the highest level XRP has reached since April, while the overall market has seen a more modest increase of around 12% during the same period. The legal dispute stems from a lawsuit filed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Ripple Labs in 2020. The SEC alleged that Ripple violated its rules by conducting an “unregistered securities offering” through the sale of XRP. In a blow to the SEC, a US District Judge ruled in July last year that the sale of XRP to retail investors on exchanges did not constitute investment contracts. Related Reading: Silicon Valley Using Trump For A Bitcoin Pump Play? Mark Cuban Weighs In Adding fuel to the speculation is a “closed meeting” on the SEC’s website scheduled for July 18.. Although an SEC spokesperson declined to comment, investors and traders interpret this as a potential development in the status of XRP. However, former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel dismissed rumors of an imminent settlement between the SEC and Ripple, stating that closed-door meetings of this nature have been routine since the lawsuit was filed. Pro-XRP lawyer Fred Rispoli also weighed in, expressing skepticism about the likelihood of a pre-judgment settlement. While negotiations on outstanding arguments are possible, Rispoli added that a resolution before the court’s ruling seems unlikely. Rispoli speculates that Judge Analisa Torres will order a penalty of less than $25 million and no disgorgement against Ripple, contrasting with the SEC’s request for a $102.6 million fine. Ripple, on the other hand, has proposed a penalty of $10 million. XRP Price Breakout, Analyst Anticipates Tremendous Gains With the XRP price hitting a 4-month high after a sharp downtrend, crypto analyst Dark Defender has stated that the token could be on its way to explosive gains if one key level is breached during the current rally. In a social media post, Dark Defender highlighted that XRP has entered the qualification mode by rebounding from the last “frontier” at $0.3917. According to Dark Defender, if XRP manages to rise above $0.6649, it could embark on a journey towards the $18 to $36 price range, meaning a 2810% jump to the former and a potential 5740% rise to the latter. Related Reading: $174 In Sight: Analyst Projects Major Surge For Solana (SOL) In addition, the token has crossed its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), marked by the yellow line on the daily XRP/USD chart, which was previously a notable resistance wall.

On July 5, the second dip dropped to about $123, thereby verifying the trend before recovering. #Solana appears to be forming a W pattern, which suggests $SOL will surge toward $174! pic.twitter.com/OxXODWi1yA — Ali (@ali_charts) July 15, 2024 Forecast And Investor Emotion Driven by the strong technical basis set up by the “W” formation and backed by optimistic indications generally, Martinez forecasts Solana may reach $174 in the near term. This mark marks a notable comeback from the lows of mid-June, therefore highlighting SOL’s tenacity and future for more expansion. Current estimates indicate Solana will climb by about 14%, maybe reaching $185 by August 16, 2024. Standing at 69 (Greed), the Fear & Greed Index shows rising market confidence; SOL records 18 out of 30 (60%) green days within 4.66% price volatility over the last month. Technical Indices Verify Upward Trajectory Solana, trading at $157 right now, has showed tenacity in keeping its rising trend with a 14% rise over the previous seven days. With the altcoin swinging between its upper and middle bands, indicating ongoing rising momentum, the Bollinger Bands (BB) indicator highlights SOL’s positive posture. Early trading hours saw SOL momentarily dip the middle band, suggesting a minor stop before maybe picking back on its ascent towards the $174 resistance level. This positive view is supported by the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, which shows a significant crossover whereby the MACD line stayed regularly above the signal line for a long time. Related Reading: $50 Injection? Analyst Bullish On Injective After 25% Surge Green bars on the MACD histogram are also intensifying concurrently, indicating strong purchasing pressure and supporting SOL’s upward trend. The stochastic RSI indicator, meantime, has often shown overbought conditions—many peaks over 80—reflecting consistent demand and investor optimism in SOL’s future. With technical signs and market mood supporting more increases, Solana’s explosive ascent towards the $174 goal marks a turning moment for the altcoin.

31129388,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=630290,1721245643,Silicon Valley Using Trump For A Bitcoin Pump Play? Mark Cuban Weighs In,"As the 2024 presidential race heats up, a new debate has emerged regarding Silicon Valley’s recent support for former President Donald Trump’s comeback bid for the White House. According to billionaire investor Mark Cuban, this support may have less to do with Trump’s pro-crypto regulatory stance and more with a calculated play to “pump” the Bitcoin price. Cuban Sparks Debate On Trump, Silicon Valley, And Bitcoin In a series of social media posts on Wednesday, Cuban highlights that Trump’s pro-crypto stance, while favorable, may not directly impact the price of cryptocurrencies. Instead, Cuban argues that the crucial factor lies in the potential changes at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that could facilitate the easier operation of crypto businesses. Related Reading: PEPE Explosion Imminent: Analyst Predicts Price Will Rocket To $0.00004128 ATH But what could drive Bitcoin’s price, Cuban said, are lower tax rates and tariffs, which historically have had an inflationary effect. “It’s a Bitcoin play,” he added, referring to Trump’s tax agenda and Silicon Valley’s appeal to those policies. Drawing attention to the global uncertainty surrounding the geopolitical role of the United States and the potential impact on the US Dollar as the prevailing reserve currency, Cuban suggests that these factors align favorably for a significant acceleration in BTC’s price. BTC As Global Currency? Cuban also emphasized the global nature of the Bitcoin market and the finite supply of 21 million BTC, making it a compelling asset if geopolitical uncertainty and the decline of the US Dollar lead to a global search for a “safe haven” currency. “How high can the price go. Way higher than you think.” Cuban added. Although Cuban, who is also a long-term crypto investor, admits that such a scenario may seem remote in the US economy, he points out that countries struggling with hyperinflation have already seen a rise in adopting Bitcoin to safeguard savings. Cuban further said: And if things really go further than we can imagine today (and I’m not saying they will. Just that this has a possibility somewhere above zero) , then BTC becomes exactly what the Maxis envision. A global currency. Related Reading: Pro-XRP Lawyer Debunks Ripple-SEC Settlement Rumor For Tomorrow Recent reports indicate that Trump’s announcement of Sen. JD Vance as his running mate has bolstered his support among Silicon Valley conservatives. Notably, figures within the crypto industry have also gravitated toward Trump, expressing frustration with the Biden administration’s approach to digital asset regulation. Kraken’s co-founder and chairman, Jesse Powell, donated $1 million to Trump’s 2024 election campaign, while the Winklevoss twins, co-founders of Gemini exchange, and Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, have voiced their support for Trump, citing his progressive stance on crypto as a key factor. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $64,560, marking a 1-month high after a steep decline since June that saw the price of the largest cryptocurrency hit a 6-month low of $53,500.

42417670,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZUbt,1721243471,Why We Chose Sui Over Solana for Our DePIN,"Looking at crypto news headlines, it would seem initially that Solana has firmly established itself as the home of DePIN. From Hivemapper to Helium, some of the most well-known DePIN projects are built on this blockchain. But when we explored Solana as a blockchain on which to build our project, something didn’t quite add up. So, after getting our analytical hats on and running the requisite due diligence checks, we decided to go with Sui over Solana.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's new DePIN Vertical, covering the emerging industry of decentralized physical infrastructure.  The first thing that gave us pause was the prevalence of outages on Solana. In 2022 – an annus horribilis for the crypto industry as a whole – Solana seemed to be going down every other month. But even after the Firedancer testnet validator client went live (which was meant to put a stop to any further outages), the network still went down for nearly five hours in February 2024. It may have been a fluke, but those odds didn’t fill us with confidence.  On top of this, Solana seemed to be struggling to handle its own increase in popularity. Several times this year, the network has become congested due to memecoin mania, as well as Bitcoin-like Ore mining, which quickly grew in popularity. In the last few months, X has been exploding with users complaining about transactions failing, as traders of memecoins like BONK and WIF flooded the network. This sort of frenzy is a good test of a network’s ability to handle real trading volume – and I can’t tell you with absolute confidence that a different blockchain wouldn’t struggle – but for us, this was another red flag.  When it comes to DePIN, and especially projects like ours, which handles huge amounts of data in real time, the two main things we require from a blockchain are reliability and scalability. When Solana first emerged as an “Ethereum-killer,” this was the most exciting thing about it – its promise to reliably process upwards of 50,000 transactions per second. In reality, though, it is of course far less than that under real-life conditions. For what we do at Chirp, that simply isn’t enough.  So for these main reasons, when we began our search for “the Holy Grail” of DePIN blockchains, we decided to look beyond the obvious choice of Solana. We knew this meant venturing into somewhat unchartered waters. After all, among the bigger and more established Layer1s, Solana really would be the top pick for speed, as well as low transaction costs (which was another one of our key criteria). This search led us to Sui – a blockchain that went public on May 3, 2023.  We believe Sui truly improves on the design of the blockchains from the last bull market, in our view getting closer than any other Layer1 to solving the infamous Blockchain Trilemma. It is cost-efficient, decentralized and secure. It boasts 100 validators, distributed across the globe, and its throughput has ranged from 10,871tps to a whopping 297,000tps. I’m an engineer, so I know not to expect the best performance all the time – in fact, I’m far more inclined to anticipate the worst result in real-life scenarios. But even 10,000tps is still pretty exceptional.  On top of this, Sui’s Mysticeti upgrade – which recently went live on testnet – is set to make the network even faster, bringing consensus latency down 80% to 390 milliseconds (ms). For those without the technical background to give this number context, suffice to say, it’s really fast. In fact, I believe this will make Sui the fastest blockchain in the DeFi space. I’ll give credit where credit is due, though: Solana already boasts a consensus latency of around 400ms, so the difference between the two will be tiny.  What Sui does still hold over Solana, though – apart from transaction processing speed – are the lower costs and its ultra-secure programming language, Move. Cost-wise, the average gas fee on Sui for the last 30 days is just 0.003932633 SUI (with SUI price currently sitting at around $0.86), while average fees on Solana have been as high as $0.03 at various points during recent months. Still a fraction of the fees on Ethereum, of course, but these things do add up.  Read more: Max Thake - DePIN: It's Time for Crypto to Get Real  Of course, we’re not quite comparing apples with apples here. Though the number of active wallets on Sui and Solana is actually comparable (despite Solana being a more established blockchain), Sui hasn’t experienced anything similar to Solana’s memecoin trading frenzy. But we can only draw conclusions from the facts we have before us, and so far, Sui’s lower gas fees have really helped us keep a lid on costs.  And last, but not least, Sui was a good fit because of the wide range of tools it offers to support our growing Internet of Things (IoT) network. For example, the Sui Name Service (SNS) – a naming system that assigns unique identifiers to blockchain addresses allowing for naming and, therefore, easy tracking of on-chain IoT devices – goes a long way toward creating a more transparent and efficient system of interconnected devices. This allows us to achieve our vision of building a network that is device-agnostic to connect as many devices to the blockchain as possible.  A sort of Solana 2.0, if you will  In a nutshell, those are the key reasons we chose Sui over Solana. That’s not to say that Solana doesn’t offer many of the attributes required for a strong and resilient DePIN network. It’s still among the fastest blockchains in the industry and has been implementing upgrades like Firedancer testnet that are designed to make it more reliable. It is also an established Layer1 that has already weathered one bear market (and, in fact, rose from the ashes after the collapse of FTX). So it’s a solid choice for future DePIN projects.  However, in an ecosystem that innovates as quickly as blockchain does, there will always be innovative developments that improve on existing offerings and surpass them. We believe Sui is exactly that – a sort of Solana 2.0, if you will. And if an early-stage DePIN project comes to me in search of advice, I won’t hesitate to recommend Sui as the top choice for a robust and scalable network.

""In this post, I argue against this trend, and in particular I argue that making decisions in this way carries a high risk of going against the values that brought you into the crypto space in the first place.""  The comments from Buterin, widely viewed as Ethereum's intellectual leader, stand in stark contrast to the strongly pro-Trump rhetoric from other well-known crypto figures.  Ryan Selkis, the co-founder of crypto information platform Messari, has been especially vocal, calling himself a ""single issue voter"" – meaning he prefers Trump over the incumbent, Joe Biden, because Trump says he likes crypto. Selkis appeared at a recent Mar-a-Lago gala where Trump touted his NFT collection and talked about his newfound friendliness toward digital assets.  Coinbase, the large U.S.-based crypto exchange, has emerged as a major force in political donations this year, with its Fairshake PAC. The crypto industry now sports one of the biggest piles of money to sway elections – with wins already notched. At its core, this is about electing politicians who will make the U.S. an easier place for crypto businesses to operate.

""I respect Vitalik but he has always been among the most naive and useless political commentators in crypto.

31126703,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=630209,1721241040,PEPE Explosion Imminent: Analyst Predicts Price Will Rocket To $0.00004128 ATH,"The PEPE price has remained strong coming out of the crypto market crash, rebounding more than 40% in a single day. This bullishness has fed the narrative for the meme coin, which is touted to be the next big thing on Ethereum. However, the question remains whether the PEPE price will continue to rise from here if it has reached its peak for this cycle. PEPE Price Still Bullish From Here Despite being down around 30% from its May 27 all-time high of $0.00001718, the PEPE price is still showing bullish tendencies. This could point to a continuation, something that pseudonymous crypto analyst “melikatrader94” points out in an analysis on TradingView. Related Reading: Bullish Return: Institutional Investors Pour $1.44 Billion Into Crypto In One Week According to the crypto analyst, the PEPE price has bounced off an internal trend line that has been acting as support for the meme coin. As a result, there has been the formation of a double bottom following the most recent price bounce, and this is bullish for price. Since the PEPE price was quick to react to the internal trend line, the crypto analyst believes that this shows strong buying interest in the meme coin. Furthermore, the chart is showing the formation of an ascending trend line, and given the history of ascending trend lines, then price could continue to rise, as long as it doesn’t break out of this channel. With the double bottom mentioned above, the PEPE price is already seeing the result of this bullish reversal. If this continues, the price is expected to rise over 150% from here again, reaching a new all-time high of $0.00004128, according to the crypto analyst. Scenarios For Invalidation While the PEPE price is still very bullish, there are still scenarios that could send the price spiraling downward. Short of a market-wide Bitcoin and crypto crash, the PEPE price still has multiple resistance levels to conquer from here. One of those is the $0.000025 level. Furthermore, as the analyst points out, the price has to remain above the internal trend line, which currently sits just above $0.000008. As long as it holds this point, then bulls remain in charge and can try to drive the price up. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Multiple God Candles For XRP, How High Can It Go? Another major point to watch is the mid-channel resistance. In this case, the resistance lies just above $0.000025, which is above the current all-time high. This means there is still room for growth before hitting any major resistance. Last but not least is the volume for the meme coin. If the PEPE trading volume continues to rise, then the buying pressure can push the price toward new ATHs. However, a decline in the trading volume could be detrimental for the price and lead to a reversal. “Increasing trading volume would further confirm the bullish trend and provide additional confidence in reaching the target price,” the analyst said in closing.

It was exactly the sort of deflection-flex one might expect from a startup executive enjoying his liquidity moment. But as this year's U.S. presidential election lurches from one surprise to the next, Coplan's assessment appears to be right on the money. Just over the past couple weeks, blockchain bettors have used the platform (built atop the Polygon blockchain) to: wager on President Joe Biden's chances of winning reelection; gamble on Vice President Kamala Harris's odds of replacing him as the Democratic nominee; handicap Biden's performance during a press conference and ABC TV interview; bid up former President Donald Trump's likelihood of victory following an attempted assassination; and assess the appeal of his vice president pick, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio). A new breed of crypto degenerates have popped up on the social-media site X, posting their winning betting slips, with one lucky soul claiming to have netted more than $400,000 on a single punt. It should be noted that none of this Polymarket gambling is legal in the U.S., since the project was barred in 2022 from doing business in the country under a settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission that also came with a $1.4 million fine. Even so, there's some speculation that prediction markets might get increasingly cited by news outlets whose political coverage previously relied on polls or pundits. To underscore the point, Axios broke the story this week that Polymarket had hired the widely followed statistician and journalist Nate Silver as an adviser. Silver told the publication in an interview that he expected ""more of the investor class to leverage prediction markets to assess the risk of politics on their businesses."" Anyone care to bet?  SCOOP: Richard Kim, founder of crypto casino Zero Edge, who previously had served as an executive at Michael Novogratz's Galaxy as well as the Wall Street banks JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, has acknowledged losing at least $3.67 million of the company's funds on bitcoin trades that went sour as the cryptocurrency's price tumbled in June.

CarnationFM: A Decentralized Radio Playing Songs With Encrypted Hidden Messages  A mix of volunteers and hackers playing music at EthBerlin in May. (Amitoj Singh/CoinDesk)  It might just sound like music.  But a group of programmers, working on a project known as ""CarnationFM,"" have devised a means of embedding a hidden encrypted message of up to 250 kilobytes a minute into music files.  The music is broadcast through Swarm, a decentralized data storage solution operating on the Ethereum blockchain.  “Anybody can listen to the music or the song,"" said one of the collaborators, and ""anybody can download it, but only the people that hold a public key can actually see the encrypted message.""  The project, winner of the Best Social Impact award at the EthBerlin conference in May, drew inspiration from Portugal's so-called Carnation Revolution in 1974, which relied on a disc jockey's song selection to signal the start of a coup that ultimately led to the overthrow of an authoritarian government.

42417674,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZUdx,1721236708,"Without High Switching Costs, Telecom Looks Vulnerable to DeWi","As big telcos grapple with a debt burden supercharged by COVID, the prospect of at-scale 5G this decade is becoming more of a meme than an inevitability. While it’s likely a shock to customers who already see a 5G icon on their phones and assume they have full service, the 5G buildout is in its nascency.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's new DePIN Vertical, covering the emerging industry of decentralized physical infrastructure.  It will take another $250bn+ for telcos to build 5G themselves, a prospect causing little excitement in corporate boardrooms given the dearth of use cases today that require it. As a result, mobile network infrastructure providers are suffering. Ericsson shocked financial analysts this past quarter when it reported sales down almost 20% from the year before. The capital intensity, and coordination complexity of building a telecom network just isn’t worth the effort to a centralized company.  But the rate of technological progress isn’t slowing down: skyrocketing demands for cloud compute require an exponentially increasing supply of bandwidth. Where will this step function improvement come from?  Decentralized Wireless (DeWi) networks offer an efficient way of bridging the two outcomes by outsourcing the work required to build 5G networks. The secret ingredient in DeWi is community-driven collaboration: any person can deploy a device that provides others with bandwidth and be sure they will be paid for the service provision. By incentivizing people to monetize their internet connections, DeWi networks turn their communities into their supply chain.  The secret ingredient in DeWi is community-driven collaboration  Key to DeWi’s success is the commoditization of telecom hardware: while complex towers and boxes used to do the heavy lifting, now software does all the work. WiFi offload has emerged as a key component supercharging 5G, as the majority of mobile use occurs indoors.  While still nascent, this model of building telecom networks has seen promising developments. DePIN networks like Helium have created meaningful supply side footprints, supporting thousands of hotspots. By combining their footprint of hotspots with T-Mobile’s nationwide cellular network, Helium launched Helium Mobile to sell cheap phone plans directly to customers. The experiment is still early, with ~100,000 subscribers and 10,000 suppliers on the network, and many are skeptical it may ever work as free phones and two-year exclusive contracts present meaningful switching costs.  While demand has proved far slower to emerge than investors expected, the skeptical view ignores changing context that is rapidly reducing the barriers to entry.  For decades, big telecom companies have kept customers locked into long-term contracts and made it difficult to switch providers. But that's changing. The physical SIM card, once a key part of this strategy, is becoming obsolete. Apple’s new iPhone 14 supports multiple eSIMs, which are digital versions of SIM cards, meaning one can now switch carriers with a few taps on the phone instead of visiting a store.  This shift drastically reduces switching costs and levels the playing field, allowing smaller companies to compete with the telecom giants. What used to take days to switch providers now only takes minutes. This challenge has been reinforced by regulators, who aim to limit the ability of telcos to lock customers into exclusive contracts.  The last vestige of the high switching cost model, customer lock-in, is under attack by the FCC today. The FCC Chair is advocating for a policy that would stop carriers from blocking phones from using other eSIMs after six months. This change means that after six months, anybody can switch carriers easily without any restrictions, regardless of the original terms and price promotions associated with the contract.  This policy could shake up the telecom industry, ending the profitable strategy of bundling free phones with long-term contracts. As a result, the industry should expect intense price competition since carriers can no longer rely on package deals to keep customers and will have to compete on selling commoditized bandwidth.  Read more: Max Thake - DePIN: It's Time for Crypto to Get Real  The battle for per-unit bandwidth is one that DeWi has an unfair advantage in: the community deployment model adopted by protocols like Helium will always cost more than the equivalent centralized incumbent, with some scale. The three biggest cost buckets suffered by incumbent carriers are: spectrum costs, capital expenditures on hardware, and tower maintenance fees.  The secret sauce of DeWi is outsourcing all three of these costs to people willing to host internet-providing routers themselves, obviating the need to spend money on real estate and towers. By paying them in tokens, DeWi networks allow community members to participate in the upside, and incentivizes viral growth.  While companies like Helium compete on telco turf of contracted phone plans today, tomorrow they will be competing to provide on-demand bandwidth. This is a battle in which community-driven networks have an unfair advantage. Because they don’t have immense startup costs from day one, they don’t rely on long-term customer lock-in to create profit.  The same transformation in customer behavior is afoot across cloud services, as providers like AWS are being forced to move from contract software-as-a-service (SAAS) models to pay-as-you-go infrastructure-as-a-service (IAAS) models. There, too, DePIN networks are solving some of the world’s biggest problems by crowdsourcing supply. As the acceleration towards IAAS continues, expect DePIN projects like Helium to continue accruing mind share because of their flexible, cheap service offering.

42417671,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZUYn,1721235900,"Philanthropy's Blockchain Uptake Is Slow, But Future Is Bright","New research conducted at the Robert Kennedy College and University of Cumbria by Daniel Mihai sheds light on the state of blockchain in philanthropic and charitable organizations. It doesn’t make for optimistic reading, but there are some useful insights and evidence of a constructive path forward. The research is grounded on a survey conducted with 281 charitable organizations from across the globe.  From reading the outputs of the research, it’s clear that the nonprofit sector’s adoption and insights mimic very closely the adoption and performance of blockchain technology across the enterprise sector. And because enterprises don’t often shed as much light on their own internal adoption struggles and results, this study provides useful insights that match well with anecdotal feedback I receive in the market.  For those charities that are implementing blockchain technology in their operations, there were some bright spots. Nearly 70% reported they had enhanced real-time tracking of funds like donations, and spending. Around half said that blockchain adoption streamlined donations and reduced administrative costs. And nearly half the organizations using blockchain also reported that blockchain use resulted in increased frequency or amount of giving by donors because of enhanced trust in the organization and process of giving.  However, there were disappointments in the data as well. Top of the list was that less than half of all entities reported lower transaction costs. It’s possible that high fees on the Ethereum Mainnet had an impact, and not enough charities have taken advantage of the shift to lower-cost Layer 2 networks.  Read more: Pat Duffy - Why Crypto Donations Are Surging in 2024  One of the most highly touted features of blockchain technology is the ability to link sources of funding and the use of the funding itself. It’s been discussed and tested in the public sector, and charities are also examining if it can be used to help donors see a clear link between their actions and the associated positive outcomes. Early feedback, however, isn’t compelling: just 32% of the charities using blockchain saw it as useful in correlating donations with impact and outcomes.  Additionally, charities reported that the impact of recognition and reward NFTs was “marginal” at best. It seems we’re still looking for the right way to engage, retain donors, and bring them into a community and ecosystem where they feel recognized, rewarded, and engaged. These are critical metrics for charities that want to sustain their impact and they all have analogies in business ecosystems as well. Loyal, engaged, and satisfied donors or customers are the ones who keep coming back. The study’s author, Daniel Mihai, had direct experience with this as he is the founder of the Anu Initiative, a not-for-profit startup designed to connect donors with the impact generated by their contributions through the use of non-tradeable NFTs.  Over and over again, in the qualitative feedback that I discussed with Daniel, philanthropic organizations complained that blockchain tools, especially those that go beyond payments, are simply not fit for purpose and adoption was difficult to implement and sustain. This is very similar to the kinds of discussions we have with enterprise IT directors. They rarely have the budget to invest in complex new skills to add new technology.  Despite the slow progress and identified obstacles, I came away from reading the study and my discussion with Daniel feeling optimistic. To start with, the number of charitable organizations using blockchain technology is set to nearly double in the next few years: 10% of the surveyed respondents plan to implement blockchain technologies in the next one to three years. Additionally, just 4% of respondents are against the technology altogether, which is frankly a miracle given the level of fraud and corruption that came to light in the last crypto bubble.  Furthermore, the single biggest obstacle among the 72% of charities that have no plans to implement is simply due to a lack of education. For every identified benefit, such as lower costs or better transparency, 80% of the non-adopting respondents consistently had no knowledge of the value proposition and reason for implementing. That means no prejudice either for or against, just a lack of awareness.  Having served several non-profits and acted as a board member in a couple, I believe we must fix the usability problem before we go on a campaign to raise awareness. Most non-profits operate on tight budgets and depend heavily on volunteers. They don’t have large IT departments and rarely have “innovation budgets” to tap into. Adoption by non-profits is a good test of product simplicity and reliability.  The future of doing good looks pretty good from here  While enterprises are not as strapped, we must recognize that enterprise IT departments just aren’t what they used to be. Fifty years ago, companies hired software developers, and more often than not, wrote their own software. Today, nearly all enterprise IT systems are based on off-the-shelf packages and are managed by outsourcing contracts. The job in enterprise IT is integration and process control, not new development.  To drive adoption, therefore, we must replace complicated, blockchain-specific solutions with application integration models that enterprises already know how to use. This is starting to happen, as firms like PayPal, Stripe, Wise, and others, make crypto payments just another option in their standard offerings. At EY, we’re aiming for the same: standardized Application Program Interfaces (APIs) that enterprises use to plug into their own applications for supply chain integrations and procurement.  Perhaps best of all, it’s clear that a whole ecosystem of philanthropic organizations that are blockchain-centric have emerged to serve the world’s non-profits. Endaoment, The Giving Block, Gitcoin, GainForest, Charmverse and others were all cited by the study participants as having facilitated adoption and achieved good results. The future of doing good looks pretty good from here.  If you would like a copy of the detailed study results, please e-mail Daniel Mihai at daniel@anuinitiative.org.

According to Fagel, the likelihood of a settlement being discussed in this particular meeting is highly improbable, despite the community’s hopeful speculations. Ripple-SEC Settlement Is Highly Unlikely The rumor was initially fueled by Brett Hill, an ambassador for the cryptocurrency exchange Bitrue, who suggested via the social media platform X that the SEC’s private meeting might finalize the long-standing legal battle between Ripple and the regulator. Hill cited “reliable sources” and pointed to a screenshot of the SEC’s official meeting announcement, which, however, did not explicitly mention the Ripple case. Related Reading: Expert Foresees XRP Soaring To $250: Technical Analysis Explained Reacting to the speculation, Marc Fagel humorously commented on X, saying, “I mean, they’ve had about 150 of these nearly-weekly meetings since the case was filed, and Crypto Twitter was convinced a settlement was being discussed at every one of those meetings, but this is DEFINITELY the one! [Narrator: It’s not the one.]” According to the SEC’s announcement, the meeting’s agenda will cover topics such as the institution and settlement of injunctive actions, administrative proceedings, resolution of litigation claims, and other matters related to enforcement proceedings. Although the agenda does include topics that could theoretically encompass a settlement with Ripple, there is no direct evidence to suggest that this is planned for discussion. In contrast, another pro-XRP lawyer, Fred Rispoli, has outlined a potential future date, July 31, for a possible resolution, albeit noting that a “pre-judgment settlement is unlikely.” Rispoli’s prediction includes a possible penalty not exceeding $25 million for Ripple, without any disgorgement. Related Reading: XRP & Litecoin See Social Media FOMO: Bad Sign For Prices? The SEC has been engaged in a legal tussle with Ripple since December 2020. Following the summary one year and 4 days ago, both parties are currently waiting for a remedy and penalty ruling by Judge Analisa Torres. The SEC is pursuing a penalty of $102.6 million against Ripple, markedly lower than the almost $2 billion initially demanded. Ripple has suggested capping the penalty at $10 million, citing the Terraform Labs case as a precedent. Nonetheless, the SEC has dismissed this proposal in its reply brief, stating that such a minimal amount would not align with the objectives of civil penalty statutes. XRP Price Gains Momentum Over the past 12 days, the price of XRP has surged from $0.38 to over $0.61, marking a 61% increase. Although Bitcoin spearheaded the broader recovery in the cryptocurrency market, XRP has emerged as one of the top performers during this period. While no specific news can be directly linked to this price movement, the favorable technical chart setup for XRP, along with potential influence from settlement rumors, have likely contributed to the significant uptick. At press time, XRP traded at $0.61551.

Layer-2 developer StarkWare, the primary builder behind the Starknet network atop Ethereum, has offered a glimpse of what could be possible on the Bitcoin blockchain if a pending technical proposal known as OP_CAT were adopted.  Working on a Bitcoin's testing environment known as Signet, and using OP_CAT, StarkWare says it demonstrated how zero-knowledge proofs - an increasingly popular type of cryptography that's used to compress data or prove the validity of statements without offering information that may compromise privacy - could be carried out on the oldest and original blockchain.  The aim of the project was to demonstrate the capabilities of OP_CAT, a proposed Bitcoin upgrade – tipped to bring Ethereum-style ""smart contracts"" programmability, historically and famously missing from the blockchain designed by Satoshi Nakamoto as a peer-to-peer payments system.  While by no means short of supporters, OP_CAT remains in its very early stages in terms of acquiring the consensus necessary to be merged into Bitcoin' core software.

42417691,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZZ3V,1721232027,Financial Building-Blocks: Structured Products and Blockchain,"Traditionally in the domain of institutional investors, structured products combine various assets and derivatives to create tailored risk-return profiles. With the advent of blockchain, the potential for this market segment is enormous, promising significant cost reductions, enhanced composability, and improved accessibility. Currently, the global structured notes market is estimated to be worth more than $2 trillion, and blockchain stands to help widen the breadth of the market from origination to investor base.  Let’s take a look at this in more detail.  Streamlining Processes and Cost Reduction  Traditional structured products involve multiple intermediaries such as brokers, custodians, and clearinghouses, leading to operational costs ranging from 1% to 5% of the investment value annually. According to Accenture, blockchain technology can cut infrastructure costs for major investment banks by an average of 30%, translating to annual savings of $8-$12 billion.  Blockchain's cost-saving potential is particularly significant for structured products due to their complex lifecycle management. Blockchain's enhanced transparency and audit trails can help reduce these regulatory capital requirements.  Enhanced Composability to Creating Customizable Financial Solutions  Smart contracts are particularly compelling for managing complex financial products like derivatives and structured products, allowing for quick and innovative financial engineering. This modularity enables investors to craft tailored products, such as combining yield-generating DeFi protocols, tokenized assets and risk-managing derivatives like options or futures.  Improving Accessibility for Originators and Investors  Structured products have historically been accessible only to institutions. Blockchain modularity simplifies structuring and origination by eliminating intermediaries, while fractional ownership broadens investor access and reduces friction on both the supply and demand sides.  Growth of the DeFi Structured Products Market  Structured products offer advanced risk management through mechanisms like principal protection and downside barriers. Over the past year, DeFi structured products like Pendle ($6bn TVL) and Ethena ($3.6bn TVL) have grown significantly, showing strong demand for new derivatives. This trend is expected to continue, driven by maturing market infrastructure and an expanding product suite.  Tokenization Standards: Innovations like ERC-1155, ERC-404, and ERC-1400 are addressing challenges in bond identification, product tranching, and regulatory controls for structured product issuance.  DeFi Prime Brokerage: Platforms like Arkis, are introducing sophisticated margin engines for asset-specific valuations, cross-margining, and cross-chain liquidation.  Risk Management: Institutional-grade risk management systems, developed by firms like Talos (Cloudwall) and Gauntlet are crucial for facilitating the entry of institutional capital .  Decentralized Option Vaults (DOVs): DOVs are important for on-chain structured products as they provide automated yield generation, risk management, and integration with other DeFi protocols.  Oracles: Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) enhances data reliability and cross-chain functionality, and easing integration between traditional and crypto markets and cross-chains.  Crypto Options: Platforms like AEVO and Hegic provide automated on-chain options, which integrate well with algorithmic structured products.  Benchmark and Index Development: The creation of more benchmarks and indices, such as the Coindesk 20 Index (CD20) and CESR Composite Eth Staking Benchmark, provides investors reliable and powerful references to express their market views and serve as risk management tools.  Tokenization: Tokenization is foundational for bringing structured products on-chain, with TVL reaching $130-170bn (including stablecoins) in 2024 according to RWA.xyz.  One of the pervading sentiments within crypto is that the products often exhibit barbell-shaped risk-return profiles. Structured products solve this dilemma by creating a specific risk-return profile while capturing the substantial upside of this asset class. One example here is principal-protected notes mitigating depegging risk.  The path forward for on-chain structured products doesn't begin with the technology, but in developing compelling use cases to showcase their potential. As tokenization advances, integrating traditional and crypto assets in structured products will become more increasingly common, further narrowing the gap between traditional finance and crypto.

42417693,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZZ4X,1721230353,Bitcoin Summer 2024: What to Expect,"Bitcoin is currently in a lull between narratives. The excitement and speculation and fast pace of inflows from the launch of the ETFs has subsided. Not much good news is on the horizon, perhaps until the U.S. election in November. In between, it seems BTC mostly faces crypto and macro headwinds.  In June, BTC nearly reached all-time highs before higher-than-expected non-farm payroll jobs data sent prices tumbling to $58,000, despite lower inflation numbers. The start of the distribution of Mt. Gox’s $9 billion BTC and the German government's sale of seized BTC saw BTC reach as low as about $54,000, but has now rebounded to the low 60ks. Once Mt. Gox distributions are complete over the next few months, it will remove a significant price risk. Despite these negative factors, BTC has shown resilience. The next potential catalyst is the ETH ETF approval. With less liquidity than BTC, strong inflows could drive ETH higher, though a supply overhang like BTC’s might occur.  Politically, we have seen Donald Trump include positive comments about BTC and digital assets in his regular stump speech, taking an America-first stance, aiming to keep jobs and wealth here in the U.S. If Trump is re-elected, the price of BTC is likely to benefit (even though the shape of a Trump Administration’s policy on digital assets is unclear). It’s possible we may see speculative buying leading up to election day as well – a positive narrative on the horizon.  Lastly, we saw a number of major central banks cut rates in June, including Canada and the E.U. As one of the greatest correlates to BTC price is global M2 liquidity, these rate cuts suggest that the trending increase in global liquidity is moving in a beneficial direction.  At the start of June, BTC nearly hit all-time highs before tailwinds pushed it down to June range lows. Despite lower-than-expected PPI, the market showed signs of buyer fatigue. Later, Mt. Gox announced BTC distributions to creditors in July, and the German government sold seized BTC, causing prices to dip below $60,000. ETH remained more resilient but still down from its May ETF rally.  BTC currently lacks a clear narrative, with only negative events on the horizon, giving buyers little to rally around. In contrast, ETH is anticipating the go-live date for its ETFs, expected to cause market excitement due to its lower liquidity compared to BTC. Many predict the ETF S-1 approval by some time in July, which could spark interest and demand. Investors will also watch if altcoins and BTC rally alongside ETH.  On the political front, Trump continues to speak positively about BTC and crypto in his stump speeches while Biden remains largely silent on the issue. Later this month is BTC 2024 in Nashville, with several politicians attending, including Donald Trump. This venue would offer a sensible place for a candidate to announce major positions on the topic of digital assets.

31121412,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=630178,1721230217,Top Trader Exposes Worldcoin Market Manipulation Ahead Of Insider Unlocks,"The cryptocurrency Worldcoin (WLD) has seen a dramatic price increase, surging 75% over the past five days, with a significant 38% increase in the last 24 hours. According to DeFi^2 (@DefiSquared), the number one ranked trader on Bybit and a top 10 wallet on DeBank, this price movement is not merely speculative but indicative of potential market manipulation, timed with upcoming insider unlocks. The Worldcoin Cash Grab In a post shared via X, the top trader DeFi^2 has brought to light concerning details about Worldcoin’s market activities ahead of its planned insider token unlocks. With only 2.7% of WLD’s total supply currently in circulation, the smallest percentage in the industry at unlock time, the concerns center around how the Worldcoin team has managed to maintain a staggering $30 billion fully diluted valuation (FDV). “Worldcoin is projected to commence insider unlocks in 7 days at one of the lowest floats ever recorded in the industry,” DeFi^2 wrote. “This research piece brings to light exactly how the team is controlling the price to still carry a $30 billion fully diluted valuation as insider unlocks begin, while falsely claiming to have no involvement.” Related Reading: Worldcoin Sentiment Improves, But March Highs Remain A Distant Dream Worldcoin was initially launched with a 1.4% circulating supply, or 140 million WLD. Out of this, 100 million tokens were assigned to market makers with call options that allowed them to buy back a significant number of tokens at a preset price of slightly over $2. This was strategically aimed at dampening any sudden price spikes. On “The Scoop Podcast,” Alex Blania, CEO of Worldcoin, openly discussed these tactics, stating they were crucial in preventing the price from soaring, which could potentially disrupt the market. “The intent to avoid the price spiking to $10,” Blania explained, “is paramount, as such an event would be horrific for our strategic market positioning.” However, by December 16th, the situation dramatically shifted when Worldcoin opted not to renew its market maker contract. This led to the removal of the call option and a concurrent reduction in WLD’s circulation by an additional 25 million tokens. The immediate aftermath saw the price double within hours, a scenario Blania had previously indicated the company intended to avoid. During the Token2049 conference in Dubai, Blania reiterated that Worldcoin does not manipulate market prices, attributing fluctuations to natural market forces. This statement starkly contradicts the evident effects of the team’s strategic decisions regarding tokenomics and market maker contracts. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Worldcoin (WLD) Price Surged Over 15% In One Day To Reach $3 DeFi^2 emphasizes, “An 11-figure valuation is only possible due to the team’s deliberate design of tokenomics, and the daily price movements have often been influenced by well-timed announcements and policy adjustments made by the team.” Market Manipulation The Worldcoin framework, which was ostensibly designed to facilitate universal basic income (UBI), seems to be primarily benefiting insiders rather than the intended recipients. Current projections show that nearly a billion tokens are slated for emission to team members and venture capitalists within the next year, whereas only about 600 million tokens are expected to be distributed to UBI recipients in the same timeframe. “This means that within a year, insider emitted WLD is expected to make up over 60% of the entire circulating supply of Worldcoin. 60% is a wild proportion- it basically means the majority of the ecosystem purely exists for VCs to dump. This seems to directly counter the justification that the float is being left low right now to benefit UBI recipients,” the trader writes. Orb Operators, tasked with collecting biometric data, have also been a significant source of circulating supply, with some reportedly sending upwards of 20,000 WLD per week to exchanges like Binance. This situation became particularly pronounced when WLD’s price spiked to $12 in March, with substantial quantities of WLD being moved to exchanges every few days. Retail investors, particularly in Korea, where 25% of the circulating supply is held, are increasingly vulnerable. Many of these investors are likely unaware of the intricate dynamics at play, holding tokens at nearly $30 billion FDV, a valuation propped up by the positive news released strategically a week before the unlocks. “It’s likely no coincidence that Worldcoin waited until 1 week before unlocks to release positive news. Despite being only a small change to unlock selling pressure, the news has proven incredibly effective so far in coercing retail to unwittingly provide higher prices and more liquidity for insiders to exit in a week’s time. Worse still, it appears likely (but not proven) that someone from the team or VCs used insider information to frontrun buying the news before it was even publicly announced,” @DefiSquared claims. He concludes with a stern warning: “This piece is intended to shed light on a project that appears to be intentionally propping up a token price that should be lower, and many of the reasons outlined are why I intend to be short WLD over the months following the start of unlocks.” At press time, WLD traded at $3.22.

Core is a future leader in high-performance computing hosting, the report said.  The bitcoin miner has started on the path to achieving economies of scope with its CoreWeave deal, the broker said.  Core Scientific (CORZ) is a future leader in hosting high-performance computing (HPC) due to the lucrative deals it has inked with CoreWeave and management’s solid experience in operating enterprise data centers, broker B Riley said in a research report on Tuesday.  The broker upgraded the Dover, Delaware-based company to buy from neutral and raised its price target on the shares to $13 from $0.50. The shares were trading 1.5% lower at $11.53 at publication time.  B Riley said it was updating its estimates for Core Scientific to reflect the CoreWeave deal and potential future HPC agreements. It said it valued the already announced agreements, excluding the Austin contract, at $2.3 billion in total for the committed 270 megawatts (MW). This does not include possible extension options for both contracts.  “With 1.23 million bitcoin {{BTC}} left to be mined (~6% of total issuance), the size of the industry, excluding transaction fees, is around $80 billion at today’s BTC prices,” analysts Lucas Pipes and Nick Giles wrote, adding that “we have maintained a long-term thesis that economies of scope will become increasingly important for digital miners.”  Core has started on the path to achieving economies of scope with this AI deal, and has exceeded expectations with the structure it agreed because CoreWeave will fund all capital costs arising from HPC upgrades, the report said.

42417687,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZZ0P,1721226113,"Democrats Have Made a 'Horrific Mistake' on Crypto, Says SkyBridge Capital’s Anthony Scaramucci","Democrats' failure to introduce crypto legislation is damaging the party's prospects in the coming presidential election, Scaramucci said.  Although he supports Trump's stance on crypto, Scaramucci won't be voting for the former president in November.  Anthony Scaramucci, Donald Trump’s former director of communications, might just turn out to be his most vocal critic.  The Skybridge Capital founder and CEO, who held his position under the former president in 2017 for less than a week, will not be voting for the Republican presidential nominee this November, even though they agree on at least one political issue: the need to enact clear crypto legislation.  The Democrats' failure to do so is damaging them, said Scaramucci, who nevertheless continues to support the party.  “The Democrats have made a horrific mistake,” he said in an interview with CoinDesk’s Jennifer Sanasie. “They could have been neutral on crypto or positive on crypto. And I think it would have helped them in the election.”  Scaramucci is also no fan of Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler, even though he “weirdly helped the industry” by delaying his decision to allow the launch of spot bitcoin {{BTC}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs) until crypto rediscovered its footing after a tumultuous year.  ""I want Gary Gensler to be fired,"" he said, arguing that the antipathy of Gensler and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has been an ""unbelievable disaster"" for the crypto industry.  Regarding Trump, he says the former president is not just all talk when it comes to crypto.  If Trump gets reelected in November – which traders on crypto-based prediction market platform Polymarket are signaling has a 70% probability – Scaramucci said the new administration will create a supportive environment for the crypto industry.  “They'll put a pro-SEC, pro-crypto, pro-digital asset SEC commissioner in place,” he said. “This whole discussion about what is a security and what's a token and all this stuff will go by the wayside.”  Trump emerged as the “pro-crypto presidential candidate” earlier this year when he reiterated his view that central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) would be a danger to freedom, and he would not allow the creation of such a product.  He started accepting donations in crypto and said he would “build a crypto army” to fight the “anti-crypto army,” referring to Warren.  On Monday, he announced that he had picked Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) for vice president, who is also considered crypto-friendly.

31118730,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=630207,1721224835,XRP Whales Are On The Move Again – Here’s What They’re Doing This Time,"XRP whales are on the move amidst a new surge in the wider market as the altcoin is currently grinding better than most would expect. The cryptocurrency has been on a roll in the past 24 hours, which has enabled it to outperform other large market-cap cryptocurrencies in both the 24-hour and seven-day time frames. It is interesting to note that this surge in the ultra-bullish XRP narrative can be partly linked to an increase in whale activity. According to both on-chain and exchange data, large wallets have increased their accumulation of XRP tokens. XRP Whales On The Move The XRP ecosystem is home to various whales besides Ripple whose actions may also signal the ongoing sentiment for the cryptocurrency. Various on-chain data has shown large XRP transactions in the past few weeks to and from exchanges. Whatever the reasons, massive transactions are worth paying attention to as they can either increase or decrease buying and selling pressure. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Telegram-Based Notcoin Is Ready To Fly, Here’s How High Notably, large transactions have increased in the past 24 hours, suggesting some whales might be accumulating XRP tokens. According to data from Whale Alerts, a crypto whale tracking service, 23.2 million XRP worth $13.58 million was recently transferred from Binance to a private wallet. 🚨 23,216,582 #XRP (13,587,688 USD) transferred from #Binance to unknown wallethttps://t.co/hw9Tr12AN9 — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) July 16, 2024 Shortly after, there was another transfer of 25.2 million XRP worth $14.9 million from Binance to another unknown wallet. 🚨 25,247,582 #XRP (14,907,202 USD) transferred from #Binance to unknown wallethttps://t.co/a5HaenCO7a — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) July 16, 2024 Data from the on-chain analytics platform Santiment also supports this whale accumulation narrative. A metric that follows the balances of wallets holding between 100,000 and 1 million XRP has significantly increased since last week. The number of addresses in this cohort currently stands at 30,722, which is an increase of 122 addresses from 30,600 addresses recorded at the beginning of July. Similarly, the large holder metric shows that five new addresses have joined the number of addresses holding between 10 million XRP and 100 million XRP tokens since July 13. There are currently 262 addresses in this cohort. Although the increase is relatively small compared to the total number of holders, their importance cannot be overstated. Their substantial control over the token supply makes them key players in the price of the altcoin. Related Reading: Analyst Says Solana Price Could Rise 450% To $840 – Here Are The Drivers As noted on social media platform X by Santiment, this increase in accumulation has pushed the total number of XRP tokens held by addresses holding over 100,000 coins to 51.29 billion, its current all-time high. 🐳📈 XRP has now climbed above $0.58 for the first time since the market-wide retrace back on April 12th. This rebound is supported by climbing levels of coin hodling from whales and sharks with 100K+ XRP coins. A noticable turning point in supply accumulation began last August. pic.twitter.com/nBNsAfnoiw — Santiment (@santimentfeed) July 16, 2024 At the time of writing, the altcoin is trading at $0.6136 and has been up 13% and 34% in the past 24 hours and seven days, respectively. Interest in XR has now reached its highest level in four months. The altcoin is now at a critical price as this surge in interest could cause the price of XRP to continue climbing and easily break above resistance at $0.613.

Ethereum is trying to improve scalability using layer 2 networks, but this is a long term initiative. Softer inflation data suggests a loosening of monetary policy is imminent, which should be supportive of Ethereum in the near term. Longer term, competition and uncertainty regarding how value will accrue within the Ethereum ecosystem may limit the upside. Ether ( ETH-USD ) has performed relatively poorly during the current cycle. While there are valid questions around Ethereum's functionality and adoption in real-world use cases, I think that some of Ether's struggles are simply the result of tighter monetary policy. Declining inflation could lead to lower interest rates later in 2024 though, which may support Ether's price. Inflows into Ethereum ETFs could also provide a boost, although I believe that the fragmentation of demand across competing chains will remain a headwind in the near term. Supply Ethereum became modestly deflationary in 2022 with the switch to proof of stake. This move was widely expected to drive Ether's price higher, although I tend to think the importance of supply changes is generally overstated, particularly when viewed in isolation. Ethereum is now returning to an inflationary supply to help try and reduce transaction fees, with the Dencun upgrade in March 2024. Inflation is modest, though, and I don't believe this will be an important determinant of Ether's price going forward. Figure 1: Ethereum Supply Inflation (source: Created by author using data from Yahoo Finance and Etherscan) Demand The number of Ethereum active addresses suggests that demand has increased along with price in recent months, although this has been fairly modest. Unlike 2020, price has led demand rather than the other way around, which I think is somewhat concerning. While DeFi and NTFs created hype in 2021, a similar growth driver hasn't really emerged in the current cycle. This is an area where scalability is hurting Ethereum. Low cost and fast transactions have been driving DeFi and NFT adoption on Solana. Solana has also seen a surge in meme coin activity. Figure 2: Ethereum Active Addresses (source: Created by author using data from Yahoo Finance and Etherscan) AI Artificial intelligence and autonomous agents could be an emerging tailwind for Ethereum. This is because generative AI and agents threaten to create a world where: The majority of content is created by AI Publicly available information is used to train models without attribution or compensation Internet users are unable to determine whether content is real or fake The activity of many agents needs to be coordinated Crypto can help to alleviate some of these issues by: Transparently proving ownership Providing a source of identity Providing economic incentives which coordinate the activity of agents and help allocate resources It is too early to say how large the impact of AI will be or how these types of issues will be managed, though. For example, ownership, identity and activity coordination could also be provided by a centralized service. Ethereum ETF Ethereum's recent ETF approval could be considered a tailwind based on Bitcoin's experience. The launch of Bitcoin ETFs has probably opened up demand somewhat, with ETF flows an important driver of price at the moment. ETF inflows have fallen off in recent weeks, but Bitcoin's price appears to have led this move. Figure 3: Bitcoin ETF Flows (source: Created by author using data from Yahoo Finance) Spot Ethereum ETFs are expected to begin trading in the coming days/weeks. While there are likely to be inflows that are supportive of Ether's price, outflows from Grayscale's Ethereum Trust could weigh on the price initially. A similar dynamic occurred with Bitcoin, where there was 6.5 billion USD of outflows from Grayscale in the first month. The fact that Ethereum ETFs will not offer staking rewards to investors may also limit their appeal. Relative Performance Ethereum's performance has been relatively poor in recent months/years in comparison to some cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin and Solana. While some of this can likely be attributed to sentiment and financial conditions, Ethereum is also facing competition from within its own ecosystem as well as competition with other blockchains. This is less about competition from any particular chain, as I don't think there is a real competitor to Ethereum at this point in time. Rather, Ethereum is competing against many chains, some of which have managed to craft compelling narratives at various points in time (Solana, Avalanche, Binance). With the approval of Ethereum ETFs, it has been suggested that other cryptocurrencies could follow, in particular Solana. Solana is still at risk of being classified a security though, and currently lacks a futures-based ETF in the US. Figure 4: SOL/ETH Ratio (source: Created by author using data from Yahoo Finance) Financial Conditions I think that monetary policy could be part of the reason for Ethereum's relatively poor performance in the current cycle. Interest rates remain elevated, and the Federal Reserve continues to drain liquidity from the system. This has had a dramatic impact on some assets and equities, although many assets and equities remain unaffected. Ethereum's underperformance relative to Bitcoin appears to have been correlated with the reduction in the Federal Reserve's balance sheet over the past few years. Figure 5: Central Bank Liquidity and Performance of Ethereum Relative to Bitcoin (source: Created by author using data from Yahoo Finance) Ethereum is a risk-on asset and generally trades in line with other risk-on assets, like the Nasdaq index. The Nasdaq 100 index has significantly outperformed Ethereum in recent months, though. I think some of this is due to interest rates and quantitative tightening. AI has also been largely responsible for the strong performance of large cap tech stocks. Figure 6: Nasdaq 100 and Ethereum Performance (source: Created by author using data from Yahoo Finance) Ethereum Fundamentals Aside from external forces, there also needs to be consideration of the fact that technical progress has been slow, and that real-world adoption is still limited. Ethereum is prioritizing decentralization, and as a result, scalability remains a problem. Proposals for improving throughput include sharding and moving transaction volumes to layer 2 networks. Sharding involves splitting up block producers so that each producer doesn't have to process every transaction. Layer 2 networks, including sidechains and rollups, sit on top of Ethereum and are designed to provide faster and cheaper execution. They do this by bundling a group of transactions together and sending them to Ethereum as a single piece of data. Rollups execute transactions but do not need a consensus to verify them and are considered the best option for execution. Optimistic Rollups assume all data is valid and use fraud proofs to ensure transaction correctness, whereas zk-Rollups use zero-knowledge proofs for enhanced privacy and security. Rather than trying to implement sharding, Ethereum is now pursuing danksharding. In danksharding, bundles of layer 2 rollup transactions are processed together without permanently storing all their data. The Dencun Upgrade was recently implemented, introducing proto-danksharding. Proto-danksharding reduces the amount of data permanently stored on chain. Separate ""data availability"" layers could also help with scalability by reducing the number of times data needs to be downloaded from the main network. Ethereum's roadmap includes a number of changes that promise to improve performance, including: Single-Slot Finality - blocks are proposed and finalized in the same slot. Verkle Trees - combine ""Vector commitment"" and ""Merkle Trees"", enabling stateless clients. This is important as stateless clients only require a small amount of storage space to verify new blocks. Account Abstraction - Enables smart contracts to initiate transactions. This will support new features, like batch transactions and the ability to recover lost account keys. These changes will likely take years to implement though and are unlikely to be drivers of price in the near term. Innovations that improve scalability and the user experience could help to drive adoption. I question whether technology is the only thing preventing broader adoption of cryptocurrencies, though. Conclusion Ethereum's performance during the current bull market has been relatively poor. While this could be the result of competition or uncertainty about the cryptocurrency's roadmap, I believe much of it has been due to monetary policy. Ethereum is a high beta, risk-on asset, and as such has been negatively impacted by high interest rates and quantitative tightening. With recent inflation data pointing towards a potential easing of monetary policy, there is a chance Ethereum's performance strengthens going forward. This is also supported by imminent ETF inflows and a reduced probability of Ethereum being classified as a security . Ethereum lacks Bitcoin's digital gold narrative, though, and as such is more dependent on demonstrating real world usage. While lower fees are supportive of usage and transaction volumes, Ethereum is generally limited by throughput but is trying to deal with this through the use of layer 2 networks. Even if Ethereum becomes widely adopted, facilitating a large amount of economic activity, the current roadmap muddies valuation. Presumably most of the value will accrue to the base layer, as I have written before , but this is speculative. As such, I don't expect Ethereum's value to continue rising rapidly longer term, even if near-term factors are supportive.",POSITIVE,ETH | SOL,BTC | ETH | FIAT | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4704551-ethereum-a-more-favorable-backdrop-is-emerging?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/31118011.jpeg

Given the volume data from the March sell-off, the illiquidity of the fund foretells price declines in 2025 even if Solana's price increases. Shares outstanding have doubled year to date. Lockups for these new private placements will start expiring in Q1-24. When I last covered the Grayscale Solana Trust ( GSOL ) for Seeking Alpha, GSOL traded at an 800% premium to the net asset value of the fund's shares. This update is not going to be a re-write of that same piece from early-March. Rather, we'll look at the more updated NAV rate, private placement data, and the fundamental setup for Solana as a blockchain network. First, this excerpt from my March article is probably one of the most important things to understand for those who have not yet seen the prior work: This particular fund is designed for the sole purpose of offering investors exposure to the native asset of the Solana ( SOL-USD ) blockchain, SOL. That's it. There is no other asset or business underlying GSOL but SOL. Thus, the valuation of the GSOL shares relative to the SOL that each share represents is arguably the most important factor in determining if GSOL shares are a buy or a sell. Since the time that was published, shares of GSOL have battled back to nearly $500 per share once again, after initially collapsing by nearly 70% in the immediate sessions following my post. Data by YCharts There are a couple of things that I find telling about this price action. First, GSOL has underperformed the underlying asset since mid-March. Second, the initial collapse in the price of GSOL is an important cautionary tale about illiquidity. GSOL Daily Chart (TrendSpider) The two sessions following my March GSOL article resulted in 3x and 4x average daily volume - the price of the fund fell by 69% from peak to trough over those two sessions. The lesson here is when there are more motivated sellers than motivated buyers, price discovery will generally result in a rerating lower, as we saw four months ago. Since then, daily volume hasn't sniffed the highs of those March 11th and March 12th sessions, and the resulting impact has been a grind higher on low volume. But as we'll explore in a moment, there will come a time when volume spikes again. Current NAV Rate As of article submission, GSOL's NAV rate is once again grinding up near the 800% premium it traded at in early March. Each fund share is currently backed by 0.374 SOL. At a $162 SOL price, GSOL's underlying value is $58.23 per share, yet the shares command a market value of roughly $500 as of 7/15/24 close: Data by YCharts What's interesting to me about GSOL's NAV rate is the premium is far more similar to what has typically been observed in the very small Grayscale funds. At $74 million in AUM, GSOL is among Grayscale's top 5 single asset closed end funds by AU, yet the fund trades more like one of the smaller cap Grayscale funds based on the premium rates: AUM Rank Grayscale Fund AUM (millions) Share NAV Market Value Premium 1 Ethereum $9,964 $32.13 $31.97 -0.50% 2 Ethereum Classic $265 $18.99 $12.63 -33.49% 3 Bitcoin Cash $135 $3.34 $11.70 250.30% 4 Litecoin $129 $6.12 $21.09 244.61% 5 Solana $74 $58.23 $499.86 758.42% Source: Grayscale, as of 7/15/24 close At 800%, GSOL's premium is more similar to the 500% premium of a fund like the Grayscale Decentraland Trust ( MANA ) than that of a fund like the Grayscale Litecoin Fund ( LTCN ) despite having an AUM figure far closer to LTCN. Low Float & Shares Growth In Grayscale's Q1-24 report for GSOL, the company disclosed a 65% year to date increase in shares outstanding from 633k to 1,048k: Q1-24 Quarterly Report (Grayscale) While only 23,640 of these shares were held by related parties at the end of March, the float of 288k shares implies a quarter over quarter reduction in the float as a percentage of shares outstanding from 31% to 27%. We don't yet have a quarterly report for Q2-24, but we do know from Grayscale's website that GSOL currently has 1,272,927 shares outstanding as of July 15th 2024. This means that shares outstanding have actually doubled so far in 2024. The increase in shares outstanding is a product of the Grayscale reopening of private placements earlier this year. According to Grayscale's private placement tab on the GSOL page, private placements require a 12-month lockup: Following a one-year holding period, Grayscale intends to attempt to have Shares of new products quoted on a secondary market. However there is no guarantee that we will be successful. When these shares come out of lockup, they can be sold at the market rate, even though the placements are made at NAV. Essentially, accredited investors can buy GSOL shares at $58 and wait a year to sell on secondary at a premium. The catch is, the premium can swing wildly and the last investors in via private placement are taking on more duration risk while they wait in line as earlier peers sell out to capture the premium - potentially reducing that premium dramatically if there aren't enough willing buyers. And I'll reiterate, if just a 3x spike in average volume over two sessions can whack the secondary price down 69% as it did back in March 2025 will likely lead to a dramatic reduction in the market price of GSOL given the shares outstanding have doubled just halfway through 2023. Longing Solana Is The Better Play The question for accredited investors would be is private placement worth the duration risk? The answer to that likely boils down to whether one is bullish of Solana longer term. As long as the price of SOL doesn't fall below private placement price, private placers can potentially still get out ahead on their initial investments, provided the fund doesn't flip to a NAV rate discount as virtually every Grayscale fund did back in 2021. Fundamentally, I still really like the setup for Solana: Solana P/F vs MC (Token Terminal) I'm personally of the view the Solana's key metrics are actually very good. Despite the price of the coin surging more than 600% from the lows of crypto winter, the valuation of Solana has actually come down considerably. At 122x circulating fees, Solana is trading at a fraction of the valuation that Ethereum has been trading at for the last several months. Stablecoin footprint (Defi Llama) Furthermore, Solana's stablecoin footprint continues to improve relative to smart contract blockchain peers. Solana once again finds itself in the top 5 for stablecoin market caps at $3.3 billion. While it certainly hasn't manifested yet to a large degree, growth in stablecoins on low-fee chains like Solana is indicative of a growing ability for merchants and consumers to utilize public blockchains for dollar-based settlement without the need for higher fee processing peers like Stripe or Square. Closing Thoughts I'm admittedly surprised the GSOL premium is still as high as it is here in mid-July. For GSOL holders, I would remain mindful of growth in shares outstanding through the end of the year. The lockup periods for 2024 private placers will begin in the first quarter of 2025. For accredited investors considering a private placement, I would weigh the merits of simply buying Solana and staking for the 7% reward. This way the duration risk of the lockup period is eliminated, there is no risk of selling your shares below NAV on secondary, and you're not paying Grayscale's 2.5% management fee while the SOL sits dormant for 12 months.",NEGATIVE,SOL,BCH | BUSINESS | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4704540-gsol-fade-the-trust-long-solana?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/31116587.jpeg

Analyst Bullish On Injective After 25% Surge,"The price of Injective has increased by over 25% in the past week, from a low of $17 to $23.27 this morning. Recently, the cryptocurrency market has been trending positively, and the substantial increase in Bitcoin’s price is a significant factor in this price ascent. The upbeat perception of Bitcoin has been a significant factor in the success of altcoins. Injective is one of the most significant beneficiaries. Related Reading: Expert Foresees XRP Soaring To $250: Technical Analysis Explained A decent rise in trading volume has coincided with INJ’s price spike, suggesting increasing investor interest. With $512 million in 24-hour trading volume and a $2.17 billion market capitalisation, it is evident that injective is becoming more and more popular in the market. Expert Eyes $50 Goal The renowned cryptocurrency specialist, World of Charts, has expressed a favourable evaluation of Injective’s probable price trajectory. According to his research, INJ is now seeing an upward trend and is consolidating within a bullish continuation signal, namely a falling wedge formation. With its lower highs and lower lows, the falling wedge pattern implies that a breakout may be on the horizon. $Inj#Inj Is In Strong Uptrend Currently Consolidating Within Falling Wedge (Bullish Pattern) Injective Needs To Clear This Wedge To Continue Its Upside Move Incase Of Successful Breakout Expecting Move Towards 50$ In Coming Weeks#Crypto #Injective pic.twitter.com/oTkRdHdNes — World Of Charts (@WorldOfCharts1) July 15, 2024 World of Charts highlighted that Injective must effectively break out of its wedge pattern in order to resume its upward trajectory. A breakthrough would indicate that the consolidation phase is over and the rising trend is back on track. The expert anticipates that if this breakout happens, the price of INJ would rise over the next few weeks and approach $50. Ethereum ETFs: Will They Change The Injective Market? The market is getting even more excited because Ethereum ETFs will be available starting July 23. People think that this important event will give the market new hope, which will bring in new buyers and make more people want to buy cryptocurrency. As expected, the release of Ethereum ETFs will cause the price of Injective to go through the roof. People who follow the market are very positive about how Ethereum ETFs might affect it. The expected influx of big investors and the ease of access to Ethereum-related assets may cause the values of altcoins to rise. INJ Price Prediction: A Positive Sight By August 16, 2024, Injective is seen rising by 220% to $83.77. As we speak, th coin has a 69 score on the Fear & Greed Index. Having a price range of 6.60%, injective has had 15 out of 30 “green days” during the past 30 days. These factors indicate that the altcoin could see significant increase in the next months. Due to the fact that the cryptocurrency industry is still expanding, Injective is in a favourable position to profit from the current bullishness as well as the market triggers that are going to occur in the near future.

The next step is to prepare a bill for the Legislative Council.  Hong Kong's financial regulators said they plan to present a bill on fiat-referenced stablecoins to the Legislative Council later this year.  The Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) published the results of a consultation, and concluded that the stablecoin regime would ""primarily focus on representations of value which rest on ledgers that are operated in a decentralised manner"" in which ""no person has the unilateral authority to control or materially alter its functionality or operation.""  The consultation paper for stablecoin guidelines published at the end of last year received 108 submissions from stakeholders. The regulators plan to take suggestions from respondents before finalizing the bill for the legislative process.  The regulators confirmed their initial proposal that any person who issues a stablecoin in Hong Kong must obtain a license. While they say keeping reserve assets with banks licensed in Hong Kong could provide greater user protection, they are open to considering proposals on placing reserve assets in other jurisdictions.  Foreign entities intending to apply for a license will be required to establish a Hong Kong subsidiary and have key management personnel, including a CEO, in the territory.  After considering the responses, the HKMA said it is ""inclined to reduce the frequency of public disclosure."" It had proposed monthly attestation by an independent auditor, and will continue discussions on the matter.  Hong Kong is trying to keep pace with other major jurisdictions in becoming a leading crypto hub. Europe's MiCA stablecoin regime came into force this month and members of Congress in the U.S. are actively attempting to push forward stablecoin bills.  In March, the HKMA started a regulatory sandbox to give potential stablecoin issuers immunity in testing certain operations. In today's announcement, the HKMA said it is processing the applications for the stablecoin issuer sandbox and will announce more shortly.

42417700,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZZ9h,1721217666,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Bulls Eye $70K After Return to $66K,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin traders are eyeing a short-term price target of $70,000 as BTC briefly climbed above $66,000 during the Asian day. Bitcoin subsequently retreated to $65,000 during the European morning, still 2.2% higher than 24 hours ago. “The rebound in Bitcoin price shows the market has a more optimistic outlook in the near-term macro environment,” shared Lucy Hu, senior analyst at Metalpha, in a message to CoinDesk. “The market was encouraged by Donald Trump’s vice president pick, which indicates a more crypto-friendly administration and policies.” Bitcoin may also be benefiting from more bullish sentiment as traders expect less selling pressure in the long term as Mt. Gox repayments to creditors have commenced.  Bitcoin ETFs extended their seven-day winning run on Tuesday, recording $422.5 million of inflows, the biggest single-day tally since June 5. The lion's share was enjoyed by BlackRock's IBIT, which amassed over $260 million. The ETFs have collectively drawn in over $1 billion in just the last three days, underscoring the upward swing in confidence in bitcoin's price prospects. The ETFs' seven-day inflow streak coincides with a surge of around 20% in BTC. Along with Donald Trump's improved presidential prospects, it's likely that the supply overhang from sales by German state Saxony is behind us and the crypto market is catching up with the sustained rally in technology stocks on Wall Street.  XRP has jumped over 12% in the last 24 hours, comfortably outperforming its fellow crypto majors. The broader crypto market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index, has risen around 4.2%. XRP's seven-day gains have grown to about 40%, snapping a long run of performing worse than the rest of the digital asset market. ""The reversal of sentiment in crypto has sparked a rise on steroids in the once-largest altcoin,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro senior market analyst, said. Gains in the token started last week as CME and CF Benchmarks announced the debut of indices and reference rates for XRP. The moves have formed a triangle pattern on long-term price charts, which some popular traders say could favor bullish action in the coming weeks.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows daily movements in the ratio between ether and bitcoin's dollar-denominated prices since October 2023.  The ratio is witnessing a volatility squeeze represented by the triangular consolidation ahead of the expected spot ether ETF debut in the U.S. next week.  A potential breakout would mean ether outperformance in the near term.

42417702,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZZAj,1721215157,"Rotation Out of Mega-Cap U.S. Stocks Could Provide Tailwind for Cryptocurrencies, Marex Solutions Says","Wall Street investors are piling into small-cap stocks and exiting mega-caps on signs of cooling inflation and strengthening Fed rate-cut bets.  The sector rotation could potentially lead to more capital deployment in the crypto market, according to Marex Solutions' Ilan Solot  Wall Street's pivot to shares in small-cap companies at the expense of mega caps could fuel gains in the crypto market, Marex Solutions told CoinDesk Wednesday.  Since July 8, Nasdaq, Wall Street's tech-heavy index of 100 shares, including the so-called magnificent seven (Mag 7) of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, has traded little changed around 2,270 points. Meanwhile, the Russell 2000, a small-cap index, has surged more than 12%, according to the charting platform TradingView.  It's a sign investors are pulling money out of the largest tech firms and dumping it into smaller companies which, until recently, lagged behind the broader market. The Wall Street Journal attributes the newfound love for small caps to cooling inflation and strengthening confidence that the Federal Reserve will reduce the benchmark borrowing cost this year.  The sector rotation could be the most important macroeconomic factor for cryptocurrencies, according to Ilan Solot, senior global strategist at Marex Solutions, a division of global financial platform Marex specializing in creating and distributing customized derivatives products.  ""As the steam comes off the Mag 7, money will look for other places to deploy. Small caps are the knee-jerk reaction, but I suspect crypto will benefit from this rotation,"" Solot said in an interview.  Solot's perspective contrasts with the crypto market's widely held perception that trends in Nasdaq alone determine the valuations of digital assets.  Institutions and traditional investors could have already started allocating money to crypto, as evidenced by the renewed demand for the U.S.-listed spot bitcoin {{BTC}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The 11 funds recorded a cumulative net inflow of $422.5 million on Tuesday, the highest tally in six weeks. The total inflow for the past three days has been over $1 billion.  According to Solot, the sector rotation may be particularly favorable for Ethereum's native token, ether {{ETH}}, and the impending debut of spot ETH ETFs.

31112225,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=630185,1721214037,BNB Price Rally Imminent? Trendline Break Could Ignite Surge To $635,"Currently, the price of BNB has been attempting a bullish momentum movement toward the bullish trendline. This bullish move which is the second attempt the crypto asset is making after a successful break below the trendline is sparking up optimism among traders and investors alike that a break above could ignite a potential rally toward the $635 resistance mark. As BNB’s bullish sentiment continues to build, this article aims to analyze its current price actions and technical indicators pointing toward sustained growth to provide readers with adequate insight into BNB’s potential future actions. BNB’s price is currently trading at around $580, up by 4.15% with a market capitalization of over $85 billion and a trading volume of over $1 9 billion as of the time of writing. In the last 24 hours, there has been a 24-hour increase of %3.82 in BNB’s market capitalization and a 7.89% decrease in its trading volume. Technical Analysis: Key Trendline And A Potential Rally In Focus Currently, the price of BNB on the 4-hour chart is trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), attempting an upward move toward the bullish trendline. It can also be observed here that the price of the crypto asset has previously attempted a move on the bullish trendline but enchanters a pullback, which has risen again for a retest. The 4-hour Composite Trend Oscillator also suggests that the crypto asset may potentially sustain its positive sentiment toward the bullish trendline and aim for the $635 resistance level as the signal line and the SMA of the indicator are still trending in the overbought zone and no cross-over attempt has been made. On the 1-day chart, the price of BNB is bullish and is attempting a move towards the 100-day SMA and the bullish trendline. Although the crypto asset is still trading below the 100-day SMA, with the momentum the price is building, it could potentially break above the trendline and continue to rise toward the $635 resistance level. Finally, it can observed that the signal line has crossed above the SMA of the indicator and are both attempting a move out of the oversold zone. With this formation, it can be suggested that BNB may experience more price growth. Future Outlook: What Lies Beyond For BNB? BNB is currently attempting a bullish move toward the bullish trendline. If the crypto asset breaks below the bullish trendline, it may start a rally toward the $635 resistance level. A break above this level may trigger a more bullish move for BNB to test the $724 resistance level and other lower levels. However, if the price of BNB fails to break above the bullish trendline and begins to drop again, it will start to move toward the $500 support level. It could potentially undergo a further drop toward the $357 support level and other lower levels if there is a breach below the $500 support point.

42417698,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZZ5Z,1721213472,"Crypto Exchanges Clamping Down on Prime Brokers Is Backwards Step for Market Efficiency, Traders Say","First Binance then OKX have clamped down on prime brokers who offer their clients lower fees.  Some trading firms claim this is a step towards less efficient markets and a result of large exchanges looking to boost their volumes.  As the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges crack down on brokerage firms that have bundled together clients to take advantage of lower trading fees, some market participants are warning the move could harm markets.  Binance was the first to prevent prime brokers from leveraging its multitiered fee system to lower their own costs and offer rebates to clients, making changes to its Link Plus interface last month. Now, OKX appears to be following suit and clamping down on access to its VIP fee program.  The exchanges say they are taking these steps to foster a level playing field for their users while ensuring they have transparency into the identity of the prime brokers' customers. Others see it as a backward step, at least from the perspective of creating more efficient markets.  Cryptocurrency markets were built for retail customers, first and foremost, and that’s why they differ so dramatically from traditional finance. In mature markets, prime brokers offer institutions the equivalent of a simple bank account, behind which an army of intermediaries safely stores cash and assets and facilitates trades at lightning speed across a range of venues. Prime brokers also provide credit, allowing traders to shuffle and change positions, with everything netted down and settled a day or two later.  Crypto’s capacity to disintermediate and deliver real-time settlement by blockchain means large participants with multiple simultaneous trades have to fund all their positions up front across a group of large, vertically integrated exchanges. Prime brokers solve that funding problem through their lending and financing component, points out George Zarya, the CEO of Bequant, a prime brokerage firm that services crypto clients.  By cutting the brokerages' access to lower fees, the exchanges may – possibly inadvertently, possibly not – be making the crypto market less attractive for them.  “Exchanges have decided that intermediaries are not necessary. They can provide loans as well, right?” said Zarya in an interview. “But they can only provide loans for the positions that are based on their exchange. They cannot provide portfolio margin, which includes your positions across the entire market. So essentially we're moving towards less capital-efficient markets.”  Large crypto exchanges are leaning towards “liquidity capture,” said Brendan Callan, CEO of Tradu, a recently launched crypto exchange owned by investment banking group Jeffries. In other words, they are creating a captive audience model, where trading volume is increased because a user has to continually get in and out of positions on that exchange.  The result is a discrepancy in bid prices on very popular and liquid pairs like BTC/USDT from one exchange to the next, Callan said. The inter-exchange discrepancies would appear “bonkers” to a conventional currency trader, he said, because liquidity providers all clear to a prime brokerage account behind the scenes so they can make markets on any other exchange.  “It means you don't have this friction of counterparty risk thresholds across all of these exchanges. But the crypto exchanges themselves are insisting on this because they want that capture,” Callan said in an interview. “They want you to have to get in and out of positions on their exchange, because it boosts their volume, but it's at a cost to the quality of their liquidity. There's not as much depth in the market behind each quote and it's very sporadic.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/07/17/crypto-exchanges-clamping-down-on-prime-brokers-is-backwards-step-for-market-efficiency-traders-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8ed7eb37f74c7af50076d90f9d4766985dd1f4a1-3684x2072.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42417681,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZYtB,1721209914,Market Maker Flowdesk Doubled Down on the U.S. as Things Looked Bleak. Now That Bet Is Paying Off,"A year ago, market maker Flowdesk made a contrarian bet by expanding its U.S. presence during the chill of crypto winter.  That bet paid off, as winter became spring then summer, and a favorable market environment and improving regulations means Flowdesk is well positioned in the country.  Guilhem Chaumont, CEO of market maker Flowdesk, is prepared to follow his convictions even when the general outlook might indicate against them.  Back in 2023, days before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began a second all-out assault on the crypto industry, suing Binance and a number of protocols, Chaumont said he planned to expand the Paris-based market maker's New York office.The size and sophistication of the U.S. capital markets were a worthwhile trade-off for dealing with its regulatory regime, he said.  At the time, it was a contrarian move. A few months earlier, CoinDesk ran a rare editorial piece, observing that conspiracy theories that the U.S. government was trying to kill crypto didn't seem too far off. The editorial argued that the government was intentionally suppressing the industry through punitive regulatory enforcement actions and a lack of willingness to build workable rules.  ""The philosophy of the company has always been the same. We have a huge conviction about where the market is going,"" Chaumont said this week in an interview. ""Building a company, particularly in crypto, is always about making contrarian bets and seeing what others didn't see. We are not very sensitive to short-term macro events. That's why we have always been very enthusiastic about the U.S. for crypto innovation. It's a land of innovation and a huge market for everyone.""  Since Chaumont's comments at Consensus 2023, the price of bitcoin {{BTC}} has climbed almost 150%, according to CoinDesk Indices data, and the U.S. regulatory environment has improved with the SEC approving the introduction of bitcoin ETFs and set to agree to ether ETFs as well.  First mover advantage  Expanding U.S. headcount in 2023 when things looked bleak meant Flowdesk had a first-mover advantage when the market picked up.  ""Now we are grabbing significant market share, and our company is in better conditions than ever – profitable with a huge increase in volumes and revenues,"" he said. ""Fueled by the ETF approval earlier this year, we started to see more positive news, and we were like, 'Okay, our bet is probably going to pay off.'""  The situation may have vastly improved, but there's still some work to be done even as the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) – which has been praised by some industry stakeholders as a step in the right direction – goes to the Senate with bipartisan support.  For instance, there's an added complexity in the market when dealing with U.S. counterparties because of the layers of licenses, meaning that there are still some operational limitations in the market.  Another headache is custody. Chaumont argued that the U.S. needs a simplified and globally harmonized regulatory framework for custody, which, if done right, could unlock massive business potential.  Many problems could be solved with harmonization, and Chaumont points to the European Union's MiCA regulations as an instance where that works well. There are lessons to be learned from the EU's approach, he said, which rules out the need for multiple licenses from individual states. That's the situation that persists in the U.S.  ""In Europe, you do not need to get multiple registrations,"" he said. ""Once you are registered in one country, you can operate across the entire region.""  A lot has happened in the U.S. in the past year and, who knows, maybe such harmonization will be on the agenda when it's time for Consensus 2025.  ""If there were not these bottlenecks and uncertainties, we could have grown three times faster, like we did in France,"" Chaumont said.

31109914,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=630128,1721208600,‘Most Bullish Setup Ever’: Crypto Analyst Lists 10 Reasons To Invest Now,"In a new post on X, Miles Deutscher, a noted crypto analyst with over half a million followers, has proclaimed the current market condition as “one of the most bullish setups” he has seen in his six-year career in the crypto industry. Deutscher outlined ten pivotal catalysts that he believes are primed to drive the cryptocurrency markets higher in the near term. “There has been a lot of talk recently about headwinds (Germans selling, Gox, macro etc.). But the reality is, there is A LOT to look forward to,” Deutscher emphasized. 10 Reasons To Be Ultra Bullish On Crypto #1 German Government BTC Sales: Deutscher notes that the German government has exhausted its BTC reserves to sell, which removes a significant selling pressure on the market. “The best thing about overhang is that once selling is priced into the market, there is a floor on downside and headroom for price to move higher. We still have Gox, but there’s now light at the end of the tunnel,” he explained. #2 Bitcoin ETF Inflows: According to Deutscher, the strong inflows into Bitcoin ETFs are underappreciated. Over the past month, these ETFs have seen inflows exceeding $1 billion, signaling sustained investor interest. “I think many people are underestimating the magnitude of the long-term impact of the ETFs on BTC. It provides a strong passive bid for the market, and appetite for the ETF isn’t going away (we’ve had +$1b this past month),” Deutscher added. Related Reading: Solana’s Dogwifhat (WIF) Skyrockets 1300% And Claims Forbes’ Best-Performing Crypto Title #3 US Presidential Election: The crypto analyst pointed out betting markets like Polymarket, where Trump is favored to win. A Trump presidency is viewed as a positive catalyst for crypto, given his administration’s perceived support for the industry. #4 Trump Advocacy at BTC 2024 Conference: Deutscher also highlighted Trump’s scheduled appearance at the BTC 2024 conference, where he is expected to advocate for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies more broadly. Rumors have it that Trump could make another major announcement. Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey has floated the idea of making BTC a strategic reserve asset for the United States. #5 FTX Repayments: The repayment of $16 billion to creditors by FTX is a less discussed but crucial factor. “Many of these recipients will likely re-enter the market, leading to a fresh bid,” Deutscher predicts, suggesting a potential increase in buying activity in the crypto markets. #6 Global Liquidity Cycle: Deutscher also mentioned the correlation between global liquidity and crypto prices. “It’s crazy how correlated crypto (especially BTC) is to global liquidity. Interestingly, we’ve been closely following a 65-month cycle. This would suggest a late 2025 peak,” Deutscher predicted. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Ethereum Price Is Headed To $4,000, Here’s Why #7 Spot ETH ETFs: The imminent launch of Spot ETH ETFs is another major catalyst. This marks the first time an altcoin has received such an investment vehicle, potentially expanding Ethereum’s market exposure and investor base dramatically. #8 Goldman Sachs Tokenization Projects: Goldman Sachs’ involvement in three tokenization projects lends significant credibility to the crypto space. This institutional endorsement is expected to benefit a wide array of altcoins and related real-world asset (RWA) applications. #9 Anticipated Rate Cuts: According to the CME FedWatch tool, the market is currently factoring in the likelihood of three rate cuts until the end of the year, with a 90% chance of a 25 basis point reduction in September. This could serve a massive tailwind. #10 Forward-Looking Markets: Lastly, Deutscher emphasized the reflexive nature of crypto markets, where positive sentiment itself can trigger substantial rallies. “Over the coming months, you’re likely to see the market price in these tailwinds. As crypto is highly reflexive, a positive bid off the back of increased sentiment can, in and of itself, lead to a major rally,” Deutscher concluded. At press time, BTC traded at $65,648.

But Trump has shrugged off these concerns, telling Bloomberg he aims to make the economy great again through his ""Trumponomics"" plan that equates to low interest rates and taxes. This would be ""tremendous incentive to get things done and to bring business back to our country."" Here's what Trump plans on doing if he wins the election: Economy, jobs Trump will let Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell finish his term, which ends in May 2026. ""I would let him serve it out,"" he said, ""especially if I thought he was doing the right thing."" But he said the Fed shouldn't cut interest rates before the November election, giving the economy (and Biden) a boost. ""It's something they know they shouldn't be doing,"" he said. Markets see two rate cuts this year, with one likely before the election in September. Trump would consider JPMorgan ( JPM ) CEO Jamie Dimon as Treasury secretary, softening his opinion on the bank chief from last year, when he called Dimon a ""highly overrated globalist."" To tackle inflation, Trump plans to bring down prices by paving the way for more oil and gas drilling. ""We have more liquid gold than anybody,"" he said. He also believes his proposed trade tariffs will produce a windfall for the U.S., although economists say his plan would likely fuel higher inflation and taxes for consumers. Trump is planning harsh immigration restrictions that he believes will boost domestic employment, reiterating that jobs are being taken by illegal immigrants. To note, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that naturalized U.S. citizens and legal residents have seen the most employment gains since 2018. Taxes, social media, crypto Trump wants to bring the corporate tax rate down to 15%, even lower than his pledge last month to CEOs of cutting the rate to 20% from the current 21%. He is also planning less regulation. As for social media, Trump believes companies have become ""too big, too powerful."" Even so, he won't ban TikTok , owned by ByteDance ( BDNCE ), citing the need for competition. ""If you don't have TikTok, you have Facebook and Instagram - and that's Zuckerberg,"" he said, still bitter over Facebook's decision to bar him after the January 6 Capitol attack. While he previously said bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is a scam, Trump now believes the top cryptocurrency and other cryptos should be made in the U.S. ""If we don't do it, China is going to figure it out - or somebody else."" Foreign policy Trump plans on imposing new tariffs on China ranging from 60% to 100%, as well as a 10% tariff on imports from other countries to ensure economic fairness. As for defending Taiwan from China, Trump appeared to be skeptical. ""Taiwan took our chip business from us,"" he said. ""I mean, how stupid are we?"" Instead, he said Taiwan should pay the U.S. for protection. When asked if Saudi Arabia would be upset over increased U.S. drilling, Trump disagreed , given his closeness with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud.

42417697,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZZ7d,1721206197,"XRP Surges 12% on the Back of Triangle Pattern, Rising Futures Bets Favor Bullish Price Moves Ahead","XRP surged 12% to extend weekly gains to over 40%, beating other major tokens.  A bullish triangle pattern on XRP's long-term price charts and a substantial increase in open interest suggest more upside in the coming weeks.  XRP surged 12% in the past 24 hours to lead gains among crypto majors, beating bitcoin {{BTC}} and the broader CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index.  The token added 5% since the start of Asian trading hours on Wednesday to extend seven-day gains to nearly 40%, making it the best-performing major despite favorable regulatory developments for ether (ETH) and demand for meme coins.  ""XRP has been performing worse than the market for a long time, but the reversal of sentiment in crypto has sparked a rise on steroids in the once-largest altcoin. On the latest bounce, the price rose to 60 cents, its highest since April. This is an attempt to jump back into the uptrend of the past two years, "" Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro senior market analyst said.  However, it may well turn out that XRP needs to rest after the climb. And this high is appropriate, as we saw prolonged consolidations here in November-December and March, Kuptsikevich added.  Gains in the token started last week as traditional futures powerhouses CME and CF Benchmarks announced the debut of indices and reference rates for XRP. And such moves have formed a triangle pattern on long-term price charts, which some popular traders say could favor bullish action in the coming weeks.  “I have never seen a 7-year-long bull pennant,” posted crypto trader Michael Monten, who goes by @MichaelXBT on X. “We might be about to witness one of the most significant breakouts in crypto history.”  The triangle pattern is a popular technical analysis chart formation that helps traders understand market sentiment and spot emerging trends. It forms when an asset's price trades in a narrow range following an uptrend or downtrend.  Chartists see a breakout from a triangular pattern, especially on heavy volumes, as bullish, which may favor upward price movements.  Meanwhile, open interest on futures tracking XRP has more than doubled in the past seven days, suggesting increased expectations of future price volatility. Open interest is the amount of unsettled futures trades.  CoinGlass data shows that XRP futures had racked up over $780 million in bets as of Wednesday, up from the $420 million on July 9, bringing it to levels last seen in mid-April. Trading volumes for the tokens have surged from $2 billion to $3.6 billion in the period, CoinGecko data shows.  Over 60% of XRP futures bets opened in the past 24 hours are longs, or bets on higher prices, data from Coinalyze shows. Such a bump in open interest, alongside trading volumes, indicates new money entering the market and expecting XRP to rise higher.",POSITIVE,BTC | XRP,BTC | MARKET | TRADING | XRP | TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/17/xrp-surges-12-on-the-back-of-triangle-pattern-rising-futures-bets-favor-bullish-price-moves-ahead,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3e0c63cfaf32c09f1513d135ba4f492bdedd627f-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Traders said these options will help define risk and protect capital from expected volatility in the lead-up to and following the binary event.  Leading crypto options exchange Deribit announced new options on Tuesday that would allow traders to effectively manage their bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}} positions in the context of the outcome of the pivotal U.S. presidential elections on Nov. 4.  The introduction of the so-called election expiry options tied to market leaders bitcoin and ether has garnered positive feedback from traders.  ""The U.S. election is a focal point for risk assets [including crypto] and will have a binary effect on fiscal policy and financial stability. Options are an important tool for hedging this uncertainty, so it's natural for Deribit to list this tenor,"" Jeff Anderson, a senior trader at STS Digital, told CoinDesk.  The impending election may be most important for cryptocurrencies, as Republican candidate Donald Trump has recently embraced digital assets, standing apart from his rival incumbent, Joe Biden. Though Trump has not yet set out detailed proposals for crypto regulation, his recent outreach to bitcoin miners and his promised appearance at the upcoming Nashville conference has won him the industry's support, establishing BTC and the wider market as a bet on his presidency.  As such, BTC and ETH could see increased price volatility in the lead-up to and after the elections, necessitating increased investor focus on using derivatives like options to hedge their portfolios. Options offer insurance against bullish or bearish price moves in the underlying asset. A call option protects against upside volatility while a put hedges against price slides.  Deribit's election expiry options will go live on July 18 at 8:00 UTC and expire on Nov. 8, or three days after the election results due on Nov. 5. On Deribit, one option contract represents one BTC or ETH.  ""These options are a smart move from Deribit; they will allow traders to position themselves ahead, during and after the elections with a three-day buffer after the result. It's a great way to get leverage and a hedge on your exposure simultaneously,"" Laurent Kssis, crypto ETF specialist at CEC Capital, told CoinDesk.  Traditional market traders use options to manage their exposure when facing binary events like U.S. elections or corporate earnings whose outcome is uncertain.  ""If a trader believed an asset may have an explosive move in either direction, as a result of a binary headline event, they could buy a straddle, which is buying the same strike price put and call, with an expiration date after the headline event,"" global derivatives giant CME's explainer titled ""using equity options in an election year"" says.  ""We often see these types of trades placed before a major macroeconomic release or a company earnings report.

OKX's CMO Haider Rafique said TON had been a break-out hit with a strong community behind it.  OKX added support for the Toncoin (TON) network associated with the Telegram messaging app to OKX Wallet, marking the 100th protocol as it builds on its “on-chain, any chain” philosophy.  The wallet, a standalone Web3 product that operates separately from the centralized exchange (CEX), integrates into OKX's decentralized exchange (DEX).  While OKX tries to provide access to a wide variety of tokens and protocols for its wallet, it also wants to provide a curated experience and not every token meets its standards, Chief Marketing Officer Haider Rafique said in an interview.  ""Our listing process typically revolves around a couple of things. First, we want to see some terminal velocity before considering a listing,"" Rafique said. ""We aim for the right timing when there's already a built-up community and significant demand. If we launch something without sufficient demand, it doesn't fit well with our role.""  Market data from CoinMarketCap shows that TON has been a breakout hit with OKX. It is the sixth most-traded coin on the centralized exchange, just behind the BTC-USDT trading pair and the SOL-USDT pair. Trading for TON tends to increase whenever new gamification features are introduced, Rafique said, observing that these features drive user interest and engagement.  ""The utility most people are excited about is the ease of participating in-network incentives and programs. This gamification aspect is the most popular, based on various signals we track,"" he said. ""Of course, there are speculators who just want to hold the token, hoping it appreciates because it's backed by Telegram.""  As CoinDesk has reported, this growing TON-based economy, using Telegram as a hub, has driven the token's recent outperformance of the broader crypto market.  Before supporting TON, OKX Wallet expanded its capabilities by adding support for the NEAR, Blast, and zkLink Nova chains, according to a release.  OKX Wallet also recently integrated Uniswap Labs' trading APIs and launched a platform for Web3 game developers.

31107688,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=630127,1721205008,Expert Foresees XRP Soaring To $250: Technical Analysis Explained,"Crypto expert “The Great Mattsby” has found something interesting on the XRP monthly chart: the Bollinger Bands are the smallest they have ever been. This trend has shown huge price changes in the past, which has led to rumours that XRP is about to make a big rise. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Prepares For Major Burn As Liquidity Surpasses $800 Million Historical Patterns: Previous Explosions And Current Expectations Mattsby looked at patterns before XRP’s price shot up after its Bollinger Bands found themselves in a tight range. One pattern was from September 2016 and March 2017, when its price went up by a huge 60,000%. In comparison, a similar trend in April 2021 resulted in a relatively modest 1,000% increase. According to Mattsby, the current situation is different; the bands are even tighter than previously, implying an oncoming and maybe bigger price movement. A $250 $XRP by 2028?? So a ±60000% $XRP does line up with the math of that green angle, which was also a very important support and resistance angle in the past (highlighted). Proof that its not impossiblehttps://t.co/LDzEiKjz5Z pic.twitter.com/v0qHTg9MFv — The Great Mattsby (@matthughes13) July 11, 2024 “It’s like a coiled spring ready to unleash,” Mattsby explained in his most recent video. “The breakout force increases as the bands tighten.” This observation is consistent with the technical notion that low volatility is frequently followed by periods of high volatility. XRP’s All-Time High: The Long Road To Recovery It’s been more than 2,000 days since XRP hit a high point of $3.31. The altcoin is worth $0.5345 right now, which is 84% less than its all-time high. Mattsby is still hopeful, though. The long time of stabilisation, along with the extremely tight Bollinger Bands, makes him think that a big price move is coming. Mattsby saw that the Bollinger Bands for Bitcoin and Ethereum are not as tight as those for XRP. This unique thing about XRP’s data makes it stand out. Even though Bitcoin and Ethereum are strong competitors in the cryptocurrency market, their Bollinger Bands don’t show that they are about to break out, he said. XRP market cap currently at $34.2 billion. Chart: TradingView.com The $250 Prediction Mattsby is so optimistic that he even dares to say that XRP will hit $250 by 2028. Using Gann’s theory, he found that the 45° angle was a key level of support and barrier for XRP’s price history. He thinks XRP will go in this direction, maybe to test it as support before bursting into the $250 level of resistance. Related Reading: Big Filecoin Rally Ahead: Analyst Predicts 4,000% ‘Uphill Run’ Mattsby supported his projection by using Fibonacci retracement from XRP’s 2013 high to its 2014 low, finding important levels that XRP may hit. He points out that the 3.618 extension level is quite near to his $250 goal price. “If Bitcoin and Tesla can reach comparable Fibonacci extensions, there’s no reason XRP can’t,” he said.

Bitwise said money flowing into new ether spot ETFs will have a larger impact than it did for bitcoin.  Ether spot ETFs are expected to draw in $15 billion of net inflows in the first 18 months.  The launch of spot ether {{ETH}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S., expected to occur next week, will push the price of the second largest cryptocurrency to all-time highs above $5,000, Bitwise said.  It may not happen immediately and price action may be choppy to start, due to money flowing out of the $11 billion Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), after it converts to an ETF, Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan wrote in a report on Tuesday.  Still, “by year-end, I'm confident the new highs will be in,” Hougan wrote, “and if flows are stronger than many market commentators expect, the price could be much higher still.”  Bitwise notes that bitcoin {{BTC}} has risen about 25% since the launch of spot ETFs in the U.S. in January, and more than 110% since the market began pricing in a potential launch in October last year.  The money flowing into new ether spot ETFs will have a larger impact than it did for bitcoin for three structural reasons, Bitwise said. Ether’s short-term inflation rate is 0% and when bitcoin versions launched the network’s inflation rate was 1.7%, so there is significant demand meeting zero supply. Unlike bitcoin miners ETH stakers don’t have to sell, and 28% of ETH is staked and therefore off the market.  Ether spot ETFs are expected to be a success and garner $15 billion of net inflows in their first 18 months of trading, the report added.  Steno Research expressed a similarly bullish outlook for the cryptocurrency in a report last month. It predicted that ether would reach at least $6,500 later this year due to expected inflows to spot ETFs, plus additional tailwinds.

The crypto community pointed to the irony of Menendez getting convicted for corruption given he had labelled bitcoin as ""an ideal choice for criminals.""  U.S. Senator Bob Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey and staunch crypto critic, was found guilty of accepting bribes, including gold bars and a luxury car, in exchange for his political clout by a jury on Tuesday.  The development saw the crypto community point out the irony of a crypto critic who once alleged that bitcoin {{BTC}} ""is an ideal choice for criminals"" getting convicted as a criminal.  Menendez was also a co-sponsor of a bill titled ""Accountability for Cryptocurrency in El Salvador (ACES) Act"" which would have required the State Department to report on mitigating risks to the U.S. financial system from El Salvador's adoption of bitcoin as legal tender.  Stacy Herbert, a member of The National Bitcoin Office (ONBTC) of El Salvador under President Nayib Bukele, wrote on X that while Senator Menendez was ""hiding bars of ill-gotten gold... President Bukele was establishing the most transparent government in the world by posting El Salvador’s public bitcoin address for all the world to audit.""  Herbert added that the ""malign actor was Bob Menendez"" and that The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which Menendez was the chairman of ""owes President Bukele and El Salvador an apology.""  ""I have never been anything but a patriot of my country and for my country. I have never, ever been a foreign agent,"" Menendez said outside the courthouse after the verdict made him the first sitting member of Congress to be convicted of acting as a foreign agent.  ""This wasn’t politics as usual; this was politics for profit,"" said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams in a statement. ""Because Senator Menendez has now been found guilty, his years of selling his office to the highest bidder have finally come to an end.""  Menendez was a congressperson since 1993, entering the Senate in 2006, has so far refused to resign despite numerous calls from senior colleagues to do so, including from Democratic Senate Majority leader Chuck Schumer.

42390732,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd8Tpb,1721201400,Standard Chartered-Backed Zodia Markets to Buy Elwood Trading Desk,"Elwood will focus on its trading technology software-as-a-service products and services.  Zodia Markets’ $50 million-$60 million a day OTC business expects to “increase daily volumes significantly,” as a result of the deal.  Zodia Markets, a cryptocurrency-focused trading firm backed by the venture arm of Standard Chartered, said it is buying the over-the-counter trading division of Elwood Technologies, confirming media reports the unit was on the block and sale talks were in process.  After offloading the business, Elwood, which was championed by crypto-friendly billionaire Alan Howard, will focus on its trading technology software-as-a-service (SaaS) products and services, the company said on Monday.  Confidence is running high in the institutional crypto space, with regulated bank-backed projects and qualified custodians building out a base of trading infrastructure to meet the demands of traditional capital markets.  Zodia Markets’ OTC business now handles trading volumes of as much as $60 million a day, according to CEO Usman Ahmad. He did not share details of how much customer volume is likely to come Zodia’s way from the deal, but said via email that the firm expects to “increase daily volumes significantly.” He also declined to share financial terms of the deal.  Standard Chartered, which was reported recently to be entering the crypto spot trading space, is a backer (through the SC Ventures business) of both Zodia Markets and its sister operation, Zodia Custody.  Usman said the deal would not overlap with Standard Chartered’s crypto trading aspirations. “This transaction is an enabler for Zodia Markets’ growth and doesn’t overlap with what Standard Chartered may or may not do directly in trading spot crypto,” he said.  Crypto markets, coming out of a long bear market, remain choppy. Elwood CEO Chris Lawn said the decision to sell the OTC business was not about a bull or bear market, but instead an illustration of how the digital assets industry is maturing, with new entrants demanding institutional-grade SaaS solutions.  “Increased competition and M&A will force companies to ask tough questions as to who and what they really are,” Lawn said in an email. “For us, the answer is we are a technology company, hence the strategic decision to focus all of our efforts on this part of our business and to sell the OTC business.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/07/17/standard-chartered-backed-zodia-markets-to-buy-elwood-trading-desk,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9465cd56f19f34914cc31899477d32e9c45b025c-2928x1647.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Reduced selling pressure from key wallets and a more positive political outlook for the crypto sector have contributed to the bullish sentiment, despite recent volatility and concerns over Mt. Gox repayments.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} traders expect prices to touch as much as $70,000 in the near term as sentiment around the broader crypto sector bumps ahead of the U.S. elections and selling pressure from key wallets subsides.  “The rebound in Bitcoin price shows the market has a more optimistic outlook in the near-term macro environment,” shared Lucy Hu, senior analyst at Metalpha, in a Wednesday message to CoinDesk. “The market was encouraged by Trump’s vice president pick, which indicates a more crypto-friendly administration and policies.”  “BTC could hover around the 120-day moving average, and the price may have the momentum to go up to $68k or even $70k, but we need to continue to monitor closely the Fed policies and implications of Mt Gox,” Hu added.  Moving average is a technical indicator that sums price data over time to determine a trend's direction. A 120-day moving average is widely used as a long-term indicator.  BTC showcased rollercoaster price action in the past few weeks, dropping to as low as $53,500 in early July as wallets from defunct exchange Mt. Gox started their bitcoin repayments, triggering bearish predictions.  But favorable developments have since put bulls back on track. Wallets linked to the German state of Saxony have emptied their entire stack of bitcoin. At the same time, Republican candidate Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance has ushered in renewed hope.  Trump has picked Ohio senator JD Vance, a crypto-friendly figure, as his 2024 running mate. In 2022, Vance held as much as $250,000 worth of BTC.  “A change in perspective on the digital assets industry in the US is creating expectations of more favorable policy toward Bitcoin and crypto as the elections look to capture single issue voters and special interest groups,” shared Nick Ruck, head of growth at BitU Protocol, in a Telegram message.  “There’s also less expected sell pressure in the long term as Mt Gox distributes funds to creditors,” Ruck added.

Of those giving the asset increasing attention is Peter Brandt, a veteran trader who has recently shared exciting insights into Ethereum’s price action. Renowned for his decades-long track record in financial markets, the veteran trader has provided Ethereum’s highly optimistic technical analysis. Through his analysis of Ethereum’s price movements, Brandt predicts a potential surge that could redefine ETH’s current market standing. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Breakout Moment: Is a $7,500 Target Achievable? Experts Weigh In $5600 On The Horizon Based On This Brandt’s projections are based on recently discovered a “four-month rectangle” on the Ethereum price chart. This pattern indicates a consolidation phase, where Ethereum has fluctuated within a stable price range. According to Brandt, such consolidation might be the calm before a significant upward breakout. This view provides investors with hope, and it is also consistent with general sentiment confirming that periods in which the price remains stable usually precede a bullish reversal. Delving deeper into the technical aspects, Brandt pointed to the “horn bottom.” This formation on the chart can be seen as a bullish reversal pattern indicating that ETH has always remained above critical support levels, regardless of how often it has tested lower limits. This horn bottom pattern is also associated with increasing buying pressure, indicating a rally may occur shortly. Brandt further substantiated his analysis by sharing a chart with his followers on X, detailing the technical patterns and setting a bold price target for Ethereum that exceeds $5,600.

Related Reading: Why Is The Ethereum Price Up Today?

The tokenization platform will soon offer an “e-note” for hemp and CBD producer AgroRef.  Cryptocurrency trading firm XBTO has created a new tokenization team focused on real world assets (RWAs), driving forward blockchain-based corporate debt issuances the firm has been working on, with areas like real estate to follow.  Much of the tokenization attention has been on large banks like JPMorgan and asset management giants like BlackRock, who have been focused for the most part on blockchain-based versions of U.S. Treasuries.  Arguably closer to real world scenarios, the Bermuda-based XBTO has been working on mid-tier corporate debt issuances, including two instances of tokenized debt, or “senior e-notes,” by boutique airline BermudAir. In the coming weeks, hemp and CBD producer AgroRef is also launching an e-note on XBTO.  The new tokenization team, led by MD Mas Nakachi, works with on-chain capital markets platform Obligate, with the e-notes rated by Credora, a platform that produces technology-driven credit assessments, XBTO said.  A mid-sized or smallish company looking at financing may lack access to those markets and find it punitive to issue financing in the traditional way, dealing with the costs of an investment bank, said Javier Rodriguez Alarcon, chief commercial officer of XBTO.  “Reducing the cost burden for private companies to be able to issue can also be translated into a better rate for the investor and a more appealing investment proposition,” Rodriguez Alarcon said in an interview. “On top of that there's the speed to settlement and the transparency associated with using the rails of crypto.”  XBTO, which is regulated in Bermuda, offers its tokenized assets to accredited investors, and only those outside the U.S.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/07/17/crypto-trading-firm-xbto-establishes-tokenization-team-to-focus-on-real-world-assets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9340f15ad9b2c8c61ff07b06271ada9ce2654356-720x406.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross Has Been Inside Oversold Region Recently As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the cryptocurrency could enter into a recovery phase based on the NVT Golden Cross reading. The “NVT ratio” is an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the Bitcoin market cap and the network’s transaction volume (both in USD). Related Reading: XRP & Litecoin See Social Media FOMO: Bad Sign For Prices? When the value of this metric is high, it means that the cryptocurrency’s value (that is, its market cap) is high compared to its ability to transact coins (the transaction volume). Such a trend could imply the asset is overpriced right now. On the other hand, the indicator assuming a low value implies the market cap isn’t overinflated compared to the transaction volume, so the coin could have room to see a surge. In the context of the current topic, the NVT ratio itself isn’t of interest, but rather a modified version called the NVT Golden Cross. This metric compares the NVT ratio’s short-term trend against its long-term trend to identify the indicator’s tops and bottoms. The 10-day moving average (MA) represents the short-term trend, while the 30-day MA corresponds to the long-term trend. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the NVT Golden Cross for Bitcoin over the past few years: In the graph, the quant has highlighted two historically important regions for the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross. In the zone above 2.2, the asset may be considered overvalued and due a correction. Similarly, the region below the -1.6 line is where bottoms have occurred, as the coin becomes underpriced here. The chart shows that the indicator’s value has recently declined in this latter zone. The last time the NVT Golden Cross declined into the undervalued zone was during the market downturn that had followed the spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval at the start of the year. This drop was succeeded by the cryptocurrency’s rally towards a new all-time high (ATH). Thus, it’s possible that Bitcoin could also end up enjoying a rally this time. The surge may also have already begun, as the coin has recovered beyond the $64,000 level since its plunge under $54,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hasn’t Reached Bull Cycle Top Yet, Quant Explains Why Despite this rally, the NVT Golden Cross still has a value of -1.8, within the undervalued zone. If this indicator is anything to go by, the run could still have room to go. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $64,900, up 13% in the past week.

BlackRock's IBIT amassed over $260 million on Tuesday, accounting for a giant share of the cumulative inflows. FBTC drew $61.1 million, while others, except GBTC, DEFI and BTCW, pulled in less than $30 million each.  These funds have collectively drawn in over $1 billion in just the last three days, underscoring investors' confidence in bitcoin's price prospects.  BTC has surged 23% to $65,800 since hitting a low near $53,500 on July 5, CoinDesk data. In addition to the ETF inflows, the price recovery may be linked to the exhaustion of selling pressure from Germany's Saxony state, dramatic improvement in the probability of pro-crypto Republican candidate Donald Trump winning the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 4 and Trump's decision to appoint BTC-holder and Ohio Republican senator James David Vance as vice president.  Vance has supported BTC and digital assets since 2021 and began circulating a draft version of crypto legislation last month.  ""It is notable that Vance advanced crypto legislation at a moment when he knew he was being considered by Trump for VP. This highlights the new-found political relevance of crypto, but also the extent to which digital asset policy has become a part of the Republican vision for the US economy,"" FRNT Financial said in the newsletter Tuesday.  ""Additionally, given that Trump can only serve another four years if elected, the VP decision was also seen as a choice on political succession. It is additionally encouraging for the crypto community that Trump’s seeming political successor is a BTC holder and has prioritized crypto-friendly legislation,"" FRNT added.  It's also likely that with the supply overhang from Saxony behind us, the crypto market is catching up the sustained rally in technology stocks on Wall Street. Such is the optimism that reports of renewed creditor reimbursements from defunct exchange Mt. Gox on Tuesday failed to keep BTC prices under pressure for long.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/17/bitcoin-etf-inflows-hit-six-week-high-of-4225m,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a2ff4fad1e610074f7f54250dcd921d9e1f2e328-1441x950.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

During Q1, the market soared 64.5%, doubling Q3 2024’s growth. In absolute terms, the growth of this quarter (+$1.1 trillion) was almost double that of the previous quarter (+$0.61 trillion).

After hitting a five-month low of $0.00001274 on July 5, the coin has gained 8% in the past 24 hours and is up a steady 20% over the past week. However, a prediction report published by Forbes suggests that the Ethereum-based altcoin is poised for major price gains throughout the rest of the year and may even surpass all-time highs. Expert Insights For SHIB According to the report, industry experts such as Himanshu Maradiya, founder and chairman of CIFDAQ Blockchain Ecosystem, offered a prediction for SHIB’s price by 2024-2025, ranging from $0.0001 to $0.0003, depending on favorable market conditions and continued ecosystem development. This would position SHIB’s price for a potential gain of 416% in the scenario of reaching the $0.0001 mark and even a substantial increase of 1440% in the case of reaching the $0.0003 benchmark. Related Reading: Ark Invest’s Bitcoin Report: Why They Bet Big On BTC’s Recovery On the other hand, Utkarsh Tiwari, Chief Strategy Officer of KoinBX, emphasized the difficulty of predicting cryptocurrency prices, including SHIB. Nevertheless, he noted the bullish sentiment surrounding SHIB and suggested a more conservative approach, stating a potential price range of $0.0000298 to $0.0000396 by the end of 2024. Tiwari also highlighted the importance of monitoring price movements, stating that if SHIB surpasses $0.00003682 and continues its upward trajectory, it could target $0.00006697 in 2024. Conversely, a price reversal could see SHIB drop to $0.000010, indicating the presence of decline risks. Shiba Inu Price Predictions According to the prediction algorithm of the crypto data platform Coincodex, Shiba Inu’s price predictions for the coming years are as follows: 2024 Prediction: SHIB is projected to trade between $0.00001453 and $0.00003859, with the upper price target representing a potential increase of 123.30% to reach $0.00003859. 2025 Prediction: Coincodex predicts SHIB will trade between $0.00001453 and $0.00007515 in 2025. Reaching the higher value target would signify a significant increase of 332.26% to reach $0.00007515. 2030 Prediction: The price prediction for Shiba Inu in 2030 ranges from $0.00002237 on the lower end to $0.00006428 on the higher end, with the upper price target indicating a potential gain of 270.72% to reach $0.00006428. Possibility of Reaching $0.01: While the enthusiasm surrounding SHIB is evident, reaching $0.01 would require a staggering gain of 46,144.44%. However, according to Coincodex’s prediction algorithm, SHIB is unlikely to reach $0.01. According to the algorithm, the highest expected price is estimated to be $0.000852 by January 1, 2049. Related Reading: Why Is The Ethereum Price Up Today? At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.0001939, still recording losses of 6.7% in the monthly time frame, illustrating the price correction the meme coin has undergone.

Breaking Resistance Could Trigger God Candles In an X (formerly Twitter) post on June 14, a crypto analyst identified as ‘Dark Defender’ provided a detailed interpretation of technical indicators and resistance levels that could signal a bullish uptrend for XRP. The analyst revealed that XRP has experienced a highly bullish reversal for the Fisher Indicator on the weekly chart. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Ethereum Price Is Headed To $4,000, Here’s Why The Fisher Indicator is a versatile technical tool used to pinpoint trend reversals and highlight when prices have moved to the extreme. Based on this technical indicator, Dark Defender has revealed that the altcoin has broken through an initial price resistance at $0.04623, indicating strength and momentum in the cryptocurrency’s price movement. Sharing a price chart depicting XRP’s movements, the crypto analyst unveiled that the altcoin’s price is currently testing the interim Fibonacci levels at $0.5286. He expressed bullish optimism about XRP closing above the week’s candle around the $0.53 price mark. Dark Defender also highlighted the next significant resistance level for XRP’s price. The analyst expects XRP to test secondary mid-level resistance points at $0.6044, as breaking this level would be a positive signal for a higher upward momentum for XRP. Interestingly, Dark Defender expects XRP to trigger God candles if it successfully breaks all the aforementioned resistance levels. He highlighted another key support level at $0.6649, labeling it the master fundamental level. The crypto analyst disclosed that it was crucial to not underestimate this level, signaling the potential for strong bullish surge in XRP if it surpasses this key threshold. The analyst has predicted multiple God candles that indicate sharp price increases for XRP, possibly opening up a path to “Heaven’s Stairway.” Update On XRP Price Analysis Amidst recent legal challenges with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and broader market downtrend, XRP has been displaying strong bullish signals and healthy price fundamentals. At some point this year, the cryptocurrency plummeted below the $0.5 price mark, experiencing unexpected price declines. Related Reading: Ethereum Bulls Gear Up For Recovery – Can Spot ETFs Push Price To New Highs? However, recently, the altcoin has been on a roll, recording multiple bullish surges that have pushed its price to its current value of $0.538. According to data from CoinMarketCap, XRP has soared by almost 30% over the past week and risen by another 1.41% in the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency has been performing relatively well despite market volatility. Its recent gains have also positioned it at a critical point where its price could potentially surge above the $0.6 threshold. Additionally, with the Ripple vs. SEC legal battle nearing conclusion and a settlement on the horizon, XRP is poised to overcome bearish sentiment fueled by regulatory concerns.

Weighted Sentiment Has Spiked For Both XRP & Litecoin Recently According to data from the analytics firm Santiment, LTC and XRP are among the coins that have seen an improvement in sentiment following the recent price recovery. The indicator of interest here is the “Weighted Sentiment,” based on two other metrics: Sentiment Balance and Social Volume. The Sentiment Balance tells us about the current net sentiment on major social media platforms. This indicator works by putting posts/threads/messages related to a given coin through a machine-learning model to identify whether they are positive or negative. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hasn’t Reached Bull Cycle Top Yet, Quant Explains Why Once the metric has found out the number of posts of each type, it takes their difference to determine the net situation around the asset on social media. There is perhaps one flaw in the Sentiment Balance, though, and it’s the fact that it contains no information about how many users share this sentiment. Sometimes, discussion around the cryptocurrency can be low, so whatever the metric would signal would only correlate to what the few users talking about it think, which may not necessarily relate to the majority. The Weighted Sentiment fixes this problem by also incorporating Social Volume data. The Social Volume keeps track of the degree of talk that any given asset receives on social media platforms. Thus, the Weighted Sentiment only registers a spike (in either direction) when not only does the Sentiment Balance have a high value but also the Social Volume is signaling the presence of high discussions. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in this metric for Litecoin and XRP over the past month: As displayed in the above graph, the Weighted Sentiment has seen spikes into the positive territory for both XRP and Litecoin with their recent price surges. This suggests that many positive posts have appeared around these coins. Historically, highly positive sentiment has been a bearish sign for any asset, with tops becoming probable as investors FOMO. The chart shows that XRP had seen a rise in FOMO earlier in the month, and the cryptocurrency had set a top alongside this spike. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears Crushed: $100M In Crypto Shorts See Flush As BTC Breaks $63,000 As such, the latest spike in the Weighted Sentiment may not be ideal for the recovery runs that XRP and Litecoin have started. “These coins can continue to rise, but the crowd’s euphoria toward these assets could make them high-risk, high-reward investments this week,” notes the analytics firm. XRP Price XRP has enjoyed a rally of almost 26% in the past week, which has taken its price back above the $0.54 level.
