42409371,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcGrPh,1700869363,"Binance Founder Changpeng 'CZ' Zhao Isn't a Flight Risk, His Attorneys Say","Binance founder Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao poses ""no risk of flight"" and should be allowed to return to the United Arab Emirates for now, a Thursday filing said.  The partially redacted document pushed back against a U.S. Department of Justice filing, arguing that Zhao should not be allowed to leave the U.S. ahead of his February sentencing after pleading guilty to one charge of violating the Bank Secrecy Act. Zhao has already demonstrated he won't be a flight risk by the very fact that he came to the U.S. to enter that plea, his attorneys argued. The Magistrate Judge overseeing his case, Judge Brian Tsuchida, already agreed that Zhao showing up to begin with is compelling, the filing said.  ""Based on all the relevant facts, including Mr. Zhao’s voluntary self-surrender, his intent to resolve this case, and the sizable bail package he proposed, Judge Tsuchida found that Mr. Zhao presents no risk of flight, even while residing in the UAE,"" the filing said.  Read more: Binance to Pay $4.3B to Settle U.S. Criminal Case; Changpeng 'CZ' Zhao Resigns as CEO and Pleads Guilty in Seattle  Binance pleaded guilty to multiple charges alongside Zhao earlier this week, agreeing to pay a massive $4.3 billion fine, appoint monitors to oversee its compliance program and review its past transactions and accept Zhao's resignation as CEO. Former Binance regional markets head Richard Teng has taken over as CEO.  Zhao was released on a $175 million personal recognizance bond on Tuesday. Still, his attorneys and the DOJ have been arguing over whether he can return to the UAE, where he is a citizen and where his family lives, or if he must stay in the U.S. If Zhao returns to the UAE, he must come back to the U.S. two weeks before sentencing.  The DOJ argued that Zhao could afford to lose the $15 million he put in a trust account and $5 million his guarantors put up. Zhao's attorneys said this argument ignores the financial commitment he and Binance made. Other DOJ arguments similarly ignore everything Zhao has already done, they said, such as flying to the U.S. to begin with.  ""Against the weight of all this information and Judge Tsuchida consideration of it, the government provides no meritorious – or additional – basis to insist that Mr. Zhao remain in the United States away from his family for months between his plea and sentencing,"" the filing said.  Zhao's sentencing is currently scheduled for Feb. 23, 2024. He faces a potential 18-month prison term and agreed to pay a $50 million fine in his plea agreement.

20661787,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562353,1700866815,"Crypto Market Cap Soars: $1.5 Trillion Milestone Achieved, Bitcoin Sets New Record","Bitcoin (BTC) and the cryptocurrency market have seen a significant uptrend, hitting a new annual high and surpassing $1.45 trillion, paving the way for potential gains in the final days of November. Notably, BTC, the largest cryptocurrency in the market, has achieved a remarkable milestone, approaching the $40,000 level with a price surge to $38,400. The catalysts behind this recent surge include the anticipated acceptance of the BlackRock Bitcoin Spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) within the next 45 days and speculation that BlackRock itself may influence Bitcoin’s price through significant buying pressure on Coinbase. BlackRock Driving BTC’s Recent Price Surge? According to CoinGecko, the global cryptocurrency market cap currently stands at $1.5 trillion, reflecting a 2.05% change in the last 24 hours and an impressive 72.26% change compared to the same period last year. This surge in market capitalization has not only boosted Bitcoin but has also contributed to gains in other major cryptocurrencies within the Top 100, such as Blur (BLUR), which soared a staggering 27%, Mina Protocol (MINA), which gained 9%, and Bittensor (TAO), which has seen a 14% surge in the last 24 hours, to name a few. Related Reading: Big Money Returns To Dogecoin: Rally To $0.2 Already Programmed? Regarding the recent surge of BTC to a new yearly high, crypto expert known by the pseudonym “Crypto Rover” has shed light on potential catalysts driving the recent surge. According to Rover, the BlackRock Bitcoin Spot ETF launch is expected to occur within the next 45 days. In this regard, Rover’s analysis suggests that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, may play a role in Bitcoin’s recent surge. The speculation is based on the observation that a significant amount of Bitcoin buying pressure appears to be coming from Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, with the platform serving as BlackRock’s custodial partner. Promising Bitcoin Price Targets For Late 2025 Renowned crypto analyst Crypto Con has unveiled what he claims to be the most accurate Log Regression Curves for Bitcoin to date. These curves have provided insights into the future cycle top, an elusive aspect of Bitcoin analysis. According to projections derived from the curve matching technique, late 2025 could witness two potential price targets for Bitcoin: $130,000, referred to as Layer 6, and Layer 7, with a target price of $180,000. The analyst says several models and projections support the $130,000 target, adding to its credibility. According to Crypto Con, even the most conservative estimate, known as Layer 5 at $94,000, seems less likely. Based on historical trends, it is improbable that the entire red band, representing potential price ranges, would fail during this cycle. Therefore, one of the projected targets is expected to be accurate. Related Reading: Ripple CEO Offers Perspective On Legal Fallout With The SEC Based on the available information, Crypto Con favors layer 6 at $130,000 as the more likely target for Bitcoin’s late 2025 price surge. This projection aligns with the Halving Cycles Theory, suggesting a timeframe of approximately 21 days from November 28th, 2025. Bitcoin has undergone a recent pullback within the last hour following its attainment of a new yearly high. As of now, it is trading at $37,800.

Valour XRP ETP To Enter European Markets Valour, a publicly traded company backed by DeFi Technologies, a crypto-based software organization, has announced a new XRP Exchange Traded Product (ETP). In a press release published on Wednesday, DeFi Technologies disclosed the launch of Valour’s XRP ETP in December 2023. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Community Project Calls Out Founders For Refusing To Burn 103 Trillion SHIB A popular YouTuber, Zack Rector has stated in a recent YouTube video that the token is positioned to take advantage of a large flow of liquidity driven by the initiation of multiple XRP ETPs. Including Valour’s ETP, there have been many other ETPs launched by industry-leading crypto companies. 21 Shares, a Swiss financial institution, is one of the prominent companies that issued its XRP ETP (AXRP) in 2019. Since its launch, AXRP has recorded approximately $49 million in assets under its control and the ETP earns a year-to-date return of +69%. Rector disclosed that the growing number of ETPs could trigger significant institutional inflows that could push the adoption of the token and possibly drive its price upwards. Furthermore, the integration of an XRP ETP has the potential to significantly advance the ecosystem by enhancing liquidity and improving accessibility for retail and institutional investors. ETP Influence On The Price The announcement of Valour’s XRP ETP comes as a positive development for the community and the broader crypto space. Various crypto investors have expressed their optimism about the significant impacts these ETPs could have on the XRP market. Just as the news of Spot Bitcoin ETF applications propelled Bitcoin’s price above $37,000, institutional flows from Valour’s XRP ETP could drive the token’s price to $10. Related Reading: Analyst Says Ethereum Is Seeing ‘Systemic Buying’, What This Means The ETP issued by 21 Shares Ripple is a prime example of how XRP ETPs have performed in the past. After being traded 447 times on the market, this particular ETP generated $5 million in revenue. Valour’s upcoming ETP has become a focal point for investors seeking strategic investment opportunities. Crypto investors are closely monitoring the market to assess the potential gains that may follow the ETP’s debut. The anticipated launch of Ripple’s IPO and the final resolution of the lawsuit between Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are also major events that could help drive the price of the token to higher levels.

20658263,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562358,1700859617,Ethereum Outperforms Bitcoin: Is The Altcoin Season Officially On?,"Ethereum (ETH) continues to absorb Bitcoin (BTC) selling pressure in November, looking at price action when writing on November 24. In the daily chart, ETH bulls have the upper hand, adding roughly 9% versus BTC from October lows. Ethereum Outperforms Bitcoin In November ETH buyers are firm, with price action still confined inside the conspicuous bullish engulfing bar of November 9. Despite bears forcing prices lower in the second week of November, the failure of BTC bulls to reverse all losses suggests that ETH buyers are still in command. If anything, prices may rise in the days ahead, reversing losses of the better part of 2022 when Bitcoin, buoyed by a crash in the altcoin scene, forced capital to the world’s most valuable currency. With Ethereum being resilient, reading from its performance in the ETH/BTC chart, hints suggest that the altcoin season could be in the early stages. Should that be the case, it will be a reprieve for ETH and other altcoins, including Cardano (ADA). Related Reading: Will Recent Binance Events Trigger This Historical Bitcoin Bull Run Signal? Following the dip in 2022, most altcoins capitulated, with most falling by over 80% from 2021 peaks as the crypto winter progressed, freezing gains. The situation took a turn south in 2023 when regulators continued with their enforcement actions against CeFi facilitators, mostly exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. Their decision negatively impacted liquidity, as evidenced in other trending altcoins like Solana (SOL). ETH remains relatively firm at spot rates versus BTC, extending gains in late November. This could indicate that demand is beginning to pivot toward altcoins, with ETH, the most liquid of them all, leading the way. Since other altcoins have relatively thinner liquidity, they tend to recover faster but generally align with ETH. If the ETH revival is sustained, reading from the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart, the leg up might also be accelerated by several macro tailwinds. BlackRock Applies For Spot Ethereum ETF, Will ETH Reach $26,800? In November, BlackRock, one of the world’s largest asset managers, filed for a spot Ethereum ETF. It comes when the broader crypto market expects the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve the first spot Bitcoin ETF in the country. This application signals that BlackRock is confident about Ethereum’s investment products. Related Reading: Market Watch: These 5 Altcoins Are Poised For Breakouts, Says Crypto Expert Additionally, the on-chain analytics platform, Token Terminal, recently issued a bold report forecasting ETH to reach $36,800 by 2030. Token Terminal expects Ethereum to process over $14 trillion of the finance industry’s value in the next seven years. Ethereum would likely dominate at this pace, driven by sharp growth in decentralized finance (DeFi) and other crypto sub-sectors.

20657880,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4654059-cleanspark-buy-before-april-2024-bitcoin-halving?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,1700858793,CleanSpark: Buy Before The April 2024 Bitcoin Halving,"Summary CleanSpark is an undervalued Bitcoin mining company that has outperformed the S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100 in 2023. The company has achieved key milestones, including record revenue and record Bitcoin holdings. CleanSpark has significant upside potential due to the upcoming Bitcoin halving event and potential price increases. CleanSpark ( CLSK ) is the 2nd Bitcoin (BTC-USD) mining company that I plan to hold over the long term because I believe CLSK stock is quite undervalued at current price levels. CLSK shares are up 138% YTD and have greatly outperformed both the S&P 500 ( SPY ) and NASDAQ 100 ( QQQ ) by a wide margin. Data by YCharts Many of my followers are well aware of my bullish stance on Marathon Digital Holdings ( MARA ), which I covered here in one of my past articles. CleanSpark benefits from a lot of the same tailwinds since the company operates in the same industry. However, CleanSpark has been aggressively stacked Bitcoin over the last few months while Marathon Digital has reduced its Bitcoin holdings. Led by Co-founder and CEO Zachary Bradford, CleanSpark is another founder-led crypto company that could surprise investors during the upcoming crypto bull run. CLSK Company Overview (cleanspark.com) CleanSpark Company Overview (cleanspark.com) The company owns 100% of its Bitcoin mining facilities in Georgia plus co-owns another facility in New York. It's possible that Bitcoin mining stocks could experience a near-term selloff due to the massive Bitcoin spot ETF runup. If this happens then that would make CLSK shares even more attractive in my opinion. CleanSpark Q3 2023 Business Update CleanSpark achieved some key milestones in Q3 2023 as the company plans to expand its Bitcoin mining hash rate to 16 EH/s over the next few quarters. The company hit record revenue of $45.5 million (Up 47% YoY) while tripling its hash rate year over year to 9 EH/s. Net losses were $14.2 million in Q3 2023 compared to $29.3 million in Q3 2023, which means CleanSpark should become profitable again as early as Q2 2024 due to the upcoming Bitcoin halving event. CleanSpark finished Q3 2023 with 1,200 BTC on its balance sheet and $90 million in cash on hand. What's interesting is that CleanSpark, along with most BTC miners, provides monthly updates on its mining operations. As of October 31st 2023 , CleanSpark mined 633 BTC on October 2023 and increased its BTC stack to 2,311. The company surpassed the 10 EH/s milestone with almost 89,000 operational Bitcoin miners deployed. CLSK October 2023 Update (cleanspark.com) These are impressive numbers considering CleanSpark shares trade under $5 as I write this at a sub $1 billion market cap. Why I'm Bullish on CleanSpark Stock Investors misunderstand the potential of the Bitcoin mining industry because it's a relatively small sector that doesn't have a lot of invested capital. Marathon Digital ( MARA ) is the largest publicly traded Bitcoin mining company with a $2 billion market cap. It's understandable that small-cap companies get ignored by larger, more profitable companies such as Nvidia ( NVDA ) or Tesla ( TSLA ). However, that's exactly why I'm bullish on companies such as CleanSpark due to its massive upside potential at a relatively low valuation. CleanSpark mined 633 BTC in October at around 10 EH/s. If the company scales production to 16 EH/s then I expect mining production to increase around 60% to ~1,000 BTC mined per month. At current Bitcoin prices, CleanSpark could generate around $37,000,000 million in monthly revenue or just over $100 million per quarter. Many Bitcoin experts predict the price of Bitcoin to skyrocket after the April 2024 Bitcoin halving due to a supply shock when the amount of mineable BTC per block decreases from 6.25 to 3.125 every 10 minutes. That's where things could get interesting for CleanSpark if Bitcoin price soars over the next 12 to 24 months. The April 2024 Bitcoin Halving Catalyst The Bitcoin Halving event is the most important catalyst for Bitcoin's price because it occurs once every 4 years and cuts the amount of daily released Bitcoin in half. The current BTC block reward is 6.25 but BTC miners like CleanSpark will receive 3.125 BTC per block after April 2024. While I expect CleanSpark to mine fewer BTC moving forward, the company will benefit from higher BTC prices along with transaction fees and Ordinal fees. For example, someone paid over $3 million (83.65 BTC) in transaction fees to send 128 BTC on November 23rd, 2023. The miner, AntPool, received the 83 BTC block reward for processing the transaction. This is a good example of how higher transaction fees will offset the decreasing BTC block reward for CleanSpark and other miners in the future. I previously mentioned that CleanSpark could scale to ~3,000 BTC mined per quarter in the near future, which would translate into ~$100 million in quarterly revenue at Bitcoin's current price levels. My Bitcoin Price prediction for 2025 is around $370,000 per coin, which is around 10x from current price levels. Assuming CleanSpark's BTC production remains steady over the next two years, the company could generate as much as $1 billion per quarter in mining revenue. CleanSpark's 2025 annual revenue could approach $4 billion annually during the peak of the bull market, which makes CLSK stock look extremely cheap at current price levels. Using CLSK's current Price-to-sales ratio of 2.65, I'm projecting a future market cap of around $8 to $10 billion at the height of the crypto bull run in the Summer of 2025. That would send CLSK shares to around $48 to $60 if my prediction comes true. Risk Factors Decreasing Bitcoin Prices: Crypto mining stocks are positively correlated to Bitcoin prices, which means a BTC price crash would hurt CLSK shares in the near term. Lack of Capital to Fund Hashrate Growth : CleanSpark finished Q3 2023 with $125 million in cash on hand and may need to conserve some capital just in case Bitcoin's price crashes over the next few months. Selling Bitcoin to Fund Growth: CleanSpark sells ~88% of its monthly mined BTC to cover expenses but that could increase if the company wants to grow its hash rate faster. Rising Short Interest : CLSK's short interest is ~8% but that number could increase if short sellers bet heavily against the stock. I don't think this is a major risk since short sellers have lost a ton of money betting against Bitcoin and crypto stocks in 2023 due to Bitcoin's 125% YTD gains. My Gameplan for CLSK Stock I'm long CLSK shares and will continue buying the stock leading up to the April 2024 Bitcoin halving. My goal is to accumulate shares and then sell covered calls to pay myself a small ""dividend"" while I wait for the bull run to start after the April 2024 halving. Right now, the Daily RSI chart for CLSK is around 62 while the weekly RSI chart is just 58. Long-term resistance is around $7.50 while support sits around $3.40. CLSK Daily RSI Chart (cleanspark.com) CLSK Weekly RSI Chart (cleanspark.com) CLSK stock may dip in the next few weeks but should continue rising over the next few quarters if crypto bulls continue to smash the buy button. The crypto bull run won't last forever and usually ends ~500 days after the Bitcoin halving event. That means CLSK shares could peak around September 2025. If you're looking for a relatively cheap crypto penny stock with lots of upside then CleanSpark is one of the best Bitcoin mining stocks in my opinion.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4654059-cleanspark-buy-before-april-2024-bitcoin-halving?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/20657880.jpeg

20656441,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562309,1700856020,"Ethereum Conquers $2,100: On-Chain Data Paints Path To $2,400","Ethereum has cleared the $2,100 level during the past day, and if on-chain data is anything to go by, a rally to new yearly highs should be “easy.” Ethereum Has No Major On-Chain Resistance At Higher Levels An analyst in a post on X explained that Ethereum has overcome a major on-chain resistance zone with its recent price rally. The on-chain resistance and support levels are defined based on the density of investors who bought at them. The reason behind this lies in how investor psychology tends to work. For any investor, their cost basis is an important level, so whenever the price retests, they pay special attention and might be tempted to make some kind of move. Related Reading: Is Dogecoin About To Reverse? Key Factors To Watch A holder who had been at a loss before the retest might lean towards selling, as they may fear the cryptocurrency would dip below it again, so exiting at the break-even would at least mean they would avoid losses. Similarly, an investor might decide to accumulate more if they had been in profits earlier, as they would see this same level as a profitable point of entry into the asset. Now, here is a chart that shows how the Ethereum price ranges around the current price are looking in terms of the density of investors who share their cost basis there: Looks like the levels above don't host the cost basis of that many investors | Source: @ali_charts on X As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum price range between $1,982 and $2,044 hosts the cost basis of about 1.67 million addresses, which acquired 38.73 million ETH at these levels. Naturally, the more investors that share their cost basis inside a specific range, the stronger the reaction that the price would feel when it retests due to the aforementioned buying/selling effects. Thus, this range that’s thick with investors would be a significant zone for the cryptocurrency. Since Ethereum has already surged past this area and has gained some distance over it with its latest break, the range is likely to play the role of support now. Related Reading: Will Recent Binance Events Trigger This Historical Bitcoin Bull Run Signal? Ethereum has this strong support area under its belt, while at the same time, there are no major resistance zones immediately above, as is apparent from the chart. This ideal setup means that, in theory, ETH shouldn’t have much trouble rallying towards the $2,426 level. Another analyst has also pointed out how Ethereum has observed negative exchange netflows since the start of the month. The exchange netflow here is an indicator that keeps track of the net amount of ETH exiting or entering the wallets of all centralized exchanges. The indicator's value has been negative recently | Source: @C__thumbs on X The net outflows have amounted to over $1 billion during this period, a potential sign that significant buying has been occurring in the space. This certainly fuels the idea that ETH could explore new yearly highs shortly. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $2,100, up 9% in the past week.

Token Terminal Predicts When This Will Happen","Blockchain analytics platform Token Terminal has provided insight into the future trajectory of the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum (ETH). Interestingly, they predict that the crypto token could rise as high as $36,800. When Ethereum Will Hit $36,800 In the research paper released by the platform, Ethereum is billed to hit the $36,800 mark by 2030. However, this prediction is made in the best-case scenario of 2030 being a bull market season. One of the ways in which they analyzed ETH’s future value was with the total Addressable Market analysis. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Community Project Calls Out Founders For Refusing To Burn 103 Trillion SHIB They looked at the industries already adopting blockchains while forecasting how much of them will move on-chain by 2030. In line with this, they considered the role Ethereum could play in this in terms of tokenization. Token Terminal believes that all assets could be tokenized on the network, playing an integral role in the finance industry. The finance industry apparently does over $28 trillion in annual revenues at the moment and is growing at a compound annual rate of 7.5%. With this in mind, Token Terminal foresees that the finance industry and Ethereum could form a mutually beneficial relationship. For one, a majority of the liquidity in the industry could become consolidated on the Ethereum network. Source: Token Terminal Alongside the prediction of $36,800 in 2030, the blockchain analytics platform projects that Ethereum could also enjoy an 80% market share among Layer 1 networks. The network could reach a monthly revenue of $109,668 in the best-case scenario (dependent on 2030 being a bull year). Ethereum’s Price In The Next Bull Cycle Meanwhile, Token Terminal also gave an insight into what Ethereum’s price could look like in the next bull run. According to the platform, the crypto token could rise to as high as $13,000 at the peak of the bull market. From their projection, the Bitcoin Halving is seen as a catalyst that could spark the next cycle. Related Reading: Analyst Says Ethereum Is Seeing ‘Systemic Buying’, What This Means Source: Token Terminal The next Bitcoin Halving is expected to take place on April 4, 2024. Based on Token Terminal’s analysis, Ethereum’s price could rise to $2,300 by then. From that moment, ETH is projected to see an increase of over 469% as it surges to over $13,000 at the peak of the next bull cycle. The future of Ethereum looks really promising based on these forecasts. Above all, Token Terminal expects the network to continue to dominate its competitors in terms of the economic opportunity on it. They predict that new use cases on Ethereum will spur it to “grow exponentially larger” in the coming years.

20652859,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562308,1700848819,"Market Watch: These 5 Altcoins Are Poised For Breakouts, Says Crypto Expert","A recent analysis by a Crypto Banter pinpointed new notable price levels for prominent altcoins such as XRP, Solana (SOL), Chainlink (LINK), Fantom (FTM), and Polygon (MATIC). These insights provide a fresh perspective on potential entry points for bullish positions in the current market. Related Reading: Whale Alert: Big Players Scoop Up These 4 Altcoins, On-Chain Data Indicates Altcoins At Crossroads: Key Price Levels To Watch In this analysis, Crypto Banter singles out Solana (SOL) and notes that $48 is an “intriguing” level to watch for any pullback. Additionally, historical data consolidating around this price point on the SOL/USD weekly chart indicates it could be an “optimal” buying zone should prices drop to this mark. In the case of Chainlink (LINK), Crypto Banter identifies $13.3 down to $12.2 as a “hot zone.” A drop below this range might shift focus to the $9 level as a critical reversal point. Polygon (MATIC) also comes under scrutiny, with the analyst observing a break in the 200-day moving average on its weekly chart timeframe. According to the host, this development suggests a potential bounce back at the $0.68 zone, possibly preluding a rally. For clarity, “moving average,” or MA, is a widely used indicator in technical analysis that helps unravel price data by creating a constantly updated average price. This average is typically calculated over a specific period, like 10 days, 20 minutes, 30 weeks; in the case of the Crypto Banter analysis, they based their analysis on the 200-day MA. Fantom’s Surge And XRP’s Pivotal Turnaround On the other hand, Fantom (FTM), Crypto Banter, revealed that the altcoin has shown a significant pump of over 50% since late October. Yet, the analyst suggests a possible retraction towards the 200-day moving average, making the $0.25 region attractive, particularly for those employing a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy. XRP is not left out of this analytical purview. The host points out that XRP is nearing a critical juncture from a technical standpoint. The analyst reveals that the 12-hour chart for XRP shows a recent rebound off the 50-day MA. A turnaround around the $0.54 price region could occur if the ongoing pattern along the downward trendline persists. The analyst further disclosed that this level gains importance due to the convergence of key moving averages that form a support zone around it. Related Reading: 3 Altcoins Set To Skyrocket In Next Crypto Bull Run, According To Analyst Interestingly, among the altcoins highlighted by Crypto Banter as primed for a breakout, SOL and FTM stand out with significant gains. Over the past two weeks, Solana has seen a 13.8% increase, while FTM has climbed by 8.3%. Contrastingly, XRP, LINK, and MATIC have experienced declines during the same period. XRP’s price fell by 5.5%, LINK by 5.6%, and MATIC by 6.6%, signaling a diverse performance landscape among these notable altcoins.

The firms said in a statement that the move is part of their ""commitment to transparency,"" although opposition doesn't mean a complete release of all of its documents. ""However, it's essential to clarify that transparency does not mean a wholesale release of all our documents. This approach is not in line with standard business practices,"" the statement said.  Tether previously made a similar announcement after losing in court twice when attempting to block a June 2021 FOIL request filed by CoinDesk. That request pertained to documents produced during the New York Attorney General's inquiry on allegations that USDT, the U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin that Tether issues, was not sufficiently backed by reserves from mid-2019 to early 2021, settling charges with the company at the end of that period.  Read more: Tether’s Banking Relationships, Commercial Paper Exposure Detailed in Newly Released Legal Documents  In the FOIL request, CoinDesk specifically asked for documents about Tether's reserves. The stablecoin issuer petitioned the New York Supreme Court to block the release of these documents. CoinDesk joined the case to argue for releasing the documents in the public interest. Tether opposed CoinDesk's involvement, which a New York judge dismissed.  In Friday's statement, the companies said that they won't appeal against the FOIL request by some journalists but remain ""open to constructive engagement with journalists and regulatory authorities who adhere to ethical reporting standards and respect data privacy boundaries.""  USDT is the world's largest stablecoin, currently worth about $88.5 billion. It serves as a critical infrastructure in the crypto ecosystem that facilitates the movement of money around the globe.  In his book, Faux noted the use of USDT in various illicit activities, including ""pig butchering"" scams.

The fund has traded at a discount since February 2021 and hit record lows of nearly 50% in December last year.  Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said in a social media post on X (formerly Twitter) that the narrowing is likely prompted by Grayscale's ""updated filings/SEC meeting reported Wed.""

20651050,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562279,1700845249,Will Recent Binance Events Trigger This Historical Bitcoin Bull Run Signal?,"The recent events at cryptocurrency exchange Binance could trigger the next Bitcoin bull run if this pattern continues to form. Will Bitcoin Exchange Reserve Ratio Turn Around After Binance News? As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the BTC exchange reserve ratio for US versus off-shore platforms has followed a specific pattern during past bull markets of the asset. The “exchange reserve ratio” here refers to an indicator that compares the exchange reserves of any two platforms or group of platforms. The exchange reserve is the total amount of Bitcoin sitting in the wallets of the exchange/group in question. In the context of the current discussion, the exchange reserve ratio between the US-based exchanges and foreign platforms is of interest. The trend in this metric can tell us about which type of exchanges users prefer to use. Related Reading: Is Dogecoin About To Reverse? Key Factors To Watch When the ratio’s value declines, the off-shore exchanges gain steam as investors deposit their coins to them faster than to the US platforms (alternatively, they are withdrawing at a slower pace). On the other hand, an increase implies the dominance of the American exchanges is going up as their exchange reserve is growing relative to that of the global platforms. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin exchange reserve ratio for these two sets of exchanges over the last few years: Looks like the value of the metric has been going up in recent weeks | Source: CryptoQuant In the graph, the quant has highlighted the two phases that the Bitcoin exchange reserve ratio for these platforms appeared to have followed during the last two bull runs. In the first phase (marked in green), the indicator rises while the cryptocurrency goes through a buildup period for the bull rally. This suggests that large entities start participating in the American exchanges ahead of the bull run. Once the bull run starts properly, the indicator’s value starts sliding down as investors withdraw their coins from these platforms again (the red box in the graph). From the chart, it’s visible that the Bitcoin exchange reserve ratio for US vs. foreign exchanges was in a continued decline since the start of the bear market but has recently shown signs of turning around. The indicator has only registered a small increase so far, so it’s hard to say if it’s a sign of a trend taking shape or just a temporary deviation. Whatever the case, though, a development has happened in the Bitcoin market that can tip the favor towards the American platforms regardless. Related Reading: Chainlink Retests $14: Here’s What Will Happen If Support Holds Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange based on trading volume, has seen a leadership change following Changpeng Zhao’s resignation. The instability has kickstarted outflows from the exchange, while US-based Coinbase has enjoyed inflows. Thus, this may be the event that leads to a proper reversal in the BTC exchange reserve ratio. “If the recent regulations on CZ and Binance lead to an increase in the percentage of Bitcoin held on US exchanges, we will be ready for the next bull market,” notes the analyst.

42409368,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcGrMO,1700844071,NFT Platform Blur's Token Jumps 22% Amid Binance Listing and Blast Optimism,"BLUR, the native token of non-fungible token (NFT) platform Blur, surged by 22% on Friday after being listed on Binance's convert feature.  The convert feature is aimed at Binance's retail customers. It allows customers to buy and sell assets without going through a traditional order book.  The token rose from $0.55 to as high as $0.64 after the listing, compounding an uptrend that has seen its value double in the past week, according to CoinMarketCap.  Friday's move comes alongside bitcoin [BTC] hitting its highest point since May 2022 as the broader cryptocurrency market continues its rally.  Blur has performed particularly well following the launch of Blast, a layer 2 network developed by the same people who built Blur.  After going live earlier this week, Blast has received over $400 million in deposits and will issue an airdrop in May.  Trading volume on BLUR trading pairs is just shy of $1 billion over the past 24 hours as speculators attempt to cash in on the hype surrounding Blast.  Blast has received criticism from some parts of the crypto community for its referral scheme, which some say resembles a pyramid scheme.

Just like the rest of the crypto market, the LOOKS has since succumbed to the bearish headwinds, losing over 98% of its bull market highs. However, this might not continue for long as one crypto analyst has predicted a massive burst that could send the price toward its previous highs. LOOKS Poised For Parabolic Move In an analysis posted on TradingView, a crypto analyst that goes by without_worries on the platform has predicted a meteoric price rise for the LOOKS token. The analysis identifies major indicators that have turned bullish, pointing to a 10000% increase in price. Related Reading: Analyst Says Ethereum Is Seeing ‘Systemic Buying’, What This Means First, the analyst notes that the price action and the RSI resistance breakouts point to a potential bull rally. Then there is also the fact that multiple oscillators have turned toward a positive divergence with the price action that has been recorded. As the analyst explains, this positive divergence continues to get stronger with a move up in the timeframe. The third factor that points toward this rally is the panic in the crypto market. Volume has been on the rise as investors scrambled to get back in the market and take advantage of the rising prices. “Every sell off is met with a large volume increase,” the analyst states. Source: Tradingview.com A falling wedge pattern that uses the highest to the lowest touch points also supports this theory of a breakout. So while it is likely that the price could keep falling, there is a higher chance that it will begin to climb, the analyst explains. Furthermore, the analyst identifies the fact that LOOKS is yet to be listed on major exchanges such as Binance. As such, this provides a unique opportunity to get into the coin before it gets on investors’ radars. LooksRare Recovery To New Highs The analysis which was first posted on November 22 put one of the price targets just above the $5.2 level, which would be an initial 5,000% move from the $0.097 price mark at the time. Related Reading: FTX’s FTT Token Leads Market Gains With 55% Rally, What’s Driving It? However, given the analyst’s 10,000% increase prediction, there is the expectation that the altcoin will cross its previous all-time high price of $7. Completing a 10,000% move from here would see the price rise to $9 which would be a new all-time high price. A breakout seems to have already begun for the LOOKS price by Friday. The price is already over 23% up and continues to show bullish tendencies. However, there is no timeframe presented by the analyst for when this 10000% move would be completed.

Ripple CEO Insights On The SEC’s Stand In The Legal Battle The Ripple CEO spoke about the case between the crypto company and the SEC in an interview at the 2023 DC Tech Week. Garlinghouse highlighted the SEC’s several setbacks since the case started. According to the CEO, “the SEC has lost on everything that matters” when he was asked if the case is “done and dusted.” He further highlighted that the case’s conclusion rests on the SEC’s decision to pursue an appeal or not. Related Reading: Ripple Introduces AMMs To XRPL, But Is This Good Or Bad For XRP Price Nonetheless, Garlinghouse asserted that whether or not the SEC files an appeal on the case, which seems over for the regulator. This is due to the SEC’s “losing about three times to the crypto firm.” In addition, the CEO also brought up the SEC’s losses in the Grayscale case. In a court ruling, a trial judge declared the agency was behaving “arbitrarily and capriciously” towards Grayscales’s Spot Bitcoin ETF application. Notably, this legal wording suggests intentional and unreasonable activities done carelessly, ignoring relevant circumstances, facts, and other parties’ rights. With this incident, Garlinghouse emphasized that the SEC should reevaluate its course toward cryptocurrency regulation. The CEO stated: I mean this is damning language from a federal judge to the SEC. At some point when you keep trying the same thing and having the same outcome, you need to change your approach. I hope the SEC’s change will be magical. Nonetheless, Garlinghouse noted that the SEC losses will be amplified if they decide to take the appeal process higher. Furthermore, Garlinghouse “reaffirmed” that Ripple stands prepared to pursue the matter further with the US Supreme Court should the situation demand it. Given that the Supreme Court has typically ruled against regulators, he firmly believes that the SEC would fail in the Supreme Court. Regulatory Framework For the Cryptocurrency Industry The Ripple CEO also spoke about the ambiguous regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency industry in the United States. According to Garlinghouse, other nations are increasing their market influence by implementing open rules and luring capital into the industry. On the other hand, the US continues to view cryptocurrencies with “skepticism.” Related Reading: Ripple CEO Declares Intent To Bring XRP Battle To Supreme Court Garlinghouse conveyed that the US lacks a conducive regulatory framework. This causes the United States to “forfeit” its prospective position as a leader in the cryptocurrency space. So far, the Ripple CEO believes the US will create a crypto-friendly legal environment in the next ten years.

20645939,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562273,1700834445,"XRP Price Could Hit $10,000 If It Overtakes SWIFT, Pundit Suggests","Edward Farina, Head of Social Adoption at XRP Healthcare, recently proposed a scenario where the price of XRP could potentially surge to $10,000. His projection is based on the possibility of the token as a bridge currency and RippleNet replacing SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) in the global cross-border payment systems. Could XRP Price Reach $10,000? Farina’s commentary dives into the principles of market dynamics. He argues against common misconceptions about the cryptocurrency’s potential growth. “Few people seem to understand the principle of supply and demand. I always see people being shocked when they see someone saying that XRP can reach $10k. (Not saying it necessarily will.),” Farina remarked. Related Reading: Pro-XRP Lawyer Deaton Picks His Top 10 Cryptos For The Year Ahead He emphasizes that the global financial sector’s movement of hundreds of trillions of dollars annually means even a small market share could lead to a significant surge in its valuation. Farina also elaborates on the current capabilities of the SWIFT system, handling billions of transactions per hour, and the impact of RippleNet potentially replacing it. “The problem with the way most people view XRP’s potential to grow exponentially, is that they think it can’t reach that high of a market cap. They’re failing to realize that Financial Institutions move hundreds of trillions worldwide. If XRP captures a tiny fraction of that, it will catapult XRP to unprecedented levels,” he explains. This highlights the vast, untapped market that XRP could penetrate. However, Farina does not provide exact figures, nor does he explain how much capital would have to flow into the cryptocurrency to reach the price of $10,000. Related Reading: XRP On The Verge Of A Surge: Analyst Pinpoints Next Bullish Targets Besides that, Farina underscores XRP’s supposed technological superiority, particularly in terms of transaction speed and finality. “XRP settles value in real time (an average of 3 seconds) and with finality. BTC cannot do that, neither ETH nor SWIFT. Period,” he asserts, making a case for the tokens’ efficiency and reliability over existing systems. Can Ripple Replace SWIFT? The discussion about whether XRP can reach a four- or five-digit price if Ripple replaces SWIFT or only a part of it is almost as old as the token itself. It was only recently that influencer Crypto Eri unearthed a five-year-old statement from Ripple CTO David Schwartz. Schwartz outlined the positive correlation between an asset’s price and its liquidity. “Higher prices tend to correlate with higher liquidity, which means cheaper payments,” he noted, explaining that as the tokens’ value increases, it becomes a more viable medium for large-scale financial transfers. This ties back to Farina’s vision of the cryptocurrency disrupting the current financial systems. Grayscale has also recently confirmed XRP’s potential to compete with SWIFT. In its latest “Currencies Crypto Sector” report, the company writes, “Beyond Bitcoin, XRP is the second largest asset. Designed as an alternative to SWIFT, XRP aims to offer fast cross-border payments at lower transaction costs than competitors.” At press time, XRP traded at $0.6208.

42409376,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcGrmq,1700831956,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Touches $38K on Quiet Holiday Weekend,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin briefly touched $38,000 on Friday morning for the first time since May 2022 amid quiet trading in traditional markets on the day after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. The cryptocurrency has since retreated slightly, but remains 1.5% up on the day, with some observers predicting it will climb higher in the short term. Trader Michael Van Pope said in a tweet that the next price point for bitcoin is $40,000. “Slowly grinding upwards to a new resistance point and a break above $38K immediately means $40K is next,” he wrote. Ether added almost 2% on the day to trade at around $2,100.  A significant number of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares have been bought in the secondary market this year at a deep discount to net asset value in anticipation the trust’s conversion to an exchange-traded fund (ETF) will be approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), JPMorgan said in a research report Thursday. The bank estimates a net $2.5 billion has flowed into GBTC since the start of the year, increasing to $2.7 billion if adding the covering of short interest. “Assuming this buying flow was mostly speculative in anticipation of GBTC being converted to an ETF, then it is likely that this $2.7b would come out of GBTC as these investors take profit once GBTC gets converted,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.  A court in Podgorica, the capital of Montenegro, approved the extradition of Terra founder Do Kwon to either South Korea or the United States, according to an update posted on the judiciary's website. Kwon was arrested in March after being caught in Podgorica's airport with falsified documents. The final decision on the extradition will be made by the Montenegrin justice minister after Kwon serves a four-month prison sentence for document forgery, it said. Following his arrest in Montenegro, Kwon faces multiple counts of fraud charged by U.S. federal prosecutors, in addition to existing civil charges in the U.S. and an investigation in South Korea related to last year's terraUSD collapse.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the share of the U.S. dollar, euro and Chinese yuan in SWIFT transactions since 2010.  The greenback remains the most used currency in financial transactions even as popular narrative suggests de-dollarization has gathered pace.  De-euroization has gathered pace, with the single currency's share falling to the lowest in over 13 years.

42409379,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcGrq9,1700831480,Bitcoin's Hashrate War Between Antpool and Foundry Intensifies as BTC ETF Nears,"Antpool and Foundry dominate Bitcoin mining, and analysts expect intensified competition between China and the U.S. as next year's reward halving approaches.  The halving could spur demand for advanced mining rigs and affect market prices, with miners likely holding on to bitcoin in anticipation of ETF approvals.  Bitcoin miners Antpool and Foundry dominate Bitcoin mining hashrate. Between them, the two own a total of 53.4% of the world's hashing power.  In the past few weeks, Antpool has been pulling ahead of its biggest competitor, adding significant power to its hashing capabilities.  ""China is aggressively mining ahead of the approval of a Bitcoin ETF"", Bradley Park, a Web3 analyst at CryptoQuant, wrote to CoinDesk in a note.  ""As the Bitcoin halving nears, I anticipate a competitive surge between China and the US in mining machine productivity,"" he continued. ""This is because the unit cost of mining Bitcoin is likely to escalate due to increasing power expenses and rising mining difficulty.""  The Bitcoin halving, a significant event in the cryptocurrency's timeline that occurs roughly every four years, reduces the block rewards for miners by 50%, affecting the currency's supply and, potentially, its price (BTC).  While many argue that the halving is bullish for bitcoin's price, some also say a significant bull run is more likely to depend on major central banks increasing their M2 money supply growth rates, as past trends have shown a correlation between these rates and the price.  Lucy Hu, a senior analyst at Metalpha, told CoinDesk that the new peak in mining difficulty, driven by the recent price surge and the halving's proximity, will lead to the dominance of advanced rigs like the Antminer S21, benefiting firms with the latest equipment.  On-chain data from CryptoQuant shows that miner reserves of bitcoin are nearly back to where they were at the start of the year, around 1.84 million BTC. Antpool is the exception: Its reserve has been climbing significantly for most of November.  ""We expect miners would only sell just enough bitcoins to keep the business operating before any bitcoin ETFs are approved or just keep the coins and borrow to pay,"" Hu said. ""The halving event will double the production costs, so it is in the miner’s best interest to get the latest model of machine to lower the cost and earn more market share.""  According to a recent report from Bernstein, bitcoin's fundamentals are at their strongest, the investment firm argued, with it plotting a timeline for the world's largest digital asset to become a major TradFi asset by 2025.  Bitcoin is currently trading above $37,800, according to CoinDesk Indicies data, up 1.7% on-day.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/11/24/antminer-foundry-battle-in-hashrate-war-as-bitcoin-etf-nears,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/14326e80e965d7da2dfb227d93379d0677984bdf-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

20644312,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562261,1700830814,Big Money Returns To Dogecoin: Rally To $0.2 Already Programmed?,"Dogecoin is trading in the green today, which is a reflection of what on-chain data suggests maybe whales looking to propel the crypto to a rally. Recent on-chain data shows that institutional money might be returning to the meme token, as evident by the number of Dogecoin wallets holding large amounts of DOGE tokens. Institutional Interest In Dogecoin Data from the crypto analytics platform IntoTheBlock has reiterated the current bullish sentiment among Dogecoin whales. According to its large transaction metric, the number of DOGE transactions worth $100,000 or more has been on a run since the middle of last month and resumed a spike in the past week. Related Reading: Grayscale Files Updated Spot ETF As Bitcoin Barrels Past $37,000 IntoTheBlock puts the number of transactions worth $100,000 at 1,300 in the past 24 hours and a 7-day high of 1,770. This notable increase indicates a growing interest in DOGE from institutional players and large-scale investors, which brings more stability and less volatility. This large transaction volume has been going on for a while, as an earlier report noted large holders added more than $2 billion into DOGE throughout October and the first week of November. Crypto Analyst Ali Martinez also shared a similar sentiment for the translation of the metric’s data on social media. According to him, the number of huge DOGE transactions has consistently set new highs this month, which might suggest an increased interest in DOGE from institutional players. #Dogecoin | There’s a notable surge in $DOGE transactions exceeding $100,000 in the past month, consistently hitting new highs. This uptick suggests increased interest in #DOGE from institutional players and whales, potentially gearing up for a significant price spike. pic.twitter.com/UpxVkfu9hW — Ali (@ali_charts) November 23, 2023 Is A Spike Imminent? DOGE To $0.2? Large transactions are something to keep an eye on, as they might indicate a significant price spike if they are buy-ins. Similarly, on-chain analytics platform Santiment recently shared an insight into what might be another catalyst for the price of DOGE. Santiment reported that the number of Dogecoin wallets holding over 1 million DOGE has spiked, as 121 new wallets were created in the past month. At the same time, the crypto recently had the largest spike in dormant DOGE activity in June, as massive amounts of older DOGE moved out of stagnant wallets. While this may be a sign of a selloff, Santiment pointed out that this move often signaled a positive momentum. Related Reading: Cardano Forecast: Crypto Analyst Identifies The Event That Could Send ADA Price To $11 🐶 #Altcoins are back in the green today, and data indicates there has been a massive amount of older $DOGE moving out of stagnant wallets today. Keep an eye on this, as well as the fact that 121 new 1M+ #Dogecoin wallets have popped up in the past month. https://t.co/OjXvbTEEf9 pic.twitter.com/zHMyiqBI7c — Santiment (@santimentfeed) November 22, 2023 Despite all the whale buy-ins and large transactions since October, DOGE has struggled to post high gains compared to other altcoins. The crypto is down by 7.8% in the past week, although a 2.17% increase in the past 24 hours shows momentum might be building. A price surge to $0.2 is still in the books for DOGE, and all it needs is a major catalyst. The first hurdle to break would be a strong footing above $0.08. DOGE is trading at $0.0776 at the time of writing. IntoTheBlock puts the number of addresses still waiting for a profit at 557,560. On the other hand, a drop below $0.6 could cast doubt on the weak optimistic outlook. According to crypto analyst Alan Santana, this is poised to change soon, as Dogecoin could break out in the next six months.

The token, listed on several exchanges including Bybit, Crypto.com, Kucoin and Gate.io, added more than 150% to as high as $5.94. Trading volume hit $79 million across all venues since its release, according to CoinMarketCap.  ChainFlip was developed using the Rust coding language and is based on Uniswap's V3 design on the Ethereum blockchain. It describes itself as a “JIT (Just In Time ) automated market maker,” which aims to improve efficiency when trading and reduce slippage. Slippage – the difference between the price a trader expects to pay and the price they actually pay – can occur if there is a lack of liquidity when large orders are executed.  ChainFlip sold 4.5 million of the tokens at $1.83 in August. They started trading Friday at $2.50.  With ChainFlip and other cross-chain swapping platforms there is no need to bridge or wrap assets. Instead, the market makers automatically purchase an asset on a traditional centralized crypto exchange once a trade is made. ChainFlip validators then send the purchased assets to the wallet address the trader provides at the start of the process.  The protocol received praise from decentralized liquidity protocol THORChain, whose developers said on X that it will work with ChainFlip to ""dethrone the centralized gatekeepers of today.""

This abrupt increase in value is directly related to what happened after the Season 2 airdrop. Coincidentally, the price spike also occurred following news of Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao’s resignation. The cryptocurrency market saw a consecutive two-day period of downward trading activity subsequent to the disclosure of legal accusations against Zhao. Today, it seemed to have changed course and exhibited a favorable trend, with a notable increase of over 2.5% in value within the past 24 hours.

Market analysts have reported a significant surge in purchasing activity, wherein a total of 51.3 million BLUR tokens were acquired by 19 entities.

The subsequent airdrop triggered a substantial increase in token ownership, particularly among major stakeholders, signaling a surge in bullish sentiment and highlighting positive prospects for BLUR’s long-term potential. New Yearly High Still In The Cards Notably, experienced investors, possibly foreseeing enduring value, have actively engaged in sizeable BLUR positions, emphasizing a deliberate and informed move in response to the cryptocurrency’s potential. The charts tell a tale of cautious optimism evolving into confidence in BLUR’s future. The consolidation phase hinted at a market awaiting direction, and the subsequent increase in token volume, especially post-airdrop, indicates a shift toward positivity. BLURUSD trading at $0.620 on the 24-hour chart: TradingView.com Though there has been a noticeable rising trend, BLUR has not yet hit a new annual high. Since February, BLUR has been trading below a trend line of declining resistance. The decline reached a low on August 17 at $0.15. After that, the price started to rise, reaching a higher low on October 12. It emerged from the trend line of downward resistance after five days. The trend line had been in place for 245 days at that point. As more investors became aware of the increase in activity, they might have joined the buying momentum that followed the airdrop. This kind of movement is common in the cryptocurrency space, where important transactions and news can cause asset values to fluctuate quickly. Keeping A Close Tab On The Crypto Even after substantial increases, BLUR is still warranting caution in this area. Waiting for confirmation of the bullish crossover could increase the risk-reward scenario for fresh long positions on a recovery off critical support zones, thus letting the RSI reset could be a good strategy.

The bank estimates a net $2.5 billion has flowed into GBTC since the start of the year, increasing to $2.7 billion if adding the covering of short interest.  “Assuming this buying flow was mostly speculative in anticipation of GBTC being converted to an ETF, then it is likely that this $2.7b would come out of GBTC as these investors take profit once GBTC gets converted,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.  “If this $2.7b exits completely the bitcoin space then such an outflow would of course put severe downward pressure on bitcoin prices,” the authors wrote. “If instead most of this $2.7b shift into other bitcoin instruments such as the newly created spot bitcoin ETFs post SEC approval, which is our best guess, then any negative market impact would be more modest.”  Still, the “balance of risks for bitcoin prices is skewed to the downside in our opinion as some of this $2.7b is likely to completely exit the bitcoin space,” the bank said.  Much more than $2.7 billion could leave GBTC if its fee is not lowered aggressively after conversion into an ETF, the report added.

For the wider market, the exchange's deal “would see significant reduction of a potential systemic risk emanating from a hypothetical Binance collapse,” the report said. It also reinforces an “ongoing shift towards regulated crypto entities and instruments which has been the objective of U.S. authorities post FTX’s collapse,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.  This shift toward regulated crypto companies and products is positive as more regulation will help attract investors from traditional finance, the note said, adding that the involvement of large asset managers such as Blackrock (BLK) and Fidelity in the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) supports this thesis.  The agreement also reduces the uncertainty surrounding the crypto exchange, which will benefit its trading and BNB Smart Chain businesses, JPMorgan said. It noted that Binance had been losing market share due to uncertainty around this issue.  “Its market share loss should be contained going forward and perhaps partly reverse once the implications from the settlement on Binance’s operations and business model become more clear,” the analysts wrote.

20637713,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562253,1700818803,Shiba Inu Community Project Calls Out Founders For Refusing To Burn 103 Trillion SHIB,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) burn tracker, Shibburn, has called out the creator of the meme coin, who goes by the pseudonym “Ryoshi”. The community project seemed to suggest that Ryoshi wasn’t acting in the best interest of the SHIB ecosystem. How “Ryoshi” Has Hampered SHIB’s Burn Rate In a series of posts on their X (formerly Twitter) platform, Shibburn alleged that the founders of the token haven’t always been honest in their dealings. Specifically, the platform suggested that the founders have forestalled the token’s burn rate by refusing to burn over 103 trillion SHIB. This particular allegation stemmed from their statement about Ryoshi’s SHIB holdings. Related Reading: FTX’s FTT Token Leads Market Gains With 55% Rally, What’s Driving It? Shibburn mentioned that Ryoshi lied about how much SHIB they held. They stated how the SHIB founder had, in their own words, claimed to hold “0 SHIB” as doing otherwise could bring about a conflict of interest. Meanwhile, that turned out to be a lie, as Ryoshi apparently holds over $1 billion worth of SHIB. The founders have apparently gone to great lengths to hide their holdings as they keep moving them across separate wallets. In doing so, Shibburn believes that they have impeded the ecosystem’s growth as some of these tokens are meant to be burnt. Shibburn went as far as alleging that Ryoshi didn’t care about SHIB’s development and was only out for themselves. Shiba Inu Founders Only Out To Enrich Themselves As part of the shocking revelations, Shibburn mentioned that Ryoshi may not be who many think of them as. Instead, they are said to be a “group of greedy investors” who are just looking to profit off the community. To achieve this, SHIB is said to be their “golden goose,” which they use as a means to enrich themselves. Besides Ryoshi, SHIB’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, was also caught up in the mix. Shibburn accused the developer of not being a “real dev” and suggested that Shytoshi was also out to make profits off the community. One instance that they alluded to was how the developers allegedly rewarded themselves with a “large amount of $BONE” when ShibaSwap was created. Related Reading: AVAX Holders Beware: $204 Million Token Unlock Could Trigger Price Crash Today Shibburn hinted that was the reason why BONE was made a gas token for Shibarium, possibly in a bid to increase the token’s utility and make it more valuable. Shytoshi has yet to respond to these allegations neither has anything been posted on the official announcements blog, where the developers are known to give regular updates. Shiba Inu also seems unfazed by these allegations. At the time of writing, the meme coin is trading at around $0.000008189, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Kwon was arrested in the country in March after being caught in Podgorica's airport with falsified documents.  The final decision on the extradition will be made by the Montenegrin Justice Minister, after Kwon serves a four-month prison sentence in Montenegro for document forgery, it said.  Following his arrest in Montenegro, Kwon faces multiple counts of fraud charged by U.S. federal prosecutors, in addition to existing civil charges in the U.S. and an ongoing investigation in South Korea related to last year's terraUSD collapse.

In April, Daniel Shin, co-founder of Terraform Labs, was indicted in South Korea for capital markets law violations, with prosecutors freezing $185 million in assets.

42419098,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDebF,1700814388,Bitcoin's 3-Week Consolidation Under $38K Has Bullish Undertone,"Bitcoin's three-week consolidation below $38,000 has a bullish undertone of shallow price dips, a positive sign, one observer said.  Seasonality is supportive of continued gains in bitcoin's price in December.  Bitcoin's [BTC] price rally has stalled since Nov. 9, with $38,000 proving a tough nut to crack. That does not necessarily mean the uptrend is over.  In fact, a closer look at how prices have behaved during the consolidation suggests it isn't.  While the gains have been capped closer to $38,000, the subsequent pullbacks have been shallow and short-lived, a sign of persistent ""buy-the-dip"" demand within the price consolidation. The horizontal upper bound of resistance and rising lower bound from shallow dips can be identified as an ascending triangle formation on the price chart.  In other words, bitcoin could be building energy for the next leg higher.  ""Bitcoin bounces around in an ascending channel, hitting its three-week upper resistance of $37.8K on Wednesday evening. An intensifying sell-off thwarts attempts to heat the price, but the pullbacks have become less deep over the past three weeks, suggesting the building up of bullish sentiment,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, a senior market analyst at FxPro, said in an email.  Ascending triangles mostly end with a bullish breakout, extending the preceding uptrend, according to chartered market technician Charles D. Kirkpatrick II and technical analyst Julie R. Dahlquist's book ""Technical Analysis: The Complete Resource for Financial Market Technicians 3rd Edition."" The book focuses on traditional markets.  ""Upward breakouts occur 77% of the time, and breakouts happen roughly 61% of the distance (time) from the base to the cradle,"" Kirkpatrick II and Dahlquist say in the book while warning of the potential for failed breakouts. A fake breakout happens when prices move beyond the resistance, only to fall back into the pattern quickly, trapping buyers on the wrong side of the market.  Kuptsikevich sees bitcoin rising above $40,000 on a potential ascending triangle breakout. According to Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto services provider Matrixport, a breakout could see bitcoin potentially targeting $45,000.  Data tracked by pseudonymous market analyst Skew show unwinding of short perpetual futures positions on Bybit and a renewed interest in bullish bets on Binance. Unwinding of shorts or bets on a price drop often puts an upward pressure on prices.  Perhaps, the long-held resistance near $38,000 could soon come into play.  Seasonal trends favor a continued higher move in cryptocurrency. Bitcoin's average gain in December over the last eight years has been 12%, according to data tracked by Matrixport.  ""Seasonality appears to be working again. The average return in December of +12% is respectable and could lift Bitcoin to $42,000 — by this metric alone,"" Thielen said in a note to clients Thursday.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/24/bitcoins-3-week-consolidation-under-38k-has-bullish-undertone,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9f27a2c1990f025e7a1c3c983addb08e27db6d81-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

20634691,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562238,1700813717,Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETF Conversion Could Lead To $2.7 Billion Exodus: JPMorgan,"In a new analysis, JPMorgan has raised concerns about the potential outflow of funds following the possible conversion of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF. The banking giant estimates that the conversion could prompt investors to withdraw at least $2.7 billion. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, a pivotal force in the previous bull market, has seen its discount to Bitcoin’s current market price shrink from -46% at the beginning of the year to -9.77% by November 22, the lowest level since mid-August 2021. Notably, this reduction in discount is important because it indicates that investors are expecting the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve Grayscale’s conversion to a spot Bitcoin ETF. However, JP Morgan has cautioned that this conversion might lead to some instability in the market. $2.7 Billion Exodus Following Bitcoin ETF Approval? JPMorgan analysts, including Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, have scrutinized the inflows into GBTC since the beginning of 2023, revealing a calculated strategy by traders to exploit the discount for profit upon ETF conversion. The bank’s methodology considered the cumulative signed dollar volume, accounting for both the volume of shares traded and the direction of the price movement. Related Reading: Trader: Bitcoin Will Inevitably Breeze Past $70,000—Here’s Why The analysts posit that this influx, primarily driven by speculation over GBTC’s conversion to an ETF, will likely reverse as investors seek to capitalize on the arbitrage opportunity presented by the narrowing of the discount to net asset value. The minimum anticipated outflow, upon conversion to an ETF, stands at $2.7 billion. However, this could escalate if GBTC’s current fee structure, standing at 200 basis points, isn’t significantly reduced post-conversion. The competitive landscape, as suggested by the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF’s 80 basis points fee, necessitates such a reduction for GBTC to maintain its market dominance. The impact on the market could be profound. A full withdrawal of the $2.7 billion could exert substantial downward pressure on Bitcoin prices. However, JPMorgan analysts believe that much of this capital will likely be reallocated to other Bitcoin-related instruments, mitigating any drastic market disturbance. Related Reading: Grayscale Files Updated Spot ETF As Bitcoin Barrels Past $37,000 They predict a reconfiguration of assets, shifting from $23 billion in GBTC and $5 billion in other funds to $20 billion in the trust and $8 billion in other vehicles. Nonetheless, they caution that a portion of the funds may exit the Bitcoin space entirely, which would pose a risk of a downturn in Bitcoin prices. Remarkably, JP Morgan analysts led by Panigirtzoglou have predicted in early September that the SEC will be forced to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs after losing the case against Grayscale. Moreover, JP Morgan’s forecast hinges on the assumption that the approval of a batch of ETFs will ignite more intense competition among Bitcoin investment products, likely resulting in a fee structure more aligned with those of Gold ETFs, typically around 50 basis points. As the market awaits the SEC’s decision, the primary concern remains: Whether the anticipated GBTC outflows will find a new home within the Bitcoin space or if they will signify a broader withdrawal from BTC investments. At press time, BTC traded at $37,560.

There was a break above a key declining channel with resistance near $5.25 on the 4-hour chart of the UNI/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might correct lower, but the bulls could be active near the $5.60 and $5.55 levels. UNI Price Regains Strength After forming a support base above $4.80, UNI started a fresh surge.

ETH is now consolidating gains and might soon aim for another rally toward the $2,150 level. Ethereum is consolidating and facing resistance near the $2,080 zone. The price is trading above $2,030 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a short-term contracting triangle forming with resistance near $2,080 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could extend its rally if it clears the $2,080 and $2,090 resistance levels. Ethereum Price Holds Ground Ethereum price started a strong increase above the $2,000 resistance zone.
