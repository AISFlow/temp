The eGifter Points program, officially launched today by the New York-based company, skews discounts favorably toward the company's decentralized payment options.  Customers in the rewards program only receive a 2% discount for using PayPal, and 1% for using credit cards to buy eGifter cards from major merchandisers.  Tyler Rowe, eGifter's co-founder and CEO, said:  ""Because cryptocurrencies cost less for transactions, we're excited to be able to offer higher returns for those purchases to encourage additional usage.""  Discounts for bitcoin  It is becoming increasingly popular to offer discounts for consumers that use digital currencies such as bitcoin, as there are fewer fees and potential risks for merchants – who can pass savings on to customers.  Mobile gift card provider Gyft offers a similar rewards strategy. It has been offering a 3% points reward on bitcoin gift card purchases for some time, although Gyft only accepts BTC.  CEO Vinny Lingham has spoken publicly about his company's reduced fraud exposure with transactions in bitcoin, one of the reasons Gyft is able to offer bitcoin discounts for its customers.  Another offering called Coin for Coffee also exemplifies the cost savings of using digital currencies. With that program, a user can buy discounted Starbucks drinks with bitcoin, and leftover money from each transaction is returned to the user shortly thereafter.  About eGifter  Founded in 2011, eGifter started using Coinbase to accept bitcoin payments last September. Earlier this month, the company partnered with processor GoCoin to accept dogecoin and litecoin as well.  At the end of last year, eGifter received $2.2m in venture capital funding, the majority of which came from $1.7m in an angel round. The company has mobile apps for gift card transactions available in the Apple App Store as well as the Google Play Store.  eGifter offers more than 150 electronic gift cards from retailers such as JCPenney and Lowes, as well as restaurant chains like Domino's Pizza and Chili's.

42425592,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIcfTh,1398286564,Investor Group Optimistic in Fight to Stop Mt. Gox Liquidation,"A group of investors are seeking to stop the defunct Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox from being liquidated following its failed bankruptcy bid.  A final decision will be made by 9th May by a court-appointed administrator as to whether or not Sunlot Holdings – which represents the investor group – is granted permission to buy out the exchange.  Mt. Gox was placed into liquidation on 16th April, with Japanese courts citing the difficulty in resurrecting the exchange as well as the dwindling likelihood of this possibility as key reasons for recommending the move. However, it's exactly this claim that Sunlot holdings is looking to call into question with its bid.  To this end, the group is taking a multi-pronged approach in its effort to take over Mt. Gox, which so far has included the launch of an online petition and a community action movement called SaveGox.  In interviews with CoinDesk, several key players associated with the effort say that if Mt. Gox is liquidated, the damage done to bitcoin's reputation could be far-reaching.  Jon Holmquist, the founder of Bitcoin Black Friday and a driving force behind the initiative, told CoinDesk that the effort is less about reviving a troubled exchange and more about returning confidence among customers and the wider digital currency community. The group originally announced its intent to buy the exchange for 1 BTC on 10th April.  Said Holmquist:  ""This isn't about Gox. This is about helping the community get their coins back while also kickstarting a new exchange.""  The investor group attempting to purchase the exchange includes John Betts, Matthew Roszak, William Quigley and Brock Pierce.  Group seeks restoration of confidence  According to Betts, the primary aim of the effort is to return as much value to Mt. Gox's customers as possible, while also supporting the broader bitcoin space.  He told CoinDesk:  ""We're hoping to make the customers whole. And as part of that, reinstill confidence in the bitcoin ecosystem.""  He added that the collapse of Mt. Gox has led to significant damage to the perception of bitcoin, both among consumers and the business community.  Betts acknowledged the legal and technical issues involved with the investor group's bid as more immediate challenges. Following that, the hurdle of regaining confidence in both Mt. Gox and bitcoin as a whole will still remain.  On the other hand, Betts rejected the notion that the situation is unresolvable.  ""We firmly believe that there is a strong hope to rebuild this exchange, to get the community going forward. It's best for the creditors - otherwise, there is no way that they're going to recover their losses.""  Betts encouraged any customers affected by the collapse of Mt. Gox to sign up on SaveGox.com and to reach out to the rehabilitation team as the effort develops.  Said Betts:  ""It's important to have strong communication, direction communication with the customers, any communication about what our plan is going to be as we release that and as we move through this process.""  Investors pitch rehabilitation plan  As part of this effort, Sunlot Holdings has submitted a comprehensive rehabilitation proposal to the Tokyo District Court.  According to the document, the investors would take control of the company with the primary goal of repaying customers for funds lost in the aftermath of Mt. Gox's collapse. The group has received a positive response from the site's creditors, amounting to more than 70% of those seeking claims against Mt. Gox, The Wall Street Journal reported.  The plan outlines the new management team, with Betts serving as the new CEO and Quigley as acting CFO.  If the Tokyo court were to grant permission to Sunlot to take control of Mt. Gox, the first step would be the departure of the site's current leadership. Then, comprehsnsive financial and legal audits would be performed to ascertain the exact value of the company and how much each creditor is owed.  This process would also involve the complete reconstruction of the existing exchange code, including security upgrades to prevent some of the technological weaknesses that reportedly led to years of bitcoin thefts.  The document suggests that roughly $8m will be needed to fund the rehabilitation, drawing from cash held by Mt. Gox.  The investors said in the filing:  ""The value we, the Sponsor Company, can bring to the business rehabilitation of MTGOX company is the specialized capabilities in the areas of management, finance and technology as bitcoin specialists, and it is precisely these that can overcome the current crisis, restart the exchange and grow the business once again, thereby serving as a resource for the capacity to make payments to creditors.""  The group cautioned:  ""Without our specialized capabilities and our active involvement, it would probably not be possible for MTGOX company’s creditors to recuperate their money.""  Plan to repay creditors  The 200,000 BTC discovered by Mt. Gox's leadership in March will be used to make payments to creditors. Creditors can opt to receive a proportional payment in bitcoins from that sum or an equivalent amount in equity in the site.  Sunlot said in its filing that Mt. Gox has an outstanding debt balance of nearly $550m, including 858,125 BTC. After the disbursement of the 200,000 BTC, this amount will fall to roughly $421m.  Half of commissions earned during trading will be diverted to a fund that will be used to make payments to Mt. Gox's creditors. Disbursements from the fund will be issued quarterly, according to the document.  Additionally, creditors that receive distributed funds must wait a year until they can seek a cash redemption.  CoinDesk will continue monitor this developing story.

42425604,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIcfrh,1398283813,"Blockchain's Nic Cary on Bitcoin Wallets, Mt. Gox and Decentralization","Nicolas Cary is the CEO of Blockchain, a bitcoin company best known for providing the most popular consumer bitcoin wallet and block explorer.  Blockchain.info, the company's informational website, garners 350 million page views a month, while its wallet service passed 1 million downloads in January 2014. Blockchain also acquired multi-exchange bitcoin trading platform ZeroBlock earlier this year.  Cary was a keynote speaker on day one of Inside Bitcoins NYC this month, where he discussed the potential global impact of the technology. There, CoinDesk spoke to Cary about recent developments at Blockchain, how it aims to hold off competition in the market and what it learned from its high-profile service outage in March.  CoinDesk: Blockchain has accomplished a lot in a short time, operating successfully in three different business sectors. How are you aiming to take your company forward in 2014?  Nic Cary: We're going to launch Blockchain.com as the main consumer-facing wallet site. Our intention for doing that is to spend a lot more time on the user experience and making bitcoin more familiar to regular users.  Blockchain.info sort of set one design standard for what a bitcoin wallet could look like, and its been copied a lot, and we have to keep making bitcoin easier. The fact is we have 1.5 million users today, but we need to be ready to take on 10 million users, 100 million users. Everything has to get easier, from the signup process to acquiring bitcoins to figuring out where to spend them to inviting friends to the education of bitcoin itself.  Too many times the conversation of how to set up a wallet starts at a table like this where you sit down across from someone and say that 'I need 30 minutes of your time to learn why this is the most important thing you're going to hear about for the next few months.' That conversation has to get easier.  Blockchain is an established player in an ecosystem that's very much still growing. Are you worried about competition, especially in foreign markets with this approach?  Nic Cary: We're watching the competitive developments in the landscape carefully, but we're not obsessing about them. This is very early, there's a lot of upside for everyone. I don't think we'll bat 1.000 across everything, but when you think about how these other companies are building their products, you need to think about the innovation. Are they actually innovative or did they just build a new bank?  Whether you're talking about Mt. Gox or any of the other businesses that had security issues, what you're talking about is a company that held custody and control over user funds and had access to information about their customers.  There are two approaches, you can centralise everything and build a new PayPal for bitcoin, or you can embrace the peer-to-peer network and create technologies that basically cut out the trust in the products and the services at all and allow people to directly interface in the bitcoin network, that's our marketing and that's our position.  We do not have custodial accounts. That's the biggest difference between us and all the other big players, including Circle, Coinbase, Bitstamp, all the exchanges, they all have centralised control over bitcoins.  But this isn't a zero-sum game, there isn't one solution that's going to win out.  Do you think there's a disadvantage in taking a one-size-fits-all approach to not taking into account localization when building your product?  Nic Cary: For managing our brand, it's going to be challenging to have really localized solutions. I anticipate and expect the wallet market will fragment quite a bit in 2014. I think you'll see companies build solutions for specific countries and specific use cases.  I could see a wallet service that lives on cell phones and has parental controls, and if a kid leaves a certain region it deducts $5 from the wallet, or it notifies the parent that they spent the funds. I don't have an interest in building these solutions, what we're interested in is providing the piping in the background for it.  Many of the major exchanges and wallets are still using our APIs to broadcast to the bitcoin network and we provide all these services for free.  We hope that lots of people build sweet wallet solutions for whatever country they're in, I'd like it if they used Blockchain's APIs but all of our stuff is basically open-source anyway so they could copy it if they want to.  You recently went through a high-profile outage. What did Blockchain learn from this, and what did you learn as its CEO?  Any time you have growing pains, you're going to need to make new investments in your infrastructure. Because we take extreme care for the security of our services, we don't trust other parties to build things, but that means you have to develop in-house expertise on really complicated server infrastructures.  No one can predict how fast bitcoin adoption is going to happen. This has huge costs for companies like mine, especially because we're a free service. We didn't know how fast things would happen in November, we were behind in adding infrastructure, we made a bunch of investments and we're still making investments in anticipating a greater adoption of bitcoin in the future.  For us, the lesson is that when you're having a problem you have to communicate with people, it's completely unforgivable to not be transparent about the issues that are happening.  We have to get better, and it was intolerably to me to have that happen. We're going to keep learning from it.  Do you see your company as a leader in the space?  I think for us, we take the trust of our users so incredibly seriously. You just can't screw that up. I hope that we can be known as being trustworthy and to build a brand around Blockchain that is enduring. I don't want to be thought of as the PayPal for bitcoin, or Google.  I just want to be Blockchain, that's us. It means that we take care of our users, that we're transparent, that we build open-source software, that you can trust the math and the code and that we'll put it all out there for everybody to see.  Do you see yourself as a leader in the space?  My focus is on building products and services and finding teammates that deserve each other to make Blockchain a happy place. I see myself as the CEO of Blockchain first before any other type of figurehead in any way shape or form.  This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

42425594,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIcfXh,1398277530,US Election Commission Delays Decision on Bitcoin Campaign Contributions,"The US Federal Election Commission (FEC) has delayed a formal decision on whether to allow bitcoin-denominated campaign contributions, widely expected to be announced today. However, a senior official suggested that limited contributions may be acceptable in the future.  As reported by The Hill, the commission was considering a petition to allow bitcoin campaign contributions in amounts up to $100. The petition was submitted by Make Your Laws (MYL) PAC.  During the meeting, Commission Vice Chairwoman Anne Ravel reportedly gave voice to potential issues regarding the anonymity associated with bitcoin campaign donations, saying:  ""I have serious concerns about allowing unlimited bitcoin political contributions.""  She added that she would support a compromise on limited bitcoin campaign contributions, so long as they are treated like cash donations, which are capped at $100.  Other members of the commission voiced support, including Ellen Weintraub who said that ""a majority of commissioners would be prepared to say yes"" to MYL PAC's petition.  The FEC told CoinDesk that the decision will be delayed until the FEC's next meeting on 8th May.  Early efforts stalled  Last November, the Conservative Action Fund (CAF) sought guidance on bitcoin campaign contributions. The FEC’s original draft opinion, dated 7th November, was encouraging. It allowed bitcoin donations, treating them as in-kind contributions under valuation, reporting and disbursement procedures.  There were some limitations, however. CAF was told that it could not make disbursements using bitcoins. It would have to sell all bitcoins it managed to raise and deposit the proceeds in its campaigns accounts before using them.  CAF told the FEC that it plans to use bitcoin payment processor BitPay. Since BitPay’s model allows clients to receive either bitcoin or US dollars, the FEC caveat does not make much of a difference.  CAF said it would not accept anonymous contributions. Anyone who makes a contribution in bitcoin will be required to disclose personal information needed to ascertain the donor’s identity.  New petition more limited  After efforts by the CAF stalled, Make Your Laws (MYL) PAC sought more information on bitcoin contributions from the FEC. Unlike CAF’s request, MYL wanted clarification on a few new issues. The PAC proposes to accept, purchase and disburse bitcoins in compliance with FEC regulations, and offered an explanation of how it would prevent itself from accepting anonymous contributions.  However, MYL is proposing a number of limitations. Bitcoin contributions would be limited to $100, contributors would have to reveal their identity by providing their name, occupation, address and other details. They would also have to confirm that they are donating their own bitcoin rather than channelling funds for a third party. MYL plans to cash out the donations in US dollars.  The FEC pointed out that bitcoin does not meet regulatory definition of money and they are not negotiable instruments. Therefore some limitations apply, as bitcoins do not come with an unconditional promise to pay a fixed amount of money for each bitcoin.  An official press release on today's announcement is expected later today, the FEC said.

42374522,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvlCgP,1398276640,Cleveland Merchants Join Forces for 'Bitcoin Boulevard US' Promotion,"Nikhil Chand, founder of CoinNEO, a bitcoin consultancy based in Cleveland Heights, is orchestrating the launch of Bitcoin Boulevard US. He told CoinDesk that the project aims to highlight the positive business aspects of digital currency. Said Chand:  ""There's an opportunity here [...] for businesses to really make a statement about digital payments, mobile payments, electronic payments, increasing their margins [and] lowering fees.""  Chand also stressed the benefits the project would have for the local community, stating:  ""There's a global awareness around bitcoin, and if I can help my community with brand awareness through brand awareness, that becomes a social experiment as well.  Bitcoin Boulevard US is styled after a similar initiative to take place in the Netherlands this May.  Bitcoin acceptance from the ground up  CoinNEO helped The Wine Spot, a local wine and beer store in Cleveland Heights, integrate bitcoin payments in February.  Following the success of that initiative, Chand began reaching out to other local businesses about the possibility of conducting more bitcoin payment integrations in the community.  So far, he has confirmed eight businesses for the 1st May launch, with more expressing interest.  Part of the process of getting Bitcoin Boulevard US off the ground has been communicating with state regulatory agencies in Ohio, including the Ohio Department of Commerce's Division of Liquor Control.  As several participant merchants run bars, maintaining lines of communications with license-issuing agencies was a major focus for Chand. He cited a lack of information among some regulators, but noted that the response has been cautiously positive overall.  Chand said that he expected a level of misunderstanding because there are no legal provisions regarding bitcoin and other digital currencies.  He added that state agencies have been receptive overall and that the process has been an important one for the future of digital currency adoption.  Said Chand:  ""We're working very closely, and I think we're having some very pioneering talks with state regulatory agencies around the topic of bitcoin payments processing.""  Merchants positive ahead of 1st May launch  Doug Katz, owner of The Katz Club Diner, told CoinDesk that the project grew out of the local business community's already strong ties. He said discussions among other owners in the area began after The Wine Spot's integration.  — The Katz Club Diner (@KatzClubDiner) June 12, 2013  Katz added that he believes other businesses in the area will begin accepting bitcoins as a form of payment in the future.  ""I think what'll happen is, other merchants in our community will start taking [bitcoin] as well. So, if it kicks off and offers promotion for us, and other people learn about, other people will start taking it.  Chris Armington, owner the Tavern Company, told CoinDesk that he hopes the idea creates more interest in the Lee Street community. As a business owner, he said the transaction process was easy and that the cost reduction could be ""huge"".  Said Armington:  ""If everybody uses it and it was 1% [transaction fees], merchants would save a ton of money.""  Adam Fleischer, owner of The Wine Spot, said in an interview that Bitcoin Boulevard US is a boon for both consumers and merchants.  ""From a consumers perspective, customers seem to be happy and appreciative to be able to spend their bitcoins at a brick-and-mortar business. From a merchants perspective, if you want to be innovative, and on the forefront, plus have fun with something that may be the next big wave...why not?""  Business views on bitcoin take shape in US  Small businesses in the United States are slowly but surely coming around to the idea of accepting bitcoins as a form of payment.  Recently, several business owners spoke with CoinDesk about their experiences following bitcoin payments integration. They cited what some Lee Road merchants told CoinDesk – that bitcoin acceptance has opened doors to new customers who might not have visited otherwise.  As more small businesses embrace bitcoin, Congressional lawmakers have begun exploring the implications for merchants that use digital currencies. Last month, the US House of Representatives committee on small business held a hearing on the benefits and risks for companies that get involved with bitcoin.

42425589,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIcfRh,1398272437,Atlas ATS Joins Forces with US Stock Exchange to Avoid Regulatory Hurdles,"Bitcoin trading platform Atlas ATS has teamed up with the New Jersey-based National Stock Exchange in an effort to speed up regulatory approval.  With the move, Atlas ATS has revealed rather ambitious plans, as it is also in the process of launching a globally integrated bitcoin exchange in conjunction with Perseus Telecom.  The firms hope to bring industrial-strength security and regulatory compliance to the world of bitcoin, with the aim of attracting institutional investors and individuals who do not want to deal with unregulated, often anonymous bitcoin exchanges.  Bypassing red tape  The National Stock Exchange is a relatively small exchange, but it is recognised by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a self-regulatory organisation (SRO). Under the agreement, Atlas ATS will become the first bitcoin exchange regulated by an SEC-approved entity.  The Wall Street Journal points out that it is still unclear how the SEC will respond to the deal. If Atlas ATS gets the green light and if the SEC recognizes its compliance, the exchange could save a lot of time and resolve potential regulatory issues.  The biggest hurdle facing US-based bitcoin exchanges is that they need to get FinCEN money transmitting licences from all 50 states. If the Atlas ATS deal goes through, however, it will not have to.  However, the SEC has not yet made any statement about the proposed partnership.  High-frequency trading?  Atlas ATS's ultimate goal is to create a regulated, globally integrated exchange. The company currently operates sister exchanges in Hong Kong and Singapore, processing up to 10,000 transactions a day. However, the public exchange is seeing a lot less volume, just 100 to 1,000 transactions a day.  Atlas says it will comply with SEC rules governing stock and option exchanges in the US. Its platform relies high-bandwidth communications with a lot of automation, allowing it to function in a similar fashion to high-frequency trading (HFT) firms.  HFT companies have been taking a lot of flak lately over their practices and some lawmakers in the US even called for hearings on the subject earlier this month.  The impact of high-frequency traders on markets and competitiveness has become a rather controversial subject and that controversy could soon be coming to the bitcoin markets.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/23/atlas-ats-joins-forces-with-us-stock-exchange-to-avoid-regulatory-hurdles,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cdcc0ccd652d5c2a5375178221b7ea9f27aa1329-1000x665.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425600,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIcfjh,1398267302,Nearly $500k Sitting Unclaimed in Silk Road 2.0 Bitcoin Wallets,"Notorious online black market Silk Road 2.0 lost roughly 4,476 BTC (then roughly $2.6m) early this February when its security was compromised in a transaction malleability attack.  However, the repayment plan it subsequently implemented is already seeing success, a new report from Vice suggests. The media outlet indicates that 50% of the site's hacking victims have been completely repaid as of 8th April.  Announced on 17th February, Silk Road 2.0's repayment plan sought to reimburse the estimated 47% of its users that lost bitcoins in the breach. To refund the accounts, Silk Road 2.0 moderators agreed to go without payment and to charge 5% commission on purchases, with the proceeds going towards paying back victims.  Most notably, however, Silk Road 2.0 moderator Defcon said that more than 1,000 BTC ($483,698 at press time) is still sitting unclaimed in the wallets of users who have not logged into the site since the breach.  Silk Road 2.0 launched on 6th November following the shutdown and seizure of the original Silk Road in October of last year. As of 13th March, Silk Road 2.0 indicated that more than 13% of the stolen funds had been repaid.  More details  Speaking to Vice, one representative of Silk Road 2.0, named DoctorClu, elaborated on why he believes so many users have yet to reclaim funds.  Said DoctorClu:  ""Most simply did not think that such a large repayment was possible given its amount. Like so many other hacks/seizures/scams, many could not believe that we would ever be able to give back what was stolen, or that we would even promise such a thing.""  The news source went on to suggest that continued questions about the site's security could also be a factor, though it did not speak to any former users directly.  Rebuilding trust  The latter comment is indicative of a decline in trust on the black market, which can be best observed on message boards. For example, following the initial hack, upset users took to Silk Road's subreddit to discuss their displeasure over the issue, though Vice notes there's been an increase in positive posts from repaid users.  A reddit poll cited by the news source suggests that roughly one-fourth of those who were affected by the hack are still waiting for their lost bitcoins.  However, Defcon told Vice that Silk Road 2.0 hopes to win over these customers soon, saying:  ""All of our staff's fee earnings will continue to be invested back into the community until every victim is paid back.""  As of now, Defcon projects that all customers will be fully reimbursed by mid-June, though it remains to be seen how many bitcoins will remain unclaimed.

42425609,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIcg1h,1398260866,Is Double Spending Unconfirmed Transactions a Concern for Bitcoin?,"One of the key reasons that bitcoin has become a popular form of value, to the tune of $6bn, is that it has largely solved the double-spending problem that plagued other digital currencies before it.  Interestingly, this double-spending problem isn't limited to the digital realm. The BBC reported that there were 566,000 counterfeit notes circulating in the UK in 2009. Additionally, in 2010 the UK Treasury estimated that one in 36 £1 coins in circulation were counterfeit.  The bitcoin network seeks to prevent this problem by signing cryptographic keys that are confirmed on the block chain – bitcoin's general ledger.  However, until the transaction is confirmed, there is a small window of opportunity, and some in the bitcoin community, including reddit user Peter Todd, believe that it is easier to double spend than people may realise.  This is effectively down to the different systems that the various mining pools utilize in confirming transactions – especially small ones, which may offer little reward for miners.  Said Todd:  ""Fact is, unconfirmed transactions aren't safe.""  So how big of a threat is this for merchants accepting bitcoin?  The problem  The issue stems from the fact that, while the network as a whole is working to solve transactions, mining pools operate in different ways. Each pool uses its own software in order to direct the pool's mining power, rather like the way a router moves Internet traffic for a network.  For many, the idea of being able to double spend a small amount of bitcoin by exploiting this flaw would seem trivial.  However, for merchants and organisations that rely on a large number of small transactions, this could be a major concern that threatens the viability of bitcoin as a payment method.  That's why some companies processing bitcoin payments, such as Coinbase, use off-blockchain transactions. Instead of waiting for confirmation, they essentially guarantee that bitcoins transaction go through successfully on their platform by keeping an internal ledger of account.  Eric Springer is the founder of BitUndo, a company that attempts to retrieve unconfirmed transactions on-blockchain. He says that ideas such as replace-by-fee could solve the possible implications of double spending unconfirmed transactions on-block by enforcing the replacement of an existing transaction only with another that has a higher fee.  Said Springer:  ""Bitcoin would be a much better and more secure place with such a policy.""  A test net (alternative bitcoin block chain) implementation of the replace-by-fee idea is already available on GitHub.  Standard policies?  Given that the problem with double spending unconfirmed transactions has to do with the differing ways that mining pools interact with the network, changing the way that transactions work by using replace-by-fee may not be the best solution to the problem.  Said Dan Held, co-founder of ZeroBlock:  ""I think this reinforces the need for standard practices by miners in accepting transactions.""  Held believes that there should be a standard policy in place for confirmation of transactions, instead of different mining pools each treating a transaction differently, even if that's not necessarily by design.  ""If you know a big enough mining pool, you can forward your transactions to them, knowing that the transaction will be sure to go through,"" he added.  Every pool has its own mining rules, and this discrepancy is part of the problem, according to Held. But with the network having such a distributed nature, there's no way to enforce a change to this unless it is made within the core client itself.  Confirmations and nodes  Because of widely held desire for bitcoin to eventually facilitate many small transactions, the idea of zero confirmation should be something that people will get used to.  ""Zero-confirmation but valid transactions are meant to function this way, and there's a risk tolerance at which they're acceptable versus not,"" says Sean Neville, CTO of Circle Internet Financial.  Neville believes that zero confirmations are just a part of the transaction process, which is why some companies use off-block chain transactions. But some organizations are willing to accept that risk in return for using bitcoin as a payment method.  Added Neville:  ""Confirms exist only to solve the double-spend problem for on-chain transactions.""  He said that in order for a transaction to complete, a transfer must occur in the form of a private key signing a transfer – even when there is not yet a confirmation:  ""Without confirms, you can still have valid transactions, and those can certainly have been previously spent, or spent again in the future to force a double spend and failure – unless they're off-chain,"" said Neville.  Neville believes in the power of keeping transactions off the block chain, but it's not the only way to reduce the potential for double spending.  In a paper written by IEEE, researchers found that the more nodes that are connected to the network for a transaction, the lower the chances that it will be double spent.  It's possible, then, that a number of randomly connected nodes to the network could be used in order to prevent double spending when using the block chain.  Looking ahead  Nothing is ever guaranteed, but the issue of unconfirmed transactions causing a crisis of double spending doesn't look likely.  Said Ross McKelvie, Lead Engineer at startup incubator BoostVC:  ""In five years, the average bitcoin user won't be able to execute a double spend, even if the same differences in software exist.""  McKelvie agrees that differences in software between mining pools and users can create some imbalance that allows some people to exploit and double spend. However, it's highly unlikely to affect the network as a whole, he said.  McKelvie thinks that the number of smart people working on the stack in the years to come will be able to strengthen the system to the point where this issue simply won't matter anymore.  Whether that comes about from adding replace-by-fee, implementing new network mining policies, or simply relying on off-block chain transactions – or perhaps even none of these – the bitcoin industry will be able to figure it out.  McKelvie noted, however, that it's best not to be apathetic towards problems like this:  ""That being said, the Internet is a very big space and the Heartbleed vulnerability was out in the wild for two years, so issues like [double spending] are something to be mildly worried about.""

42425608,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIcfzh,1398254428,Jeff Garzik Announces Partnership to Launch Bitcoin Satellites into Space,"A partnership to launch satellites broadcasting the bitcoin block chain from space has been announced by bitcoin core developer Jeff Garzik.  Garzik's Dunvegan Space Systems, in partnership with a company called Deep Space Industries Inc., plans to build satellites called 'BitSats' as part of a bitcoin orbital system, providing redundancy to the network.  The non-profit endeavor plans to have a node in space as a backup in case of terrestrial failure for the Bitcoin network.  Garzik said in a statement:  “We want to keep bitcoin healthy and free by finding alternative ways to distribute block chain data.”  The plan  The idea is to build bitcoin satellites based on the CubeSat modular standard – measuring 10cm on all sides. These BitSats will be launched as hitchhikers on larger payloads into orbit above the Earth.  From orbit, the BitSats will be able to broadcast out as nodes, providing transaction information via solved blocks.  Garzik, who is also a senior software developer at BitPay, argues that space is a tool that can be used to shape bitcoin:  “I believe space holds the promise of our future, and also offers a lot of utility right now.”  The joint project is expected to provide users a downlink from the satellites where they can access the information from space. This downlink will be provided by a vendor, however bitcoin enthusiasts will be able to set up their own receiving equipment.  Donation effort  A plan to launch bitcoin satellites into space may sound audacious, but it is certainly not a joke. Garzik first told CoinDesk about the plan back in December, estimating the costs associated with the project at $2m. However, in context, this is a relatively low figure – as the burgeoning private space industry continues to slash the expense of getting objects into orbit.  In order to fund the project, Garzik and his collaborators are looking to raise money via donations. There is a Google Group for discussion and updates on the BitSat project's progress and a donation address for those interested in contributing.  And it seems other bitcoin fanatics are also space enthusiasts: Richard Branson recently confirmed that six passengers reserving seats on future Virgin Galactic orbital flights paid for tickets in bitcoin.

42425605,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIcfth,1398248943,Iowa State University Hit by Bitcoin Mining Malware,"The Iowa State University has suffered a massive security breach which compromised the security of student data and attempted to mine bitcoin.  The University says the compromised servers contained social security numbers of 29,780 students enrolled between 1995 and 2012.  However, there is no indication that any of the files were accessed. No financial information was stored in the student records and further investigation led the university to conclude that personal information was not the target.  “The servers were hacked by an unknown person or persons seeking to generate enough computing power to create a type of digital money known as bitcoins,” the university said in a statement.  No threat to students  Although university officials do not believe personal information was the intended target, they are urging students and former students to monitor their financial reports, just in case.  The university has reached out to students whose personal information was compromised by the breach; law enforcement was notified of the breach as soon as it was discovered.  Iowa State is also advising caution, as some of the data could be used to stage further attacks, including phishing scams. The compromised servers have been taken offline and destroyed, while other servers of the same type have been taken off the internet as a precaution.  Bitcoin botnets remain a concern  Although many bitcoin miners have dumped x86 platforms with powerful GPUs in favour of bitcoin mining ASICs, hackers are still trying to turn networks into mining zombies. However, this effort does not generate as much money as it used to, as Bitcoin's difficulty has gone up dramatically over the past year.  As a result, bitcoin mining botnets are about to become a footnote in cryptocurrency mining history.  Security firms warn that mining botnets and other bitcoin-related security threats are on the rise, but botnets make a lot more sense if they are used for certain types of ASIC-proof altcoins with a limited market.  However, since hackers who operate bitcoin botnets don’t have to pay the electric bill or the hardware involved in the process, they are still going after regular PCs and servers.  Iowa State has not disclosed any details on the actual amount of bitcoins mined by the attackers. Since it appears that only a handful of servers were affected, it is highly unlikely that they generated many coins.  This was not always the case. Last year German police arrested a couple of botnet miners suspected of mining €700,000 worth of bitcoin.

Although he wasn't able to provide specific details surrounding his release or attendance at the event, Shrem confirmed to CoinDesk that he would attend the launch of the documentary 'The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin', in which he appears.  Arrested publicly  over money laundering allegations in January, Shrem has protested his treatment, saying he had been cooperating with authorities in their investigations into bitcoin's shadier uses.  Since then, Shrem has been under house arrest at his parents' property in Brooklyn. Although free to talk to the media, he has not been allowed out to attend or speak at events – including the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) hearings into digital currencies at which he was due to testify on the day after his arrest.  Exchange pioneer  In 2013, Shrem ran BitInstant, an early bitcoin exchange that raised $1.5m in seed funding led by Winklevoss Capital in May that year, before it ceased online operations two months later. BitInstant was not mentioned in Shrem's initial indictment in January.  He has been accused of facilitating purchases on the now-defunct Silk Road marketplace for advising customers on how to exchange currency for bitcoins, and was indicted on federal money laundering charges on 15th April.  ""The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin"" by programmer and filmmaker Nicholas Mross follows bitcoin's progress over its short history, and features interviews with various bitcoin personalities from the period, including Mt.
