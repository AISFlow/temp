42419368,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUELr3,1698097617,Large Crypto Trader's $7M LINK Deposits to Binance Signals Profit-Taking as Token Hits 17-Month High,"Chainlink's LINK hit a 17-month high on Monday, but there are signs that investors are taking some profits off the table following its massive surge.  The token's price rallied about 9% in the past 24 hours, hitting $11 after trading sideways within roughly $5 and $9 range since May 2022. It has since given up some of its gains but has still managed to advance 43% over the past month, making it one of the best gainers among the large-cap digital assets, CoinDesk data shows.  The native token of the decentralized oracle network Chainlink is benefitting from the recent hype around the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). Tokenization means placing traditional assets such as equity, bonds or real estate on blockchains, and oracles are critical to feeding data from the real world to blockchain-based networks and applications.  Blockchain data, however, suggests the rally could take a breather as exchange deposits picked up, an indication of investors locking in some profits.  Depositing tokens to an exchange usually signals the intention to sell by an investor, while withdrawing tokens indicates a purchase.  Monday marked the largest net influx of LINK tokens – near 1.4 million – to centralized exchanges, data by digital asset analytics firm CryptoQuant shows, extending to four days of consecutive inflows.  On-chain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence noted in social media platform X (formerly Twitter) post that a large trader and LINK holder deposited 300,000 LINK tokens – worth some $3.1 million at the time – to crypto exchange Binance earlier Monday before withdrawing $3 million in USDT stablecoin.  Later, the entity sent another 380,447 LINK valued at $3.9 million to Binance. The investor still held $3.1 million in LINK after the deposits.

Earlier today, during a CNBC interview, Brody emphasized the heightened interest, particularly from family offices. Family Offices Lead The Charge According to Brody, family offices, which typically manage the vast wealth of affluent families, are increasingly diversifying their portfolios with cryptocurrencies. This is not entirely surprising, given the meteoric rise of Bitcoin and its potential as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Move: Is $30,000 Just Around The Corner? Glassnode Founder Predicts However, while family offices are diving headfirst into the crypto pool, institutional investors are more cautious. Brody mentions that these larger entities, controlling over 200 trillion dollars in assets, are awaiting regulatory clarity, such as the approval of a Bitcoin ETF by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, before committing significant resources. Bitcoin, despite comparisons, is distinctly different from traditional assets like gold. Brody highlights a unique trait of Bitcoin: its price does not result in increased issuance. Instead, the issuance of new Bitcoin reduces over time due to halving events. This property makes its price more “rigid,” especially compared to other assets traditionally used as inflation hedges. Moreover, the purpose behind acquiring Bitcoin varies among its buyers. Brody points out: If you look at people who are buying Bitcoin, they are buying it as an asset. They are not buying it as a payment tool. Brody further notes that Ethereum, another major cryptocurrency, is mostly acquired for its utility as a computing platform, particularly for business transactions and decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. Bitcoin To $40,000? So far, Bitcoin has showcased a bullish trend, witnessing a near 10% increase over the past week and a 4.7% uptick in the last 24 hours. This surge has propelled Bitcoin to trade beyond the $31,000 mark, reaching $31,824 recently. Observing the asset’s chart in the 1-day timeframe, BTC seems poised for even higher gains. As shown below, the asset has recently tapped into an order block and could continue its reversal to the upside, reaching a notable high. Additionally, considering the strong institutional demand for BTC, as revealed by Brody, coupled with the potential approval of a spot BTC ETF, a rally to the $40,000 mark seems to be on the horizon. Furthermore, peering into the future of the financial landscape, Brody believes that traditional fiat currencies will continue to hold their ground. However, with the ongoing discussions around Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and the growing adoption of payment stablecoins, the crypto realm may be poised for evolution.

This trend has continued with last week’s numbers which show a significant amount of inflows for Solana compared to the likes of Ethereum. Solana Inflows Reach $15.5 Million According to data from the latest CoinShares report, the inflows into Solana for the last week came out to $15.5 million. This came while some altcoins such as Ethereum saw outflows for the week. For context, Ethereum outflows reached $7.4 million in the same time frame. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Bullish Bitcoin Price Rally To $41,000, Here’s When As a result of the latest round of inflows, the total Solana Asses under Management (AuM) has reached $74 million. This means that the Solana AuM is up 47% year-to-date, compared to Ethereum’s which has dropped continuously this year, climbing to $119 million in outflows year-to-date. Cardano is another altcoin that saw inflows for the week but to a lesser degree. Its inflows were $0.1 million, bringing its total AuM to $24 million, with a $6 million increase year-to-date. Other investment products saw $0.9 million, leading their AuM to reach $76 million. Multi-asset products, however, went the way of Ethereum with outflows of $0.6 million. This brings its AuM to $1.17 billion, a $31 million decrease year-to-date. SOL price sitting at $29.20 | Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview.com Bitcoin Dominates Inflows For the same week, Bitcoin once again came out ahead in terms of inflows, with numbers topping that of Solana. The leading cryptocurrency saw $55.3 million in inflows, bringing its AuM to $24.205 billion. The asset’s month-to-date inflows are currently sitting at an impressive $111.9 million. In the same vein, Bitcoin’s year-to-date inflows have also remained on the high side with $315 million in inflows so far. This has further solidified its position as the leading asset with the most interest from institutional investors so far. Short Bitcoin products were also not left out of the inflow trend. Its weekly inflows sit at $1.6 million, while the month-to-date inflows came out to $4.5 million. Its year-to-date inflows sit at $46 million, bringing its AuM to $99 million. In total, the AuM of crypto investment products is nearly $33 billion. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Points Out Bitcoin Sell Signal That Could Be Triggered Today “Following recent price appreciation, total Assets under Management (AuM) have risen by 15% since their lows in early September, now totalling nearly US$33bn, the highest point since mid-August,” the CoinShares report said. CoinShares also notes that the inflows could be linked to the excitement and anticipation of a Spot Bitcoin ETF being approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However, the numbers are much lower compared to when asset manager BlackRock first announced that it had filed for a Spot Bitcoin ETF.

42419354,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUELef,1698088726,FTX Creditors' Lawyers Promote Deal Giving Investors 90% of What's Left in SBF's Empire,"A deal was secured to pay those who had money at defunct FTX as much as 90% of the assets that remain, and now the lawyers representing some creditors are trying to get enough of those investors on board to make it happen.  Latest News: Sam Bankman-Fried Will Take the Stand in His Own Defense  The 90% arrangement represents a measure of the money remaining after the bankruptcy process – not 90% of what people initially put into FTX.com before the company detonated. So, it's still uncertain exactly how many cents on their dollars people will see returned to them when the dust clears.  The deal also included a key second component regarding those who pulled money out of FTX before it went bankrupt. Customers who managed to get assets from the company from the time of CoinDesk's article revealing the fatal financial weakness at FTX to the moment it collapsed – a nine-day period in early November of 2022 – would have to give back 15% of those funds in exchange for freedom from the bankruptcy liquidators.  ""We want to get the word out,"" said Sarah Paul, a lawyer with Eversheds Sutherland who represents the Ad Hoc Committee of Non-U.S. Customers and its $1 billion in claims against FTX. ""This is a really great result for customers.""  The creditor's group had initially pursued a legal claim that says the assets the customers had at FTX were always their own property and not FTX's, so they should get paid before any unsecured creditors. The ongoing trial of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has revealed how badly the company apparently abused the trust and money of its customers.  ""Everyone who's watching the criminal trial of Sam Bankman-Fried has seen the FTX.com customers were really the victims of mass misappropriation of their assets,"" Paul said in a separate interview Monday on CoinDesk TV.  But the bankruptcy negotiation was always aimed toward a settlement, because it gets money into people's hands much more quickly, Paul explained. The lawyers have until Dec. 1 to get a 75% approval rate from the 60 individuals and entities in their group and with any investors who sign up as members in the coming weeks.  The settlement, if approved by creditors, would still need a sign-off from the bankruptcy court. The end goal would be to get clear of the bankruptcy by about July 2024, when people would be able to retrieve the money that's been locked up since last year, Paul said.  The crypto industry is still too young to have a reliable track record on how much of people's money is usually recovered from a collapsed exchange reportedly riddled with fraud. But even recent history's most infamous Ponzi scheme, that of disgraced financier Bernie Madoff, ended up recovering 88% of customers' money.

Most of the positions wiped out – worth some $110 million – were leveraged shorts, or traders who bet that prices would fall, CoinGlass data shows. This was the second-largest amount of short liquidations in any day since late August.  Bitcoin [BTC] traders were hit by $55 million of liquidations, predominantly those who shorted its price, followed by ether [ETH] traders' roughly $29 million of liquidations, per CoinGlass. Chainlink [LINK] speculators also suffered over $9 million in liquidations as LINK hit its highest price since May 2022.  The liquidations occurred as bitcoin rallied 4% to surpass the $31,000 price level for the first time since July, extending its October advance. Most of the alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, also soared, with Chainlink's LINK, Polygon [MATIC] and Polkadot [DOT] posting 6% to 10% advances at one point.

Circuit Court of Appeals closed the books on a dispute between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Grayscale, with a final ruling that effectively orders the agency to scrap its rejection of the asset manager's spot bitcoin ETF application.  This formal closure of the case on Monday essentially solidifies the court's initial ruling two months ago that the SEC was ""arbitrary and capricious"" in its decision to reject Grayscale's attempt to convert its roughly $17 billion Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot ETF.  The SEC chose not to appeal that ruling, making today's action a formality.  The ball now returns to the SEC's court, where the agency could choose to approve Grayscale's application or perhaps reject it on other grounds. The SEC is also in the process of making decisions on numerous other spot bitcoin ETF applications, including those from asset management giants BlackRock, Fidelity and Franklin Templeton.  ""The Grayscale team looks forward to continuing to work constructively with the SEC to convert GBTC to an ETF,"" spokeswoman Jennifer Rosenthal said in a statement after Monday's conclusion of the case.

According to on-chain data, the level could be the next major milestone for BTC. Bitcoin Realized Price Of 2021 Holders Is $35,000 At The Moment In a new post on X, analyst James V. Straten has discussed the profit/loss situation of the different yearly Bitcoin buyer cohorts. The indicator of interest here is the “realized price,” which keeps track of the average price at which investors in the BTC market bought their coins. When the asset’s spot price is below this metric, the average holder in the sector is at a loss right now. On the other hand, it being above the indicator suggests the dominance of profits among the investors. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Points Out Bitcoin Sell Signal That Could Be Triggered Today Here, Straten hasn’t shared the chart for the ordinary realized price for the entire circulating supply but rather a few versions of the metric that only consider buyers since the start of a particular year. The chart below shows the trend in the Bitcoin realized price for each year since 2017. The data for the different realized price levels | Source: @jimmyvs24 on X As is visible in the graph, the Bitcoin realized price for all years except 2021 is below the current spot price of the cryptocurrency. This implies that the different yearly cohorts of the asset are holding their coins at some net unrealized profit. The latest groups to enter into a state of profit have been the 2022+ and 2023+ ones. The 2021+ group has a realized price of about $35,000 at the moment, which is still a significant distance away, but as Straten has noted, the gap between the spot price and the metric is now the narrowest since the two diverged back at the start of the bear market. Interestingly, during the peak in 2021, this group’s cost basis was around $48,000. The analyst suggests their realized price, since decreasing significantly, indicates some impressive Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) in the market. In on-chain analysis, major cost basis levels have always played an important role, as the BTC spot price has often observed support or resistance on retests of them. The chart shows that the Bitcoin price had found support at the 2023+ realized price back in June. The recent seemingly endless consolidation that BTC saw before the latest rally happened around the 2022+ and 2023+ metrics after they had overlapped. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price’s Next Move Up Will Be Extremely Explosive: Galaxy Given the historical examples, the 2021+ may realize price will cause the price to react somehow when it eventually reaches there. Thus, the $35,000 level would be a significant milestone for the asset, as successfully claiming it could imply clear waters ahead for the cryptocurrency. At the same time, however, the chances of participants buckling and harvesting their gains are increasing with all these groups coming into profits. Such profit-taking can lead to a pullback in the price, at least in the short term. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $31,200, up 11% in the past week.

42419350,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUELYT,1698082907,"All Spot-Bitcoin ETF Applications May be Approved Together, Crypto ETF Expert Predicts","All applications to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for spot bitcoin exchange-traded-funds (ETFs) may be approved together, predicts crypto ETF expert, Volatility Shares Chief Investment Officer Stuart Barton.  Barton's company has already secured one bitcoin ETF first – in June, his company, Volatility Shares’ 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITX), became the first leveraged crypto ETF available in the U.S.  Volatility Shares was also the first to file an application for an ether [ETH] futures-based ETF. The SEC had not approved any of the many previous applicants, but despite this, other companies followed Volatility Shares in applying for an ether futures ETF.  Many of these began trading in October, but despite SEC approval, Barton's team did not launch their ether ETF.  ""We applied first but didn't get the first mover advantage when all applications were approved in one go,"" Barton told CoinDesk in a phone interview. ""This is a precedent-setting event that could be replicated by the SEC in its considerations of spot-bitcoin ETFs.""  To be sure, Barton's entity can still launch its ether ETF. Given the slow start of ether ETFs – less than $2 million were traded on the first day with poor volumes continuing throughout the week – Barton and team may reinvent their product.  ""We could launch any day we wanted but now we have the opportunity to figure out why these ether ETFs are so unpopular,"" Barton said. ""It's weird. Why are ether ETFs so much less popular than bitcoin's launch of a billion dollars in two days? It is now possible for us to wait and make a very small change in our design and we will keep that perspective until we decide exactly what we want to do with it.""  The excitement around spot-bitcoin ETFs has been building up and has hit retail investors. CoinBase said the spot-bitcoin ETF approval is already partially priced in, but when a false news report stated BlackRock's spot-bitcoin application had been approved, bitcoin [BTC] surged from $27,900 to $30,000, with nearly $100 million in liquidations in an hour. JPMorgan said the approval of the spot bitcoin ETFs should happen within months, and probably before Jan. 10, the final deadline for the Ark 21Shares application.  Bloomberg Intelligence analysts and ARK Investment Management’s Cathie Wood seem to agree with Barton in saying that all spot-bitcoin ETF applications could be approved simultaneously. Barton's unique take comes not only from the experience of failing to get the first mover advantage despite being the first to apply for an ether ETF but also because he feels that by successfully approving all ether ETFs in one go, the SEC won the public litmus test, without any legal challenge. Now, they are likely to do it with spot-bitcoin ETFs, he said.  The 12 spot-bitcoin ETF applications are from Grayscale, 21Shares & Ark, BlackRock, Bitwise, VanEck, Wisdomtree, Invesco & Galaxy, Fidelity, Valkyrie, Global X, Hashdex and Franklin.

42419364,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUELq1,1698082874,"Bitcoin Tops $35K, Hitting 16-Month High; Options Positioning Suggests Price Has Further to Run","Bitcoin [BTC] surged past $35,000 Monday, hitting the highest price since May 2022, as cryptocurrency markets continued their October bull run amid optimism that a BTC ETF will get approved in the U.S.  Bitcoin was recently up more than 11% in the past 24 hours to $33,316, pulling back from the peak of its surge but still up dramatically.  There's been a swell of optimism in recent days that the U.S. will get bitcoin ETFs, fueled by a recent court ruling in favor of Grayscale that boosted odds the biggest bitcoin trust, its GBTC product, can be converted into one. And BlackRock's application to list one took a semi-step forward when its proposed product showed up on a Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. website with an assigned unique ID number – something that doesn't mean its ETF was approved but a step some interpreted as a sign the company is confident it will win.  Chainlink's [LINK], Polkadot's native token [DOT] and Polygon's [MATIC] were among the best performing large-cap digital assets with 6%-10% advances. Ether [ETH] andRipple-related token [XRP] posted 2%-3% gains.  The U.S. stock market erased early Monday losses to finish mixed as the 10-year Treasury yield turned sharply lower after hitting 5% for the first time in 16 years earlier in the session.  What's next for BTC price?  The CoinDesk Bitcoin Trend Indicator [BTI], which measures the directional momentum and strength in bitcoin's price action, switched to ""significant uptrend"" as BTC strengthened its footing above the $30,000 level, Todd Groth, head of research at CoinDesk Indices, noted.  ""BTC, ETH and the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) all up week over week while decoupling from tech stocks $QQQ and rising long dated yields,"" tweeted Groth.  Alex Thorn, research head at digital asset investment firm Galaxy, said that the uptrend could accelerate further due to option dealers' need to buy bitcoin on the spot market to hedge their positions above the $30,000 price level.  ""At its peak around $32,500, almost $20 million of BTC will need to be purchased by options dealers for every 1% move up to stay delta neutral,"" Thorn said in a market report. ""The positioning implies that market makers need to buy back increasing amounts of delta as spot moves higher, which should add to the explosiveness of any move in the short term.""  However, activity on the Bitcoin blockchain presents a more pessimistic outlook, ByteTree analysts noted in a Monday report. Transaction numbers dropped 50% in a month, and the Bitcoin network's economic throughput was also in a downtrend, ByteTree's Shehriyar Ali and Seran Dalvi pointed out.  ""This means that the price is driven solely by the anticipation of positive news, which is not necessarily healthy for the short term,"" they said.  The $26,750-$28,250 area would act as a support zone for the BTC's price, Galaxy's Thorn added.  ""If spot moves lower into this range, dealers will also need to buy BTC to stay delta neutral, which should provide additional spot price support if we move lower into that range,"" he explained.

According to his recent thread on X, the options market makers in BTC are currently operating in a position that could significantly amplify any upward movement in its price. “Options market makers in Bitcoin are increasingly short gamma as BTC spot price moves up. This should amplify the explosiveness of any short-term upward move in the near term,” Thorn notes. This implies that as the spot price of Bitcoin rises, these market makers have to buy back more of the cryptocurrency to maintain their positions, a phenomenon that could potentially amplify price surges.

In more explicit terms, Thorn explains, “At $32.5k, market makers need to buy $20 million of delta for every subsequent 1% move higher.” Such positioning suggests that market makers might have to make substantial purchases of Bitcoin as the spot price continues to ascend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Inches Away From Hitting $31,000 – How High Can BTC Go This Week? However, it’s not just upward movements that are impacted. Thorn sheds light on the flip side of the coin as well. “Dealers are long gamma in the $26,750-28,250 range. When you’re long gamma & spot declines, you also have to buy back spot to stay delta neutral,” he comments. This means that any minor downward adjustment in price might find resistance as options dealers make necessary purchases to realign their positions. For bullish investors, these dynamics present an attractive landscape. Thorn elucidates, “This is a great setup for bulls because if spot moves moderately higher, short gamma covering could make it rip much higher pretty quickly, but if it moves lower, long gamma covering could provide some support and limit near-term downside.” Highlighting potential catalysts that might set the Bitcoin spot price in motion, Thorn pointed to the growing anticipation surrounding Bitcoin ETF approvals. Most recently, renowned personalities and institutions such as Cathie Wood, Paul Grewal, JP Morgan, and several analysts from Bloomberg Intelligence have expressed positive sentiments on the odds for approval. Related Reading: Coinbase Bullish: Bitcoin ETF Approval Expected After SEC’s Defeat Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart of Bloomberg predict that the odds of a spot Bitcoin ETF are 75% by the end of this year and 95% by the end of 2024. Additionally, Thorn mentions the recent surge in Bitcoin’s price above $31,000, suggesting it surpassed last month’s highs following the fake news of an ETF approval. Beyond market sentiments and speculations, fundamental supply, and liquidity dynamics also play a role. Thorn mentions, “Bitcoin’s currently constrained supply and liquidity could also serve to amplify upward moves.” Notably, exchange balances of Bitcoin have plummeted to levels not seen since 2018. Simultaneously, smaller entities are accumulating Bitcoin, while larger holders, often termed “whales,” appear to be reducing their positions. He underscores the strength of the Bitcoin community with a note on hodlers: “70% of supply has not transacted in 1+ years, 30% in 5+ years… ATHs both.” With all these dynamics at play, Thorn aptly sums up the current state of the Bitcoin market: “The next several months will be very interesting — Bitcoin is the greatest show on earth.” At press time, BTC traded at $30,676.

The only mining stock that fell, though, was Bitdeer (BTDR), which was down about 10% at press time.  The moves in mining shares generally outpace other crypto-related stocks as mining digital assets is their primary source of revenue.

Read more: Michael Saylor's $4.7B Bitcoin Bet Back in the Green  Trouble could loom ahead, though. The bitcoin halving – also known as the halvening – is slated to take place next year. The event will cut in half the reward for successfully mining a bitcoin block. This event takes place roughly every four years and is part of Bitcoin's code to reduce inflationary pressure on the cryptocurrency. Currently, rewards are 6.25 BTC per block or about $187,000 at the current spot price, and in April 2024 or so, they will be reduced to 3.125 BTC per block (approximately $93,000).  Halving is generally considered negative for the mining industry, and investors are keenly focused on the event's impact on the miners, said B. Riley analyst Lucas Pipes. ""We believe that the halving is, first and foremost, negative for the group. However, low-cost producers should fare better than high-cost producers and well-capitalized companies should fare better than levered ones,"" he wrote in a research note on Oct. 20.  Miners are gearing up by either buying more-efficient mining machines or diversifying into alternative sources of income that could help keep them afloat post-halving. In fact, Bit Digital earlier announced that, like many of its peers, it is entering the artificial intelligence (AI) business, which will earn them enough cash flow to sustain their mining business, regardless of where the market is headed.

42419361,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUELjp,1698076902,CipherBlade Founder Says Blockchain Sleuthing Firm 'Hijacked',"Pennsylvania blockchain forensics firm CipherBlade claims that a group of employees executed a “hostile takeover,” in a lawsuit filed in Alaska.  The suit alleges misappropriation of trade secrets, unfair competition and racketeering, which the new management disputes.  This is the second attempt at suing the company’s new leadership; a previous filing was withdrawn from a New York court.  Blockchain forensics firm CipherBlade appears to be under new management – but court documents show the transition of power was far from peaceful.  The Pennsylvania firm claims that a group of employees executed a “hostile takeover” of the company earlier this year while its founder Richard Sanders was volunteering in war-torn Ukraine assisting local police with crypto investigations, according to a lawsuit. In his absence, the firm's clients and some staff were transferred to new CipherBlade entities in Alaska and Singapore, effectively emptying his business, Sanders told CoinDesk.  “Unfortunately, the CipherBlade domain (cipherblade.com), social media pages (including Twitter and LinkedIn) and other CipherBlade property have been stolen from me and from CipherBlade LLC (PA) (my company) by people whom I trusted to uphold my values and keep the company running smoothly,” Sanders wrote in a Monday LinkedIn post.  Now, the company (from which Sanders has stepped away) is making a second attempt at suing cipherblade.com’s new management. The firm withdrew a similar complaint from a New York court earlier this year.  A civil complaint filed last week with the U.S. District Court of Alaska seeks damages for a host of misdeeds including misappropriation of trade secrets, unfair competition and racketeering.  Paul Sibenik, former senior investigator at CipherBlade, and Sanders’ pick to run the Pennsylvania firm after the alleged takeover, said the lawsuit’s goal is to warn old and potential clients that the new CipherBlade does not represent the values of the company Sanders built – and that all of its original senior investigators have left the company.  “It's really about the ethics of what is happening. We don't want them to misrepresent themselves as us, as they have mostly brand new investigators with little to no experience at CipherBlade,” Sibenik said in an interview with CoinDesk. “We just don't want people to think what they're buying into, with CipherBlade now, in any way resembles what historically it would have been.”  Following the publication of this article, CipherBlade posted a statement to LinkedIn saying Sanders' company in Pennsylvania ""was granted a license to the 'CipherBlade' trademark in 2021, as well as usage of certain web-related infrastructure.""  ""Over time, collaboration with Sanders became increasingly difficult, and eventually became conclusively impossible when his expressions of personal animosity reached the point of creating personal safety concerns for multiple individuals. For this and other reasons, the trademark owner revoked the trademark license to Sanders’ company,"" the statement said.  CipherBlade, under Sanders’ leadership, conducted numerous noteworthy investigations into the flow of funds through blockchains, including one that helped free two Venezuelan software engineers wrongly imprisoned over the hacking of a local crypto exchange.  Sanders told CoinDesk that the “hijacked or spin-off CipherBlade” still uses his reputation to draw clients and enhance the platform’s credibility.  “There are still mentions of me, my work and my credentials on cipherblade[.]com’s website despite my continued efforts to have them removed,” Sanders said in the LinkedIn post.  That is not to say Sanders hasn’t faced criticism in the past. In 2019, CipherBlade was accused by journalist and crypto critic Amy Castor of trying to fix the image of crypto exchange ShapeShift when the detective firm claimed the exchange had facilitated the laundering of $6 million less than what the Wall Street Journal had reported in an expose.  The New York court filings from the Pennsylvania firm’s first attempt to sue the new CipherBlade revealed the firm to be a tangled web of companies – which reporters like Castor and David Gerard had previously questioned – spanning the U.K., multiple U.S. states, Singapore and Cyprus.  After the New York court denied Sanders' company’s application for a temporary restraining order and the defendants argued lack of jurisdiction, the firm pulled its lawsuit to refile it in Alaska, home to one of the new entities as well as a defendant.  CipherBlade's new management denies allegations made by Sanders.  ""We vigorously dispute Sanders’ allegations and believe that his claims are baseless, vexatious, and motivated by personal animosity. Our repeated efforts to bring about a more orderly and amicable separation have been consistently rebuffed,"" the company said in the LinkedIn statement.  Although CipherBlade Pennsylvania still exists, and Sibenik is still CEO, it's no longer taking on new clients, he told CoinDesk on Monday.

19275814,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=556620,1698076813,Crypto Analyst Lists Reasons Why Cardano (ADA) Will Not Do Well In The Bull Market,"Many crypto analysts have a list of crypto tokens that they expect to make a run when the bull market returns. Sadly, Cardano (ADA) hasn’t made the list as crypto analyst Lady of Crypto has outlined five reasons why the crypto token will not perform well during that period. Cardano’s Flaws Might Be ADA’s Downfall In a video posted on her YouTube channel, the first reason she stated was that Cardano had a slow development pace and that it could not thrive in a fast-paced crypto industry. She alluded to the time when the blockchain network experienced a delay in the Vasil hard fork and other times when there have been network congestions and an increase in transaction fees. Related Reading: New SHIB-Based Token On The Way? Shiba Inu Team Member Shares Important Update According to her, Cardano is going to continue to fall behind its competition until one day when the network becomes “insignificant.” Secondly, Lady of Crypto mentioned that no one was using the Cardano blockchain. She used data from the crypto analytics platform DefiLlama to drive home her point. Her assertion was based on the daily active users, protocols built on the network, and network’s total value locked (TVL), of which Cardano ranked 13th, 30th, and 15th, respectively, at the time of her making the video. While these rankings might not be bad, she noted that it is bad for Cardano, which positions itself as one of the “blue-chip cryptos” as it suggests that it is underperforming. The third reason seemed to relate to her first reason, as she noted that Cardano was slow and expensive compared to its competitors. She noted that Cardano’s average transaction speed is 20 seconds, which is slower than other networks like Ethereum, Solana, Arbitrum, Polygon, and Avalanche. Transaction fees on the network are also expensive compared to those other networks. ADA recovers to $0.26 | Source: ADAUSD on Tradingview.com Cardano Is Overhyped The Lady of Crypto went on to the fourth reason, where she stated that the network was overhyped, and although the adjective may be subjective, she doesn’t believe that applies in this case. She noted that Cardano has a partnership with McCann Dublin, a global advertising and marketing agency, which has helped to bring about this “manufactured hype” alongside the help of the network’s “cult following.” She suggested that all this hype was just talk, as there was no substance to back it up. Related Reading: Why This Renowned Finance Author Believes Bitcoin Is Headed To $135,000 The last reason is the fact that Cardano doesn’t seem to have any real-world adoption. Although the blockchain company has at different times announced partnerships with governments and institutions, the tangible results of these partnerships are non-existent.” Despite her position on ADA, the Lady of Crypto, at different times, showed her respect for Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, and mentioned that she was down to have a chat with him where he rebuts her stance on the network’s ecosystem.

In a surprise result in Sunday’s first round voting, Milei, with 30% of the tally, finished second to Massa’s 37%. Milei was thought to have been the favorite after winning the August primary presidential vote.  Milei has previously shown support for bitcoin, stating that it ""represents the return of money to its original creator, the private sector.” Milei has also argued for the abolishment of Argentina’s central bank, calling it a “scam.”  Unlike El Salvador president Nayib Bukele, who spearheaded efforts to make bitcoin legal tender in that nation, Milei has called for a “dollarization” of Argentina’s economy, where the inflation rate recently hit 124.4%. However, according to Barclays analysts, consensus for a dollarization proposal does not seem to be that strong.  Massa is against dollarizing the economy and has previously said he wants to launch a central bank digital currency (CBDC) to help with Argentina's inflation crisis.  The run-off election will take place on November 19, with the two candidates aiming to siphon off support from yesterday’s third-place finisher Patricia Bullrich, who garnered about 24% of the vote.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | FIAT | REGULATION,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/23/argentinas-pro-bitcoin-javier-milei-heads-to-run-off-election-against-sergio-massa,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/770330ea7162faa27c0a04d71bde71e68c4cd7ff-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

19273618,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=556651,1698073250,Why Bitcoin Price Could Double To $60K In A Flash,"Bitcoin price action has been known to go “parabolic” when speculation in the crypto market is in full gear. Prices begin to rise rapidly with very few pullbacks in between. According to evidence, a parabolic structure is possibly building that could cause BTCUSD to “double” in a short amount of time. And with the first ever digital asset now above $30K per coin, it means a potential monstrous move to $60K could be on the horizon. Why BTC Could Teleport To $60K In technical analysis, an asset is said to have gone “parabolic” when an increasingly steep upward curve supports a series of higher highs and higher lows. Parabola typically forms in a sideways, horizontal range. After each higher low, price accelerates further, causing the angle of the slope to nearly go vertical. Related Reading: Bitcoin Doom Signal Warns Of 50% Crypto Collapse Bitcoin has done this several times throughout its short history. And after the longest bear market on record, the cryptocurrency could be ready for another parabolic rally. Has Bitcoin built another parabolic base? | BTCUSD on TradingView.com Bases Loaded, Bitcoin Number Up A comparison with the iconic parabolic curve example, possibly puts Bitcoin price at what would be the third touch and third base of a four-base pattern. A rounded parabolic curve is supporting a series of high timeframe higher lows. Base three is significant because it is said to produce a move where the asset “doubles in the shortest period of time.” With Bitcoin near $30K, $60K could be right around the corner if this is an accurate patter. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Could Buck Downtrend With Move To $42,000 Above base three is base four, meaning there is yet another zone of consolidation somewhere above that will touch down on the curved parabolic trend line a final time. From there, the next time it touches the curved line will be after a peak of the parabolic rally. A glimpse into the future? | BTCUSD on TradingView.com Will Crypto Parabola Begin Again? Don’t believe this structure is possible in Bitcoin? Simply take a look at past cycles for an example. In the above chart, Bitcoin formed several bases in a row. After touching the X, price didn’t just “double,” it did 1,700% ROI. Even then, BTCUSD wasn’t done climbing, rallying another 700% from base four. These figures aren’t probable again, but it speaks to the fact that something big very well could be coming soon. Tony is the author of the CoinChartist (VIP) newsletter. Sign up for free.

42419349,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUELZV,1698071083,The U.S. Risks Its Position as a Stablecoin Leader,"Stablecoins are the backbone of the crypto economy. Transactions involving USD-backed stablecoins reached nearly $6.87 trillion in 2022, surpassing the volumes of Mastercard and PayPal. Despite the crypto winter, stablecoin activity has remained resilient, reflecting approximately 40% of all value transacted on blockchain networks. In other words, stablecoins have emerged as an innovation with product-market fit.  Jason Somensatto is the Head of North America Policy at Chainalysis. This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Despite this, the U.S. is struggling to secure its role as the leader on stablecoin policy and competitiveness. As reflected in our recently-published 2023 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report, approximately 60% of all stablecoin activity involves stablecoins issued by non-U.S. domiciled issuers, and the majority of all stablecoin activity occurs through non-U.S. licensed services among the top 50 exchanges. A year ago, the trend was toward greater involvement by U.S.-based regulated companies.  U.S. policymakers should not passively sit back and watch as this trend in the innovation of payments continues. Instead, the U.S. should prioritize passing legislation and implementing regulations that aim to ensure the U.S. is able to properly supervise USD stablecoin activity and benefit from its growth.  The consequences of not acting  The consequences of the U.S. failing to act on stablecoin regulation are significant.  First, well-tailored regulation can provide the U.S. with a mechanism to oversee the adoption and use of USD-pegged financial products and ensure it secures a central role in regulating and supervising the stablecoin issuers at the center of this growing market. The inverse means that the U.S. may lose out on the ability to enforce important regulations around anti-money laundering and countering financing of terrorism, which would have consequences for national and global security as threat actors continue to try to exploit the weak points within crypto networks. Preventing North Korea from continuing to use crypto as a means for funding its nuclear program is only possible if the U.S. continues to have meaningful touchpoints with compliant actors operating within the crypto economy.  Second, the U.S. risks losing out on serving as the home to growing business that are likely to be strategically important in expanding the important role that USD plays in the global economy. Failing to act in a manner that reverses current trends and incentivizes activity through U.S.-based stablecoin service providers allows other countries to not just benefit from this growing sector, but also shift it towards alternative currencies. The U.S. receives numerous advantages from preserving the USD’s indispensable role in the global economy, including reduced costs for consumers, lower borrowing costs for the government, and increased independence in setting monetary policy.  Finally, sound stablecoin regulation not only reflects good policymaking but also presents an added benefit of de-risking the broader economy by diversifying the risks inherent in our banking and payment systems. The alternative is to continue down a path where a single risk to the banking system can have systemic consequences to multiple institutions.  How stablecoins are unique  Stablecoins represent a unique form of transferring value in USD that demand unique consideration by policymakers. Because stablecoins operate on public blockchain networks, they are more accessible, programmable, and transparent than traditional forms of payments through banks and fintech companies.  Far too often, regulators, policy makers, and commentators have looked at potential stablecoin regulation and assessed the risks relative those presented by the institutions facilitating these traditional forms of payments. I believe that stablecoins do not present more or less risk, but rather different risks. In one sense, the fully-backed nature of stablecoins can help mitigate against systemic risk and make supervision of their holdings far simpler for regulators than traditional banks. On the other hand, stablecoins present unique operational risks based on their underlying technology and use in new forms of payment activity that may not have been previously considered by regulators.  Given these shifts in the risk paradigm, ever-increasing global demand for better payments infrastructure, both domestically and cross-border, and continued growth of stablecoin adoption, the US should not tie itself too closely to the traditional banking regulatory model and should lean into new forms of prudential regulation to address this step-function change in payments infrastructure. To that end, there’s been interesting research on how this can happen as a start.  Rethinking regulatory frameworks  There are a handful of bills circulating in Congress that present a fairly novel regulatory framework for supervising stablecoin activity in the US. Most notably, the Clarity for Stablecoins Act proposes a novel framework for banks and nonbanks alike to issue payment stablecoins under the supervision of the Federal Reserve or state regulators in certain circumstances.  I believe this bill and a similar effort in the last Congress appropriately address many of the unique risks presented by stablecoins. For example, the draft legislation would set standards for which assets can be held in reserves, allow the Fed to write rules and examine issuers for operational risks, and mandate regular disclosures to customers.  Beyond the possibility of a bespoke regulatory framework, policymakers should also recognize that the inherent transparency of blockchain technology empowers global regulators, including those in the U.S., to investigate and combat illicit activities efficiently. This transparency can also enhance the enforcement of sanctions, allowing participants throughout the crypto ecosystem to screen for and detect activities involving sanctioned entities.  There continue to be important debates around the regulation of stablecoins, such as the appropriate role of state regulators in registering and supervising stablecoin issuers. These debates are resolvable and should be solved soon in the interest of global competition and necessary regulation.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jason Somensatto,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/10/23/the-us-risks-its-position-as-a-stablecoin-leader,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ba7bf6e376ada7908c014c5e30cc496fedc8df41-3200x1800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Chainlink 30-Day MVRV Ratio Has Crossed The Bearish 20% Mark As explained by an analyst in a post on X, the last three times the LINK MVRV ratio hit similar levels as now, the cryptocurrency registered a sharp drawdown. The “MVRV ratio” (where MVRV stands for Market Value to Realized Value) is an indicator that measures the ratio between the Chainlink market cap and the realized cap. The realized cap here refers to a LINK capitalization model that assumes the true value of each coin in circulation isn’t the same as the asset’s spot price, but rather the price at which the coin last moved on the blockchain. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Points Out Bitcoin Sell Signal That Could Be Triggered Today This price at which the coin was last transferred could be imagined to be the value at which its holder bought it, so the realized cap takes into account the prices at which each investor in the market acquired their LINK. Thus, the realized cap is essentially a measure of the total amount of capital the holders as a whole have invested into Chainlink. Since the MVRV ratio compares the market cap with this metric, it can provide us with info about the profit/loss situation of the investors. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 7-day moving average (MA) of the ChainlinK MVRV ratio over the past year and a half: Looks like the value of the metric has shot up recently | Source: Santiment on X Note that in the above graph, the MVRV ratio shown isn’t just the ordinary version, but rather the 30-day one. What this means is that this indicator only takes into account the data of coins that were moved within the past month. From the chart, it’s visible that the Chainlink 30-day MVRV ratio has observed a strong rise recently as the price of the cryptocurrency has enjoyed sharp upward momentum. The metric has crossed the 21% mark with this increase, suggesting that the investors who bought within the last 30 days are holding 21% more in value than what they put in. Usually, the more the profits held by the investors, the greater their probability of giving in to the allure of profit-taking. As such, whenever the investors are carrying a high amount of profits, the risk of a correction taking place can become significant. In the current case, the Chainlink investors are those who only bought within the past 30 days, which means that this cohort is bound to have fickle-minded hands who would easily be tempted to harvest their gains. Related Reading: Bitcoin Inches Away From Hitting $31,000 – How High Can BTC Go This Week? As the analyst has marked in the chart, it would appear that the last three times the MVRV ratio crossed above 20% for this group, the LINK price observed a sharp decline. In the first two cases, this drawdown was 34% each, while in the third and latest one, it was about 14%, which is still quite a notable drop. If this pattern is anything to go by, Chainlink may see another such correction soon. LINK Price Chainlink has seen another 9% rise during the last 24 hours as its price has now broken above the $10.1 mark.

42419358,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUELcb,1698069068,Coinbase Poised to Make Final Pitch in Bid to Kill SEC Accusations Quickly,"Coinbase has a Tuesday filing deadline to answer the Securities and Exchange Commission's rebuttal of the company's motion to get its major enforcement action dismissed.  The company is said to be ready to underline two legal arguments: that the tokens being traded don't represent investment contracts (and thus securities) and that the SEC is violating the Major Questions Doctrine that outlines the relationship between regulators and Congress.  Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) is set to make its final case on Tuesday that a judge should spring it from the clutches of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its unregistered-securities dispute.  In Coinbase's last word on its motion to get the accusations tossed before trial, a person familiar with the plan said the company will double down on familiar arguments: The SEC hasn't demonstrated the transactions were investments contracts (and thus, securities), because it hasn't shown any actual contracts existed, and the SEC is violating the ""major questions doctrine"" that basically holds that federal agencies have no business regulating novel areas that are awaiting congressional action.  After Coinbase's Tuesday filing deadline, Judge Katherine Polk Failla of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York will have the full arguments from both sides. The judge – who has signaled some skepticism of SEC arguments – will weigh whether Coinbase is irrefutably correct or that there's merit in the SEC's contention that the idea of an investment contract is broader than a traditional, signed agreement. If she's strongly moved by Coinbase's legal argument, she can dismiss the case, though getting a government enforcement action thrown out at this stage is usually a longshot.  The agency had originally targeted Coinbase with an enforcement action in June, and it represents one of the clearest confrontations between the U.S. securities regulator and the crypto industry, represented by a publicly listed U.S. company that's one of the biggest digital assets exchanges. The case's outcome could change the course of the industry in the U.S.  ""This is an extremely important case for, not just the cryptocurrency industry, but for the future of digital assets in America,"" said Jason Gottlieb, a lawyer who works with crypto clients at Morrison Cohen in New York.  Howey test  Coinbase's motion to get an early judgment argued that the SEC is well out of bounds, but the agency responded that the so-called Howey test that legally determines whether something is a security is very flexible and is meant to be widely interpreted. If investors expected profit from a project, that's a central factor, agency officials including Chair Gary Gensler have said.  ""To distract from the fatal flaws in its legal arguments, Coinbase cries foul and seeks to blame the SEC for its current legal predicament,"" SEC lawyers said in their response to Coinbase earlier this month.  But Coinbase has argued – and some judges seemed to agree – that tokens aren't inherently securities themselves and that they have to be attached to an investment contract to be defined that way.  ""The SEC's brief was more of the same,"" said Paul Grewal, Coinbase's chief legal officer, in a statement to CoinDesk. ""We look forward to laying out the facts in our final response brief.""  The SEC has suffered a series of court setbacks that have demonstrated the federal judges in its multi-front battle against the crypto industry aren't rushing to show the agency deference. The SEC's foundation that virtually all cryptocurrencies are securities and that unregistered companies trafficking in them are breaking securities law has developed significant cracks, most notably in the Ripple ruling that said that company didn't violate the law in selling its affiliated XRP cryptocurrency to retail customers.  Major questions  Where the SEC may have some momentum is in Coinbase's other assertion, that the ""major questions doctrine"" – the same legal theory that cost the Biden administration a recent loss in the dispute over canceling student loan debt – should keep the SEC from regulating in a space that Congress is writing legislation about. A recent decision from Judge Jed Rakoff in the Terraform Labs case, he argued that the SEC's regulation of crypto doesn't rise to the ""extraordinary cases"" that the doctrine is meant for. So the agency knows at least one judge in the same court has leaned toward its view.  However, Rakoff was addressing a specific argument in a specific case, and he looked at the industry through the frame of the $1 trillion value of all the industry's tokens.  ""The treatment of digital assets and the sale of digital assets is absolutely a major question,"" Gottlieb said. ""It's much larger than a trillion-dollar question. It's quite literally the future of the global economy.""  Judge Failla will respond in the coming weeks and could ask the parties to come to court and make these same arguments in-person. It could be 2024 before she makes her decision on this motion, but declining Coinbase's request doesn't necessarily represent a big win for the SEC. The case would then keep going into its next stages in which Coinbase would continue to make its arguments in advance of a potential trial.  And this isn't the only battle the SEC and Coinbase are waging in court. The company had also sued the SEC in April, demanding answers to its petition asking the agency whether it would issue rules for crypto. That case may be approaching some conclusion, because the SEC told that court that the agency's staff made a recommendation on Oct. 10 to the five-member commission on how to proceed with Coinbase's petition.

The company's stash was deeply in the red late in 2022 as bitcoin slumped nearly 80% from its November 2021 peak, but catalysts such as a spot ETF and the upcoming halving event have helped bolster fortunes, leading to a near-doubling in price this year.  Formerly the CEO of MicroStrategy and now its executive chairman, Michael Saylor over the years has become one of bitcoin's most vocal supporters and remains a prolific buyer. His firm has so far sold only once: A 708 bitcoin sale in December 2022, worth $11 million at the time.  The company's most recent publicly known purchases were in the weeks ahead of Sept. 24 of this year when it added 5,445 bitcoins for just under $150 million, or an average price of $27,053 each. That brought MicroStrategy's holdings to 158,245 bitcoins acquired at an aggregate purchase price of roughly $4.68 billion, or an average price of $29,582 each.  At the current price of $30,650, the bitcoin bet is in the green by about $1,000 per coin, for a total gain of roughly $160 million.  The firm's holdings of 158,245 bitcoins is nearly 14 times that of the next nearest institutional holder, data from Bitcoin Treasuries show.  And MicroStrategy might be buying even more.

As part of this recent rally, crypto trader Carl From The Moon has shared his Bitcoin analysis, predicting the cryptocurrency is poised for a massive 37% rally that could send the price up to $41,000. Analyst Carl From The Moon Predicts Bitcoin Price Rally Bitcoin has been subject to many price predictions in recent months, particularly as the industry awaits the approval of applications for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Subsequently, Carl Runefelt, also known as Carl From The Moon, based his long-term analysis on a bullish run if these applications were approved. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Points Out Bitcoin Sell Signal That Could Be Triggered Today In a new YouTube video, Carl points out that Bitcoin’s price action has just completed a diamond pattern, and a big breakout move to the upside is imminent in the next 30 days. TRADE ALERT: #Bitcoin diamond pattern. Target: $41,000 within 30 days. More info here: https://t.co/4uX3lL9Sf8 pic.twitter.com/2ABJo5fYiu — Carl From The Moon (@TheMoonCarl) October 22, 2023 Carl sees a few factors indicating Bitcoin is ready to soar. First, the crypto formed an upside movement at the beginning of the year. Subsequently, a diamond pattern began to form around April on the weekly timescale. Now, Bitcoin is in a prime position to clear the $31,000 resistance level, which would surge the cryptocurrency 37% from its current price of around $30,000 up to $41,000. “What we can see now is a massive, massive diamond pattern on the weekly timeframe. And if Bitcoin breaks up like this, then we could see Bitcoin go all the way up to $41,000, which would be absolutely insane, right?” Carl said. For now, Carl remains extremely bullish. Aside from his prediction, Carl also reflected on the current general sentiment of most Bitcoin traders for the near future. He does this by showing his leveraged long positions on different crypto exchanges while planning to add more when a spot Bitcoin ETF is approved. “Any day now, the ETF will come out, and then we will wish that we had these long positions open,” the crypto analyst said. Carl isn’t the only analyst predicting high Bitcoin prices based on the approval of Bitcoin ETFs. Several other experts also think Bitcoin will spike in the coming months, with some giving higher price targets than others. Related Reading: New SHIB-Based Token On The Way?

The landing page for users in the U.K. displays a warning message, although it states ""users may withdraw liquidity, claim delayed tickets or delay unstake via our SDK.""  Marinade is responsible for most of the total value locked (TVL) on the Solana blockchain, with $248 million spread across native and liquid staking products. The amount of assets across the entire Solana blockchain stands at around $350 million, according to DefiLlama.  Marinade currently offers annual yields of 8.15% for native staking and 7.7% for liquid staking, with native staking being rolled out earlier this year.  Orca Finance, Solana's largest decentralized exchange, added geo-blocking for U.K. users. The restrictions against U.K. users appear to be in response to the FCA's new promotions rules, which restrict the marketing of crypto-related products or services.  Centralized crypto businesses like Bybit and Paypal have withdrawn from the U.K. market whilst Binance has temporarily paused new U.K. sign-ups following the release of the FCA's promotions rule. Luno also blocked some customers from investing in crypto.  But geo-restrictions are rare for decentralized protocols, most of which do not require know-your-customer (KYC) checks.

42409551,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcKHlz,1698062587,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Gains as Trading Volume Surges,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin looked strong on Monday as the largest cryptocurrency by market value gained ground, rising just under 3% on the day. Bitcoin was trading around $30,600 at the time of writing. The rally comes as trading volumes have seen a surge. For centralized exchanges, the cumulative daily volume (based on a seven-day moving average) reached $16.24 billion from Oct. 16 to Oct. 22, according to a note from Matteo Greco, a research analyst at Fineqia. This is the third-highest trading volume recorded in the last 60 days, with the boost being primarily attributed to bitcoin trading, said Greco. Bitcoin’s total volume during this period was $6.4 billion, 68.4% more than the $3.8 billion recorded in the preceding week.  Hong Kong's financial regulator has relaxed earlier guidance that limited the sale of spot products to professional investors, allowing intermediaries to offer services to a wider range of clients. ""The policy is updated in light of the latest market developments and enquiries from the industry seeking to further expand retail access through intermediaries and to allow investors to directly deposit and withdraw virtual assets to/from intermediaries with appropriate safeguards,"" the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said in a circular on Friday. The change comes amid mounting interest in spot bitcoin exchange-traded-funds (ETFs). Recently, JPMorgan said the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. could happen within months, and probably before Jan. 10, the final deadline for the Ark 21Shares application. It also comes after the authority accused crypto exchange JPEX of operating without a license, making arrests, and saying it would publish details of licensed applicants. The catch here is that Hong Kong still wants to avoid overseas virtual-asset products because it considers them ""complex"" and therefore particularly risky.  The first coins ever floated as an experiment by the creator of the decentralized exchange Uniswap are now trading at more than $3 million per token (yes, that's not a typo), with a supply of just 4.4 tokens. The original tokens were released by Uniswap creator Hayden Adams in 2019, back when the exchange was in its very initial stages. While the first-ever coins to be seeded and traded on the platform were never intended to hold any value, and a large part of the supply was destroyed soon afterwards, a group of crypto traders stumbled upon some of the surviving tokens earlier in this month. They were able to acquire all 4.4 tokens available to the market – and called it HayCoin (HAY). The rest of the undestroyed tokens were held in a wallet owned by Adams. The limited supply helped boost the price of the open-market coins to hundreds of thousands of dollars shortly after being traded, giving a market capitalization of under $10 million. Adams, however, burned his stash on Saturday, effectively destroying 99.99% of the total supply and sending the price skyrocketing.  Chart of The Day  The chart shows changes in open interest in futures and perpetual futures tied to major cryptocurrencies in the past 24 hours.  Topping the list of gainers is DOGE, with a 17% gain, followed by XRP, SHIB, MATIC and BNB. Open interest in BTC has increased just 2%.  Increased inflow of money into meme cryptocurrencies often paves the way for price pullbacks.

42409540,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcKHBc,1698062400,Bitcoin Miner Bit Digital Diversifies Into AI for 'Substantially Higher Margin' Than Mining,"Bit Digital (BTBT) signed a deal with an AI firm that could generate more than $250 million in additional revenue over three years.  The miner said it will buy $35 million worth of GPUs to serve the AI client and has enough internal capital to fund the purchase.  The firm expects the new unit to generate enough cash for Bit Digital to sustain its current bitcoin mining and ether staking operations, regardless of where the market is headed.  Bitcoin miner Bit Digital (BTBT) is expanding into the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure business to diversify its revenue stream away from bitcoin [BTC] mining and ether [ETH] staking.  A new unit will buy and rent out computers to AI companies that require high-performance computing (HPC) for their operations, deploying the machines at a third-party data center, Bit Digital said in a statement on Monday.  Crypto miners are increasingly turning to AI and HPC-related businesses as the prolonged crypto winter batters their profits. The strategy is one way to add revenue immediately because those activities have the same requirements as mining: large data centers with infrastructures such as cooling systems, security and access to cheap energy.  The New York-based firm already has a client for the service: ""Bit Digital has entered into a binding term sheet to provide cloud-based GPU resources to a customer with an initial contract duration spanning one to three years,"" according to the statement.  The miner will rent out a minimum of 1,024 graphic processing units (GPU) and a maximum of 4,096 GPUs to the unidentified customer. The deal, at minimum, is expected to generate between $23 million and $27 million in annual revenue, starting January 2024. If extended to three years and with the maximum number of GPUs, the contract could generate more than $250 million of revenue, the mining firm said.  Bit Digital had revenue of about $9 million in the fiscal second quarter and $32 million for fiscal 2022.  To facilitate the deal, Big Digital will buy 132 units of FusionOne HPC from xFusion Digital Technologies – a global provider of digital infrastructure and services – for approximately $35 million. Each of the units includes Nvidia's HGX H100 8-GPUs, for a total of 1,056 GPUs, delivery of which is expected by year-end.  Bit Digital will finance the purchase with a mix of cash, digital assets on the balance sheet, new equity issuance and potentially equipment financing. The firm has already paid a deposit and has enough money on its balance sheet to fund the rest without raising additional capital, the miner told CoinDesk in an emailed statement. It will look for external funding if more GPUs are required.  The company had about $20.8 million of cash and $50.7 million worth of digital assets on its balance sheet as of Sept. 30.  'Substantially higher margins'  Bit Digital said the contract is expected to provide ""substantially higher margins"" than its existing bitcoin mining and ether staking operations, helping the company diversify its revenue stream.  In fact, the AI and HPC business margin is so much higher than mining alone that Bit Digital thinks its AI business will be able to help generate enough cash flow to cover the needs of its core business, regardless of where the bitcoin price is and with upcoming halving that would cut mining rewards in half.  ""This business line aims to provide a non-correlated income stream that will help the Company weather potential downturns in its core bitcoin mining and ETH staking businesses,"" CEO Sam Tabar said in the statement.  The company is not alone. Most recently, miner Hive Digital (HIVE) said it is converting 38,000 Nvidia GPU cards used to mine Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies into an on-demand GPU cloud service. The miner said its HPC and AI business is generating 15 times more revenue than bitcoin mining on a per-megawatt basis.  ""If the bitcoin price remains at current levels through the halving, we expect significant pain across the industry as margins are cut in half,"" Bit Digital told CoinDesk.  ""Having a reliable income stream in place that is uncorrelated to bitcoin prices will help us endure that potential downturn, and in turn allow us to be opportunistic and grow in a countercyclical fashion if the market mining-related assets become distressed,"" the firm added.

However, all hope is not lost. Despite its lackluster performance, market expert Ali Martinez has offered a glimmer of hope for DOGE enthusiasts. Martinez’s technical analysis, based on the TD Sequential indicator, has signaled a potential uptrend for Dogecoin. However, investors should approach these predictions with caution, as the market’s volatility remains a significant factor. #Dogecoin appears ready to start a new uptrend! The TD Sequential presented a buy signal on $DOGE weekly chart.

What Traders Should Know A Promising Signal For DOGE’s Weekly Chart In a recent analysis, Ali Martinez dissected Dogecoin’s price movements, highlighting a potential shift in its fortunes. His study pinpointed a promising buy signal on DOGE’s weekly chart, suggesting that the meme coin might be gearing up for an upward trajectory. The key to this potential breakthrough lies in DOGE’s ability to maintain a close above the $0.062 mark. If this level is sustained, it could trigger an upswing, propelling Dogecoin to reach $0.070, according to Martinez’s analysis. Currently, Dogecoin is valued at approximately $0.062736, as per CoinGecko. While it has recorded a 3.2% rally over the past 24 hours and a 4.0% surge in the last seven days, it still lags behind other cryptocurrencies that have witnessed more substantial gains during this period. Related Reading: Bitcoin Inches Away From Hitting $31,000 – How High Can BTC Go This Week? DOGE market cap currently at $8.97 Billion. Chart: TradingView.com Bullish Signals And Caution For DOGE Investors On the flip side, Martinez’s analysis also identifies potential risks for DOGE holders. Should the price of Dogecoin produce a daily candlestick close below the $0.0582 mark, it could establish a lower low, signaling a bearish trend. This could attract sellers and potentially lead to an 8.90% price drop, pushing DOGE down to $0.0550. Investors are urged to exercise caution as they navigate the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. While the weekend shows a bullish outlook for Dogecoin, it’s important to keep in mind that the start of a new week can reset existing market biases. With the crypto space constantly in flux, adopting a balanced and measured approach is imperative for those seeking to navigate the tumultuous terrain of digital assets. Dogecoin’s recent performance, while not as remarkable as other cryptocurrencies, has sparked optimism among some analysts like Ali Martinez. His technical analysis indicates the possibility of an upward trajectory if DOGE can maintain its position above the $0.062 mark. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice.

19264768,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=556584,1698057636,Mid-Term XRP Price Targets Revealed By Crypto Analyst,"Egrag, a crypto analyst, today presented his medium-term predictions for the XRP price on X (formerly Twitter). He backed up his projections with the 3-day chart and pointed out several potential price points that investors should watch out for. Analysis Of The 3-Day Chart XRP/USD Egrag’s chart, based on Binance’s 3-day XRP/USDT pair, suggests that XRP is currently in the midst of a crucial breakout retest phase. He emphasized the current market dynamics by saying, “What’s happening right now is merely a retest of the breakout; the true pump is still on the horizon, and it’s bound to be epic!” The analyst highlighted XRP’s triumphant rally from mid-July, which surpassed his original target of $0.85 and rose to a commendable $0.93, surpassing the original price target by 9.41%. Egrag’s 3-day chart shows a descending trend line, which the analyst calls the “Final Wake Up Line.” According to him, the breakout above the trend line on July 13 after the summary judgment in the lawsuit between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was the final wake-up call for investors who were still waiting on the sidelines. Currently, the XRP price sits at around $0.52. As the analyst shows in the chart, XRP has experienced a retest of the trend line and passed it with flying colors. In particular, Egrag also points out that XRP was able to stay above the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.4534. Related Reading: XRP Dominance Reveals Start Of Next Parabolic Price Move This laid the foundation for the XRP price to enter bullish territory at this point. However, the price still faces the resistance zone between $0.55 and $0.60, which Egrag calls the “backbone junction”. Noteworthy is that the upper end of the price range coincides with the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level. Exceeding this resistance is crucial, especially because it has provided strong resistance several times in the past. Once this is accomplished, Egrag’s medium-term XRP price targets will come into focus. As explained, he has made an adjustment to his price targets as a result of the July increase. Due to the 9.41%-higher July rise compared to his original price target, Egrag now expects XRP to rise to $1.10 (instead of $1) in an initial rally. Related Reading: XRP Price Set To Surge Amid Heightened Whale Accumulation Egrag has also raised the $5.5 price target to around $6, and the previous $6.4 benchmark has been recalibrated to nearly $7. He stated: So, if we apply this same percentage increase to our upcoming targets, here’s what we can look forward to: A) $1 * 9.41% = Approximately $1.10 B) $5.5 * 9.41% = Roughly $6 C) $6.4 * 9.41% = About $7 Lower Price Targets Egrag’s analysis is based on several Fibonacci levels and shows potential resistance points. These are the Fibonacci 0.5 ($0.7528), 0.618 ($0.9442), 0.702 ($1.1095), 0.786 ($1.3038), 1 ($1.9664), and the Fibonacci extension levels at 1.272 ($3.3153), 1.414 ($4.3546), and 1.618 ($6.4420). Overall, the analysis suggests that XRP’s upward momentum is likely to continue and build on its recent successes. The recent rise in price above the analyst’s lower target suggests robust upside sentiment in the market. However, investors should remain keenly aware of the crypto market’s inherent unpredictable nature and exercise due diligence at all times. Egrag ended his tweet on an encouraging note for the community, “XRP Army STAY STEADY, We’re advancing step by step towards our exciting targets.” At press time, XRP traded at $0.5291.

42409544,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcKHYl,1698055392,‘First Uniswap Token’ HayCoin Price Jumps to $3M Per Token,"The first coins ever floated as an experiment by the creator of the decentralized exchange Uniswap are now trading at more than $3 million per token (yes, that's not a typo), with a supply of just 4.4 tokens.  The original tokens were released by Uniswap creator Hayden Adams in 2019, back when the exchange was in its very initial stages. While first-ever coins to be seeded and traded on the platform were never intended to hold any value, and a large part of the supply was destroyed soon afterwards, a group of crypto traders stumbled upon some of the surviving tokens earlier in this month. They were able to acquire all 4.4 tokens available to the market – and called it HayCoin (HAY).  The rest of the undestroyed tokens were held in a wallet owned by Adams. The limited supply helped boost the price of the open-market coins to hundreds of thousands of dollars shortly after being traded, giving a market capitalization of under $10 million.  Adams, however, burned his stash on Saturday, effectively destroying 99.99% of the total supply. Burns are a way of permanently removing tokens from circulating supply by sending them to an address not controlled by anyone.  “Five years ago, before the launch of Uniswap v1, I deployed a token called HayCoin to use for testing,” he posted on X. “This was back when gas was so cheap that mainnet could be used as a testnet. After the launch of v1, I created a small test liquidity pool with a tiny fraction of the total supply and left the remainder in my wallet. I also used it to test the migration contract from Uniswap v1 to v2.”  “Over the years, a few people have noticed it and bought it as a joke/for the novelty of it. Ultimately, I’m uncomfortable owning almost the entire supply (~99.99%) of a token that people are memeing and speculating on,” he wrote.  Adam’s action means the 4.4 tokens are the only ones remaining of first Uniswap cons, which some crypto investors may attach a nostalgic value to, akin to a digital relic. Prices surged to as much as $4.4 million apiece Sunday, before settling above the $3 million mark on Monday.  Traders can purchase a fraction of these tokens, similar to any other cryptocurrency, but Adams remains generally unimpressed.  “To be extremely clear, I will have no future involvement, have burned all the HAY in my wallet, and think speculating on it is silly,” he wrote.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | UNI,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/23/first-uniswap-token-haycoin-price-jumps-to-3m-per-token,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7cb697e8f66775d5ebc70087f60688d11a9ec8e2-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409535,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcKGrm,1698055200,The Sam Bankman-Fried Trial: It’s the Courthouse Life for Us,"New York’s hottest courtroom is SDNY 26A.  Located in a heavily guarded skyscraper near the Financial District, this four-day-a-week perp party is the creation of alleged crypto fraudster Sam “your money’s gone!” Bankman-Fried.  You're reading The SBF Trial, a CoinDesk newsletter bringing you daily insights from inside the courtroom where Sam Bankman-Fried will try to stay out of prison. Want to receive it directly? Sign up here.  This place has everything: Reporters, washed-up television stars, a U.S. Marshal who looks like a hunky John Cleese – and that’s just the gallery! Test Judge Lewis Kaplan’s patience and his hair-thinning henchman Andy will give you a verbal spanking.  Look who’s at the witness stand: Is that Sam? We’ll find out soon.  Whimsical comments aside, the month-long trial of Sam Bankman-Fried has indeed turned into a marquee social gathering for the journalists and general onlookers who fight every morning for a seat.  There are two layers to the insanity: the main courtroom and overflow. Top-floor warriors get there before 7:30 a.m. ET for one of the handful of top bench seats the Marshals arbitrarily dole out. Everyone else gets funneled to overflow, a few floors down.  CoinDesk’s trial team has learned the secrets of both. Court is in recess until Thursday, so today we’ll give you a peek behind the curtain.  We’ll start with the courtroom itself. The wood-paneled chamber has three pews reserved for the general public, which is usually composed of reporters. There are at least seven other benches earmarked for in-house reporters, sketch artists, lawyers, friends of the court and family of the defendant, as well as the prosecutors.  In front of the gallery is Sam’s table. During court he’s usually flanked by his attorneys, Mark Cohen and Chris Everdell, and always with two Marshals directly behind him. The next few tables are prosecutors’, followed by court staff and then the bench itself, where Judge Kaplan sits. To their right is the witness stand and the jury box.  Attendees begin filing in around 9:00 a.m. ET. As long as they stay on the Marshals' good side, members of the general public retain their seats until close at 4:30 p.m. ET. But there’s plenty of ways to screw up. Don’t chew gum, don’t use cell phones, don’t read newspapers, don’t rip vapes, don’t wear hats and DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT TALKING. All of these infractions can result in eviction and banishment to overflow.  Assuming you 1. Do get in, and 2. Don’t get booted, you have the best seat possible to watch this drama unfold. I recommend watching the jurors’ faces.  – Danny Nelson  Down below, the overflow room is far more relaxed than the main courtroom. Attendees can enter and exit as they need to to file updates (hi!), use the restroom or grab a snack from the cafeteria. People laugh when the judge makes a joke and swap rumors about whether Bankman-Fried will take the stand for his own defense (seems more likely than not).  The jury boxes – there are two in the overflow room, because a second one was built to let jurors distance from each other during COVID, a Marshal told me – have computer monitors that let the gallery see what's happening in the main courtroom. This includes two camera feeds that let us view the attorneys and witnesses, as well as a section dedicated to court exhibits.  Still, there are some key similarities. People watching one of Judge Kaplan's cases – courtroom or overflow – are not allowed to have their phones on them. Even attorneys with passes that might ordinarily allow them to retain their devices have to turn them in.  The only exceptions are the in-house court reporters – journalists who cover the court regularly and are able to work from a separate press room elsewhere in the building.  — Nikhilesh De  What we're expecting  No filings came this weekend. The next deadline to watch for is Monday, when the defense will put forward proposals for any expert witnesses to rebut testimony from the prosecution's case.  The defense originally proposed seven expert witnesses. The judge blocked three from testifying entirely, and the remainder need to file complete disclosures before he'll okay them. Of those, one – University of Michigan Assistant Professor Andrew Di Wu – will not be called, as he was proposed as a rebuttal witness to Compass Lexecon Executive Vice President Andria van der Merwe, who ended up not testifying.  That leaves three possible expert witnesses: Thomas Bishop, Brian Kim and Joseph Pimbley.  Bishop is a consultant who might cover financial figures and calculations. Kim may testify about document metadata, and Pimbley about FTX's codebase, according to previous court filings.  These aren't the only witnesses who may be called, to be clear – the defense may have other, non-expert witnesses. It's unclear whether those names would show up in the public court docket, though they may be being shared privately among the parties and judge.  — Nikhilesh De",NEUTRAL,없음,REGULATION,"Danny Nelson, Nikhilesh De",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/23/the-sam-bankman-fried-trial-its-the-courthouse-life-for-us,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/84d3ca7ee2a1134decf42c38bcf6e637ea645d1f-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409541,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcKHIE,1698054070,"Hong Kong Reverses Stance on Spot-Crypto, ETF Investing, With a Catch","Hong Kong's financial regulator has extended earlier guidance that limited the sale of spot products to professional investors, allowing intermediaries to offer services to wider range of clients.  ""The policy is updated in light of the latest market developments and enquiries from the industry seeking to further expand retail access through intermediaries and to allow investors to directly deposit and withdraw virtual assets to/from intermediaries with appropriate safeguards,"" the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said in a circular on Friday.  The change in regulation comes amid mounting interest in spot bitcoin exchange-traded-funds (ETFs). Recently, JPMorgan said the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. could happen within months, and probably before Jan. 10, the final deadline for the Ark 21Shares application. It also comes after the authority accused crypto exchange JPEX of operating without a license, making arrests, and saying it would publish details of licensed applicants.  The catch here is that Hong Kong still wants to avoid overseas virtual-asset (VA) products because it considers them ""complex"" and therefore particularly risky.  ""VA-related products which are considered complex products should only be offered to professional investors,"" the circular said. ""For example, an overseas VA non-derivative ETF would very likely be considered a complex product.""  The other catch is that potential clients would need to take a one-off test to determine their investing knowledge and ensure they have sufficient net worth to assume the risks related to virtual asset trading. Intermediaries would also need to provide clients with risk disclosure statements.  Hong Kong's ambitions to become a virtual asset hub became apparent when it implemented a new regulatory regime in June, accepting applications for crypto trading platform licenses. It granted the first set of licenses in August, allowing exchanges to serve retail customers. That was a U-turn after 18 months of hostility toward crypto.

19262672,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=556590,1698053421,Crypto Analyst Points Out Bitcoin Sell Signal That Could Be Triggered Today,"The flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is fast approaching $31,000 following its gains over the weekend. Analyzing this price action, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has predicted Bitcoin’s future trajectory as he suggests that the bears could regain dominance soon enough. A Price Correction Imminent For Bitcoin In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Martinez noted the potential head-and-shoulders pattern that was forming on the Bitcoin daily chart following its upward trend. This chart pattern has always been considered bearish as it suggests that a trend reversal might be on the horizon, meaning there could be a dip in prices soon enough. Source: X Confirming this assumption, Martinez stated that the daily chart (which he shared alongside the post) “hints at a possible sell signal emerging tomorrow [October 23].” According to him, this prediction is backed by the TD Sequential indicator, which is flashing “a green 9 candlestick.” The TD Sequential indicator helps traders identify the exact time of a potential reversal. Martinez also alluded to the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which he mentioned has reached 74.21. He noted that this has been “a level triggering sharp corrections since March.” An RSI of over 70 also suggests that Bitcoin may be overbought with a price correction imminent. This impending price correction can only be averted if Bitcoin manages to clock “a daily candlestick close above $31,560.” As of the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $30,700, up by over 2% in the last twenty-four hours and a further 10% in the last seven days. Options Market Could Contribute To Bitcoin’s Upward Momentum In a post on his X platform, Alex Thorn, Head of Firmwide Research, highlighted the role that options traders (short gammas in particular) could play in driving Bitcoin’s price higher in the short term. Source: X He noted that the options market makers in Bitcoin are “increasingly short gamma as BTC spot price moves up.” This current positioning could help “amplify the explosiveness of any short-term upward move in the near term,” considering that these short gammas have to buy more Bitcoin to stay “delta neutral” as Bitcoin’s price continues to rise. From his analysis, Thorn was simply explaining that the option market makers will have to place ‘buy orders’ to hedge against their short positions as Bitcoin’s price continues to climb, thereby adding to buying pressure, which could cause the crypto’s price to rise higher. Meanwhile, he believes that the long gammas could provide a safety net for Bitcoin’s price in the event of a price reversal. These long gammas would have to buy back spots in order to remain delta-neutral, thereby providing support and helping resist any further decline (in the short term, at least).

To achieve this, the majority of the WLD token supply will be given to new and existing users in the form of user grants over the years to come.”  Worldcoin is an identity protocol backed by OpenAI founder Sam Altman. The protocol uses a hardware unit known as an Orb to identify individuals and prove they are human by scanning their irises – which the company says will ultimately benefit the broader crypto and artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystems as they are integrated into society.  Users verified by the Orb can claim WLD tokens on the project’s app, where regulations allow, while Orb operators were paid for in USDC tokens per iris scan. It is unclear how much these operators make per scan.

The Speaker of the House runs the House of Representatives, scheduling votes and moving legislation. Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) took on the role earlier this year, but was ousted earlier this month. Democrat Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was the previous Speaker, until her party lost the majority in the 2022 election.  An individual familiar with the matter told CoinDesk that Emmer, who's currently the majority whip – meaning he's the second-highest ranking member of the House Republican caucus – was making calls for the Speaker on Friday.  Emmer has sponsored legislation that would create crypto-specific definitions for how tokens might fit into existing securities frameworks, as well as to block the issuance of a central bank digital currency. He's signed onto letters and other initiatives similarly pushing clarity for the crypto industry.

Two candidates have already failed to secure enough votes to win the speakership – Congressmen Steve Scalise (R-La.) and Jim Jordan (R-Ohio). Jordan's bid ended earlier Friday after he lost a third vote in the House (and then a secret caucus vote). A handful of other lawmakers are also running for the position, though the House won't vote on any other candidates until next week.

In a flurry of messages, Kusama unveiled his enthusiasm and strategic engagements aimed at bolstering Shiba Inu’s ecosystem. “Excited to see ALL the incredible projects on Shibarium. Finally, get to come out of quiet mode for all the amazing projects out there,” he said, delineating the ongoing work and collaborations undertaken during his period of silence. He further revealed dialogues with pivotal figures in the ecosystem, saying, “I’ve been talking to VERY important individuals and some top [people] in [the] community for the next phase. Now I can return and support in any way I can as we keep building.” Kusama’s remarks suggest a phase of introspection and strategic alignments, as he mentioned, “We have also been busy with platforms to support the community and begin this network state. Sometimes silence is the best weapon.” Major Progress For Shiba Inu, Leash, Shibarium One of the most significant updates provided was regarding the LEASH token. Kusama outlined a vision where the community is more involved and informed. “Yes. My plan is to build a framework that expresses to the community what YOUR plans, products, and platforms that use leash are… so we all can DOOR. (DYOR) Good plan huh?” he commented, emphasizing the essence of decentralization. “This is the quiet before the typhoon and I can’t wait to learn about all the fantastic projects building with Leash, Shib, Bone or launching on Shibarium.” Related Reading: New SHIB-Based Token On The Way? Shiba Inu Team Member Shares Important Update On the matter of Shibarium’s low usage, Kusama imparted his perspective on broader market trends and token utility. Explaining the relationship between token “burns” and utility, he noted, “Please understand the ‘burn’ increases as the use of Shibarium and Shib (and all tokens in the ecosystem) increase. So I’ve been looking for ways at a zoomed-out level to increase usage with others in our decentralized community.” Kusama also addressed the community’s queries about specific timelines for key developments, advocating for a broader, philosophical perspective on time, indicating that rigid timelines might not be the most effective approach in a complex and evolving ecosystem. He stated, “Because time is infinite. It cannot be framed. BUT if you’re into watches the waves of the world then you know what time it is.” Related Reading: Shiba Inu Revival? Here’s Why A Resurgence May Be Imminent A question regarding Shiba Inu’s integration into mainstream payment systems like McDonald’s and Burger King was met with a pragmatic response, acknowledging the existing challenges in such integrations. “It is available in tens of thousands of retailers but payment systems require deeper thought and integration,” Kusama elucidated, hinting at ongoing strategic deliberations. A noteworthy exchange occurred when a user mentioned the necessity for the Shibarium key for integration with Hoichi, highlighting the importance of community-driven initiatives. The Shiba Inu-based project stated that they “have 30 blockchains active already waiting to connect with Shibarium,” but the key is missing. “I think the Shibarium team reached out and there was confusion on what was needed. Please reach out a second time,” Kusama advised. At press time, SHIB traded at $0.00000722. Remarkably, SHIB managed to close above the neckline of the descending triangle on the weekly chart, which could create a new bullish momentum. The next target could be the descending trend line of the triangle.

On Tuesday at 13:02 EST (17:02 UTC), Reddit shuttered community points – a blockchain-based internet points program designed to reward creators and developers – citing scalability issues. The program allowed users to earn and spend community points through native tokens like MOON.  Roughly 30 minutes before the announcement, moderators, with the insider information of the impending news, sold 456,353 MOON, then worth $92,000, according to data tracked by onchain sleuth Lookonchain. Another large tranche of 363,227 MOON hit the market two minutes before the announcement, adding to the selling pressure.  MOON, an ERC-20 token, is distributed as a reward to users for their posts or comments in the r/CryptoCurrency subreddit and can be freely traded, tipped, or spent in the community for different purposes. The token fell over 85% to $0.0198 on the back of the Reddit announcement.  Moderators were informed of Reddit's impending decision one hour in advance, as per the r/CryptoCurrencyMoons subreddit. The episode highlights challenges in policing cryptocurrency markets.  The insider trading enraged many in the investor community, with some calling for regulatory action against moderators while others raising question marks on Reddit’s decision to inform moderators in advance.  “Those who sold before the announcement should be reported to the SEC. Removing ones self isn't an acceptable outcome for insider trading,” Bucksaway03said.  ""At least everyone would have been on the same playing field if Reddit just blindsided everyone, including the mods,"" Lord-Nagafensaid.

6857,http://blokt.com/?p=51482,1698048006,Social Engineering: A Major Threat to Your Privacy,"Protecting your privacy takes more than running a privacy-oriented Linux distro and using a password manager . Many security experts believe the weakest link in any system is the human that operates it. In this article, we’ll learn what social engineering is and why it is such a threat. Then we’ll look at some of the social engineering attacks that bad guys can use against you, both online and offline. We wrap it up with a few tips for protecting yourself from social engineering attacks. What is Social Engineering? Merriam-Webster defines social engineering as the “ management of human beings in accordance with their place and function in society.” That sounds a little creepy in itself. But in recent years, the phrase has taken on a more manipulative, sinister meaning. Today, social engineering means something like “ manipulating people to give you confidential information.” When we talk about social engineering here, this is the sense that we’re using. Why Social Engineering is Such a Threat Criminals use social engineering because it is easier than hacking into a computer system. Tricking someone into telling you something they shouldn’t is relatively easy. Most people are trusting of others. It doesn’t matter how secure your computer system is. Or where you stashed your personal documents. Or how many guards are in front of your offices. Social engineering attacks sidestep all that. Famous ex-hacker Kevin Mitnick often used social engineering attacks to get into “secure” computer systems. “Anyone who thinks that security products alone offer true security is settling for the illusion of security.” – Kevin D. Mitnick , The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security Criminals use social engineering attacks, both online and offline. Now we’ll look at some of the most common types of attacks and what you can do to defend yourself against them. We will start with online social engineering attacks that hackers love. You may have come across some of these before. “A hacker is someone who uses a combination of high-tech cyber tools and social engineering to gain illicit access to someone else’s data.” – John McAfee Some Online Social Engineering Attacks Here are a few of the most common online social engineering attacks: Phishing Spear Phishing Baiting Phishing According to the Department of Homeland Security website , a phishing attack “uses email or malicious websites to solicit personal information by posing as a trustworthy organization.” You’ve seen this kind of attack. We all get emails from official-sounding organizations claiming there’s a problem with our account, or they need to verify our credit card information. The goal is to get you to click on the link in the email. That link will take you to a legitimate-looking, but phony, website for the organization. The website will be set up to trick you into entering your credit card data, Social Security number, or whatever it is that the crooks want to steal. Spear Phishing Spear phishing is a type of phishing attack where the attacker customizes the phishing email using personal information about the intended victim. In December 2018, the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) published a warning about several spear-phishing scams. These scams were meant to gather the information that goes on IRS Form W-2 . The target for these scams was small businesses. The bad guys would use the information to open credit card accounts, file fraudulent tax returns, open lines of credit, and so on. Spear phishing attacks rely heavily on Pretexting attacks. We cover Pretexting attacks in the next section. Baiting Baiting attacks are somewhat similar to phishing attacks. The difference is that baiting attacks offer the target something they want instead of resolve a problem. In these kinds of attacks, you might get offered free music, copies of new movies, or any other kind of prize. To get the prize, you would be required to enter whatever type of personal information it is that the crook is after. Baiting attacks can also occur offline. One such attack involves leaving USB sticks lying around somewhere employees of a target company might find them. The chances are good that someone will pick one up and plug it into their computer, letting whatever malicious software it contains loose inside the organization. Some Offline Social Engineering Attacks Online isn’t the only place you are vulnerable to social engineering attacks, here are some examples of offline techniques. Pretexting Tailgating/Piggybacking Vishing (Voice Phishing) Pretexting Pretexting is using some form of a lie to trick someone into giving up information they should not share. Pretexting attacks can be run both online and offline. They are often used to get the personal information needed to set up Spear Phishing attacks. An offline example might be someone who calls you, pretending to be from a lawyer’s office. You’ve just inherited a lot of money from a distant relative. All you need to do is provide certain information to prove your identity, and the lawyer will wire you the money. The pretext for the call is the phony inheritance. Tailgating/Piggybacking Tailgating usually involves passing through some sort of electronic security system using someone else’s access. Someone following close behind you when you pass through electronic security might not be a fellow employee at all. Instead, they might be someone tailgating on your access to go somewhere they don’t belong. Vishing (Voice Phishing) Vishing, or Voice Phishing , is the offline equivalent of a Phishing attack. There are several versions of this attack, but all use the telephone system. They aim to get the victim to divulge a credit card number or some other personal information in response to an official-sounding phone call. These scams usually use VoIP (Voice over IP) technology to simulate the automated phone system that a real company might use. Phone systems used to be considered safe and trustworthy, making people more vulnerable to Vishing scams. How to Defend Yourself from ONLINE Social Engineering Attacks We’ve looked at some of the more common online social engineering attacks in use today. But what can you do to protect yourself from them? Here are some practices that will reduce your chance of getting scammed: Don’t open unexpected email attachments . If you receive an unexpected attachment, the chances are good that it is malicious. Contact the company IT department (if at work). If not at work, contact the sender (if you know them). Find out why you received it before opening any unexpected attachment. Look up websites on your own. Remember that phishing-type attacks usually direct you to a fake website. You can avoid their trap by looking up the website address yourself rather than clicking on a link in an email message or attachment. If you do find yourself on a website you are unsure about, check out the URL (the address) that appears in the browser address box. While it is possible to make an exact duplicate of a legitimate website, no two sites can have the same URL. Looking up the company in a search engine should get you to the real site. Never reveal your password to anyone online. No legitimate organization is going to ask a user for their password. Use a VPN for additional privacy when browsing the web. How to Defend Yourself from OFFLINE Social Engineering Attacks We’ve also looked at common offline social engineering attacks. Here are some things you can do to protect yourself from offline attacks: Don’t give personal information to callers. This may have been safe many years ago, but is not now. If someone calls you and says they need you to confirm some personal information, hang up on the creeps! Don’t let anyone tailgate you to get past security. Regular criminals or ex-employees have been known to use this technique to get back onsite and steal things or exact vengeance. Always demand an ID from anyone who shows up asking you for information. Never plug anything into your computer if you don’t know where it came from!

What Traders Should Know,"Solana (SOL) has been making waves in the cryptocurrency market with an impressive price performance since the beginning of 2023. The digital currency has recorded a staggering 195% increase in its value during this period, leaving traders and investors eager to know whether this rally can be sustained in the months to come. From its humble beginnings at $9.97, the price of SOL has rapidly ascended to nearly $30 in the span of just 10 months. At the time of writing, SOL is valued at $30.72 at CoinGecko, boasting impressive 24-hour gains of 3.6% and an astonishing seven-day rally of 38.9%. Technical analysts are cautiously optimistic about SOL’s future trajectory. They suggest that under the right conditions, SOL could potentially double in value. According to a recent price analysis report, the coin might appreciate to $32, although this uptrend is expected to proceed at a more measured pace compared to the aggressive pump witnessed in July. SOL price action in the last week. Source: Coingecko Recent price action at around $30 certainly raises questions about SOL’s potential to reach $32, but many factors remain in play. What’s undeniable is that Solana’s impressive performance relative to major cryptocurrencies makes it an asset worth watching closely. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaches Halfway Mark To $31,000 – How High Can BTC Go This Week? Solana Key Levels And Potential Scenarios If SOL’s upward momentum continues, there are several notable price targets to watch for. The key resistance levels to keep an eye on are at $30, $32, $33.8, and $37.4. If the cryptocurrency manages to break through these levels, it could signal a sustained bullish trend, and investors may consider these points as potential areas for profit-taking or reassessment of their positions. Alternatively, if selling pressure prevails in the near future, SOL could decline to the crucial support at $24, indicating a potential shift in the trend. Keep an eye on $24 as a significant level for decision-making. Related Reading: Solana On Fire With Over 34% Rally Within A Week – Details SOL market cap currently at $12.956 billion. Chart: TradingView.com A Promising Breakthrough In a separate report, it is highlighted that Solana has successfully overcome the $25.86 hurdle after nearly a year of struggling to do so. This achievement serves as a testament to the strength of the bullish sentiment within the SOL market. However, investors should be prepared for a potential minor pullback to $25.86 or $24.43 as part of the ongoing price action. A rebound from these levels is crucial for kickstarting a rally with the ambitious target of $69.79 in sight. Solana’s impressive run so far in 2023 has not gone unnoticed. With technical indicators and support levels in play, traders and investors should keep a keen eye on SOL, as it navigates its way through the volatile crypto landscape, offering both opportunities and risks in the quest for substantial gains.

The leading cryptocurrency by market value rose to $30,797 during Monday’s Asian trading hours, reaching the highest since July 15, according to CoinDesk data.  Prices are up 14% for the month, with gold registering a much lesser 6.7% gain. Gold, however, picked up a bid a week before bitcoin, as the outbreak of tensions between Israel and Hamas, alongside continued speculation about the end of the Fed tightening cycle, signaled an inflationary regime ahead.  “Rates are the biggest mover in macro right now, but surprisingly, rate-sensitive assets, such as Gold, are also seeing bullish momentum… this bodes well for BTC,” Greg Magdini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said in an email.  Magadini added that war spending is traditionally inflationary, and the Fed is simultaneously hinting about a pause in rate hikes at a time when the U.S. economy remains robust. This favors the upside in gold and BTC, considering the spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) optimism.  “BTC remains an even more interesting asset, given perfect-portability, inflation hedge, and government agnostic wealth preservation. Combine the optimism around the BTC ETF and the Ripple lawsuit, and altogether, this strikes me as a very bullish development for BTC as a whole,” Magadini noted.  Analysts at Blockware Solutions voiced a similar opinion while attributing the rally to the potential approval of an exchange-traded fund that tracks the spot price of bitcoin.  “Price action is behaving quite constructively as investors seek the life raft the Bitcoin network provides in times of economic and geopolitical uncertainty, and speculate on the future of BTC pending an approved spot ETF,” Blockware noted.  According to Alex Thorn, Head of Firmwide Research, the way options market makers are positioned indicates scope for an explosive move to the higher side.  Per Thorn, market makers are holding net short gamma exposure, which forces them to buy high and sell low as the market moves. They do so to adjust their overall exposure back to neutral, inadvertently adding to price volatility.  “Options market makers in bitcoin are increasingly short gamma as BTC spot price moves up. When you’re short gamma and spot px rises, you need to buy back spot to stay delta neutral. This should amplify the explosiveness of any short-term upward move in the near term,” Thorn said on X.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/23/bitcoin-eyes-31k-as-gold-offers-bullish-cues,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1a52f0c86dc2ebd268cfa73bf0e8a238e857d727-1723x969.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

There is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,645 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could climb further higher, but it might face strong resistance near $1,750. Ethereum Price Reclaims $1,650 Ethereum stayed above the $1,550 support zone. The recent pump in Bitcoin above the $28,500 resistance sparked bullish moves in ETH. There was a steady increase above the $1,600 and $1,620 resistance levels. The price even cleared the key $1,650 resistance zone. A high is formed near $1,700 and the price is now consolidating gains.
