42422500,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0lUth,1661634871,"Grayscale, Disclosing SEC Queries, Says Cryptos XLM, ZEC, ZEN May Be Securities","Grayscale Investments LLC has been fielding questions from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the firm’s “securities law analysis” of tokens in some of its less-popular crypto trusts.  The inquiry, which Grayscale disclosed in little-noticed filings made in June and mid-August, casts a shadow over the trusts’ viability at a time when the world’s largest digital asset manager is already dealing with a precipitous decline in its assets’ value due to the ongoing crypto winter.  The disclosures appear in filings for trusts containing the native cryptocurrencies of the Stellar (XLM), Zcash (ZEC) and Horizen (ZEN) blockchains. In the filings, Grayscale said it was “responding” to SEC staff from the Division of Corporate Finance as well as Enforcement, the investigations wing that recently doubled down on policing crypto.  Grayscale did not immediately answer CoinDesk’s request for comment.  The SEC’s questions highlight uncertainty for Grayscale’s lineup of brokerage account-friendly crypto trusts. It also speaks to an ever-more aggressive regulator determined to crack down on tokens it believes should be subject to U.S. securities law.  Grayscale pitches crypto trusts to traditional investors as an easy way to invest in crypto tokens alongside stocks and bonds. Grayscale, which like CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, holds billions of dollars worth of assets in these trusts, the most popular being those for bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH).  ZEC, ZEN and XLM combined for only $40 million of Grayscale’s roughly $18.7 billion assets under management from funds and trusts, making them small outposts in an empire that itself used to be far larger. Grayscale held around $60 billion amid last November’s market peak, before the value plummeted with the rest of the crypto markets.  Though relatively minor trusts, any uncertainty surrounding this trio’s legal status – namely, whether they are securities – underscores the stakes of Grayscale’s regulatory gamble. Its trust business presumes these cryptos are not securities; if it determines otherwise, it says in the filings, it may have to pull the plug on the trusts.  Read more: Grayscale Sues SEC Over Bitcoin ETF Application Rejection  For the first time in August, Grayscale acknowledged that ZEC, ZEN and XLM “may currently be a security, based on the facts as they exist today,” a major shift from its May and June stance that the trio might be deemed so down the road.  Other changes between Grayscale’s June and August filings further suggest a rapidly evolving situation for ZEC’s, ZEN’s and XLM’s treatment by the SEC.  In the June 28 filings, where Grayscale first reveals the regulatory back and forth, the asset manager says “SEC staff has not provided any guidance as to the security status of” ZEN, ZEC and XLM.  That line does not appear in the Aug. 16 filings.  Another addition in the Aug. 16 filings: Grayscale “has received a memorandum regarding the status of [ZEN, ZEC and XLM] under the federal securities laws from its external securities lawyers.” The disclosures do not detail what that memo says.  ZEC's inclusion among the assets potentially viewed as securities by the SEC surprised crypto lawyer Gabriel Shapiro, who found the agency's apparent interpretation ominously expansive.

The &apos;taker buy/sell volume&apos; is an indicator that measures the Bitcoin long and short volumes on derivatives exchanges. The metric distinguishes between these two volumes based on whether the transaction occurs at the ask price (taker buy) or the bid price (taker sell). When these volumes are high, it means the exchanges are receiving a large amount of orders right now. This kind of trend usually leads to higher volatility in the price of the crypto.

Returns and volatility correlations between cryptos and Asian stocks were low before the pandemic but they increased significantly since 2020, sparked by easy access to cheap borrowing via low interest rates alongside government stimulus payments. The return correlations of bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Indian stock markets, for example, have surged by 10-fold over the pandemic, &apos;suggesting limited risk diversification benefits of crypto,&apos; the IMF wrote. For some context, bitcoin (BTC-USD), the largest digital token by market cap, experienced a wild rally from the start of the pandemic to its November 2021 peak. During that time, its price jumped by over 1,000% to an all-time high of $68.9K. But as central banks like the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank tighten monetary policy to bring down inflationary pressures, bitcoin lost a big chunk of those gains, now up 302% to $20.64K as of Friday afternoon.

Disclosing the news of the searches on Thursday, the Bangalore cell of India's Enforcement Directorate told CoinDesk, ""Searches were conducted since we did not receive the desired cooperation from CoinSwitch Kuber.""  Two days later, the CEO of the exchange took to Twitter, apparently seeking to clarify that the ""engagement with the ED"" is not about money laundering or India's Prevention of Money Laundering Act. In its earlier report, CoinDesk said the searches were in connection with India's Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA). In his Twitter thread, Singhal did not state what prompted the searches.  CoinSwitch didn't immediately respond to a request for further comment.  ""Cryptos are not yet clearly classified in most parts of the world,"" Singhal tweeted, seeking to explain his crypto platform's position. ""Now, the law (in India and elsewhere) is still assessing if crypto is a “commodity,” “security,” “currency” or something new. This is a work in progress. CoinSwitch Kuber is committed to building a responsible crypto ecosystem that contributes to the Indian Economy.""

SushiSwap&apos;s initial plan included a base income of 800,000 USDC and 600,000 vested SUSHI tokens, as well as other incentives. The community strongly opposed the initial idea and the financial incentives. The very first sentence of the new proposal made this issue clear. The language of the most recent proposal, which community leader Tangle shared, reads: &apos;The community has expressed concerns around incorporating both the compensation and the candidate together into one proposal.&apos; Thanks to this division, the community would have greater freedom to agree on the compensation without having to vote against the bigger proposal. The initial rewards included price target bonuses for the new hire, which, if kept up for a year, would total more than $10 million. Reduction Of Base Wage A new incentive structure approved today will reduce the base wage to 500,000 USDC. The total number of SUSHI tokens for the incentive system will also be decreased from 1.2 million to 1 million. The primary cause of the dispute was a vote to retain the current pricing goal ranges, approved by a 53% to 47% split between the 40 voters. Also, a second vote will take place on the already confirmed new hiring to ensure community agreement.

Will the increased fear in the global market bring Bitcoin below this year&apos;s low of $17600? With the 6% drop last night, the Bitcoin (BTC) prices plunge to the crucial support of $20K. And the increased supply warns of a further downfall to the $18,850 mark. So will this high-momentum selling spree result in a drop to $15K, or will the price bounce back from the $18,850 mark? Key Points: The BTC price action displays a bearish engulfing candle completing a post-retest reversal from the $21,875 resistance level.
