42380999,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93Bnl,1531429516,New Power Rates Approved for Crypto Miners in Upstate New York,"A municipal utility provider in New York got the green light from state regulators to create a new set of electricity rates for cryptocurrency miners.  The move by the The New York State Public Service Commission was announced Thursday, allowing the Massena Electric Department to ""allow high-density load customers, such as cryptocurrency companies, to qualify for service under an individual service agreement.""  While primarily an administrative move, it's a potentially significant development for cryptocurrency miners hoping to tap the hydroelectrical resources located in New York.  A senior official for the commission said that the decision was based on a desire to balance the need to charge ""fair"" rates while also attracting business to the region.  Commission chairman John Rhodes said in a statement:  ""We must ensure that business customers pay a fair price for the electricity that they consume. However, given the abundance of low-cost electricity in upstate New York, there is an opportunity to serve the needs of existing customers and to encourage economic development in the region.""  The newly approved rule will allow any electricity customers with a maximum demand of electricity over 300 kilowatt-hours to qualify for service under a negotiated contract. The contracts will be reviewed by Massena's municipal utility and must ""protect existing customers from increased supply costs resulting from the new service.""  Thursday's move wasn't the first of its kind out of the Commission – earlier this year, the body approved a bid to levy miners with higher rates in the form of a new tariff.  The decision came in response to a petition filed by the New York Municipal Power Agency (NYMPA), which expressed concern that local residents may experience higher rates due to the higher-than-average consumption rates of miners.

42380994,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93BhT,1531425613,Lawmakers to Discuss If Crypto Is 'The Future of Money' Next Week,"Cryptocurrencies will take center stage once again on Capitol Hill next week.  The U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee announced Thursday that it would host a hearing titled ""The Future of Money: Digital Currency"" on Wednesday, July 18.  Though the Committee, headed by Chairman Jeb Hensarling, has yet to announce a full list of participating witnesses, CoinDesk confirmed that the event will be livestreamed on its website.  Past hearings by the Committee have seen lawmakers discuss cryptocurrencies through the lenses of terrorism financing and fraudulent investments, as previously reported by CoinDesk.  That being said, it seems the topic of next week's hearing is more geared towards debating the utility of cryptocurrencies as a form of money.  It is a timely topic in light of an increasing interest in cryptocurrencies as a potentially useful monetary tool for governments and more specifically, central banks, around the world. In March, the Bank of International Settlements, what some consider as the central bank to central banks, argued cryptocurrencies backed by central banks could in fact fuel faster bank runs during periods of financial instability.  Other countries including Canada, Finland and South Korea have weighed in on the matter, though responses have been mixed with trepidation.

42380986,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93BZv,1531422022,Korean Government-Backed Researchers File for Blockchain Patent,"A South Korean government-funded organization has submitted a blockchain-related patent application to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), public documents show.  The application, which was submitted by the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI) on January 10 of this year, details a blockchain-powered system for managing data that belongs to public organizations.  More specifically, the system, fueled by a number of servers, would record the financial transaction history of a public organization on a blockchain. To boost the system's reliability, a third-party server is also introduced to the structure as it does ""a mathematical operation.""  At the heart of the concept is an effort to boost transparency around information tied to public organizations.  As the application explains:  ""An income history or an expenditures history of the public organizations that enforce the national budget and non-profit organizations that raise donations needs to be transparently managed. However, even though there are many possibilities that the server may be attacked or manipulated/tampered internally, it is difficult for ordinary citizens or donors to know the income history and the expenditures history of public organizations.""  Alongside the U.S. patent, ETRI submitted a similar application to the Korean Intellectual Property Office in January 2017.  The application is a notable example of a government-funded organization moving to obtain patent rights around an application of blockchain.  ETRI, according to its official site, was founded in 1976 and is one of the most elite research organizations in the field of telecommunication in South Korea. It's also an active patent-seeker, its published data shows, with more than 10,000 patent applications submitted thus far.

42380981,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93BW9,1531411550,Report: More Than Three-Quarters of ICOs Were Scams,"About half of the existing crypto-asset market today – numbering some 1,500 – functions on top of an existing blockchain like ethereum, according to a new report.  The study  from Satis Group, which forms part of a five-entry series analyzing the state of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, explores the state of what it calls ""platform networks,"" honing on ethereum as well as other blockchains like NEO, EOS and Cardano, among others.  In looking at the ""market share"" of those platforms, it's perhaps not surprising that ethereum constitutes the bulk of that figure – some 86 percent – followed by Waves at 2.9 percent and NEO at 2.3 percent.  Whether that state of affairs will change is an open question, and Satis Group outlines a number of advantages in ethereum's corner as it stands today.  ""It remains to be seen whether any platform will be able to surpass Ethereum's adoption, which has a high degree of first mover advantage (nearly a three-year head start, plus the entire market share of the ICO discovery phase through 2017) in addition to high levels of community support, liquidity, and developer buy in,"" the report states, adding:  ""Emerging platforms have been able to differentiate themselves with higher levels of transaction throughput (transactions per second), which generally comes at the cost of higher levels of centralization.""  Scams prevalent  Yet for all of the growth around these crypto-assets, the report also came to a troubling conclusion: the vast majority of ICOs launched to date have proven to be fraudulent in nature.  The report calls them ""Identified Scams"" – that is, projects that ""did not have/had no intention of fulfilling project development duties with the funds, and/or was deemed by the community (message boards, website or other online information) to be a scam.""  ""On the basis of the above classification, as a percentage of the total number of ICOs, we found that approximately 78 [percent] of ICO's were Identified Scams, ~4 [percent] Failed, ~3 [percent] had Gone Dead, and ~15 [percent] went on to trade on an exchange,"" the report states.  Other researchers have looked at projects that failed to maintain traction in the months following their respective sales.  A recent report from a team at Boston College similarly found that more than half of the token projects they examined fell into inactivity within four months of the sales.  Yet in terms of the actual dollars that have gone into ICOs, Satis found that just 11 percent of funding went to those it identified as scams, or about $1.7 billion. That figure actually drops to a minute 0.3 percent when you cut out the three biggest scams – Pincoi, Arisebank and Savedroid – that have been identified.  Regulatory shift  The report also details how many projects have been seeking sunnier shores, so to speak, in terms of finding more appealing regulatory environments.  The number of ICO fundraising projects based in the Cayman Islands rose from a reported 3% to 40% in the last year while the U.S. faced a sizeable drop from 32% to 10%.  Hinting to subsequent reports yet to be published by Satis Group, author Sherwin Dowlat wrote that a more comprehensive analysis into the ""wide variety"" of regulatory approaches taken by states within the U.S. specifically would be provided ""in a subsequent note.""  This being the second in the research series, Satis Group is set to publish three more reports all aimed at delivering ""a comprehensive understanding of the pillars that comprise the crypto-asset universe.""

From there, clients can choose to fork out more cash to have the product further developed or walk away with the work as it stands.  Chris Pilling, lead architect at Fujitsu's Blockchain Innovation Centre, which opened back in March, explained, ""It would be great to say, yes, we've met the proof of business and they want to get the global blockchain team involved... [but] we allow the customer to go away and play with the prototype.""  This ""proof of business"" approach, in contrast to a proof-of-concept, is a way for clients to run through a business process that focuses on creating ""business value"" and avoids common ""pitfalls"" of blockchain projects, according to Frederik de Breuck, head of the Blockchain Innovation Centre.  The overall aim of the service is either to provide a fast way to kick off new blockchain development or to improve blockchain projects already in development.  According to Fintech Finance, de Breuck explained:  ""Inspired by high levels of interest from our customers, we have created this ready-to-go package not only to jump-start the customers' blockchain efforts but also to review and improve existing projects. Available immediately across the EMEIA region, we expect this assessment to have a major impact on unlocking blockchain's potential for business use cases.""

42380987,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93BbB,1531400430,100 Tokens By 2020: Ledger Pledges Big Expansion for Crypto Custody,"The race among crypto custodians to secure high-end clients is growing fiercer by the day.  Ledger  , the France-based wallet and custody startup, is ramping up the number of cryptocurrencies it supports to meet the demand for multi-coin solutions, particularly from institutional investors.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, the company will add support for new crypto assets on the first Tuesday of each month, starting in August, with a goal of having more than 100 supported by the end of 2019. Currently, Ledger's products and services handle only about two dozen tokens, and this week it's adding support for tron (TRX) and zcoin (XZC).  The move is yet another sign of how the cryptocurrency industry is rapidly evolving, with an ever-widening array of assets to choose from and big-money players nosing around for investment opportunities and influencing companies' business decisions.  While Ledger, founded in 2014, is primarily known for its hardware wallet and corresponding app for individual bitcoin users, CEO Eric Larcheveque cited its newer business lines – which offer custody services to hedge funds and other big players – as the driver behind this ""Token Tuesdays"" initiative.  ""If we want to sign those [institutional] customers, we don't have a choice,"" Larcheveque told CoinDesk. ""We have to support the top 100 cryptos, minimum.""  For similar reasons, BitGo recently added support for 57 ethereum-based assets to its custody services for institutions. Meanwhile, thousands of wealthy accredited investors are on a waiting list for the crypto key management startup Casa, which is scheduled to release its self-managed bitcoin solution in August and eventually add other tokens.  In turn, however, Larcheveque predicted offering custodial support for a wider range of tokens could bring would-be whales off the sidelines, saying:  ""This will allow hundreds of hedge funds to deploy their capital into crypto, and enable all these other financial institutions to move billions into crypto.""  Further, Ledger president Pascal Gauthier said bringing traditional players into the wider crypto ecosystem would bolster bitcoin's real-world value, even if these investors ultimately buy other crypto assets. After all, the world's largest cryptocurrency is still one of the largest liquidity conduits for cashing out tokens.  More broadly, ""institutions coming into this industry means that there is even more trust and it brings more value to the industry,"" Gauthier said.  A rising tide...  As Ledger courts institutions, it aims to do so in a way that enhances the hardware wallet's utility for retail investors as well.  ""I would say that the major drive for crypto integration, in the end, comes from the needs of our enterprise customers,"" said Larcheveque. ""At the same time, it profits our hardware wallet users. It's a virtuous circle.""  For example, this week the startup also unveiled an upgraded version of the hardware wallet's companion app. Unlike its predecessor, which was really several apps in one, the new Ledger Live automatically pushes updates to all parts of the app, so the company can add support for new tokens faster.  Now, it's much easier to imagine adding dozens of cryptos in just one year to meet Ledger's business goals. At the same time, individual users can now manage different assets in one place rather than switching from one app to another.  ""We really want to cover the maximum amount of cryptocurrencies,"" said Larcheveque. ""The Live [app] is the first step in this direction because it will give us a new foundation, a new platform, where we can add as much crypto as we want.""  App usage is growing faster than demand for Ledger's hardware wallets, of which the company has sold over one million units. Larchevêque said the app, which can be used without the wallet, grew from 100,000 monthly users in November 2017 to 500,000 monthly users today.  Open-source tools for Ledger Live also allow external communities to build support features for their favorite crypto. ""Then we can publish them [support features] after review,"" Larcheveque said. ""Thanks to the community work by all these developers, we can scale much faster by adding new cryptos.""  Indeed, according to Tron's head of engineering, Tian Han, Ledger's new tron support was spurred in part by user-submitted code, although his organization also provided financial assistance.  ""Users got together to form a team to build the implementation. Tron employees weren't involved aside from giving a grant,"" Han told CoinDesk. ""We also awarded an $80,000 grant to the Ledger Wallet integration team members, and have future grants planned for Trezor Integration as well.""  Self-custody tradeoffs  To some, the rush to offer token custody solutions to Wall Street incumbents may seem hard to square with the crypto community's ""be your own bank"" philosophy.  But Ledger actually has two business lines targeting institutional investors. One is a series of partnerships with organizations such as Nomura Bank in Japan, which uses Ledger's tools for full-custody services, more akin to a traditional deposit.  The other is called the Vault, an enterprise-grade custody solution for teams at an institution, like traders at a hedge fund, to self-manage crypto assets, an arrangement that's more in line with the crypto community's ethos. This multi-signature wallet is connected to many individual hardware devices for each team member.  ""They are being their own bank just like with the Nano S [Ledger's hardware wallet] you are being your own bank as an individual,"" Gauthier said. ""The different managers that are signing off on the transactions will all have a device""  So far, this self-custody approach appears to be rare, though. Typically, institutions don't want to manage their own private keys, and even some that do so don't want to be completely self-reliant.  ""The best solution is I have a key, my partner has a key, and some guy that I've never heard before has a key,"" said Travis Kling, co-founder of Ikigai Asset Management, a hedge fund that uses BitGo in this way.  In the view of Jameson Lopp, an infrastructure engineer at Casa, institutions are applying ""old world"" ideas about custody to these new digital assets.  Although full-custody services don't align with Lopp's philosophy of self-reliance, he acknowledged the need for a spectrum of services and healthy competition between companies like Casa, Ledger, and BitGo. He told CoinDesk:  ""It's perfectly fine if people choose to trust a third party. But the whole reason we got into this system in the first place is that people don't have to do that if they don't want to.""

42380996,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93BmV,1531396832,Bank of Queensland Rules Out Crypto Purchases With Mortgage Funds,"An Australian retail bank has revised its contract terms to prohibit borrowers from using loans such as mortgages to purchase cryptocurrency.  According a report from Australia Finance Review on Thursday, Bank of Queensland, which is publicly traded on Australia's stock exchange and one of the country's oldest retail banks, has confirmed the change of the loan agreements, which now state that ""any loan purpose that involves the acquisition of or usage of cryptocurrency is unacceptable"".  The move is the result of concerns over recent price volatility of the cryptocurrency market, as well as Australian regulators' increasing scrutiny over the nascent space, the report said.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, Austrac, the country's financial intelligence agency, announced a new rule mandating know-your-customer measures across crypto exchanges in April of this year. The Australia Taxation Office has also been seeking public feedback on how should best tax profits made from cryptocurrency trading.  Bank of Queensland's decision also comes as most other lenders in Australia are discouraging borrowers from using real-estate mortgages to make high-risk investments.  Citing an anonymous broker in the industry, the report said lenders in the country are currently monitoring borrowers' accounts for signs funds are being used to trade or purchase cryptocurrencies.

42380979,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9391P,1531393201,Bitcoin Price Puts Bull Move on Hold as Downside Risks Grow,"Bitcoin (BTC) traded largely sideways over the last 24 hours, though a dip soon before press time may threaten a developing bullish chart pattern if the price moves below $6,000.  BTC's drop below the 10-day moving average (MA) on Tuesday neutralized the immediate bullish outlook and shifted risk in favor of a sell-off to $6,000.  However, the cryptocurrency defended $6,300 yesterday amid intraday oversold conditions, establishing the round figure as a key short-term support. But, the resilience failed to entice bulls, rather a long liquidation (unwinding of long BTC trades) gathered pace, creating downside pressure on prices.  Consequently, BTC fell to a low of $6,145 earlier today and was last seen trading at $6,170. Clearly, the risk of a drop below $6,000 has increased substantially in the last few hours.  It is worth noting that the probability of BTC's price charting a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern would drop sharply if the cryptocurrency finds acceptance below $6,000.  Hourly chart        The bear flag breakdown, a bearish continuation pattern, indicates the sell-off from the recent high of $6,820 has resumed and prices could revisit the June 24 low of $5,755 (target as per the measured height method).  The major moving averages (50,100 and 200) are trending south and are located one below the other, signaling the path of least resistance is to the downside. So, a break below $6,000 could be on the cards.  The only factor that may help BTC stay above $6,000 is the oversold conditions shown by the relative strength index (RSI). That said, the relief could be short-lived as the RSI on the longer duration charts is biased to the bears.  Daily chart  The RSI is hovering below 50.00 (bearish) but is holding well above the oversold region (below 30.00), which means there is plenty room for a drop towards $5,755 (bear flag breakdown target).  Daily chart: Bull reversal in doubt?  The inverse head-and-shoulders pattern comprises three successive troughs, the middle trough (head) being the lowest and the two outside troughs (shoulders) being low and roughly equal.  In BTC's case, the left shoulder's low is $6,108. So, BTC needs to create the right shoulder in the range of $6,000-$6,100, i.e. bulls need to defend the support at $6,000 and stage a solid rebound, else the dream of a picture-perfect inverse head-and-shoulders pattern will remain elusive.  View  Bitcoin risks falling below $6,000 in the next 24 hours and could extend the decline towards the recent low of $5,755, the hourly chart indicates.  Acceptance below $6,000 would kill the odds of BTC price charting an inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal pattern.  On the higher side, only a convincing move above $6,408 (high of the bear flag) would abort the bearish view put forward by the bear flag breakdown.

42380964,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX938jn,1531382408,Code Is Speech: Amir Taaki on Crypto's Debt to Phil Zimmerman,"Amir Taaki created libbitcoin, the first alternative bitcoin implementation, and worked on wallets such as Electrum and Darkwallet, as well as privacy markets and decentralized technologies.  Currently, he is establishing an academy in Barcelona to train hackers to work on revolutionary technology projects.      I recently had the honor of meeting Phil Zimmermann, the creator of PGP, the world's first freely available encryption software for the masses.  The development of PGP (which stood for ""pretty good privacy"") was a socio-political cause when Zimmermann managed to defeat the United States through a subversive mechanism and enshrine code as a form of free speech.  As such, it's a foundational tale for the cryptocurrency community, one well worth retelling from time to time.  During the late 1980s, around the fall of the Soviet Union, there was heavy activism in the nuclear disarmament movement. Zimmermann, a software engineer, was deeply involved, even going to prison at various points with Carl Sagan and Daniel Ellsberg. He became well known in the circles as a speaker and organizer.  As a believer in civil liberties, Zimermann felt that humans throughout history had shared secrets and made alliances with each other to organize politically. That we always had the expectation of a private communication with another person and no third party involved. And he wanted to extend this freedom to any two people communicating across the globe.  His concept of free speech was a direct consequence of his experience in organizing activists. PGP was specifically developed for anti-nuclear weapons activists. He took out six mortgages over a multi-year period to finance his venture, and he became skilled at making excuses to his banks. Yet he managed to pull through and PGP was born.  At the time, strong encryption software was classified by the U.S. government as military munitions that could not be exported from the country. Yes, cryptography was in the same category as missiles, fighter jets and advanced weaponry. It took an idealist like Zimmermann to have the courage to defy this law because of the conviction that privacy of speech through cryptography was a fundamental human right.  The U.S. government opened a criminal investigation against Zimmermann. Phil told us that despite it in retrospect being good for his career, at the time he was in a very stressful dark place and for several years he was working desperately with a team of lawyers to find avenues to keep himself out of prison.  Legal checkmate  It was at a conference when Zimmermann was approached by a big U.S. publisher, the MIT Press, who asked him to publish a user's guide to PGP. He immediately responded, ""Yes, but I want you to also publish a second book.""  Why? Zimmermann had heard about another case where Phil Karn had applied to the U.S. State Department Office of Defense Trade Controls for a license to export Bruce Schnier's book Applied Cryptography. This book includes many code samples for cryptographic algorithms with explanations and is a standard text in the field.  The regulator was puzzled why a book was being applied for a commodity exports license and replied back that there is no restriction on exporting books in the U.S. They didn't even consider the contents of the book, given that books are protected under the First Amendment right to free speech in U.S. Constitution.  Then Karn did something curious. He sent the same regulator a floppy disk with files including the same code inside the book. They promptly rejected it, since it contained cryptographic technology and was restricted by the munitions export list. Karn took the government to court and eventually won.  With that case in mind, Zimmermann told MIT Press that he wanted to publish a second book with the code for PGP. They accepted.  And this book contained everything you need for the PGP software package, the source code, the make files, all the config files... everything.  Then they repeated the same process Karn had done in applying for an export license. The government quickly realized it had been trapped. If they said no, the government would be no longer be able to regulate cryptography. If they said yes and accepted his export of the book, then Zimmermann would win his case.  Zimmermann and his team excitedly waited for an answer. He had caught them in a clever legal bind. They never responded, and very soon dropped the case against him.  Legacy  Later PGP and other cryptography products started to become big, and now play a fundamental role in our industry. Zimmermann went on to work on several other important cryptography related projects, steering and advising many standards including development of ZRTP which is an important widely used voice encryption system for messaging applications on mobile and desktop.  But it was his act of courage that led to the liberation of crypto from the control of the U.S. government into the hands of idealist hacker programmers, and more generally into securing our lives on the internet.  In 1992, the year after PGP was born, we saw the Crypto-Anarchist Manifesto calling for using this new power of cryptography to liberate humanity from the yoke of the state and central banks. Then in 1993, we saw the Cypherpunk Manifesto which laid down the philosophy for a movement which created many new ideas around digital currency and ultimately birthed bitcoin.  It was incredible to hear the story of a pivotal moment in computing history from the man himself. I'm sure I haven't done it full justice in my retelling but I hope I have captured the general importance of PGP in the heritage of the free technology movement.

42380967,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX938mJ,1531375206,Shanghai Stock Exchange: New Regulation 'Crucial' to Clear Way for DLT,"Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE), one of the world's largest securities trading venues by market capitalization, is eyeing the use of distributed ledger technology (DLT) in the securities market.  The SSE published a research paper on Tuesday, which analyzed the use of DLT in various stages of a security transaction, such as the pre-trading customer registration, securities issuance and trading, and post-trading settlement.  It went on to summarize some key benefits of adopting DLT in China's financial infrastructure, such as increasing the settlement efficiency by replacing the current T+1 model, under which a transaction can only be settled one business day after an order is executed.  As the world's fourth largest stock exchange with a market cap of $5.12 trillion as of December 2017, the SSE is a non-profit organization directly administrated by the China Securities Regulatory Commission.  With references to existing works focused on the topic carried out by its counterparts in other financial markets such as Hong Kong and Australia, the SSE identified two potential areas in the report where DLT may be beneficial in China, stating:  ""A general worldwide consensus is that DLT will be a new revolution for the financial industry. The first application use cases will be over-the-counter securities issuance and trading, as well as order book post-trading settlement.""  That said, the research paper suggested that a potential deployment of DLT at the Chinese stock exchange could still face a series of regulatory hurdles, as it is in conflict with the current centralized registration and settlement system.  For instance, the SSE currently uses a third-party intermediary as custodian and for settling post-trading transactions, yet the use of DLT could fundamentally eliminate that system. To do that, the market needs new legal framework issued by regulators and central government agencies.  The paper's author concluded:  ""Regulation should adapt to the evolving technology. We suggest regulators treat the topic of DLT as a crucial study area moving forward ... in order to develop a solid regulatory framework for embracing the financial innovation.""

42380974,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX938tr,1531368031,A $3.3 Billion Claim: Has Cardano's Blockchain 'Solved' Proof-of-Stake?,"""Proof-of-stake is solved.""  Even in an industry that's seen no shortage of grand proclamations, those words, issued by entrepreneur Charles Hoskinson in April, grabbed attention.  The CEO of blockchain firm IOHK (and one-time CEO of Ethereum), Hoskinson was seeking to send a message about a new research paper, one he believes proved that the company's novel twist on how blockchains come to consensus, called Ouroboros, had addressed long-standing concerns about whether the model can sufficiently secure investor funds.  Given the size of the claim (and its impact), it's an assertion that sparked doubt from cardano's more prominent competitors. However, months later the team at IOHK maintain Ouroboros may be the answer to one of crypto's most divisive questions – whether so-called proof-of-stake systems offer solutions to some of the industry's pressing problems.  So far, the market appears to be interested in the opportunity to support the thesis.  Soon to power the public blockchain Cardano, Ouroboros may one day support the world's eighth-largest cryptocurrency, with its 25 billion ADA tokens worth $3.3 billion. And a look at the history of proof-of-stake systems perhaps showcases why so much money is on the line.  First pitched by developers Scott Nadal and Sunny King in 2012, proof-of-stake offers what is claimed to be a more sustainable alternative to proof-of-work, the consensus method underlying the world's biggest blockchain by market cap, Bitcoin.  Allowing users to vote or ""stake"" their coins on a transaction history in exchange for rewards (instead of burning computational energy), it's relatively untested, having so far only been adopted in hybrid, small-scale or delegated formats.  So, while Bitcoin's security is comparatively proven (its blockchain is currently sustaining $114 billion and has held up for years), many crypto coders believe proof-of-stake is necessary to transition the industry into the next phase, in which users no longer have to own hardware in order to claim a blockchain's rewards.  The trouble is, no one can agree on how this should be done.  ""Different consensus algorithms do well in different environments,"" Nate Rush, a proof-of-stake researcher for Ethereum, told CoinDesk, ""If the assumptions that some protocol is 'solved' under turn out to break or be unrealistic, then this protocol can fail.""  Still, the team behind Cardano, IOHK, have worked to secure academic partnerships, as well as relationships with researchers in the field distributed computation in an effort to prove the proof-of-stake model can be achieved.  Taking the security of Bitcoin as its starting point, the chief scientist behind the protocol, Aggelos Kiayias, has created formal proofs for each step of the protocol's design, used to dispel doubt as to the algorithm's ability to protect assets.  Kiayias told CoinDesk:  ""Contrary to [other proof-of-stake protocols], we developed Ouroboros together with a formal proof of security that the protocol indeed captures the security properties of a robust transaction ledger like Bitcoin.""  Peer-reviewed protocol  But it's not just proof-of-stake researchers that disagree – in the broader landscape of consensus design, there are some who believe proof-of-stake is doomed from the start.  For example, Dahlia Malkhi, a distributed system researcher, claimed earlier this year that Ethereum's proof-of-stake model, Casper, is ""fundamentally vulnerable""– leading to a system where consensus is powered by the wealthy.  Yet, in this atmosphere of skepticism, Cardano has amassed a high degree of academic support, building strategic university relationships through IOHK – a for-profit company with centers in several universities, including the Toyko Institute of technology in Japan, University of Athens, and University of Edinburgh.  ""We basically have a kind of a university-company relationship, so what we generally do is we set up research centers, we embed some IOHK personnel within those research centers, and we subsidize the lab, and then we have some sort of control or influence over the research agenda,"" Hoskinson said.  Responsible for Ethereum Classic and Zencash, as well as Cardano itself, according to Hoskinson, these academic partnerships feed back into the IOHK's cryptocurrency solutions.  ""Generally, the output of this relationship are peer-reviewed papers and we have a team within IOHK that take those papers, extract specifications from them and then put them in the pipeline for implementation into products,"" Hoskinson continued.  Alongside further relationships at Lancaster, Kent University, Oxford, and Illinois, the advantage is that the relatively small pool of researchers equipped in the topic have had their eyes on Ouroborus, which has been toured around at various academic conferences as well.  ""We've brought in the total set of people who are actually looking at trying to break, trying to enhance, our core protocols, and there's a lot of hard work that has been achieved as a result of that,"" Hoskinson told CoinDesk.  Gearing up to become a fully fledged smart contract and cryptocurrency platform, Cardano currently has limited functionality, but it is introducing the necessary features to transition to proof-of-stake throughout this year.  Currently tweaking the final details under simulations, Hoskinson urged that Ouroborus comes with advantages over other protocols. For example, he says the system is the only one that will allow users to stake from cold storage, and use multiple addresses to manage their finances.  Hoskinson told CoinDesk:  ""The long-term goal is to try to completely replicate all of the security capabilities and functional capabilities that the proof-of-work system has without actually having to expend any of the electricity or effort that proof-of-work does, and it looks like, now that we've put about two-and-a-half years of research into this thread, Ouroboros is now converging to that stage.""  Theoretical unknowns  Still, at the time of writing, it's unclear how the protocol will behave in the wild, and there are ways in which the wider proof-of-stake research community hasn't been entirely receptive of Cardano's claims.  For example, no one has been as critical as EOS's creator Dan Larimer, a former colleague of Hoskinson, who wrote that not only is ""Ouroboros is a 400-pound bulletproof vest that doesn't actually stop the real bullets,"" but claimed it was a badly conceived variant of an algorithm he had designed in 2014.  (EOS uses a form of proof-of-stake that relies on delegated nodes that have been nominated the task of reaching consensus.)  Ethereum, of which Hoskinson was a co-founder, has also signalled skepticism.  For example, speaking on Reddit, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin warned one security assumption of the blockchain could allow hacker to create false histories on the blockchain.  There's also different approaches to design. While the protocol itself is in place, IOHK are still working on building the underlying incentive scheme, something that Casper researcher Vlad Zamfir believes should be designed in tandem with the tech.  Attempts by CoinDesk to engage researchers with published work on proof-of-stake also returned mixed results, with several offering no comment or suggesting they hadn't yet looked into the technology and its specific claims.  Theory meets reality  But according to Emin Gün Sirer, a Cornell University professor and researcher in consensus protocols, this is typical of the field.  ""Ouroboros has the advantage that it is peer reviewed and a well-credentialed research group stands behind the effort,"" Gün Sirer told CoinDesk, ""But it also suffers from a downside that plague many early proof-of-stake protocols, namely: the papers are long, dense and full of subtle proofs.""  As a result, Gün Sirer said, ""No two researchers in this area seem to agree on which papers have valid proofs and which have redefined the properties so as to make proofs meaningless. The academic community vets papers for academic rigor, not real world application.""  That said, Hoskinson believes this interaction with academia is essential for cryptocurrencies to migrate onto the next phase. He warned that while many blockchains make wide claims for the scalability and security of their product, there's not many laymen with the skillset to properly evaluate those claims.  As such, Hoskinson said he anticipates more research on Ouroboros and Cardano to emerge going forward.  ""We all talk about the Tendermints and the Decreds and the Caspers because these are industry accepted ones and they have good marketing,"" Hoskinson said.  However, he continued:  ""If you look under the current there's an increasing professionalization of the cryptocurrency space… serious scientists who have great credentials and are utilizing the peer review process and bringing decades of knowledge with them.""
