42377725,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73NC3,1414342402,What's Next for Bitcoin Wallet Security?,"Times have been busy in the bitcoin wallet world lately. Two hardware wallets – Trezor and BTChip – have finally shipped, and wallet security continues to mature.  In spite of all this, though, people who should know better are still being robbed because they fail to add more protection to their bitcoin holdings.  To tackle the issue of bitcoin wallet vulnerabilities, it's important to look at the security protections that are currently available for wallets, and to explore what work still needs to be done in the future.  Multisig  2014 was to be the year of multiple signatures (multisig), according to Gavin Andresen in his 2014 State of Bitcoin speech, and there has been a lot of activity on this front. Multisig allows wallet owners increased security by requiring that a third party sign off on transactions before they're finalized.  This paves the way for third party risk services, said Gary Rowe, CEO of popular bitcoin wallet Multibit:  ""If you are buying a £10,000 car or something like that with bitcoin, people might send a text to confirm that transaction.""  Multibit is based on Bitcoinj, a Java-based implementation of bitcoin. Bitcoinj now has multisig support built-in, along with pluggable transaction signers. But neither Multibit nor Hive, both of which are based on Bitcoinj, currently support multisig at the time of writing.  Other wallets, such as BitGo and Armory, which are focused more on enterprise users, have built in multisig support.  But we shouldn't pin all of our security hopes on multisig wallets.  ""Not everyone will buy into them as being part of the decentralised ethos of bitcoin, so they can’t be relied upon as being the only solution to the problem,"" said Rowe, who added that multisig wallets are also more complex to use than deterministic wallets.  Deterministic wallets  Early bitcoin wallets generated addresses randomly. Bitcoin addresses aren't supposed to be reused, which means that when used properly, there should be many addresses in a single wallet. This makes it difficult to recover those addresses if they are lost.  Deterministic wallets create addresses using a simple multi-word phrase, randomly created by the user. The phrase will also create the same set of addresses.  All of this makes it easier to solve the backup problem, said Aaron Vosine, creator of iOS-based Breadwallet:  ""If a wallet is deterministic then your wallet seed is all you need. This seed should be recorded offline as with a long password, or on a secure hardware device locked with an easy to remember pin code.""  Now, hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets are adding another dimension. They create 'trees' of addresses using a seed phrase. Any branch of the tree can be shared with another user, without giving away the whole tree. That makes HD wallets easily exchangeable with others without compromising privacy, and easily replicable.  These are all great developments, but perhaps one of the biggest evolutions this year has been the rise of the hardware wallet. Bitcoinj project leader Mike Hearn lauded the shipment of Trezor:  ""It’s worth repeating this – there is no more sophisticated financial authenticator device in the world, as far as I’m aware. The standard used by banks in the EU and elsewhere (CAP) isn’t as easy to use, and once Trezor integrates support for the payment protocol, it will be more secure than CAP too. US banks don’t even get close.""  Other wallets are rapidly rolling out support for hardware wallets. Multibit's Trezor integration should be live in a couple of weeks, said Rowe.  Room for improvement  In spite of the strides made this year, there are still significant challenges for wallets.  One of the biggest concerns is malware, said Breadwallet's Vosine. The threat from malware is only likely to increase, and Android has been a hotbed of malware activity.  Vosine explained:  ""I feel strongly that bitcoin-stealing malware is the biggest threat right now, especially for desktop wallets. A not-insignificant portion of the malware being discovered now is bitcoin stealing malware, and yet bitcoin is still very small.""  This is another reason to move into hardware wallets, commentators said, but hardware, too, has room for improvement.  Thomas Voegtlin, who created popular bitcoin wallet Electrum, said that he already has support for Trezor, and that BTChip integration is coming soon. The stage is set for the next evolutionary step in hardware wallets, he suggested:  ""Hardware wallets are a great advancement over web and desktop wallets, however the current generation still has to trust a host system for block chain data and payment addresses. It will be great once hardware wallets can run SPV verification and payment protocol validation on the secure device.""  Nicholas Bacca, creator of BTChip, has created a smartcard wallet which he said cannot be easily recovered by an attacker gaining physical access to the chip.  Bacca said he expects to see virtualisation play a part in the future:  ""Look for more hardware wallets implemented in secure elements, and having hardware wallets virtualized into secure environements such as TEEs [Trusted Execution Environments], however I don't believe this virtualization will be available or portable before 2–3 years.""  The use of TEEs and the associated Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) – both of which provide protected hardware areas for the execution of sensitive code – could end up negating the need for hardware wallets, argued Wendell Davis, founder of Hive Wallet:  ""I imagine mobile phones will have a kind of TPM at some point, so that could be the nail in the hardware wallet's proverbial coffin.""  People also want to carry around fewer devices, rather than more, he asserted, adding that they tend to opt for less secure but more convenient options.  Biometrics  Phone companies are already trying to marry security and convenience, in the form of biometrics; Breadwallet will soon have support for Apple's TouchID, Vosine said.  Multibit's Rowe isn't a big fan of biometrics. He said he worries that fingerprints, voice recognition and even iris scans can be compromised. In any case, the accuracy rate isn't perfect, he warned, which makes it difficult for widespread adoption.  Vosine, on the other hand, is putting a limit pin code on the phone to avoid people copying fingerprints and hacking a phone. Hearn has also considered using an NFC 'badge' that someone can wear in their pocket to help verify the phone that they're using.  As all of these security measures make their way into wallets in one form or another, where does this leave Bitcoin-Qt, the reference wallet created by the core developers? In the past, Bitcoin's lead developer has indicated that Bitcoin-Qt would be spun off from the core project.  It may be significant that recent releases of the bitcoin daemon – the underlying bitcoin code that keeps the network running – can now be compiled without bitcoin functionality at all.  The delta between the reference implementation and other wallets in the field is growing, warned Hearn:  ""Bitcoin-Qt still isn’t even HD, let alone pluggable multisig HD, so I think we’ll see this wallet fall further and further behind.""  Usability  Atop all of this, we still have the usability problem to contend with. There's always a tradeoff between security and convenience, and the same is true with secure wallets, Hearn warned:  ""For instance Bitcoin Authenticator is pretty straightforward, but you still have to scan a QR code from your phone, write down a couple of 12-word wallet seeds, and so on. It can be made simpler but this is an ongoing challenge.""  One of the biggest problems, according to Hive Wallet's Davis, is that people still fail to follow even basic security guidelines with wallets.  ""We know that an absolutely appalling number of users simply ignore the two lines of instructions about writing down their seed phrase. They just breeze forward and ignore the warning, marked in red,"" Davis explained.  Bitcoin wallets are more secure than ever before, and in many cases, already far more secure than the banking industry's arcane credit card system, in which you give merchants your name, credit card details, and even your secret code – and often over the Internet.  Nevertheless, there is more work to be done. The tools can be improved, yes – there is always another technical trick to add. But at this point, when technical security is outpacing that in conventional financial industry, it may be user behaviour that needs enhancing.

42377741,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73NSP,1414336310,The Family That Mines Bitcoin Together Stays Together,"For John Tuberosi, bitcoin mining has always been about family. Since he began mining digital currencies earlier this year, Tuberosi has slowly but surely recruited more members of his family, including his children, sister and brother.  Yet it was the addition of his mother to the family's mining operation last week that served as the catalyst for even wider interest within his tight-knit community back home in San Pedro, California, Tuberosi said.  He told CoinDesk:  “My mom has been doing everyone’s taxes since 1969. My mother is the most trusted and respected person in this town. People found out she was mining last week and there’s been a line outside my door with people wanting to learn more.”  Tuberosi’s mining operation has evolved since it began taking shape in January. A few graphics cards turned into a basement of ASICs, and today, Tuberosi maintains a portfolio of both hardware and cloud-based mining resources that he says continues to grow.  Since starting the JustUsMining group 9 months ago, Tuberosi said, he has felt more personally driven and focused than ever before in his life. The inclusion of his wife and children in the process – his kids have their own miners and his daughter helps manage the family’s BTC accounts – has made the journey a personal one.  According to Tuberosi, the experience of mining digital currencies hasn't just been about making money or chasing a new opportunity. Recent bitcoin-funded trips, including one to the Hashers United mining conference in Las Vegas, underscore what Tuberosi calls a complete transformation of his and his family’s lives.  Early trials  Tuberosi’s interest in bitcoin began in 2013, when an investment tip prompted him to become an early adopter. The technology’s now-infamous price surge at the end of that year convinced him of the opportunity that lie inside mining and generating new coins, motivating him to start seriously investigating hardware for a home-based rig.  At the outset, though, he wasn’t sure where to begin.  “I had no idea what I was doing. None at all. The first computer chip took two days to build, it was nothing but errors.”  Tuberosi said he fell into a trap familiar to many who decide to get into personal computing: buying expensive equipment you simply don’t need. After a while, he continued, he came to understand the steps needed and, over time, was able to get his first GPU-based rig running.  Yet the process of achieving profitability wasn’t over. He said:  “I get my first electricity bill. My God. I was using high-end cards that were sucking so much juice. I look at my wife and say, we need to do something different.”  Tuberosi was able to capitalize on a big upswing in demand for graphics cards earlier this year, exchanging the hardware for lower-wattage cards that he said delivered better results. Tuberosi turned those early profits into even more equipment, including then-new ASICs through Gridseed and GAWMiners.  The time wasn’t without risk, Tuberosi said. A big increase in public interest surrounding digital currency gave rise to scams that targeted individuals interested in mining.  Citing a “nose” for suspicious business ideas, Tuberosi described instances in which he would come into conflict with companies claiming to sell the latest equipment.  “I was calling these people, I would smell something bad and I’d question them, I’d tell them – I caught you,” he said. “You’re mining, you’ve got nothing for sale and these people would hang up. I caught all these scams, so I had to build.”  Ramp up  Though blocks were being discovered and money was being made, Tuberosi explained that the result was a rather cluttered home in San Pedro.  By May, the venture reached a point in which makeshift solutions for power and infrastrucure needed to be addressed.  “I had my GPUs in my living room while my kids watched TV -- you couldn’t even watch TV anymore,” Tuberosi said. “I had extension cords running all through my house to bring the energy, so I hit on the idea to completely remodel my office.”  Tuberosi invested nearly $30,000 transforming his home office to meet the power needs of his mining rig. During this time, he continued to acquire ASICs and navigate a tricky business environment in which hardware was regularly delayed, disrupting growth plans.  It was around this time that the price of litecoin and many alternative digital currencies – as well as market volume – began to decline. This put pressure on profitability, driving Tuberosi to look at cloud-based options as his home mine grew.  The downturn also prompted those close to him to suggest that he consider pulling back on the mining venture. He and his family took a bitcoin-funded trip to Hawaii to celebrate his daughter’s birthday. It was during the trip, Tuberosi said, that he reaffirmed his decision to continue investing and building his mine.  He added:  “I knew inside that they didn’t know what this thing is. And when someone tells me to stop doing something, I’m the guy that says, watch me go. They tell me I can’t do it, I say watch me.”  Family focus  According to Tuberosi, the ability to give back to his family has been the best part of the experience. Thanks to the investment and income generated, he said, he was able to fly his wife to Argentina to see her mother, explaining:  “Her mother’s 80th birthday was October 3rd. I tell my wife, how would you like to go down to Argentina to surprise her for her birthday. She asks, you can do that? I say yes, you can – with bitcoin.”  “It’s incredible, he added, laughing. “Then the questions from my family rolled in.”  Phone call after phone call, Tuberosi continued, resulted in a number of friends and family members making investments of their own. He spent several weeks helping them set up their own mining rigs or configuring cloud purchases online.  Soon, even his mother was expressing interest in mining digital currency.  Looking ahead  Like most miners, Tuberosi freely acknowledged the long-term challenges of mining. Yet when asked if he would do anything differently, he said the experience has changed him as a person in ways that make the ups and downs worth it:  “I’ve never, ever in my life, been so on top of everything. Never. You know what [mining] is? A great system for self-empowerment.”  Tuberosi continued by saying he sees a bright future in the technology, both as a means of transacting as well as a method for connecting people. He pointed to his mother’s recent adoption of mining and the groundswell of interest from those around him as proof that digital currency can change lives.  ""Bitcoin is more than just money, it's the way things transact with each other,"" he said.

42377742,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73NUv,1414329161,Why Wall Streeters Are Turning to Bitcoin for a Living,"When banking giant Citi announced it would lay off 11,000 employees last May in a bid to save a billion dollars in expenses, Arthur Hayes was one of the staffers given a pink slip.  Hayes had been a 'Delta One' proprietary trader for Citi in Hong Kong, acting as a market-maker for the bank's Asian exchange-traded fund products. He had spent his career in financial institutions, starting out at Deutsche Bank.  While polishing his resume to rejoin the job market, Hayes came across bitcoin. He couldn't resist trading the cryptocurrency. To his delight, the markets turned out to be a gold mine for him:  ""I found there were lots of inefficiencies. If you apply traditional financial theory, it was mispricing everything. There was lots of money to be made trading bitcoin.""  Suddenly, reporting to yet another managing director at a bank became less attractive to Hayes. Trading bitcoin for a living beat hitting targets for bonuses.  ""You work all year for someone else [at a bank], then they'll tell you what you're worth with your bonus. With bitcoin, it's better. Everything you make is yours,"" he said.  Wall Street's calamities drive bitcoin trading  Hayes isn't the only one to turn his back on traditional finance to seek opportunities among cryptocurrencies. In the cryptomarkets, traders are finding the volatility they used to find in stocks, currencies and commodities – even as big banks continue to cut jobs and pay billions in fines in the aftermath of the financial crisis.  Regulators have slapped banks with heavy penalties in the last two years. The heftiest and most recent fine has been Bank of America, which agreed to pay $16.65bn to the Securities and Exchange Commission in August. The six biggest banks have paid $130bn in fines and settlements since 2009.  It's not just money that's flowing out of the banks. They're continuing to shed jobs around the world, too. Citi announced this month that it would shutter its consumer banking business in 11 countries, including Japan. JP Morgan is on track to make 17,000 positions redundant by the end of the year. According to research by Johnson Associates, banking as a whole is 20,000 jobs below the level of employment before the financial crisis.  All of this means that bank employees with a yen for cryptocurrency are more likely to make the jump now rather than wait to be pushed out. One of those people is George Samman, who managed portfolios at Wellington Shields, a New York brokerage. Today, he's trying to build a bitcoin derivatives exchange at BTC.sx.  ""Finance isn't the glorious place it once was. Bonuses are low, salaries are low. It's not where you want to be any more,"" he said.  Samman describes meeting ""old-school"" former colleagues recently who bombarded him with questions about getting into the bitcoin markets. They were tired of watching placid equity markets at work:  ""It's been slow for awhile ... Everyone's in a sad, miserable state because there's no money to be made. Trading volumes have been low, commissions have been slashed over time and it's a completely different place to what it was – and it's not coming back.""  Stagnant markets shrink opportunities to profit  Although the markets – particularly US equities – have been roiling in the last two weeks, they have been flat in recent years. From stocks to oil, traders have struggled for years to find the volatility they need to make money.  The VIX, known colloquially as the 'fear index', is the most widely used gauge of volatility in the US equities market. Last year it hit a five-year low of 11.3, well below its range the previous year. The Federal Reserve's quantitative easing policy is generally held to be the cause of low volatility in the financial markets.  Traders are hurting. A survey of the financial industry conducted in July by brokerage ConvergEx found traders grousing over the difficulty of trading profitably in a low volatility environment. More than 60% of firms on the sell-side – those who deal in products and services supplied to buyers like hedge funds and other institutions – said low volatility had been 'bad or very bad' for business.  Jean Marie Mognetti ran a commodities fund under the Global Advisors banner in Jersey. But as commodities trading ground to a halt because of flat prices, he and his partner, Daniel Masters, a former top trader at JP Morgan, began trading bitcoin for themselves.  ""We had a simple bullish view, and the more we saw, the more we wanted to see. It came to the point that we said we need to share this investment opportunity with other people,"" he said.  Mognetti and Masters launched Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund, a hedge fund for bitcoin based in Jersey, in July. They plan to have $200m under management, and have bought a first tranche of bitcoin from Digital BTC, the miner that listed on the Australian Stock Exchange.  Mognetti said the bitcoin markets have supplied more trading opportunities – and thus chances to make money – than his old stomping grounds of spot oil prices.  ""I can tell you right away, crude oil is extremely boring for the last year and a half [...] We're still trading commodities, but our commodity focus is slowing down because clients are not liking them. It's just like us being bored of crude oil.""  By contrast, clients are clamouring to get in on the cryptocurrency action, Mognetti claimed:  ""We never managed to sell anything in Jersey in six years. Now we get people in Jersey calling us,"" he said, days after his fund announced its launch in August.  Wall Street is losing its lustre among graduates  Former Wall Streeters who cross over to cryptocurrencies say they are hardly being ostracised for dealing in exotic digital assets. Instead, ex-colleagues are peppering them with questions and giving them kudos for closing profitable trades in digital currency markets.  Gavin Smith, who heads First Global Credit, a firm that provides contracts-for-difference on global equities that can be bought with bitcoin, said the cryptocurrency markets are what traders have been looking for since volatility died down in recent years. He used to devise risk-hedging strategies for Credit Suisse and Trafigura, the commodities trading giant.  ""[Cryptocurrencies] are more comfortable for people with our background because we're used to hedging what is quite a volatile underlying [asset]. The oil side of things has been especially quiet over the last three to four years. but we're used to the challenges of protecting your position in a more volatile environment.""  Earning big bucks at a bank appears to have lost its lustre among young people joining the workforce for the first time. Research by Universum, a consultancy that advises employers on how to position their brands for recruiting, shows that the attractiveness of joining a bank has dropped among business and commerce students over the last three years.  According to Universum, finance students, meanwhile, are still enthusiastic about bank careers, but they now see it as a stepping stone towards being an entrepreneur.  Hayes, the former Citi prop trader who has now started BitMEX, another bitcoin derivatives platform, said:  ""No one in banking loves their job. They're there because they're making money – currently. But they all understand that if there's something new and exciting, and there's a possibility of making great returns, they're totally supportive of it. All the startup guys make way more money now than banking guys, anyway.""
