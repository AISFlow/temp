42404883,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdlTcx,1595625671,CoinDesk's Twitter Hack Proved the Media Can't Rely on Web 2.0,"A rundown from one of CoinDesk’s editorial Slack channels during an action-packed hour on Wednesday last week reads like a high-pace drama.      It tells the tale of a news team going through a process of incremental information discovery.      First, there’s the realization that a big story – a massive hack on Twitter – is developing. Second, there’s the sudden comprehension CoinDesk itself has been targeted in that attack. And, third, there’s the scramble, with limited options and a certain sense of helplessness, to keep social media channels open to get that story out.      It’s a tale, also, of how media and information services like ours have developed an unhealthy dependency on centralized social media platforms over which they have very little control.    A growing story    Now that CoinDesk’s Twitter handle has finally, one week later, been restored, we think it would be helpful to include a truncated summary of that Slack conversation. This episode is, after all, a cautionary one:      At 3:21 pm ET on Wednesday, July 15, reporter Danny Nelson shared a screenshot of two side-by-side tweets, one from Binance’s account saying, “We have partnered with CryptoHealth and are giving back 5000 BTC to the community,” the other from Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao telling people not to click on the link and asking them to report the Binance account to Twitter admin.      “Someone been hacked by the looks of it,” Danny wryly observed. “If CZ was hacked this is some 3D chess.”      See also: Nic Carter - After the Twitter Hack, We Need a User-Owned Internet More Than Ever      From there, CoinDesk’s editorial team sprung into action, figuring out how to cover the story. Two minutes later, reporter Nikhilesh De, chimed in: “Apparently Gemini also got hacked.”      Soon after, reporter Zack Voell noted @AngeloBTC, a well-known bitcoin trader’s account, was also posting the same tweet. Something odd was up.      From then on, the transcript shows a sense of urgency. Colorful expressions of amazement and expletives fill the flow, as editorial instructions are meted out and journalists add to the list of hacked names from the crypto community: Coinbase, Kucoin and on.      At 3:45 p.m. ET, as it dawned on the team this was something central to Twitter rather than isolated to individual accounts, reporters David Pan and Nikhilesh De chimed in simultaneously with links to a bombshell tweet: @CoinDesk was tweeting out the same cursed message.      De proactively tweeted a message from the CoinDesk account via TweetDeck, to which he still had access, warning people to ignore the hackers’ message. Meanwhile, CoinDesk’s head of tech and product, Parker Ferguson, spun up a separate slack channel for editors and tech support to figure out how to address the CoinDesk outage problem.      Then, at 4:20 p.m. ET, with two teams now scrambling to tackle both the writing and technical needs, reporter Benjamin Powers weighed in with ““Uhhhh” and shared a tweet from Elon Musk’s account. The attack had leapt outside of the crypto community. It would soon grow to encompass the accounts of Apple, Joe Biden, Barack Obama and more than 100 others.    The lesson is that news organizations like ours, as important as ever in providing trusted information, are overly dependent on the behemoths of the Web 2.0 era.    Reporters and editors shared ideas on how to attack such a big story, but CoinDesk’s Twitter management problems were about to get worse. At 4:39 p.m, De weighed in again to the Slack channel. “F*** I just lost tweetdeck access @channel,” he wrote, quickly adding, “And social flow.”      Not only could the team not delete the offending tweet from the hackers, they could no longer put information out on the @CoinDesk feed. Who knew what else might be hit? Was Twitter protectively shutting down access to its API or did the hackers now have complete control of all our tools?      “I guess the only good news is that it's not just us,” posted podcast editor Adam B. Levine. “So they [Twitter] have to fix it. But until then we're passengers on this ride”    A long wait    Through the evening until after midnight, reporters and editors scrambled to get out articles based on this big, multifaceted story, while members of the editorial and tech teams coordinate outreach to Twitter and to come up with jury-rigged solutions to keep an open channel to our Twitter audience.      The decision was made to shift all tweets to a separate CoinDesk account, @CoinDeskMarkets, and just hope it wouldn’t be taken down. That account, which has less than a 20th of the followers tracking the main @CoinDesk account, became our core Twitter publishing vehicle for the next seven days.      A waiting period then ensued. Other accounts had their access restored, but @CoinDesk was delayed. It wasn’t until Wednesday this week that we learned why: @CoinDesk was among 36 of the total 130 hacked accounts that had their direct messages accessed.      Finally, on Thursday, after much wrangling with Twitter administration, CoinDesk’s access to its account was restored. A look at the DMs suggested all was in order. (The DMs from the account are not used very often, either by CoinDesk editors or outside users.)    Lessons learned    So ended a frustrating experience. CoinDesk doesn’t always have the most pleasant experience with members of “Crypto Twitter,” but the platform is where crypto and blockchain communities live. To be cut off from our audience, our life blood, was to have our mission interrupted.      What’s more, there was an awkward duality to the situation: As any journalist will tell you, media organizations want to report the news; they don’t want to be the news. When that happens, you must put on both hats, managing both the problem at hand and the coverage of it.      See also: Preston Byrne - Twitter Doesn’t Need Web 3.0 to Solve Its Identity Problem      The lesson is that news organizations like ours, as important as ever in providing trusted information, are overly dependent on the behemoths of the Web 2.0 era: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.      CoinDesk’s experience of the Twitter hack gives weight to an argument that runs strong in the crypto community, especially among those working on so-called Web 3.0 solutions. That is to say a decentralized model in which users retain control and ownership of their highly valuable data and content in theory would be less vulnerable to these kinds of hacks and give power to those who create the valuable content and communities in these networks.      There are challenges to achieving this vision – whether users should or want to be responsible for securing their data, for example, and whether it’s possible for a decentralized platform to create sufficient network effects or economies of scale to attract enough users away from the big communities on Twitter, Facebook and Google.      But events like this are a reminder of why developers need to keep working to overcome those challenges. The world needs a better, fairer, more distributed, less vulnerable information system.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | TRADING | BNB,Michael J.

42404890,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdlTir,1595622292,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Near $9,600 as Gold Hits High, Uniswap Liquidity Over $100M","As bitcoin closes in on $9,600, gold surpasses $1,900 and DeFi liquidity steadily grows.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $9,592 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 0.03% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $9,475-$9,601  BTC above 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Gold is on the brink of an all-time high, up 0.80% Friday, at $1,901 per ounce. Sweden-based over-the-counter bitcoin trader Henrik Kugelberg sees gold nearing its all-time high as a positive for the world’s oldest cryptocurrency. “Bitcoin will pass $20,000 in a surge. I suspect a new normal discounted bitcoin price will be around $15,000 in 2021, like it has been around $9,000 in 2020.”      Bullish bitcoin traders love to talk about gold, since they see similarities between the yellow metal and the cryptocurrency. “I think we are just a couple weeks or months out from a strong continuation on bitcoin as gold reaches $1,900 today,” said William Purdy, a New York-based equity options and crypto trader.      Indeed, gold’s jump this week occurred as bitcoin eked gains and the S&P 500 U.S. stock index performance was back to being flat for 2020.      Kugelberg is pessimistic on stocks for the balance of 2020. “I believe there will be at least a 30% drop in stocks on average at the latest in Q4. So where to go? To real assets with lasting value,” said Kugelberg. He mentioned gold, bitcoin and property as “real assets”.      “Bitcoin bulls have momentum on their side for now,” said Alessandro Andreotti, an Italy-based over-the-counter bitcoin trader. “The crypto market is likely to be heading towards a bullish continuation from here.”      Within crypto, ether is doing even better than bitcoin this week. ETH/BTC, that is, ether priced in bitcoin, has seen a jump in the past few days.      Ether prices have increased almost 12% against bitcoin, said Aaron Suduiko, head of research for cryptocurrency liquidity provider SFOX. “It will be interesting to see whether any trends develop in the event that more DeFi projects continue to grow.”    Uniswap crosses $100 million in liquidity    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was up Friday trading around $283 and climbing 3.6% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Read More: Ether Leaves Bitcoin Behind With 2020 Gain of Over 100%      “The recent gains in ether are due to the on-going thematic chatter on social media around new DeFi projects that have been showing considerable strength,” said Purdy, the equity options and crypto trader. Indeed, Uniswap, a decentralized exchange (DEX), for trading various DeFi project tokens, surpassed $100 million in liquidity Friday.      Instead of order books, Uniswap uses liquidity pools that investors can “stake” cryptocurrency into and profit or “yield” from trading fees on the DEX. This liquidity is what enables Uniswap traders to quickly exchange between ether and various Ethereum-based ERC-20 tokens, with total daily volume reaching $71 million per day, according to data aggregator Dune Analytics.

42411955,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glhJzR,1595610350,Everything You Need to Know About Ethereum 2.0,"Ethereum 2.0 is coming.  The years-long upgrade – intended to radically transform the world’s largest smart-contract platform – is inching closer to deployment. The Ethereum Foundation recently announced “Medalla,” a final testnet before the mainnet launch of the Eth 2.0 beacon chain.  As of July 10, some developers, including Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, estimate the oft-delayed Eth 2.0 will launch by the end of this year.  To mark the fifth anniversary of the network’s launch, CoinDesk is producing Ethereum at Five – a cross-platform series featuring special coverage, a limited-run newsletter and live-streamed discussions on Twitter. New issues and sessions launch daily from July 27-31. The pop-up experience precedes another event in September focused on Eth 2.0.  When phase zero of Eth 2.0 does ship, little about Ethereum will change in the near term for users and dapp developers. This is because unlike all other system-wide upgrades in Ethereum history, the Eth 2.0 overhaul will primarily be happening on a different blockchain.  The first phase of development for Eth 2.0 is centered around the creation of a separate proof-of-stake blockchain network called the beacon chain. On this new network, ETH holders with a minimum of 32 ETH can earn rewards in the form of annualized interest on their wealth. To earn these rewards, ETH holders must have the appropriate hardware and software connecting to the beacon chain and a strong understanding of how the technology works.  In a new 22-page report from CoinDesk Research, the technology behind Eth 2.0 is explained as well as the phases of development it will undergo in the years after its launch.  Read CoinDesk Research’s full report on Eth 2.0  Ethereum as we know it today will eventually be folded into the Eth 2.0 upgrade in its entirety. The report features commentary from Ethereum developers about what benefits – but also risks – this may bring.  The report also discusses the potential market impact of Eth 2.0, including the ramifications of the new system’s economic design on coin supply, velocity and value.  Why it matters  The culmination of over five years of research and development, Ethereum 2.0 is a highly ambitious upgrade.  Never before has the cryptocurrency industry seen a blockchain of the same size and value as Ethereum attempt to transition all users, as well as assets, to an entirely new decentralized network while keeping all operations on the old network active and running.  Read more: Ethereum Turns Five Next Week: How CoinDesk Is Marking the Milestone  It will likely take many years for the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade – in all its complexity – to be complete.

You’re reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they’re significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.    Top shelf    Cryptic Payments The son of former Renault and Nissan head and fugitive Carlos Ghosn used Coinbase to pay two men $500,000 in bitcoin to get his father out of Japan last December. U.S. prosecutors said Wednesday that Anthony Ghosn sent 63 bitcoin to Michael and Peter Taylor, a father and son team who smuggled Carlos Ghosn out. Coinbase gave evidence to Japanese investigators this week, showing a series of transactions between January and May 2020 from Ghosn's Coinbase account to one belonging to Peter Taylor. Wednesday's filing shows a bank account managed by Peter Taylor also received two wire transfers, totaling over $870,000, from Carlos Ghosn's account in October 2019.      Work to Do The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) said banks can provide custody services for cryptocurrencies. The move is widely praised as a step towards mainstreaming crypto. However, it’s unclear whether banks will immediately act on the regulatory clarification. Congressman Darren Soto (D-Fla.), said the letter was “an important step” to better integrate cryptocurrencies into the U.S. financial system, but cautioned “the federal government is still behind in incorporating” cryptocurrency. “I don’t expect you will see much change in the next three to four months, but then we might see some acceleration thereafter,” Trustology CEO Alex Batlin said. “This will come up as banks will be holding investment committees for funding approvals for the next year.”      Assessment of the Facts Four experts agree that Craig S. Wright’s latest claims about Bitcoin message-signing are wrong on the facts. Wright, who claims he’s Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, is embroiled in a legal battle that hinges on his purported ownership of a number of the earliest Bitcoin addresses. Recently, an anonymous user signed a public message using 145 of those keys, calling him a “liar and a fraud,” an accusation Wright countered by saying, “You cannot have a digital signature that is anonymous, by definition.” Four cryptography experts now dispute these claims, with Johns Hopkins associate professor Matthew Green saying, it “makes zero sense to me as a cryptographer… If Craig Wright is saying something meaningful here then he needs to slow down and explain it more clearly. Because the words he’s using sound like nonsense to me.”      Red Wall Russia’s Federal Security Service, or FSB, the successor to the KGB, supervises all industries related to cryptography and may be holding back the local blockchain sector. The FSB’s rigid certification process for crypto companies could cost more than $100,000 and take at least a year, according to experts on the Russian enterprise blockchain market. Further, this borderless technology is sometimes stonewalled by the watchdog, which is distrustful of foreign-developed blockchains. It works in reverse too. Russian-made systems might end up isolated from the global market due to distrust of Russian government cryptography standards.      Future of the Internet A debate hosted Wednesday night featuring Protocol Lab’s Juan Benet, Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin and former Coinbase executive Balaji Srinivasan detailed competing visions for the future of the internet. While all parties agreed the world needs to move towards decentralized models – especially in social media – there were differing opinions about how and when data should be verified in distributed systems. “My impression is we are headed to a much better future where the data structures are going to be decoupled from the [user interfaces],” Benet said. “There will be many different systems built atop the same information graph.”    Quick bites  Arca’s flagship crypto hedge fund is up 77% in 2020  Crypto bank hopeful Bitcoin Suisse raised a $48 million Series A  Central bank board member says CBDCs raise more questions than answers – calling it “helicopter money”  Opera’s built-in crypto wallets have 170,000 monthly active users  SEC registered broker-dealer is launching a security token platform called Gladius  The big idea    Signature Bank saw $1 billion in deposit growth in the second quarter of 2020 from the firm’s digital assets team, according to its latest filing.      The New York-based bank is one of a handful – including Silvergate Bank and Metropolitan Commercial Bank – willing to take deposits from blockchain firms. And it’s a risk that seems to be paying off.      Signature’s blockchain-related business lines represented one-eighth of the firm’s total $8 billion deposit growth this quarter.      “The crypto industry is often a rich source of low-cost, non-interest bearing deposits for crypto-friendly banks like Signature,” CoinDesk’s Nathan DiCamillo reports. According to Signature CEO Joseph DePaolo on the firm’s earnings call, the cost of those deposits decreased to 56 basis points from 98 basis points because of the low interest rate environment.      “This is now the fourth consecutive quarter exceeding $1 billion in both total and average deposit growth, non-interest bearing deposits of $16.1 billion still represent a high 32% of total deposits since the second quarter of last year,” DePaolo said.      For years, crypto and banking was like oil and water. Most of the Wall Street banking powerhouses – like Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo – were reluctant to enter into this poorly understood and underregulated market.      In 2017, for instance, J.P. Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called Bitcoin a fraud. It now looks like he’s singing a different tune – with his bank taking on Coinbase as a client last May.      Brian Brooks, Coinbase’s former chief legal officer and now senior deputy at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which recently issued a letter allowing crypto custody among chartered banks, said at the time the trend will likely continue.      This doesn’t necessarily mean the original lot of crypto-friendly banks will be pushed out of the market. Silvergate, which once banked Coinbase, has plans to continue expanding its crypto services.      In an industry of constant evolution, there will always be new paths to profits.    Market intel    Flatlining Interest Volume and open interest on Bakkt has flatlined at $0 since June 15, according to Skew. The Intercontinental Exchange's subsidiary launched its bitcoin options market in December 2019. Open interest for the exchange’s options market has suffered complete inactivity before, but the current 38-day streak dwarfs other periods. Bakkt's options volume has also dropped to $0 since April 23, Skew said.      Going Public? Digital-asset industry insiders say a move toward more public ownership of crypto firms could accelerate mainstream adoption. “By becoming publicly traded, cryptocurrency-focused companies could appeal to investors in the $35 trillion U.S. stock market. Back-of-the-envelope math shows that just a 1% allocation into crypto stocks could mean $350 billion of new investments for companies in the space,” CoinDesk’s First Mover reports. The total market value of all digital asset markets currently sits at $287 billion. According to CoinDesk Research, there’s more than two dozen publicly-traded firms, with many more like Coinbase and Ant Group rumored to be in the process of listing.    Opinion    Banks Won't Bite Alex Mascioli, head of institutional services for Bequant, thinks banks aren’t likely to jump at the opportunity to custody crypto assets. Last Wednesday, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) announced banks can offer crypto and digital asset custody to their clients, which could be a profitable new business line. However, there’s inertia standing in the way. “The bulk of banks and other sophisticated players in the old school markets don’t know much about our industry. Most of them don’t appear to have even done anything as basic as buying a fractional Bitcoin on Robinhood,” he writes.    Podcast    Big Tech’s Effect on Small Biz Sahil Bloom, an investor with Altamont Capital Partners, joins as a guest on the latest episode of The Breakdown to discuss the recent increase in joblessness claims, remote work and Robinhood traders.

42404875,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdlTU6,1595599250,Banks Won't Rush to Hold Crypto – But OCC's Regulatory Approval Makes It Harder to Ignore,"The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), a federal banking regulator in the U.S., is rapidly expanding crypto awareness on Capitol Hill.      The OCC published an interpretive letter Wednesday announcing that in its view, nationally chartered banks are able to provide custody services for cryptocurrencies, a move that the industry widely praised as one that could help mainstream adoption of crypto, even though it’s unclear as to whether banks will immediately act on the regulatory clarification.      This development is likely to be very positive for the digital assets space, but major U.S. banks probably won’t be holding Bitcoin any time soon.      Congressman Darren Soto (D-Fla.) told CoinDesk in a phone call the letter was “an important step” to better integrate cryptocurrencies into the U.S. financial system, though he cautioned that “the federal government is still behind in incorporating” cryptocurrency.      “We support further integration of cryptocurrency into the financial system, including allowing the major financial institutions to hold this currency. It’ll lead to further legitimization of crypto,” he said.      Across the aisle, Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) agreed, telling CoinDesk in an emailed statement that providing custody is “a big step forward” for financial innovation.      Both representatives are members of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus.      “[Acting Comptroller] Brian Brook’s work should serve as a guiding light forward for the rest of our patchwork of financial regulators,” Emmer said.      Read more: Don’t Expect Banks to Jump on the OCC Crypto Custody News      A number of aspects of the letter make it interesting, said a Congressional staffer, who advises a lawmaker on fintech issues and asked for their name to be withheld. The first was its rapid release, given Brooks just took the job in May. The staffer said a number of lawmakers will claim that insufficient research was put into the benefits or detriments of the move.      Even the bullish Soto noted the OCC’s announcement seemed hurried.      “We’ve seen some things rushed throughout the Trump administration so this isn’t particularly surprising,” Soto said, though he added, “it’s been a long time coming. This should have happened months or years ago.”      The congressional staffer added that the form of the letter is interesting, in that it’s not an announcement or a rule. “It looks like it’s an interpretive letter, which maybe a specific bank asked for … and that’s fairly normal practice if regulations are a little ambiguous but usually … you don’t issue it writ large.”    Starting a conversation    Up until now, the lack of regulatory clarity has meant mainstream financial firms like Fidelity have managed to get into crypto, but only by going the long way around and creating a separate legal entity, such as Fidelity Digital Assets. The OCC letter provides clarity so that banks can get closer to crypto without worrying about regulatory uncertainty.      “People who are supportive of crypto and blockchain technology will see this as a very positive step, and the more skeptical crowd, this’ll further entrench their viewpoint,” the Congressional staffer said. “I think there’s a very large group of politicians who have never thought about this, so that’s the real benefit is it’ll start that discussion.”      Ron Hammond, a former aide to Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio), agreed the move might force a conversation around crypto, but noted that neither major party – Democrats or Republicans – currently have a platform around financial technology or digital assets.      He expects Democrats as a party to come out against the move, he told CoinDesk in a phone call.      “Democrats already are skeptical of banks [and] they’re even more skeptical of digital assets, so you put those two together and you have a pretty big policy storm of mistrust in the system,” he said.      Read more: Coinbase’s Ex-Lead Lawyer Sold $4.6M in Stock to Head US Banking Watchdog      Anti-money laundering and know-your-customer concerns may be brought up, along with the fact that Brian Brooks, the current Acting Comptroller of the Currency, has been neither formally nominated nor confirmed to his role.      The conversation about crypto will not be limited to Capitol Hill.      Alex Batlin, CEO of digital asset custody provider Trustology, and a former blockchain lead at BNY Mellon and UBS, told CoinDesk he expects there to be “a lot more conversations” about crypto in various company boardrooms this coming fall.    Open door    A number of barriers still remain before any nationally chartered banks are able to actually offer crypto custody services.      Hammond said that while the letter might provide cover for smaller banks, major ones would need more reassurance before they’d be willing to enter the space.      “I don’t expect you will see much change in the next three to four months, but then we might see some acceleration thereafter,” Batlin said. “I expect that after the summer this will come up as banks will be holding investment committees for funding approvals for the next year.”      There are also concerns around whether the letter can provide binding guidance. The congressional staffer noted that the relevant statutes could be interpreted differently by another administration, meaning a future letter or rulemaking process could tell banks the opposite of Wednesday’s missive.      Still, the OCC’s overtures open the door for much less risky and cheaper routes into crypto for big banks, said Batlin. The way banks are likely to dip their toes in is by going the sub-custody route, he said, by partnering with small specialist organizations.      “That’s exactly what a global custodian like BNY Mellon does anyway,” Batlin said. “Now that this activity is going to be regulated, I expect the cheapest solution for bigger banks is to have some kind of semi-derisked trial of this is to use someone as a sub-custodian.”    Following Europe    The OCC letter brings the U.S. closer to the situation in Germany, where lawmakers provided clarity that essentially eased restrictions on banks providing custody of crypto assets.      Germany's Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) released guidance earlier this year clarifying how firms based outside the nation could still provide custody services within Germany's borders and remain in compliance with international law, such as the European Union's Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive.      “The U.S. is following Europe, and the use cases are unlikely to be crypto coins,” said Phil Mochan, co-founder of Koine, a London-based custody and post-trade settlement solution for digital assets. “The banks in Germany are all saying they are not going to touch crypto coins, but are interested in primary issuance of securities on behalf of their clients.”      Mochan pointed out that simply providing cold storage of crypto keys does not resolve any of the post-trade activities needed for standard market infrastructure, which involves the emergence of blockchain-enabled central securities depositories (CSDs).    Election approaching    Back in the U.S., the upcoming presidential election is one wild card that might determine whether the next Comptroller reverses the decision or not.      “I don’t see a situation where a [Republican President Donald] Trump nominee, whether he be Brooks or someone else, would overturn this but I can see a situation in a [Democratic Presidential nominee Joe] Biden administration where this gets overturned,” he said.      That’s not to say a potential Biden administration would for sure overturn the move, and it’s unlikely to be a key priority, but the uncertainty remains.      “There’s no notice or comments, [no] input [from] the industry,” Hammond said. “I can see a Biden administration being more concerned about that and probably striking down the [letter].”      Soto said Congress needed to take action to bring further clarity, starting with passing the Token Taxonomy Act (which Hammond wrote while working for Davidson) and the Digital Taxonomy Act (which Soto sponsored).      “We need to pass both those bills to establish basic definitions and jurisdiction so there's no overreach by agencies and there’s more certainty,” he said. “I continue to be troubled by the fact that many new cryptocurrency firms have to spend [millions] due to the complex rules in the United States and that’s because we’ve left it solely to the agencies.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,"Nikhilesh De, Ian Allison",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/07/24/banks-wont-rush-to-hold-crypto-but-occs-regulatory-approval-makes-it-harder-to-ignore,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3ff36c7a06bf36b70241796a38d5c9644b1f3fb2-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

French prosecutors filed a petition to start the lawsuit against Vinnik on Wednesday, according to a news report from L'Express.  Vinnik was charged on the day he arrived in France in late January after been extradited from Greece.  He stands accused of extortion, aggravated money laundering, conspiracy, and harming automatic data-processing systems as the chief of the exchange BTC-e, closed by law enforcement agencies in 2017.  A hot wallet address for BTC-e can be seen on blockchain explorers.  The platform from Netherlands-based Crystal Blockchain shows that, while now empty, more than 733,000 bitcoin (around $7 billion) has passed through the wallet.  It has remained inactive since September 2017 – a few months after Vinnik was detained by the Greek authorities.  Once the French trial has concluded, Vinnik will be extradited to the U.S. and then Russia to face similar charges there.  Vinnik has maintained he is innocent of all charges.

42404885,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdlTdw,1595595357,Ether Leaves Bitcoin Behind With 2020 Gain of Over 100%,"Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, has more than doubled in value this year, leaving bitcoin, the crypto market leader, far behind.    Ether is trading near $275 at press time, representing a nearly 114% gain on a year-to-date (YTD) basis, according to CoinDesk’s Ether Price Index.  The cryptocurrency clocked a five-month high of $289 on Thursday despite increased exchange inflows.  Ether’s YTD rise is over three times bigger than bitcoin’s 34% 2020 rally.  Bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency by market value, is currently trading around $9,550.  Jehan Chu, co-founder and managing partner at Hong Kong-based trading firm Kenetic told CoinDesk that ether’s price is surging on increased general interest and the network's popularity in the decentralized finance space.  Ethereum’s median transaction fee recently rose to its highest level since August 2018 due to a surge in transaction activity.  Additional buying pressure for ether looks to be stemming from the excitement surrounding the impending transition from the proof-of-work mechanism (aka mining) to proof-of-stake in the network's next big upgrade, dubbed Ethereum 2.0.  Staking would allow investors to earn additional yield simply by holding ether to support the operations on the blockchain.  Glassnode data shows the number of addresses holding 32 ETH – the minimum balance needed to become a validator on Ethereum 2.0 – has increased by more than 12% this year, suggesting increased investor interest in the novel form of income.  While bitcoin was expected to print solid gains following the May 12 miner reward halving event, the cryptocurrency has remained largely stuck in a range between $9,000 and $10,000.

42404882,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdlTby,1595591084,Carlos Ghosn’s $600K Bitcoin Escape Fee Paid via Coinbase,"The son of former Renault and Nissan head and fugitive Carlos Ghosn used Coinbase to pay two men $600,000 in bitcoin to get his father out of Japan in December.    U.S. prosecutors said Wednesday that Anthony Ghosn sent 63 bitcoin to Michael and Peter Taylor, a father-and-son team who smuggled Carlos Ghosn out of Japan on Dec. 30, 2019.  Coinbase gave evidence to Japanese investigators this week (see below), showing a series of transactions between January and May 2020 from Ghosn's Coinbase account to one belonging to Peter Taylor.  Ghosn transferred what was then worth $500,000 of bitcoin to Taylor in seven transactions – the 63 bitcoin would now be worth $608,000.  Michael Taylor, a former Green Beret soldier, and Peter Taylor are currently being held by U.S. authorities at the request of Japan, which is trying to extradite them.  U.S. prosecutors filed the evidence in opposition to the Taylors' bid to be released on bail.  Wednesday's filing shows a bank account managed by Peter Taylor also received two wire transfers, totaling over $870,000, from Carlos Ghosn's account in October 2019.  Ghosn was arrested in November 2018 on allegations of false accounting and then of shifting a personal loss of $16.6 million onto Nissan's books.  Pleading innocent, Ghosn was held under house arrest for more than a year until his escape.  In December, he was smuggled out of the country in a double-bass case by the Taylors, who pretended to be a band playing at a dinner party.  Ghosn is now hiding out in his childhood home of Lebanon, having accused the ""rigged"" Japanese justice system of denying his basic human rights.

42404888,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdlTgt,1595590923,First Mover: Crypto's $35T Moment Could Come From Analog-World Stock Listings,"The stock market isn’t usually considered an ally of cryptocurrencies, but with the big U.S. exchange Coinbase now rumored to be considering a share listing, some digital-asset industry insiders say a move toward more public ownership could accelerate mainstream adoption.      By becoming publicly traded, cryptocurrency-focused companies could appeal to investors in the $35 trillion U.S. stock market. Back-of-the-envelope math shows that just a 1% allocation into crypto stocks could mean $350 billion of new investments for companies in the space. Compare that with the $287 billion total market value of digital-asset markets, and suddenly there's a lot more capital going into the industry, even if it's not directly into cryptocurrencies.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      New listings and initial public offerings would also be sure to generate a raft of coverage on analog-world TV channels like CNBC, while the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg News publish ostensibly breathless headlines on first-day trading action. No publicity is bad publicity, and all this just gives digital-asset companies generous exposure to a broader swath of potential investors who typically only deal in stocks.      Steve Ehrlich, CEO of the crypto brokerage platform Voyager Digital, which has been publicly traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange since February 2019, told First Mover in a phone interview that stock-market listings promise a whole new vista for the cryptocurrency industry.      “We always felt that being a public company was something that was necessary in the crypto space,” Ehrlich said, over the phone. “It’s great for the industry.”      A handful of crypto companies have already gone down the route of listing shares.      According to CoinDesk Research, there's more than two dozen publicly traded firms, from the the bitcoin-mining firm Argo, which listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2018, to the bitcoin-mining computer maker Canaan, which listed depositary receipts on the Nasdaq late last year. Bitmain, another mining-computer manufacturer, previously considered an initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong in 2018 and is rumored to be exploring a listing in the U.S.      Earlier this month, industry sources told Reuters that the San Francisco-based exchange Coinbase, worth approximately $8 billion at its last valuation, was seriously considering a direct listing in 2021.      Just this week, the Alibaba affiliate company Ant Group announced it was planning an IPO in both Shanghai and Hong Kong at a reported $200 billion valuation. Although the company is best known for its payment app Alipay, the Hangzhou-based company also runs its own highly scalable blockchain network and is believed to be one of the planned primary issuers for China’s digital yuan.      Should it go through, the dual IPO would arguably make Ant Group the largest company operating in the blockchain space.      Ehrlich, a long-time entrepreneur who previously served as a top executive at the online stock-trading firm E*Trade, said he welcomed the news that companies like Coinbase were now considering share listings.      According to Ehrlich, not only can auditors scrutinize Voyager’s financial statements, they can also help to make sure company operates in an ethical and regulatory compliant manner. That could provide the accountability, transparency and comfort demanded by investors, especially for a still-maturing industry that has been pocked by controversies, scams, hacks and fraud.      Binance, the largest exchange in the world, has resisted calls to divulge the location of its headquarters. Tether, the $10 billion stablecoin, is dogged by allegations that the token is not properly backed by dollar reserves. Just this week, the CEO of Canadian exchange Coinsquare was forced to resign after the local regulator found the exchange regularly made fake trades on the platform.      ""Our customers love it, the transparency that comes with it,"" Ehrlich said.      Yet another benefit: More listings might allow stock investors to bet on individual or multiple executive teams and strategies within the cryptocurrency industry. That way they're not limited to putting all eggs into the bitcoin basket, as envisioned by proposed issuers of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund, which has yet to win approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.      It goes without saying that a bet on Coinbase would represent a bet on broad growth in digital-asset markets, including ""altcoins"" like ether and litecoin.      Grayscale, which offers cryptocurrency funds known as ""trusts"" that trade like stocks, reported last week that total capital inflows into non-bitcoin products had climbed seven-fold in the past 12 months. (Grayscale is a unit of the investment firm Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)  More stock listings could satiate growing investor appetite for exposure to a broad range of cryptocurrencies, similar to the way a mutual fund might buy a big, vertically integrated energy producer like Exxon for exposure to oil, natural gas, refining and retail distribution — without ever having to venture directly into commodities markets.      In an industry where market-leading companies can get away with not disclosing their headquarters, the trend could help bring a much-needed dose of transparency and trust to the digital-asset space.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $9,561 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,682 | 24-Hr Low: $9,454      Trend: Bitcoin is trading flat so far on Friday, after three consecutive daily gains.      The leading cryptocurrency by market value is changing hands around $9,560, representing a very slight decline on the day. Bitcoin was rejected near $9,700 during Thursday's U.S. trading hours. Prices are still up over 3% on a week-to-date basis.      The weak tone seen at press time could be associated with the renewed risk aversion in traditional markets. The major European stock markets are down over 1% at press time seemingly due to China-U.S. tensions. China has announced the closure of the U.S. consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu in retaliation to the U.S.'s recent decision to shut down Beijing's diplomatic mission in Houston.      While bitcoin may face selling pressure, the immediate bullish bias confirmed by Tuesday's 1.5% gain would be invalidated only if prices find acceptance below $9,480.      A strong bounce from that level would reinforce the immediate bullish bias and shift the focus to $9,800 – the resistance of the trendline falling from the December 2017 to June 2019 highs.      If prices establish a foothold below $9,480, we may see a deeper decline toward $9,150 (July 21 low).",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,"Paddy Baker, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/24/first-mover-cryptos-35t-moment-could-come-from-analog-world-stock-listings,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/23682c1009bbe605b7c4cf66027ade1de47c8318-2048x2331.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Series A was for 16.4% of total equity – 10% newly created – and completed in four months.  It was led by Roger Studer, the former investment head of Vontobel, a private bank that held approximately $215 billion in assets under management at the end of 2019.  A Zug-based financial services provider for the digital asset industry, Bitcoin Suisse said the funding round pushed its valuation to CHF 302.5 million (~$327 million).  Some of the funding will expand the company's lending business and staking services, as well as the custodial solution.  Bitcoin Suisse is applying for a Swiss banking and securities dealer license, as well as a banking license in neighboring Liechtenstein.  A spokesperson told CoinDesk it had set aside funding for new product offerings, should the license applications be successful.  In a statement, Bitcoin Suisse said H1 2020 performance had been strong, with strong growth across its product and service range – the Series A satisfied capital needs for the foreseeable future.  The spokesperson previously told CoinDesk that Bitcoin Suisse had started initial preparations for a public listing – either an IPO or direct listing – for some time in the next few years.  A security token offering (STO) might also be in the works, but this will depend on market demand and Bitcoin Suisse's capital requirements.  The spokesperson told CoinDesk Friday that the Series A put the bank hopeful in a ""good position"" to move ahead with its listing plans.

42432432,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNCLph,1595580694,Central Bank Board Member Says CBDCs Raise More Questions Than Answers,"A board member of the Czech National Bank has provided a less than glowing opinion on the current viability of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).    Tomas Holub told 4H Production journalist Martina Sobkova in a wide-ranging interview on Tuesday that the role CBDCs had in providing direct liquidity to clients' accounts was technically an ""attractive concept.""  However, Holub stopped short of praising CBDCs, which he dubbed ""helicopter money,"" because he hasn't seen a solution that answers outstanding questions surrounding the nature of CBDCs.  Helicopter money is a term used to describe newly printed money that distributed publicly to stimulate an economy in a recession or or at times of zero interest rates.  Those questions included whether digital currency would be anonymous or not, whether anti-money laundering (AML) standards would be applied to the anonymous variant, and if the currencies would be interest-bearing.  When asking these questions, Holub said, many more arise and he has yet to see any CBDC project that provided full, detailed answers.  Holub also took aim at Czech law, which he said lacked the power to give the central bank the authority to issue citizens credit in the form of digital currency due to European legislation standards.  When asked if the Czech Republic would be a pioneer in CBDCs, he said the country's share of currency in circulation is still fairly high and is growing long-term, countering the idea of a liquidity crisis that might prompt such a launch.  Still, a digital currency from the central bank is a future possibility, Holub said.
