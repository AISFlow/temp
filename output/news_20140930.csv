42426099,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIiazh,1412119924,Top Bitcoin VCs Back Coinapult's $775k Funding Round,"Coinapult has raised $775,000 in funding from a group of notable investors and investment firms, including Barry Silbert's Bitcoin Opportunity Corp, angel investor Roger Ver and technology-focused VC firm FirstMark Capital.  The Panama-based bitcoin wallet service provider raised the capital through two rounds of funding, and aims to use the money for additional marketing and product improvements.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Coinapult CFO and COO Justin Blincoe indicated that the biggest benefit for his company will be the expertise of its now-solidified investor group, which he characterized as essential to his company's success in an increasingly crowded bitcoin wallet market.  Blincoe told CoinDesk:  ""The reality of the bitcoin landscape is there are a lot of wallets. It's not difficult to come out with a wallet, it's difficult to have a very good wallet and that's what will separate the wheat from the chaff.""  Lawrence Lenihan, founder and managing director at FirstMark Capital, a VC firm whose past investments include Lumosity, Pinterest and Shopify, was optimistic about Coinapult and its long-term prospects in light of these challenges.  Lenihan, who serves on the board of directors at SecondMarket, told CoinDesk:  ""These are the best of the technologists and tinkerers in the bitcoin world, so it was a no-brainer to be able to take a stake in them.""  Coinapult co-founders Erik Voorhees and Ira Miller also contributed to the round, a development that Blincoe said was meant to help the entrepreneurs solidify their equity positions in the company.  New Payza partnership  Blincoe told CoinDesk that its recently announced bitcoin price volatility solution LOCKS will be the focal point as the company seeks to increase its global user base.  Introduced in July  , LOCKS allows Coinapult customers outside the US to peg the value of bitcoin to the price of gold, silver, US dollars or any other asset, thereby locking in their value should bitcoin's price rise or fall.  Blincoe noted that Coinapult will seek to capitalize on the biggest value-add to LOCKS, its ability to integrate with the offerings of other bitcoin companies.  ""The message is we can integrate with almost any company out there that wants to offer LOCKS. Yes, we have a wallet, yes we're looking to improve it, but for all the other wallet companies out there we can work with them and allow their customers access to this product, which I think is kind of exciting,"" Blincoe said.  As part of the funding news, Coinapult announced a partnership with online payment processor Payza that will allow its customers in 190 countries the ability to access LOCKS without leaving their Payza accounts.  The US market question  Despite the company's growing user base, the introduction of LOCKS comes at a time when the bitcoin industry is increasingly looking to create solutions that can help shield consumers from bitcoin's price swings.  As such, the possibility remains that Coinapult could lose out on the US market, should another competitor aim to introduce a similar solution.  Blincoe, however, is not worried about this development, suggesting that the US market, while potentially boosting the company's short-term enrollment, would not be a key driver of its long-term market strategy.  ""Our strategic planning is that the US isn't going to be the biggest hotbed of bitcoin use in the future. It will be countries and regions that really benefit from bitcoin over the financial services that are offered to them today,"" Blincoe concluded.

42426086,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIiahh,1412115641,"Reddit Raises $50 Million, Plans New Cryptocurrency to Reward Users","Reddit has announced a new $50m funding round that could lead to a unique way for the social network to give back to its community – its own cryptocurrency.  In a post on the company’s official blog, CEO Yishan Wong revealed Reddit had secured funding from a number of well-known venture capitalists and VC funds.  Notable names included Sam Altman, president of the Y Combinator startup incubator, Andreessen Horowitz partner Marc Andreessen, PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, actor Jared Leto, hip-hop superstar Snoop Dogg and Wong himself.  Perhaps most notably for the digital currency community, however, was that all of these investors agreed to set aside 10% of the round’s proceeds to give back to the community.  Wong wrote that the move was a recognition of the central role the digital currency community has played in Reddit’s ongoing success, but provided few details on the company's potential plans.  When asked by CoinDesk to elaborate on the concept, Wong said only:  ""We'll have more to announce in the future.""  The use of digital currency as an ownership token, has long been held as a future use case for block chain technology in general, and the concept is a focal point for many crypto 2.0 projects and frameworks.  Still, Reddit isn't the only major company to announce it intends to experiment with the emerging technology, following similar statements from Overstock in July.  Asset-backed approach  In comments posted on the r/blog subreddit, Wong was more detailed, saying that the company may seek to create a special-purpose cryptocurrency that would be backed by the value of the shares created during the $50m funding round.  Wong explained:  “We are thinking about creating a cryptocurrency and making it exchangeable (backed) by those shares of reddit, and then distributing the currency to the community. The investors have explicitly agreed to this in their investment terms.”  Wong added that he feels the idea is worth the attempt given its potential benefits for site users, but that the company hasn't moved beyond the initial exploration phase with the idea.  Bitcoin-friendly backers  Among those who took part in Reddit’s $50m round are some investors who would no doubt be receptive to the company's use of block chain technology.  Altman’s Y Combinator is no stranger to bitcoin startups, having played patron to bitcoin services provider Coinbase and bitcoin ATM developer BitAccess, among a host of other digital currency startups.  Further, Andreessen Horowitz, has a long history of investing in digital currency startups, and PayPal co-founder Thiel has called bitcoin something that “could become a new phenomenon”.  According to Wong, the caliber of investors Reddit has attracted reflect its long-standing commitment to free speech and open Internet activity.  Wong wrote:  “We have been entrusted with capital by patient, long-term investors who support our views on difficult issues. We believe in free speech, self-governing communities and the power of voting. We find that this freedom yields more good than bad, and we have chosen investors based on this belief.”  Image via Reddit",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/09/30/reddit-raises-50-million-plans-new-cryptocurrency-to-reward-users,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2259ddfa6ead321bbd5f520a0a66b0811a050324-1170x712.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397968,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEvHQ,1412111113,Europol Report Connects Anonymous Digital Currencies to Dark Net Crime,"Europol has issued a new report on Internet crime in which it outlined a number of scenarios involving bitcoin.  Called the Internet Organised Crime Threat Assessment (iOCTA), the report examines the use of bitcoin on various dark web sites, by organised crime and individual actors, and calls digital currencies an ‘enabler’ for cryber-criminals and a challenge for law enforcement.  However, it makes a clear distinction between bitcoin and digital currencies designed with true anonymity in mind, like darkcoin, warning:  “We feel it should concern everyone that the latest cyber currencies are intended to be truly anonymous and to facilitate anonymous transactions. We face a situation where law enforcement may be completely unable to trace even very large criminal transactions.”  The report is in line with Europol’s previous statements and reports on bitcoin. Speaking at a security conference in March, director Rob Wainwright said digital currencies are being used as “an instrument to facilitate crime,” particularly for money laundering.  Dark net, Tor and bitcoin  Europol  finds several instances of digital currency use on child sexual exploitation dark net sites. The agency warns that the relative anonymity of dark net services – made possible by platforms like Tor – has led to a proliferation of various platforms selling and distributing child abuse material (CAM).  In addition to disturbing videos and images, some sites host open forums on evading law enforcement and perpetrating a range of perverse offenses involving children.  Europol notes that such content is usually not exchanged for commercial reasons and that a “good level of trust” is necessary of those wanting to purchase CAM.  The report warns:  “There are instances of CAM being exchanged via ‘Tor mail’ in exchange for bitcoins. Even though most offenders do not exchange CAM for commercial reasons, the valuable significance of the material associated to the anonymity of Tor and bitcoin creates the ideal setting to add a financial benefit to a traditional exchange.”  Europol finds that traditional commercial sexual exploitation of children online (CSECO) has been lower in recent years, and the amount of commercially available CAM is small.  However, SCECO hackers-for-hire are sometimes employed to hack servers and provide hosting for child abuse material. These hackers usually demand payment in bitcoin, but most of them were found to be fraudulent – they would simply take the money and run, without providing any CAM in exchange.  Abused by criminals  Europol points out that decentralised digital currencies such as bitcoin and darkcoin use peer-to-peer networks with little in the way of control. The report notes that digital currencies are generally designed for legitimate use, but they are “heavily abused” by cybercriminals.  The report says that volatility is an issue even for criminals:  “Cybercriminals often favour centralised schemes which, being tied to tangible assets, are inherently more stable compared to cryptocurrencies whose price is often highly volatile due to high levels of speculation. Of the centralised schemes favoured by the criminal community WebMoney is still very popular, particularly for criminal-to-criminal payments, as is Perfect Money to a lesser extent.”  Bitcoin is gaining traction in cybercrime circles, according to the report. Europol cites Silk Road as an example of a bitcoin-based illicit marketplace. The report also says that bitcoin is beginning to “feature heavily in police investigations,” particularly those dealing with ransomware and extortion.  Further, it finds that distrust in centralised schemes has been growing since the takedown of E-Gold in 2009 and the dismantling of Liberty Reserve in 2013. Criminals find cryptocurrencies attractive due to their distributed nature, which makes them resistant to law enforcement disruption and government control.  The iOCTA says that cryptocurrencies are not an ideal match for online crime for a number of reasons:  “The transparency of such systems is a likely deterrent, potentially providing law enforcement with a financial trail to follow. The market is also volatile with currency prices fluctuating significantly and often. Furthermore a number of exchange services were hacked in 2014 with many users losing their online e-wallets with no recourse for compensation.”  Money laundering concerns  Although they may not be the perfect currency for some criminals, Europol warns that digital currencies could “become an ideal instrument” for money laundering.  Criminals can use unregistered dark net exchanges, or try to exploit legitimate exchanges with poor know-your-customer (KYC) controls. Another problem is the rise of ‘tumblers’ and ‘mixers’ – services which allow users to launder their cryptocurrency, while charging a relatively small commission. The report looks into the possibility of using online gambling sites to launder ‘dirty’ cryptocurrency.  Europol concludes that law enforcement needs to pursue the possibility of obtaining evidence from virtual scheme operators – as they would from any other institution – and to be able to freeze and seize funds.  It says:  “Virtual currencies represent an example of technology overtaking legislation. Few jurisdictions recognise virtual currencies as a currency or have managed to adopt adequate regulatory controls.”  The report issues a number of recommendations calling for new EU legislation that would apply anti-money laundering regulations to digital currencies and strengthen relationships with money transfer businesses, banks, law enforcement and digital currency operators.

42397965,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEvDU,1412103615,Robocoin Launches Custom Bitcoin Wallet Targeting Underbanked,"Robocoin  has announced the launch of a custom bitcoin wallet for consumers called the Robocoin Wallet.  The move finds the Las Vegas-based bitcoin services company in the midst of its ongoing evolution away from the bitcoin vending machines that dominate the bitcoin ATM market and toward a global remittance and bitcoin banking platform it calls ""Robocoin 2.0"", first announced in June.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Robocoin CEO Jordan Kelley indicated that the Robocoin Wallet will allow the company to bring more of the essential services for its planned bitcoin banking and remittance network under its direct supervision – a step that will be key in helping the company ensure its service remains as user-friendly as possible.  Kelley said:  ""What we're talking about is a fully enterprise, fully functional global wallet with a full kiosk and bitcoin ATM built into it. What that means for customers is it's no longer about having to have your external bitcoin wallet and having to be at the whims of the existing bitcoin infrastructure.""  Kelley indicated that the wallet is essential to creating a harmonious experience for Robocoin users across its web and mobile platforms.  Emphasising cash advantage  Kelley explained that the principal selling point unique to the new product is the ability for wallet users to instantly convert bitcoins to cash at its locations around the globe:  ""Now, if I want some cash, I'm no longer sending bitcoin to the machine and waiting for the confirmation and then going back and scanning a receipt. All I'm doing is I walk up to the machine, tap 'withdraw', I pick how much money I want and it instantly cashes out.""  Robocoin's wallet will be initially available to all of the company's existing users, who can sign up on the company's website. New customers can sign up from Tuesday at the company's 'Robocoin Branch' (ATM) locations in Los Angeles, Mountain View and Las Vegas, and soon after at branches worldwide.  Removing barriers to entry  The new product is part of a broader move by the company to use its Robocoin ATMs as an onramp to the digital currency ecosystem. As such, Kelley told CoinDesk that it is looking to develop a suite of in-house solutions that free it from third-party relationships that have in the past created operational difficulties.  Kelley described early interactions between customers and bitcoin ATM operators as falling short of the intended user experience, as operators struggled to explain transaction delays from major exchanges to new users.  He recalled:  ""There was just so much stuff outside of our control and really the customers were the ones that had the [poor] experience, and really Robocoin [too], since we're the ones who had to deal with the support.""  By delivering a wallet secured by two-factor authentication and with SMS money-sending capabilities, the company now aims to improve the wallet experience as well, as customers will no longer need to protect their private keys or navigate complex addresses.  In addition to its consumer wallets, Robocoin kiosks will also be powered by the company's previously announced operator wallets, which use an API to automatically replenish funds purchased from exchanges.  Remittance network still in progress  Kelley also discussed the progress his company has made in the months since first announcing its ambitions to pivot toward positioning itself as more than a bitcoin ATM operator and service provider.  Notably, Kelley suggested that, despite his company's aspirations, he believes capitalizing on his company's vision for a global remittance network is still far off.  However, he believes Robocoin has the tools to capture this market, saying:  ""It would be very difficult to imagine a remittance population sending bitcoin or sending money to and from private keys, so honestly we're not seeing remittance, but we believe we can beat Western Union on the fees – we can certainly beat them on the customer experience.""  Kelley concluded by reiterating his belief that Robocoin will one day be able to make more effective commerce possible for the millions of underbanked consumers around the world, and that the firm remains committed to capturing this market segment.

42397978,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEvQH,1412100092,FinCEN Director: We're Not Out to Villainize Bitcoin,"The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has been to date one of the most active – and more controversial – US federal agencies to address the bitcoin ecosystem, doing so through a number of published rulings aiming to provide clarity to the industry.  Founded in 1990, the US agency is responsible for collecting information about financial transactions that may be used to support money laundering, terrorist financing and financial crimes. FinCEN first addressed emerging virtual currencies in 2008 and has been simultaneously praised for engaging with the bitcoin ecosystem, while facing criticism from those who say its efforts have sometimes stifled innovation.  In a new interview with CoinDesk, FinCEN Director Jennifer Shasky Calvery has moved to counter this narrative, reiterating that while her agency's foremost goal is to protect domestic businesses and citizens, FinCEN remains committed to minimizing the burden of bitcoin and digital currency startups that are making good-faith efforts to comply with regulation.  Calvery told CoinDesk:  ""We don't start at a product and villainize a product, we villainize the bad actors and find out what they're doing with their money.""  Further, Calvery said that FinCEN is more broadly seeking to gain the support of the domestic bitcoin ecosystem, suggesting that the industry should seek to demonstrate how the technology could possibly be an aid to law enforcement agencies and organisations such as FinCEN:  ""I would try to put the challenge out to the industry itself. [...] We ask that you think about it from an anti-money laundering (AML) perspective, what could you build in [to the technology]? [...] I would challenge your readers to think about it from our perspective and see if they can't come up with some ideas.""  The comments come as part of wide-ranging interview with CoinDesk in which Calvery discussed developments in the field of digital currency, New York's BitLicense proposal and what FinCEN expects from bitcoin businesses seeking to serve to the US public.  Bitcoin steps up to crime concerns  Throughout the interview, Calvery sought to make clear her belief that bitcoin as a technology is not more susceptible to criminal misuse than other financial services.  Rather, Calvery said that bitcoin's status as a newcomer to the financial ecosystem has made it the target of bad actors.  She suggested that FinCEN believes the bitcoin community is taking steps to combat the technology's use in dark markets and illicit commerce, but that some businesses are actively making it difficult for her agency. Overall, however, her tone was arguably softer than in interviews earlier this year, when Silk Road and its related law enforcement cases dominated headlines.  Calvery said:  ""You see industry responding and trying to put controls on this. So you see industry springing up around some of these things, but at the same time, you also see businesses springing up trying to make it more difficult for law enforcement.""  Calvery indicated that FinCEN is currently researching ring signatures, a cryptographic signature in which an action is attributed only to a group, and tumblers, a type of mixing service meant to hide where transactions originate.  Informal bitcoin dealers on radar  Consistent with its mandate as chief AML regulator for the US, Calvery asserted that all members of the bitcoin ecosystem that fall under FinCEN's guidance should follow its directives.  Of particular concern, Calvery said, are informal bitcoin dealers who may think they can operate outside of the agency's oversight.  ""I hear reports that there are folks who say that they'll wait and see if there's any enforcement behind our requirements before they take it too seriously, so that's unfortunate. I have to hear that folks want to see folks do wrong, and take action before they're willing to comply, but we're willing to do that if we need to,"" she said.  As for how many bitcoin businesses may be following its guidance, Calvery said she can only speculate, given that money services businesses (MSBs) do not need to register as a bitcoin business:  ""Sometimes you can tell from the name or we know who it is, and other times it's not clear, so I can't give you perfect stats on how many have registered.""  However, Calvery aimed to characterize her agency as one that is open to engaging with bitcoin businesses, and said that she has been encouraged by bitcoin startups that have hired experienced AML compliance professionals.  To those without such experienced personnel, Calvery said that the FinCEN Resource Center is available to provide answers within 24 hours. More specific questions, she indicated, will receive written responses to be published on FinCEN's website.  One slice of the pie  Calvery also commented on how FinCEN fits into the broader framework of US regulatory organisations, cautioning that the agency is just one ""slice of a pie"" that includes agencies dedicated to capital markets, consumer protection and safety and soundness.  Calvery suggested that while FinCEN has been a first-mover, other agencies are now beginning to assess how bitcoin and digital currency fall under their mandates, saying:  ""We don't have those slices of the pie at all and certainly a good financial control should include all of those things. Of course, we'd be looking for all the other agencies responsible for those types of concerns to be focused on them and I think we're seeing that grow.""  For its part, Calvery indicated that FinCEN is trying to create a consistent framework across the entire financial ecosystem, one that covers everything from cash to credit cards to bitcoin.  ""I guess we're agnostic in terms of how we think of any industry or product. For us, every industry and product through which value flows provides an opportunity for criminals and bad actors to take advantage of it,"" Calvery added.  BitLicense not technology-specific  Calvery also weighed in on the debate surrounding New York's BitLicense proposal, suggesting that she doesn't believe it to be technology-specific, as some in the industry have alleged.  ""When I looked through it, I saw a lot of concepts that I was already familiar with from New York and other places,"" Calvery said.  Though she commended Ben Lawsky for playing a leadership role on the project, Calvery indicated her belief that the New York regulator, like her own organisation, also needs the support of some other federal agencies.  Calvery told CoinDesk:  ""I would say that we just do the AML here and that there's all these other aspects, whether it's safety and soundness or consumer protection that need to be thought about. Ben Lawsky, from where he sits, is someone who needs to think about several of these other things.""  Cash-like controls on the table  More broadly, Calvery suggested that FinCEN believes that it may need to alter its approach to bitcoin and digital currency should the technology be adopted more widely. Calvery first proposed a similar path forward for the agency at the US Senate hearings on bitcoin last November.  However, her comments suggest that this scenario may still be far into the future, when it becomes possible for larger numbers of individuals to conduct their finances solely in the bitcoin ecosystem.  Calvery said:  ""We might need to start thinking about a different approach, whether that's a more cash-like approach or something else, but it's certainly something we're keeping our eye and trying to keep ahead of it.""

42397962,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEvBW,1412099800,FinCEN Director Jennifer Shasky Calvery: Full CoinDesk Interview,"CoinDesk: How does FinCEN research the bitcoin industry and keep track of developments with the technology?  FinCEN Director Jennifer Shasky Calvery: So, let me start historically, we can go even a little wider with virtual currency. I think we first really started thinking about virtual currency quite a while ago, and it was in response to working with our law enforcement partners and it was back in the days of E-gold and when virtual currencies were backed by a commodity.  So, we came out with our first guidance on virtual currency in September in 2008, and again, it was based mostly on our interaction with law enforcement and their interest in the topic. As we moved forward into 2011, we were starting to think not just about E-gold and virtual currency but at that time everyone was calling it emerging payment methods, and we kind of didn't know what that meant, you know. It's like 'They have these things called cell phones now?' Things are going to change quickly here.  At that time, we were looking at our money services business definition, to make it clear that's value that's substituted for currency is something that would fit within in our money transmission rules in particular. It wouldn't just be currency or monetary instruments but value that's substituted for currency that became the topic for us, and that's what really gave us the flexibility as we saw cryptocurrencies and digital currencies coming on the scene to be able to cover those as well as virtual currencies like a Liberty Reserve system.  In March 2013, we came out with our guidance on virtual currencies, both those that are centralized and decentralized whether digital or otherwise, and still we were focused on it in many respects with law enforcements and their concerns to have some sort of regulatory control around this, because our regulatory space is AML and combating the financing of terrorism. So our relationships with law enforcement is very important and we wanted to make sure we had some controls in this space. We were already worried, they were already seeing things. That's kind of the historical piece to it.  Bitcoin, in particular, because we've been watching virtual currency and talking to law enforcement. You'd have to have your head under a rock in this country not to see the rise of bitcoin in the the news and so forth. We follow it anyway we can. We have an intelligence division here at FinCEN that's made up of analysts that review the reporting we receive from financial institutions and other sources, what we call our Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) reporting or BSA reporting. They're constantly looking at that. We also follow the public news out there about bitcoin. We pretty much read everything we can get our hands on, we talk to folks in the industry.  We do have a bitcoin related company as a member of our BSA advisory group. We schedule meetings with industry to try to understand. I made a trip earlier this year out West to meet with a bunch of digital currency companies out there to learn more and understand more, so we just try to figure out what we can in as many different ways as we possibly can.  CoinDesk: Bitcoin as a technology has enabled online dark markets, we saw this with Silk Road, and its a phenomenon that still exists, those markets are still around. Has bitcoin made this problem worse?  Jennifer Shasky Calvery: First any type of institution, any type of financial product can be exploited and abused by criminals and other bad actors and often are, quite frankly. New products or new types of financial service institutions are particularly vulnerable in their early days. Because you have a lot of members of the public who don't understand it and oftentimes we find that criminals and other bad actors will learn it quickly and take advantage of some of the mysteries around it, or some of the lack of controls that aren't yet in place.  That's one of the great gifts of our criminal community, they find the loopholes and vulnerabilities and we learn from that. In that respect, bitcoin as a relatively new thing faces those challenges and those vulnerabilities. As for bitcoin, specifically, and some of the attributes of it, I think those things happen, and I think we've seen that some of the pseudonymity and the fact that you can't reverse transactions, some of those aspects of it have been exploited by bad actors, and you see industry responding and trying to put controls on this. So you see industry springing up around some of these things, but at the same time, you also businesses springing up trying to make it more difficult for law enforcement.  Some purposely so, actively targeted at making it difficult for law enforcement to trace any money and others as a byproduct. These are things that remain a challenge for law enforcement as we think through ring signatures and tumblers and dark markets and all these types of things.  CoinDesk: You mentioned the newness of the market. Is FinCEN looking to other agencies to step in and set better boundaries in terms of how the technology can be used?  Jennifer Shasky Calvery: There's two different avenues for answering that. The first is the broader regulatory events, so as I mentioned we're a regulator for anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism, and that's our slice of the pie. But there are many other concerns for which we have regulatory agencies in the financial space, around safety and soundness, consumer protection, protecting markets, the capital markets, etc.  We don't have those slices of the pie at all and certainly a good financial control should include all of those things. Of course, we'd be looking for all the other agencies responsible for those types of concerns to be focused on them and I think we're seeing that grow.  Likewise, internationally we are the AML regulator for the US, but there are all these AML regulators around the globe, and we're seeing these agencies start to think through these issues, and that's just what's in our little slice of the pie. We're not the only operator here, we partner with a lot of other agencies, and in this space, the states. States regulate money transmission and so do we from an AML perspective.  So we seek to partner and try not to be duplicative and cooperate.  CoinDesk: You talked about AML/KYC, and those are big topics in our industry as it looks to show it can self-regulate. What advice would you give to bitcoin business that want to show they are good actors in the space?  Jennifer Shasky Calvery: Well, first and foremost if they're an MSB under our rules, they need to register with FinCEN and that's step one, and we've had several bitcoin businesses register with us. Our registration list is actually public, but it's not always obvious who is in the bitcoin businesses.  They only have to check MSB or money transmitter, they don't have to go down to the level of bitcoin or digital currency or something more. But, sometimes you can tell from the name or we know who it is, and other times it's not clear, so I can't give you perfect stats on how many have registered.  Then in terms of what we expect, we have reporting obligations, we have obligations that they have an AML program in place and our rules define that out, but on a bigger note, what I see in the industry is I see players in the industry who are trying their best to comply with our regulations and are hiring experienced AML compliance professionals to come and help them stand up their programs. I see that as a very encouraging sign.  On the discouraging sign, we're concerned about informal bitcoin dealers who fall under our regulation as an exchange who are not registering and are thinking they're operating under the radar. I also hear reports that there are folks who say that they'll wait and see if there's any enforcement behind our requirements before they take it too seriously, so that's unfortunate. I have to hear that folks want to see folks do wrong, and take action before their willing to comply, but we're willing to do that if we need to.  CoinDesk: Bitcoin has attracted a lot of ideologies that are more libertarian or anti-regulation. Does you worry about these aspects of the space?  Jennifer Shasky Calvery: I think there is a certain ideological bent to certain parts of the industry that is more anti-establishment, anti-regulation. I also see gaps in the spectrum. It is not a single industry in terms of ideologies and the spectrum, there doesn't seem to be any one way of thinking. But, when I think of folks who are libertarian or anti-regulation in bent, maybe that just highlights our need to explain to the American public why we need to have regulation. It's there to defend our country, our businesses, our people for any number of actors who would harm them for any number of reasons.  Regulations have grown up around something bad happens and then folks say we should regulate and make sure this never happens again. We are focused on trying to protect our businesses, our people and our country while minimizing the burden on those who are trying to do things the right way, so it's a balancing act for us and it's a constant, I think we have a constant need and obligation to communicate why this regulation is important.  CoinDesk: FinCEN has been vocal about ensuring bitcoin companies understand how they fit under existing rules. How do you decide when to issue certain groups in the industry guidance?    Jennifer Shasky Calvery: I guess with any particular subset of the industry and those in the industry, we make our decisions there based on a particular entity, and what we're trying to do is have a consistent framework across the entire financial ecosystem of which bitcoin and virtual currency are just one piece.  There's cash and credit cards and all these other things we have out there that make up our payment system and financial ecosystem, and we're looking to have a common set of controls as much as possible across the ecosystem for lack of a better word so that different businesses can operate and so forth and feel like they're being treated alike, and we can also see which controls seem to be adequate and learn from those and apply them to different areas, so our approach is to try to be as consistent as we can across the board to minimize the burden on industry as much as possible while putting controls in place that are going to be effective.  But, to the extent that your readers are going to have questions about any particular business model and how our rules might apply to them, they have a couple of options, one is to call the FinCEN Resource Center, and that's up on our website, at FinCEN.gov, they can email in and call in, we have folks that are standing by that take questions and no matter how complicated they are, they can usually get them an answer within 24 hours because that beats them going to do the research themselves.  For the really specific question kind of questions where you need a written answer, we have an administrative ruling process, and you see some of those publically on the website, those are the things you see for miners and so forth, where someone wrote in and asked a very specific question that we thought there are probably a lot of folks out there with the same question so why don't we publish it.  CoinDesk: Ben Lawsky has been on the record in New York, taking the stance that bitcoin might not be anymore prone to illicit activity than the traditional financial network. Does FinCEN support that opinion?    Jennifer Shasky Calvery: I guess we're agnostic in terms of how we think of any industry or product. For us, every industry and product through which value flows provides an opportunity for criminals and bad actors to take advantage of it.  So, for us, it's about putting controls around it and understanding how it's exploited, especially by the bad actors that we care the most about, drug trafficking organizations, organized crime, cyberthreats, ISLE threats, whatever you're reading about in the papers everyday as the biggest threats facing the US. For us, we start there to learn how they're laundering money.  We don't start at a product and villainize a product, we villianize the bad actors and find out what they're doing with their money.  CoinDesk: One of FinCEN's mandates is to follow the movement of illicit funds. Has your organisation looked at bitcoin and its underlying ledger technology as something that could solve problems for law enforcement?    Jennifer Shasky Calvery: I think we're very interested in how technology can help us to understand and track money, and there's a number of ways, including the technology that is underlying digital currencies, and that's based in trying to understand how the technology can be helpful in anti-money laundering.  I would try to put the challenge out to the industry itself. You're the ones who know this technology, that know these products you're building up better than anyone else. You're the creative folks that can come up with something like a bitcoin, so if we take that creativity and technical knowledge you have, we ask that you think about it from an anti-money laundering perspective, what could you build in, what should you be thinking about and I do feel like there have been some figures out there on this topic, but I also feel like there is a lot more work that can be done.  I would challenge your readers to think about it from our perspective, and see if they can't come up with some ideas.  CoinDesk: With New York and its BitLicense proposal, it seems that the FinCEN approach has been to apply existing laws to the bitcoin industry, whereas something like the BitLicense seems to introduce industry-specific rules. Does FinCEN think more states should be taking this approach?    Jennifer Shasky Calvery: I'm not sure that I agree that what New York has done has gone that far away from established ways of regulating the financial industry. When I looked through it, I saw a lot of concepts that I was already familiar with from New York and other places.  That being said, I think your larger point, I would say that we just do the anti-money laundering here and that there's all these other aspects, whether it's safety and soundness or consumer protection that need to be thought about.  Ben Lawsky, from where he sits, is someone who needs to think about several of these other things, and just like FinCEN was, as best as I can tell, the first regulator to come out and talk about virtual currency in the AML regulatory realm, I commend Ben Lawsky for coming out and playing a leadership role in many of these other areas, certainly amongst the states in thinking about this issue.  In terms of where it goes, I understand that he extended the comment period. It'll be interesting for them to see all the comments they get and what they can learn from that, and hopefully craft the strongest regulations possible.  I know a lot of other states are thinking about this as well and really putting a lot of effort into understanding the industry and what their approach should be. In fact, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS), they have taken on the issue as well, so I think our states are committed to doing their best to get it right on all the different regulatory fronts that they're responsible for.  We look forward to working with them because they're definitely a partner of ours.  CoinDesk: Talking finally about one of the broader goals of the ecosystem, to decentralize a lot of the financial systems that we're more familiar with. Do you think law enforcement will be able to keep up with this transition?    Jennifer Shasky Calvery: I think we're comfortable with where we are on the regulatory front given the current level of development of bitcoin.  We're also very cognizant that if it's adopted more broadly and it really becomes possible for individuals to operate entirely within bitcoin or digital currencies in a more meaningful mainstream way, that we might need to start thinking about a different approach, whether that's a more cash-like approach or something else, but it's certainly something we're keeping our eye and trying to keep ahead of it.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2014/09/30/fincen-director-jennifer-shasky-calvery-full-coindesk-interview,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9699e4ddf943844d46552f00724a5a6f29609ed2-1167x700.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397980,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEvTE,1412099417,Chomping at the Bitcoin: An Expert's Take on Bitcoin in China,"Around mid to late 2013, the bitcoin world started waking up to an interesting realization: bitcoin growth wasn't being driven by the typical finance and tech centers of New York, London or Silicon Valley. In fact, China was playing the more significant role.  At that time, exchange BTC China had already posted the record-high bitcoin price of $308 (CNY equivalent) in April 2013 and was surpassing Mt Gox in trade volumes. Chinese factories were cranking out mining machines and the country's residents were downloading more bitcoin wallets than anyone else in the world.  In November, China was leading the global rise of bitcoin, as its price was growing exponentially. The digital currency hit its all-time high of over $1,230 a few weeks later.  Then, on 5th December, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) entered the narrative with a warning for all financial institutions to steer clear of bitcoin, the first of many that effectively ended bitcoin's chances at becoming part of China's everyday economy. Bitcoin's price fell 25% at the news, and the rest is history.  These days, the country is known for having the world's busiest trading exchanges and ASIC-filled mining mega-farmshttp://www.thecoinsman.com/2014/08/bitcoin/inside-one-worlds-largest-bitcoin-mines/. As one local investor said: ""Trust China to turn bitcoin into another manufacturing industry.""  Mixed forecast  In the aforementioned bitcoin in China feature, CoinDesk spoke to Zennon Kapron, a Canadian-born financial technology expert and owner of the Shanghai-based consultancy Kapronasia.  Kapron has since turned his observations into a new book called Chomping at the Bitcoin, titled similarly to presentations he gave in late 2013, in which he looked at China's investment environment, the mining scene and gave a prescient warning about government intervention.  While the book remains optimistic about bitcoin's potential as a disruptive technology, Kapron is slightly downcast on its short-term prospects for success in China.  Considering the rarity of credit card chargebacks and the low fees available for existing payment options in the country, there just isn't a compelling use case, he wrote. Speculators, meanwhile, have moved on to other investment opportunities.  As for the PBOC's intentions, Kapron said bitcoin probably ""got in the way"" of the Chinese authorities' ""cautious and pragmatic approach"" to economic reform. The more successful digital currencies threatened to become, the greater their potential to destabilize China's growth and its citizens' financial wellbeing.  Cryptocurrency's role  The notion that wealthy Chinese would use bitcoin as a means to bypass strict capital controls on the yuan were probably exaggerated, Kapron said.  Chinese are still allowed to move the equivalent of $50,000 out of the country per year, and those who managed to hit that limit could avail themselves of advisors and overseas connections to shift funds in one business day for a less than 1% fee – cheaper than bitcoin exchanges.  Bitcoin, where it is used publicly, is still chiefly a marketing stunt. China's main contributions to the global bitcoin ecosystem remain mining and trading. Significant roles they may be, but not likely to cause a financial revolution in their homeland by themselves.  The future of bitcoin in China is like the rest of the world, Kapron concluded. It must move beyond being a speculative tool hoarded by users and become something actually useful in daily transactions.  Bitcoin in China  CoinDesk spoke to Kapron for a second time to discover the reasons for his continued interest in bitcoin's Chinese presence and his views on its foreseeable future in the country.  CoinDesk: Why did you decide to write the book?  Zennon Kapron: We started covering bitcoin in China around June of last year and so saw the massive run-up in bitcoin price, the regulations, and then the subsequent fall in value. In our research, we met and talked with a number of industry people who had really interesting stories about how they had been involved with speculation, mining or actually accepting bitcoin.  That was the first feeling that I had that it could be bigger than just a research report. In addition, while coverage at Coindesk and all the other publications that look at bitcoin in China was good, no one had really told the whole story in one sitting – and that is how everything got started.  Can China play an adequate role in world bitcoin development merely by providing mining factories, ATM hardware and speculative exchanges?  China needs to be part of the global bitcoin story if the virtual currency is to be successful in the long term, but it remains to be seen if and when that happens.  We do have some of the most advanced and sophisticated exchanges globally here in China and, of course, some of the biggest mining equipment manufacturers and mining operations.These all play a part in the global ecosystem, but right now there's not much being done to develop the basic usage of bitcoin domestically.  Is it actually necessary for China build a full local bitcoin-based ecosystem? Or do the existing centralized payment platforms there work well (and economically) enough?  That's the challenge for bitcoin globally and more specifically in China: what problem does or can it solve? Merchant fees in China are low compared to the West and platforms like Alipay and WeChat/Tenpay have the mobile and non-bank payment market here wrapped up, so there's not too much opportunity there.  Bitcoin doesn't have enough critical mass to be a store of value at this point beyond the miners and early adopters, so also not very appealing there. Could we see China continue to just innovate with exchanges and mining? Certainly.  You said reports that wealthy Chinese are using bitcoin to move money abroad are overblown. What, if anything, might change that?  I really don't see that changing. If anything, regulations on the cross-border flow of RMB are loosening, which would indicate that moving money around will be easier in the future. In addition, with programs like the HK-Shanghai stock connect being setup, Chinese nationals have new choices and venues through which to invest. The need to use something like bitcoin to move money abroad is diminishing.  Do larger, more powerful countries (eg: China and the US) have more to lose by allowing bitcoin to run free?  For larger more mature financial industries and economies, bitcoin certainly has some risks, but manageable risks. China's financial system has its own challenges right now. Shadow lending, credit quality and liquidity are all issues that are top of mind for regulators.  I think the regulators see bitcoin as more of a risk than something that is completely necessary for the economic progress of the country, so they pushed it to the side for now and largely eliminated the direct risk to the financial system. Chinese regulators are not known for backtracking on regulation especially in the financial industry, so I doubt we'll see any change in this positioning unless acceptance and usage really starts to pick up [outside] China.  You said short-term returns and lack of creativity ""will be central to bitcoin's undoing in China"". Will bitcoin come undone in China? Some parts of your book seem to take bitcoin's failure there as a given. Is that the case?  It's challenging. For bitcoin to be successful globally, it needs to solve a specific problem or set of problems. In China, we may be putting the cart before the horse. We have innovative exchanges and miners, which is great, but what about the purpose of bitcoin itself?  What concerns me is that there is not enough focus in China with making bitcoin accessible and useful for the masses, rather than a select group who just mine and speculate. Until that changes, bitcoin will always remain a side-story in China.  Would you personally invest in any current bitcoin related ventures? And if so, what kind?  Although we work directly with a number of bitcoin startups both here in China and abroad, we don't invest directly.  That being said, trade and international payments are two areas that we are particularly interested in as both pose significant challenges for large and small companies alike. We like companies that are focused on B2B business models especially with trade, and definitely see it as an opportunity for bitcoin globally.

42397976,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEvOJ,1412091769,"CoinCorner Launches Mobile Wallet, POS Solution and Payment Gateway","CoinCorner, operator of the first cryptocurrency exchange on the Isle of Man, has announced the launch of three new services – all part of an incremental update of the exchange's platform.  The new version of CoinCorner’s bitcoin platform delivers a new mobile wallet app, a free payment gateway and a point of sale (POS) system. The new services are free to use, but CoinCorner will maintain its fee on bitcoin to fiat conversion.  Multi-cryptocurrency wallet  The mobile wallet – which is free and available for both Android and Apple iOS devices – allows users to buy, sell, send and receive bitcoin, litecoin and dogecoin. CoinCorner describes it as the world’s first multi-currency wallet that allows people to buy and sell cryptocurrency for GBP.  The exchange’s free-to-use payment gateway allows businesses to integrate bitcoin payments on their websites free of charge, converting received bitcoin into GBP on CoinCorner if they so choose.  The firm's free POS solution relies on off-the-shelf hardware in the form of Android tablets. Merchants can simply download the software and turn their device into a bitcoin POS device. Customers can pay using any mobile bitcoin wallet, while again the retailer can automatically convert BTC to GBP or retain bitcoins instead.  Boosting bitcoin adoption  CoinCorner chief technology officer Daniel Scott said the new functionality offered by its updated platform should help increase consumer adoption.  Scott explained CoinCorner’s business model:  “Our new platform makes it easier for consumers to spend bitcoin and easier for retailers and online merchants to accept bitcoin. We only make a small fee if merchants and retailers choose to convert their bitcoin into GBP, otherwise the services are 100% free.”  Phil Collins, the firm's chief operating officer, said the company had listened to its clients and developed the services they were asking for, adding that the early response to the mobile app was “extremely positive”.  “The additional services are a natural extension our core cryptocurrency exchange and enable us to give our clients a more complete experience without the need for lots of different service providers,” he said.  Going for the British market  Although CoinCorner is incorporated in the Isle of Man, the company's primary focus is on the UK and Europe. The exchange is open to all European consumers, but fiat transfers from the European mainland can take between two and five days, incurring standard bank fees in the process.  Other UK-based companies with cross-channel aspirations also have to deal with similar issues. A recent poll carried out by Coinfloor revealed that most users want faster and cheaper fiat transfers.  Although region specific fast payments schemes can be employed, international transfers between all European countries still remain relatively slow.  Bittylicious  is another UK bitcoin platform with international ambitions.

42397979,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEvSF,1412082075,CoinSpark's Bitcoin 2.0 Platform Aims to Simplify Asset Transfers,"A new platform capable of transferring almost anything over bitcoin’s block chain is aiming to innovate on competing ‘2.0’ offerings from ChromaWallet, CoinPrism, Counterparty and MasterCoin.  CoinSpark  , the first software tool available from Coin Sciences, seeks to provide an easy way for users to create and distribute digital assets.  The platform generates asset web pages and enforceable legal contracts for users automatically. Next, all units of the asset are sent to a lightweight wallet for Linux, Mac and Windows, which lives on the issuer's computer, not a hosted web wallet.  The end result, according to Coin Sciences CEO and founder Gideon Greenspan, is a web-like approach to asset transfer that removes the need for end users' wallets to store or review a large quantity of bitcoin transactions.  Greenspan told CoinDesk:  ""We believe that bitcoin wallets should work just like your web browser – light on the client side, and enabling direct interaction with millions of different providers.""  Greenspan compared CoinSpark to a complex web application like Facebook, which allow users to interface with its many features without requiring ISPs to have a complete copy of the social network on their servers.  Key to this approach will be a unique property to CoinSpark called ""asset independence"" that allows the movements of one asset to be tracked across bitcoin transactions while effectively ignoring the movements of other assets.  Based in Tel Aviv, CoinSpark is the latest project for Greenspan, an established developer who has worked on a wide variety of web projects, including Web Sudoku, an online version of the popular puzzle game, and Cloudlook, a project that measures the performance of cloud servers.  Unlocking fiat's digital potential  Following its launch, CoinSpark will compete against crypto 2.0 projects such as Counterparty and MasterCoin. The platform will let users trade bitcoin and other assets over the bitcoin block chain with direct peer-to-peer transactions.  On a technical level, Greenspan said this will simplify asset exchanges, which could be completed in a single bitcoin transaction, rather than being posted in one transaction and confirmed in another.  However, Greenspan suggested that CoinSpark will target more established issuers by offering pre-written contract templates, effectively giving users the ability to operate independently of any third-party while using the platform.  For this reason, CoinSpark could help play a role in helping extend the benefits of bitcoin's ledger technology to fiat currencies, he said, adding:  ""I think the most compelling use case [for CoinSpark] is for governments to issue some of their currency in digital form. Just like you can hold physical US government dollars in your physical wallet, I think you should be able to hold some digital US government dollars in your digital wallet.""  This ability to move fiat money, Greenspan asserted, will help CoinSpark try to solve an issue affecting many asset exchange platforms – namely, how will it incentivize people to use the platform?  ""The key missing element for cryptocurrency trading platforms is a fiat-denominated digital asset issued by a well-known entity with a strong reputation,"" he said.  Lowering asset transfer fees  Greenspan further suggested that CoinSpark will offer users a cost saving when compared to traditional colored coins, which also allow assets to be exchanged directly via bitcoin's block chain.  Colored coins, Greenspan suggested, do permit direct peer-to-peer exchanges between bitcoin and other assets, but tie the quantity of the asset to the total amount of bitcoin needed to execute the transaction.  CoinSpark, he said, aims to allow any quantity of asset to be transferred with a single transaction fee for miners:  ""As a result the cost for any CoinSpark exchange transaction, of any value, will be no more than a single regular bitcoin transaction fee (currently $0.04).""  CoinSpark will notably not require the purchase of non-bitcoin tokens. By comparison, MasterCoin requires users to hold its native currency MSC in order to buy or sell that property on its exchange.  OP_RETURN advantage  CoinSpark is able to achieve its functionality by utilizing OP_RETURN outputs, an update to the Bitcoin protocol introduced earlier this year that allows users to embed 40 bytes of data into a block chain transaction record. At the time, the update was hailed by core developers as a way to enable a new wave of smart contracts.  CoinSpark is encouraging other wallets to support the protocol by providing software libraries in five languages alongside a detailed developers’ guide.  To create an asset through CoinSpark, the platform offers a web form that requires users to provide information such as the asset name, asset description and asset quantity, alongside such features as the divisibility of the unit and the governing law for the asset.  Assets can also be set to expire in as little as one month or as long as 20 years.  Greenspan concluded by acknowledging the debate surrounding whether crypto 2.0 applications are weighing down bitcoin's network with non-essentially data, but asserting that projects like CoinSpark add real value and innovation to the ecosystem.  He told CoinDesk:  ""I believe, there are compelling applications for this metadata, but bitcoin adopts a restrictive policy, creative ideas will naturally move to a cryptocurrency with a more liberal approach. That would be a loss, both financially and ideologically, for the bitcoin community as a whole.""

42397974,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEvNK,1412079488,Aegis Wallet Brings Bitcoin to Android Smartwatches,"The Aegis bitcoin wallet now includes support for Android Wear – Google’s new operating system (OS) for wearable devices – making it the first available bitcoin wallet for the platform.  For now, Aegis Wallet Wear brings limited wallet functionality to Android wearables and lacks the ability to make payments, but the smartwatch form factor promises a number of new possibilities for bitcoin users in the near future.  Additionally, since it is a free, open-source project, developers can use Aegis' code in their own projects.  While Google’s new platform is still very young – Android Wear launched just six months ago and adoption is still limited – the trickle of smart watches using its OS is likely to turn into a torrent in coming months.  A wallet on your wrist  A number of Android Wear watches are in the pipeline, with a few models already shipping. Aegis' app is designed to work on all of them, its developers say, including round-form devices such as Motorola’s Moto 360 and LG’s G Watch R.  The app allows users to keep track of the bitcoin price and the user's wallet balance, as well as delivering relevant notifications, such as sending an alert when bitcoin transactions have occurred.  If the user wishes to receive a payment, the watch can also be used to display a QR code with the bitcoin address of the wallet. However, payments cannot yet be made with the app due to limitations of the host watches.  'Touchless' NFC functionality could potentially prove a useful addition for making transactions between devices and transacting with merchant point-of-sales systems, but is lacking for the time being.  Bojan Simic, the founder of the open-source Bitcoin Security Project and developer of Aegis Wallet, explains:  “At the moment, Android watches lack NFC functionality, so that is certainly a limiting factor. However, it would be great if we could present a bitcoin transaction as a QR code and have a cashier scan our watch. Existing payment systems such as LevelUp do this already, and it would be great to implement the same for bitcoin payments.”  Simic pointed out that this feature would require support from merchants and existing payment platforms, but indicated that the firm has plans to implement it in its wearable wallet anyway.  Simic said he believes wearables have the potential to change a number of industries and bring new authentication technologies to mainstream users.  He pointed to the Nymi smart wristband, which tracks the user’s electrocardiogram (ECG) for authentication, as an example of a security-focused wearable. In the future, smartwatches, wristband and glasses will help people keep their money and personal data more secure, said Simic, adding:  “Bitcoin is certainly only one application for two-factor authentication using wearables and there are limitless possibilities ranging from turning on cars to opening doors. I'm sure that there are also countless possibilities we haven't even thought of yet.”  Limited battery life, which plagues the current generation of smart wearable devices, is not a big concern in the long run, he said. Wearables are becoming increasingly efficient and these days people often have access to a charger anywhere they go.  Simic also pointed out that he and his team work on bitcoin projects for no financial gain and are committed to keeping their software open source, as their contribution to the bitcoin community.

Hochberg told CoinDesk:  “Our engaging bitcoin was a recognition there’s a fast-growing, innovative, passionate group of people looking to make charitable donations based on the interest in using this currency. We wanted to be at the forefront of that conversation.”  The United Way Innovation Fund is a division of the charity dedicated to updating solving global challenges with new technologies and innovations.  Investing in innovation  Hochberg called the integration a pathway for investing and donating to the fund and its larger goal of using technology, relationships and efficiency to power change in the social sector.  He said it was the innovation team that helped steer the rest of the organisation toward a greater understanding of bitcoin and the opportunity the technology presented for United Way’s operations.  However, this is a learning process for the organisation, Hochberg said, not necessarily a point of view on bitcoin. Rather, United Way saw enough potential in the bitcoin community to motivate it to become marketable to that group.  Hochberg explained:  “Our first lend was not so much trying to move everybody as it was making sure that for this small but growing group of bitcoin users that we were early, attractive and engaged. […] Obviously by accepting it, it is an acknowledgement that this is growing in interest and relevancy.”  However, he added: “I would anticipate United Way opening up other parts of our program – other kinds of direct work – through bitcoin at some point.”  Engaging millions  Hochberg said that, for the United Way, bitcoin is a way to bolster individual contributions.  Looking to the future, he said, people want to engage participate in philanthropic work and opportunities more and more. They often do so through their employers, but its becoming increasingly easy to get information and drive their community work as an individual.  He added:  “The whole idea is to engage millions of people to become part of the solution. At the core, that's where our interest in becoming attractive to bitcoin users came from.”  Hochberg also acknowledged the possibility that United Way’s supporters could eventually learn about and embrace bitcoin through its support.
