42382562,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sBFz,1566601259,Circle CEO: China’s Digital Currency Could 'Bypass' Western Banks,"Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire says the U.S. lagging behind China's development of a national digital currency could alter the way Western companies transfer payments.  Speaking on the Global Coin Research podcast this week, Allaire said China is setting the pace in the development of a digital currency equivalent of its fiat currency, the renminbi, and could soon bypass Western rules through direct settlements. Allaire also said Circle continues to be interested in the development of stablecoins, such as its USD Coin.  “[Circle] also believes that the major reserve currencies of the world, the major trade currencies of the world, would become digital currencies,” Allaire said.  “A digital currency version of renminbi that runs on software platforms that can be run over the internet, it really creates an opportunity for China and Chinese companies . . . and bypass the western banking system.”  Earlier this month, the People’s Bank of China announced it was wrapping up a year-long digital currency project.  Allaire said Circle, which launched a U.S. dollar stablecoin in 2018, is keeping its eye on China’s development. A digital renminbi, Allaire said, makes sense in view of the larger global financial picture:  “I think the broader concept of the internationalization of the yuan and the belt and road initiative and the desire to expand China role as a trade counterparty . . . digital currency is a natural path for that to grow.”  Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire via CoinDesk archives",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/08/23/circle-ceo-chinas-digital-currency-could-bypass-western-banks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4e4acf40c95f541a89162447c98942ccf2a6be05-2504x1468.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382591,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sBJl,1566597653,Blockchain Will Integrate BitPay's System For Wallet Payments,"Bitcoin wallet and blockchain explorer provider Blockchain announced a partnership with the largest bitcoin processor, BitPay.  According to a blog post published today, Blockchain will integrate BitPay’s payment architecture into its wallet service. This partnership will allow Blockchain wallet users to pay merchants online or on mobile.  BitPay processes approximately $1 billion in bitcoin alone every year for businesses and individual clients and over $2.8 billion in other cryptos for institutional clients since 2011. The firm has built an ecosystem of merchants that accept their payments – including Amazon, Delta, and Hotels.com – because, as a payment processor, it offers the option to settle in fiat currencies and provides invoices.  Likewise, Blockchain is often regarded as one of the world’s largest wallet providers with approximately 38 million users, of which more than half are located outside the United States. Further, the firm’s wallet users account for roughly a quarter of all on-chain bitcoin transactions.  “We’re excited to see this new addition connect our Wallet users to the world of merchants that accept Bitcoin (and soon other cryptos) as a payment method — one of the key ways to interact with and grow the digital asset ecosystem,” Blockchain writes in a statement.  Blockchain’s wallet service is non-custodial and offers an optional know-your-customer (KYC) verification for users who want in-wallet trading capabilities. Whereas, BitPay requires its users to undergo KYC requirements.  In July, Blockchain unveiled its crypto exchange platform the PIT, with optionality to connect the firms wallets for nearly instant transfers.

42382568,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sBNX,1566594052,Rep. Waters Says Congress Will Continue Review of Facebook's Libra,"The chairwoman of the U.S. House Financial Services Committee has said that the body will continue scrutinizing Facebook's cryptocurrency, Libra.  Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA) released a statement on August 23 that provided a planned schedule for fall 2019. Included on the list is a pledge to carry on with a review of Libra as well as the wallet software being developed by Calibra, a Facebook subsidiary.  Waters has long called for more regulatory scrutiny of the Menlo Park-based social media giant’s leap into the digital asset space.  In June, Waters called for a moratorium and congressional examination of the project, just two days after the Libra Association – a consortium of 28 corporate, non-profit, and regulatory bodies overseeing Libra’s development and release – made their announcement.  In July, she and ranking congressional members furthered this line of inquiry which included a public grilling of Facebook's Libra project head David Marcus.  She asked:  “Will you stop dancing around this question and commit here in this committee … to a moratorium until Congress enacts an appropriate legal framework to ensure that Libra and Calibra do what you claim it will do?”  For his part, Secretary Steve Mnuchin said in the wake of Libra's launch that the project raises significant concerns regarding monetary policy and international finance. He referred to the concerns potential facilitation of terrorist financing, money laundering, and human and drug trafficking as a national security issue.  Marcus said Libra will meet all the necessary regulatory qualifications for the countries it intends to operate in.

42382582,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sBcd,1566594043,Maker Foundation Tried and Failed to Register 'DEFI' Trademark,"In a bid to keep the decentralized finance space free of scam artists, DeFi ecosystem Maker attempted to trademark the term ""DEFI.""  According to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), the Maker Ecosystem Growth Foundation registered a trademark application for DEFI last January. Slang for 'decentralized finance,' the trademark was not granted and Maker is no longer seeking the application.  The filing defined DEFI as a source for “online currency marketplace services, namely, providing a marketplace for trading digital assets.”  The Maker Foundation services a decentralized finance ecosystem consisting of two ERC-20 tokens, the dai (DAI) stablecoin and maker (MKR).  Speaking with CoinDesk, a representative of Maker said it tried to trademark the word for the betterment of the ecosystem:  ""The Maker Foundation applied to trademark 'DeFi' with the goal of making it freely available for the whole community to use while also protecting the trademark from being captured by bad actors. We saw other projects trying to trademark 'stablecoin' and didn't want that to happen here as well.  The organization added: ""It's important to know that the Maker Foundation has not been granted the trademark for DeFi and will no longer pursue the mark. We understand that the community is capable of protecting itself. We apologize for any confusion or misunderstanding.""  Maker's Not Alone  Under current law, the responsibility of defending trademarks falls on the holder of the trademark. Maker, then, would have held the responsibility to defend its trademark in the court of public opinion.  Speaking with CoinDesk, alternative DeFi protocol Dharma applauded the effort:  ""We’re glad that Maker took the steps to prevent rent-seekers from exploiting what is clearly a community-driven meme,"" said Dharma's Max Bronstein. ""The term 'DeFi' was always intended to be owned and operated by the community, and it's good that one of the most honest teams in the space has the legal resources required to protect the movement's integrity.  Number of DeFi Products Growing  Recent visual representations from Alethio show the explosion of decentralized finance products over the last nine months.  DeFi protocols can offer a variety of products, from lending to borrowing to trading.  While the number of products is growing, Maker still holds a competitive edge in terms of ether locked up in contracts. The amount of funds locked in contracts can be used as a proxy of demand for DeFi products.  As of August 23, Maker held some 1.4 million ether in contracts worth an estimated $272 million at press time. Comparatively, alternative protocol Compound held some $102 million locked in ether contracts.

42382561,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sBEj,1566591435,UK Central Bank Chief Sees Digital Currency Displacing US Dollar as Global Reserve,"A central bank-supported digital currency could replace the dollar as the global hedge currency, said Bank of England governor Mark Carney.  Speaking at the Economic Policy Symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Friday Carney discussed the need for a new international monetary and financial system (IMFS), noting that while the U.S. dollar has played a dominant role in the world order over much the past century, recent developments such as increased globalization and trade disputes may have stronger impacts on national economies at the present moment than they would have in the past.  Carney highlighted the dollar's use in international securities issuance, its use as the primary settlement currency for international trades and the fact that companies use dollars as examples of its dominance. However, ""developments in the U.S. economy, by affecting the dollar exchange rate, can have large spillover effects to the rest of the world.""  ""While the world economy is being reordered, the U.S. dollar remains as important as when Bretton Woods collapsed,"" Carney continued.  Carney suggested a number of possible replacements to the dollar, including the Chinese renminbi, and most notably, a digital currency supported by an international coalition of central banks. He said:  ""It is an open question whether such a new Synthetic Hegemonic Currency (SHC) would be best provided by the public sector, perhaps through a network of central bank digital currencies.""  ""An SHC could dampen the domineering influence of the U.S. dollar on global trade,"" Carney said.  Technology can disrupt the current network effects that protect the dollar, he explained, noting that an increasing number of transactions occur online and use electronic payments rather than cash.  While he did not explicitly reference cryptocurrencies, he did note that ""the relatively high costs of domestic and cross border electronic payments are encouraging innovation, with new entrants applying new technologies to offer lower cost, more convenient retail payment services.""  Libra example  One example is Facebook's proposed Libra crypto project, he noted. The social media giant has proposed Libra as a payments infrastructure and stablecoin backed by a basket of national currencies.  To succeed, Libra needs to address regulatory issues, Carney said.  ""The Bank of England and other regulators have been clear that unlike in social media, for which standards and regulations are only now being developed after the technologies have been adopted by billions of users, the terms of engagement for any new systemic private payments system must be in force well in advance of any launch.""  While a digital currency might not yet be ready to replace the dollar as a global currency, ""the concept is intriguing,"" Carney said.  ""It is worth considering how an SHC in the IMFS could support better global outcomes, given the scale of the challenges of the current IMFS and the risks in transition to a new hegemonic reserve currency like the Renminbi,"" he said.  If this new SHC were to take on a greater share of global trade, ""shocks in the U.S. would have less potent spillovers,"" he suggested, adding:  ""By the same token, global trade would become more sensitive to changes in conditions in the countries of the other currencies in the basket backing the SHC.""

42382565,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sBIV,1566590448,Largest Korean Exchange to Review Listings and Drop Failing Coins,"Bithumb will start reviewing its cryptocurrency listings on a monthly basis, becoming the second South Korean exchange this month to update its listing policies.  The audits will determine whether the crypto exchange's listed coins and tokens are eligible for continued trading, according to a story by Yonhap New Agency. The reviews will be undertaken by the newly formed Listing Eligibility Deliberation Committee, starting from September.  Bithumb is the eighth largest exchange in the world by reported volume, according to CoinMarketCap, and is the largest South Korean exchange.  The Yonhap report says that failing coins will be put on notice and then delisted after two months if no improvement is seen. It also said that those not making a passing grade would only be denied exchange trading rights. The coins themselves could still be traded elsewhere.  A number of triggers have been established for possible delisting. These include low trading volume, low market capitalization, lack of support from developers, problems with the underlying technology, illegal activity and requests from governing bodies.  The exchange says that the committee assembled will include attorneys and other professionals and that the process will be fair and transparent.  ""We will strengthen the check on the technology development efforts and utility of cryptocurrency projects,"" Yonhap quoted an exchange representative as saying.  The move by Bithumb comes amid a general upping of standards at exchanges as the South Korean authorities continue to crack down on crypto in the country and as banks tighten anti-money laundering procedures relating to the exchanges.  Earlier this month, Coinone hired CertiK to conduct a security validation. It then published criteria for coins wishing to list on the exchange, the third largest in the country and number 80 in the world. While Coinone's move differs from Bithumb's, in that it checks coins on the way in rather than on a rolling basis, both initiatives could improve the security and credibility of the trading platforms.  Bithumb was acquired in late 2018 by investors from Singapore. In March 2019, it was reported that the exchange would be cutting staff by about 50 percent. It suffered a theft of $13 million worth of crypto that same month.

42382573,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sBTp,1566580511,Web3's Gavin Wood Launches Kusama Network to Test Polkadot Protocol,"Developers will soon be able to test applications on a live version of blockchain interoperability protocol Polkadot.  Kusama, an experimental and unaudited version of the $1.2 billion network, was launched on Friday at the tail-end of Berlin Blockchain Week.  As highlighted in a blog post by Polkadot creator Gavin Wood, it will be somewhere between one to four weeks before developers can begin tapping the full functionality of the network. Until at least 50 “well-backed” validators are operating on the network, transfers of KSM tokens between users will not be possible.  Wood explained in the post which actions are now live:  ""Functionality that will be enabled is limited to usage of the Staking, Sessions and Claims modules; specifically, bonding, nominating and issuing an intention to become a validator, setting up one’s session keys and claiming KSMs will be supported.""  Once fully functioning, the Kusama network is expected to act as the proving ground for some of the most bleeding-edge technology planned for the actual Polkadot network, which is tentatively expected for launch early next year.  Wood spent much of Berlin Blockchain Week explaining the goals of the project.  Already, one of the teams expected to build on Polkadot is planning to run its applications on Kusama in the coming weeks.  KILT Protocol  project lead Ingo Ruebe said:  “We want to be part of this ecosystem but we have the feeling that not everything from a conceptual point of view has been thought through to the end so there’s still questions.”  Running KILT’s “virtual structures” on Kusama will serve to answer many questions, Ruebe said, including the auctioning structure of Polkadot parachains.  Explaining Parathreads  Polkadot parachains are basically individual blockchains that rely on a central blockchain, called the relay chain for enhanced security and network interoperability.  “The auctioning mechanism means you have a fixed number of parachain slots and the relay chain can only process so many parachains per block,” Wood said in an interview with CoinDesk. “It’s like how bitcoin can only process so many transactions per block and ethereum so much gas per block.”  According to Wood, the upfront cost for developers to lease a parachain slot on the Polkadot relay chain “could be very expensive.”  “With parachains, it’s a long-term commitment. You deposit [DOTs] two years at a time. You have to deposit a fair amount of DOTs to get this lease. It’s a fairly heavy tax,” said Wood.  This is why the Kusama network will help test a new Polkadot innovation known as parathreads.  Parathreads, according to Wood, allow developers to deploy an application for a fixed fee and process one block on the network at a time. Calling it a “pay-as-you-go” model, Wood said many applications could benefit from this kind of flexibility.  “A lot of use-cases really don’t need to be processing every single block,” said Wood. “At busy times they may want to process every block but at off-peak times, they want to process every five, 10 or 100 blocks.”  It’s precisely this kind of functionality that teams like KILT Protocol are eager to test out on Kusama.  Said Ruebe:  “We’re completely uncertain about the price of a parachain and it's not possible to make a business decision of being a parachain [or a parathread] if we don't know.”  Gavin Wood (second from right) speaks at Web3 Summit 2019, photo by Christine Kim for CoinDesk",POSITIVE,DOT,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | DOT | ETH,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/08/23/web3s-gavin-wood-launches-kusama-network-to-test-polkadot-protocol,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c6231f41c295d0951a4810913501ff7b2c91a083-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a speech at the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT Third Interoperability Forum, on August 22, principal deputy commissioner Dr. Amy Abernethy, said the FDA is looking to modernize the way health care providers, drug manufacturers, and regulatory agencies communicate.  Without going into details, Abernethy said the agency plans to roll out uses of artificial intelligence, APIs and blockchain in this modernization effort. Improved interoperability – how the agency handles and shares information – may affect the reviewal process for new medicines.  “I want FDA to get our own technical house in order so that tech can 'snap in' – we can be agile and efficient. We need to be able to have common interfaces with industry so we can pass data between our organizations, have collaborative review, etc,” Abernethy said.  “Traceability back to source allows for the ability to crosscheck, workflow solutions,” she said. In that sense, the immutable ledger that blockchain provides may be used to guarantee data quality that comes from a number of sources.  Abernethy also alluded to a communication system where regulators are provided with real-time information and data. This speeds up the reviewal process, because FDA agents will be able to exchange messages contemporaneously with medical manufacturers.  Additionally, improved surveillance of medical products will assist in “determining when something should be recalled or a product label should be adjusted,” she said.  With improved data flows, Abernethy said medicine can become more targeted and patient-oriented.  Abernethy also serves as the acting chief information officer of FDA.

Irkutsk, Eastern Siberia, is famously cold in the winter, when subzero temperatures are the norm. So a few weeks ago, when Slobodenyuk took the stage at the Baikal Blockchain and Crypto Forum with one of Hotmine's little white boxes in tow, he opened with a joke about the warm August weather.  “I was told that in Irkutsk, the average temperature of the air is minus 2 degrees Celsius, so I brought a radiator with me,” he said.  Eventually, Slobodenyuk told the crowd, Hotmine aspires to sell up to 200,000 of its devices to Irkutsk residents. But the Ukraine-based company's ultimate ambitions are even greater.  ""Our goal is to reach the point where 80 percent of all mining is done with the smart use of the hot air it's producing, at the same time protecting the bitcoin network,"" Slobodenyuk told CoinDesk, adding:  ""We believe mining should become decentralized again, with a full node in every home.""  It's a lofty goal, given that the four largest mining pools controlabout 60 percent of the total hashrate, or processing power devoted to securing the bitcoin network, according to BTC.com. But like bitcoin itself, Hotmine will seek to employ economic incentives to achieve its decentralist ideals.  According to Slobodenyuk, each Hotmine miner performs calculations at a rate of 8 tera hashes per second (th/s). With the current price of bitcoin, he said, 1 th/s earns about $7.20 a month, so a single heater can make about $55 for its owner while radiating heat for up to 10 square meters.  While the concept itself isn't new — last year, a French company called Qarnot announced a CPU-based mining heater that earns ether, for example – Hotmine is focusing on a region where it's likelier to resonate.  At the current prices for electricity in Irkutsk of 1-2 cents per kilowatt-hour, one heater needs less than $10 worth of power per month, so effectively the heat would be free, plus a modest income in bitcoin, Slobodenyuk said.  Even the coming halving, or periodic reduction in the amount of new bitcoin awarded to miners, won't hurt this model, he claimed.  Getting real  Hotmine started in 2013 – a lifetime ago in crypto time – with an experiment in a village near Kiev, Slobodenuyk said: it provided a bunch of homes with prototype mining boilers. People got free heat without even thinking about bitcoin, as all the work with crypto had been done for them.  After two years, the chips inside the boilers got old and mining stopped being profitable. When presented with the opportunity to keep the boilers but pay a little for electricity, people opted to switch back to wood stoves. Flashy new tech wasn't compelling if it didn't save them money.  Now, Hotmine is looking for partners to manufacture the electronics and metal boxes for its money-making heater. So far, it has offers from three potential partners in Russia.  A pilot batch of 60 heaters is scheduled for release as soon as November to test demand, the company announced. Approximate price tag: $1,050. By the end of the year, Hotmine aims to sell 100 to 200 heaters.  Asked if he believes people would readily learn how to deal with bitcoin wallets and exchanges to spend their radiators' earnings, Slobodenyuk said that at first, they won't have to.  Hotmine can partner with crypto service providers, and all consumers would have to do is give a bank account number before harvesting their income converted to fiat.  Sooner or later people might want to go further down the rabbit hole and figure out bitcoin for themselves, Hotmine hopes.  Warming to bitcoin  Another believer that bitcoin-powered heating is ready for wide adoption, at least in places like Eastern Siberia, is Irkutsk resident Ilya Frolov.  His startup, Imagine8, makes heating systems in which miners manufactured by market leader Bitmain are immersed in mineral oil, which distributes their heat to the floor. To showcase the tech, Imagine8 plans to build and rent out guest homes that use it.  Frolov, who has been working on such systems since 2016, said he and a school friend brought on some two dozen people to use the mining heaters in their homes in the Irkutsk suburbs.  Initially, Frolov would ask homeowners to heat their homes with the system and send him their electricity bills. Some were fine with this option, but more people caught the bitcoin bug as they learned how it works, Frolov said:  “First, they were like, ‘I heard about bitcoin, that’s a pyramid [scheme], but I want free heating.’ Then, we worked with them, gradually converted them to our religion. And in the end, they were like, ‘Ok, I figured that out, I'm going to mine bitcoin myself.”  According to him, such customers paid for hardware and installation, then learned to handle wallets and exchange accounts and now are taking care of their bitcoin themselves.  Other companies use the same technology now, and some people would buy miners and oil reservoirs and construct the system themselves after watching videos posted by Frolov and his competitors, he said.  An average house as big as 100 square meters takes about 10 kilowatts to heat via an electric boiler, a popular option in Irkutsk. Electricity bills in the Irkutsk winters might cost a homeowner several hundred dollars a month. Instead, six or eight specializing mining chips, known as ASICs can heat a home like that and earn owners some bitcoin.  And the environment benefits, Frolov argued, when machines do double duty, ""instead of having the heat from ASICs wasted in the air and people heating their houses with coal.”  Oles Slobodenyuk image by Anna Baydakova for CoinDesk; Siberian Ice cave via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | COMMODITY | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/08/23/bitcoin-miners-are-heating-homes-free-of-charge-in-frigid-siberia,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0bdad6905fe67475bce4e95ef9127dbb537d3aa3-2560x1793.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382576,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sBbN,1566561038,Craig Wright Again Claims Authorship of Bitcoin White Paper,"Craig Wright, the Australian entrepreneur who controversially says he's bitcoin's anonymous inventor Satoshi Nakamoto, has made another attempt to cement that claim in the public domain.  On Thursday, Wright posted the bitcoin white paper on the scientific journal hosting site, SSRN, citing himself as the author on Aug. 21, 2008.  The SSRN (formerly the Social Science Research Network), is a repository and international journal for the sharing of scholarly research. The service is owned by major publishing house Elsevier, and allows paper authors (or those claiming to be) to upload pdfs of their work.  The hosting site does not peer-review papers that are uploaded, according to its website. Uploads are reviewed by SSRN staff ""to ensure that the paper is a part of the scholarly discourse in its subject area."" It also asks authors to self-certify that the information submitted is correct.  Wright's posting of the bitcoin white paper, the authorship of which has yet to be conclusively proven, comes after he filed registrations with the U.S. Copyright Office to support his claim of authorship over the original bitcoin code and white paper in May.  Soon after the news caused uproar in the bitcoin community, the Copyright Office released a statement to dispel the notion that it had officially “recognized” anyone as the inventor of bitcoin.  “As a general rule, when the Copyright Office receives an application for registration, the claimant certifies as to the truth of the statements made in the submitted materials. The Copyright Office does not investigate the truth of any statement made,” the office said at the time.  Similarly, Wright's posting of Satoshi's white paper on the SSRN is unlikely to give his claim to have invented bitcoin any more validity, but seems to be an attempt to populate the web with authoritative-looking instances of his claim.  Some commentators have further claimed that the metadata of the paper posted by Wright has been altered to display a different date of creation.

42403195,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfCGh,1566558020,Bitcoin Price Looks Bearish Despite Bounce to $10.2K,"View  Bitcoin's recovery from $9,755 to $10,255 seen in the last 24 hours lacks volume support and could be short-lived.  Supporting the case for a drop back to $9,755 are the rising-wedge breakdown on the hourly chart and a bearish candlestick pattern on the 3-day chart.  Wednesday's rising-wedge breakdown on the 4-hour chart is still valid and favors a drop to $9,467 (Aug. 15 low).  Bearish pressures would weaken if prices print a UTC close above the bearish lower high of $10,956. A weekly close (Sunday, UTC) above $12,000 is needed for bullish revival.      The path of least resistance for bitcoin (BTC) remains to the downside, despite a price bounce to $10,200 seen in the last 24 hours.  The top cryptocurrency by the market value found bids below the widely-followed 100-day moving average support at $9,900 on Wednesday and rebounded to a high of $10,255 earlier today.  Investors may feel tempted to call a bullish move, as a similar recovery from sub-100-day MA level seen on Aug. 15 was followed by a $1,000 rally to highs above $10,900 by Aug. 20.  The latest price recovery, however, looks unsustainable due to lack of volume support, as seen in the chart below.  Low-volume bounce  In the above chart, the green bars represent buying volumes and the red bars represent selling volumes.  The green bars seen in the last 24 hours are smaller compared to the red bars observed during the price drop $10,600 to $9,755.  Put simply, the buying pressure remained weak as prices rose from $9,755 to $10,255. A low-volume bounce is often short-lived.  Also, the cryptocurrency has dived out of a rising wedge – a bearish reversal pattern which indicates the corrective bounce from $9,755 has ended and the bears have regained control.  As per technical theory, the price seen at the beginning of a rising wedge formation becomes the minimum downside target once a breakdown is confirmed. So, a fall back to $9,755 could be on the cards.  A rally to $10,550-$10,600 could be seen if prices break above the wedge's high of $10,255 with decent volumes. The outlook, however, will remain bearish as long as prices are held below $10,956.  Daily and 4-hour charts  BTC's bounce from the 100-day MA support seen on Aug. 15 ended up charting a bearish lower high (shallow bounce) at $10,956 on Aug. 30 (above right).  So, $10,956 is the level to beat for the bulls in the short-term.  The case for a drop to $9,467 put forward by the rising wedge breakdown on the 4-hour chart (above right) earlier this week will remain valid as long as prices are held below $10,807 – the high of the candle confirming the breakdown.  3-day chart  BTC created a bearish outside bar candlestick pattern in the three days to Aug. 20. A bearish outside bar appears when a specific period's price action engulfs the preceding period's high and low.  That candlestick pattern marks a continuation of the selloff from the high of $12,325 reached in the first week of August.  All-in-all, the probability of BTC falling to the recent low of $9,467 in the short-term seems high. The outlook as per the three-day chart would turn bullish if and when prices find acceptance above the trendline connecting June and July highs.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $10,140 on Bitstamp, representing a 1.5 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42403194,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfCFi,1566556256,Litecoin's Mining Power Has Fallen 28% Since Its Halving,"Many litecoin (LTC) miners working to secure the blockchain and compete for block rewards have been unplugging their machinery following the cryptocurrency's recent ""halving"" event, network data shows.  Litecoin's mining difficulty – a coded-in measure of how hard it is to solve the mathematical puzzles used to write blocks on the network – has dropped from 15.93 million on Aug. 4, one day before the halving, to 11.40 million on Aug. 22, based on data from mining pool BTC.com. The hashing power on the network has also fallen by 28 percent.  Litecoin's mining difficulty is designed to automatically adjust every 2,016 blocks, approximately every 4 days, to ensure the block-producing interval remains about 2.5 minutes based on the average hashing power in the current cycle.  The 28 percent difficulty drop means the current level is the lowest since April 29. BTC.com's data estimates that difficulty will continue to decline by another four percent at the next adjustment date, which is due in three days.  The 4-day average hashing power on the litecoin network has also declined from 456 terahash per second (TH/s) recorded on Aug. 4 to 326 TH/s on Aug. 22 at 23:54 UTC, when the latest difficulty adjustment occurred – a 28 percent drop.  Data for the three-day hash rate distribution indicates that currently miners connected to the mining pool Poolin account for 23 percent of the network's total computing power, followed by those connected to f2pool and Bitmain's Antpool.  The decline of mining interest is perhaps not surprising as the halving event on Aug. 5 reduced litecoin's block rewards from 25 LTC to 12.5 LTC, leaving existing mining equipment with a significantly decreased profitability.  F2pool's data shows the most profitable miners on the litecoin network, made by InnoSilicon and FusionSilicon, now have a profitability of between 10 to 20 percent, as LTC's price has dropped from $93 before the halving to around $74 at press time.  Assuming the electricity needed to power the miners costs $0.04 per kWh, these models are estimated to bring home a daily profit between $0.20 and $0.50. At the current price of LTC, older mining equipment like Bitmain's AntMiner L3 and L3+ would be making negligible profit at just over $0.01 a day, f2pool's index shows.  Litecoin is the fifth largest cryptocurrency by market cap currently.

42403191,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfCDk,1566553358,Tensions Rising at Facebook Libra as Backers Consider Quitting: Report,"Several backers of Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency project are said to be considering backing out due to growing pressure from regulators.  According to a report from the Financial Times, three of the firms (which were not named) expressed concerns over being seen to be linked to the project after watchdogs around the world raised concerns over its potential threat to financial stability.  The EU was recently reported to have even moved to investigate the Libra Association over potential antitrust issues. Over in the U.S., lawmakers have called for Libra to be halted until regulatory issues have been addressed.  As a result, two of the firms are considering pulling out of the Libra project, the FT said.  Since its debut in mid-June, Libra is said to have been joined by 28 member firms who have paid up to $10 million to be part of the project. These include major firms such as Visa, Mastercard, Paypal and Uber. Visa's CEO revealed last month that the firms had signed ""nonbinding letter of intent to join Libra,"" and were not yet fully committed to the enterprise.  “It's going to be difficult for partners who want to be seen as in [regulatory] compliance"" to be publicly supporting Libra, one of the companies told the FT. A Libra backer also said that Facebook should have addressed the regulatory issues before announcing the project to lessen the ""pushback.""  The frustrations appear to be going both ways, with the sources saying that Facebook itself is unhappy that the Libra Association members aren't voicing support for the project.  “Facebook is tired of being the only people putting their neck out,” said one of the members.  Facebook and the Libra Association would not comment when contacted by the FT.
