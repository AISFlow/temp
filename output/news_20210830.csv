The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) outlined design features, use cases and guidelines in a document it shared with the country’s banks as it prepares a pilot for an October launch, according to the report published on Sunday.  The e-naira will be a non-interest-bearing CBDC, and customers won’t be charged for user-to-merchant transactions and peer-to-peer wallet transactions.  A presentation circulating via Twitter and WhatsApp, and bearing the insignia of the CBN, said that the CBDC will have the same purchasing power as the naira.  The presentation also indicates that the e-naira project, which is dubbed “Project Giant,” is in phase three of four phases leading up to the October pilot.  Phase three calls for introducing banks to the project, and phase four focuses on educating customers about the digital currency.  E-naira project participants will be involved in five ways, according to Nairametrics, with the CBN handling the issuance and distribution of the currency, while licensed financial institutions will be able to “request currency or issue stablecoins”  The report also notes that the currency will have to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements laid out by the CBN.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/08/30/nigeria-central-bank-issues-cbdc-guidelines-to-commercial-banks-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/94b3fd37f3e45391b4985cc3bb99bb1abc0d1366-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396973,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT8FW6,1630356043,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Consolidates as Altcoin Season Heats Up,"Bitcoin BTC traded sideways on Monday and is holding support above the 200-day moving average of about $46,000. The cryptocurrency was changing hands at around $48,000 at press time and is roughly flat over the past 24 hours. Analysts expect bitcoin to remain rangebound heading into the end of the month as investors show a strong preference for altcoins.  “BTC price continues to hover above its 200-day moving average with the bulls still in play,” Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad, chief product officer at crypto trading platform Bitpanda, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  Improving blockchain data is one reason why bulls remain active above support levels.  “Fundamental factors have improved in recent weeks as the hash rate has now recovered to early June’s levels, indicating that miners are coming back online after China shut down its activities,” Enzersdorfer-Konrad wrote.  Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC) $48,591 -0.6%  Ether (ETH) $3,339 +3.9%  S&P 500: +0.4%  Gold: -0.4%  10-year Treasury yield: 1.278%, down 0.034 percentage point  Enzersdorfer-Konrad also pointed to the recent surge in altcoins as bitcoin consolidates, which could reflect an appetite for greater risk among investors.  The “alt-season index,” which tracks the relative performance across cryptocurrencies over the past 30 days, shows a clear skew toward altcoins. On a yearly basis, however, altcoin performance still has some room to catch up to bitcoin, as shown in the chart below.  Bitcoin accumulation demand  Blockchain data shows large accumulation demand for bitcoin, which underpinned the recent relief rally.  The “bitcoin price is currently sitting at the top end of a strong on-chain support zone,” Glassnode tweeted on Monday.  The chart below shows bitcoin’s realized price distribution. Each bar represents the number of existing bitcoin that last moved within the specified price bucket. The green-shaded region shows strong accumulation support in the $31,000 to $40,000 price range.  More than 1.6 million BTC now have a cost basis within the $45,000 to $50,000 range, which has also experienced accumulation, according to Glassnode data.  Investors add to altcoin funds  Bitcoin investment products recorded their eighth consecutive week of outflows, totaling $3.8 million, but altcoin funds continued to attract fresh capital, a report Monday showed.  Overall, crypto funds netted inflows totaling $24 million during the week ended Aug. 27, down about $3 million from the prior week, according to the report by digital asset investment manager CoinShares.  Funds focused on the cardano altcoin saw inflows totaling $10.1 million over the past week as the price of cardano has doubled over the past month.  Dogecoin volume drops  Dogecoin’s DOGE trading volume on the Coinbase exchange has been lackluster in August as buyers appear to be taking a breather. The cryptocurrency is up about 30% over the past month, compared with a 16% gain for bitcoin over the same period. Earlier this month, DOGE stalled near the $0.35 resistance level as the broader crypto market experienced a pullback.  Lower trading volume in DOGE has been positively correlated with fewer purchases than sells on the Coinbase exchange over the past few weeks.  “Buy ratios for altcoins remain elevated overall,” Coinbase wrote in a newsletter to institutional clients on Friday. In “ICP (light gray) we saw the buy ratio oscillating between 18%-75% also reflecting more aggressive risk taking first and profit taking around August 20th.”  Altcoin roundup:  SOL Hits Record High: Programmable blockchain Solana’s SOL token crossed the $100 mark on Monday, drawing a three-figure price for the first time, CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reports. The cryptocurrency ranked eighth largest by market cap, ahead of polkadot and stablecoin USDC, and is trading just short of the record $101 registered during Asian trading hours, CoinGecko data show. SOL has more than doubled in the past two weeks, largely on the back of the boom in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  Avalanche Added to DeFi Exchange Aggregator OpenOcean: Avalanche is the latest base layer to be added to DeFi aggregator OpenOcean, CoinDesk’s Jamie Crawley reports. OpenOcean connects decentralized and centralized exchanges on its supported networks, automatically seeking the best trades. The site has processed more than 970,000 transactions since its launch in last September and claims to have 270,000 active unique addresses, a rough proxy of users in the pseudonymous world of DeFi. Avalanche and its native AVAX token have surged in recent weeks as DeFi users look to get a slice of $180 million in incentives on Benqi, SushiSwap and other decentralized lending platforms.  DeFi Protocol Cream Finance Hacked (Again): Cream Finance, a DeFi lending protocol, suffered its second flash loan attack this year, with the perpetrators draining more than $25 million, CoinDesk’s Eliza Gkritsi reports. The attack was first reported by PeckShield in a tweet early on Monday. The blockchain security firm pointed to Ethereum records showing at least $6 million were drained at 5:44 UTC.

42421766,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpO29,1630352474,Regulating Stablecoins for What They Are,"Stablecoins remind me of Superman. As our superhero flies in to save the day yet again, the cry goes up: “Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it’s Superman!” Similarly, when people used to the conventional financial system voice their fears about stablecoins, their arguments center on what stablecoins are, not on what they do. “Is it a bank? Is it a money market fund?” No, it’s a stablecoin!  Trying to regulate stablecoins on the basis of what they superficially resemble is like telling Superman to obey air traffic control. If Superman actually obeys air traffic control, he can’t do his job. Similarly, a stablecoin regulated like a bank or a money market fund (MMF) would not be able to do its job. And, as I shall explain, stablecoins have an immensely important job to do, not only in the crypto ecosystem but potentially also in the conventional financial world.  So rather than trying to work out what stablecoins are, let’s focus on what they do. How do people actually use them, and for what purposes? What is their role in the crypto ecosystem? What potential role might they play in the mainstream financial system?  These questions really arise from one of the most fascinating aspects of cryptocurrency. We don’t understand stablecoins because we haven’t understood how crypto has redefined – indeed is still redefining – the nature of money.  Money has three functions: store of value, medium of exchange, unit of account (numeraire). The problem is that combining all three is notoriously difficult.  Read More: What Is a Stablecoin?  An asset that is a good store of value tends to be a poor medium of exchange: Good long-term stores of value are typically scarce and illiquid, whereas good media of exchange need to be plentiful and highly liquid.  A medium of exchange needs to hold its value over the short run, so extreme volatility is death for a medium of exchange. But extreme volatility in a store of value is not a major problem as long as it appreciates over the long term.  And a unit of account must be generally understood, widely accepted and not subject to arbitrary redefinition, which might not be the case for either a store of value or a medium of exchange.  Trying to regulate all stablecoins like banks or MMFs runs the risk that they will be unable to do their primary job of providing liquidity to the crypto ecosystem.  The crypto community has tried hard to convince the world that bitcoin, and to a lesser extent other cryptocurrencies, can fulfill all three functions better than any past or present currency or asset. But the way things are developing suggests that this battle has been lost. Bitcoin has become a major asset class and is showing signs of holding value over the long term. But although bitcoin maximalists like to insist that one bitcoin equals one bitcoin, the reality is that people tend to measure the value of BTC, and indeed all cryptocurrencies, in U.S. dollars. And despite recent attempts to improve bitcoin’s liquidity (through subdivision and layer 2 solutions), its high price and extreme volatility make it extremely risky as a medium of exchange.  So the U.S. dollar has become the numeraire of the crypto ecosystem, and bitcoin its premier reserve asset. But what is its principal settlement currency? It’s not the U.S. dollar. In the crypto ecosystem, dollars are far too scarce and illiquid to use as principal settlement currency. And it’s not bitcoin either, nor any other traded cryptocurrency. Right now, the principal settlement currency in the crypto ecosystem is tether.  Tether, or rather Tether’s U.S. dollar token USDT, is a pure medium of exchange. It is, in effect, the crypto equivalent of a fiat currency. Its value is maintained at approximately 1 USDT to 1 U.S. dollar by means of open market operations performed by its issuer through a network of partner exchanges, somewhat akin to the Fed’s broker-dealer network. At the time of writing, over 65 billion USDT have been issued, more than twice as many as the next largest dollar-denominated stablecoin, USDC.  So USDT is extremely liquid, but its nominal yield is zero and it pays no interest. It’s a zero-coupon perpetual U.S. dollar bond, if you like. And its quantity is both potentially unlimited and controlled by an opaque, unaccountable entity. Now, of what does this remind you?  Because USDT and USDC are pegged to the U.S. dollar, which is an inflationary currency, they have a negative real yield. So they are a terrible store of value. Absolutely no one holds these stablecoins as assets. To make money from stablecoins, you have to lend, trade or pledge them for something riskier. And that’s exactly what people do. USDT, and to a lesser extent other stablecoins, are cash collateral in crypto lending as well as settlement media in crypto trading.  It’s worth remembering that the distinction between lending and trading is a pretty fine one, especially if the assets you are pledging are rehypothecated (or reused for another financial purpose). Even though it is not much more than a decade since rehypothecation chains in the conventional financial system disastrously unravelled, crypto lending platforms routinely rehypothecate collateral.  Really, stablecoins are pure cash. They are denominated in U.S. dollars because that’s the crypto world’s unit of account, but that doesn’t mean people necessarily want to cash them in for dollars. Indeed, they might not be able to: Exchanges can suspend trading in stablecoin/USD pairs if they run out of dollar liquidity, and some stablecoin issuers impose limits on redemptions.  But many of those using stablecoins to play on the crypto casinos don’t want U.S. dollars anyway. They just want a highly liquid medium of exchange. Stablecoins – especially USDT and USDC – meet that need.  So the crypto world has successfully resolved the conflicted nature of money by adopting the U.S. dollar as numeraire, bitcoin (denominated in USD) as premier reserve asset and stablecoins as settlement currencies. It’s not at all what the founder or founders of Bitcoin intended, but finance has always been evolutionary and emergent. How things are used defines what they become.  Read More: State of Crypto: Stablecoin Rules Are Coming  And this also means the debates about whether stablecoins are more like banks or money market funds entirely miss the point. Stablecoins aren’t like either. People don’t place their dollars with Tether to keep them safe, nor to earn interest. They buy tokens with the intention of trading, lending or pledging them to earn money. The dollars they pay for those tokens are more akin to the tax payments that maintain the value of fiat currencies than to deposits in a bank or MMF.  Trying to regulate all stablecoins like banks or MMFs runs the risk that they will be unable to do their primary job of providing liquidity to the crypto ecosystem. I’m not sure this would benefit anyone.  Whether a stablecoin needs dollar reserves depends not on its role in the crypto ecosystem, but its actual or potential use in the conventional payments system. A stablecoin used only within the crypto ecosystem wouldn’t need 100% dollar reserves. It would only need sufficient dollar liquidity to maintain its peg – and if exchanges are compliant and redemptions restricted, that might not be very much. And if some stablecoins failed to maintain their pegs, would it really matter, if other stablecoins could take their place? Competing currencies in a free-market system. What’s not to like?  However, stablecoins have a second potential use that is extremely powerful but carries the seeds of disaster if not properly regulated. Stablecoins could replace conventional rails for international payments, potentially making them faster, cheaper and available 24/7. But stablecoins used for this purpose would need to be fully exchangeable for U.S. dollars or other fiat currencies on demand 24/7, and would therefore either need 100% dollar reserves or access to central bank liquidity.  Rather than wasting time and energy trying to regulate crypto-only stablecoins as if they are banks or MMFs, therefore, regulators should concentrate on ensuring that stablecoins that are, or show signs of becoming, payment media within the conventional financial system have 100% reserves and/or are licensed banks. After all, Superman also has a conventional life – and in that life, he plays by conventional rules.",NEUTRAL,BTC | USDT,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | USDT,Frances Coppola,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/08/30/regulating-stablecoins-for-what-they-are,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/54b67704024f5248a22e487360e360c0a27cb3bf-1400x962.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a tweet today, pseudonymous NFT collector Vincent Van Dough announced the fund, saying that in addition to investing in art and collectibles, the fund would launch an “NFT education portal,” promote emerging artists and launch a physical NFT gallery space in a “major city” before the end of the year.  Leading up to the announcement, Three Arrows’ NFT wallets had been closely watched by NFT aficionados as the investment firm hoovered assets from historic and popular NFT collections such as CryptoPunks and Ringers.

Research, investment and consulting firm Delphi Digital announced the launch of InfiNFT in May in collaboration with pseudonymous collector Gmoney. In 2020, Delphi also took a position in NFTs via the purchase of rare “mystic” Axie Infinity NFTs.  Additionally, shortly after the launching of Starry Night, data from on-chain analytics firm Nansen showed an address associated with Sam Bankman-Fried’s Alameda Research trading firm acquired a trio of Art Blocks Curated NFTs, including a Ringer, a Fidenza and a Subscape for a combined 614 ETH, or over $2 million.

42421053,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXBLR7,1630352220,Art in the Age of Digital Scarcity: Why NFTs Enchant Us,"Last Monday, when Visa announced it had bought a CryptoPunk non-fungible token (NFT) collectible to add to its financial history collection, I noted that these weird little 8-bit crypto tokens were valued for the same reasons people buy luxury status symbols like jewelry or sports cars.  But really, that amounts to “they’re valuable because they’re valued,” barely scratching the surface of the deeper why. When you’re talking about bitcoin that’s enough, because it’s money – “it’s valuable because we agree it is” is inherent to the design.  If you’re talking about a collectible or status symbol, though, you’ll usually find some nominal root of value: A diamond or a painting is beautiful, a Ferrari goes fast and a $300,000 Charizard could still theoretically win you a game of Pokemon. These are things of inherent value whose rarity pumps them into the stratosphere.  So here’s a harder question: Once you’ve subtracted the status value of an NFT, what’s left?  The allure of NFTs, as much as it might make no sense to our rational brains, is clearly intense. You can look at the exploding transaction volumes on platforms like OpenSea, or the success of collectibles like NBA Topshot or, of course, CryptoPunks, and the numbers speak for themselves.  But as with most things in crypto, you can’t really understand what’s going on until you dive in and try it out. So I loaded a bit of fresh ETH into MetaMask and went shopping on OpenSea, hoping to find a poor man’s CryptoPunk so I no longer had to be a sad pleb with a disgusting Twitter avatar featuring my frail and wretched human body.  The best comparison I can make is that NFT shopping is like crate diving for vinyl records, of which I own far too many. When I’m in a record shop (and my condolences to anyone who hasn’t had this experience), I spend most of my time thinking of reasons not to buy one or another record, because they all have some degree of appeal and in a truly perfect world I’d own all of them. NFTs, likewise, trigger a kind of obsession distinct from a day trader’s itchy urge to ape into a trendy offering.  So what is that extra something that comes from buying an NFT – and how does it play into demand and pricing for digital collectibles? To try and answer that key question, I got some help from NFT investors, industry leaders – and the surprisingly relevant insights of a German philosopher who has been dead for nearly a century.  Here’s the quick version of the theory I wound up with: In the physical world, an object’s authenticity is the root of the status it confers on the owner. Authenticity is, largely, another word for an object’s history. That history, whether individually or in connection with a tradition or brand or artist, is the source of the ineffable allure that makes collecting so satisfying for many.  NFTs are valuable in themselves and represent a totally novel category because they give digital objects a claim on the sense of presence, history, and authenticity previously reserved for physical objects. And the deeper and more interesting the history, all things being equal, the deeper that aura of authenticity is, the greater status conferred on the owner – and the more they’re willing to pay for it.  However, all of this depends on a shift in perception, one happening right now and based in growing appreciation of blockchain technology. It requires that a critical mass of people learn to see digital objects as real.  A status game  To understand deep value, a good place to start is how a thing is actually used. So how are people actually using NFTs today?  The most visible use among influential collectors is pretty simple: They’re Twitter avatars.  NFTs come in a few different flavors, and some of the headline-grabbing sales have been for single pieces of art. There’s also significant demand for pure collectibles like NBA Top Shot, and a growing market for game assets like cards or virtual “land.”  But the critical mass of real frenzy is for a particular genre of cartoonish headshots. Jay-Z made news recently when he made a CryptoPunk his Twitter avatar, which was soon followed by NFL player Odell Beckham Jr. Spend about five seconds on crypto Twitter and you’ll see all manner of punks, apes, penguins and herrings where you might expect to see a human face.  In theory, of course, you could just use a screenshot of any NFT and put it in your Twitter profile. But that would be a major faux pas.  “It’s almost like, why would you do that?” asks Henry Love, a managing partner at Fundamental Labs, an investment fund focused on NFTs and NFT infrastructure. It’s “implicit,” he says, that posting an NFT as an avatar implies that you own it, even without any technological guardrails to enforce the norm.  “Twitter is a place where you want to gain credibility,” says Love. “That’s really the game of Twitter. So if you have a fake NFT or a CryptoPunk that you don’t own [as an avatar], that’s detrimental to your credibility in the long run.”  This is an early, informal version of what could become a technological element of online spaces like Twitter. A platform coded to only display only NFTs in a user’s own Ethereum address, for instance, would make their authenticity much clearer for a wider community.  So that’s, you might say, layer 1 of the NFT value question. “Why does this image have any value at all? Because of its ‘flex’ utility,” as NFT leader gmoney.eth wrote in a recent thread. The more valuable or rare an NFT, the more status it conveys.  But that still doesn’t quite answer the question: Really, why do we care about these things?  Walter Benjamin and the threat of the photograph  The philosopher Walter Benjamin was born in 1892, just in time for his life to coincide with a major technological revolution in art.  Though the printing press and lithograph had already been around for a while, it was in the late 19th and early 20th century that photographic reproduction and cinema became widespread. Before about 1850, it was impossible to view more than a rough approximation of the Mona Lisa without standing in front of it. By the time Benjamin was in his prime, you could get a Mona Lisa postcard for a penny, then go around the corner to watch a silent film depicting Da Vinci painting it.  Benjamin was fascinated and bothered by these changes. He wondered, among other things, whether these photographic reproductions made the original less attractive or interesting. He worried that the original would lose its unique, ineffable value thanks to the wide availability of copies: “That which withers in the age of mechanical reproduction is the aura of the work of art,” he wrote in the 1935 essay “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,” which remains the most influential thing ever written about the human relationship to art in a technological age.  A century later, the power of the “original” seems to have endured: a staggering 10 million people traveled all the way to the Louvre in 2018 to see the Mona Lisa in person, even though they could access a high-definition copy, for free, with a single click.  What, Benjamin asked, gives an original object this immense magnetic pull? Certainly, some small portion of the importance of an original painting has to do with the subtleties of light and texture on the paint itself, which can’t be reproduced virtually now, and probably never will be with sufficient nuance to really replace a physical object. But that nuance, frankly, is beyond the grasp of most museum-goers, and Benjamin didn’t think it was what really mattered.  The aura of an authentic NFT  What, then, is the “aura” of an original piece of art?  “Even the most perfect reproduction of a work of art,” Benjamin wrote, “is lacking in one element: Its presence in time and space, its unique existence at the place where it happens to be. This unique existence of the work of art determined the history to which it was subject throughout the time of its existence. This includes the changes it may have suffered in physical condition over the years as well as the various changes in its ownership.”  This point is vital to understanding the appeal of NFTs. Attaching a piece of digital media to a blockchain that ensures its continuity and tracks its ownership. These, Benjamin argued, are what support the “aura” of an original artwork, and make it more appealing, and thus more valuable, than a copy. What matters to the awesome power of some works of art, he insists, is the history of their passage through space and time.  This aura is ultimately what separates an NFT on Ethereum from a JPEG on your hard drive – but in a radically different way than the aura of a painting. NFTs, after all, aren’t painstakingly hand-painted onto a canvas, but they aren’t copies of anything, either.  The art, of course, exists on an artist’s computer and a server somewhere, and is “reproduced” by the mechanism of a computer screen, not so different from Benjamin’s film screens. But the actual thingness of an NFT (its ontological status, to use fancy words) rests not on an image, but on the ledger entry that secures its continuous existence in time and its location within the geography of cyberspace. The blockchain is what gives digital objects an aura, by giving them both history and presence.  But this sense of history and presence don’t operate according to familiar real-world logic. For the aura of an NFT to hold sway over your little monkey brain, you must already have some awareness of the technology that guarantees its uniqueness. Without some insight into the entire blockchain ecosystem and its technology stack, an NFT really does just look like a JPEG to you.  This sounds weird and untenable, but it’s not novel: Similar transitions in how we “see the world” have accompanied every major shift in media technology. A well-known popular legend has it that screenings of an early short film of a train entering a station caused audiences to panic and stampede, because they didn’t yet know the difference between the two-dimensional and three-dimensional worlds.  It’s not clear that this story is actually true, but it epitomizes a broader process of “learning to see” film in its particular relation to reality. And a similar change is happening right now in the realm of the digital.  “To anyone under 40, things that are digital, it’s not a knee-jerk reaction that they’re not real,” says William Quigley. Quigley is a former director of legendary tech incubator IdeaLab; he built marketplaces for video game items before founding WAX, a blockchain for collectible NFTs.  He had a firm grasp on how much some people valued digital objects, well before NFTs were invented. Now, he’s seeing the security of NFT technology supercharge that appeal, and he predicts a future where their aura of authenticity gains more and more power over buyers.  “If you’re in the art business, you better look at the 35 or other set, because when they think about buying art, they’re thinking digital, not some canvas they have to figure out where to hang. I wonder if physical art is just less desired in the next 30-40 years.”  Personally, I think Quigley is overstating the case a bit, in part because NFTs will almost inevitably have less interesting histories than a physical painting. Blockchain systems carry relatively tiny amounts of information, so a “reality premium” will likely persist – not too differently from the way reproductions have actually made more people want to see the original Mona Lisa in person.  But we can clearly see the power of history already in action, with the high and growing values attached to CryptoPunks. If Jay-Z ever decides to sell his Punk, you can bet your bottom dollar that his having owned it will add even more to its resale value, well into the future. Conversely, bootleg NFTs that use art or IP not owned by the creators may have a harder time retaining long-term value, since they’re not “authentic” – though for entirely non-technological reasons.  Other standards will certainly emerge around what’s considered legitimate or desirable. The “aura” of a painting, after all, relied on social consensus as much as physical reality, and the consensus around NFTs will form the same way. But ultimately they’ll all rely on one thing: the sense of continuity and history that we can now, for the first time, experience in the digital realm.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,David Z.

Bitcoin from the wallets Liquid identified as belonging to the hackers has been on the move over the past two weeks, public blockchain data shows. For example, on Aug. 29, 100 BTC (worth over $4.8 million) from one hacker-linked address was split up and sent to two separate addresses, then further broken into smaller pieces and distributed to yet more addresses.  At least some of that bitcoin was then sent to addresses believed to be generated by a Wasabi wallet, according to Crystal Blockchain data.  This was one of many similar transactions that the hackers made using Wasabi, presumably to disconnect the stolen funds from their criminal history, according to Crystal. This would be a necessary step to spend such funds or sell them for fiat money, because centralized exchanges tend to freeze funds that are known to come from hacks, exploits and scams.  Over 437 BTC (worth over $20 million) associated with the Liquid hackers have been laundered using Wasabi’s CoinJoin feature, and the process is still ongoing, according to Crystal.  Earlier this month, CoinDesk tracked other funds funneled out of Liquid, finding that ether and ERC20 tokens were sent to Ethereum-based online mixer Tornado.cash and decentralized exchanges (DEXs).  Wasabi is a privacy-focused desktop wallet that allows users to make their bitcoin less traceable on the public ledger by arranging so-called CoinJoin transactions. Multiple users can commingle their bitcoin in joint transactions and get it back disconnected from the previous history of payments. It also routes transactions over the Tor network which further helps to conceal the user’s IP address.  Although Wasabi is a non-custodial wallet that doesn’t store users’ funds, it generates addresses for CoinJoin transactions that blockchain analytics tools have learned to identify. Crypto sleuthing firm Elliptic did this last year, following bitcoin coming from the infamous Twitter hack to addresses associated with Wasabi.  According to Kyrylo Chykhradze, product director for Crystal Blockchain, identification of such addresses is more challenging than attributing addresses to custodial crypto services, so Crystal makes “a lot of double-checks before the final labeling” of the addresses in their analytics system.  Wasabi did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Swapped and tumbled  According to Crystal Blockchain, wallets associated with the Liquid hackers received some 1,168 BTC in total, most of which they got by swapping other cryptocurrencies for bitcoin on several exchanges.  CoinDesk previously reported that the hackers sent stolen XRP tokens to three exchanges – Binance, Huobi and Poloniex – where they managed to exchange them for bitcoin on the first day after the hack. That bitcoin stash was later partially laundered via Wasabi’s CoinJoin addresses, according to Crystal.  ERC20 tokens, which run on the Ethereum blockchain, had been sent to decentralized exchanges (DEXs), swapped for ether and then sent to Tornado.cash, an online mixer for ether. Some tokens were also swapped for bitcoin on the decentralized exchange Ren, resulting in additional 394 BTC in the hackers’ stash, Chykhradze said.  “For almost two weeks hackers have been using different methods to cover their tracks – substantial amounts of XRP, ETH and ERC20 tokens were either converted into BTC or mixed through the Tornado tumbler service,” Chykhradze said.  Plus, several dozen BTC were put on multiple unidentified wallets and left there for now.  Liquid, a Japanese cryptocurrency exchange, was hacked on Aug. 18. About $97 million worth of multiple cryptocurrencies were siphoned out. The exchange immediately started publishing updates on the hack and the addresses to which the hackers withdrew money.  Several exchanges worked with Liquid to label and block the addresses related to the hackers, they previously told CoinDesk. However, in many cases the hackers managed to get funds out faster than the exchanges reacted.  On Aug. 30, Liquid posted an update urging users to generate new deposit wallets.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH | XRP,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | XRP,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/08/30/money-trail-from-liquid-exchange-hack-points-to-wasabi-privacy-wallets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6dfc6ca3e5782422c243c50bc8d62e15eb0a12a8-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394054,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69buzwgN,1630345856,Bitpanda’s Success Is Thanks to Timing and Poker,"Paul Klanschek likes to play poker, for fun and profit. In college, the founder and CEO of Bitpanda started playing professional poker to finance his studies. Seven years later, he is at the reins of Austria’s first unicorn, a privately held company valued at more than $1 billion.  To Klanschek, playing poker and running a company go hand in hand.  “Poker is a pure math game. It’s looking at the data and figuring out the best move,” he said. “It is really important that you don’t go with too much of your own intuition or biases, but, instead, really look at cold, hard data.”  Bitpanda, a cryptocurrency investment platform based in Vienna, recently raised more than $170 million, giving it a valuation of $4.1 billion. This came just six months after a $52 million Series A funding round. The average time between rounds is usually 18 months.  “It’s nice to watch how we went from this weird niche product to everybody now talking about it and being the de facto service to go to if you buy crypto in Austria,” Klanschek said.  Klanschek heard about crypto for the first time in 2010 when he was researching how to transfer funds online. Back then, the use of bitcoin was still very small and only a few people knew about it. “The only thing you could buy with it were some alpaca socks,” he said.  To finance his studies and earn a master’s degree, Klanschek started playing professional poker online and became part of a community that was constantly looking for new technologies. That’s also how he met Bitpanda co-founder Eric Demuth, with whom he now has daily midnight business meetings.  “I was always a bit annoyed that nobody really provided an easy way to buy digital currencies,” Klanschek said, remembering how he kept telling friends and family to buy crypto but couldn’t tell them how or where to get it.  “I kind of got hooked on the idea that this could be something bigger than it was back then,” he said. So he got together with co-founders Demuth and Christian Trummer thinking that, if nobody else wants to offer that service, they should do it.  In fact, crypto and online poker have parallel histories, as the writer Morgen Peck has documented. The original Bitcoin code, published in 2008, has remnants of what appear to be a virtual poker game, raising the possibility that Satoshi Nakamoto was thinking about poker while creating the peer-to-peer network.  In case you think poker’s sometimes sleazy history means Bitpanda lives in the regulatory shadows, Klanschek makes strenuous efforts to avoid such perceptions and allay any fears.  “From the beginning on, we decided to really focus on regulatory compliance and all our competitors in Europe did not, so they grew much faster but, interestingly enough, none of them exists anymore,” Klanschek said.  Seven years after launching, Bitpanda plans to become the trading platform in Europe, competing with major fintech companies including Wise, Revolut and Trade Republic.  Austria is over 60% covered by the Alps, which is great for skiing. The nation is not particularly known for technical innovation. For a long time, the European country ignored cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, which allowed Bitpanda to build freely. With more regulatory attention the company faced more uncertainty about what it could and could not do.  “We went to regulators and showed them what we built, and oftentimes they were hesitant because they were unsure about the regulation on that,” Klanschek said.  The company has more than doubled in size every year. Revenues are expected to rise sevenfold this year, Demuth said in an interview with CNBC.  A lot of Bitpanda’s success is thanks to being at the right place at the right time. “Everything played together, and I think this is not something we did special,” Klanschek said. “With all this money flowing into Europe, especially from U.S. venture capital (VC) funds, it’s getting a lot easier to grow.” The company’s latest funding round was led by Valar Ventures, the U.S. VC fund backed by Peter Thiel.  Bitpanda has been profitable for five years, according to Demuth.  “I hate unprofitable companies,” Klanschek said. Business models must be self-sustaining. “It’s a really bad situation to be in” to depend on outside funding sources “because you’ll always need to fundraise. You’re working for somebody else because if they stop giving you money, you need to run to other people and it’s really stressful.”  Bitpanda is now on track for an initial public offering (IPO) and has grown from the three co-founders (including Christian Trummer) to more than 600 employees.  Klanschek has always been a big fan of the financial independence movement and has long advocated that cryptocurrency can work for people, unlike fiat currency, which loses value because of inflation. It’s not surprising that he founded a finance company, Klanschek said. “For me, the goal was always to get to a point where I can do stuff I want to.”  Klanschek said U.S. and other European fintech companies are far ahead of Bitpanda. But Klanschek and his co-founders are doing their own thing. While he likes to get advice from people who have already done what his company has yet to accomplish, he doesn’t have a role model to emulate.  “The more you look up to a person, the more flaws you see,” he said, “and I don’t think anybody has the answer to everything. There are so many variables in the world.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/08/30/bitpandas-success-is-thanks-to-timing-and-poker,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e7299288c678d372ab3a1db2ae05b2a41ac13c17-1400x1013.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The fund is worth over $314 million as of press time.  Just in the last week, base layer platforms Celo and Avalanche also released incentive programs worth hundreds of millions of dollars – part of a broader push from competitors to the Ethereum blockchain such as Binance Smart Chain, Polygon and Solana to attract liquidity and users.  Read more: Can Avalanche Keep It Up? DeFi Users Rush In as Incentives Roll Out  While some traders are eager to jump in – Fantom is up 70% on the day, while Celo has rallied 86.6% – some observers worry that the programs could have unintended consequences as mercenary liquidity providers swoop in for short-term gains.  Slicing the DeFi pie  Yield farmers and traders are responding positively to the news, and are expressing willingness to accept carrots from projects looking to bolster their activity and total value locked (TVL) metrics.  “I’m pretty interested to be incentivized by these new platforms,” said a member of eGirl Capital who goes by @DegenSpartan on Twitter.  “Money is a great incentive to bribe people to migrate over assets and explore the ecosystem – as long as nothing blows up,” @DegenSpartan said.  Not all investors, however, believe the competing programs are sustainable. In a tweet this morning, Kyle Samani, co-founder and managing partner at Multicoin Capital, said that the programs may increase the risk of regulatory oversight and that inviting short-term speculators could even stifle growth:  Aligned incentives  But Andre Cronje – founder of Yearn.Finance, a platform that offers automated returns from financial products on Ethereum, and a member of the Fantom Foundation – says Fantom’s program is designed to avoid those pitfalls.  “[It’s] much better to incentivize builders that can attract liquidity, than to simply incentivize the same teams over and over to attract liquidity locusts,” Cronje said in an interview with CoinDesk.  “We believe that builders are the best ones to judge where funds should be allocated, whether they should be provided to build the protocol, or if they need to be used for liquidity mining,” Fantom said in its announcement, adding:  “Rather than playing favorites and providing a majority of our resources to a handful of protocols, we’re opening this up to every dev team that will deploy on Fantom.”  Read more: Celo Taps Aave, Curve, Sushi and More in $100M DeFi Incentive Program  Fantom’s program will distribute FTM tokens to projects that maintain TVL thresholds for set periods of time, targeting projects that surpass $5 million and $100 million. Disbursed funds can then be used for liquidity mining or protocol expansion efforts, such as hiring, at the project’s discretion.

42421762,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpNwz,1630341206,The Shocking Endurance of the Crypto Market,"This morning, hedge fund manager John Paulson gifted us with a lovely rendition of a classic tune: “Crypto Is Fundamentally Worthless.” Personally, I find it hard to top JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon’s version, but it’s nice to revisit the classics.  They don’t play that song much on the radio anymore in large part because crypto markets have begun to shake off their well-earned reputation for volatility. The current market – whether you’re still a bull or think we’re in a trap – certainly hasn’t conformed to the historical pattern.  That pattern, basically, has been waves of hype leading to frenzied FOMO buying, then a vicious blow-off top followed by a dormant period. After the bull runs of 2017 and (if you know where to zoom in on the chart) 2013, crypto took dives on the order of 50%, and then bumbled along a rough bottom. Bitcoin, which for most of its existence has closely mirrored the broader crypto market, traded near or below $10,000 for 32 months after the January 2018 crash. It was a cold and loveless winter, let me tell you.  Based on that pattern, I confidently predicted back in 2020 that the then-new crypto bull market would top out with bitcoin somewhere north of $30,000 and then, as it had several times before, retrace to around the previous 2019 high of $20,000.  I was wildly wrong on both counts.  First, of course, bitcoin went to $63,000 back in April, which I think it’s fair to say surprised even vigorous short-term bulls.  But the real shock has been the market’s behavior since then. The bull run itself ran a robust seven months from October to April, a bit shorter than the run in 2017, which ran from April to January 2018 before collapsing. After the delirious peak this April, it started to look like the script would play out, with BTC crashing nearly 50% in 10 days in May. Things stabilized, but they stabilized at various times in 2018 on the way to a long, slow slump.  But then in late July, bitcoin and markets bounced back, climbing 60% through August. That brings us to nearly a full year of basically positive crypto markets, minus a couple of dips and pauses. That’s a first. Obviously, price is not a measure of utility, but this endurance makes it a lot harder to take Paulson’s purely dismissive stance.  This could, of course, be a classic “bull trap” or “dead cat bounce.” The dramatic crash that history predicts may still be still coming. The likelihood of that depends on the conditions that have led to the current strong run.  That partly includes broader asset market conditions: The Dow Jones Industrial Average has also gone bonkers over the last year and a half, at least in part thanks to the investing classes being trapped at home, both bored and not spending money. So I’d say about half of the future of bitcoin and crypto prices depends on broader economic sentiment. The Delta variant of the coronavirus is the biggest looming shadow, though the devastation in countries without vaccine access is going to have a deeper impact eventually. The prospect of inflation, though fading, is still also a worry for some.  But what changed in the crypto markets themselves, and are those changes enough to sustain current crypto price levels?  At a very high level, the past six months have been jam-packed with transformative milestones for crypto, above all bitcoin adoption in El Salvador and the U.S. infrastructure bill taxation fight. Those are legitimizing crypto, whether or not they have direct market impacts.  More directly, the ongoing and truly mind-boggling frenzy around non-fungible tokens (NFT) is going to keep attention around crypto for at least a few more months – though the direct benefit is to Ethereum. The NFT trend is drawing a whole new group of people into crypto overall at a time when the market should, according to history, be flagging.  That may be the most striking and promising aspect of this unprecedented crypto market – it’s being sustained, not by speculation, but by actual use. Speculation in NFTs is, of course, widespread, and you might think they’re fatally silly, but there’s some form of actual there there.  That’s ultimately what’s needed to avoid another crypto winter: sustainable, continuing and, most important, revenue-generating use cases.

The round, one of the single-largest hauls for a project building on Polkadot’s multi-chain network, comes just months after Parallel’s $2 million pre-seed round of funding. Polychain Capital led the round with participation from Lightspeed Venture Partners, Slow Ventures, Blockchain Capital and Alameda Research.  Parallel looks to bolster growth as a DeFi alternative to Ethereum, the market leader despite low processing speed and high fees. Polkadot, a competing ecosystem that plugs into multiple blockchains, doesn’t yet have as robust a protocol landscape.  Parallel’s answer is a suite of automated market making, staking and derivatives services for polkadot as well as its staging-ground counterpart, kusama.  Project founder Yubo Ruan said Parallel has amassed 3,000 users in the five months after launch. Many of them are institutional – his backers included.  “The reason that we bring a lot of investors – especially Polychain leading the round – is because they are one of the largest DOT holders and kusama (KSM) holders. They want to have yield in this space, they want to have use of DeFi protocols” he said.  Read more: Lending Startup Parallel Finance Raises $2M to Bring More DeFi to Polkadot, Kusama  He said Polychain and its VC counterparts received Parallel’s governance tokens in lieu of traditional equity payouts. “We plan to do an equity [round in a] holding company in the future once we launch the protocol,” said Ruan.  Next steps  Ruan said Parallel plans to double its staff in the next six months. Right now it wields 20 full-timers; five months ago it was just him.  The heady growth is necessary to keep up with expansion demands: Ruan wants to hire specialty engineers that can build for ecosystems other than just Polkadot. Ruan said Parallel will become an umbrella “brand” with footholds across multiple blockchains.  “We believe in a multichain future. Polkadot is one of them that will do well, Ethereum is going to do well too, solana is going to do well. Whenever we find problems in the space related to DeFi,” that’s where Parallel will build, he said.

The Latin American cryptocurrency exchange also said Monday Daniel Mangabeira will be its new global head of public policy, part of a major hiring initiative fueled by Bitso’s $250 million funding round in May.  Smith, former VP of corporate development at Facebook, will focus on expanding Bitso’s Brazilian business, the company said in a statement, adding that he will also “play a large role in mapping out Bitso’s evolution within the continuously growing crypto space.”  After establishing itself in Argentina and Mexico, the company now plans to expand in Brazil, where it will compete against local exchange Mercado Bitcoin, which in July raised $200 million from SoftBank.  Daniel Vogel, Bitso’s CEO and co-founder, said that “Vaughan brings invaluable expertise that will help drive growth and strengthen our vision of the future of finance.”  “There is so much crypto can offer in Latin America, from making financial freedom accessible to millions of unbanked individuals to providing options not offered by the traditional financial system,” Smith said in a statement.  Mangabeira, who was Uber’s head of public policy in Latin America, will help the company build a public policy team and address regulatory issues.  In May, Bitso raised its Series C funding round at a $2.2 billion valuation. It was the region’s first cryptocurrency company to exceed a $1 billion valuation.  The company said that since 2021 it has expanded its team by more than 200% and plans to “continue scaling up aggressively.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE,Andrés Engler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/08/30/crypto-exchange-bitso-hires-facebook-veteran-as-first-coo,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1d35d9524398288155292ea085bf736a92a803de-5760x3840.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

From December 2020 until March, Centre CEO David Puth was the only Centre employee and the consortium was run by its founding companies. (Circle co-founder Sean Neville served as an adviser to Puth.) The new hires will allow Centre to open its membership to organizations other than Circle and Coinbase.  “I would venture comfortably that we’ve been operational as a company for the last four or five months.” Puth said. “I could almost say we’ve been operational as a company since I joined in December, but what this has really enabled us to do is respond directly to the community of users, both proactively and reactively. This really enables us to lay the groundwork for building the Centre consortium that we look forward to getting underway hopefully later this year.”  The new hires include:  Former PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) partner John Shipman joins as chief commercial officer.

Working in collaboration with Ethereum-native protocols such as Aave, Curve, Sushi, PoolTogether, 0x and UMA – as well as Ethereum infrastructure providers such as Chainlink, RabbitHole and The Graph – the program “will offer more than $100 million in educational initiatives, grants, and incentives,” according to the announcement.  While the incentive program bears similarity to big-budget liquidity mining incentive programs from Polygon and Avalanche, Celo founder Rene Reinsberg said in an interview with CoinDesk that the specifics of Celo’s implementation are tailored to attract a broader audience to decentralized finance (DeFi).  “The goal, over the next five years, is to bring one billion new people to DeFi,” he said, adding:  “By starting this initiative now we hope to make this more of an industry-wide effort, and I think it’s kind of complementary to other programs and efforts that we’ve seen.”  Reinsberg noted a number of innovations, such as an “ultra-light” client that allows users to sync with the Celo chain from a mobile phone, and overhauling front-ends for Ethereum-native applications for what he called superior user interfaces on a handheld device.  Read more: Can Avalanche Keep It Up? DeFi Users Rush In as Incentives Roll Out  Additionally, Celo has previously had some success using microgrants to educate users in Colombia on decentralized lending and digital assets. Reinsberg told CoinDesk that a large portion of the $100 million budget is open-ended for similar on-the-ground efforts.  POOL jumps first  No-loss savings game PoolTogether will be the first to launch under the program, with $500,000 in prizes.  Reinsberg said the Celo team “absolutely loves” PoolTogether as a “easy-to-understand” use case with a particular fit for users looking to save with smaller budgets, which is the core demographic Celo is targeting.  “The most pressing or obvious use case we’ve seen in our work all around the world has been in savings and lending,” Reinsberg said. “Our microloan pilot in Colombia was fascinating because there was no other path to those entrepreneurs to get access to capital and to actually start working, so once you’re able to help someone on this path – and digital assets are enabling that – you’re starting to set the foundation for a lot of other services they might want to tap into.”  Read more: Lossless Lottery PoolTogether Opens Up to More Coins, More Prizes  DeFi’s big guns  Following PoolTogether will be Aave, Curve and Sushi with a combined $34 million in incentives.  The platforms will launch on Celo in “the coming weeks and months,” per the announcement, likely after the launch of Celo’s forthcoming Optics cross-chain communication and Ethereum bridge protocol.  Reinsberg told CoinDesk the program is the culmination of years of testing and planning.  “This feels like a bit of a big milestone,” he said. “There’s a lot of work that feeds into actually making this possible that everyone is really proud of. We’ve seen glimpses with the pilots we’ve already run, and that’s given us the confidence to go big with this initiative.”  Added Reinsberg:  “The time is now.

42421758,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpNrp,1630323411,Crypto Long & Short: The End of Extreme Leverage,"The proverbial punch bowl known as 100 times leverage has been replaced with a weaker blend. Nevertheless, the party is picking up again in the cryptocurrency markets.  Leverage, or trading with borrowed money, is a time-honored method of juicing investors’ profits (or compounding their losses, depending which way the market moves). In traditional markets like stocks, investors typically put up half the value of the trade.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.  But crypto loves to live dangerously, and until recently exchanges such as Binance and FTX allowed traders to enter into futures or perpetual contracts with as little as 1% down. That changed last month amid growing regulatory and press scrutiny of the market.  FTX lowered its maximum leverage for these derivatives to 20 times, and Binance announced a similar move (which it said was implemented a week prior). BitMEX, whose former executives are facing trial in the U.S., still offers 100 times leverage, but its current CEO said in July that such aggressive borrowing is “very rare” on the platform.  While these actions seemed to signal the end of an exuberant era, they arguably capped off a trend that began months earlier.  “Overall, the amount of leverage in the system is significantly less than it was early in 2021,” said Kristin Boggiano, co-founder and president of CrossTower, a digital asset trading platform that caters to institutions and professional traders. “As prices moved significantly lower from the highs in April, we saw long leverage flushing out of the market.”  Winds of change  And flushed out it has stayed, even as prices rebounded.  “The recent run-up off of the lows in July does not appear to be based upon leverage,” said Boggiano, a former regulator and Wall Street lawyer.  Her inference is based on a comparison between the markets for these derivative instruments and the underlying assets.  “Earlier in the year, we saw the futures market trading significantly above spot [prices], indicating leverage,” she said. “Today, the difference between the spot and futures or perpetuals is much less.”  Indeed, according to data from derivatives analytics firm Skew, the last time bitcoin broke above $50,000, in mid-February, the average one-month futures premium across exchanges was more than 40% on an annualized basis. Now, as bitcoin flirts with the $50,000 mark again, the premium is down to 8%.  Another sign of decreased leverage is that funding rates (the cost of holding long positions in perpetual futures) has dropped to three to four basis points per eight hours from 15 basis points per eight hours back in February.  Calmer waters  Lower systemic leverage, in turn, suggests the crypto markets, famous for their wild swings, might become a touch tamer.  “Ultimately, it should dampen volatility,” said Hunter Merghart, an executive in residence and venture partner at Castle Island Ventures. “In my view, a lot of the volatility in the past was due to auto liquidations” – that is, peremptorily closing out a trader’s losing bet and selling their collateral.  Given that most perpetual futures are initiated so close to expiration that they are effectively part of the spot market (most exchanges have them roll over every eight hours), auto liquidations can have a cascading effect, amplifying the market moves that triggered them.  There is already evidence of newfound equanimity. The breakout above $50,000 seen this week was quite calm compared to intense price action observed in mid-February. Notably, one-month implied volatility, or expectations for price turbulence, has remained flat around 85% this week. Back in mid-February, it was well above 100%, according to Skew.  To be clear: As in any market, there are many variables that can cause prices to fluctuate, such as money flows.  “We’re seeing a lot of these traditional [investors] now stepping in, especially at the end of the summer here, people are finally ready to play in the sandbox,” said Jason Urban, co-head of trading at Galaxy Digital, a crypto merchant bank. “New money coming in in chunks and coming in in large quantities is going to [cause] a volatility increase.”  Regulatory uncertainty is another wild card that could send prices soaring or tumbling depending on how different agencies come down on different questions, Urban said. “There is headline risk in both directions.”  Cautionary tales  Several market participants said they believed the extreme leverage was rarely employed when it was on offer.  The primary users were “stay-at-home punters,” said Fred Schebesta, founder of Finder.com, the Australian price comparison site, which among other activities brokers crypto. “Most of the very sophisticated, institutional-style traders, I don’t think they’re going anywhere near 100x.” At most they might take on 25 times leverage, if not 20 or 10, he said.  And with good reason because highly leveraged trading is always a risky proposition, not least of all in the wildly fluctuating crypto markets.  “I can tell you from my FX trading days, you don’t last very long at 100x,” said James Putra, a foreign exchange veteran who is now head of product strategy at TradeStation, a technology and brokerage firm. “Bitcoin, when you just use cash, has crazy volatility, even without any leverage. You throw leverage in there and it moves very quickly. It cuts hard both ways.”  Schebesta, who also founded and sold a crypto brokerage called HiveEx, warned that even modestly leveraged bets, when they succeed, can encourage traders to borrow dicier amounts.  “Say you punt at 10x,” he said. “You make a win, you get some confidence, you start cranking it up to [the] 20s. You make another win, it’s a bigger win. Then you punt again and you say ‘well, I can handle big leverage’ so you put in 50x. And it moves the wrong way.”  Rather than learning a lesson, a trader might then go up to 75 times leverage in a bid to win back the loss on the last trade.  “You get into this spiral where you have to put more money in and things get a little out of control,” Schebesta said, adding ominously, “I know some really sad stories.”  Big picture  Schebesta was quick to add that crypto exchanges give users greater control over the amount of risk they take than providers of some mainstream trading products, such as contracts for difference (CfDs), which are popular in the U.K.  “It is very transparent in crypto. You actively slide the bar,” he said. “In other markets, CfDs particularly, no one has any idea how to turn the leverage down.”  The takeaway is not necessarily to fear or avoid risk, but to be aware and manage it. “The whole thing is the person’s choice,” Schebesta said. “That’s what crypto empowers people to do.”  One could further argue that however crazy 100 times leverage may sound, at least Binance, FTX and BitMex were out in the open with what they were doing. During the subprime frenzy of the early 2000s, big banks and Wall Street firms added layers of leverage behind the scenes by endlessly repackaging home loans into mortgage-backed securities into collateralized debt obligations into CDO-squareds. We all know how that story ended.  Putra agreed that, in one sense, crypto is more transparent than the traditional markets where he used to work.  “What you didn’t see on the FX side was the 200-to-1 [leverage] that the banks had, and the hedge funds were getting these enormous leverages,” he said. “That was probably a little bit more transparent if you were in the business and you knew who some of the players were and what you could get as an institution.”  A caveat is that a lot of crypto trading happens on an over-the-counter (OTC) basis, invisible to the exchanges’ public order books. “I think there’s still an opaqueness to the OTC market,” Putra said, though he expects this to improve over time.  The blossoming of decentralized finance (DeFi), where lending happens on-chain rather than at centralized platforms and anyone can review the open-source code governing smart contracts, promises to make leverage in the digital asset markets even more transparent.  “You don’t need to work at a bank to know who’s doing what,” Merghart said.

As most of the Bitcoin mining takes place with the help of coal power plants, the carbon footprint it leaves behind is massive. Luckily there are several energy-efficient cryptocurrencies that can be invested in as an alternative for Bitcoin. Also, these cryptocurrencies are on the rise and make up for a great early investment opportunity. Here is a list of the top five energy-efficient cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin Latinum Bitcoin Latinum is one of the most energy-efficient cryptocurrencies that is built on the same ideology as Bitcoin. However, instead of the power-consuming Proof of Work consensus algorithm, Bitcoin Latinum utilized Proof of Stake, which requires the nodes to validate the transaction for mining new currencies. Bitcoin Latinum (LTNM) is a next-gen Bitcoin fork that is greener, faster, and safer than Bitcoin. LTNM aims to bring faster transaction speed, lower costs, and better security to several high-growth markets, including Media, Telecommunications, Gaming, and Cloud Computing. Nano Nano has one of the smallest energy footprints in the crypto ecosystem, of 0.000112 kWh per transaction.

While SOL has gained more than 5% in the past 24 hours, prices for bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies have remained steady or been lower. SOL has more than doubled in the past two weeks, largely on the back of the boom in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  The total value locked (TVL) in Solana-based DeFi applications has risen to an all-time high above $3 billion, marking a 400% increase over the past 30 days, according to data provided by Defi Llama.

Tokenomics, or the token economics behind these blockchain-based assets, are completely redefining the way companies fundraise and implement business models. However, this evolution has also brought about complex regulatory, economical and technical challenges that can sway many from adopting token frameworks. For example, projects offering existing tokens have weak utility behind their tokens. This usually leads to poor demand and purpose behind the token. Apart from that, not every project has the proper know-how to create a strong token economy, which is vital to the long-term growth of the project. Furthermore, launching a token is tricky as most projects (blockchain-based or not) certainly don&apos;t want their token to be categorized as investment securities. Thankfully, IQ Protocol, developed by PARSIQ can solve all of these problems. IQ Protocol offers an innovative circular economy model allowing projects, enterprise firms and organizations to issue and manage compliant tokens.

The attack was first reported by PeckShield in a tweet early on Monday. The blockchain security firm pointed to Ethereum records showing at least $6 million were drained at 5:44 UTC.  Cream Finance later confirmed the hack in a tweet, adding that 418,311,571 AMP tokens and 1,308.09 ether had been stolen, bringing the total value of the hack to just over $25 million. PeckShield updated its estimate, saying the hacker siphoned off about $18.8 million.  The root cause of the incident was lending of AMP tokens, Cream Finance Product Manager Eason Wu said on Discord. Other assets on Cream are secure, he said.  AMP token contracts allowed for a reentrancy attack, the same type of exploit used in the infamous DAO hack.

After jumping towards the all-time high of $3.026 on Friday, ADA faced rejection once more at $2.96, suggesting that it might take a few more attempts to unlock the $3 threshold.
