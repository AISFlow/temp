Bankman-Fried's defense team told the Department of Justice and the court earlier this year that he intended to argue that FTX counsel ""were involved"" in certain decisions that the company made. But this argument, without specifics, may confuse or prejudice a jury, Judge Lewis Kaplan wrote in an order dated Sunday. While he blocked the defense team referring to external counsel in his opening statement, Bankman-Fried's attorneys can try to raise the issue later if they notify the judge and DOJ first, without jurors in the room.  The defense team announced in August that Bankman-Fried planned to argue that both in-house FTX attorneys and lawyers with the firm Fenwick & West were involved in decisions to use auto-deleting messaging services like Signal, creating the ""North Dimension"" entities, FTX entities' banking relationship with Silvergate Bank, loans to FTX and Alameda Research executives, intercompany agreements and FTX's terms of service. The DOJ argued that Bankman-Fried's defense team had not provided enough detail on its argument, and should be blocked from making it.  In his ruling, the judge said the phrasing of the various filings raise questions about ""what would constitute 'undue' focus on attorney involvement,"" ""what could suggest inappropriately that attorneys had 'blessed' a particular course of conduct"" and what legal theory would allow evidence that met the first two questions.  ""Whether and to what extent the defendant should be permitted to argue or adduce evidence regarding the presence or involvement of lawyers will depend on the circumstances. The best that can be done for now is to ensure that the Court will have sufficient notice to make appropriate rulings on a case-by-case basis,"" the judge wrote.

As earlier reported, some 5,000 ETH (equivalent to $8.2 million) was transferred from the flagged address (identified as 0x3e9) to new addresses on Saturday. However, in the latest development, blockchain data tracker Spot On Chain revealed that the FTX exploiter has moved more than $17 million worth of Ether tokens in the past 24 hours. FTX Exploiter To Keep Moving Stolen Funds, Spot On Chain Speculates In one of the most significant exploits in the crypto space, the now-defunct FTX exchange fell victim to a hack a few hours after declaring bankruptcy, leading to a loss of more than $600 million. According to an on-chain revelation, the exploiter has been moving huge chunks of their loot in the past 24 hours. The transferred funds have reached a total of 10,250 ETH (worth roughly $17.2 million), spread across five addresses. Related Reading: Ethereum ETF: Valkyrie Halts Purchase Of ETH Futures Contracts A breakdown by Spot On Chain shows that a significant 7,749 ETH (equivalent to about $13 million) was moved to the Thorchain router and Railgun contract.

Within the past day, the FTX exploiter has executed swap transactions involving 2,500 ETH (worth approximately $4.19 million).

However, there has been no substantial evidence to back up these connections. There have been speculations that the exploiter might be looking to dump their tokens should the ETH price rally after futures ETFs are greenlighted. In any case, spectators will probably keep an eye on the address’ activity, especially after Spot On Chain suggested the exploiter may keep transferring ETH.

18255379,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553659,1696164932,"Crypto Analyst Tips Bitcoin (BTC) To Reach $40,000 In Q4 2023","Bitcoin has recorded an overall positive price movement in the last week, gaining by 2.39%, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The premier cryptocurrency suffered a slight dip between Tuesday and Thursday but soon rose on Friday to trade above $27,000 again. Meanwhile, in celebrating the new month of October, popular crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe has predicted an incoming bullish run for Bitcoin in Q4 2033 based on certain expected events. Related Reading: New Bitcoin Prediction: Analyst Backs BTC To Reach $34,500 In 2024 Analyst Projects Bitcoin To Reach $40K In Q4 2023 Starting With A Positive ‘Uptober’ Via a post on X on October 1, Michaël van der Poppe welcomed his 667,000 followers to October with much optimism towards the BTC market, renaming the month as “Uptober.” In general, the well-known analyst believes the crypto bear market is almost over, and Bitcoin could soon record some significant gains, as he expressed in a previous post on September 30. Interestingly, van de Poppe’s optimism extends beyond October to the whole of Q4 2023, as he predicts Bitcoin could attain $40,000 before the year runs out. Albeit, this prediction is hinged on the occurrence of certain events. Firstly, Michaël van der Poppe mentions the potential approval of ETF applications. The ongoing Bitcoin spot ETF saga in the US has drawn much attention over the last few months due to its possible effects on the BTC market. Currently, analysts are quite optimistic about the chances of approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF, which could result in massive gains for the largest crypto asset upon realization. Realistically, this approval could occur in Q4 2023, as it contains the second deadline date for most applications. However, the US Securities and Exchange Commission could decide to delay its responses to these proposals till the final deadlines, most of which are slated for Q1 2024. The US securities regulator is already employing such tactics, as seen with the first deadline dates for most applications. In the last week, the SEC also announced it would be pushing back its response to certain applications beyond their second deadline date. These applications included proposals from BlackRock, 21Shares, Bitwise, and Valkyrie. Source: Bloomberg Intelligence Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash Bulls Charge: 13% Price Rally Driven By Fresh Demand The Bitcoin Pre-Halving Rally In addition to potential ETF approvals, Michaël van de Poppe also mentioned a possible bitcoin pre-halving rally as a factor that could spur the asset growth to $40,000 in Q4 2023. Historically, the months leading up to the halving event are marked by a Bitcoin rally, as seen in 2012 and 2016. Based on van de Poppe’s prediction, he foresees a similar BTC price movement in the coming months ahead of the next Bitcoin halving set for April 2024, during which the mining rewards will be slashed from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. However, investors should take note of black swan events, as seen with the last Bitcoin halving in 2020. In the months before this halving event occurred, the BTC pre-halving rally was temporarily affected by the negative market effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $27.138 with a 1.07% gain in the last day. Meanwhile, the asset’s daily trading volume is down by 21.37% and valued at $6.28 billion.

However, this little price movement could be brief, as the number of XRP tokens in circulation just increased by 1 billion XRP, around 1.87% of the circulating supply of 53.312 billion tokens.

Potential Impact On XRP Price And Supply On-chain data from Whale_Alerts has shown bouts of XRP totaling 1 billion have been unlocked from escrow in three transactions from two separate wallets.

With the current market price of XRP at $0.5177, this puts the value of the unlocked tokens over $514.6 million. 🔓 🔓 🔓 🔓 🔓 🔓 🔓 🔓 🔓 🔓 500,000,000 #XRP (257,393,344 USD) unlocked from escrow at #Ripplehttps://t.co/1lSZdeqcMS — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) October 1, 2023 Ripple’s latest unlock is part of the periodic release in its plan to release 55 billion XRP tokens over 55 months. Since 2017, the payment company has been known to release 1 billion XRP tokens each month through a smart contract. While Ripple claims this helps increase liquidity and utility, it also means a major influx of new coins entering circulation. With more XRP available, the price often drops as supply outweighs demand. Each new release adds downward pressure, and the price frequently falls in the days leading up to and following the escrow unlocking. SOL market cap currently at $9.5 billion on the weekend chart: TradingView.com The monthly escrow has led to significant price slumps in the past months, especially during periods of lower interest in XRP. In particular, XRP witnessed a major selloff in June as whales dumped around 120 million XRP after Ripple unlocked its escrow. Ripple has been known to periodically relock a portion of released tokens into the escrow system to reduce selling pressure, which helps extend the runway for the remaining tokens to be unlocked. For instance, Ripple immediately relocked 800 million (80%) of September’s token unlock. The total amount to be locked back in escrow this month is yet to be determined.

Since July, BCH holders have continuously maintained a positive perspective, which has reduced the frequency of selling activity. This collective sentiment has played a significant role in the upward trajectory of BCH, consequently yielding favorable outcomes for these holders. The price of BCH has increased by about 13% over the previous week, giving it some of the biggest gains in the last seven days for cryptocurrency assets. According to CoinMarketCap data, the altcoin was trading at $234.78 at the time of publication. The value of the world’s cryptocurrency market dropped to $1.06 trillion at the time of writing, a 0.1% decrease in a day. On Thursday, ETH increased by about 0.8% to $1,629, while Bitcoin (BTC) rose slightly above the $27K level. Can Bitcoin Cash Reach New ATH This Year? BCH is anticipated to undergo a trial of the support line at a value of $229, after which a subsequent rebound is projected. The breach of the current barrier at $253 is crucial for the potential rise of the altcoin. If this level is surpassed, it might pave the way for the altcoin to achieve new 2023 highs, beyond the $300 mark. BCH market cap currently at $4.6 billion on the weekend chart: TradingView.com Bitcoin Cash has increased by a remarkable 90% in the last six months, demonstrating strong performance. Furthermore, the price of BCH has been up significantly by 136% so far this year, maintaining a favorable return.

Source: Santiment Long-Term Holder Addresses Up But on September 26, their holdings had increased to 3.86 million BCH, showing a noteworthy acquisition of 120,000 BCH in just one week. Their balances are now comparable to what they were in July 2023 thanks to this accumulation, and the 120,000 BCH that the Bitcoin Cash whales purchased are worth about $25.6 million at the current market price of $213 per BCH.

This support from long-term holders, combined with whale accumulation, could help BCH reach or exceed $300 in the future (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice.
