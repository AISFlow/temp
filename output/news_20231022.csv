19223039,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=556509,1697985639,New SHIB-Based Token On The Way? Shiba Inu Team Member Shares Important Update,"The Shiba Inu ecosystem is one of the fastest growing communities in the crypto industry. The meme cryptocurrency has come a long way in a short time with lots of tokens and updates to its ecosystem, but it certainly still has a long way to go. In a recent not-so-surprise announcement, a core member of the Shiba Inu team hinted that a new stablecoin called Shi may be in the works. If the rumors are true, this could be huge news for SHIB holders and open up a whole new world of possibilities within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Related Reading: Solana On Fire With Over 34% Rally Within A Week – Details New SHIB-Based Token On The Way Taking to a post on social media platform X, Vet Kusama, a member of the Shiba Inu team, talked about the purpose of a stablecoin earlier highlighted by SHIB founder Ryoshi. Shi would be a stablecoin, meaning a cryptocurrency pegged 1:1 to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar to keep its value stable. Ok. What is Shi? Shi is part of the shiba ecosystem that will serve as a stablecoin in the shibarium chain. In article Ryoshi talked about Shi, although not technically, what Shi’s purpose was. So why do we need a stablecoin? Stable currencies play a major role in projects… pic.twitter.com/JPoB2d1Oux — Vet KUSAMA ™ (@vetkusama) October 19, 2023 As demonstrated by BUSD on the BSC chain, the concept of a stablecoin is to give investors a chance to participate in the cryptocurrency sector while experiencing lower levels of volatility. Vet Kusama draws a parallel to BUSD, noting that the workings of the SHI on Shibarium would be likened to BUSD on the BSC chain. There are no doubts about what a stablecoin would do for Shiba Inu, as it would give the overall ecosystem more utility and, according to Kusama, a ‘trading volume growth.’ We still don’t know the specifics of how Shi will work, as no official information has been released. However, the team member did mention that there would be no pre-purchases or airdrops. Related Reading: Stacks (STX) Rockets 26% Higher In A Single Week: The Factors At Play SHIB market cap currently at $4.125 Billion chart: TradingView.com What’s Next For Shiba Inu? The Shiba Inu ecosystem is already home to SHIB, BONE, and LEASH tokens that users can stake, swap, or deposit into liquidity pools on ShibaSwap. These tokens are all doing relatively well with many investors and whale accumulation occasionally. However, a SHIB-based stablecoin could attract new investors to the Shiba Inu ecosystem, especially those who don’t want to be exposed to crypto volatility. Shi may also make it easier for Shiba Inu holders to buy and sell goods or services using their crypto, as demonstrated by the fish vendor example given by Ryoshi in a Medium article.

As the BTC market continues its battle against the $30,000 resistance zone, Bitcoin critic and gold advocate Peter Schiff has weighed in on the ongoing discourse surrounding the potential effects of the approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Related Reading: Bitcoin ETF Approval Anticipated To Trigger Fiat Influx Of $24-50 Billion Bitcoin ETF Will Not Boost Institutional Investment, Schiff Says In a post on X on Saturday, Peter Schiff stated that contrary to popular beliefs, the availability of more Bitcoin ETFs will likely not result in a higher level of institutional investment in the world’s largest crypto asset. Schiff’s heavy take comes at a time in which several asset managers are currently trying to gain approval to launch the first-ever spot Bitcoin ETF in the US. Since the onset of this ETF saga in June, many market analysts have lauded the potential positive effects a spot Bitcoin ETF could produce, with some predicting BTC’s price to trade above $100,000. According to a recent report by blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant, the approval of a spot market ETF could result in BTC attaining a market cap of $900 billion and a total crypto market cap growth of $1 trillion. However, Peter Schiff presents an opposing theory to this debate as he believes investment brokers will likely not be purchasing such funds for their clients due to certain “liability.” In this context, “liability” likely refers to the risk factors attached to crypto investments, which include the crypto market volatility and lack of clear regulations in the US, among others. Peter Schiff believes that with such existing “liability,” investment professionals will not promote or recommend a Bitcoin ETF to their clients. In the best-case scenario, he states that investment in Bitcoin ETFs – including a spot Bitcoin ETF – will likely occur through unsolicited buy orders whereby a client makes a specific request to purchase such funds. Related Reading: Pro-XRP Lawyer Reacts To Elon Musk And Mark Cuban’s Amicus Brief To SEC The ETF Saga Continues In other news, the Bitcoin ETF saga has garnered more attention in recent weeks as more bullish predictions continue to roll in. Most recently, Paul Grewal, Chief Legal Officer at Coinbase, stated that the American largest exchange is confident the SEC will definitely greenlight a spot Bitcoin ETF following the commission’s recent court loss against Grayscale. Meanwhile, certain asset managers, including BlackRock and Ark Invest, have reviewed their ETF applications, indicating signs of an ongoing dialogue with the SEC, a move which typically precedes an approval by the securities regulator. For now, it remains unknown if a spot Bitcoin ETF will eventually grace the US markets, but analysts have penned down January 10 as the expected date of approval. Thereafter, Peter Schiff’s theory can be put to the test. However, it is worth stating that BTC did gain by 7% on October 16 following the fake news on the approval of BlackRock iShares ETF. At the time of writing, BTC trades at $29,890.35 with a 0.6% gain in the last day. Meanwhile, the token’s daily trading volume is down by 12.67% and valued at $13.35 billion BTC trading at $29,885.27 on the hourly chart | Source: BTCUSDT chart on Tradingview.com Featured image from American Enterprise Institute, chart from Tradingview",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-critic-kicks-against-spot-etf-hype-predicts-low-institutional-investment/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/19218557.jpeg

19214190,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=556505,1697971120,Chainlink (LINK) Price Hits New Highs With 22% Surge In A Single Day,"Following a week dominated by Bitcoin and its positive performance, Chainlink (LINK) has emerged as one of the best performers in the crypto market this weekend. This comes after a long period of relative silence and sideways movement for the token’s price. The abrupt and significant surge in Chainlink price may have surprised many investors, but it only further highlights the volatile nature of the crypto market. Chainlink Price Soars 22% In One Day – What’s Next? According to data from CoinGecko, the price of Chainlink is up by more than 22% in the last 24 hours. Over the past day, LINK’s double-digit price explosion has seen the altcoin surpass the $9 mark, resulting in a multi-month high. LINK’s performance appears to be even more notable on the weekly chart, with a nearly 30% increase in the last seven days. Although Chainlink maintains a substantial percentage of its gain, the token’s price seems to be facing significant resistance at the $9.5 zone. This reflects the uncertain sentiment of investors who seem unsure whether the current rally is a fluke or a bullish hint. Nevertheless, a crypto analyst expects LINK to build on this positive momentum. Related Reading: Ethereum ICO Participant Wakes Up After 8 Years, Moves $3 Million In ETH In a post on X (formerly Twitter), crypto trader Mags noted that the Chainlink price has just broken out of a consolidation wedge spanning more than a year. The analyst postulates that a close above $8.2 on the weekly timeframe will see the LINK price rise to $12.54. This represents a significant 30% projection from the current price point. As of this writing, the Chainlink token is valued at $9.36. According to CoinGecko data, LINK is enjoying a 468% surge in its trading volume over the past 24 hours. What Is Behind The Multi-Month High? A dive into the Chainlink network activity can help understand the driving force behind the latest resurgence in LINK’s price. Interestingly, a recent report from the on-chain analytics platform Santiment offers insight into the activity levels of the network. Santiment’s data report posted on X highlighted that Chainlink has been experiencing increased activity over the past few days. Specifically, the network witnessed significant growth – reaching three-month highs – in terms of whale transactions, active addresses, and trading volume this weekend.

Furthermore, Chainlink recorded more than 800 million in LINK trading volume on Saturday. While these data points don’t exactly indicate whether buying transactions are the prevailing activity on Chainlink, the ensuing LINK price rally suggests a possible accumulation trend.

6860,http://blokt.com/?p=35317,1697961615,"CEX.IO Extensive Review [2023] – A Safe, Proven Crypto Exchange","CEX.IO manages to balance the provision of an exchange platform with advanced services and an interface that is visually appealing, easy-to-use, and accessible to newer crypto investors. CEX.IO has been in the cryptocurrency business since 2013, starting as a cloud mining provider, and claims to currently have over a million users , ranging from “Bitcoin beginners to institutional traders.” Here’s our CEX.IO exchange review for 2019 That said, CEX.IO does not offer all the features that some crypto traders expect from an advanced digital asset trading platform and it only supports a limited number of cryptocurrencies and trading pairs , so it definitely cannot satisfy the needs of all investors. If CEX.IO sounds like it could be the right fit for you, then please read on. CEX.IO’s time-proven stability and security In this CEX.IO review we will cover all the key facts about the exchange, its main distinguishing features, the registration, and verification process, its fee schedule and then summarize everything we have learned with a quick pros and cons list at the end – where you can decide if it’s the best cryptocurrency exchange for your needs. “Even when Bitcoin price is experiencing harsh times, the Bitcoin index is still hundreds (or at least dozens) times higher than that of a US dollar, Euro, or other fiat currency. If a trader can read charts and draw conclusions based on what he sees, if he can look at the market as a system and clearly see the trends playing a significant role in the Bitcoin price establishment, or simply if he trusts his intuition, then this person can easily join the trading lot. In this case, the opportunity to earn a pretty big sum is worth all the risk.” CEX.IO Blog Quick Facts CEX.IO Facts Sheet Exchange Type: Centralized Fiat-to-Crypto: Yes Crypto-to-Fiat: Yes Crypto-to-Crypto: Yes Number of Fiat Currencies Traded: 4 Number of Cryptocurrencies Traded: 10 Number of Countries Supported: 150+ Number of Fiat Currencies Supported: All Bank Transfers/Deposits: Yes Credit/Debit Cards: Yes Wire Transfers: Yes PayPal: No Exchange Wallet(s): Yes Account Size Limits: No Spending Limit Periods: Yes Margin Trading: Yes Trading Fees: 0.25% or less taker and 0.16% or less maker Deposit/Withdrawal Fees: 2.99% deposit and 3% + $5 withdrawal for credit cards, 1% withdrawal for bank/wire transfers Headquarters: UK Incorporated: UK Go to CEX.IO CEX.IO Features CEX.IO lists several key benefits and features it has to attract clients including a range of payment options, strong security, worldwide coverage, legal compliance, margin trading, reasonable commissions, cross-platform trading, advanced reporting, and high liquidity as can be seen in the screenshot below: Screenshot of CEX.IO homepage – “Why choose CEX.IO?” Let’s take a look at some of these features and others in a bit more detail. Advanced Orders CEX.IO allows users to place advanced order types , specifically limit and stop orders. While this may not sound like much to the uninitiated, these advanced order types are essential for anything beyond the most basic investment strategies . However, some variations of these order types such as a trailing stop that are not yet available on CEX.IO. “If you’re a day trader, then you’ll need to know about stop-loss and take-profit points. These are the price levels where you are going to exit a trade. For example, if you think that the price of bitcoin has reached a support level that it has come to in the past and there are no signs that it will be able to break through that support and go lower, then you may want to place a buy order.” CEX.IO Blog Low Commissions CEX.IO has very low and simple transaction costs. At 0.25% or less for takers and 0.16% or less for makers , CEX.IO is easily competing for the top spots in the industry for lowest transaction fees. Low transaction fees mean more trading strategies become viable, and your trades need to work less hard to make a profit. Note: Maker and taker fees are a way to differentiate between orders that provide liquidity (Makers) and those that take away liquidity (Takers). A market maker is placing an order that may or may not be filled. This standing order adds ‘ liquidity ’ to the market by adding more potential volume that can be traded. A market taker, by contrast, is choosing from existing orders set by market makers and closing these orders down, thereby removing liquidity from the market by removing some of the potentially tradeable volumes. Since exchanges like more liquidity, as it attracts more traders to their venue, they are willing to reward market makers with lower, and sometimes even positive, transaction fees. Go to CEX.IO Recommended CEX.IO Exchange Service Go! Slick Interface If you are new to crypto exchanges, then you probably can’t do much better than CEX.IO’s market interface. We often find that the more advanced trading platforms tend to be intimidating to new crypto traders and investors because of all the flashing lights and scrolling numbers. In our opinion, CEX.IO as an interface with the perfect balance between function and simplicity. Low Credit Card Deposit and Withdrawal Fees The value of low deposit and withdrawal fees for credit card users is hard to overstate. Many crypto investors highly prize the convenience and privacy of using their credit cards to make cryptocurrency transactions. However, not all digital asset exchanges offer this option and those that do often charge extremely high fees for the privilege. CEX.IO Low Fees While not the most competitive in the industry, CEX.IO’s credit card fees (2.99% for deposits) are still well below the market average , and this is a major advantage to a huge range of crypto investors. Note: You can find more information about buying cryptocurrencies with a credit card at CEX.IO and other recommended exchanges in our “ How to buy Bitcoin with a Credit Card ” guide. Margin Trading CEX.IO has its own margin trading platform called CEX.IO Broker, which is currently in beta . The platform offers cryptocurrency trading via contracts for difference (CFDs) and has advanced trading tools, technical analysis instruments, and different order types available. Users will be able to trade Bitcoin and Ethereum with up to 10x leverage when the platform goes live. CEX.IO Broker – Margin trading cryptocurrency CFD platform CEX.IO Affiliate Program CEX.IO allows its users to earn 30% of the commissions from exchange transactions for anyone they refer to the platform. CEX.IO Affiliate Program CEX.IO Listed and Tradable Cryptocurrencies CEX.IO currently has 10 cryptocurrencies listed and available to trade on the exchange. This includes: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, Dash, Litecoin, Ripple’s XRP, Stellar, Zcash, and Gemini Dollar. In April 2020, CEX.IO also announced support for Chainlink (LINK), which is one of the most exciting projects and most-traded assets in the crypto market. Trading of LINK/USD, LINK/EUR, and LINK/GBP are supported on CEX.IO, and users can withdraw LINK from the platform. Go to CEX.IO Registration, Verification, and Crediting Your Account CEX.IO’s verification process is among the most onerous in the industry. Not only does CEX.IO manage to drag the industry-standard verification process of identification documents and proof of address out over more details and pages than its competitors, but it also requires additional selfies be uploaded for each stage and the provision of a tax identification number. CEX.IO Proof of Identity This excessive verification process continues with your payment card, with several additional photos being required, whereas most other crypto exchanges simply require your payment card details. There is also a third level of verification for increased limits and services based on personal income and assets, but in this regard, CEX.IO manages to come closer to the industry standard. CEX.IO have recently introduced Skrill payments, an online payment provider who process fast fiat transfers, which enables customers to credit their CEX.io accounts with British pounds (GBP) and euros (EUR). Users with enhanced and corporate accounts can use Skrill to easily transfer funds to their trading account without the need to wait for lengthy bank transfers. Fees CEX.IO has some of the best fees in the industry , both in terms of transactions and deposit/withdrawal fees. Transaction Fees CEX.IO’s transaction fees are 0.25% or less for takers and 0.16% or less for makers. These fees decline toward zero based on your 30d trade volume. For a breakdown of what taker/maker fees are, please see the note in the Features section above. Credit Card Fees CEX.IO’s deposit and withdrawal fees for credit cards are variables based on the supported currency used (USD, EUR, GBP, RUB) and the volume transacted. You are encouraged to follow the link above to see for yourself in detail, but the most important numbers are the 2.99% deposit and up to 3% + $5 withdrawal fees for USD and 2.99% deposit and up to 1.2% + €5 withdrawal fees for EUR. These are very competitive numbers , though not the best in the industry. Bank Transfer Fees The bank transfer fees are 0 for deposits in all currencies and 1% for USD and €1 for EUR withdrawals. The €1 withdrawal fee is nominal and competitive with the best in the industry, while the 1% fee for USD withdrawals can actually be quite high for large sums, as many competitors will charge zero or flat rate for bank/wire transfers. Pros and Cons Let’s briefly examine how all these factors stack up for CEX.IO with a pros and cons list. Pros Slick interface Good exchange for newer crypto traders and investors Good credit card fee rates Very good transaction fee rates Well established exchange with 0% users funds theft Good knowledge resources for people looking to learn advanced crypto investment and trading Margin trading Affiliate program Cons Low deposit and withdrawal limits for credit cards Lacking features that professional crypto traders would expect from an advanced trading platform Onerous verification process Only 10 coins supported Closing Thoughts CEX.IO is an interesting exchange with some nice feature that will appeal to many cryptocurrency investors and traders. CEX.IO – “Bitcoin exchange you can trust” This includes its safe crypto cold storage, the fact that it’s well-established and never lost any users funds to theft, it has a mobile application, a 24/7 support team , and offers margin trading . In addition, the low transaction and credit card fees make CEX.IO an excellent choice for anyone looking to buy Bitcoin or any other major cryptocurrency using their credit cards. The same can be said if someone wants to sell them, as long as they don’t mind the onerous verification process. Go to CEX.IO Recommended CEX.IO Exchange Service Go!

6869,http://blokt.com/?p=51469,1697961612,The Biggest Leaks Revealed by Edward Snowden,"When 2013 began, the general public had no idea who Edward Joseph Snowden was, but by the end of the year, everyone knew his name. Snowden, a former CIA employee who spent time working with the NSA, decided to share highly classified information with several leading journalists, who then broke the news to the world. It’s no exaggeration to say that Snowden’s astonishing revelations have changed the world as we know it, shedding damning light on intelligence agencies and systems all over the world and making countless people think long and hard about their own privacy, anonymity, and security. “We had a cyber Pearl Harbor. His name was Edward Snowden.” – Ashton Carter, Former Secretary of Defense. Countless stories have been written, and debates have raged in the years since the leak began, and everyone has their view on Snowden and the mind-blowing information he shared with the world. His actions even led to the development of the USA Freedom Act, which was designed to limit the amount and type of data that could be monitored and recorded. However, as Snowden’s leaks revealed, the fact of the matter is that there’s a whole lot of spying and secret data-gathering going on behind the scenes of our lives. There’s still probably plenty that we don’t even know, but Snowden’s info helped to blow the whole thing open. Here are some breakdowns of some of the biggest and most essential revelations he shared. The NSA Can Demand Call Records And Data From Telephone Companies This was one of the first major stories to come out in the wake of the Snowden leaks, but it’s still one of the most important. The initial story showed that Verizon, one of the biggest telephone companies around, was forced to provide the NSA with data and records for almost all of its customers. Later on, we saw that Verizon wasn’t the only company involved in this sort of thing. Other major telephone companies like Sprint and AT&T were also handing over phone records and info to the intelligence agency without customers knowing what was going on. This revelation was enormous and generated significant debate at the time, with many of those debates still ongoing to this day. As a result, then-President, Barack Obama, announced plans to overhaul the NSA’s data collection programs in what would eventually lead to the development of the USA Freedom Act. Triggering A Wave Of Privacy Concerns “When you give up your privacy, you give up your power.” – Thor Benson, Journalist. This first major leak from Snowden also had a big effect on public views about surveillance and privacy. Before then, many people had laughed off the thought of the NSA spying on their phone calls and taking their data behind their backs. The whole notion seemed like something out of a conspiracy theory, but Snowden’s leaks proved that it was very real. From there, the public began to put more focus on protecting their mobile privacy in any way possible, as well as thinking more deeply about privacy and anonymity online through the increased use of VPNs . The Power Of Smurfs Sticking with the phone theme, Snowden’s leaks also taught us that the GCHQ, which is essentially the British version of the NSA, has the terrifying ability to actually control people’s phones, even when they’re switched off. To do this, they make use of a series of tools named after Smurfs, the little blue cartoon characters first created in an old Belgian comic series. The Smurfs And What They Do “There will come a time when it isn’t ‘They’re spying on me through my phone’ anymore. Eventually, it will be ‘My phone is spying on me.'” – Philip K. Dick, Author Snowden revealed that the GCHQ had a whole list of Smurf tools, each with its own use and purpose. Here are some examples: Dreamy Smurf – Has the ability to turn phones on or off remotely Nosey Smurf – Has the ability to make use of the phone’s microphone to listen to conversations and noise in the local area. Tracker Smurf – Has the ability to track your position precisely Paranoid Smurf – Works to hide the activities of the other Smurfs to prevent detection As we can see, the power of these ‘ Smurfs’ is quite terrifying. Naturally, these tools and software programs are only designed to be used against criminals and suspected terrorists, but the very fact that such technology exists was enough to send a shiver down the spine of many members of the general public. PRISM “The government doesn’t want any system of transmitting information to remain unbroken unless it’s under its own control.” – Isaac Asimov, Tales of the Black Widowers By far, one of the scariest revelations for the American public was the existence of PRISM . PRISM was the code name given to an NSA program in which the agency could effectively demand data from major tech and internet companies like Google, Facebook, and Apple. PRISM, it turned out, has been a major source of intelligence for NSA reports, and it was a terrifying thing for the general public to learn about. People did respond, however, through protests, debates, and demonstrations, as well as encouraging each other to start focusing more strongly on protecting privacy and anonymity online. The sorts of content the NSA could collect included search histories, downloads, emails, and more. The focus of the program was to track potential terrorism suspects, but the system effectively allowed for the data of almost any internet user to be taken, making it a huge threat to people’s privacy. The NSA Can Intercept Packages Before They Reach Your Home An astonishing report published in the German newspaper ‘Der Spiegel’ revealed that the NSA has a whole list of scary surveillance systems and methods in place to keep their eyes everywhere and spy on people without them being any the wiser. The report showed that the NSA was able to intercept package deliveries that were on their way to a person’s home. From there, intelligence agents could open up the packages and see what was inside, as well as adding their own espionage tools and software programs. That way, they could effectively find packages that were going into suspects’ homes, add bugs and traces to the items inside, and monitor what the suspect was using the equipment for and what was going on behind closed doors. The ANT Catalog Der Spiegel’s report went on to highlight some of the tools that could be used, comparing the list to a ‘mail-order catalog.’ The tools were all grouped under the acronym ANT , which stands for Advanced Network Technology. Each tool has its own codename and product listing in the ‘catalog,’ which describes its functions and uses. ANT Tool Examples: SURLYSPAWN – Able to log keystrokes on a computer and transmit them wirelessly, even when the computer isn’t connected to the internet CANDYGRAM – Able to imitate a GSM cell phone tower to monitor cell communications FIREWALK – Designed to look just like a regular RJ45 internet socket, this tool can inject and monitor device data via radio waves MONKEYCALENDAR – Able to transmit a cell phone’s geolocation via a secret text message COTTONMOUTH – Designed to look like USB and Ethernet connectors, these tools can hack into computers and provide remote access Again, just like the Smurf tools used by the GCHQ in the United Kingdom, these code named espionage tools and pieces of equipment were very scary to learn about for many people as they proved that NSA agents had access to gear that could make surveillance incredibly easy for them and almost entirely undetectable for their targets. The NSA Can Even Hack Tech Giants An article in The Washington Post stated that the NSA had actually hacked into data centers of major tech giants Google and Yahoo in order to monitor communications and traffic at these centers. This was a particularly scary revelation for members of the general public as it proved that there were almost no limits to what the NSA’s spy tools were capable of. If even the biggest internet companies on the planet could be hacked with such apparent ease, was anyone really safe? It was also shocking for people to see that the NSA was prepared to use its wealth of hacking tools against big American companies. Google and Yahoo both released statements to deny any awareness of the surveillance and express their shock and dismay, with Yahoo even taking action to encrypt its connections. The former CEO of Yahoo, Marissa Meyer, stated that Yahoo would not provide the NSA with any access to its data centers and never had in the past. This helped to reassure many members of the public and general internet users, but a lot of people still worried that big companies were making shady deals behind their backs. Britain’s NSA Spies On Fiber Optic Connections All Over The Globe The GCHQ, Britain’s NSA equivalent, was also revealed to use various surveillance tools to hack into fiber optic cables and connections all over the globe. This is all done under the code name ‘ Tempora ,’ which is a surveillance system that has been running since 2011. This system essentially involved the GCHQ placing interceptors on several hundred fiber optic cables going in and out of the United Kingdom. These interceptors could seize data directly from the cables, with intelligence agents then closely observing and analyzing that data for anything that they might deem interesting or worthy of further investigation. According to Snowden’s leaks, the information gathered by GCHQ via Tempora could also be shared with the NSA, with hundreds of thousands of NSA contractors being able to look at this data. The NSA Collects Contact Lists “There has never been a time in human history where so many people routinely carry recording and surveillance devices.” – Steven Magee, Author. Part of the NSA’s surveillance and anti-terrorism measures also include the collection of countless email and contact lists from internet and smartphone users. Snowden’s leaks showed that up to 250 million of these contact lists could be taken each year. It’s important to note that this system was only used overseas and aimed at non-US citizens, but the fact of the matter is that when literally hundreds of thousands of these lists are being collected all over the globe, and a lot of Americans also happen to be traveling in foreign places, it’s inevitable that their data is also going to be at risk. Boundless Informant Proved That The NSA Spied On Americans Boundless Informant (or BOUNDLESSINFORMANT) is the code name given to a big data analysis tool used by the NSA. This tool basically tracks all of the metadata collected by the NSA around the world and makes a kind of ‘heatmap’ of that data to show where it came from and which countries are targeted most frequently. The tool showed that billions of pieces of information were being collected every single month, and it also showed that several billion pieces were being taken from citizens of the United States. This was despite the fact that the NSA had specifically stated to Congress that it did not gather data on millions of American citizens and didn’t even have the capacity to do so. XKeyScore Allows The NSA To Track Anyone’s Online Activity “You could read anyone’s email in the world, anybody you’ve got an email address for. Any website: You can watch traffic to and from it. Any computer that an individual sits at: You can watch it. Any laptop that you’re tracking: you can follow it as it moves from place to place throughout the world. It’s a one-stop-shop for access to the NSA’s information.” That’s how Edward Snowden describes the power of XKeyScore , which is perhaps the most powerful NSA internet espionage tool of them all. Also known as XKS, this computer system is designed to search through and analyze internet data from users all over the globe, and huge amounts of that data are being collected each and every day. What’s more, all of that data can then be shared with other intelligence agencies as part of the ‘ Five Eyes ‘ and ‘Fourteen Eyes’ alliances , so agencies like the GCHQ in the United Kingdom or the Defense Intelligence Headquarters of Japan could also get access to information on a person’s browsing habits, search history, and general internet usage. Fighting Back Against Internet Surveillance With so many harrowing revelations coming out of the Snowden leaks, especially in regard to internet surveillance through systems like XKeyScore, many people want to take action to be safer online and keep their data private. That’s why statistics are showing a big leap in the number of people making use of virtual private networks (VPNs). VPN providers like ExpressVPN and NordVPN are essentially able to encrypt your internet connections and hide your presence online, meaning that even if attempts were made to track your activity, they wouldn’t be successful. Other VPNs Worth Checking Out: Torguard CyberGhost IPVanish VyprVPN Pros And Cons Of Using A VPN Pros Cons Hide your online presence and encrypt your connections for total anonymity Monthly/Annual subscription fees Stay safe from hackers and malicious software. Connection speeds can sometimes vary, depending on the VPN you choose Access region-locked or restricted content and services like Netflix Enjoy total security when traveling. The NSA Spies On Global Leaders We’ve seen that giant tech companies like Google and Apple aren’t safe from the NSA’s spy tools, and the same can be said for world leaders like presidents and prime ministers. Many documents from Snowden’s files have revealed that the NSA has targeted over 120 different global leaders over the years, spying on their communications and actually listening in on their phone conversations. Examples Of Leaders Who Have Been Hacked: The likes of former Brazilian President Dilma Roussef , former Mexican President Felipe Calderon, and current German Chancellor Angela Merkel have all been victims of the NSA’s surveillance. The NSA was even able to spy on meetings between multiple world leaders at the likes of the G8 and G20 summits. The Knock-On Effect This sort of surveillance doesn’t directly affect the average member of the general public, but the revelations have already led to rising tensions between the United States and several other countries around the world. For example, when Snowden revealed that the NSA had been spying on China , the relationship between the two countries was dealt a big blow. The NSA Actively Works Against Internet Encryption Again, we can see another scary revelation for internet users all over the world as Snowden’s leaks also revealed that the NSA had teams of agents tasked with breaking down widely-used encryption and security measures used online. A document from the GCHQ stated: “ For the past decade, NSA has led an aggressive, multi-pronged effort to break widely used internet encryption technologies… Vast amounts of encrypted internet data which have up till now been discarded are now exploitable” . This NSA program was nicknamed Bullrun and made use of different hacking tools like brute-force attacks in order to break through standard encryption systems like HTTPS and SSL, which are used all over the internet for systems like online banking and purchases. The NSA Has Its Own ‘Special Forces’ Team Of Hackers As well as having a myriad of remarkably powerful hacking tools and systems at its disposal, the NSA can also call on the services of the “ Tailored Access Operations ” team. Abbreviated to TAO, this team is made up of elite hackers who can make use of various tools (like those seen in the ANT catalog, above) in order to hack into computers with astonishing ease. With an arsenal of hacking systems and devices to choose from, the TAO team is able to break into computers regardless of whether they’re online or offline. From there, they can monitor location, internet activity, keystrokes, communications, and more, as well as infecting the device with Trojan horses and other forms of malware. Intelligence Agencies Can Even Spy On You Through Angry Birds It might sound too crazy to be true, but the reports and leaks have also stated that intelligence agencies like the NSA or the British GCHQ can actually make use of flaws in the designs of certain apps, including popular mobile games like Angry Birds , to spy on smartphone users. These apps are nicknamed ‘ leaky apps ,’ and there are millions of examples out there. Just by opening a simple game, the sort of thing that millions of people are doing every single day while riding the train to work or taking a quick coffee break, you could be providing intelligence agencies with personal data like your age, sex, name, email address, and even your current location. How Does It Happen? Many popular apps require access to your personal information to provide full access to their full functionality. For example, social media integration, sharing scores in games, or playing with friends online. Unfortunately, the majority of these apps are not made by experts in security, so it is easy for intelligence agencies or any malicious hacker to exploit holes and retrieve your information. The extent to which intelligence agencies can use apps to obtain information about a user isn’t fully clear, but it is believed that as well as basic info and current location, agents could also use apps to learn about your political alignment, sexual orientation, income, marital status, education level, and more!

Moreover, the price of Solana (SOL) has exhibited superior performance compared to prominent cryptocurrencies, experiencing a notable increase of more than 34% in value over the course of one week. Solana is a widely recognized Layer-1 network renowned for its scalability. The Solana network is characterized by its rapid confirmation times and has a thriving ecology and community. Over the course of the previous 24-hour period, there has been a notable increase of 15% in the trading volume of the SOL cryptocurrency, accompanied by a positive trend in its price.

Subsequently, the coin underwent a decline in value, leading to a breach of its support level by the price. The SOL price had a significant gain of 25% throughout the preceding 30-day period. At the time of writing, the market capitalization of the altcoin stands at $9,740,214,861. Based on the Solana price forecast, financial analysts see a potential increase to $31 by the end of 2023.

One key factor is the Solana ecosystem’s rapid expansion and advancement, especially in the field of decentralized finance (DeFi). SOL market cap currently at $12.5 billion.
