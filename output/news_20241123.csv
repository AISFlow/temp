In particular, the altcoins have responded quite positively to the election of pro-crypto candidate Donald Trump as the next US President. Related Reading: Wyckoff Cycle Shows Where We Are In The Market And When Altcoin Season Will Begin XRP, ADA, TON, Others Stand Out Amidst Bullish Altcoins Performance In its weekly report on November 22, blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant reported that several altcoins have experienced large price spikes after the US Presidential election on November 5. The analytics firm reports that daily spot trading volume in the altcoin market reached $18 billion on November 11, the highest since early August, indicating an increased market interest in these tokens. CryptoQuant explains that these positive developments in the altcoin market hinges on general expectations of a friendly regulatory approach by US President-elect Donald Trump who continuously declared intentions to support the digital asset industry during his electoral campaign. In particular, CryptoQuant highlights XRP as one of the best-performing assets since the US Presidential elections. The sixth largest cryptocurrency has risen by 154% to $1.45 in the past two weeks, which has coincided with a record-high DEX volume of $3.5 million on the XRPL network. Aside from XRP, Tron (TRX) has also grabbed market attention reaching a new all-time high of 10 million daily transaction count as USDT supply on the blockchain network moved above the $60 billion mark. TRX has gained by 25% since November 5 rising to $0.20. Furthermore, Toncoin (TON) has experienced a market rebound rising by 27% since the elections to reach a local peak of $5.75. Importantly, Toncoin maintains a high network activity as evidenced by its 1 million daily active addresses compared to the 60,000 recorded at the start of 2024. Other altcoins in CryptoQuant’s report include Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) which have gained by 62.42% and 206.06%, respectively since Donald Trump’s electoral victory.

Meme coins are experiencing a resurgence, and at the forefront are Dogen and two other notable tokens. Their sudden popularity is capturing the attention of investors globally. This piece delves into how these cryptocurrencies are potentially set to ignite the next big meme frenzy in the digital currency sphere. DOGEN Rejoys Big Moment: Trump’s Victory Will Send It to the Moon Guess who is going to join Elon Musk’s moon mission soon? DOGEN, the boldest meme coin for alpha males, is gearing up for take-off as Trump's victory in the recent US election has the entire market euphoric about the prospects of cryptocurrencies, especially meme coins. Donald and Elon are Best Buddies for Meme Coins Donald Trump’s love for crypto is no secret — he’s promised to make the U.S. the global crypto leader in his campaign. And joining him is none other than Elon Musk, the ultimate Dogecoin (DOGE) fan who’s backed the crypto movement and even aligned with Republicans earlier this year. With these two icons fueling the fire, meme coins are set for a wild ride! DOGE Soars 130% in Just One Week! DOGEN will be the Next Star with 500% Surge Following the US election results, Dogecoin (DOGE) has been on a steady rise: from $0.15 to $0.39 in just one week. DOGEN follows the same upward trend, starting at $0.0003 and now trading at $0.0007, a staggering 133% leap. With a total of 13 presale stages, DOGEN is set to rise to $0.0019 by the token generation event (TGE), which represents a 500% increase from its initial price. Like it DOGE style?

Live the high life you deserve: luxury cars, stacks of cash, and unforgettable experiences await those who go all-in on DOGEN. Don’t settle for ordinary when you can have it all! Flex Hard, Earn Big – DOGEN is Your Power Move! Dogecoin: From Meme Coin to Influential Cryptocurrency Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency launched in 2013 as a playful alternative to traditional coins. It features a Shiba Inu dog from an internet meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin has no maximum supply, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute. In 2021, its value surged, placing it among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap. This rise was fueled by social media and endorsements from figures like Elon Musk. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer as a joke, Dogecoin gained popularity due to its strong community. Its abundant supply and active supporters make it unique. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin continues to draw interest, highlighting its potential in the crypto world. Shiba Inu (SHIB): An Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Growing Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a memecoin inspired by Dogecoin but operates on the Ethereum blockchain, enhancing its compatibility within the Ethereum ecosystem. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous developer Ryoshi, SHIB began with one quadrillion tokens, half of which were sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin. Buterin donated a significant portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, raising SHIB's profile. SHIB's integration with Ethereum allows for projects like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and future developments like an NFT platform and DAO-based governance. These features could enhance its utility in the crypto space, potentially making it attractive in the current market cycle. Conclusion Although DOGE and SHIB may have less short-term potential, DOGEN stands out as a token designed for those who embody luxury and success. With expected 700% growth by the end of its presale and potential for massive returns this altcoin season, DOGEN follows the path of successful tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat. It is building a community of leaders and offers real benefits, including exclusive perks for early adopters.

Retail interest is also increasing, with a 2.10% increase in new addresses and a 1.09% gain in daily active users. Chainlink is trending on social media, according to Santiment’s research, with its sentiment and weight metrics showing a 0.28% jump. Investors are talking, and the chatter is fueling LINK’s upward march. LINK Price Action Presently, at a price of $16.94, Chainlink is up by 11% in the last 24 hours, getting ready to take the next leap and break above the $17.12 resistance barrier. Analysts believe that if this surpasses the specified barrier, the path to $30 will become more likely. Some predict that continued momentum may facilitate a retest of LINK’s all-time high of $52.88, achieved in May 2021. The cryptocurrency market as a whole is experiencing a bullish November, with Bitcoin remaining above $98,000. This broader confidence is boosting Chainlink’s potential, but it still needs to catch up to prior highs. #Chainlink🔗 is attempting to break the multi-year resistance.

Over the last two weeks, the prominent altcoin has recorded a 154% price gain establishing itself as the sixth-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $89.82 billion. With this current momentum and the crypto bull season still in its early stages, analysts remain highly bullish on XRP’s potential to reach lofty price levels. Related Reading: XRP Primed For $100 Price Target – Here’s Why Can XRP Repeat 2017 Historical Price Movement? In an X post on November 22, an analyst with the username CryptoBull stated that XRP could trade at $40 over the next three months if the token mirrors its first prominent price surge from 2017. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that XRP rose $0.006 to a market peak of $0.33 in early 2017, representing a 5,400% gain. Considering its recent price rally, the altcoin may be gathering momentum to reproduce such price movement in a highly anticipated crypto bull run, especially considering recent happenings. Most notably, popular anti-crypto Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler recently announced his intentions to resign on January 20, a move largely behind the current bullish sentiment among XRP investors considering the Commission’s long-lasting regulatory battle with Ripple. In fact, Gensler’s decision to leave the SEC has been described as the “best thing” for Ripple, which holds significant weight for XRP’s future. Gensler’s resignation coincides with the inauguration of pro-crypto incoming US President-Elect Donald Trump who has promised to introduce a more friendly approach to digital asset regulation in the US. Aside from XRP finally being free from the regulatory scrutiny of the SEC, the potential introduction of a spot ETF under Trump’s pro-crypto regime also contributes to bullish sentiments on the altcoin’s profitability. According to CryptoBull, if XRP follows its price explosion from early 2017, the token is expected to hit a price target of $1.96 in November, $6.30 in December, and $40 in January. Related Reading: XRP Binance Inflows Spike: What It Means For Price Price Resistance Levels In XRP’s Dream Surge While XRP presents much potential for a high price target, CryptoBull predicts the token to face significant resistance at the $1.96 price region. If buying pressure proves sufficient to move past this level, the analyst expects XRP to confront another resistance at $3.84 which represents the token’s current all-time high price. Considering the current robust bullish sentiments in the market, the altcoin is likely to move past these highlighted resistance levels. However, the token’s Relative Strength Index remains far in the overbought zone (91.73) indicating significant potential for a price pullback. At the time of writing, XRP continues to trade at $1.78 reflecting a 79.57% gain in the past week. Meanwhile, the token’s daily trading volume is up by 103.57% and valued at $20.29 billion.

The world's largest cryptocurrency has quickly cemented its place as one of the most prominent ""Trump trades"" following the former U.S. President's election victory on November 5. Trump embraced the crypto during his election campaign and became the first-ever major U.S. party nominee to accept donations in bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and other cryptocurrencies. The President-elect in July said he wanted to turn the U.S. into the ""crypto capital of the planet and the bitcoin superpower of the world."" He also said he would hold the cryptocurrency in a strategic national stockpile if re-elected. Also see: SA Sentiment: Should the U.S. create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve? High-profile crypto investor Mike Novogratz, the founder and chief executive of Galaxy Digital, this week said bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) hitting $100K was ""almost inevitable ."" Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and cryptocurrencies in general also received a shot in the arm this week after U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair Gary Gensler said he'll step down in January. Gensler has been known for his adversarial stances with Wall Street and crypto. ""Gensler's resignation marks a new chapter at the SEC – one where neutral regulators are driven by the law and not ideological politics. On November 5, the American people delivered a clear pro-crypto mandate,"" non-profit organization Cedar Innovation Foundation said in a statement on Thursday. ""The next SEC chair, the new Congress, and the new administration have an historic opportunity to enact responsible regulation that ensures American global leadership and creates good jobs at home instead of driving them overseas, all while protecting and empowering consumers. It’s time to act,"" the Foundation added. Bitcoin was last down 1.6% to $97,701.94 in afternoon trade. It reached as high as $99,772.99 on Friday.

Over the last few days, the big question on everyone’s mind has been — when will the premier cryptocurrency surpass the $100,000 level? While most investors are worried about a short-term target, some market participants are more concerned about the long-term prospects of the world’s largest cryptocurrency. According to the latest on-chain data, it appears that the price of Bitcoin could see a shakeout sooner than expected. Will The Rising Bullish Sentiment Sustain The Rally? According to market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, the Bitcoin funding rates have witnessed a notable upswing in recent days. The relevant indicator here is the “funding rate” metric, which tracks the periodic fee exchanged between traders in the derivatives (perpetual futures) market. Related Reading: Cardano Gains Steam: ADA Sights More Growth After Breaking $0.8119 When the funding rate is high or positive, it implies that the long traders are paying traders with short positions. Typically, this direction of the periodic payment suggests a strong bullish sentiment in the market. On the other hand, a negative value of the funding rate metric means that investors with short positions are paying traders with buy positions in the derivatives market. This trend suggests that the market is shrouded by a bearish sentiment. Data from IntoTheBlock shows that the Bitcoin funding fees for perpetual swaps have increased by more than 10% — and up to 20% on major trading platforms. However, the on-chain firm noted that this continuous funding rate growth could hint at speculative overheating, potentially resulting in market corrections. According to IntoTheBlock, one of the possible catalysts of this bullish sentiment is the United States government’s approach to crypto under Donald Trump. With the “strategic Bitcoin reserves” more of a possibility under the incoming US president, investors are banking on Bitcoin surpassing a six-figure valuation. As of this writing, the flagship cryptocurrency is valued at around $98,400, reflecting a 1% increase in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin Perpetual Futures Market Remains Restrained — What It Means In a recent post on the X platform, Glassnode revealed that the Bitcoin perpetual futures market “remains restrained.” This suggests that several traders are still approaching the market with caution despite the steady price climb of BTC in recent weeks. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Set To Skyrocket By Saturday, Warns Crypto Analyst Data from Glassnode shows that the Bitcoin funding rates are just above 0.01%, which falls short of the March 2024 level (~0.07%) when the BTC price reached a local top. Ultimately, this suggests that there is still room for growth in the value of the premier cryptocurrency.

A CryptoQuant analyst known as Amr Taha detailed these developments in a post on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform. The analysis focused on substantial outflows from the exchange to cold wallets, highlighting potential implications for market sentiment and liquidity. Related Reading: Ethereum Sees Neutral Netflow On Binance: What Does This Signal? ETH Netflows On Deribit And The Implications According to Taha, the Deribit Options Exchange recorded a notable transaction involving 233,000 ETH transferred to a cold wallet. Valued at approximately $783 million, the transaction was executed at an average price of $3,350 per Ethereum. This was not limited to Ethereum alone—Bitcoin also witnessed a similar outflow, with 31,000 BTC worth $3.038 billion moved to cold storage. These transfers have sparked speculation about the motivations behind such activity and their potential impact on the broader market. As a result, the CryptoQuant analyst highlighted four major implications of this movement. First, the reduction in selling pressure is notable. Assets stored in cold wallets are less likely to be sold immediately, which can decrease liquidity on exchanges. Taha noted that this scenario may contribute to price stability or even further boost the bullish trend in the market if demand remains steady or increases. Another key takeaway from these transactions is the possibility of institutional accumulation. Such large-scale transfers often indicate that institutional investors or high-net-worth individuals are confident in Ethereum’s long-term value. Furthermore, Taha highlighted Deribit’s strategy of moving these funds as part of a risk management approach. The analyst wrote: Moving assets to cold storage is a security practice to minimize exposure to hacking risks. It also reflects a cautious approach, likely due to regulatory scrutiny or anticipated market volatility. Additionally, Taha highlighted that this move could also have impact on market sentiment where by traders could interpret these transactions as bullish, “leading to increased buying activity.” Ethereum Market Performance Meanwhile, Ethereum currently trades above the $3,300 mark following an increase of 8.2% in the past week and 1.3% in the past 24 hours. The asset’s market cap has also significantly surged alongside its price with a current valuation nearing $400 billion. According to renowned crypto analyst known as EᴛʜᴇʀNᴀꜱʏᴏɴᴀL on X, Ethereum current price chart appears to be mirroring that of 2016-2017 where it experienced a “mega bull” run.

The benchmark S&P 500 ( SP500 ) saw gains in four out of five sessions and ended the week 1.7% higher, marking a reversal from the retreat last week. Wall Street saw a bit of a tumble earlier in the week after Ukraine struck Russia with U.S. missiles. Investors were also focused on focus on U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's nominations for his upcoming administration, a rally in bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) that brought it closer to the $100K mark and AI giant Nvidia’s ( NVDA ) latest quarterly results. Amid these developments, the trending stocks of the week included: MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) was up around 22% in the week, buoyed by bullish crypto sentiment stemming from Donald Trump’s presidential election win. The shares, which have jumped 85% since the Election Day, were unfazed even after Andrew Left’s Citron Research said in a post on X that it’s betting against the software company. Alphabet ( GOOGL ) was in spotlight, after the U.S. Justice Department proposed major changes to search engine Google, including a forced sale of its Chrome web browser. Speculation had grown recently that the DOJ might push for splitting off the browser. Shares dipped 5% over the week, after a late Wednesday filing confirmed the department was seeking the remedy after Google was found to have operated an illegal monopoly in search and search ads in a landmark antitrust trial. Spirit Airlines ( OTC:SAVEQ ) filed for bankruptcy protection after incurring years of losses. The beleaguered budget air carrier has commenced a voluntary prearranged bankruptcy proceeding with a debt restructuring agreement already signed by a majority of its bondholders. The airline expects to complete the Chapter 11 process in the first quarter of 2025. Nvidia ( NVDA ) reported its fiscal third-quarter results and guidance that topped expectations, highlighting its dominance in the artificial intelligence spending boom. The chipmaker confirmed that Blackwell production is in full swing, with demand expected to exceed supply for several quarters in fiscal 2026. Walmart ( WMT ) shares gained 6% following stronger-than-expected Q3 results and upward revisions to its FY2024 guidance. Super Micro Computer ( SMCI ) shares rebounded 65% this week after the company hired a new auditor and filed a plan to come into compliance with Nasdaq listing requirements. Snowflake ( SNOW ) rose 33% after the cloud data storage and analytics company reported positive Q3 results and outlook. The company also announced an acquisition and a new partnership with AI startup Anthropic. ZIM Integrated Shipping Services ( ZIM ) fell 11% even as the company declared a $3.65 a share special dividend, lifted full-year earnings guidance and reported a healthy third quarter. The container liner shipping company said revenue more than doubled from a year earlier to $2.77B in the quarter, beating the average estimate of $2.41B among Wall Street analysts. The company swung to a profit of $1.13B from a loss of $2.27B a year earlier. Zeta Global Holdings ( ZETA ) rose 21% after the company announced plans for company executives and board members to purchase around $3M of its stock. The marketing tech firm also released what it is calling a ""detailed"" rebuttal in response to the short report from investment firm Culpert Research earlier this month. Target ( TGT ) slumped 19% after the retailer reported Q3 results and revised its full-year earnings outlook, both falling short of Wall expectations. Tesla ( TSLA ) rose after reports that members of President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team are seeking to ease federal framework for fully self-driving vehicles.

The agency initiated 583 cases this year, a 26% drop compared to 2023, but landmark penalties like the Terraform Labs case propelled the total to unprecedented levels. A $4.5 billion judgment against Terraform Labs accounted for 56% of the SEC's total penalties. This case stemmed from the 2022 collapse of Terra/Luna, which destabilized the crypto market and caused massive investor losses. The SEC found Terraform Labs and its CEO, Do Kwon, guilty of defrauding investors, making it the largest monetary penalty in the SEC's history. The agency described it as one of the most significant securities fraud cases ever. Other notable cases included a settlement with Silvergate Capital , a bank linked to crypto firms like FTX , for misleading compliance-related disclosures. Additionally, BarnBridge DAO faced charges for not registering its structured crypto assets as securities. The SEC also emphasized its efforts to protect investors. This year, $345 million was distributed to harmed investors, bringing the total to $2.7 billion since 2021. Furthermore, the SEC processed over 45,000 tips, complaints, and referrals, including 24,000 whistleblower submissions. Whistleblower awards reached $255 million, highlighting the importance of public collaboration in identifying misconduct. Outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler reaffirmed the agency's commitment to safeguarding investors and ensuring accountability. He stated that the SEC will continue to ""follow the facts and the law"" to hold violators responsible. However, critics have questioned the effectiveness of the SEC's strategy. Some argue that while hefty penalties serve as deterrents and measurable milestones, they might not address deeper systemic problems in financial markets. The 2024 fiscal year demonstrated the SEC’s aggressive stance on crypto fraud, but debate continues over whether financial penalties alone are enough to achieve lasting reforms.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | LUNA | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/sec-hits-record-8-2b-in-2024-fines-led-by-terraform-case,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36755356.jpeg

See the chart below for a roundup of the gains and losses in some selected assets: Things to be gleaned from the chart: U.S. outperformance continues with Wall Street marching higher. Meanwhile, European and Asian equities have shown weakness as traders fret over Trump's proposed trade policies including his promise of levying more tariffs - predictably, the Chinese indexes have fallen the most. Yields in Germany and the UK have slipped as market participants have turned to the safety of bonds. The dollar index has strengthened, as the greenback is seen to benefit from a low-tax and high-tariff environment under a second Trump administration. ""Since the U.S. election, global markets have probably reacted as you’d have expected if you were concerned about the new administration's trade policy, and if you thought U.S. exceptionalism would continue,"" Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid said on Thursday. ""Obviously, a lot of people have mentioned the 2016 playbook. But it’s worth remembering that the S&P 500 was only up +1% in the 18 months before election day 2016, so there was a lot of room to catch up after a sluggish period. By contrast in 2024, the index was up +40% in the 18 months before the election, so building on that would be historically impressive even if continued U.S. exceptionalism remains the main market take from the election so far,"" Reid added. There have been some assets that have seen an outsized advance or retreat. See the chart below: Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has quickly cemented its place as one of the most prominent ""Trump trades"" following the Republican candidate's election victory. Its advance has come after Trump embraced the crypto during his election campaign and became the first-ever major U.S. party nominee to accept donations in bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and other cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, Tesla ( NASDAQ: TSLA ) stock has soared on hopes that top boss Elon Musk's close relationship with Trump could translate into a benefit for the electric vehicle maker. Speaking of electric vehicles, stocks and exchange-traded funds tied to renewable and solar energy have come under pressure, amid worries that the Republicans would take a much harder stance towards renewable energy projects and spending than the Biden administration. Wall Street on Friday ended the week higher , helped by steady gains as the S&P 500 ( SP500 ) rebounded following a dip post the election. Here are some exchange-traded funds of interest that track the benchmark index: ( VOO ), ( IVV ), ( NYSEARCA: RSP ), ( SSO ), ( UPRO ), ( SH ), ( SDS ), and ( SPXU ).

The analyst shared a chart highlighting crucial technical indicators and price movements that suggest the cryptocurrency could be gearing up for an even higher ATH. Analyst Projects $105,000 As The Next Price Target Weslad, a TradingView analyst, has raised his Bitcoin price forecast, predicting the next upside target at $105,764 as the crypto market bull run gains momentum. The analyst reported that BTC has officially entered the bull market phase, characterized by explosive price increases and positive market sentiment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price ATH Set To Cross $139,000 According To Previous Election Cycles His recent bullish prediction of the Bitcoin price is grounded on a key technical pattern known as the “Ascending Channel,” which indicates a bullish trend continuation. This chart pattern consists of two upward-sloping trend lines drawn parallel to each other, representing the resistance and support price levels, respectively. Despite his optimistic outlook for the BTC price, Weslad has revealed that investors should anticipate a corrective move toward the immediate buy-back zone, which would provide an optimal entry point for opportunistic buyers. The analyst has also shared a detailed price chart that highlights the bullish ascending channel and key price levels that Bitcoin could reach in the short-term and long-term. Overview Of The Analyst’s Bitcoin Price Chart Analysis In his 4-hour Bitcoin chart, Weslad visualizes the cryptocurrency’s price action within an ascending channel, highlighting that the BTC is moving upwards within two trendlines. The analyst has provided a detailed roadmap for his $105,764 bullish target for the Bitcoin price. Weslad highlighted the price range between $91,000 and $92,000 as an “important demand zone,” which acts as strong support where buyers are likely to step in if BTC slips any further. He also revealed that the price level at $94,327.99 has been identified as an ”immediate buy-back zone,” which also serves as an optimal entry point if BTC experiences any corrective pullback in its price. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts 37% Upshoot For Dogecoin Price, Points Out Support Levels The analyst has also highlighted $97,537 as the “immediate profit target,” suggesting that traders may consider locking in profits at this critical short-term price level. He has also pinpointed the “mid-term target” for the Bitcoin price, highlighting that the $100,334 mid-term level is important for investors holding longer positions. Lastly, Weslad has highlighted $105,764 as the “projected final target” for Bitcoin, indicating that this may be the ultimate target for the present market cycle. For BTC to reach this bullish price target, it would require only a modest 6.83% increase from its current value. As of writing, the price of Bitcoin is trading at $99,072, marking a 12.73% increase over the past seven days, according to CoinMarketCap.

36752908,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654381,1732375824,54% Of Bitcoin Supply Inactive Since 2 Years Despite 500% Price Jump,"On-chain data shows a majority of the Bitcoin supply hasn’t moved in more than two years, despite the fact that BTC has seen a significant uplift during this period. Bitcoin Inactive Supply Trend Suggests HODLing Behavior Remains Strong In a new post on X, Glassnode co-founder Rafael has discussed about the trend in the various bands of the Bitcoin Active Supply. The “Active Supply” includes that part of the BTC circulating supply that has been involved in at least one transaction over a given timeframe. Related Reading: Bitcoin Officially In Overheated MVRV Zone, Rally End Near? Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows how the Bitcoin Active Supply has changed for a few different age bands over the last couple of years. From the graph, it’s visible that the age bands on the younger side like 1 month to 3 months and 3 months to 6 months have been observing growth recently, which suggests the relatively recent supply has been churning as a result of the price surge. The older bands, however, have been more or less showing a sideways movement on this indicator. The chart displays all the Active Supply bands up to the 1 year to 2 years group stacked on top of each other, to showcase what percentage of the total supply that they make up for. It would appear that these Active Supply bands add up to 46%, meaning that less than half of the cryptocurrency’s supply in circulation has witnessed some movement within the past couple of years. The 2-year cut off currently sits in November 2022, when the last Bitcoin bear market reached a bottom. Given the trend in the Active Supply, it seems that the investors who bought during and prior to the bottom have largely decided to HODL. Interestingly, this is despite the fact that the asset’s value has seen an uplift of more than 500% since then. “HODLing isn’t just a meme,” notes the Glassnode co-founder. Statistically, the longer investors hold onto their coins, the less likely they become to participate in selling, so considering that 54% of the supply hasn’t seen movement for over two years now, it’s possible a lot of these holders would only continue to sit tight in the near future.

MSTY's call-option-selling strategy generates strong distributions, especially with MicroStrategy Inc.'s (MSTR) high implied volatility, making it an excellent vehicle for variable monthly income. The fund's recent near-doubling of AUM, with a forward yield potentially reaching 130% amid ongoing market volatility. Upgrading MSTY from Hold to Buy due to its impressive return metrics and the likelihood of sustained high options premiums driven by high volatility. In my recent article called MSTX: Take The Risk, Make The Gains , I made a case for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) breaching $100k and heading toward two key levels. The first of these was $123k, as predicted by Binance's crowdsourced forecasting tool . That figure has significantly dropped at the time of this writing down to $99k, indicating fears that the rally of the past month won't hold. However, there's also a $200k BTC price target from Bernstein from earlier this year that's still valid, in my opinion. More so, in fact, now that we know which way the political winds driving crypto adoption and regulation are likely to blow. Regardless of the ultimate price of Bitcoin after this extremely important period in its history, there's a way to take advantage of the volatility that we're currently seeing, and one of the ideal vehicles for that is the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF ( MSTY ). Remember that $100k BTC is a powerful psychological level, so why not use the opportunity to maximize your gains on the back of the volatility that it is causing? Besides, since my last article on MSTY in May 2024, the total return has been an incredible 90%, with the price return at a mere 4%, so the distributions seem to be really attractive. I believe it'll only get better because of the call-option-selling strategy that the ETF uses works really well when the underlying is volatile, which I discuss in the next section of the article. To be clear, that's not to say that MSTX has poor returns, but that ETF is not designed as a long-term holding; it's a daily 2x leverage play, where you need to carefully time your entry and exit points. Both use derivatives to achieve leverage, but MSTY focuses more on generating distributable cash, unlike MSTX, which tends to deliver stronger results on the price front, and for much shorter holding periods not exceeding a few days at a time, at the most. MSTY, on the other hand, is a buy-and-hold ETF that generates outsized distributions using call-writing as its main strategy. Both ETFs can handsomely complement a core holding of MSTR, so it's also a way of hedging against downside risks, especially if your MSTR holding is a significant portion of your portfolio. Why Call Option Selling is an Excellent Volatility Play The base assumption for my updated thesis on MSTY is that selling calls on a rising stock - the underlying stock being MicroStrategy Inc. ( MSTR ) - is an enticing way to generate income. Let's be clear that such income is never stable, and you'll see that variance in the monthly payouts . This is not a strategy for fixed income investors. YieldMax ETFs That being said, it's an excellent strategy for generating a variable monthly income, and the strategy becomes even more effective when the underlying security is facing volatility - and MSTR is certainly volatile right now, if nothing else. Market Chameleon calculates that MSTR's ""current IV (226.5) is 78.9% above its 20 day moving average (126.6) indicating implied volatility is trending higher "" and that ""implied volatility (226.5) is currently 117.3% above the 252 day HV (104.2) mean."" This kind of volatility, which MSTR has seldom seen, presents a ripe opportunity for selling calls. In MSTY's case, these are represented by November and December 2024 calls at strikes ranging from 610 to 890. The synthetic long position was created using a collar with Feb 2025 call and put contracts at a strike of 315, which both caps the upside as well as increases the likelihood of the put contracts expiring worthless. Regardless, the premiums generated on the sold calls have been very strong due to the increased volatility of the underlying. I believe that will remain the status quo until we have more clarity on the direction of Bitcoin and where Trump's presidency will lead it, so that gives investors a lead time of at least a couple of months that should hypothetically see BTC-USD rally further or go into a temporary consolidation phase, which I touch on later. The challenge now is the psychological barrier of $100k, but that challenge is also an advantage as far as this strategy is concerned, because the 180-day implied volatility of BTC-USD is currently above 60% , which we haven't seen since about September 2024. BTC-USD IV - The Block This higher-than-normal volatility is positively influencing the premiums that MSTY can get for underwriting these contracts, which is likely why we're seeing higher distributions right now. I don't see a problem for them to stay at these levels while the high volatility persists. From a forward yield perspective, Seeking Alpha data shows about 60%, but that only assumes an average monthly payout of a little over $2. The last two payouts, however, were both above $4, so on the optimistic side, using that as the run rate translates to a forward yield of 130%. Not too shabby. Closing Thoughts Data by YCharts As you can see, the fund has nearly doubled its AUM in the past couple of months alone, indicating strong investors interest. That's among the many buy signals thrown off by this ETF, not to mention the extraordinary distributions. The last time I wrote about MSTY was in May 2024, when it had an extrapolated forward yield of just 19%. Today, that figure is at 130%, and it's not unreasonable to expect this to continue. The fact that a crypto-friendly president is taking the oath in two months gives me confidence that options premiums will remain elevated. Of note is that we may have already entered a consolidation phase, which I suspect will be short-lived. TradingView One particular indicator needs some attention here: the SOPR or Spent Output Profit Ratio. SOPR is simply a measure of whether total BTC transactions on the last day was at a profit or at a loss. Anything above 1 means investors collectively transacted BTC at a profit, which could be a sign of profit-taking. BGeometrics However, it seems like longer-term BTC holders, as indicated by the LTH-SOPR ("" Long Term Hodler SOPR ""), are not cashing out as aggressively as earlier this month, when BTC breached $90k for the first (and second) time. That's a definite bullish sign that they expect another rally from here, presumably once a breakout is established over $100k BTC. The overall SOPR indicator at a slightly elevated 1.2 shows that some profit is definitely being taken off the table, but it's more pronounced among longer-term holders. Or hodlers, if you prefer. It's open to interpretation, of course, but these indicators tell me that a lot of profit has been taken off the table at $90k BTC, but that the market is now getting ready for a significant move up. MSTY's 0.99% expense ratio looked a little expensive to me when I first wrote about the ETF, but now that we have more data on the return metrics, I think it's very reasonable. As such, I'm upgrading my rating from Hold to Buy.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4739826-msty-leverage-the-volatility-as-btc-usd-prepares-to-breach-100k-upgrading-to-buy?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36752066.jpeg

Today, the cryptocurrency rose over 20% to break above the $0.90 mark, fueling a bullish sentiment for the long-awaited $1 target. Related Reading: Ethereum Attempts Key Breakout: Analysts Set Next Target As ETH Reclaims $3,200 Cardano Makes New Year-High Above $0.90 On Friday, Cardano broke past the $0.81 resistance and skyrocketed toward the $0.90 mark, making a new year-high of $0.97. This performance represents a 22% surge in the last 24 hours, driving the token to its highest price since late April 2022. Cardano peaked above the $3.10 mark three years ago but lost its bullish momentum as the crypto market struggled, hitting its lowest price of $0.22 in June 2023. Since dropping 92% below its all-time high (ATH), ADA has been heavily criticized for underperforming the rest of the market. Nonetheless, the cryptocurrency recovered during Q1 2024 highs, reaching the $0.81 mark before losing 66% of its gains in the next few months. The recent market rally has seen ADA outperform most altcoins in the last three weeks, renewing interest in the cryptocurrency. According to CoinGlass’ data, Cardano’s open interest (OI) surged by 28.25% in the past 24 hours, hitting $855.5 million today. Additionally, it has jumped over 11% in the past four hours, suggesting increased activity and confidence among crypto traders. ADA To Hit $1 Soon? Cardano investors and crypto analysts have recently expressed their bullishness over ADA’s “fire” performance. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that Cardano has surged over 200% this month, fueled by whales and institutional investors. Per the post, the volume of large ADA transactions on the network had increased by over 297% since the US election, reaching $22 billion on November 19. Martinez signaled that these large transactions are related to high accumulation levels, as whales holding $1 million to $10 million in ADA increased their positions by over 100% in the last 30 days. He also highlighted that ADA seems to be mirroring its 2020-2021 price action. As reported by NewsBTC, the analyst has suggested the cryptocurrency is set to experience a 2,000% run toward the $6 mark if it continues to follow its past behavior. Related Reading: Crypto Community’s Revenge: Solana Memecoin Rug-Pulled By Gen Z Trader Hits $80 Million Market Cap As the price soared past $0.90, Martinez pointed out that the $0.80 resistance, where 48,000 addresses had bought 1.2 billion ADA, was a “key area of support to watch for the bullish thesis to hold.” Analyst Sebastian highlighted that, after the $0.80 resistance, “there isn’t much resistance until $1.2.” As such, ADA could potentially see “an explosion from here” and target the long-awaited $1 mark over the weekend. As of this writing, ADA is trading at $0.97, a 46% increase in the last seven days.

36747580,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654407,1732365040,"Dogecoin Price Chart Flashes Clean Bull Flag At $0.38, Here’s The Next Target","The Dogecoin price has recently exhibited a classic bull flag pattern on its price chart, a technical indicator often signaling continued upward momentum. The Dogecoin price has mostly traded below $0.4 in the past seven days on the back of a continued price consolidation. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.39, sitting firmly within the consolidation phase of this bull flag pattern. KrissPax Identifies Key Target For Dogecoin Price This development of a bull flag pattern was highlighted on the social media platform X by crypto analyst KrissPax, which relays to the current bullish sentiment surrounding the DOGE price. Particularly, this bull flag pattern was highlighted on the 2-hour candlestick chart of the Dogecoin price. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts 37% Upshoot For Dogecoin Price, Points Out Support Levels A bull flag pattern is characterized by a sharp price increase (the flagpole) followed by a period of consolidation in a downward-sloping channel (the flag). This formation suggests that, upon breaking above the upper trendline of the flag, the asset may resume its prior uptrend. In the case of the DOGE price, the flag pole was created by the Dogecoin price rally from November 8 until it peaked at $0.446. Since then, a consolidation has led to the creation of a flag. As KrissPax noted, a successful breakout to the upside would push the DOGE price toward $0.60. Interestingly, the analyst expects this breakout to happen by Friday. Clean bull flag on the Dogecoin chart – target $0.60. Could we see the start of the next $DOGE breakout on Friday? Meanwhile, Dogecoin still trading right in the middle of the flag at 38 cents. pic.twitter.com/kR6WSxMQI5 — KrissPax (@krisspax) November 22, 2024 Market Expectations For DOGE’s Next Move At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.393. A move towards the $0.6 mark would translate to a price increase of about 53% from the current price. Furthermore, reaching the $0.6 price target would put the Dogecoin price at a new 2024 high and a three-year high, but still about 22% from its current all-time high of $0.7326. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price ATH Set To Cross $139,000 According To Previous Election Cycles KrissPax’s $0.6 price target plays into a bullish outlook of the DOGE price among many crypto analysts and traders. Supporting this bullish outlook, other analysts have observed similar patterns. For instance, a report from Bitcoinist noted that the Dogecoin price could rally to its all-time high of $0.73, paving the way for a surge to the much-anticipated $1 level. Furthermore, other analysts have predicted that the DOGE price could reach $2 by the end of the year at the current pace of price growth. This bullish outlook for the Dogecoin price cuts across every part of the Dogecoin ecosystem. On-chain data has shown that Dogecoin whales are taking advantage of the price decline to load up on their holdings. Particularly, Dogecoin whale addresses holding 10 million to 100 million DOGE tokens have bought more than 550 million DOGE over the past week, worth around $214.5 million.

Scheduled to debut on December 2, these options will be based on the Cboe Bitcoin ETF Index, which tracks a selection of US-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. What This Means For Traders The introduction of these options follows closely on the heels of Nasdaq’s recent listing of spot Bitcoin ETF options. This move allows US investors to utilize derivatives to speculate on or hedge against BTC’s price movements. Related Reading: XRP Price Outlook Brightens: Expert Predicts $2 Target Post-Gensler Era Alex Thorn, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital, emphasized that reducing Bitcoin’s volatility could significantly alter investor perceptions. The availability of cash-settled options will provide institutions with effective tools to hedge their positions, potentially increasing overall market liquidity. This influx of options trading could also influence retail trading behavior, especially during bullish market conditions. Notably, the current surge in Bitcoin’s price, which reached an all-time high of $99,300, has been partly attributed to increased trading activity and market optimism. Therefore, introducing cash-settled options could further push Bitcoin over the $100,000 mark, especially given the increased buying pressure seen in recent days. Cboe’s options on the Bitcoin ETF Index will also enable market participants to gain exposure to spot Bitcoin ETFs and, by extension, to Bitcoin itself. The cash-settled nature of these options is said to simplify the process, as positions will be resolved in cash at expiration. Additionally, the options will feature a “European-style exercise,” meaning they can only be exercised on the expiration date, thus minimizing the risks associated with early assignment. Cboe Mini Bitcoin ETF Options In conjunction with the standard-sized index options, Cboe plans to launch Cboe Mini Bitcoin ETF Index options (Ticker: MBTX), valued at one-tenth the notional value of the standard options. Moreover, Cboe will also offer cash-settled FLEX options on both the standard and mini index options. FLEX options enable traders to customize key contract terms such as exercise price, exercise style, and expiration date, providing further flexibility in trading strategies and allowing for larger positions than typically permitted with standard options contracts. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Set To Skyrocket By Saturday, Warns Crypto Analyst Rob Hocking, Cboe’s Global Head of Product Innovation, highlighted the benefits of cash settlement and the variety of index sizes available, which are expected to attract institutional and retail participants looking to hedge or capitalize on Bitcoin’s price movements without directly holding the asset. The exchange already lists cash-settled Bitcoin and Ether margin futures on Cboe Digital Exchange, with plans to transition these products to the Cboe Futures Exchange in the first half of 2025, pending regulatory approval.

My bearish stance on the Grayscale Solana Trust contrasts with my bullish view on the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund due to its discount to NAV. The Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust also trades at a large discount to NAV, but I'm skeptical about buying it despite that discount. Usage of the Ethereum Classic blockchain has seen continued erosion of the last 10 months. It's a ghost town blockchain. In my view, there's no real reason to expect a positive catalyst from here that helps close the discount rate in ETCG. I've generally been very bullish of digital assets and crypto-proxy assets during the majority of 2024. There have been a few exceptions to that bullishness, however, with Grayscale funds that trade at large premiums being an area where I've recommended caution. My recent coverage of the Grayscale Solana Trust (GSOL) is a good example of one of my bearish takes. On the other hand, I've been bullish on the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund ( OTCQX:GDLC ) due to the large discount to net asset value. There is one Grayscale product that bucks the general trend from the company's offerings; like GDLC, the Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust ( OTC:ETCG ) trades at a large discount to net asset value as well, but I'm much less convinced that buying the fund on any discount closing is a good idea. I last covered ETCG for Seeking Alpha in January and held a bearish viewpoint. At that time, Ethereum Classic ( ETC-USD ) developers were gearing for the ""Spiral"" upgrade, and I had several concerns about the preparedness in the market. Today, we'll go over how the network has performed since that upgrade and get into some of the shareholder information pertaining to ETCG specifically. Ethereum Classic Network Data The point of the network upgrade back in January was to make Ethereum Classic more EVM-ready in the event that something happened to the Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) network. So far, Ethereum is plugging along just fine and scaling quite well via L2 networks. For Ethereum Classic, there hasn't been any real surge in applications or Total Value Locked on the blockchain: Ethereum Classic TVL in ETC (DefiLlama) DefiLlama shows the ETC-denominated TVL on the blockchain at just 20.5k ETC, or a USD value of a little over a half million dollars. This is well off the December high of $1.7 million and indicative of a blockchain that has had virtually no dapp growth whatsoever since Spiral. It doesn't get much better when looking at the raw user numbers: 30 Day Average DAA (CoinMetrics) The 30-day rolling average of daily active addresses fell below 12k in October. This level of users is still slightly above the all-time lows late 2020, but well off the highs from 2021. The same is true for transferred value on the chain: 30 Day Average Transferred Value (CoinMetrics) While it has actually grown a little bit here in November, USD-denominated transferred value averaged less than $10 million for nearly the entire months of September and October. That figure spent most of January between $40-50 million per day before the Spiral upgrade. Finally, it isn't a network data point, but one of optics: ETC Blog The ETC Blog that has been active since 2015 by various writers and regularly maintained by Donald McIntyre since late 2022 hasn't been updated since August. The same is true for the Ethereum Classic YouTube page. The point is, there is very little activity or enthusiasm for Ethereum Classic as a blockchain network. Thus, the gas token associated with the chain lacks any sort of organic bid or bullish catalyst from where I sit. Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust Despite Ethereum Classic seemingly becoming a ghost town of a blockchain, ETCG remains one of the top single asset Grayscale funds by AUM at $305 million: Grayscale Funds by AUM (CoinGlass) This is unusual because ETC has a much smaller market capitalization than other cryptocurrencies in this screengrab, like Litecoin ( LTC-USD ) or Bitcoin Cash ( BCH-USD ). And unlike every other non-ETF single-asset fund offered by Grayscale, ETCG is the only fund that trades at a considerable discount to net asset value. As of 11/21 close, that discount stood at over 42%. There's a good reason for this, in my view, and it's related party holdings. Genesis Assets (Genesis Global Holdco, LLC) In my past ETCG work for Seeking Alpha, I've noted the high related party ownership in the fund relative to other funds. There are just under 14 million ETCG shares outstanding. Of those shares, related parties owned over 3 million as recently as Q3-23. As of Q3-24, that figure is down to just 15k shares. The reported related party figure from the latest ETCG 10-Q no longer includes shares held by Genesis. Genesis notoriously went bankrupt as a result of third-party insolvencies from Crypto Winter in 2022. In February, Genesis was given court approval to sell off the trust assets at its own discretion and without a timeline. Though it appears as though the trust assets have been sold off based on both industry reports and court documents . Still, ETCG trades at nearly half the market value of the ETC underlying the fund. Closing Thoughts I don't see a real catalyst that reverses this discount. Unlike some of the other discounted crypto-proxy funds that track with assets that have strong networks and user bases, Ethereum Classic just doesn't have the level of activity that, I believe, would make the coin itself necessary to acquire. Without an organic bid on ETC for gas usage as a utility coin, there's little reason to be bullish ETC and by extension ETCG. Stranger things have happened in this market, and ETCG's NAV discount could certainly close back near NAV. Especially considering the Genesis liquidation overhang is seemingly in the rearview mirror. But I think there are better ways to double your money in this market than betting on a discount window closing in a fund that offers exposure to a blockchain network that has very little activity and no clear catalyst. I'm still going to call this one an avoid.",NEGATIVE,BCH | ETC,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | ETC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4739786-etcg-discounted-for-a-reason?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36744735.jpeg

Cardano recently surged past the psychological $1 price mark , hitting a multi-year high on Friday. ADA's upsurge placed it among the top gainers in high-caliber cryptocurrencies, outperforming every other crypto asset in the top ten rankings.Meanwhile, Cardano's price is not the only metric that received a boost, as its rating also got upgraded. Crypto rating firm Weiss Crypto announced on November 22 that Cardano had attained a new ranking following the project's solid performance.Cardano Joins the ""A"" Crypto Asset Class According to Weiss Crypto, Cardano has joined an exclusive digital asset class occupied only by the two leading cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum. The rating firm upgraded Cardano from a ""B+"" asset to ""A-"" following its solid market performance.Notably, Weiss Crypto marks the ""A"" class as an excellent crypto asset, as the group's occupants tick major market criteria. The firm ranks Cardano as an ""A"" asset because it marks excellence in adoption, technology, and overall market performance.However, Cardano's excellent classification ranks in the lower third of the letter grade. The A rank has an ""A+,"" ""A,"" and ""A-,"" and Cardano occupies the lowest grade.Meanwhile, Ethereum ranks in the same grade as Cardano , with Bitcoin's rating trumping both. The pioneering crypto asset has an ""A"" tag, with Weiss Crypto attaching a ""strong buy"" recommendation to its label.Cardano's Growing Adoption Prompts UpgradeNotably, Cardano's upgrade was expected following recent developments in its ecosystem. For context, the Cardano ecosystem partnered with BitcoinOS to unlock smart contract features on the Bitcoin network.The relationship would also bridge liquidity to the Cardano chain, allowing access to Bitcoin's over $1.9 trillion market cap. Bitcoin developers could also deploy decentralized applications on their chain and pay transaction fees with BTC.Furthermore, the prospect of founder Charles Hoskinson's involvement with creating US crypto policy and the traction it brings to the Cardano ecosystem has drawn institutional adoption to the chain.Other Assets RankingsMeanwhile, notable assets like Solana , Dogecoin , and XRP rank highly on the Weiss Crypto rating. For instance, Solana has a ""B+"" badge, accruing a B in technology and adoption but an ""A+"" in market performance.XRP has a ""B"" grade tag, getting a ""B"" in technology and a ""B+"" in market price performance.

36742759,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654028,1732355839,Proof of Censorship,"Here you have a Greek tragedy of a downward spiral in art, culminating in a work being sold by a horse-era institution, propped up by 100 years of destructive philosophy, confirmed shadow games since the 1940s, recent inflationary money printing, and blatant one-sided activism. It’s worth stepping back to see the big picture. A shiny new web3 house on the hill then asks new-era artists to conform to the old setting by becoming vehicles to sell even worse garbage, while leaving out the OGs of the scene—ensuring the products can’t outshine the primary idiocracy… or so it might seem at first. Maybe there is more to it all. Something even those directly involved are not even considering to be a thing. This “full circle” above refers to how seemingly progressive ideas are actually about selling the future in a desperate attempt to save the past, and control the present. Much like printing money at the expense of future generations, the fiat era of money is still in full swing in art. The Great Contemporary Art Bubble was a revelation when I first saw it at the start of my career in art in 2008. This article offers an alternative perspective to the popular banana show recently dominating the web3 art internet. It’s a big “what if”? If you can be truthful, brave, and funny—say, in the spirit of Joe Rogan—you might get some things wrong, but this article has plenty most have never considered to be a part of the art world. My intent is to be as fair as possible, and to continue saving art from the last hundred years of agendas that no longer serve it, especially in today’s world where decentralisation tools can invite everyone excluded into the party-this being nearly the whole population of the earth right now. Setting the stage: First off, SuperRare has done a great service to the digital art community in impressive numbers of art sold, and development in the scene through their DAO, keeping the creator resale royalties under pressure, and fighting for the scene to become a thing among the first in the game. Watch this interview by the founders to get a deep dive into their perspective on the Dinis Guarda show. Thousands of artists will likely speak positively about the whole thing. So what gives? In short, the corporate mindset leading art, once again. This is not about SuperRare alone, but the whole company scene that emerged, and something that is personal to me about it all as well. As per the selected fifteen bananas, the dilemma of SuperRare is obvious. You can’t outshine the lame duck pre-internet paradigm banana, and the bureaucratic class, so their curator team is stuck choosing the upper end of what can be politically business wise tolerated. That ends up being not much, while they sell the future down the polluted river. “A tragedy is a literary, theatrical, or dramatic work that typically depicts the downfall of a central character, often due to a combination of their own flaws (such as hubris, greed, or ambition) and external forces (such as fate, societal pressures, or the actions of others). Tragedy is characterized by serious themes and often evokes feelings of pity and fear in the audience, culminating in catharsis—a purging or emotional release.” Or actually just.. (Art) Threat To Our Bureaucracy The SuperRare competition held in sync with Sotheby’s upcoming auction of a famous banana marked a new low in substance for the NFT scene, and there’s plenty to reflect on from before. Not because the art was the worst—that standard is impossible to set in NFTs anymore—but because of the combination of pleasing an old player while simultaneously sidelining the OGs – for the sake of engagement farming and money. The essence of crypto art—the rugged band of true avant-garde artists who took on the central banking system—has now been mostly washed away from sight. Events like this banana show, where they could have shone brightly to the world, instead pushed them further into the shadows. The watering down the Vodka of this scene is now an equivalent of a frozen bottle in the freezer. The more partnerships formed with pre-internet and web2 companies in hopes of “reputational gain,” the more a promising beginning started to vanish before our eyes. Very soon, the scene began to resemble the old one the pioneers had been trying to escape. The clearer the communication challenging the status quo in the art world at large, the more certain you became of hearing, “You weren’t selected this time,”, if you heard anything at all in the web3 scene as well. The curatorial team is hidden, so the community can only fight a symbol like SR, while those responsible for the heat generated remain protected. “I’m afraid I can’t explain myself, sir. Because I am not myself, you see?” ― Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland Is art free? If art is truly free, where are the visual artist equivalents of Jordan Peterson, Thomas Sowell, Eric & Bret Weinstein, Gad Saad, Camille Paglia, Joe Rogan, Jonathan Haidt, Graham Hancock, Patrick Bet-David, Coleman Hughes, Yeonmi Park, Casey & Calley Means, Christina Hoff Sommers, Michael Malice, Mike Baker, Matt Taibbi, Matt Walsh, Tucker Carlson, Annie Jacobsen, Ben Shapiro, Candace Owens, Andrew Huberman, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, and an abundance of others? This list includes credentialed academics, surgeons, scientists, religious and non-religious figures, journalists, people from the left and the right, as well as outside the system. Regardless of what you think of them, together they reach billions of people across various platforms and tackle a vast ocean of topics that are absent from the art world. Many even more provocative voices are deliberately excluded from the list, highlighting just how low the tolerance for dissenting to the postmodern monolith viewpoints is. So, are we living in the most restricted era of art history, or are we just now realizing how controlled it has always been? It’s becoming increasingly clear that the culture of convenience in art has overtaken its true purpose, much like what has happened in food, medicine, media, and other fields, as illustrated by the podcast guest list above. It didn’t take long that web3 went down the same stream. This article, links and all, might just be able to change your whole perception on what art is today. You will, however, need some courage and sincerity to get it. As I’ve recently discussed, including in this Anna Fischer interview, the art world’s cancellation and selection processes are deeply intertwined with lesser-known histories and fishy agendas also. These include the interference of intelligence agencies like the CIA since the 1940s, working alongside a specific kind of ideological possession—arguably making art less free than even the corporate scene is now substance wise. We’ve just had it for so long that people don’t understand being completely captured by a singular philosophy of postmodernism. You can read my previous “Free web3” article to get clued up on that side if unfamiliar. The past to shine light to our current state: Through declassified documents, investigative journalism and biographies related to the Congress for Cultural Freedom (CCF), a CIA-funded organization, revealed that the agency had funded Jackson Pollock, Rotko, and De Kooning. The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) played a pivotal role in the CIA’s cultural strategy. Key figures like Nelson Rockefeller (a MoMA trustee) were complicit in promoting Abstract Expressionism as a symbol of American freedom. MoMA organized exhibitions that were covertly funded by CIA-backed organizations, ensuring Abstract Expressionism gained prominence internationally to combat soviet art propaganda. Jackson Pollock in his studio in 1951 Wait a minute, VESA—are you insinuating that SuperRare or Sotheby’s are somehow influenced or captured by an intelligence agency? In short, no not directly, nor do I have any evidence otherwise. Direct involvement is not how these agencies work anymore. Most people would never know if they were behind something. However, it’s impossible to claim they haven’t been influenced indirectly, given what we know about the past For better or worse, we’ve all been influenced by these forces. The question is, did CIA leave the space after the 50’s, which is unlikely, and how many other agencies have entered, and from which countries since? Undoubtedly this is part of how we’ve arrived at where we are today, and I’ll unpack that as best I can below. A scene from 1740’s London Sotheby’s was founded in 1744 and has long been one of the rubber stamps of perceived quality. Much like the media, they underwent a strange transformation during COVID, embracing their metaverse and digital assets phase. It was as if, suddenly, serving Big Mac-level artworks in a three Michelin-star restaurant was considered cool. To me, it felt like they were burning down their own house and hosing it with petrol to speed up the process. A similar trend emerged with SuperRare, which increasingly alienated itself from its origins, throwing out OGs like Robness and Max Osiris. These were contrarians, for sure, but contrarians have always been a crucial part of the game. They fought for freedom of expression—annoying to the founders, perhaps—but they were powerful in their expression and represented the core of what this scene was supposed to be about. In essence, they weren’t doing anything Duchamp, Pollock, or even Basquiat wouldn’t have done. I say this, having endured a few unprovoked tirades from Max myself, but keep being on his side. If you are against free speech, you are anti-art The talented rarely align with corporate agendas over art. While I was courteous to the early scene people involved, I was merciless in my expression of what this scene was truly about. You can find that in pieces like “Selling banks their fat asses back” or “The Br8ve“. The corportes had clenched assholes just by knowing I existed, especially after taking a freedom of speech stance during Covid. Many platforms didn’t accept my applications in web3, so kudos for SuperRare for keeping me. I said I was going to be fair. The free speech alone was enough to get me sidelined to the tune of tens of millions so far. Freedom of speech of course is another way of saying freedom of expression aka art. The artists with the greatest potential and the most original expressions found themselves relegated to the outskirts of the pump. Meanwhile, what thrived were imitations of previously made masterworks, done to death concepts from decades back, meaningless glitch art, and whatever iteration of abstract impressionism was f l y i n g. I had some cool ones too along those veins, but crickets. Seemed everyone and their uncles were on Sotheby’s and Christie’s – but not me. Artnome soon deleted this post after seeing mine. To share some of the load, this was going on for me ever since the beginning. Artnome was among the first three people I contacted in 2017, and he took an active role in making sure I was nowhere to be found in his curation or circle. I contacted him directly, so there is little doubt. Everyone in the early scene was aware of everyone else. Can only imagine what kind of things he has said behind closed DMs. To me, Artnome represents crypto art much like Flint Dibble represents archeology. Many from the early scene felt the same. Not mentioning names as I am not in the habit of throwing people under a bus, nor were they shy to say so either. The personal responsibility part Back in the day in 2017, when there were very few of us crypto artists indeed, it was the SuperRare guys who reached out to me to join their platform. It was my relative mistake back then to join Four Park and Orion Vault instead, as my ten-year efforts could be priced at $50K there, while SR was averaging $50 per piece in 2017 and 2018. My works were heavy effort and just making one was 5x more expensive than what I could have gotten out of them in SR. Also the quality of the works was some cool stuff but mostly kids throwing shit on a wall and seeing what sticks with a glitch effect. By glitch effect I am not talking about cool stuff like Xcopy or A.L Grego later, but truly amateurish “wtf is this?” stuff. I thought I’ve actually exhibited in reputable galleries and received major press coverage reaching hundreds of millions. Joining this could look bad for me on many levels. VESA and CTO of SuperRare Jonathan Perkins at the Museum of the Future in Dubai in 2022. My bad, of course, since I sold nothing through the former two and was priced out of reach for the SR crowd at the start. The bear market and non-existent high level collector base wiped out both Four Park and Orion Vault. It wasn’t long, that things looked different on SR, and I did hop on board already in 2019, which I thought was early enough, but then nearly nothing happened no matter what price or kind of work I uploaded. I thought it very strange, as there was things flying off the digital shelves for more money and less, objectively deserving it much less on the basis of story, aesthetics, CV, reach, process & critical acclaim. Primarily, art matters, and that didn’t suck. So,again, wtf? The works were being sold for crazy money consistently by others. You could basically literally put out a line of colour and be an artist that started that year, and sell. It was the boom of 2021. Somehow, this was not the case for me in NFTs, despite being here and very visible almost before anyone else. “The Beginning of a new era” artwork by VESA, a digital original from 2013 made with a Bollywood star, reaching about 300m people when published. The Shiny New Web3 Art House On The Hill SuperRare quickly became a standard for collectors, most of whom, for the most part, had little understanding of art. The founders had backgrounds in architecture and new media but lacked direct experience in fine art. It was a degen scene—focused on crypto symbols and positive decentralization propaganda—which soon escalated into pure speculative hype over anything and everything available. There was some sophistication, too. Expertise was then soon imported from the legacy scene, which ended up being the problem. For the most part, collectors sought the curatorial stamp rather than the substance, career, or depth of the art itself. However, there were exceptions—artists who truly embodied those qualities. Meanwhile, platforms like Rarible, OpenSea, and others turned into a digital Wild West on fire. I’m using Joseph Desire-Court’s 1826 “Delusion scene” artwork as a meme to help people understand my relationship with SuperRare since the early days to now. It is deeply personal, as well as funny, as my real son was stillborn during the time I realised I was going to be left behind from the movement in 2021. Losing my son, as well as simultaneous access to the first NFT run, was a tough pill to swallow back then. I’m not suggesting this whole situation with NFTs is SR’s fault, but they seemed to have played a part in my deboosting—despite them being well aware of me. In the coming banana show part, I got confirmation of this, as all the founders were tagged in my post & the accompanying text leaves little for imagination for the curators. It’s proof of censorship. Painting by Joseph Desiree-Court meme alteration – 1826 to 2024 “In the biblical book of Genesis God flooded the earth, sparing only Noah and his family who had been instructed to build an ark. All others perished in the great deluge. Instead of illustrating the life of Noah, Court gives us a scene from the other side of the story. Here a man has to choose between saving his own son or his father. He chooses his father who, despite the man’s efforts, has just slipped out of his grasp. The painting can be read as an allegory about clinging to the past. If you always look to traditions and the past, you will miss out on all the possibilities that the future can bring.” End Stage Postmodernism During the NFT boom, the Pride LGBTQ+ movement also reached a stratospheric rise, and overnight, Fewocious became its brightest star. While I think he is a talented artist, his work was clearly youthful; a 16-year-old simply hasn’t had the time to develop much depth yet. His pieces sometimes depicted crying, misunderstood figures with a similar text explanation—if you know what I mean. The cartoonish style of this young artist was soon hailed as Basquiat-esque, with the added elements of gender confusion and being on the spectrum. Altogether, it fit every “tick-a-box” criterion for the emerging ETH scene, that was enhanced by media, marches and organisations. There was a heavy government, media and colliding corporate push for this that came out of seemingly nowhere all of a sudden. During the NFT run, the Bitcoin culture and the rest of the chains truly separated. It was all WAGMI and “Gm” for the scene—except, of course, for many of the artists who had fled the increasingly absurd woke art world and formed the first wave of crypto art by critiquing central banking, money printing, and promoting hard money principles. We were interested in healing society from a very different set of lenses, and not all that convinced more woke was what we needed to go into the right direction. On top of that, if you dared say a word about the “fresh wave” of end stage postmodernism, you weren’t necessarily cancelled silently, but certainly considered “out”. I’m Potency No one likes critique it feels ick, but without it the whole world becomes no rizz. I haven’t really participated in an ‘art submission competition,’ perhaps ever, as I’m a bit old-school and view it much like Prince might have viewed the rise of TV singing contests. He felt the process and commerce of it killed authenticity in the artist, and wasn’t wrong. In comparison to the music roster we had until about 2000, we live in a post music world now. However, the endless corruption symbolised by the duct-taped banana artwork, colliding with a SR competition, prompted me to enter. “In I’m-Potency, artist VESA presents a sharp satire on Western society’s spiritual flaccidity. By replacing Adam’s reaching finger with a limp, taped banana—a nod to Maurizio Cattelan’s Comedian—this piece reflects the decay of a culture that once held itself as a beacon of enlightenment but has now veered into absurdity. Michelangelo’s Adam famously reaches toward God with a finger that isn’t fully extended, symbolizing humanity’s hesitation and the delicate gift of free will. In this reimagining, Adam’s once-restrained reach becomes even more compromised, transformed into a limp banana pointing downward. It’s as if Western culture, once brimming with creative potential, is now resigned to existential apathy, unable or unwilling to reach for anything beyond itself.” That is just the start of the text ending in this: The post tagged the new head of digital assets in Sotheby’s, the auction house, as well as SR. Read the full context of the submission substance here See the selected, eventually 15 artworks considered more worthy by the SR curation team Of course, it was not selected. The most amazing thing about my submission piece “I’m Potency” not selected to the SR banana competition finals was that I am an actually censored artist, making a case on how art has been censored by the postmodernists for over a hundred years, writing the whole thing out crystal clear, but I got censored again out of the show by those who were meant to build the free infrastructure. What we have here, is an illusion of choice. A combination of a totalitarian philosophy, coupled with an illusion of options. This is made obvious by the objectively much less substance or vision pieces selected over mine with a topic of censorship. More on this a bit later, but you will see it at the very least, vindicates my point that shadow games beyond merit and substance are going on inside of the web3 art world, much like in the legacy art as well. Pissing on traditional values for a hundred years In the art world, the war on conservatism began over a century ago with Duchamp’s satire and shock artwork, The Fountain (1917). Duchamp claimed his six-dollar urinal entry piece singled how “art has lost all of its credibility.” Ironically, it sank art even lower from a certain perspective. Fast-forward a hundred years to The Comedian and it seems no amount of bubble gum in the form of “substance” can satiate the post-MTV generations. If something had already been done with far more punch a century ago, eroding standards in a meaningful way at the time, then today’s attempts are pure LARPing. Sotheby’s, in this context, is not worthy of the reverence it once commanded—especially when their head of digital assets, Michael Bouhanna, calls The Comedian “the most significant work of the 21st century.” Very little of course about this is about art, as most of it is money, power and potentially continued societal agency subversion. Jonathan Haidt’s research on disgust sensitivity is fascinating. He discovered that conservatives have a much more heightened sense of disgust when boundaries are broken, as well as a greater need for physical cleanliness. In contrast, this is not a high priority for liberals or libertarians. Naturally, those with no boundaries are easier to subvert for whatever cause. Fobia means An intense, irrational fear or aversion to a specific object, situation, or activity that is often disproportionate to the actual danger posed. This is not the same as disgust, which is an emotional response of strong aversion or revulsion to something perceived as unpleasant, offensive, or morally unacceptable. This part is less discussed in this context. “KISS” My second inspired banana, which I did not submit to the contest. So returning to the Pollock paradigm and how he was a darling of the alphabet agencies, with the CIA entering the art world as far back as the 1940s to combat the rise of communism. Leftist artists were propped up to showcase American exceptionalism. Selling the idea of a cocaine-laced drink and “do what you feel like” freedom to American youth and elites wasn’t a hard pitch compared to glorifying Soviet despots who demanded hard work as well as to be elevated to Godlike status. Read the full context of the “Kiss” artwork Most know of course the famous Kiss by Gustav Klimt, and how combining the CIA logo and the idiot banana in this context is at least a chuckle, if not a profound question mark on the last 80 years of our understanding of art. This isn’t conspiracy theory—it’s conspiracy fact. It’s also worth noting that the term “conspiracy theorist” was invented by the CIA as a derogatory label to discredit those questioning their activities, a tactic that gained traction after the JFK assassination. This will be relevant later when discussing how RFK has now been elected as part of the new U.S. cabinet. Conspiracy theories have been around pre-internet, took the internet by storm, and are completely invisible to the art world. This is because there is no right wing thought in the space what so ever. Sure there is cooky thing from flat earth to what ever, but there are legitimate conspiracies proven true that are fascinating. There are no gallery artworks making any waves? Not a single openly conservative artist anyone knows? Seems natural. Some of you might also be familiar with the famous interviews of Yuri Bezmenov, the defected KGB spy, who outlined how demoralization was part of their plan to take down the U.S. government. If you ask me, the demoralization he described has only ramped up since the 1980s, fueled by postmodern values and the fiat-funded war on conservative ideals and God—or whatever God represents as a symbol of natural order to be discovered rather than manipulated into existence. His “useful idiot” term helps us see many players in art in a different light. Eric Weinstein gives some indication with his Kayfabe concept to where we might be today. Here are parts 2 & 3 Home of DAF The art world, which has been playing with our collective subconscious for a 100 years, is in deep need of an audit by a character like Elon Musk with his DOGE crew of Vivek, RFK and Trump. Wouldn’t that be something? You also need me on Rogan going a three hour round to talk about this all. This is why I made the Department of Artistic Freedom. It’s an open invitation to the first 100 builders resonating with this idea, and available on Ador for 369k sats- a nod to Tesla. Buy it if you want to support the cause like that, but I care mostly that the mentality spreads. You don’t have to join to start making the new direction happen. Just choose to do your own exploration without censoring yourself constantly. It will be a think tank for liberty minded artists, and the function will first be to come to the aid of artists who are being ignored despite obvious merit and substance, as well as facing some form of cancellation for BS reasons. Given the massive push by governments, media, and activists for the LGBT+ community not long ago, how can we be certain that the art aspect wasn’t a similar operation to the one carried out with Jackson Pollock back in the day? Be so free that no boundary of physical reality can hold you back. Simultaneously, everyone raising their voice will be canceled, and most will be incentivized to stay quiet. I’m not saying it was—I’m saying that, knowing all we now know, we can’t be sure. And those involved publicly might not have any idea this was the case. Least of all Fewocious, so crytal clear, I am not accusing Fewo, SupeRare, nor Sotheby’s of anything. This is about something much bigger and the sum of the parts. Beeple’s “Cross Road” sold for 6.6M at Sothebys earlier $17 Million Realized in Sotheby’s First NFT Sale with Digital Creator Pak Postmodern pump: The same question certainly applies to Pak, Beeple, and many others who used late-stage postmodernism expressions as their vehicle of communication. Much was fitting to the agenda of end stage postmodernism in NFTs. From the Twitter files, we know for a fact that deboosting and amplifying messages were actively managed, and merit was certainly not at the top of the food chain in the selection process. The real question seemed to be: What can we push and get away with? This approach fit the degen agenda perfectly. It is difficult to sell high level art to an audience that can’t read it. This has been the argument of culture critic Camille Paglia. Again, I am not accusing any artist, gallery or auction house. This is mere opinion and speculation on big philosophy waves as well as the continued erosion of substance in art. In podcasting, this kind of speculation has been normal for a long time, but not in art, for some reason. Also, this has nothing to do with hating any group within postmodernism. It has everything to do with the manipulative individuals working behind the scenes to activate and suppress ideas according to power plays and political agendas. People like James Lindsay have committed significant parts of their lives to try to figure this all out. Some will accuse me of being jealous of other people’s success. While I certainly feel that more financial success would help, if finances were my first priority, this would not have consistently been my focus—to save art from postmodernism—for seven years publicly now. Otherwise, we have continued regress as progress, and a world in general, in inverse mode. When any artist does well, I’m genuinely happy for them. Artists aren’t usually known for achieving major success, as megastardom has often required aligning with various agendas rather than relying solely on the strength of the art itself to reach stratospheric heights. We can’t fix any of this unless it’s at least discussed. How differently does this all make us view what was going on before, as well as what might be going on now? The dignified bananas. Here are also some other entries that I figured were worthy of attention. Some not submitted to the competition, as understandably people with dignity don’t submit work to be evaluated by clowns, and they have been increasingly disappointed by the quality of curation since the early days. My post started with how I don’t do this, and unleashed as much fire as I can toward the whole system, stress testing it to see if I was correct – and it absolutely turned out to be the case. Banana Zone by Norman Harman Norman Harman is one of the most interesting voices in web3. To me, the consumerist era has been gone for 20 years already, but his critique of the bureaucratic class with his new series, as well as an avalanche of dirty little bitch slaps to the auction champagne crew, has been a breath of fresh air in the scene. The new AI motion work is dope too. Both capture perfectly the orgiastic degeneracy scene of this auction vibe. Norman, like many other OGs, wouldn’t “submit” work to a contest like this anymore, having been disillusioned from the scene already many times over. “RARE In The Machine” by Spaced Painter Spaced Painter did her literal submission with this piece, in which the banana fucks her into oblivion, and she metaphorically gives up due to being sidelined and ignored. That makes her Rare. It was visionary, as her being left out of the ten selected, gave her exactly that. The piece illustrates well on how the demoralising effect of 100 years of postmodernism is having on the spiritually minded, and just anyone with common sense anymore, and it is so obvious that we can make super predictive art about it. ROBNESS – I AM BANANA The “I Am Banana” by Robness is a parody take of Kevin Abosch’s I Am a Coin project already from 2019 minted on Superrare. How can you go lower than the banana? Well just put tape on tape and watch the yellow paint dry. At least that’s my interpretation. The competition set up by another crypto art enfant terrible, Maxis Osiris, has put together a parody auction competition to parody the parody auction competition parodying the parody auction. Alotta Money would be proud. Like Alan Watts said earlier that academia and religion has become but a foot note on a foot note, the direct experience is “access denied”, so the Farisejan and the money changers can keep doing their thing. “I’ll die on this lid” by Max Osiris We had a nice convo with my friend Nicolaas on all the of above and more on Bitcoin LIVE, but I wasn’t yet unfortunately aware of the selected bananas then. What ever last remaining hopium I had for the early stage platforms died the next day, hence I got motivated to write this article. Artist extraordinaire ANDRÉS DEL VECCHIO curated a much better selection of bananas from the litter on his X, so leaving that here for you to evaluate in case you don’t have time to go thought the 1100 entries yourself. It took a child to point to the nude emperor that he had been conned. In art, it has lasted a hundred years. The measure of intelligence is the ability to change. – Albert Einstein They are laughing at us. Our creative generative power. We need to understand this. While an Einstein quote is a tough one to do without seeming pretentious, in the above context it works. If you work with truth, even the setbacks help you rise. We need to stop focusing on the fall. Artists are creators, and we are currently being completely under served by trying to be under the thumb of the destroyers. This is all the postmodernists can do, and by doing garbage bananas, you are submitting to being reduced further and further. Start building the future. Make your own gallery. Band together. Don’t submit to the bureaucrats that run the establishment. We are artists. We are powerful. it’s cool. Old things and people die. Let them. As you can tell, there has been a lot of wtf going on here. Remember, I was building this, this and this, as well as speaking on big stages when everything flies off the shelves and for me nothing moved. Despite it all, find gratitude. It’s a lifeline. There is plenty to be grateful for, but step out of harms way. Remember why you got into this in the first place. If you want to support my efforts, do consider collecting these pieces from my SR page. It’s unlikely that they will age badly. I’m happy to give the platform fee back to SR, as those guys, despite my poor sales, still airdropped me comfort tokens when SUPR was launched for being there early. There was some respect there at least still then. Unfortunately, I can’t help but wonder, in recent light, how much my art not reaching people there despite significant effort, was artificially suppressed. Maybe not at all by them, but who knows. I still have a bunch of art there that cost me a bomb to mint, so hoping all my efforts with SR and for this scene will be acknowledged at some point. Writing and researching this article took a week, and I was not paid to do it. I’m either brave and pricipled, or a complete idiot. Hard to tell which one sometimes. Bit of both, I guess.

36741820,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654462,1732354204,Chinese Court Declares Personal Crypto Ownership Legal In Mainland China,"Bitcoin and crypto ownership in China have been debated and have raised policy questions for years. But a recent Shanghai court ruling clarified that it’s perfectly legal for citizens to hold, buy, and sell Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: XRP Gains Momentum: Whale Activity Points To $15 Breakthrough Judge Sun Jie of the Shangai Songjiang People’s Court explained in an article via WeChat that it’s not illegal for Chinese citizens to hold cryptos, even though the courts have already ruled that business entities are not allowed to keep, buy, or sell cryptocurrencies at will. Jie’s insights were part of a case review on a lawsuit involving two companies in an initial coin offering that’s illegal in the country. Coin Offerings Remain Illegal Judge Sun Jie’s comments were part of a case review involving two companies engaged with digital assets in 2017. According to records, an agricultural company expressed its intention to finance a digital asset. It then worked with an investment company to draft its whitepaper and issue the tokens. A Shanghai court has released an opinion stating that the personal ownership of cryptocurrencies is not against Chinese law, offering explicit legal clarity for crypto holders on the mainland amid a record-setting bitcoinprice surge.

After drafting the token’s whitepaper, the investment company was paid 300,000 Yuan for its services. Under this premise, the agricultural company expected that the investment firm would release the tokens. It was the start of a misunderstanding, leading the company to seek a full refund. Planned Token Financing And Release Is ‘Potentially Illegal’ In Judge Jie’s notes, the planned financing and release of these tokens are potentially illegal. The planned initial coin offering falls under unlawful public financing. The court has ruled that no organization or individual can illegally finance or issue digital assets. The complaint of the agricultural company is deemed invalid by the court since the planned financing and token release would have been illegal. Still, the court instructed the investment firm to reimburse 250,000 yuan after careful evaluation.

However, she explained that the Chinese government imposes strict restrictions because of the risks involved. However, the rules on cryptocurrencies change in business since crypto use can impact the financial and economic order. Judge Sun Jie says these are the primary reasons why Chinese laws impose strict rules on the use of cryptocurrencies. China first banned initial coin offerings and closed online crypto exchanges in 2017. The authorities continued their campaign against crypto in 2021 and even banned mining and other cryptocurrency-related businesses.

Today, XRP is trading at $1.57 after advancing further by 13% in the last 24 hours, solidifying its position in the $1 price range. Notably, XRP even reached a high of $1.62 today amid its bull frenzy that peaked on Friday. As the frenzy cools off, XRP has settled in the $1.50 range.Notably, just on Thursday, XRP traded at $1.0821, which implies the asset has grown by 49.71% in under two days. With XRP approaching the $2 range, analysts believe XRP may never have reasons to retest below $1.XRP Will Not Trade Below $1 AnymoreAmong the market commentators voicing this bold view is “The Bearable Bull,” a widely followed millionaire mentor on X (formerly Twitter). “We will never see XRP go below $1 again,” he declared in a recent tweet.Other market commentators expressed a similar view, noting that XRP’s position in the $1 range is now reinforced. However, some cautioned that the bold prediction might be too early, as a major correction could send XRP's price below $1.Notably, XRP broke into the $1 range for the first time in three years on November 16, 2024, and traded as high as $1.267 that day.However, a pullback ensued, with XRP correcting those gains. Yet, the asset did not lose the $1 range but came dangerously close when it hit a low of $1.0055 on November 17. Since then, XRP has rebounded massively, and the asset is now showing strong signs of continuing its upward momentum.Other Bold Market Predictions for XRPOptimism about where XRP is headed is high in the crypto community. According to John Deaton, an attorney known for his pro-XRP stance, XRP is poised to reclaim a $100 billion market cap, noting that times have changed and the days of XRP's unimpressive performance are over.Similarly, analyst “CrediBULL” has predicted that XRP will break its all-time high sooner than expected. He even boldly stated that XRP will surpass expectations and outperform Bitcoin and Ethereum.XRP boasts a 90-day growth of 127%, outpacing Bitcoin’s 53% and Ethereum’s 22%. While XRP is still 60% below its peak, Bitcoin is trading at an all-time high, and Ethereum is down 30% from its peak.

36741576,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=102601,1732351698,Expert Predicts Timeline for XRP to Rise from $5 to $30,"A market expert has predicted a possible timeline for XRP to reach $5 and rise from there to $30, citing past price movements. XRP’s recent price action has reignited optimism about its prospects. A week after reclaiming the $1 price territory for the first time in nearly three years, XRP has surged further. The token now has its eyes set on the $2 region, as it currently changes hands at $1.55 amid a 59% gain in a week.Can XRP Close November Above $2?In his latest market commentary , analyst CryptoBull stressed the importance of XRP claiming $2 and closing November above it. For context, this price would mark a near 7-year high, as XRP previously saw $2 in January 2018. XRP’s attempt to breach $2 met resistance at the $1.96 mark.However, some believe the $1.96 region could yield this bull run amid a favorable regulatory atmosphere and greater capital injection. According to CryptoBull, if XRP reclaims $2 and closes November above it, this would represent a 288% monthly increase, XRP’s highest monthly gain in seven years.Notably, at the current price of $1.55, XRP is already up 203% this month. A monthly close above $2 , marking a 288% increase, would be reminiscent of the asset’s price movement in March 2017, when it broke out during the 2017 bull run. For context, XRP surged from $0.0056 to $0.0214 in March 2017, a 284% monthly rise.Timeline for XRP Upside to $5 and $30CryptoBull believes if XRP repeats this increase with a close above $2 this month, the price action could suggest it is mirroring the 2017 bull run . Interestingly, the 2017 bull run presented massive gains following the bullish March performance, as XRP rallied by an additional 15,367% to $3.31 by January 2018.If it follows this path, more gains could be on the horizon. CryptoBull predicts that if the trend continues, XRP could more than double its price in December, eventually closing the month at the $5 price. This would mark a new all-time high.Meanwhile, CryptoBull sees XRP reaching a higher upside target after claiming a new ATH of $5 by the end of December 2024. According to the analyst, the altcoin could push further to a two-digit price of $30 by the end of January 2025. XRP Price Predictions CryptoBull XRP Price Predictions | CryptoBull The $30 price would mark a substantial 1,835% increase from the current $1.55 value, still substantially lower than the 15,367% gain XRP secured in 2017. However, this $30 price would take XRP’s market cap to $1.7 trillion, slightly lower than Bitcoin’s $1.9 trillion valuation.

Cardano broke above $1 on Friday as bullish momentum reached astronomical levels. The asset has not slowed down yet, surging further to $1.14 before consolidating at $1.09 at the time of writing.Notably, Cardano is up 25% in the past 24 hours and a staggering 213% from its price 30 days ago. According to analyst Ali Martinez, the preposterous uptick is a glimpse of Cardano’s ultimate bullish target.Something Huge on Cardano’s HorizonMartinez insisted that Cardano is still in the early stages of its targeted explosion. In a Friday X thread , he cited bullish on-chain metrics as his basis for his assertion.First, the analyst pointed to a growing whale and institutional accumulation of Cardano as a sign that something explosive is coming for the asset. Martinez’s analysis shows that the large transaction volume on the Cardano network has surged past $22 billion daily.He further indicated that the impressive daily transactions on Cardano were actually accumulations other than sales or fund relocation. The analyst deduced his claims from the uptick in whales holding between 1 million and 10 million ADA, who have topped by stash by 100% in the past month.Meanwhile, Martinez noted that bullish on-chain activities have started exerting upward pressure on ADA’s price, which is evident in the recent outburst. His commentary further asserts that sustaining these bullish metrics would spur Cardano to mirror its previous bull cycle.The analyst also reiterated his earlier prediction, insisting that Cardan would hit $6 by 2025 . Notably, ADA is now 450% away from this price target and 184% from its all-time high of $3.10.Furthermore, Martinez’s analysis aligns with Cardano bull Dan Gambardello’s assertion that something huge is coming for the “Ethereum killer.” Gambardello hinted that something preposterous is imminent for Cardano, stating that although he cannot figure out what exactly, he believes whales and institutions are loading up the asset for a reason.Cardano Traction Reaches Epic LevelsMeanwhile, Santiment confirmed the growing institutional traction towards Cardano. The market intelligence firm’s recent analysis indicates that ADA’s social presence has surged to multi-month highs.Santiment’s data shows that Cardano had an astronomical social media mention and discussion rate yesterday. Notably, this is its largest social traction in 11 months, specifically since December 8, 2023. Furthermore, Santiment shares that Cardano’s market cap is now three times what it was 17 days ago following the push past $1.

Notably, the token had once fallen as low as $8 at the peak of the FTX exchange collapse and the ensuing crypto bear market. Solana Makes Historic Recovery, Eyes USDT Flippening Solana (SOL), the much-touted “Ethereum killer,” is again in the spotlight. After dominating the 2020-21 crypto bull market, the digital asset saw its value plummet after FTX’s spectacular collapse, led by Sam Bankman-Fried. However, SOL has staged an impressive comeback over the last two years. Related Reading: $4,000 Solana Price Possible As SOL Breaks Out Of Massive Cup And Handle Pattern At the time of writing, SOL is the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, with a reported market cap of over $123 billion. The layer-1 blockchain’s market cap is just $8 billion shy of overtaking stablecoin Tether’s (USDT) market cap of $130 billion. Notably, SOL needs a further 10% price appreciation to decisively increase USDT’s market cap and become the third-largest digital asset by market cap. SOL will only trail Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as the third-largest cryptocurrency. Given the token’s recent price trajectory, it won’t be surprising to see SOL surging past the leading stablecoin’s market cap before the end of the year. In the last three weeks alone, the token has experienced a remarkable 75% surge, rising from $148 on November 4 to $259 at the time of writing. While the broader crypto market has gained momentum following the victory of pro-crypto Republican US presidential candidate Donald Trump, attributing SOL’s rise solely to this would be disingenuous. Memecoin Frenzy, Increased Network Activity, ETF Potential Helped SOL SOL’s remarkable turnaround can be linked to several factors that have spurred increased network adoption. One of the most prominent contributors is the ongoing memecoin frenzy, which has emerged as a dominant narrative in the crypto market. Related Reading: Solana Memecoin Market Thrives: POPCAT Reaches New Record Price Of $1.75 Memecoins – particularly those based on the Solana blockchain – have emerged as the crypto market’s top narrative over the last year. In October alone, the total market cap of Solana-based memecoins surpassed $10 billion. This memecoin craze has also translated into heightened network activity for Solana. Between September and October, Solana saw a 42% month-over-month (MoM) increase in active addresses, amounting to approximately 123 million. Besides benefitting from the memecoin narrative, Solana has also seen increased decentralized finance (DeFi) activity throughout the year. According to DefiLlama data, Solana is home to the second-largest DeFi ecosystem in the world, with a total value locked (TVL) of $9.265 billion. In addition, there are growing prospects for a Solana-based exchange-traded fund (ETF). A recent report indicates that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is holding active talks with multiple asset managers regarding the potential launch of a new spot Solana ETF. While SOL’s achievement of a new ATH is impressive, experts believe the token still has significant growth potential. At the time of writing, SOL trades at $259, up 6.2% over the past 24 hours.

36739932,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=102594,1732347735,Pundit Shares 3 Ways to Address XRP Reserve Fee Issue as XRP Price Surge to $1.5 Raises Costs,"The recent surge in XRP’s price has led to renewed discussions within the XRP community about reducing the network’s reserve fee. This fee, currently fixed in XRP, determines the cost of opening new accounts and creating additional objects on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). As XRP’s price climbs, the dollar value of these fees rises, creating concerns among users about onboarding.Currently, the XRPL requires a reserve of 10 XRP to open a new account and an additional 2 XRP for each object created. When XRP traded for $0.50 at the start of this month, opening a new account demanded a reserve fee of $5 (10 XRP) while creating additional mandated $1 (2 XRP).However, with XRP having recently surged to the $1.50 region, opening a new account would require a reserve fee of $15, additional $10. In addition, the reserve for each object has bumped to $5. This rise has led to concerns that the high fees could deter new retail users.Community Proposes SolutionsMarket commentator Krippenreiter recently proposed three potential solutions to address the reserve fee issue. Sharing his thoughts on X, he stressed the need for a plan as XRP prices continue to rise.https://twitter.com/krippenreiter/status/1860003475880391161The first solution he proposed was Account Leasing . This system would allow users to lease XRP for reserve fees rather than locking up their own funds indefinitely. However, he acknowledged that implementing this solution would require major development and coordination, especially from RippleX developers, to refine the technical aspects and initiate community discussions. The second suggestion from Krippenreiter is a Fast Coordinated Restart of the XRPL nodes, allowing validators to propose new, lower reserve values to the network. While faster, this method would require planning to ensure the network remains operational during the process.However, according to Krippenreiter, another approach would include integrating the reserve fee adjustment into routine updates of the XRPL software, such as during the rollout of new versions. He calls this third method a Slow Coordinated Restart . Notably, this slower approach avoids disruptions but may delay relief for users facing high fees.XRP Community DiscussionsKrippenreiter revealed that his personal reserve balance in XRP is now equivalent to $50. Interesting, Eri, a prominent community member, also shared that her reserve fees had risen to $70. https://twitter.com/sentosumosaba/status/1860007192558207084This echoed Krippenreiter’s remarks, who insisted that that the current reserve system struggles to adapt dynamically to XRP’s price changes, which have become more rapid amid the ongoing bull run.In response, Mayukha Vadari, a senior software engineer at RippleX, pointed out that XRP’s recent price surge marks the fastest increase in at least three years, suggesting that stakeholders should wait for the market to stabilize before implementing drastic changes. Krippenreiter insisted that the static reserve system lacks flexibility in responding to sharp price increases . He maintained that the current system relies too heavily on manual interventions, such as node restarts.Vadari responded by pointing out that most blockchains with reserve systems face similar challenges. Notably, she explained that making reserve fees dynamic could present risks. https://twitter.com/msvadari/status/1860027322067484727For context, if the network lowers reserve requirements and then needs to raise them later, users who onboarded during the lower fee period might find their accounts locked, as their XRP balances would no longer meet the rise in reserves.",NEUTRAL,XRP,FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/23/pundit-shares-3-ways-to-address-xrp-reserve-fee-issue-as-xrp-price-surge-to-1-5-raises-costs/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pundit-shares-3-ways-to-address-xrp-reserve-fee-issue-as-xrp-price-surge-to-1-5-raises-costs,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

In an X post yesterday, MetaMask highlighted the top five most swapped tokens within its wallet over the past week. Interestingly, the list is dominated by meme-based cryptocurrencies, such as Pepe (PEPE), Dogecoin (DOGE), Shrub (SHRUB), and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Top 5 Most Swapped Tokens on MetaMask Notably, frog-themed token PEPE ranked in the top position, with DOGE ranking as the second most swapped token on MetaMask this week. Solana (SOL) secured the third position, followed by SHRUB. Additionally, Shiba Inu secured the fifth spot, ranking among the top five most swapped tokens on MetaMask. According to MetaMask, the ranking focused on users’ activity, particularly token swaps, on the Ethereum mainnet over the past week. For context, MetaMask’s swap feature allows users to initiate token swaps directly within the wallet. It was first introduced in October 2020 on MetaMask’s desktop extension. Interestingly, the team behind the wallet extended its support to mobile users a few months later. Since its launch, MetaMask has allowed users to swap tokens directly within the wallet, eliminating the need to transfer assets to and from centralized exchanges for swaps. Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Popularity Meanwhile, Shiba Inu and Dogecoin have garnered significant attention recently, as reflected in MetaMask's latest report. Their popularity soared tremendously this month following Donald Trump’s re-election as the president-elect of the United States. Consequently, DOGE and SHIB recorded huge spikes in different areas, ranging from their prices to trading volumes. At press time, Dogecoin’s price has surged 19.02% over the past day to $0.4682. Its trading volume has skyrocketed by 126.5% over the past 24 hours to a whopping $19.23 billion. Similarly, Shiba Inu broke the resistance at $0.000025 earlier today, soaring above the $0.000027 mark.

36739929,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=102589,1732346993,BitBoy Comments on SEC “Emergency Settlement” of Ripple Suit,"Ben Armstrong, aka BitBoy, recently weighed in on the growing speculation within the XRP community about the SEC ""calling an emergency settlement"" in the ongoing Ripple lawsuit. This speculation coincided with the announcement that SEC Chairman Gary Gensler will resign from his position, with his resignation set to take effect on January 20, 2025. Among the ongoing enforcement actions Gensler oversees is the Ripple lawsuit, which has just entered the appeal phase.However, some XRP community members believe the appeal could be paused or dismissed now that Gensler's departure is confirmed. BitBoy Comments on the RumorsIn a recent live video , Ben Armstrong (BitBoy) addressed the rumors. While acknowledging the speculation, he clarified that he was unsure of the claim's validity and promised to investigate further. For context, the ""emergency settlement"" speculation stems from the SEC's weekly closed-door sessions that discuss pending cases and injunctions. The SEC held one such session on November 21, the same day Gensler publicly disclosed his resignation.Notably, the rumors contributed to Friday's significant price surge in XRP . The asset rallied over 40% to reach $1.60 for the first time in three years.Former SEC Lawyer Confirms Likely Ripple Appeal DismissalMarc Fagel, a former legal representative of the SEC, also weighed in on the matter. He noted that while there have been many fabricated reports in the past about Ripple’s settlement discussions during the SEC's closed-door meetings, the latest rumor appears more credible. “The last 200 posts about SEC weekly meetings were completely made up, but this one is totally true,” Fagel said .Fagel also pointed out that if the appeal were to be dismissed—an outcome that would be historically unusual but still possible—it likely wouldn't happen until after the new SEC Chair is appointed and confirmed. This means there will likely be ample time for more false reports and speculation leading up to the January 15 brief filing, he added.https://twitter.com/Marc_Fagel/status/1859646331540935064Interestingly, Gensler’s resignation date coincides with Donald Trump's inauguration as the 47th president of the United States, scheduled for January 20, 2025.

Jim Cramer Just Endorsed Bitcoin, Calling the Asset a Winner","Skepticism emanated in the crypto community after Jim Cramer endorsed Bitcoin, dubbing the asset a winner as he encouraged investors to own it. The “Mad Money” host had kind words for the pioneering cryptocurrency in the Lightning Round section of his show , stating that he would encourage buying into Bitcoin. In a scenario widely deduced to have a converse outcome, Cramer called Bitcoin a winner.Notably, Cramer’s comments came after a Florida-based caller mentioned that he bought MicroStrategy’s stock (MSTR) in 2023, accruing an over 1,000% portfolio increment. The caller also mentioned he does not plan on selling, lauding the software firm’s co-founder, Michael Saylor.The bullish sentiment prevails despite the recent price dump the MicroStrategy stock experienced on Thursday. Notably, the price of MSTR soared from $370 to $543 in three days but eventually crashed 30% in an hour. Despite this, the stock retained a 62% gain in November and 473% rise this year.In response to the recent investor comment, Cramer argued that although MSTR is a Bitcoin player, he refers to owning Bitcoin directly. The ""Mad Money"" host then stated that “all I can tell you is own Bitcoin, that’s a winner.”Inverse Cramer in Play?Meanwhile, this high praise from the long-term Bitcoin critic did not bode well with the crypto community. Following his comments, enthusiasts pointed to the “Inverse Cramer” theory, which has accurately predicted moves in the past.Notably, the CNBC “Mad Money” host has a track record of seeing his predictions play out conversely. His blunt inverse stock and crypto predictions led to the creation of an exchange-traded fund (ETF), allowing users to bet on the opposite of the TV personality's market recommendations.As a result, investors have humorously sensed Cramer’s Bitcoin lauds as a sell signal. The general consensus believes that the current bull run might be in jeopardy following the TV presenter’s endorsement of the bullish premier asset.The Crypto Community ReactsCramer’s Bitcoin comments have tongues wagging as speculations of the asset peaking at $100,000 emerge.

36735989,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654468,1732343447,Bitcoin’s MVRV Metric Signals Market Heating Up—Here’s What Investors Should Know,"The ongoing Bitcoin bull market has sparked renewed interest in on-chain metrics to fully understand the bullish trend behind the scenes. Earlier today, Avocado Onchain, a CryptoQuant analyst, shared his perspective on Bitcoin’s market performance, focusing on the widely-used Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. This indicator is often used to assess Bitcoin’s valuation about its realized cap, which represents the aggregated value of all Bitcoin based on its last movement price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hits S2F Threshold: Should You Hold Tight Or Take Profits? What Bitcoin MVRV Metric Currently Signals According to Avocado Onchain, the MVRV ratio provides key insights into market cycles. Historically, when the MVRV ratio dips below 1, it signals a market bottom, while values above 3.7 have coincided with potential market tops. As Bitcoin approaches new all-time highs, the MVRV ratio’s behavior suggests a shift in market sentiment from skepticism to optimism. This raises critical questions about how investors should interpret these metrics during a bull cycle. The MVRV ratio, calculated by dividing Bitcoin’s market cap by its realized cap, offers insights into whether the asset is undervalued or overvalued relative to its historical averages. Avocado Onchain emphasized that the ratio might not necessarily reach 3.7 in this cycle, as seen in prior bull markets, but could still signal overvaluation at lower levels. He noted that the ratio’s peaks and troughs have shown a narrowing trend, with higher lows and lower highs. MVRV Historical Patterns Drawing from historical patterns, the CryptoQuant analyst noted: In past cycles, detailed analysis of historical charts shows that in 2017, the MVRV ratio first reached 3.7, but Bitcoin’s price didn’t peak until six months later. Similarly, in 2021, the peak followed about three months after the ratio hit 3.7. Avocado Onchain suggested that while the MVRV ratio signals “overvaluation,” it does not guarantee an imminent price peak. Instead, the ratio often lingers around the overvaluation range, reflecting ongoing bullish sentiment with price fluctuations. Related Reading: Bitcoin Officially In Overheated MVRV Zone, Rally End Near? To mitigate risks, Avocado Onchain advises against relying solely on the MVRV ratio for investment decisions. He advocates for a gradual selling strategy as the ratio rises, allowing investors to balance potential gains with reduced exposure to market corrections. The analyst particularly concluded, stating: Asset prices often enter phases of extreme overvaluation that cannot be fully explained by numerical data alone. During a bull market, it’s essential to use not only on-chain metrics but also factors like investor sentiment, macroeconomic trends, and government policies to develop a well-rounded.

Euphoria from the bull market has spilled into different ecosystems. The Cardano community is the latest to celebrate an impressive milestone after ADA officially claimed the $1 price mark yesterday for the first time since April 2022, over two years ago.Cardano Hits $1 Days After XRPNotably, Cardano reached this feat amid a massive momentum that gained steam on Nov. 15, as it eventually surpassed the $0.57 region. ADA sustained the bullish uptrend and eventually crossed $1 yesterday after starting the day at a price of $0.8219. Cardano hit a peak of $1.0440 before facing resistance. Despite the resistance, the altcoin held above the $1-mark, closing the day at $1.0175 amid an impressive 23.81% gain. This marked Cardano’s best intraday performance since Feb. 13, 2021, when it gained by a more substantial 33%. At press time, ADA has maintained the $1 level , currently trading for $1.0822.Cardano’s latest move comes on the back of a similar feat from XRP, the sixth-largest cryptocurrency. Amid a rally that began on Nov. 5 following Donald Trump’s election win, XRP officially reclaimed $1 on Nov. 16 for the first time since December 2021, nearly three years ago.Notably, the trio of XRP, Cardano and Dogecoin have been on the race to reach $1 since the start of the ongoing bull run. XRP had the upper hand, as it traded closer to the price mark than the other two tokens. ADA was poised to reach the level next, with DOGE expected to follow suit.Can Dogecoin Reach $1 with 146B Supply?This forecast has so far materialized, with XRP and Cardano already above the price target. Now, investors have turned their eyes on Dogecoin, with the meme coin now the next on track to claim the milestone.Notably, DOGE is already showing signs of another phase of rapid price surges following a period of consolidation. The meme coin confirmed its potential for growth when it rallied 177% to $0.4385 on Nov. 12, attaining this rate within eight days. Following the pullback from $0.4385 and the subsequent consolidation, DOGE has now resumed its uptrend after breaching its bull flag. The token touched a new peak of $0.48 today and then retraced to the current price of $0.4655. Analyst Ali Martinez earlier predicted a rally beyond $1 amid the latest breakout. At the current price, data confirms Dogecoin would need to rally by an additional 114.92% to reach the $1 price. Given its historical performance in the previous bull run and the potential it has demonstrated since Nov. 5, analysts believe an extra 114.92% rise is readily feasible for DOGE. Dogecoin 1D Chart Dogecoin 1D Chart However, Dogecoin would face a more substantial roadblock to $1 than Cardano and XRP. Notably, while XRP has a circulating supply of 56.9 billion tokens, and ADA at 35 billion, Dogecoin boasts a more expansive supply of 146 billion . As a result, Dogecoin would require much more capital inflow to reach $1, which would bring its market cap to $146 billion. Also, DOGE has never reached the $1 price in its history. Despite these challenges, the price mark is still within reach for the meme coin.

In a pivotal move, U.S. President-Elect Donald Trump nominated investor Scott Bessent to serve as Treasury Secretary under his administration. Bessent Profile Bessent’s nomination has been among the most anticipated over the past few days due to his market-savvy and pro-innovation approach to economic policies. His entire career has been in the finance sector, working for Jim Chanos and George Soros and running his own hedge fund, Key Square Capital Management. He is known to advocate for cautious trade policies, tax reform, and deregulation. Prior to Bessent’s nomination, other high-profile candidates, such as investors John Paulson and former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh, were among those considered to fill the position. However, the U.S. President-elect nominated Bessent for the position. Significance of Treasury Department to Crypto Bessent’s appointment has garnered significant attention in the financial market, including crypto. The Treasury Secretary nomination holds significant importance from a crypto perspective. The Treasury Department significantly influences the future of the U.S. crypto industry, determining how the sector should be regulated. Ripple CEO Reacts Following Bessent’s appointment, top crypto stakeholders have been reacting to the move, with Ripple CEO providing a hint of what the industry should expect. Garlinghouse referred to Bessent as the perfect choice for the Treasury Department. The Ripple CEO emphasized that the billionaire hedge fund manager will become the most pro-crypto and pro-innovation Treasury Secretary the industry has ever seen. This suggests that Garlinghouse believes Bessent will support favorable policies that could foster the growth of crypto. For context, Garlinghouse has been an advocate for pro-crypto regulations, actively engaging with lawmakers to promote a favorable regulatory framework. Last week, reports suggested that Garlinghouse met with Donald Trump after the election. Although he did not directly confirm the meeting during an interview on FOX Business, the Ripple CEO liked a post about it. Crypto Enthusiasts Anticipating Who Will Serve as Next SEC Chair Meanwhile, with Trump nominating Bessent for Treasury Secretary, crypto enthusiasts are closely observing who would fill the role of the SEC chair under his administration. Like the Treasury Department, the SEC also significantly influences crypto regulation, as its policy could decide the industry’s future throughout Trump’s reign as president. With Gary Gensler announcing plans to resign as SEC Chair on January 20, Trump will have to nominate a new chairperson from a list of high-profile candidates, including pro-crypto lawyer Teressa Goody Guillen and Robinhood’s CLO Dan Gallagher.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/23/ripple-ceo-reacts-as-donald-trump-nominates-billionaire-hedge-fund-manager-as-treasury-secretary/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ripple-ceo-reacts-as-donald-trump-nominates-billionaire-hedge-fund-manager-as-treasury-secretary,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

During the same time frame, $147 million has been put into Spot Ethereum ETFs. This shows that people are becoming more optimistic about the future of ETH. #Ethereum whales have bought over 430,000 $ETH in the last two weeks, worth over $1.40 billion! pic.twitter.com/n7iTTADuax — Ali (@ali_charts) November 14, 2024 The activity surge continues; trading volumes for Ethereum ETFs reached a record $1.63 billion last week, representing a 44% weekly increase. According to analysts, this increase is consistent with the patterns observed in Bitcoin ETFs, which experienced an initial period of stagnation, followed by a period of sustained growth. In response, Ethereum’s price went through the roof, rising by 25%, which was the biggest weekly gain in six months. Many people see these changes as signs that Ethereum is gaining speed, which could possibly lead to more benefits. Shifting Landscape: Layer 2 Solutions While there are positives, growth in Ethereum’s network sends out a mixed signal. New ETH addresses created are lower than those seen in previous bull markets. The reason for this is seen by experts as Layer 2 options such as Base. Because these technologies are built on top of Ethereum’s infrastructure, transfers can happen more quickly and for less money. This makes it less important to directly connect to the main Ethereum chain. Nevertheless, Ethereum’s significance has not been eclipsed by Layer 2 growth. Tokens continue to be indispensable in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT ecosystems. In reality, this expansion strengthens Ethereum’s fundamental function while simultaneously increasing its scalability and accessibility.

This latest price movement has boosted XRP’s two-week performance to a massive 170% gain.With XRP showing strong determination to break its 2021 cycle high, market analysts believe the journey to a new ATH has already begun. Among those voicing this optimistic view is “CrediBULL,” who boasts a following of 436K on X. According to CrediBULL, XRP is likely to reach a new ATH much faster than most expect.XRP to Outperform Bitcoin and EthereumFurthermore, he expressed the bold opinion that XRP will significantly outperform both Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two market leaders, from its current price levels.On short-term timeframes, XRP is outperforming both Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of price appreciation. For instance, Bitcoin is up by 55% over the past 90 days, while Ethereum has gained 21%. In contrast, XRP has surged by an impressive 94% over the same period.However, Bitcoin is trading near an all-time high of around $99K, and Ethereum is down just 32% from its peak. XRP, on the other hand, is still trading 63% below its six-year-old all-time high. Despite this, analysts believe that XRP’s days below its peak are numbered.In his analysis, CrediBULL pointed out that the XRP/ETH pair has just reclaimed and retested a four-year-long range, with the first target potentially being about 250% higher.Currently, the XRP/ETH pair stands at 0.0004390, up by +18.14%. CrediBULL projects a further increase of 246%, bringing it to 0.0008357 ETH by the end of 2025. He envisions an even more promising outlook as the years progress. Bullish Signal on XRP/USDMeanwhile, looking at the XRP/USD pair, CrediBULL pointed out that XRP’s monthly RSI is about entering the overbought region for the first time since 2021. “This is extremely bullish,” he said. He explained that contrary to popular belief, a higher RSI typically signals stronger momentum and a more bullish outlook for the asset—provided there are no bearish divergences. As a result, he concluded that the next target for XRP is $2, and after that, it’s aiming for a new all-time high.",POSITIVE,ETH | XRP,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/23/top-analyst-says-xrp-will-reach-new-ath-sooner-than-expected/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=top-analyst-says-xrp-will-reach-new-ath-sooner-than-expected,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

36735114,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=102391,1732335953,Here’s How High Dogecoin Can Rise if DOGE Gets $50 Billion Daily Volume,"Dogecoin, the first meme coin, has repeatedly shown its capacity for explosive price movements, often coinciding with spikes in trading volume. Historical data reveals that each time Dogecoin (DOGE) sees a price surge, there is an accompanying rise in volume. As a result, understanding the relationship between volume and price could help in projecting what will happen if DOGE achieves a daily volume of $50 billion.Historical Context Between DOGE’s Volume and PriceDogecoin reached its all-time high above $0.73 in May 2021, fueled by a surge in daily trading volume, which peaked at about $46 billion, according to market data from CoinMarketCap.This massive rise was influenced by retail enthusiasm, celebrity endorsements like Elon Musk’s tweets, and market-wide euphoria. At its peak, Dogecoin’s market cap exceeded $98 billion, making it one of the top crypto assets by valuation at the time.However, as DOGE dropped from the $0.73 peak, investor participation reduced, leading to an equal slump in trade volume. In recent times, Dogecoin’s 24-hour volume averaged $3.5 billion.Nonetheless, this figure surged massively amid the latest election-induced increase in price. For context, Dogecoin spiked 177% from $0.1582 on Nov. 5 to a three-year peak of $0.4385 on Nov. 12. Within this period, volume rose beyond $19 billion and particularly hit a peak of $39.9 billion on Nov. 12.Dogecoin Potential Price at $50B VolumeCurrently, Dogecoin trades at around $0.3945 with a 24-hour volume of $8.7 billion. This is in contrast to its 2021 heights, confirming the important role of volume in driving upward momentum. When trading volume spikes, it typically signifies heightened interest and liquidity, which can amplify price movements, especially in speculative assets like DOGE.The relationship between trading volume and price is not straightforward, as price is determined by supply and demand. However, we can make a simplified estimate based on the proportional increase in trading volume and assume that higher volume leads to higher prices due to increased demand. Using this as a benchmark, If trading volume increases to $50 billion per day and we assume proportionality, the price of Dogecoin could rise to approximately $1.23 per coin. The Price of $1.23 would imply a new market cap of roughly $212 billion, which would place Dogecoin among the most valuable cryptocurrencies. This would require significant, sustained interest and investment.However, this would depend on several factors. The first is a rise in demand . Notably, higher trading volume often translates to rising demand. With $50 billion in daily activity, massive capital inflows could push prices higher, especially if new buyers enter the market.However, the second factor is speculative momentum. Crypto assets thrive on speculation, and Dogecoin, as a meme token, benefits from social media buzz and community-driven hype. A volume surge could attract traders aiming to capitalize on short-term price spikes.Also, greater liquidity from high volume can lead to sharper price movements, particularly if large transactions occur. If most of the volume consists of buy orders, upward pressure on DOGE’s price would be substantial.",NEUTRAL,DOGE,BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/23/heres-how-high-dogecoin-can-rise-if-doge-gets-50-billion-daily-volume/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=heres-how-high-dogecoin-can-rise-if-doge-gets-50-billion-daily-volume,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

However, the momentum waned as SHIB retraced to levels below $0.00002303. With Bitcoin witnessing a push towards $100,000, SHIB investors have urged the development team to implement strategies that could catalyze a substantial rally Key Catalysts For Shiba Inu Price In response to these appeals, Shytoshi Kusama, the lead developer of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, addressed the community’s concerns by highlighting SHIB’s achievements and catalysts which will enhance the SHIB token valuation. Emphasizing the token’s prominence on the Ethereum blockchain, Kusama first stated via X: “‘Hey dude send Shib to the moon.’ Checks we are still #1 eth token in the world.” Addressing the notion that SHIB is merely a get-rich-quick scheme, a user commented: “What people don’t get is this token is about function and not just get rich quick.” Kusama agreed, replying that a superior technology and adoption are the key catalyst for the Shiba Inu token price: “Because through function we change the world and wagmi. No leader. Lots of tech. Unparalleled vision in the entirety of crypto. What more can you ask for?” Kusama wrote. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Could See A 53% Surge If This Resistance Breaks, Analyst Explains The conversation also turned to SHIB: The Metaverse, a project anticipated to drive broader adoption of the Shiba Inu ecosystem. When asked about its launch, Kusama revealed: “I expect a MV update in the Shib Mag soon :)” SHIB: The Metaverse is envisioned as a virtual world within the SHIB ecosystem, offering a digital playground where users can socialize, game, and trade digital assets. This metaverse aims to integrate Shiba Inu’s community, tokens, and services like ShibaSwap into a cohesive online environment. Users will be able to purchase virtual land, create unique experiences, and potentially mirror real-life businesses. Concerns about competition from other meme tokens were also addressed by Kusama. When a user asked about the competition from Dogecoin (DOGE) and BONK, Kusama emphasized that the SHIB ecosystem will be on an enterprise level: “I hope all memes do well so that wagmi. But they are playing ‘I Declare War’ and I am on the enterprise playing multilevel chess with the shields raised saying Check to a Klingon. #kipla” he stated. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Ready To Roar! Analyst Calls For A 200% Spike Further emphasizing upcoming developments, Kusama announced via X: “Analysis: Shib is still King! Bone is key. Leash is strong. TREAT is Coming.” He added shortly after: “Reminder that TREAT released by Shib Core is not yet available.” The TREAT token, designed as an access key to advanced features within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, is set to be released soon. This token will complement the existing SHIB, BONE, and LEASH tokens, each serving distinct roles within the ecosystem. While LEASH focuses on exclusivity and BONE on technology, TREAT will unlock advanced functionalities, enriching the overall user experience. In July, Kusama elaborated: “As you may know, Shib is home to a variety of tokens, including Shib, Bone, Leash, and our upcoming unreleased token: TREAT. Each token has its own utility and governance, and TREAT is the access token to all the advanced features of our system, in contrast to Leash, which is about exclusivity, or Bone, which focuses on technology.” Hinting at another potential catalyst, Kusama retweeted a post by artchick.eth (@digitalartchick), who speculated: “Memecoin ETF within 10 months.” Kusama commented: “I didn’t say it…. but I did RT it.” The prospect of a memecoin ETF in the United States is significant. Similar to the US spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, a memecoin ETF could attract substantial inflows from investors currently unable to access memecoin markets. Given its status as the second-largest memecoin by market capitalization, Shiba Inu would be a prime candidate for inclusion. At press time, SHIB traded at $0.00002502.

36727303,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654371,1732327255,Cardano Gains Steam: ADA Sights More Growth After Breaking $0.8119,"Cardano (ADA) is making waves in the crypto market, surging past the $0.8119 level in a bold display of bullish strength. This breakout marks a significant turning point, signaling growing confidence among investors and renewed optimism for ADA’s price. With this critical resistance now in the rearview, Cardano is set to aim even higher. Could this be the beginning of a sustained rally that pushes ADA to new heights? As market sentiment improves and the bulls take charge, the focus is on analyzing Cardano’s surge beyond the $0.8119 level, exploring the key drivers behind its rally, and evaluating the prospects for continued upward movement toward higher price targets. Market Sentiment: Growing Confidence In ADA’s Potential On the 4-hour chart, ADA is striving to extend its gains after breaking past the $0.8119 level while remaining above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). Holding above this critical mark and the 100-day SMA highlights ADA’s strength and potential for further price growth as it aims at new highs. An examination of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) reveals a notable rebound, rising sharply from a recent low of 55% to its current level of 70%. While this increase signals growing positive market sentiment, it raises concerns about the rally’s sustainability since a price correction could occur if profit-taking ensues. Overall, the steady increase in the RSI highlights ADA’s resilience and strengthens the outlook for continued price growth in the near term. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Bullish Move For Cardano Price To Cross $5, Here’s When Furthermore, Cardano is demonstrating robust upward momentum after breaking through the key $0.8119 resistance level, maintaining its position above the 100-day SMA. Its solid performance highlights sustained bullish strength, signalling that the digital asset is well-positioned for more price appreciation, with the 100-day SMA indicating the potential for a persistent uptrend. Finally, the RSI on the daily chart is currently at 66%, well above the crucial 50% threshold, reflecting a strong ascent for Cardano. This level suggests that the bullish move is likely to persist, with Cardano’s price expected to continue rising in the near term as the RSI approaches the overbought zone. What The $0.8119 Breakout Signals For Cardano The $0.8119 breakout represents a key milestone for ADA, signaling a shift in market sentiment toward a more optimistic outlook. This breach of resistance indicates that Cardano is gaining momentum, with the possibility of additional price gains, targeting the $1.2630 resistance level and beyond. Related Reading: Cardano Price Set To Skyrocket By 430%, Crypto Analyst Predicts However, if the resistance proves to be strong, ADA may experience a pullback or enter a consolidation phase, with the price likely retracing to the $0.8119 support level. A sustained drop below this critical support could signal a shift in momentum, potentially leading to deeper declines.

This surge has reignited investor optimism, especially as Ethereum approaches its yearly highs. Key data from CryptoQuant highlights a significant bullish signal: Ethereum’s Taker Buy Volume hit an astonishing $1.683 billion in a single hourly candle. This metric reflects aggressive buying activity in the futures market, further supporting Ethereum’s potential for continued upward momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Open Interest Hits ATH As BTC Nears $100K – What To Expect? The driving force behind this rising demand for Ethereum appears to stem from profits being cycled out of Bitcoin. With Bitcoin consistently breaking all-time highs, investors are reallocating gains into ETH, boosting its price. Ethereum’s ability to capitalize on Bitcoin’s momentum underscores its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency and a key player in the broader market trend. However, the next few days will be crucial for Ethereum as it nears its yearly highs. A strong breakout above these levels could propel ETH into a new uptrend, further strengthening its bullish narrative. Ethereum Bulls Waking Up Ethereum bulls are finally showing signs of life after eight months of bearish price action, with the price surging over 40% since November 5. This strong upward momentum aligns with the broader market rally, fueling optimism that Ethereum’s recovery is just beginning. The resurgence in bullish sentiment has positioned Ethereum as a key focus for investors seeking opportunities in the current market environment. According to data by CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn, Ethereum’s Taker Buy Volume recently hit $1.683 billion in a single hourly candle, highlighting significant demand and the involvement of high-volume trades. This aggressive buying activity is a bullish signal, suggesting increased confidence in Ethereum’s potential to sustain its rally. Strong demand at this scale creates upward pressure on the price, reinforcing the bullish narrative for ETH. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Driven By U.S. Coinbase Investors – Top Analyst Shares Metrics However, Ethereum still faces a critical hurdle at the $3,550 level, a significant supply zone that has acted as a barrier since late July. The next few days will be pivotal for Ethereum, as breaking above this key resistance could signal the continuation of its upward trajectory. Failure to do so, however, might result in a short-term consolidation. All eyes are now on ETH, as its next moves could set the tone for the altcoin market. ETH Holding Above Key Levels Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $3,333 after a 10% surge yesterday, marking a significant rebound for the second-largest cryptocurrency. The price is testing a critical supply zone just below the $3,450 level, a resistance area that bulls need to reclaim to confirm the uptrend and maintain momentum for new highs. This supply zone has historically acted as a key barrier, and breaking above it with conviction would signal strong buying pressure and the potential for a sustained rally. Holding above the 200-day moving average (MA) at $2,959 further strengthens the bullish case for Ethereum, as this indicator is widely regarded as a benchmark for long-term price trends. Related Reading: Solana Analyst Expects A Retrace Before It Breaks ATH – Targets Revealed Should Ethereum maintain its position above the 200-day MA and push decisively past the $3,450 level, it could pave the way for a bullish rally, targeting higher resistance zones in the coming days.

For now, the market focuses on Ethereum’s ability to clear this crucial resistance and continue its upward trajectory.
