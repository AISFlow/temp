42381864,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pyKZ,1557437452,Halving Rally: Litecoin's Price Logs Biggest Monthly Winning Streak Since 2017,"Litecoin's blockchain is set to undergo a mining reward halving in August this year, as it is programmatically designed to do so after every 840,000 blocks are mined or roughly once every four years.  The process is aimed at controlling inflation by reducing the rewards for mining on the blockchain from 25 coins to 12.5 coins and seems to have put a strong bid under the cryptocurrency.  Litecoin has scored gains in each of the previous four months – its longest monthly winning streak since August 2017. Prices rallied 3.8, 46.3, 31.15 and 22 percent in January, February, March and April, respectively, according to CoinDesk data.  Why does the halving matter?  Associating litecoin's rally with the reward halving makes sense as the process results in reduced production of the cryptocurrency's supply. Miners will be earning 50 percent fewer coins for every block mined after August and will be adding significantly fewer litecoins to the software's ecosystem, possibly leading to supply deficit.  Markets are always forward-looking and tend to price in such demand/supply-altering events often times several months in advance.  Backing that argument is historical data which shows the price of litecoin had rallied sharply in seven months leading up to its first reward halving, which took place on August 25, 2016.  Litecoin’s Halving and Price History  Back then, LTC had bottomed out at $1.12 in January 2015 to print a high of $8.72 in July before falling back below $4.00 ahead of Aug. 25.  This time, the cryptocurrency bottomed out $22 in December and has surged by more than 250 percent ever since. The rally may not be over yet as the halving event is still three months away and traders who missed the bus in the first quarter may enter the market in the next few weeks, creating upward pressure on prices.  Also, the implication of a ""halving"" and its historical impact on price will start getting more attention as the event nears, potentially inviting more buyers to the market.  All said, events that get priced into the value of a traded asset well in advance of the actual date tend to experience a ""sell the news"" effect once the event has in fact taken place or slightly before it.  Case in point, this is what transpired in the few weeks leading up to litecoin's first halving in 2015.  As the date approached, investors began to lock in profits by selling the digital asset after it topped out in July 2015, one month prior to the reward halving. The month of the halving itself, in fact, closed with litecoin's price nearly 40% lower than when it started, further confirming investors lost interest in the cryptocurrency after the highly anticipated halving event had concluded.  After the supply cut, litecoin's price trend remained sideways for nearly two years before surging to new all-time highs in 2017, potentially laying the blueprint for what is to come after its block rewards are halved once more.

42381859,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pyFX,1557434702,Crypto-Friendly US Congress Members Join New Fintech Task Force,"The U.S. House of Representatives is launching a new task force aimed specifically at financial technology – including blockchain.  The new task force, referred to as the FinTech Task Force, was established by the House Financial Services Committee by a voice vote Thursday, and will examine blockchain and cryptocurrency tools, among others. The task force will be headed up by Massachusetts Rep. Stephen Lynch.  Its initial list of issues includes regulating fintech from both domestic and international perspectives; lending and using ""alternative data"" for loan underwriting; examining the legal and regulatory frameworks for payments, as well as the infrastructure; and data privacy.  Blockchain proponents Warren Davidson, Tom Emmer and Josh Gottheimer are three of the task force's new members. Davidson has now twice introduced the Token Taxonomy Act to Congress, a sweeping bill aimed at exempting cryptocurrencies from securities law and providing digital assets with a clearer legal standing in the U.S.  Emmer has likewise pushed for a bill that would exempt cryptocurrency startups from state-level regulations, allowing them to develop blockchain platforms and services without having to register as a money transmission business in the states they conduct business in – provided they don't hold or trade cryptos.  Gottheimer has recently been an active member of the crypto space, co-sponsoring the Token Taxonomy Act after it was reintroduced by Davidson last month.  In a statement, he said,  ""As blockchain, new lending options, and other financial technologies continue to emerge, it is clear that there must be a framework in place that not only provides a much clearer path forward for innovation, but also establishes the United States as a leading force in this space.""  Lynch, Gottheimer, Emmer, Davidson and task force member Bryan Steil also recently added their names to an open letter urging the Internal Revenue Service to clarify how the tax collector is assessing gains and losses on crypto holdings.  Other members of the task force include Reps. David Scott, Al Lawson, Cindy Axne, Ben McAdams, Jennifer Wexton, French Hill and Blaine Luetkemeyer.  Crypto has its share of critics on Capitol Hill, too, including Rep. Brad Sherman of California, who called Thursday for a bill to ban all cryptocurrencies, something he's advocated in the past.

42381857,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pyAV,1557430260,SEC Commissioner Fears 'Heel-Dragging' Will Stifle Crypto Innovation,"Hester M. Peirce, a member of the Securities and Exchange Commission, is worried that the regulator is moving too slowly for the crypto ecosystem.  Addressing  fellow regulators at the Securities Enforcement Forum in Palo Alto, California (the heart of Silicon Valley) on Monday, Peirce said that one year ago she was concerned that the SEC ""as one of [the token market's] potential regulators, would stifle its growth.""  She wryly added: ""I will admit today that I was very wrong, not about whether the SEC would stifle the industry’s growth—it has—but in how it would do it.""  Rather than being heavyhanded in enforcing the rules as she feared, the agency has instead been too sluggish to clarify or update them, Peirce explained:  I worried that hasty regulation would smother the industry in its infancy. My concerns did not become reality. The enforcement actions we have taken to date in the crypto space have—for the most part—exhibited appropriate restraint. On the regulatory side, ""hasty"" is not the word I would use to describe the SEC’s pace. It is not the SEC’s overzealous action that has stifled the crypto industry, but its unwillingness to take meaningful action at all.  Her primary concern is that while the SEC has done a great deal to reach out to fast-moving startups, the tools it uses to assess when regulations apply – including the Howey test for determining whether something meets the definition of a security – are still dangerously out-of-date.  To be sure, Peirce credited the SEC for being open and forward-thinking about communicating with startups. The SEC's FinHub network has been leading in startup outreach and most recently held a meetup in Denver where blockchain companies came to speak directly with regulators.  Unfortunately, she said, things aren't moving fast enough on the clarity front:  The SEC has yet to provide guidance to the public or FINRA on any of the core questions. The result is that many would-be brokers and trading platforms are stuck in a frustrating waiting mode; they are unable to get clear answers to questions about how they may proceed in this market.  While emphasizing that she was proud of the work done by the SEC and its attendant securities markets, Peirce warned that the current inertia threatens to undermine those successes, concluding:  ""The U.S. securities markets have historically been the envy of the world; I do not want heel-dragging by the SEC in crypto to mar that well-deserved reputation.""

42381865,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pyN5,1557426005,Weekly Bitcoin Price Indicator Prints Strongest Bull Signal Since Early 2018,"A technical indicator used to identify the momentum behind asset prices is registering its highest value since the beginning of 2018 when applied to bitcoin, a possible positive sign for the cryptocurrency's market.  The relative strength index (RSI) takes into account the speed and change in price movements, i.e. momentum, to reveal when the trend of the underlying asset is shifting from bearish to bullish market conditions and vice versa, as well as when it has become overextended.  Traditionally, an RSI value above 70 is considered to be “overbought” and a pullback in price becomes likely, whereas a value below 30 depicts an “oversold” market that is usually due for a positive correction.  The RSI of 50 tends to act as the dividing line between a market that is bullish and one that is not.  Bitcoin’s RSI on the weekly time frame, which speaks to the momentum of its longer-term trend, is showing newfound strength while printing 65 - its highest value since the week of Jan. 8, 2018, just a few weeks after the cryptocurrency reached its all-time high near $20,000.  BTC/USD Weekly Chart  As is shown in Bitcoin’s weekly price chart above, the RSI has indeed surpassed the traditional bull market barrier of 50, as well as the range of 53-60, which acted as a base during the 2016-2017 bull market as well as resistance to its preceding bear market.  From early 2014 to late 2015, the weekly RSI was unable to scale above 60, capping any momentum the cryptocurrency had gained during that stretch.  In October of 2015, however, the RSI was finally able to break above the level, in turn showing the momentum had gained enough strength to shift the entire market from a bear to bull trend. Bitcoin's price then went on to rally some 8,000 percent all while the weekly RSI remained above 53.  Interestingly, the same development seems to have just occurred with bitcoin's latest push above $6,000, putting its market momentum firmly back in historically bullish territory.  All said, the RSI values on the lower time frames are already overbought so corrections in price can be expected, but the longer term bullish view on bitcoin's market will remain intact so as long as its weekly RSI can defend 53, the base RSI of the previous bull market.  A general rule of thumb is to use indicators like the RSI in conjunction with other indicators to avoid any false signals. In this case, bitcoin's price trading above the 200-day moving average and its MACD having completed a bullish cross indeed solidify the bullish argument presented by the weekly RSI.

42381868,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pyPb,1557423939,Desktop Crypto Mining App Honeyminer Comes to MacOS,"HoneyMiner, a desktop-based crypto mining application, has released a new version for MacOS users.  HoneyMiner  , which launched in July 2018, accesses your CPU or GPU and uses it to mine various cryptos. A central server points the connected machines at a certain target like ethereum, ethereum classic, zcash, monero and other GPU-friendly currencies.  ""We have over 1,400 different kinds of GPUs on our network and it's all about routing the right computation to its most optimal use case and whichever chain is optimal,"" said co-founder and CEO Noah Jessop.  The HoneyMiner app takes 2.5% of the proceeds for multi-GPU machines and 8% from single GPU users.  The Mac OS app works just like the Windows version. Upon launching the app you get 1,000 free satoshis and I was able to mine the equivalent of six cents in ten minutes.  This writer's estimated 24-hour earnings on a 2016 MacBook Pro running a 2.9 GHz Intel Core i5 was 113 satoshis or - and don't get jealous - $0.012 USD. The expectation is that users with more powerful computers will speed up the mining pool considerably.  HoneyMiner joins apps like DesktopMining.net and open source solutions like MultiMiner in its aim to make it easy to mine on almost any machine. They expanded to MacOS thanks to public demand.  ""We launched on Windows first because there are so many powerful GPUs sitting under people’s desks around the world and lots of folks getting started with mining do so on windows,"" said Jessop. ""We’ve now got people in 167 countries on Honeyminer and have had literally hundreds of requests for Mac OS from our community.""  Porting the app to MacOS was quite a chore, said Jessop.  ""Mac was really tricky to run super smoothly on both CPU and GPU when available team spent months - maybe even too long - making it work,"" he said.

42381852,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9py4D,1557423020,FinCEN Says Some Dapps Are Subject to US Money Transmitter Rules,"Decentralized applications (dapps) may qualify as money transmitters under U.S. law in certain circumstances, the nation's anti-money-laundering (AML) regulator said.  The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) published a new guidance sheet Thursday, outlining when and how different companies, individuals and platforms in the crypto space may be money transmitters under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and other relevant laws. The document highlighted dapps among other models.  Being designated a money transmitter under FinCEN rules means a firm or person must follow federal AML and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations.  In Thursday's notice, the U.S. Treasury Department's AML bureau said that while it ""does not establish any new regulatory expectations or requirements,"" it does combine several previous documents issued over the past eight years, and details in greater specificity how participants in the space might violate AML regulations.  Dapps, the document noted, are ""designed such that they are not controlled by a single person or group of persons,"" meaning there is no single entity operating as the dapp's administrator.  However, if a dapp ""accept[s] and transmit[s] value,"" it qualifies as a money transmitter under the same regulatory interpretation applied to crypto-dispensing vending machines, FinCEN said.  The guidance said:  ""Accordingly, when dapps perform money transmission, the definition of money transmitter will apply to the dapp, the owners/operators of the dapp, or both.""  However, the developers behind a dapp – even a dapp specifically designed to issue cryptocurrencies or at least facilitate financial services in crypto – do not qualify as money transmitters until the dapp is put into use.  Users of a dapp may also fall under FinCEN regulations, the guidance said. Any investors or operators of a dapp who use it to transfer funds would be classified as money transmitters themselves.  Wallets and DEXs  Other aspects of the document could have far-reaching impacts, touching on crypto payment processors as one example.  Non-hosted wallets (such as Blockchain.com), meaning those where users control their funds, are exempted from possible money transmitter classifications but hosted online wallets (such as Coinbase, which holds the private keys for customers' funds) are not.  There are some other exemptions as well: any person who provides support services to a money transmitter, acts as a payment processor for a good or service (that isn't specifically money transmission) or acts as an intermediary between BSA-regulated institutions does not qualify as money transmitters.  Some decentralized exchanges (DEXs), if they only match buyers with sellers but do not touch any cryptocurrency (or fiat) during the transaction, would also be exempted from a money transmitter designation.  However, payment processors which convert crypto to fiat and vice versa at the point of sale do not get the exemption usually granted to processors that only facilitate the purchase of goods and services, FinCEN said.  That's because traditional processors only work with financial institutions that are regulated under the BSA. Such institutions ""have greater visibility into the complete pattern of activities"" of the buyer and the seller, FinCEN said, but when a payment processor is using crypto rails, ""this visibility simply does not exist ... unless the [crypto] payment processor complies with the reporting obligations of a money transmitter.""  Individuals, platforms and companies that do not fall under a federal exemption are required to register with FinCEN as a money services business (MSB), develop anti-money laundering programs and report currency transactions, as well as any suspicious activity.  Those who fail to do so run the risk of being fined and charged with a misdemeanor or felony, according to the Legal Information Institute.  UPDATE (May 10, 2019, 00:40 UTC): This article originally indicated that state licensing requirements were a factor in money transmitter designations. With regard to FinCEN and its guidance, they are not.

42381853,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9py6j,1557421220,'We'll Tokenize the House': Mortgages Are Coming to Ethereum This Summer,"On Thursday the fintech startup Fluidity will announce plans for the first ethereum-powered mortgages in California and New York, CoinDesk has learned.  Fluidity  execs say the offering is slated for this summer, once all the licensing paperwork is finalized.  “We’ll tokenize the house, which will effectively take the collateral that is the equity of the house,” said Fluidity chief architect Todd Lippiatt. “You’re pledging the house and you get an advanced rate back in terms of dollars.”  Fluidity formed in early 2019 when the ConsenSys decentralized exchange (DEX) merged with the FINRA-registered broker-dealer Propellr. Fluidity co-founder Sam Tabar told CoinDesk that although ethereum mogul and ConsenSys founder Joe Lubin is still a major shareholder in AirSwap, now a Fluidity subsidiary, the newborn parent company has a distinct set of shareholders – including veteran crypto investors like Brock Pierce, Bill Tai and Lubin’s former college roommate, Mike Novogratz.  Fluidity’s upcoming mortgages will use smart contracts and cryptocurrency for back-end management. Lippiatt told CoinDesk his startup is currently exploring partnerships with ethereum-centric lending platforms, such as MakerDAO’s dollar-pegged DAI loans.  Although the ethereum-backed stablecoin is still struggling to achieve stability and liquidity in broader markets, Lippiatt said mortgages from any such prospective partnership would merely involve a “mitigatable” risk. This is, in part, because neither the borrower nor the property seller will directly touch cryptocurrency.  “We will deal with the inner workings of the decentralized system,” he said. “The borrowers pay back in dollars and we will also be managing the risk profile of the underlying securities.”  In short, borrowers will need to submit online credit checks and personal information just like any other online loan platform. Fluidity processes the information and creates a smart contract with a tokenized representation of the mortgage. Lippiatt said these loans could then be packaged together and resold as securities through an exchange like AirSwap.  In his view, underbanked and low-income borrowers who are able to make repayments represent a prime opportunity for such loans.  “The whole portfolio will be a composition of a bunch of different loans,” he said. “We’re looking at methodologies by which we can deploy [underwriting] more algorithmically.”  DeFi smart contracts will provide theoretically auditable records, plus Lippiatt said Fluidity plans to offer cheaper rates than banks. Still, the process itself offers the borrower a quasi-traditional mortgage. It’s the issuer and subsequent traders who gain the most functionality from this blockchain system.  In conclusion, Lippiatt added:  “Our methodology provides better pricing that is determined solely by the intrinsic credit of the transaction, as opposed to external factors like domestic central bank governance policies and political trade winds.”  The company plans to make the announcement later today at its second Fluidity Summit in Brooklyn. The one-day conference sold 900 tickets this year, 120 more than in 2018, according to event staff.

42381860,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pyEH,1557419255,"'Critical' MakerDAO Vulnerability Could Have Frozen Voter Funds, Auditors Say","A critical vulnerability on the programmatic lending platform MakerDAO could have made user funds irretrievable, according to security audit firm Zeppelin.  Discovered in the last few weeks, MakerDAO issued Monday an urgent plea to token holders of the MakerDAO platform, writing on Reddit:  “In partnership with Coinbase and Zeppelin, the Maker Foundation has been participating in a second round of audits of the Maker Voting Contract. During this process, we discovered the need to make a critical update...You are advised to move your MKR out of the old contract and back into your personal wallet immediately.”  At the time, MKR token holders were not debriefed about the exact nature of the issue given the vulnerability could still be exploited by an attacker if disclosed.  On Thursday, Zeppelin released a full disclosure outlining how the vulnerability could have moved user tokens and locked them permanently within the MakerDAO voting contract. According to the document, the vulnerability was discovered and analyzed between April 22 and 26, at which point the MakerDAO team was informed, with a fixed contract being subject to an audit on May 2.  A separate post on the MakerDAO subreddit discussed the vulnerability and shared information about the new and uncompromised voting contract. ""Due to the exploit, the usual weekly cadence of Governance Polling and Executive Voting was paused as MKR holders transitioned themselves out of the old contract,"" the post explained.  Taking a step back, MakerDAO is the preeminent lending platform for popular dollar-pegged stablecoin DAI. MakerDAO is also a decentralized governance platform through which MKR token holders have the power to vote on and execute changes to the DAI lending protocol.  “How the MakerDAO system of governance works is that there are several proposals which are encoded as ethereum addresses and people can vote for one or the other by locking their MKR tokens in the chief voting contract,” explained head of research at Zeppelin Alejo Salles to CoinDesk.  In essence, the vulnerability disclosed by the Zeppelin team jeopardized the MKR tokens held within the MakerDAO voting contract. An attacker could have hypothetically moved tokens staked in favor of one MakerDAO governance proposal to another competing proposal and locked them in place forever.  Salles stressed to CoinDesk that MKR tokens were not able to be withdrawn from the MakerDAO voting contract but rather simply locked and moved.  More audits  This vulnerability, as far as Zeppelin is currently aware, hasn't been exploited on the MakerDAO platform.  However, Salles noted that it did have the potential to effectively freeze $100 million worth of MKR tokens held in the original MakerDAO voting contract.  “This contract was very central in the MakerDAO system. It had privileges over many other things,” notes Salles to CoinDesk. “Security is very sensitive in the crypto industry and in this case was possible because the MakerDAO team still has enough funds to make the change.”  Indeed, the non-profit MakerDAO Foundation holds by far the largest share of MKR tokens, with over 25 percent of the 1 million total supply. Given the highly sensitive nature of the security vulnerability, the MakerDAO Foundation leveraged the funds at its disposal to secretly execute a state change without broader public awareness.  “In a more decentralized system, which is what MakerDAO will be in the near future, this would have been much worse,” warns Salles. “Because you have to coordinate all these people but at the same time not raise too much awareness of what’s going on. That’s sort of impossible.”  The code behind the MakerDAO voting contract is part of a larger library of code that was fully inspected back in 2017 by security firm Trail of Bits.  When asked whether Trail of Bits had known about the vulnerability disclosed today, CEO Dan Guido affirmed they did not but added that since 2017 ""there have been many commits to that specific code and to many of its dependencies.""  Trail of Bits this month completed a new audit over highly-anticipated MakerDAO code to support multi-collateral DAI. As Guido told CoinDesk:  ""In the course of our assessment of multi-collateral Dai, we discovered two low severity security issues that escaped identification by verification. The first issue escaped verification due to the attack's reliance on the passage of time to pull it off. The second issue was economic in nature, and described an attack strategy to abuse the system based on its correct behavior. These issues were fixed immediately by MakerDAO.""  Due diligence  The secondary audit of the MakerDAO voting contract by Zeppelin was actually contracted by cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. Coinbase has for some time been planning to enable a seamless interface with the MakerDAO voting platform for holders of MKR tokens.  “We spearheaded the audit as part of our due diligence process in supporting the MakerDAO voting capability within the Coinbase Custody product,” said Alan Leung, head of security for Coinbase Custody.  Leung explained that Coinbase clients holding MKR tokens were not comfortable directly interfacing with the MakerDAO voting protocol given that “they don’t know the risk or the risks outweigh the act of participation.”  According to Leung, part of Coinbase’s efforts in supporting a third-party audit of the MakerDAO voting contact code was to ensure that capabilities being built on Coinbase to interface with MakerDAO were secure.  “Our vision is to provide our customers a secure channel for network participation and as part of this process we dived fairly deeply into how the MakerDAO contract works and how voting works,” said Leung to CoinDesk.  With the vulnerability having been disclosed and addressed, Leung affirmed with CoinDesk that intention to launch MKR voting capability on Coinbase Custody remain unchanged.  “We've done our homework in making sure [our interface] is the most secure way to participate in the MakerDAO network because we’re putting our label behind the action,"" he told CoinDesk.

42381866,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pyLp,1557415805,Fundamental Labs Fund to Invest $44 Million in Brand-New Bitcoin Miners,"Fundamental Labs, a blockchain fund manager that’s backed Binance, Coinbase and Canaan Creative, is investing $44 million in top-of-the-line bitcoin miners, a longer-term bet than most are making in the sector.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, the Shanghai-based firm plans to run 20,000 to 30,000 units of brand-new mining equipment starting in June to capture on the cheap hydropower electricity during the rainy summer in China’s southwestern region.  “Mining is the fundamental block to support the whole crypto ecosystem. That’s why we invest in mining farms, equipment and pools and participate in mining ourselves,” Howard Yuan, managing partner of Fundamental Labs, told CoinDesk.  But unlike what most retail miners have been doing – buying second-hand miners ahead of the summer – Yuan’s firm is maximizing its mining scale by investing in the latest and most powerful equipment on the market, such as Bitmain’s AntMiner S17.  The unit price of these newest mining models made by manufacturers like Bitmain, InnoSilicon and MicroBT, ranges from $1,500 to $2,000 each, and will be ready for shipment in large quantities over the next two months.  “We don’t buy old machines since our focus is to participate in mining for the long term. And second-hand equipment like AntMiner S9 won’t be useful once the summer season ends,” Yuan said.  The capital for this investment comes from a 300 million yuan, or $44 million, mining fund that Fundamental Labs recently closed, which is the first phase of its overall plan to raise 1 billion yuan ($150 million) this year exclusively for further deployment in cryptocurrency mining.  Yuan said the firm was launched in 2016 with about $30 million of its proprietary capital, and has since then grown the total portfolio to over $500 million through five series of funds. Its holdings include an equity investment in Coinbase (which the U.S. crypto exchange confirmed to CoinDesk) and Binance's BNB token.  The firm declined to disclose the names of its limited partners, except to say they are from the traditional industries as well as family offices in China.  Because it’s using brand new products, Yuan said Fundamental also will be less risk-averse than individual miners when facing bitcoin's price volatility. He told CoinDesk:  “We think crypto mining will become more institutionalized in the future. It’s crypto capitalism. Retail miners will be gradually squeezed out because of challenges like price volatility and increasing computing difficulties.”  Hash rate boost  Such new capital entering the crypto mining space with more powerful equipment will likely give another boost to bitcoin’s total hash rate in the coming months.  While InnoSilicon and Bitmain’s new products, such as T3 and AntMiner S17 can compute as much as 45 to 50 trillion hashes per second (TH/s), Shenzhen-based MicroBT claims its latest M20S can even reach 70TH/s.  Even assuming Fundamental Labs will run all of its 20,000 to 30,000 units with the least powerful of those, its plan could increase the bitcoin network’s total hash rate by at least 1,000 quadrillion hashes per second (PH/s).  That would account for about two percent of bitcoin’s total hash rate at the moment, which is around 50,000 PH/s, according to data from Blockchain.info.  On May 2, the bitcoin network’s total computing power reached a six-month high above 58,000 PH/s. Mining farm operators in China previously estimated this figure will go up to 70,000 PH/s during the summer.  Yuan said with the plan to raise a total of $150 million for its mining fund this year, the firm will further build up and maintain a mining scale that consumes about 200,000 kilowatts per hour (kWh).  Given the company only considers the latest mining equipment, which mostly consumes two to three kWh, each, that means it aims to scale up its facility to run 60,000 to 100,000 units of new equipment in total throughout the year.  That could translate to a hash rate boost between 3,000 PH/s to 5,000 PH/s to the bitcoin network. By comparison, mining giant Bitmain currently owns about 2,000 PH/s, or four percent, of the bitcoin blockchain's computing power.  After the summer season, Yuan said his firm will shift its focus to other provinces in China like Xinjiang which has more fossil fuel power stations, as well as central Asian countries like Kazakhstan.

Dong Zhao, founder of DGroup and an over-the-counter (OTC) trader in China who owns equity in Bitfinex, said in a WeChat post on Thursday that ""there's a high possibility Bitfinex will not conduct a public sale"" for its token offering called LEO.  Zhao told CoinDesk that the exchange has received both hard and soft commitments of $1 billion worth of USDT, the U.S. dollar-pegged cryptocurrency issued by Tether, a company that shares owners and management with Bitfinex.  The soft commitment means those investors have not yet locked in their USDT for LEO and have the option to back out from the deal. As such, it does not mean Bitfinex has successfully raised all the intended amount. If any of these investors withdraw in the end, the remaining tokens will be issued to others on a first come, first serve basis, Zhao said.  Bitfinex announced the token sale earlier this month, just days after the New York Attorney General's office revealed that it was looking for more information about the exchange's cover-up of an alleged $850 million loss. The missing funds, which were held by payment processor Crypto Capital, were reportedly seized by Polish, Portuguese and U.S. authorities.  Zhao said his firm has already invested in the LEO token with a hard commitment but declined to share how much. It's not yet clear at this stage how much in hard commitments Bitfinex has received. But Zhao said the hard commitments include $20 million from users of his crypto-lending application Renrenbit.  News of the commitments comes just a day after Bitfinex released an official white paper for the $1 billion token sale. Though previous reports indicated there could be a public sale after the private phase ends if it's not yet fully raised, Bitfinex was vague about this in the white paper.  “If fewer than 1 billion USDT tokens are sold by private token sale, the Issuer may thereafter sell remaining tokens at times and in a manner it deems appropriate in its sole discretion, consistent with applicable law,” the white paper reads.

Instead of buying $30 million of tZERO tokens, as previously agreed, the Hong Kong private equity fund invested just $5 million in tZERO equity, in the traditional form. The finalized transaction valued tZERO’s at $1 billion, less than the $1.5 billion in the initial agreement.  Patrick Byrne, Overstock’s CEO, announced the news Thursday morning during the company's Q1 earnings call, adding:  ""We're letting them [GSR] out of all previous contracts.""  Makara Capital, a Singapore fund brought into the deal by GSR, is still conducting its due diligence of tZERO, and may yet invest the money it pledged earlier, Overstock said. ""We are still working with Makara and feel optimistic (but not certain) that something can be consummated with them (and GSR may join in again at that point),"" the company's Q1 earnings report said.  Despite the sharp reduction in proceeds, tZERO CEO Saum Noursalehi told CoinDesk that the $5 million investment was “a decent offer.” The investment consists of $1 million in U.S. dollars, $1 million worth of Chinese Renminbi, and $3 million worth of ""certain securities,"" according to Overstock.  Long negotiations  The original deal with GSR, announced last summer, was expected to bring $404 million to tZERO, but was postponed several times and downsized to $100 million in March, and then to $30 million in April.  In March, when the deal was postponed for the second time, GSR brought in Makara. The two firms were supposed to co-lead the $100 million investment in tZERO.  As tZERO has not obtained as much external investment as it hoped for, it will for the time being rely on cash from the parent company: earlier plans to sell the Overstock.com online retail business were postponed, too.  “The retail business have quite a bit of capital, they are starting to be cash flow-positive,” Noursalehi told CoinDesk.  To raise additional capital, Overstock sold some of its stock recently, he said — not that it all will go to tZERO, but if it needs money those funds can get “pushed down” to it from the parent company, according to Noursalehi.  This funding served as a “kind of hedge” against the uncertainty in the GSR-Macara deal, he said.  Blockchain progress  On the bright side, tZERO seems to have found a new big client to issue security tokens on its platform.  According to Noursalehi, Dubai-based real estate giant Emaar has signed a letter of intent to issue tokens on tZERO. Emaar owns luxury residential and commercial high-rises, including the world’s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.  Emaar announced plans to do an initial coin offering (ICO) in March in a partnership with the Swiss startup Lykke AG. Neither Emaar’s media representative nor Lykke responded CoinDesk’s requests by press time.  At first, Emaar will do “some initial small, proof-of-concept issuance to prove it out,” Noursalehi said, although the company is looking into launching a token issuance project as big as $2 billion in the next couple of years. No timeline or other details of the future deal are set now, tZERO's CEO said, but “we want to get a definitive contract in the next week or two.”  Elio Motors, a car manufacturer that Byrne has previously said was working on a token issuance with tZERO, will not be among the first issuers on the platform, Noursalehi said. Elio wants to code a more complicated functionality into their tokens, like allowing token holders to get their ordered cars faster, and working on that will take more time, he explained. By the end of this year, tZERO hopes to get up to 10 tokens traded on its alternative trading system (ATS).  Another partnership was announced during the earnings call: this month, tZERO is planning to complete an integration with another tokenization platform, Securitize. According to Noursalehi, tZERO’s team will conduct due diligence of the tokens issued on Securitize and pick some of them to trade on the ATS.  “Securitize seems to be executing well in the space and providing good quality assets,” Noursalehi said.  Also on Thursday's earnings call, Overstock gave a demonstration of the previously announced tZERO crypto trading app, scheduled to go live in June. The app will initially list only bitcoin, ether and, possibly, ravencoin. (The ravencoin blockchain was used by Overstock's venture arm, Medici Ventures, in a pilot earlier.)  As for the other subsidiaries of Medici, Byrne announced that Medici Land Governance, a startup aiming to put land registries on a blockchain, has signed a contract with the government of Zambia, where it's already been working on a pilot covering 50,000 houses. The new contract adds ""250,000 additional homes (and potentially a million or more) in Lusaka over 10 years,"" the Q1 report says.  Going full blockchain?  In the meantime, Overstock is moving some of its own shares to tZERO, a plan it recently notified shareholders about.  These shares, known as “Blockchain Voting Series A Preferred Stock,” were issued in 2016 as the initial proof-of-concept for the future token trading platform.  A new ERC-20 token named OSTK.0 already exists on the ethereum blockchain, but no transactions have been recorded yet.  The shares will be live on tZERO in June, the company said on the earnings call.  In the long term, Overstock is planning to issue more tokenized shares. Ultimately the company could go full blockchain, Noursalehi said, concluding:  “Long term down the road, we may ultimately delist from NASDAQ and have all our stock on tZERO. But [before that can happen] it obviously will have to be a much more liquid market than it is today.”  Image of Patrick Byrne by Anna Baydakova for CoinDesk",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/05/09/hong-kong-funds-projected-400-million-overstock-investment-ends-with-5-million-close,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/619cea12eebcf6a21bd1a27856ac70da2af53018-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The goal? To make crypto and cryptocollectables far easier to use.  ""Dapper is the first publicly available ‘smart wallet’ for the Ethereum blockchain,"" claims Dapper CEO Roham Gharegozlou. ""We’re building Dapper because blockchain is still too hard to access, use, and understand. Dapper’s goal is to make it easy and safe, starting with the technical and design breakthrough of the smart contract wallet itself.""    ""Most people today store their cryptocurrency in centralized exchanges (where they can get stolen) or on individual devices (where they can be lost). This prevents them from having a good experience on applications like CryptoKitties. But Dapper solves for this problem. Dapper secures assets in an open source smart contract and gives the user the master keys, optionally staying on as a co-signer to provide features like prepaid transaction fees and fraud monitoring.""          The wallet runs as a Chrome plugin and connects to crypto sites for payments and storage.  Dapper co-founders Roham Gharegozlou, Mack Flavelle, and Dieter Shirley see their wallet as an easy-to-use alterative to difficult crypto software. Just as their CryptoKitties popularized the idea of crypto collectables and nearly brought the concept to the mainstream, Dapper's goal is to ""build a consumer-friendly gateway that offers decentralization without compromise.""  The wallet will work with popular ethereum-based products like Decentraland, MixMarvel, and Etheremon, allowing you to keep your crypto and collectables in a secure place.  ""Our team is unsatisfied with current solutions: Blockchain’s barrier to entry is still too high, and too many approaches to accessing blockchain compromise the value of the underlying technology,"" said Gharegozlou. "" And that’s what Dapper is today: the first step toward making accessing the blockchain as safe and predictable as surfing the internet.""

Carmi became BitGo's head of financial services, joining the company after working at Tower Research Capital, an asset management firm where he was a global head of the fixed income instruments, currencies, and commodities business. It was there he moved into cryptocurrency trading.  ""When we got into trading crypto we quickly realized there is a big gap in the market,"" he said.  The gap, he found, was that was impossible to trade cryptocurrencies between different venues with the same speed as in traditional markets.  ""If you look at the current equity market, you can buy IBM stock from Goldman Sacks, then hang up the phone and immediately sell it to J.P. Morgan,"" he said.  He believes the same functionality is needed on the crypto market.  ""Being able to buy BTC on one venue, and immediately — could be 100 or 200 milliseconds — sell the same BTC on Gemini, or with Genesis [would be idea],"" he said.  He wouldn't go into details of his future work at BitGo but he does want to try to fix the trading problem.  ""The plan is to build a solution that will allow the institutional clients to get into the crypto space and participate in it as easily as it is for them trading other financial products like equity, fixed income and foreign exchange,"" he said.  ""Forex exchange is getting boring""  Working at an asset management firm, Carmi saw demand for crypto trading from many institutional investors, including pension funds and family offices, but found there was no infrastructure in place that help get them comfortable with this market.  Talking about his own interest in the crypto space, he said:  ""Foreign exchange is becoming very boring, it’s very oversaturated. Equities can't get any more boring. The institutional investors are looking for new outlets to trade and invest.""  Prior to Tower Research Capital, Carmi worked for five years at Deutsche Bank as a head of the foreign exchange prime brokerage. Before that, he spent years on various leading positions at Barclays, Lehman Brothers, UBS and Credit Suisse.  ""Nick brings the right type of experience for BitGo to bridge between the complex technology of digital assets and the traditional financial markets,” said Mike Belshe, CEO of BitGo. “Nick will be critical to our future progress, helping us meet the existing needs of traditional clients while also helping us build a better financial market of the future in ways that can only be done with digital assets.”  Image of Mike Belshe, CEO of BitGo, via CoinDesk archives",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/05/09/bitgo-hires-former-wall-street-forex-trading-exec,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a301291419eb5e3b030f53a120c45f984355352a-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42381855,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9py7z,1557403214,Trading Firms Propose 'Bad Actors Blacklist' to Clean Up Crypto Industry,"A group of cryptocurrency trading firms has come together to discuss ways to prevent the rising number of hacks and scams in the industry.  Ripple, market maker Cumberland, Michael Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital Holdings and over 30 other firms met at a recent round-table event in Chicago for the initiative, Bloomberg reported Thursday.  Creating a list of entities involved directly or indirectly in criminal activities such as money laundering and drug trafficking was one of the ideas. Giving companies in good standing some form of accreditation was another, according to the report.  Another route could be to set standards for verifying identities of customers and their sources of funds. CORA may also share information on actors defaulting on derivatives trades.  Darius Sit, managing partner at trading firm QCP Capital, told the news source:  “A community-wide effort to improve compliance standards would prevent liabilities that might stem from trading with bad actors or dealers that trade with bad actors.”  Such a move to bring more self-governance to the crypto industry is something that regulators have been keen to see, he added.  The event was organized by Crypto OTC Roundtable Asia (CORA), a ""loose association"" of crypto businesses, according to Bloomberg. The firms are yet to take any final decision on the next steps. The group reportedly plans to meet again in the near future to move forward on the discussed ideas.  Notably, on the day of the event itself, hackers stole 7,000 bitcoin (worth over $40 million) from cryptocurrency exchange Binance.  Blockchain analytics firm CipherTrace recently estimated that losses arising from cryptocurrency hacks and fraud may have already reached about $1.2 billion in the first quarter of this year alone (a number that includes Bitfinex's allegedly missing $850 million). The figure is almost 71 percent of the $1.7 billion loss seen over the whole of 2018, the firm said.

42381870,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pyS7,1557400502,Bitcoin's Market Share Hits 8-Month High as Price Passes $6K,"View  Bitcoin's dominance rate has hit 8-month highs, suggesting investor confidence in the recent price rally.  A test of highs above $6,500 seen in November last year now seems likely.  Such a move, however, may be preceded by a pullback to the 10-day moving average at $5,633 if the immediate resistance zone of $6,055–$6,100 remains intact in the next 24 hours or so.  The short-term bullish outlook would be invalidated only by a drop below the 30-day MA at $5,365.      Bitcoin's (BTC) recent rally looks sustainable, according to the charts, and the cryptocurrency's rising dominance rate suggests investors are bullish.  The price of a single bitcoin jumped to $6,099 earlier today, the highest level since November 14, according to Bitstamp data.    Meanwhile, BTC's dominance rate, which tracks its percentage of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization, has also jumped to 57.14 percent, the highest for eight months, according to CoinMarketCap.    A rising dominance rate essentially means the demand for bitcoin is greater than the demand for alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) and suggests that investors are buying bitcoins for the long haul and not merely to fund altcoin purchases (which often can't be bought with fiat).  Bitcoin price/dominance rate comparison (2019)  Bitcoin's near 50 percent price rally from its April 1 low near $4,000 is accompanied by a rise in the dominance rate from 50 percent to the current 57.14 percent.  That essentially means the alternative cryptocurrencies have partly decoupled from BTC as investors buy to hold.  This is evident from the fact that the BTC-denominated exchange rates of major altcoins like XRP, cardano (ADA), tron (TRX), dash (DASH), NEO (NEO), zcash (ZEC) and others have hit 2019 lows this week.  Had the dominance rate stayed put, the recent rally could have qualified as a speculative bubble, i.e. investors rotating money out of BTC and into cheap altcoins in a bid to make a quick profit.  Such price gains are often short-lived, as seen in the chart below.  Bitcoin price/dominance rate comparison (April–May 2018)  BTC rallied from lows near $6,500 in early April 2018 to $10,000 by early March. During the same time frame, its dominance rate dropped from 45 to 35 percent. That divergence did not bode well for the price, which ended up falling to $5,800 by the end of June. Other corrective rallies seen in 2018 also lacked support from the dominance rate.  Bitcoin price/dominance rate comparison (2017)  A flow toward bitcoin is usually seen at the start of the bull run, as seen in the chart above. For instance, the dominance rate rose from 38 percent to 66.5 percent in the second half of 2017 when prices went from $1,700 to $20,000.  As a result, the recent rise in the dominance rate could be considered a confirmation of a new bull market. A number of technical studies have also echoed similar sentiments over the last few weeks.  BTC, therefore, could extend the rally toward $6,544 (Nov. 7 high), although a temporary pullback cannot be ruled out if the immediate resistance band of $6,055–$6,100 proves a tough nut to crack in the next day or two.  Daily chart  The above chart shows, BTC closed above the June 2018 low of $5,780 on Wednesday, invalidating the bearish candle created on a preceding day and establishing another bullish higher high above $6,000.  As of writing, however, the cryptocurrency is struggling to beat the resistance band of $6,055–$6,100. The cryptocurrency had clocked multiple daily lows in that range in September and October 2018. A break higher would further strengthen the bullish case, opening doors to $6,500.  Repeated failure at that resistance zone would validate an overbought reading on the relative strength index and allow a pullback to the ascending 10-day moving average (MA), currently at $5,633.  The bullish case would further weaken if prices find acceptance below the 30-day MA, currently at $5,365. However, the average has consistently reversed pullbacks since March and may hold ground again, given the long duration charts are biased bullish.

Medici Bank, ""born out of frustration with the current financial services landscape,” aims to offer faster, cheaper and more transparent services, according to an announcement Wednesday. Notably, the new institution will serve cryptocurrency firms, as well as other more traditional clients such as family offices.  Lorenzo de’ Medici founded the bank alongside Ed Boyle, who was previously managing director of Americas at Fidor Bank and vice president and general manager of American Express' prepaid card business before that. Boyle is now serving as the CEO of Medici Bank, while de’ Medici takes the role of director.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Boyle said the bank has obtained an International Financial Entity (IFE) license from Puerto Rico’s Office of the Commission of Financial Institutions. He added that the bank is not seeking a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) charter in the U.S. since that is ""not highly relevant for corporate or family office customers with very large deposits.""  Although Medici Bank is willing to serve cryptocurrency businesses that comply with due diligence and know-your-customer processes, it is not an exclusive focus of the bank, according to Boyle.  De’ Medici said in the announcement:  “The original Medici Bank of Florence, founded by my family in the 14th century, revolutionized the world’s economy. Many of their innovations that drove the development of international commerce — like holding companies, double-entry bookkeeping, and letters of credit — are still in use.”  “The Medici Bank of today will be a reawakening of that innovative spirit; we are re-imagining modern-day banking by leveraging technology that creates seamless, digital customer experiences and expands financial opportunity across global markets,” he added.

Harris also talked about some possible applications of the bank’s prototype cryptocurrency, JPM Coin, in an interview with CoinDesk.      JPMorgan Chase has quietly replaced the guts of its blockchain.  Over the last six months, technologists spread across London, Singapore and the U.S. have “rebooted” Quorum, the megabank’s private version of the ethereum blockchain, said Oli Harris, JPM’s head of Quorum and crypto-assets strategy.  Specifically, the team replaced Constellation, Quorum’s privacy layer written in the Haskell computer language, with Tessera, which has a similar design, but is built in Java to make it easier for businesses to use and deploy.  This nitty-gritty effort was happening behind the scenes while the bank was out grabbing headlines with JPM Coin. But the work on Quorum’s privacy architecture is arguably as important as that internal prototype of a private cryptocurrency for clients.  For, like JPMorgan’s partnership with the Microsoft Azure Blockchain service announced last week, the reboot was designed to make Quorum usable by a larger universe of firms. And that broadening of the platform’s appeal, in turn, is helping to get Quorum ready for a possible life beyond the bank, which has been considering a spin-off of the project since early 2018.  Referring specifically to the Microsoft tie-up, Harris told CoinDesk:  “I would think of this as a stepping stone to a potential spin-out.”  “It’s open source software, available on Github and maintained by JPMorgan on behalf of everyone using Quorum,” Harris went on to explain. “The more users of Quorum, the better it is for everyone, because we can help with standardization and creating even more robust tech suite.”  Heavy lifting  Stepping back, Quorum was launched in early 2017, whereby the tech created an instant frisson of excitement by officially connecting the bank with ethereum (albeit a private version) and also adding an ambitious dose of blockchain privacy via zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs).  Following blockchain program lead Amber Baldet’s departure from the bank in April 2018, there was a brief period when Quorum’s future looked uncertain. A victim of its own success to some degree, questions arose over how the bank was going to carry out its new and unplanned role as maintainer of a growing open source project running nascent technology.  While Harris and two other sources at JPMorgan said the bank continues to mull a spin-out, it seems these concerns are now being addressed regardless.  In addition to “all the go-to-market support, which is about getting new customers using Quorum” that JPMorgan and Microsoft are working on together, Harris said the two firms’ engineers are now collaborating, streamlining node deployment and abstracting away raw complexity.  This is being done “so that companies like JPMorgan can actually focus on the business applications and unlocking value from the technology, whereas Quorum powered by Microsoft will be dealing with a lot of the heavy lifting,” he said.  Further to that end, Harris said that in the same way a user can currently pick and choose which consensus mechanism to deploy with Quorum (Istanbul, Raft etc), an easy to apply, modular “menu” of privacy solutions will be available.  As such, JPMorgan is looking at a wide range of privacy tech with different use cases in mind, noted Harris, mentioning the likes of ZKP specialists U.K.-based Aztec, which uses a more efficient variety of zero-knowledge proofs called range proofs and has a focus on bridging the gap between public and private blockchains.  JPM Coin and beyond  A number of interesting projects are running on Quorum today, such as energy commodity trading platform Vakt; trade finance blockchain Komgo; and the super-cool provenance tracking system Aura for luxury brand conglomerate LVMH.  However, the news of late has all been about stuff inside the bank. Foremost among them is JPM Coin, which is essentially tokenized cash on the Quorum ledger.  In addition to that, JPMorgan has also attracted some 220 banks to join its Interbank Information Network, which also uses Quorum to eradicate pain points in the way information circulates within foreign correspondent banking.  An obvious question concerns potential cross-pollination between the bank’s internal projects and other applications on Quorum. For example, where and when might JPM Coin begin to settle the cash part of securities transactions, or potentially be used for interbank payments and so on.  Harris, a former Accenture consultant who previously ran JPMorgan's fintech and InResidence incubator program, said part of his job is “to look at this whole ecosystem holistically” and identify where projects within the bank that run on Quorum can intermingle.  “If you think through JPM Coin as the ability to tokenize fiat currency, with the support and all the discipline and rigor and legal and compliance behind one of the world's largest banks, I think you can see us using JPM Coin in certain use cases,” he said.  Harris pointed to Dromaius, a debt issuance platform on Quorum, launched by Christine Moy, head of JPMorgan’s Blockchain Centre of Excellence at Consensus last year.  “I think Dromaius is a good one,” said Harris. “So if you are doing delivery versus payment, ie you issue the debt on the blockchain and then you also exchange the cash on the same chain, then you are just getting further benefits of the blockchain technology, because you can actually do things on the same chain, and you don't need to settle the asset in the traditional rails.”  The same applies where you can exchange one currency for another simultaneously on the same chain, said Harris, “or anywhere you need to have tokenized fiat, like a dollar on the blockchain.”  Ahead in the cloud  The combination of blockchain and cloud computing, known as blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS), has become a competitive space, with Amazon Web Service recently announcing its Managed Blockchain service, IBM pushing its Bluemix cloud platform alongside its Hyperledger Fabric blockchain.  Harris said Quorum will naturally be multi-cloud, meaning not Azure-exclusive, though obviously the expectation is Quorum customers will opt for Azure given all the integration work that’s been done. Still, the tech can be supported on-premises in banks as well as on every public cloud provider and in hybrid situations.  Indeed, he said cloud computing provides a good analogy with blockchain. The way cloud in general is playing out, is how Harris envisages the evolution of permissioned ledgers versus public blockchains and interoperability between them.  His prediction is that “mesh of blockchains” will co-exist together for different use cases and companies will then be able to decide what they want to use for the specific problem they are trying to solve.  “I don’t feel it’s going to be a binary outcome where we are just waiting for people to solve certain technical issues, whether that’s performance in public ethereum, and then everyone is going to move over to the public space.”  In the meantime, being a pillar of enterprise ethereum comes with some responsibility to help in establishing standards, specifications and interoperability further down the road. This is shown in Quorum’s commitment to the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance and, in a recent example, the Microsoft-led token taxonomy initiative, Harris pointed out.  He concluded:  “This is all about network effects. We see Quorum as this evolving technology suite and are extremely lucky to have one leg in public ethereum and also one leg in large enterprises, now powered by JPMorgan and Microsoft in a coherent way.”  JPMorgan Chase pic via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/05/09/jpmorgan-quietly-reboots-the-blockchain-behind-its-jpm-coin-cryptocurrency,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/99dca2c8b98e46165a85500db1db55b93c02268f-1500x936.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In an updated policy announced on May 8, the social media firm said ads involving blockchain technology, industry news, educational content or events related to cryptocurrency will no longer require prior written approval.  However, Facebook added it will continue to ban ads related to token sales or initial coin offerings (ICOs), which come under a list of its prohibited products.  Other ads that promote cryptocurrency and closely related products, like cryptocurrency exchanges and mining software and hardware still need to go through a review process to obtain permission to go live on Facebook.  “This process will continue to take into account licenses they have obtained, whether they are traded on a public stock exchange (or are a subsidiary of a public company) and other relevant public background on their business,” Facebook said.  The company– which has 2.38 billion active monthly users as of March 31, 2019 – initially banned ads involving bitcoin and ICOs in January of last year. Later, in June, the company eased its ban somewhat, allowing certain types of companies to get their ads on the platform with prior permission.  The latest policy update comes amid reports that the company is working on its own fiat-backed cryptocurrency or stablecoin. Facebook is said to be in talks with firms, including Visa and MasterCard, to support and fund the planned $1 billion stablecoin project dubbed ""Libra"".  The project is aimed at the development of a cryptocurrency enabling the firm’s billions of users to send money to each other, as well as make online purchases.

42381869,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pyQr,1557374415,Florincoin – The 2013 Altcoin You Don't Remember – Is Attracting Real Users,"One of the most recognizable names in the crypto space (and perhaps even outside of it) is using one of the least recognizable blockchains.  Overstock.com subsidiaries Medici Ventures and tZERO have been utilizing the FLO blockchain for some time in work aimed at re-organizing property rights. At one time, a video of the tZERO homepage even showed the little-known blockchain at work.  Still, if you haven't heard of FLO before, you won't be alone. Maybe Florincoin, the blockchain's moniker when it first launched in 2013, shortly before the 2014 altcoin boom – will ring a bell, at least those who were in New York at the time.  Joey Fiscella was a staple in the growing New York City crypto community during that area. A young, extroverted programmer, he had the ability to schmooze with the best of the business types. While the rest of the scene was focused on bitcoin, to a certain extent litecoin and for the lolz dogecoin, Fiscella was instead always talking Florincoin – a coin that's visage bears a golden fleur-de-lis.  He was a regular at the New York Bitcoin Center and was always handing out thin strips of paper with Florincoin private keys (I used to have one, but as is the nature of small scraps of paper, it has been lost).  The idea was simple: Florincoin was bitcoin but with additional room for transaction comments, 140 characters at that time. And those characters would allow a decentralized social media (what else had a 140-character limit back then? Twitter), one that couldn't be censored or stopped.  It's a dream that's still being toyed with today – from Steemit to Peepeth to Minds – but since then Florincoin, now FLO, has moved on.  Today, most of the developers and businesses involved in FLO are interested in it as an indexing tool, something that could provide the backbone of a blockchain-based Google.  Not only has Medici Land Governance begun adding property records on the FLO blockchain (and partnered with the state of Wyoming, the city of Tulum in Mexico and a government official in Zambia), but tZERO is adding digital locate receipts, which locate the ownership of a stock, into FLO to mitigate naked short selling.  On top of that, FLO is being utilized by the Open Index Protocol (OIP), a database for decentralized publishing of all kinds, and an app on top of OIP called Alexandria, which allows users to search and browse info in that database.  The list of users goes on too.  The California Institute of Technology, also called Caltech, uses FLO to store more than 17,000 records of information gathered with microscopes, and just recently announced the creation of another repository of microscope data.  So how, a crypto enthusiast might ask, did FLO become a blockchain with actual users (and seemingly without gloating in the hopes of sparking a price pump)?  According to Chris Chrysostom, a senior software developer at Medici Ventures, ""As a developer I'm always open to looking at other solutions; people mention bitcoin a lot because right now it's a good starting point for communicating concepts.""  But, he continued:  ""One thing that FLO provides that bitcoin doesn't is, right now, it has the ability to accept 1,040 bytes of metadata. FLO is able and willing to take on the blockchain bloat that many people are critical of in bitcoin.""  The bytes and the bloat  To understand how one of the most-anticipated and regulated token projects in the space came to use a blockchain that most people don't even know about, you have to start with its first real business case.  Utilized by husband and wife team, Devon and Amy James, Florincoin became the underlying technology of the Decentralized Library of Alexandria (DLOA).  A blatant nod to the ancient world library that was burned down (while it's become a modern-day symbol for the loss of cultural knowledge, the crypto project used it as a way to illustrate the problems inherent to centralization), the project was initially touted as a decentralized library. According to Amy, the co-founder of the project, in an earlier interview, all types of content, including books, blogs, video, audio and art could be added to the blockchain and secured from censorship.  DLOA was the forefather of today's decentralized content platforms, hoping to untangle the messy distribution models that currently exist for content creators and viewers online.  The project chugged along for a couple of years quietly, until Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web and the founder of the W3C, a standards organization for the web, was given a demo of the app.  According to Amy, Berners-Lee loved it, but said: ""change the name.""  So the application – a Google-like search for the data, became just Alexandria and the protocol, which allows content creators to decide how their content is categorized before adding it to the FLO blockchain, became known as the Open Index Protocol (OIP).  And as that change happened, the number of bytes that could be stored in a transaction was increased as well – from 140 to 528 and then to 1,040, the limit today. But what's perhaps the most fascinating about OIP is that in a mess of new competition, the project has stuck with FLO.  From Storj to Filecoin or even more broadly ethereum or EOS, there's a slew of blockchain projects looking to tackle a similar use case – decentralized file storage – and these new players tout advanced architecture that makes their platforms faster, stronger, overall better.  But Devon remains unphased by the shiny new toys.  ""When we started the project, our goal was to build a shared data layer that is censorship-proof, persistent and as interoperable as possible,"" he told CoinDesk. ""This required certain technical choices, which FLO fit perfectly – and even though other things have been launched since which do a variety of things, they don’t meet those needs better than FLO does.""  For that index that OIP is, Devon contends, the project needs full global state replication (to make censorship attempts transparent), proof-of-work consensus (to make censorship attempts expensive and defensible) and the ability to directly benefit from bitcoin's developer community (a fork of bitcoin).  According to Devon, sure, OIP could instead store its index on ethereum, and with that gain a different developer community and plenty of hype.  But, he said, the project would lose in other ways. For instance, after sharding is implemented, the project wouldn't any longer get full global state replication; and after Casper – ethereum's switch to a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm – the project wouldn't have the security of proof-of-work.  On top of that, the publishing fees would no longer be decided by the OIP working group, and would instead, entirely be a function of the gas costs – priced by the ethereum core developers – of certain operations.  For many intents and purposes, FLO has become a kind of single purpose blockchain specifically for OIP. And that wasn't a bad thing for FLO. While other institutions are starting to use FLO now, for many years Devon and Amy James were the only ones really focused on FLO and they brought in a significant number of the developers that work on the blockchain to this day.  The original angel  Take Sky Young, a senior full stack developer at Alexandria.io, who started working on the FLO protocol because of her role with Alexandria in August 2015.  Or Jeremiah Buddenhagen, also known as bitspill, who began developing on the FLO blockchain after he completed and claimed a bounty posted by the Alexandria team to update the protocol. After that, Buddenhagen told CoinDesk, Alexandria offered him contract work until hiring him as a full stack developer in the summer of 2017.  Both developers get paid to work on OIP, which many times involves the development of FLO, keeping the blockchain up-to-date, probably more so than it would be were there not a company so tied into its success.  Before OIP and Alexandria, there was only FLO's (then Florincoin's), creator, a pseudonymous developer going by the moniker SkyAngel. It's pretty similar to bitcoin's Satoshi Nakamoto, although SkyAngel remains around here and there, said Fiscella.  SkyAngel did not return requests for comment.  In June 2013, Fiscella was trolling crypto forums looking for altcoins to mine and stumbled on FLO – hours after the software was released, he began mining the cryptocurrency and after noticing a couple of bugs (nothing consensus-related) in the code, he contacted SkyAngel within a week of its release. He's been volunteering his time towards development ever since.  And while Fiscella got his fair share of shit for messing around with FLO – this was back in the day when people thought all altcoins were useless or worse, scams – there's a sense of pride now.  ""FLO is one of the oldest altcoins that is still actively traded and developed,"" he told CoinDesk.  And it's done so, he continued, without a pre-mine for developers, without raising huge amounts of money in an initial coin offering (ICO), without even a million dollars from a venture capitalist. Although, the FLO developers have raised $50,000 from the community over the past six years and the OIP and Alexandria team have raised a few $100,000 here and there, which they used to continue FLO development.  As such, many of the developers working on FLO right now are also pretty happy with the way it's all turned out.  For instance, Young describes FLO as ""hidden"" and ""undervalued."" And although Buddenhagen was initially only attracted to FLO as a way to make money from small programming gigs, his ""appreciation and understanding"" has grown significantly over the years.  He told CoinDesk, ""The big idea that made me want to keep working on this project is the idea of building a public space – allowing users to determine the worth of their own work and for the consumers to determine if it's appropriate (rather than being held to the mercy of rates decided by a private company or a vague definition of 'advertiser friendly').""  In describing my story, meeting Fiscella years later at a crypto meetup and thinking, 'Holy shit, Florincoin still exists,' Buddenhagen, who's been in the space since 2013, laughed, saying:  ""It's great to see people react when they re-discover that FLO/Alexandria have not joined the ranks of shitcoin yet nor is it merely idling on but has actually grown in the shadows.""  Enter tZERO  It was Chris Chrysostom, a developer that was looking to build a simple application called a bill of sale on a blockchain, that found FLO and eventually brought it into the Medici ranks.  While he began the project hoping to utilize bitcoin's OP_RETURN feature, Chrysostom quickly became frustrated with that because cumbersome to use and doesn't hold enough data to create anything substantial. So he started looking around, reading through some content about Factom and the Storj white papers, both of which mention FLO (again Florincoin at that time).  That led Chrysostom to Alexandria, where he worked alongside Devon and Amy, building out the project's payment capabilities.  Then in July 2017, he was picked up by Medici Ventures.  Now a senior software developer at the venture capital subsidiary of Overstock.com, Chrysostom brought to the job his interest in FLO. Chrysostom was assigned to a project within Medici Ventures focused on property rights – the idea being a global property rights registry – and FLO and the work being done by the Open Index Protocol seemed like a natural fit there, he told CoinDesk.  ""We use it specifically for projects, proofs-of-concept and research for this property rights project,"" he said.  While Patrick Byrne, the founder and CEO of Overstock, announced a partnership in late 2017 with Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto with a similar intent, Chrysostom said his work using FLO at Medici Ventures was different, yet could easily support the De Soto project if necessary.  According to Chrysostom, he was looking for a proof-of-work blockchain with similarities to bitcoin, so many similarities that the development work on bitcoin's core team could then be applied to the other blockchain as well. For instance, security measures and scaling technologies like Segregated Witness.  ""FLO was really appealing – bitcoin wants its use case to be focused on value transfer (and that's fine); FLO has taken it upon itself to have a lot of similarities to bitcoin but with the added feature of application data,"" Chrysostom said. ""Which is more suited for the property rights use case.""  And sure enough, Chrysostom has similar things to say about the project's ethos and morals.  ""It's really appealing that FLO hasn't gone down the path of turning itself into an ICO; it didn't try to segregate coins in a certain way, like the staking mechanisms; it's quite admirable that it has remained an open-source project,"" he said, adding:  ""Four to five years have gone by, and it's still about what its founding was all about – an open blockchain with a little extra use case. I just find it admirable that it's stuck to that.""  And as for OIP and Alexandria, those teams get Chrysostom's praise too since, according to him, they focused on building out the software instead of hyping the coin.  Chrysostom said:  ""FLO has been quite the stealth coin in my opinion.""  While Chrysostom would, of course, love to see the developers and projects building on FLO get rewarded for their work, he understands that with investment comes responsibilities that might divert the focus away from the open index goal.  For Medici Ventures part, it does not provide investment to FLO developers, Chrysostom explained, although he continued, ""If the day comes that someone wants to make a pitch to Medici Ventures … I think they'd listen. They listen to all kinds of things.""  Keeping it afloat  Still, that's not to say everything has run smoothly in the FLO community.  For instance, toward the end of 2015, customers of Cryptsy, the only digital currency exchange that listed FLO, began having withdrawal issues, and shortly after the exchange claimed it was insolvent after a July 2014 hack.  While a class action was mounted at Cryptsy in the aftermath, the parties that brought the class action against the exchange didn't list FLO as one of the coins you could redeem. According to Fiscella, there are 11.5 million FLO coins in one Cryptsy wallet that haven't moved since February 2014, so he suspects not that the exchange's founders ran away with the coins (because then they probably would have sold them off at some point) but that these coins could not be recovered by any party, the exchange or even law enforcement.  ""It wasn't worth anything at the time,"" Fiscella said. ""But FLO was once around 40 cents.""  At that price, the coins lost in Cryptsy would have been worth more than $4 million.  Since then Bittrex and Poloniex have also listed FLO (actually on the same day in March 2015), although Poloniex removed it shortly after the exchange was acquired by Circle. Poloniex didn't give a reason for the delisting of FLO, though the coin was taken off the site with a handful of other altcoins.  While some thought the reason was low volume, Fiscella argues that other coins that were not delisted had lower volume than FLO, so really he speculates the delisting was about FLO's low hashrate, which meant that FLO could be relatively easily 51% attacked.  This was right around the same time that Crypto 51, a website calculating the cost of 51% attacking (and then double spending) cryptocurrencies, appeared. Once that website was up, a number of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin gold and vertcoin, began dealing with attacks.  And FLO, which was on the Crypto51 list with an attack price of only $300, was exploited on Bittrex in September 2018 and 25 bitcoins were stolen. The attack works like this: an anonymous account deposited hundreds of thousands of FLO coins into Bittrex, traded that FLO for the 25 bitcoins, withdrew the 25 bitcoins and then rewrote about 480 FLO blocks. In this way, the FLO deposit was reversed and the hacker was able to reclaim the hundreds of thousands of FLO they had initially deposited and was also out with the bitcoin as well. The wallet at the exchange then didn't have the FLO to deposit into the accounts that had bought the altcoin.  When Bittrex's system detected this, it shut down FLO trading for about a month, until the developers fixed the issue.  ""And by fixed it, I mean we paid 700,000 FLO to Bittrex,"" Fiscella said, adding:  ""And by we, I mean me.""  Bittrex did not respond to requests for inquiry.  Joey used the FLO he had been mining since the beginning to pay back the exchange and other FLO developers set up a ""Big Mac Fund"" for Joey, where community members have donated about half of the 700,000 to Joey for his ongoing work on the protocol.  Before the attack happened, Fiscella had been discussing the issue with Devon and Amy James, saying they needed to increase the hash rate before something like this happened. But it was too little, too late.  After the attack, the developers working on the protocol decided that FLO needed to add some additional security measures to the scrypt-based mining algorithm (an alternative to bitcoin's SHA-256 algorithm) since scrypt-based mining made it easier for an attack to take place.  The developers decided to add an extra rule to the consensus algorithm, a so-called max reorg depth limit feature. This feature requires large reorganizations of the blockchain be rejected, and it's a similar feature to that used by bitcoin cash and ravencoin.  If that sounds like something that could kill a cryptocurrency, make people so skeptical of its security and value that they sell off their bags and leave it to die, it's definitely happened before.  But FLO has endured and actually, it's developers learned from its mistakes and evolved.  ""The people who have joined have not asked to be paid, they're just activists or investors,"" Fiscella told CoinDesk, adding: ""Everyone joined organically and they're using their skills and network to grow the community. I think that's really important.""  Today, there are about 10 active mining pools and another 10 that sometimes mine FLO, which increases the robustness of the coin. Also in early 2018, FLO's code was updated to Segregated Witness, a protocol change that adjusts the way data is stored, making blockchains more scalable.  Echoing Fiscella's comments about FLO being successful because of its determined developer community, Buddenhagen concluded:  ""They all appear to know what they're doing and why they're here putting in the effort whenever/wherever life/work allows the opportunity being that it's a side project and volunteerism keeping it going, perhaps slowly at times but always moving forward with dedication and purpose.""

42381867,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pyOL,1557365649,"Above $6,000: Bitcoin’s Price Spikes to 6-Month High","Bitcoin's price rose above $6,000 on most cryptocurrency exchanges for the first time today in nearly six months.  At 00:57 UTC on Thursday, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which accounts for more than half of all other cryptocurrencies combined, picked up a bid and saw its price reach as high as $6,076 – its highest price since Nov. 14, 2018.  At the time of writing, bitcoin’s surge has slightly cooled off, now trading across exchanges at an average price of $6,045, according to CoinDesk’s price data.  In another first since last November, bitcoin’s market capitalization rose above $100 billion, $1.45 billion or 1.39 percent of which entered the market in the last 24 hours.  Further still, bitcoin's dominance rate, a measure of its market share versus that of other cryptocurrencies, hit its highest point in nearly eight months at 56.8 percent - its biggest reading since Sept. 13, 2018, based on data from CoinMarketCap.  According to data from Messari.io, bitcoin's total trading volume across exchanges today exceeded $15.5 billion, yet its ""Real 10"" volume - a metric that takes into account trading volume from the only 10 exchanges reporting honest volume figures as identified in a report by Bitwise Asset Management - reveals a seemingly more accurate 24-hour volume figure may be closer to $502 million.  When bitcoin's price moves emphatically in a particular direction, the U.S. dollar value of most other cryptocurrencies tends to follow suit, and the developments today were no exception.  Other highly ranked cryptos in terms of market cap like Ether (ETH), EOS (EOS), and Cardano (ADA) are all reporting 24-hour gains above two percent, while bitcoin is leading the top 10 cryptocurrencies, currently boasting an increase of 3.64 percent.  Overall the total capitalization of the cryptocurrency market increased roughly by $5.4 billion during today’s rally to where it now stands now at a value of $189.1 billion. Indeed, the value of the broader market is making substantial progress in recouping the losses endured throughout 2018, but is still down 78.1 percent from its all-time high of $835 billion recorded on January 7, 2018.
