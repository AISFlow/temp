42432624,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO0Qxh,1599606050,Arca to Gnosis: Show Us a Turnaround Plan or Give Investors' Money Back,"Hedge fund manager Arca is stepping up its campaign to overhaul Gnosis, claiming the decentralized exchange and prediction market platform has deviated from its original mission.    Over the summer, Arca discreetly asked Gnosis to make a tender offer for all circulating GNO tokens, giving investors the opportunity to cash out. Those who declined the offer should be rewarded with a 10-for-1 token split for sticking it out while Gnosis gets its house in order, according to an August slide deck outlining Arca’s proposal.    The Block reported on Arca’s proposal last week.  In a blog post published Tuesday, Arca Chief Investment Officer Jeff Dorman wrote that while his firm never intended for its feedback to Gnosis to become public, he’s glad it has generated a discussion regarding token holders’ rights. The implication is that a token issuer has an obligation to these investors to stick to the business plan for which they signed up.  The post is Arca's first public comment on the simmering tensions between the firm and Gnosis. It comes at a time when decentralized prediction markets like Gnosis are struggling to gain traction.    The post describes Gnosis’ $12.5 million 2017 token sale (which valued the project at $300 million) as an “interest-free loan.” After borrowing the money, the team “failed to deliver the products laid out in its fundraising [white paper],” Arca contends. The products Gnosis created generate value only for its management, Arca claims.    Luckily for all involved, the balance sheet has increased fivefold, as a result of ether (ETH) appreciating, leaving Gnosis with ample resources ($55 million worth of the second-largest cryptocurrency and $10 million of cash) to repay investors, Arca said.  Dorman wrote that Arca often works with management teams throughout the lifecycle of an investment to achieve the goals of the community, which he described as a typically productive and mutually beneficial process. This was not the case with Gnosis, however.  “Despite our constructive engagement, Gnosis did not take any necessary steps to remedy issues we’ve uncovered throughout our continuous due diligence and research process,” wrote Dorman. “In fact, the very first time we heard of ANY steps indicating that Gnosis is willing to remedy the issues we uncovered was as a promissory quote in the Block article, where [Gnosis founder Martin] Köppelmann commented on redoing the tokenomics of the GNO token”    In that article, Köppelmann is quoted as saying Gnosis “had already been working on an alternative path for the GNO token, which we think is much more appealing. Our own proposal includes a Gnosis DAO and gives much more ownership to GNO holders. It will be presented to the community very soon.""    To Dorman’s mind, that quote suggested that Gnosis was open to the idea of changing its setup to better align with token holders, but was strident about what steps needed to be taken.  “Token holders like us should not have to beg a company to disseminate a plan, nor should we have to continue to wait for promises with no details,” wrote Dorman. “For this so-called plan Mr. Köppelmann alludes to, give us a date, give us an outline, give us specific details so that the Gnosis community has the chance to provide feedback.”  Lacking that specific feedback, Dorman stood behind Arca’s call in the slide deck for Gnosis to repay its “loan” by tendering for outstanding tokens “at the book value of its balance sheet (ETH + USD), which at current ETH prices would return over $74 per GNO token to token holders and Gnosis employees, even after reserving a generous amount of runway so that Gnosis can continue to run their business uninterrupted.”  If all holders of the 460,000 tokens in circulation took such an offer, the payout would total $34 million. And if all the money Gnosis has on hand were returned to investors, it would come to $140 per token, or $65 million, according to Arca. Either deal would handily beat the $46.46 level GNO currently trades at on the open market.    Attempts to reach Gnosis for comment Tuesday were unsuccessful.      Big picture: The situation suggests that in addition to cash and cachet, institutions are bringing activist investing strategies to crypto.    DigixDAO, an early initial coin coin offering (ICO) that faced a situation where its treasury was more than its market cap, faced similar activist investor behavior when it offered a question to the community – dissolve the treasury or continue making grants?  In Wall Street parlance, a tender offer is a public solicitation to all shareholders requesting they tender their stock for sale at a specific price during a certain time. The investor normally offers a higher price per share than the company's stock price, providing shareholders a greater incentive to sell their shares. Arca is adapting this concept to the crypto world.  Activist investors buy up large shareholdings in companies to acquire board seats and agitate for management and strategic changes. They have become a staple of Wall Street over the last decade, ballooning from $12 billion under management in 2003 to the activist asset class topping $112 billion by 2014.

42432631,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO0RFh,1599598657,Crypto Investors Have Ignored Three Straight 51% Attacks on ETC,"Despite three “51% attacks” in a month, Ethereum Classic’s price has demonstrated strong resilience. Though down a bit for the past month, its persistence may indicate that security is not a top priority for investors rushing to join a bull run in the crypto market.      However, some warn that unless it improves its blockchain and makes it safer, additional attacks on Ethereum Classic could trigger a market sell-off and lead to a collapse of its digital asset.      For a blockchain network’s security, a “51% attack” is pretty much as bad as it gets. That’s when a single entity gains control of a majority of the network’s computing power, allowing it to siphon off extra units of the currency in what’s known as a double-spend.      So it would stand to reason that three successful 51% attacks in a month against the Ethereum Classic blockchain might dent investors’ confidence. But prices for the project’s native ETC token haven’t really taken a hit – a sign traders could be less concerned about security vulnerabilities than a quick profit in fast-moving cryptocurrency markets.      At press time, ethereum classic is trading at $5.06, down about 27% in the past 30 days at the same time bitcoin is off by 15%.      Three 51% attacks in a month      For the Ethereum Classic blockchain, 51% attacks have been a threat for a long time. Unlike Ethereum, from which it was hard forked, the Ethereum Classic network is committed to the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm, which is also used by BItcoin. But for large networks like Bitcoin, a 51% attack is prohibitively expensive to do given the enormous amount of computational power required by PoW to successfully do it. Ethereum Classic’s hashrate is much smaller, making it far more vulnerable to 51% attacks.      By press time, the hashrate of Ethereum Classic stood at 1.668 terahash per second, while Bitcoin’s at 117.95 exashes per second, according to BitInfoCharts.      Ethereum Classic is the product of a hard fork after the Ethereum network split in different ways following an infamous hack in 2016. The PoW-based blockchain has been chasing after Ethereum, which now represents the No.2 cryptocurrency by market capitalization.      Ethereum is planning on changing its algorithm sometime next year. In a tweet thread Sept. 2, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin argued Ethereum’s planned Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithm gives it a “key fundamental” advantage over PoW.      “In PoW, on the other hand, a successful attacker can just attack over and over again, with no possible way to delete their hardware without deleting everyone else's hardware.”      During the month of August, the Ethereum Classic network suffered not one but three 51% attacks: the first one took place on Aug. 1,the second on Aug. 6 and a third on Aug. 29.      NiceHash, a hashpower broker, acknowledged its platform may have facilitated the recent 51% attacks, in a blog post on Sept. 1, but it also concluded that such attacks cannot be prevented or mitigated in a ""truly decentralized proof-of-work solution.""      ""The only thing one can do is make the price of an attack higher than the attacker reward,"" the post added.      The Ethereum Classic network also suffered a 51% attack in early 2019, which led crypto exchange Coinbase to halt all ETC transactions, withdrawals and deposits at the time.      James Wo, founder of ETC Labs, the leading organization supporting the Ethereum Classic network, told CoinDesk via a spokesperson that his team has been trying to enhance the network’s security in the past year, including expanding the network’s core development team, and partnering with companies such as Chainlink, Swarm and Bloq.      The company announced two new hires on Sept. 3 to ETC’s core development team.      “These developments and partnerships are working to quickly propel the advancement of ETC and ensure a bright future for the network,” Wo said, who added that ETC’s price has held “strong” even with the recent 51% attacks.      Indeed, the attacks have not had any significant impact on its prices, which prompted a question: why would anyone put money in a token when its security is not guaranteed?    An unattractive gift    A large percentage of ETC holders received their tokens involuntarily after the Ethereum chain split and, as a result, the price of ETC has remained stable over the past few years simply because many ETC holders have ignored taking any actions.      “Many people are just sort of sitting on it and maybe not necessarily thinking about trading [ETC] or not necessarily actively monitoring their transition,” Meltem Demirors, the chief strategy officer at CoinShares, said in a phone interview with CoinDesk. “Because a lot of people who hold assets from a fork don’t really have any incentive to sell them unless the value goes up dramatically.”      Citing the fact that a large number of Ethereum Classic wallets have been inactive, Demirors said some ETC holders may not see the value of selling or even claiming their ETC.      “I don’t know how motivated they are to actually try to sell or try to move their assets to a wallet or on an exchange,” she said. “A lot of people just don’t think it’s worth the effort and energy.”    Similar to DeFi    Ethereum Classic’s price resilience during these attacks tells the story that the majority of crypto investors right now are more focused on “short-term” price momentum trades than “long-term” chain security and fundamentals, according to John Todaro, director of institutional research at the cryptocurrency analysis firm TradeBlock.      “Price momentum in the space has accelerated recently and security concerns are being pushed aside to an extent,” he told CoinDesk via email. “While Ethereum Classic has legitimate long-term concerns given the recent 51% reorg attacks, we have not seen heightened capital outflows from ETC.”      That is in line with the red hot decentralized finance (DeFi) world where capital continues to be allocated despite warnings of high risks with certain yield farming smart contracts.      “You see people putting billions of dollars of their digital assets into unaudited smart contracts, right now I’m not sure people are really so concerned about security,” Demirors said.      And as long as the market remains in bull mode, it is likely that traders will compromise their security concerns for higher returns – until that security problem becomes big enough to trigger a collapse of the entire system.      In the DeFi world, that problem could be a few smart contract bugs. In Ethereum Classic, it could be a large-scale dump of the token as a result of any additional 51% attacks, Todaro warned.      That is not entirely impossible: After the first two attacks in August, crypto exchanges contemplated or else took drastic measures which would make ETC less accessible and attractive to investors. OKEx said that it will consider delisting the asset, and Coinbase extended deposit and withdrawal confirmation times for ETC to around two weeks.      “I think the big mover will be exchanges delisting Ethereum Classic and there are no longer any venues where you can trade it easily,” Demirors said. “I think then you may see people say ‘ok, maybe I should take my Ethereum Classic and liquidate it before it becomes impossible to do so.’”    Grayscale's role    While some have attributed crypto financial giant Grayscale’s position on ETC to its relatively stable pricing, the company refused to admit its influence on ETC’s trading.      “It would be very difficult for us to comment or point to our operating a vehicle around a particular protocol as being influential to the prices,” Michael Sonneshein, managing director of Grayscale, said in a phone interview with CoinDesk, pointing out his company also has large positions in bitcoin and ether. Grayscale, like CoinDesk, is a unit of Digital Currency Group.      But according to Demirors, there are only a “small” number of financial investment firms – Grayscale included – involved in this digital asset, making it natural that Grayscale is in the spotlight when it comes to Ethereum Classic.      “[Grayscale] holds a sizable percentage of the circulating supply in Ethereum Classic, which is locked up in the trust that will never be liquidated,” she said. “So I think some of those natural factors, which can drain the supply of Ethereum Classic on the market, have a dampening impact on the price.”    As of July 31, 2020, Grayscale’s Ethereum Classic trust had $86.4 million of assets under managementhttps://grayscale.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ETC-Trust-Fact-Sheet-August-2020.pdf. That was equal to about 10% of Ethereum Classic’s market cap of $861.7 million on that date. As of press time, total market cap was down to $619.8 million.    The recent 51% attacks on the Ethereum Classic network also have not led to any additional questions or worries from Grayscale’s clients on this crypto asset, according to Grayscale’s Sonneshein.

Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $10,014 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 1.1% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $9,920-$10,439  BTC below its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bearish signal for market technicians.    Scant action in the bitcoin market over the weekend was a welcome respite from the downward trend since the start of September, when prices hit as high as $12,083 on spot exchanges such as Coinbase.

Rupert Douglas, head of institutional sales for crypto brokerage Koine, isn’t ruling out a further drop. “It's tough right now to say how far BTC retraces,” he told CoinDesk. “My concern is around equities, where I believe tech is in a bubble not dissimilar to 2000,” he added.      The equities markets are mixed Tuesday, with some hopeful numbers out of Asia while the European and U.S. markets are tanking.    Asia’s Nikkei 225 ended the day up 0.80% as positive Chinese trade balance data boosted economic optimism in the region.  Europe’s FTSE 100 closed in the red 1% as concerns about Brexit and trade issues with the greater European Union dragged the index lower.  The United States’ S&P 500 lost 2.8% as the technology sector continues a tumble that started last week, most notably Apple descending 6.7%.    “I think we are going to see significantly lower equity prices soon, but will BTC be correlated as it was the last time when equities lurched lower in February and March? That is the question,” added Koine’s Douglas.      Over the past month, bitcoin dropped over 13% while stock indexes, aided by the tech sector and various stimulus packages by governments, have been holding up better than the bellwether cryptocurrency.      In the derivatives markets, open interest in bitcoin futures have declined to the lowest level since early July, currently around $3.7 billion.      “Bitcoin futures volumes have been lower the last few days, partly because of the U.S. Labor Day weekend, but also we reverted more towards average volume days after having some large days last week,” added Swissquote’s Thomas. Indeed, this past Tuesday, volume spiked at $5.1 billion before dropping off.      Read More: August’s Bitcoin Rally Led to Record Crypto Derivatives Volumes: Report      While bitcoin was relatively quiet over the long U.S. weekend, decentralized finance, or DeFi, again stole the show in crypto surrounding the SushiSwap project, drama that Thomas hopes can fade quickly. “To me, it’s important we just hold steady for a while and the DeFi space has a calm few weeks with no more crazy unaudited projects causing problems,” added Thomas.

Read More: What is Yield Farming? DeFi's Hot Trend, Explained      For the first time in data aggregator DeFi Pulse’s charts, the total value locked in DeFi has decreased. The amount locked surpassed $9.5 billion on Sept. 1, fell almost $2 billion by Sept. 5 and then recovered slightly.      “This is probably caused by the drop in [the] ETH price,” said Jun Yi, a Singapore-based DeFi yield farmer. “ETH dropped around 30%. There is a cascading effect,” he added.      It appears that ether holders in particular started pulling out, with over 440,000 ether “unlocked” Sept. 4-5 after a slight recovery.      On the other hand, the number of bitcoin locked in DeFi is still trending up, crossing the 80,000 BTC threshold on Tuesday.

First rolled out two months ago, the CoinDesk 20 is a list of the digital assets that matter most to the market. We filter by consistent, verifiable volume, listing the 20 assets that have the most volume on trusted exchanges for two consecutive quarters. It was initially composed of exchange volume data gathered in Q4 of 2019 and Q1 of 2020. Since the launch, we've updated the list using data from Q1 and Q2 of 2020.     Our goal with the CoinDesk 20 is to develop an objective method for filtering assets, not by their investment or speculative potential but by their currency with traders and investors. Our set of eight trusted exchanges, which provide the exchange volume data used to create the list, is conservative by design.  Orchid's price pumped in the past month, benefiting from attention from David Portnoy, a publisher and media personality. It's worth reiterating the dollar volume that put Orchid in the CoinDesk 20 preceded this pump. It's possible it came in anticipation of Orchid's mobile and desktop apps, released in July.  For investors learning about Orchid for the first time, inclusion in the CoinDesk 20 may signal it is an asset with some level of staying power in the market. Intelligent investors need that assurance before devoting time and resources to researching or trading a new asset.  In the weeks since the start of Q3, we gathered the requisite data on Orchid to populate its asset price page. There, in addition to the price graph, you'll find volume, volatility, returns and a handful of on-chain metrics designed to provide a snapshot of the asset's fundamentals, as well as CoinDesk's news reporting and video content.  We welcome your feedback on the CoinDesk 20 as a product. A detailed look at the methodology behind it is available here. Please contact CoinDesk Research with questions, comments, etc. You can reach us on research@coindesk.com.  Note: Due to a calculation error, one asset was listed incorrectly in the 2021 Q1 update to the CoinDesk 20. Cardano should have been excluded.

42432625,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO0R3h,1599589850,Banks Are Toast but Crypto Has Lost Its Soul,"Frances Coppola, a CoinDesk columnist, is a freelance writer and speaker on banking, finance and economics. Her book “The Case for People’s Quantitative Easing” explains how modern money creation and quantitative easing work, and advocates “helicopter money” to help economies out of recession.      The 2008 financial crisis created an extraordinary financial melting pot. Into the soup went the legacy system, now shown to be unfit for this purpose: new ways of transacting in old currencies and new types of money. This witches’ brew has now been stewing for over a decade, but the type of potion it will eventually produce is still unknown. Will it be a financial system fit for the digital age? Or will it simply be a souped-up version of the old system, with all its flaws and toxicity?      The immediate response to the 2008 crisis was to tie down the banks that had so nearly blown up the world. New rules were created to restrict their activities. New regulators were created to police their activities and prevent them doing anything that looked too risky. New capital and liquidity requirements were imposed on them so they were less likely to run out of money in a crisis and, if they did, less likely to need bailing out by taxpayers.      See also: Frances Coppola - Mr. Powell, If You Want Higher Inflation, Give People Money      But preventing banks from crashing the financial system and wrecking sovereign finances didn’t necessarily mean making them safer for their customers. In 2014, the government of Cyprus, egged on by the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank, imposed losses of more than 50% on uninsured bank deposits in the island’s two largest banks. The shockwave from this reverberates around the world to this day.      The financial crisis had been destructive, yes, but depositors had been protected: The U.S. government had temporarily removed the limit on FDIC deposit insurance, and governments in other countries had guaranteed all deposits in failing banks. But after the Cyprus haircuts, bank deposits were no longer safe. And it wasn’t just large deposits that were suddenly at risk. The Cypriot government originally intended to impose losses on smaller deposits – deposits that were supposedly 100% guaranteed. Fortunately, the Cypriot Parliament had the sense to refuse to pass the legislation. But what is to stop the government of another country, one with a more compliant legislature, from reneging on deposit insurance?      While European governments were busy making bank deposits less safe, central banks were preventing depositors from earning anything. Interest rates were cut to nearly zero at the time of the financial crisis. Twelve years later, they are still nearly zero. At the time of writing, the average interest rate on U.S. bank savings accounts is 0.06%. So central banks are chasing a target of 2% price inflation while keeping the return on savings at close to zero. You’re being robbed, folks.    The financial crisis was the banking equivalent of the asteroid that killed the big dinosaurs.    The effect of all this was to give impetus to new providers. The burgeoning fintech sector offered higher-yield savings accounts to bank depositors desperate for return. But even these are only offering an average yield of about 1%. If you want better than that, you have to look elsewhere.      And you don’t have far to look. The cryptocurrency marketplace offers yields of hundreds and thousands of percent for people who are willing to risk it. Freed from the regulation that prevents banks, and even new fintech providers, from taking the risks that are necessary for high returns, the cryptocurrency has become the go-to place for tech-savvy people who want to make a lot of dollars.      But in becoming a high-risk, high-yield playground for dollar investors, the cryptocurrency world sold its soul. The early adopters of Bitcoin believed it would replace the financial system that had crashed and burned so badly. And today there are still people who believe bitcoin will become the new “gold” in a global cryptocurrency system that will eventually replace the dollar for international transactions.      But most people now playing in the crypto shark pool aren’t interested in world domination. Bitcoin replacing the dollar as the global reserve currency would seriously interfere with their plans to become dollar billionaires through crypto trading. What they want is cryptocurrencies to be securely tethered to the major fiat currencies, especially the dollar, so they can be confident that when they have made their billions of notional dollars, they will be able to convert them to real ones. So now we have “stablecoins” to protect them from the extreme volatility in cryptocurrency prices that can, in a heartbeat, wipe out their notional dollar returns.  “Stablecoins” such as tether are the ropes that tie the cryptocurrency system firmly to the fiat currency system. And even though everyone knows stablecoins aren’t dollars and the guarantees provided by stablecoin issuers are no more reliable than the deposit insurance guarantees provided by governments, these ropes are getting ever stronger.      See also: Frances Coppola - The Stablecoin Surge Is Built on Smoke and Mirrors      As investors’ confidence in the dollar backing of the cryptocurrency ecosystem grows, the risks they are prepared to take in search of yield increase. “Yield farming” is all the rage. True, you might get scammed and lose your shirt – indeed as more sharks enter the pool, the likelihood of this happening is rising fast. But there will be plenty more opportunities to make megabucks.      So what began as a simple transaction system independent of the dollar has evolved into a complex ecosystem backed by billions of faux dollars in which the chances of getting defrauded are high but the returns for the lucky – or the fraudulent – are even higher. It even now features cryptocurrency versions of the toxic derivatives that trashed the global economy in 2008. Whatever Satoshi’s vision for Bitcoin was, I doubt if it was this.      Depressing though I find this digital version of the Devonian ocean, there is still hope. The bloodthirsty monsters that roamed that ocean drove some creatures onto the land, where they became the ancestors of today’s land-living vertebrates. Eventually the monsters died out, apparently because of competition from something that wasn’t even in the ocean. Their nemesis was trees, which fundamentally changed the global climate, making it impossible for them to survive.      See also: Frances Coppola - Why Bitcoin-Like Scarcity Would Be a Disaster for the Dollar      What will be the nemesis of the cryptocurrency monsters? Perhaps it could be the quiet growth of digital money transmission services. Or maybe the – now inevitable – introduction of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Perhaps some cryptocurrency providers will tether to CBDCs instead of relying on the faux dollars created by tether and its kind. It’s hard to say how this will evolve.      The death of the cryptocurrency monsters, when it comes, won’t mean the end of cryptocurrencies. When monsters die, the smaller things on which they preyed become free to grow and develop. Like the Devonian vertebrates, cryptocurrencies may evolve into new forms but they are here to stay. They will become a familiar and vital part of tomorrow’s global financial system.      Conversely, traditional banks do seem to be on their way out. The financial crisis was the banking equivalent of the asteroid that killed the big dinosaurs. Ever since, they have bumped along the bottom in terms of profitability while failing to develop the services or deliver the returns their customers want.      I cannot see a future in which banks as we know them now still exist. But they, too, might evolve into something different. After all, though the big dinosaurs are long gone, dinosaurs are still with us today. We know them now as birds.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | USDT,Frances Coppola,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/09/08/banks-are-toast-but-crypto-has-lost-its-soul,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/644a7745f67575c4de42e7637e90ef5564344011-1420x950.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432620,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO0Qvh,1599589170,"DeFi's Good, Bad and Ugly","Everyone has fallen in love with decentralized finance (DeFi). We’re all giddy about it. One subset of DeFi is the ever so popular decentralized exchange (DEX). DEXs, such as 0x, Uniswap and Kyber, have tried to compete with centralized exchanges by offering a peer-to-peer trading model, which theoretically requires no intermediaries and no deposits on a centralized exchange.      There’s one big problem: liquidity or, more specifically, a lack of liquidity. In the past, there were buyers that couldn’t find sellers and sellers that couldn’t find buyers. With a lack of liquidity, the spreads on these platforms weren’t competitive to centralized exchanges. This is precisely why centralized exchanges played a critical role bringing market makers and traders to a central limit order book.    Kapil Rathi is CEO of CrossTower, a crypto exchange and structured products provider. He has held senior leadership roles at Cboe, Bats, ISE and the New York Stock Exchange.    The latest breed of DEX have solved this liquidity problem by developing “automated market making” (AMM) models where liquidity providers commit assets into a network (controlled through smart contracts) and the exchange generates bids and offers by using an automated mathematical formula. Partakers at these exchanges are able to generate potentially hefty returns by using techniques like “liquidity mining” and “yield farming.”      See also: Redel/Andoni - DeFi Is Just Like the ICO Boom and Regulators Are Circling      For my non-crypto friends, liquidity mining is analogous to rewarding market makers for providing liquidity with new tokens. Yield farming is an algorithmic way to lend assets into different pools to generate a return. “Farmers” may hop from one protocol to the next to maximize returns. Yield farmers can also be rewarded with incentives, or additional tokens.      One example of a successful decentralized exchange is Uniswap. In fact, according to recent news, Uniswap may be doing more trading volume than the largest U.S. centralized exchange. And many are citing volumes at these decentralized exchanges as the benchmark for success.    not sure I’m ready to commence celebrating high volumes in these food coins.    But before we make that comparison, let’s dig a little deeper into an entity like Uniswap and the “volume” on its platform. A large percentage of Uniswap volume is in coins that are spanking new and may not have a real use case. Anyone can create a token on Uniswap. Does high volume in coins like SUSHI, YAM and KIMCHI really mean Uniswap is better than other exchanges?      We are aware of the allegations that there may be questionable volume on crypto exchanges. Such claims have tarnished the reputation of the crypto industry and may have deterred investors from joining. Have we forgotten the initial coin offering (ICO) craze and how long it took to polish the crypto industry image? Personally, I’m not sure I’m ready to commence celebrating high volumes in these food coins.      It is true the mature coins, such as ETH and USDT, have also seen a lot of volume on Uniswap. Stablecoins are the on and off-ramp of such food coins and these coins are built on the Ethereum network, so naturally they are seeing a spike in volume. That volume does not mean that the DEX is an efficient and effective marketplace.      The returns on some of these food coins have been very lofty. In some cases, one can pocket more than 100% return (or 1,000% in some cases) in a short clip. Sound attractive?      But there is “rug pulling” now, otherwise known as pump and dump. A lot of suspect coins are being introduced solely for the purpose of generating fast returns for token issuers. For example, a new token, HOTDOG, keeping with the food theme, was launched on Uniswap on Sept. 2. It surged to $6,000 in a few hours. Early adopters of that token started selling it, creating a free fall. Within five minutes, HOTDOG went to less than a dollar.      A rug pulling scenario is less likely on a centralized exchange because centralized exchanges have strict listing criteria and trading rules, and work to ensure traders are treated equally.      There may be high volumes on a DEX for other reasons. Could it be possible a group of individuals that have not (or cannot) participate on centralized exchanges are rushing forward to benefit from the decentralized exchange opportunity? Some industry participants highlight the lack of know-your-customer (KYC) obligations on decentralized exchanges. Again, do we really want an industry where lack of KYC is seen as a feature instead of a bug?      There are also issues with “gas guzzling.” Due to these non-tested coins that Uniswap is facilitating, gas prices on ETH are at an all time high. If this choking effect on the network is not stopped soon, it could have a detrimental effect on the value of the network as a whole.      See also: What Is Yield Farming? The Rocket Fuel of DeFi, Explained      We must give credit to Uniswap and other decentralized exchanges for breaking the walls between exchange order matching and market making. Traditional exchanges like CME, CBOE and Nasdaq have tried for years to provide automated market-making tools to their customers. Exchange order types such as pegging orders, discretionary orders, post-only orders and others provide automated pricing and repricing of customers’ interest.      Due to the regulatory roles traditional exchanges play, they are not allowed to provide market-making services for customers on their behalf. Traditional market makers also do not feel confident ceding control to exchanges and empowering them to decide the market makers’ price and size of their quotes. It is a great advancement, or at least a new development, that market makers are comfortable ceding this control to decentralized exchanges.      But market makers may still prefer centralized exchanges over decentralized exchanges because the former are not forced to use the exchange algorithm. Market makers craft their own algorithms, advanced pricing and risk management strategies to determine their quotes, streaming them to a centralized exchange.      Sophisticated market makers may ultimately be reluctant to rely upon a third party to determine their quote quality. A centralized exchange provides market makers a platform on which to compete effectively while a decentralized exchange is a socialized way of treating all market-makers equally without giving any market maker a benefit or edge. Retail customers benefit from a strong marketplace with multiple market makers because this competition provides tight bid and ask spread, i.e. better pricing for the customer.      While we should celebrate innovation and creativity, it is important we as an industry ensure a safe trading environment where there is no front-running, spoofing and other market manipulation practices.      See also: William Mougayar - For DeFi to Grow, CeFi Must Embrace It      People responsible for the design and development of an algorithmic trading system should assume responsibility for an equal and fair market. In the traditional marketplace, the Securities and Exchange Commission introduced the Series 57 license requirement for algorithmic designers and developers.      I share the vision of DeFi to promote interoperability, open source, accessibility and financial inclusion. CeFi can use DeFi principles without jeopardizing the integrity of a safe marketplace. DeFi allows for some incredible benefits to mitigating credit and settlement risk where parties can freely trade without physically moving assets.      There is a lot of potential for innovative products and services. DeFi should be able to innovate within a CeFi framework to facilitate more peer-to-peer transactions among traders that are fully vetted to ensure market participants are protected.

Top shelf    DeFi interest? Retail interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications remains quite low compared to the initial coin offering (ICO) bubble, measured by Google search queries, CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reports. Indexed to the peak of searches for “ICO,” searches on Google Trends for the word “DeFi” currently return a value of 18, indicating the retail crowd is as interested in open-source finance as they were in ICOs during the latter’s boom. Put in context, these searches come amid a period when the total value locked into the DeFi ecosystem has increased 1,300% to above $9 billion this year, approximately 66% higher than the $5.4 billion raised by ICOs in 2017. This disparity between searches and capital may indicate that DeFi’s growth is being driven by savvy investors.      Quadriga update In the latest legal update to the 18-month long QuadrigaCX saga, Canadian law firm Miller Thomson has hired a consultancy firm to perform blockchain analytics as it works to return $200 million in crypto customers are said to have lost, after the exchange’s chief executive died under mysterious circumstances. The firm, Kroll, will pair with its “strategic partner” Coinfirm to analyze a subset of transaction data, CoinDesk’s Nikhilesh De reports, for a $50,000 CAD ($38,000 U.S.) fee. Miller Thomson noted it could not begin the process of disbursing funds until Ernst & Young (EY) finalizes its record of who is owed what and the Canada Revenue Agency has completed its audit of the exchange. So far, about $46 million CAD (around $35 million U.S.) has been recovered.      Fraud accusations Yaroslav Shtadchenko, former project manager at now defunct crypto fund Bitsonar, has formally accused his former employer of six criminal offenses including fraud. Filing a notice of criminal offence with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Shtadchenko said he “became aware that Bitsonar was actually a financial pyramid” last spring, CoinDesk’s Anna Baydakova reports. Bitsonar was an investment firm that managed to raise up to $2.5 million in crypto from investors. The exchange froze withdrawals in February and the website went offline in August.      Lightning round Bitfinex and other early-stage Bitcoin startup investors led a pre-seed funding round for the Lightning Network-based derivatives platform LN Markets. Launched in March 2020, LN Markets has reached nearly $10 million in aggregate traded volume and has over 100 channels connected to its exchange, CoinDesk’s Zack Voell reports. It’s designed to avoid slow and costly on-chain transactions by connecting traders to a bitcoin (BTC) derivatives market by “streaming” their funds through the Lightning Network. Bitfinex’s CTO Paolo Ardoino said, “This is one of our first public investments and underlines our support for the Lightning Network.”      AWS solutions Indian tech giant Tech Mahindra announced it will offer blockchain solutions built to global customers using Amazon Web Services (AWS).

SushiSwap, a fork of Uniswap, aimed to further decentralize the automated money market by sharing revenues through a liquidity provider token (LP), called sushi (SUSHI).      The protocol leveraged a unique strategy of “zombie mining,” meant to draw liquidity and participants from Uniswap, by paying out extra LP tokens for users staking sushi on Uniswap. In just a week and a half, approximately $1.27 billion was raised, CoinDesk’s Will Foxley reports.      On Saturday, Sushi’s pseudonymous founder Chef Nomi sold his share of LP tokens Saturday for 37,400 ether (ETH), worth approximately $13 million, in what David Hoffman of Bankless called a “sin of betrayal.”      “When the anonymous founder market-dumps all his SUSHI upon the rest of the community, it is a sin of the highest order because the person that was supposed to be a leader instead defected and took everyone else for chumps,” Hoffman wrote in a recent newsletter.      “Again I did not intend to do any harm. I’m sorry if my decision did not follow what you expected,” Nomi tweeted.      Control of the project has since been transferred to FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried, who plans to instantiate a multi-signature contract before the project can be fully decentralized into the hands of SushiSwap LP token holders.    Market intel    Buying the dip People are “buying the dip.” Bitcoin’s fall from $12,400 to $10,000 over the past three weeks has led to a 2% increase in the number of ""accumulation addresses,” or addresses that have at least two incoming transfers and have never spent funds, according to data source Glassnode. The divergence between prices and accumulation addresses suggests that investors view the recent price drop as a typical bull market pullback and expect prices to rise once more. ""Markets typically retrace one third or more in a bull market after local euphoria,"" Su Zhu, CEO of Singapore-based Three Arrows Capital said, suggesting prices could drop to as low as $8,800 and still be a ""healthy target.""      Bitcoin options Bitcoin’s options traders are seemingly bullish in the long term but bearish for now. According to data source Skew, the six-month put-call skew, which measures the value of puts, or bearish bets, relative to that of calls, bullish bets, is currently seen at -10%. This negative number indicates that call options expiring six months from now are drawing higher prices or demand than puts. However, the one-month skew has crossed above zero, a sign of investors adding put options to position for a deeper short-term price decline, CoinDesk markets reporter Omkar Godbole reports. Meanwhile, new data shows crypto derivative volumes rose 54% to more than $710 billion in August, surpassing a previous all-time high of $602 billion monthly volumes reported in May.    Tech pod    Gas tokens Ethereum developers are weighing ditching a smart contract feature that offers rebates amid a period of climbing Ethereum gas fees. At stake are gas tokens, a way to essentially “tokenize” gas by allowing Ethereum users to buy up transaction fees when they are low and then spend them when the fee price rises. Developer Alexey Akhunov proposed last June to get rid of these gas tokens, which made up 1.5% to 2% of Ethereum transactions over the summer. While the matter is still under discussion, some developers worry tokenized gas could one day act as a “price floor” for transaction fees and keep them permanently high, CoinDesk’s Will Foxley reports.    Op-ed    Volatility & risk In the latest Crypto Long & Short newsletter, CoinDesk’s Head of Research Noelle Acheson looks at the relationship between volatility and risk, and why the two metrics are erroneously conflated. Often crypto’s volatility is seen as a barrier to entry, as Fidelity Digital Assets found in a recent survey. Yet, high volatility is not the same as risk. “Volatility is a metric, a number, a measurement. Risk is an ambiguous concept,” she writes. “If we equate volatility with risk, then we are implying that we can measure risk. We can’t. Risk is based on the unknown. Bad things can happen from any direction, at any time, at any speed, in an infinite array of forms and configurations.    Podcast corner    Eth 2.0 staking Ethereum 2.0 is coming, eventually.

Called GoodDollar, the project will create and issue a stablecoin ($G) that can be distributed daily to registered users as a form of universal basic income (UBI).  At launch, each $G token will be backed by dai (DAI) stablecoins, although the plan is to diversify collateral so that each stablecoin is backed by a basket of cryptocurrencies.  The UBI model is sustained by supporters who deposit underlying assets onto the platform and then yield farm on supported decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, like Compound or Aave.  Some of the accrued interest is then handed back to supporters, with the rest used as collateral for new $G tokens that are distributed each day.  GoodDollar is a non-profit funded by donations from eToro. An app and wallet have been released alongside the announcement on Tuesday.  Per the announcement, GoodDollar says hundreds of new wallets have been created in countries like South Africa and Nigeria, as well as Venezuela.  An eToro spokesperson told CoinDesk that “over 100,000 G$ have been distributed to over 250 users” during the course of a two-week trial.

42432630,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO0RDh,1599573873,"Ukraine Leads Global Crypto Adoption, Chainalysis Says in New Report","Developing countries are driving retail crypto adoption, and Ukraine is leading the way, according to a new report by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis.      Ukraine, Russia and Venezuela are the top three countries for cryptocurrency adoption, Chainalysis said in its Global Cryptocurrency Adoption Index, published Tuesday as a part of the firm’s upcoming report on global trends in crypto usage.      The U.S. and China are still delivering the largest transaction volumes, but putting aside the largest “whale” crypto holders, Ukrainians, Russians and Venezuelans are the most active retail users of digital currencies, according to Chainalysis’ ranking. They are followed by China, Kenya and the U.S.      Chainalysis measured crypto adoption using on-chain cryptocurrency value received by a country, on-chain value transferred, number of on-chain cryptocurrency deposits and peer-to-peer exchange trade volume. The data was weighted by the purchasing power parity per capita and number of internet users in each country.      The list of “winners” might look surprising, but only at first glance, said Kim Grauer, head of research at Chainalysis. For example, Russia has a history of using e-payment services, Grauer explained. People are used to digital payments, so the transition to cryptocurrencies might be a bit more seamless.      Ukraine, for its part, has “a really tech-native population” she added, and both countries also have “a really industrious startup environment.” There is also more cybercrime activity in Eastern Europe than in other regions, which might add to the busy crypto market.      As CoinDesk previously reported, Ukraine is a hotbed for cryptocurrency adoption, with a tech-savvy population and crypto-curious government that is currently working on future regulations for the industry in cooperation with the local blockchain community.      The patterns for crypto usage varies from country to country. Ukraine and Russia are actively using crypto to send money for business-to-business and cross-border transactions, avoiding cumbersome banking regulations. In Venezuela, people use crypto more for savings and peer-to-peer trading.      “People in Venezuela don’t necessarily want to go to cryptocurrencies because it’s interesting or a cool thing to do, but because they are looking for a stable source of value,” Grauer said. She added that there is also an active remittance market between Venezuela and Argentina.      In Russia, Venezuela and Ukraine, crypto adoption is driven more by retail investors, while in China and the U.S., the crypto whales are the biggest drivers of growth, Grauer said.      “Looking at the share of the transfers greater than $100,000, we noticed that over the past year the share of the overall activity in North America that is professional has been growing,” she said.    Ukraine’s crypto game    Out of the three nations, Ukraine may be the most surprising leader because the country largely flies under the radar of the global crypto community. Located in Eastern Europe and with a population of 42 million, the nation has both an unstable economy and tech-savvy citizens, which apparently is a good recipe for crypto use.      Ukraine’s Ministry of Digital Transformation said there are several reasons for the popularity of crypto among Ukrainians: a big blockchain developer community and tech-savvy population in general, cumbersome regulations for export and import transactions and the absence of the stock market in the country. All of this is encouraging people to try out digital assets, the Ministry said in a blog post.      Read more: Why Ukraine Is Ripe for Cryptocurrency Adoption      Michael Chobanyan, founder of Ukraine’s first crypto exchange, Kuna, said small businesses, which are using crypto to circumnavigate foreign currency regulations, might be turning around up to $5 million worth of crypto every week, according to a loose estimate. They mostly pay for imports coming from Turkey and are using tether (USDT) in 90% of transactions, he added.    Retail drive    There are many retail crypto investors in Ukraine, too, Chobanyan believes. Kuna sees about $800,000 worth of retail crypto trades daily, he said. And this is just a fraction of overall retail volume, given the popularity of exchanges like Binance and EXMO, as well as numerous cash over the counter dealers in the country.      Retail investors are interested in crypto as there are not many other options for savings and passive income in Ukraine. The economy is small and there is no national stock market. Banks often fail and investing in real estate is too expensive for most people, Chobanyan said.      Crypto, on the other hand, has a low barrier to entry, easier compliance requirements and is safer than just holding onto cash.      Alex Bornyakov, the deputy minister for digital transformation of Ukraine, believes that individuals, not businesses, are the most active crypto users in the country.      “They are using cryptocurrencies for small investments and trading,” he explained.      This is an educated guess so far, he admits, as there is no official statistics for cryptocurrency usage in the country.      Read more: Chainalysis Report Shows Healthy Crypto Usage in Venezuela      Crypto, like U.S. dollars, is a hedge against the volatility of the national currency, Ukrainian hryvnia, and against the general instability of Ukraine’s political and economic situation, said Ukrainian Bitcoin Core developer Hennadii Stepanov, going by hebasto.      “Our situation is similar to that in Iran and Venezuela,” he said, adding: “Unlike gold, bitcoin is available for everyone.”      Adoption is limited, however, said Gleb Naumenko, another Bitcoin Core dev with Ukrainian origins.      “Many of my friends know somebody who invested [in crypto]. I see huge interest, but the technology is still lagging behind. It’s hard to use it, and that scares people away,” Naumenko said.    Pandemic activation    According to Binance’s head for Russia and Ukraine, Gleb Kostarev, although Ukraine is not the biggest volume driver for Binance, it’s nonetheless one of the key markets for the exchange. The firm is constantly working on new fiat on-ramps for the Ukrainian hryvnia and is actively cooperating with the Ukrainian government on future crypto regulation, Kostarev added.      For both Ukraine and Russia, the COVID-19 pandemic became a driver for adoption, as the pandemic hit both economies hard, Kostarev said. Isolated at home, people turned to crypto as a new source of income.      “The macroeconomic situation in Ukraine remains complicated, and during the coronavirus pandemic it got even worse. The government is working on new ways to stimulate the economy, while the young population has to search for new sources of income. This is one of the key reasons for Ukraine’s interest for crypto,” Kostarev said.      Read more: Binance Credited With Helping Take Down Ukraine Crypto Laundering Group      Kyrylo Chykhradze, product director for the analysis platform Crystal Blockchain, said Ukraine's registered crypto businesses have processed only $300 million in bitcoin since 2015, a fraction of the $150 billion that passed through U.S. bitcoin markets over the same period.      However, the low numbers can be partly explained by the fact that Ukraine-based and Ukraine-oriented crypto enterprises often chose other jurisdictions to register, so officially they are not in Ukraine.      “There is still a lack of legal grounding as of yet on the digital asset front, which has resulted in local crypto businesses targeting other locations (such as the U.K. or Estonia) to operate from,” Chykhradze said. He added that the efforts to put crypto businesses into the legal field by the government can change the situation in the future.    Tricky data    Quantifying crypto activity by country gets tricky, as individual bitcoin wallets aren’t marked with geographical locations. Chainalysis admits that geographic data is hard to get right if you only look at on-chain transactions, so the firm requested data directly from the global P2P trading platforms, namely LocalBitcoins and Paxful, and talked to experts on the ground, Grauer said.      To see activity in particular countries, Chainalysis mostly looked at web traffic on the crypto trading, merchant, gambling and other services using SimilarWeb, Grauer explained. If that data was not available, transaction data was analyzed using time zones, most popular fiat currency pairs, language options used and the location of the headquarters of the services.      Read more: Whistleblower Kidnapped in Ukraine After Accusing Crypto Firm of Exit Scam      Chainalysis also weights the numbers against each country’s purchasing power parity so that the poorer countries with more volatile currencies still can rank high if they are active in retail crypto trades (transactions worth less than $10,000). This means the highest-ranking countries are not necessarily the ones with the largest crypto volumes. Rather, they are the countries where people put a larger share of their assets into cryptocurrency.      “Countries have different populations and different GDP, so if you’re just doing index without weights it’s all skewed towards China and the U.S.” Grauer said.      A country’s position in the ranking is not defined by any single factor, Grauer said.      “Ukraine and Russia are not number one in any of the submetrics but they are in the top 10 by the [crypto] value received and the number of crypto deposits, and they perform well across the board,” she said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,"Anna Baydakova, Danny Nelson",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/09/08/ukraine-leads-global-crypto-adoption-chainalysis-says-in-new-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/89a4b3d4a3e204339249a87139a87aedd2d97aa6-1200x766.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It would further reduce the counterparty risk associated by holding funds on multiple exchanges to service derivatives contracts.  Fireblocks said the new partnership would enable the trading of digital asset derivatives using any form of collateral.  According to the announcement, JST Capital, global crypto firm XBTO and digital asset investment company LedgerPrime became the first customers to successfully trade using X-Margin’s distributed clearing network.  Fireblocks recently joined forces with blockchain analytics firm Elliptic to automate anti-money laundering compliance for their shared institutional clients.

42432632,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO0RHh,1599568051,First Mover: SushiSwap's Billion-Dollar 'Rug Pull' Is Thriller to Crypto Geeks,"You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team and edited by Bradley Keoun, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to.    Price Point    Bitcoin was down early Tuesday, barely holding above the important psychological threshold of $10,000.      Prices for the cryptocurrency, up 40% year to date, have held above $10,000 for more than six weeks. The digital-asset firm Diginex wrote in a newsletter post that ""prices will need to regain $10,550 to settle the nerves of traders.""      On Wall Street, U.S. stock futures were lower, pulled by tech shares as traders returned from a long holiday weekend. The dollar strengthened in foreign-exchange markets and Treasury bond yields fell, indicating a reduced risk appetite, though gold was off. The British pound slipped on speculation that a ""no-deal"" Brexit looms.    Market Moves    In a 2020 during which the fast-growing arena of decentralized finance, or DeFi, has produced a seemingly unending series of jaw-dropping, billion-dollar twists, the past few days' saga of the market-making protocol SushiSwap is drawing comparisons to a thrilling caper flick.      The Bankless newsletter called it ""the SushiSwap rug pull."" It was ""one of ""the most dramatic moments in DeFi this year,"" according to The Defiant newsletter. Jay Hao, CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange OKEx, called it ""one of those action-packed high-drama movies the likes of which crypto hasn't witnessed in recent times.""      Of course, all this is from the perspective of crypto geekdom, and it's really just the latest tech-gone-wild iteration of the reliable human themes of invention, fear, greed, mania and panic.      As reported Monday by CoinDesk's Will Foxley, a pseudonymous developer who goes by ""Chef Nomi"" launched the SushiSwap protocol in late August, and it was quickly cast as a ""vampire protocol"" because its inherent design intended to siphon away liquidity from a competing trading platform, Uniswap.      The project quickly attracted more than $1 billion of collateral with a technique known as ""zombie mining,"" The market value of the associated SUSHI tokens surged roughly 500-fold in a matter of days to more than $300 million.      And then on Saturday, SUSHI investors learned that Chef Nomi had unexpectedly cashed out of tokens in exchange for 37,400 ether (ETH) worth about $13 million. SUSHI prices crashed before recovering somewhat after Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, reportedly took control of the project.      Bankman-Fried tweeted early Monday that ""the great Sushi experiment"" of migrating markets over from Uniswap will take place ""one at a time, starting in 48 hours,"" potentially setting up something of a sequel.      ""If you're in it for the wild gains, if you're chasing clearly unsustainable percentage leaps, you have to be able to stomach the losses as well,"" Hao wrote.      Read More: Fishy Business: What Happened to $1.2B DeFi Protocol SushiSwap Over the Weekend      The episode is one of several prompting comparisons of DeFi to the 2017-18 initial coin offering (ICO) bubble, when little-known and barely-tested developers took advantage of surging prices for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to raise the equivalent of at least $12 billion.      According to the website DeFi Market Cap, decentralized-finance applications, mainly focused on lending and trading businesses, now have a combined market value of about $14 billion.      One key difference so far is DeFi does not appear to have penetrated the consciousness of individual investors, as happened during ICO boom. Amateur traders also have flocked recently in the stock market, embodied in the success of platforms like Robinhood.      CoinDesk's Omkar Godbole reported Tuesday that Google searches on the keyword ""DeFi"" register nowhere near the scale of ""ICO"" searches a couple years ago.      “DeFi is an incrementally accretive and sustainable trend while ICOs were not,"" according to Su Zhu, CEO of the Singapore-based fund management firm Three Arrows Capital.      The SUSHI saga? Sustainable? Just don't tell the Robinhood crowd about it.      Read More: DeFi Is Hot but Retail Interest Nowhere Close to ICO Frenzy    Bitcoin Watch    Bitcoin's recent drop from $12,400 to $10,000 has revived interest in short-term put options or bearish bets.    The one-month put-call skew has crossed above zero, a sign of put options drawing higher demand than call options.  In other words, investors are adding bets to position for a deeper price pullback, which could be seen if risk aversion grips traditional markets.  ""Investors should be cognizant of movements in the stock market as a supplement to on-chain fundamentals in determining the expected behavior of BTC and crypto markets in general,"" according to the blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode.  The six-month skew continues to hover below zero. It shows investors remain confident about the cryptocurrency's long-term price prospects.

42384631,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAko4H,1599566128,European Crypto Tax Companies Announce Merger to Power US Expansion,"Two of Europe's largest crypto tax reporting firms are to merge in an effort to turbocharge a planned expansion into the U.S. market.    Austria-based Blockpit and Germany's Crypto Tax announced the merger Tuesday, saying they would start offering a range of compliance and tax services, all under one roof.  Crypto Tax provides tax reporting frameworks, for crypto and non-crypto assets such as traditional securities, that can be adjusted to different countries; Blockpit offers tax reporting and know-your-transaction (KYT) compliance tools.  Klaus Himmer, co-founder and managing director of CryptoTax, and Florian Wimmer, founder, and CEO of Blockpit, told CoinDesk the merger will make them a full-scale regtech company.  The new company will trade under the ""Blockpit"" brand, but will retain the ""Crypto Tax"" name for the taxation services.  Structured by Austrian M&A specialist Venionaire, Wimmer said the merger was close to a 50:50 deal.  Blockpit's existing offices in Linz will become the new headquarters for the newly merged company, with Crypto Tax's offices in Munich to be retained.  A tax solution had already been developed by Crypto Tax but has yet to be rolled out.  The new company, already prevalent in the German-speaking world, will now turn its attention to rolling out specialized regtech products in the much-larger U.S. market.  The new Blockpit plans to raise €1.6 million (~$1.9 million) from both companies' existing investors and get the ball rolling on an extended Series C to fund the U.S. move.  A prospective expansion to other English-speaking countries, as well as the Asian markets, is in the works for 2021.  Wimmer said the merger has likely saved both companies a year or so building out products the other company already had.

According to data source Skew, the six-month put-call skew, which measures the value of puts, or bearish bets, relative to that of calls, bullish bets, is currently seen at -10%.  The negative number indicates the call options expiring six months from now are drawing higher prices or demand than puts.  The six-month skew shows bitcoin's pullback from $12,400 to $10,000 seen in the past three weeks has failed to weaken investor confidence in the cryptocurrency's long-term prospects.  However, the one-month skew has crossed above zero, a sign of investors adding put options to position for a deeper short-term price decline.  Bitcoin has developed a sensitivity to traditional markets over the past six months.  Hence, a notable drop in the global equity markets could yield a stronger pullback in bitcoin, as noted by blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode.  Major European stocks are nursing losses on Tuesday, with U.S. equity index futures pointing to a risk aversion on Wall Street. Futures tied to the Nasdaq index are down over 200 points at press time.  Bitcoin is currently trading near $10,030, having faced rejection above $10,400 during the Asian trading hours.

42384637,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAko9J,1599557676,DeFi Is Hot but Retail Interest Nowhere Close to ICO Frenzy,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) has exploded in 2020, but retail interest in the space remains quite low, if measured by Google search queries.      These suggest it may still be too early to draw parallels between DeFi's growth and the initial coin offering (ICO) bubble of the final months of 2017 and early 2018.      Indexed to the peak of searches for “ICO,” searches on Google Trends for the word ""DeFi"" currently return a value of 18, indicating the retail crowd is as interested in open-source finance as they were in ICOs during the latter’s boom.      The DeFi movement seeks to transform old financial products into trustless and transparent protocols by leveraging decentralized networks.      See also: For DeFi to Grow, CeFi Must Embrace It      Google Trends provides access to a mostly unfiltered sample of actual search requests made to Google. It displays an interest in a particular topic from around the globe and scales searches 0 to 100, though it does not give out raw totals.      Some investors have started comparing the DeFi explosion to the ICO bubble, which left millions of investors holding worthless alternative cryptocurrencies. An initial coin offering is the crypto market's equivalent of an initial public offering for stocks.      Why the comparison? The total value locked into the decentralized finance applications has increased by a staggering 1,300% to above $9 billion this year, according to data source defipulse.com. That number is 66% higher than the $5.4 billion raised by initial coin offerings in 2017 and nearly double the $4.6 billion raised by ICOs in the first quarter of 2018, just before the cold days of “crypto winter"".      The trading volumes at major decentralized exchanges are now challenging centralized exchanges. For instance, Uniswap, a decentralized exchange facilitating peer-to-peer trading without a central authority, overtook the largest U.S.-based centralized exchange, Coinbase Pro, in terms of 24-hour trading volumes earlier this week.      See also: DeFi Degens Are Crypto’s Suicide Squad      Some of the DeFi-associated tokens like Aave's LEND have rallied by over 3,000% this year, leaving bitcoin far behind. The top cryptocurrency by market value is currently up 43% on a year-to-date basis.      One interpretation for why DeFi isn’t receiving the same retail attention as ICO is its growth is being fueled by fewer but more sophisticated investors than those involved with ICOs.      In other words, Defi is not even close to the ICO hype bubble level yet, as noted by cryptocurrency derivatives trader Cantering Clark. Bubbles are usually the result of a euphoric retail crowd running ahead of itself.      “DeFi is an incrementally accretive and sustainable trend while ICOs were not,"" according to Su Zhu, co-founder, and CEO of the Singapore-based fund management firm Three Arrows Capital.      Experience with what DeFi actually does may also be a factor. Denis Vinokourov, head of research at London-based prime brokerage Bequant, says firms that trade on centralized exchanges aren't taking decentralized exchanges seriously. However, firms trading on both have realized that the long-term growth potential of decentralized exchanges.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/09/08/defi-is-hot-but-retail-interest-nowhere-close-to-ico-frenzy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/96844d4abfa52a3773485a5178139a16741a262c-1920x1161.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

When asked, the LN Markets team declined to disclose the amount raised.  The exchange offers up to 50x leverage, according to a presentation shared with CoinDesk, and users can trade directly from any Lightning Network wallet.  Bitfinex’s CTO Paolo Ardoino said, “This is one of our first public investments and underlines our support for the Lightning Network.”  Because the Lightning Network is a technology that Bitfinex “loves,” it is “important for us to provide funding and to participate in such an innovative venture,” he added.  Directly linking users’ wallets to the derivatives exchange “sets an example of how exchanges should let users operate with their funds,” said Tobias Hoffmann, bitcoin developer and trader on LN Markets.

42384620,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAknrh,1599552064,QuadrigaCX Users' Law Firm Launches Blockchain Analytics Investigation,"Canadian law firm Miller Thomson has hired consultancy firm Kroll to perform blockchain analytics work in relation to the ongoing dissolution of QuadrigaCX, the exchange which failed last year after its CEO Gerald Cotten was reported to have died.      The firm, which represents the now-former users of Quadriga pursuant to a court order, announced the move in a notice to creditors Friday, adding that Kroll would work “with its strategic partner Coinfirm” to analyze a subset of transaction data. Miller Thomson began looking for an analytics firm at the beginning of the year.      “Since being founded in early 2016, Coinfirm has created a powerful analytics engine for blockchain tracing exercises,” the update said. “The Kroll/Coinfirm partnership will use a combination of professionals as needed with experience in cryptocurrency, asset tracing/searching, asset recovery, fraud investigations, and data analytics.”      The law firm will not share further details “due to confidentiality,” the document said, though it said Miller Thomson arrived at the decision in conjunction with the Official Committee, a group of users appointed by a Canadian court to act as a sort of liaison between the law firm and the broader group of former customers.      Miller Thomson was likewise appointed to represent Quadriga's former customers last year, alongside Ernst and Young (EY), which is acting as a bankruptcy trustee and has been tasked with identifying and securing any of Quadriga's funds to disburse back to its former customers. So far, about $46 million CAD (around $35 million U.S.) has been recovered, according to the Ontario Securities Commission, far short of the nearly $200 million customers are supposedly owed.      Kroll will receive a fee of $50,000 and is indemnified against any potential lawsuit up to $150,000.    Crypto Capital    Miller Thomson did not provide any other information about what users could expect in terms of fund distributions. The law firm did update Quadriga’s users about its research into Crypto Capital however, announcing it had “forwarded the information” it received from individuals to EY and found that Crypto Capital does not currently possess any of Quadriga’s holdings.      “Representative Counsel understands that based on the Trustee’s review of the information provided by Affected Users and information in its possession, there is currently insufficient evidence to establish that Crypto Capital owed any funds to Quadriga as of the date of bankruptcy,” the update said.      The update caps a brief investigation which began in January of this year, when Miller Thomson asked Quadriga’s users to share any information they had about the Panama-registered “shadow bank,” whose operators currently face a host of charges in the U.S. (one, Reginald Fowler, was arrested and is now awaiting trial).      Read more: 17,000 People Have Filed Claims for Refunds From QuadrigaCX, Auditor EY Says      At the time, Miller Thomson said it was looking into whether the payment processor held any of Quadriga's funds due to the fact that Quadriga apparently maintained no corporate or accounting records, and therefore EY could not determine which companies held its funds.      While Quadriga's customers may be hoping for a prompt payout of funds, it does not appear the legal process, which has stretched out 18 months so far, will end anytime soon. Miller Thomson noted it could not begin the process of disbursing funds until EY has finalized its record of who is owed what and the Canada Revenue Agency has completed its audit of the exchange.      ""The most material impact on the speed of distribution will be the CRA’s audit of Quadriga’s tax liabilities,"" Friday's update said.
