For example, you have to trust that your belongings are safe when staying at a hotel. Or that they do not tamper with your food and drinks. Or that you&apos;ll get what you pay for. Blockchain technology can help revolutionize the industry by ensuring all payments are handled securely and honestly. Furthermore, they can offer immutable records and prevent tampering with customer reviews or star ratings on hotels, restaurants, and tours. Ways Blockchain Can Help The Hospitality Industry Using blockchain technology for hotel operations will provide hotels with real-time information about their guests, thus improving the efficiency of their operations. For example, a blockchain-enabled check-in process will reduce the time it takes for guests to check in, increasing the level of customer satisfaction. Hotels can also track their guests&apos; movements, which will help them improve services and increase guest satisfaction. To use blockchain technology for hotel operations, hotel owners can obtain blockchain education and create a platform where guests can share their data. 1. Improved Customer Experience Imagine a customer checking into a hotel. With blockchain, they can book their stay without ever interacting with an employee.

42374849,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw30mD,1651012008,First Mover Asia: Spot Bitcoin ETFs Are Launching in Australia but Elsewhere They Face Brutal Fund Outflows,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin, ether and other major cryptos plummeted as investors remained averse to risk.  Insights: Spot BTC ETFs launch in Australia. But elsewhere, they are facing fund outflows.  Technician's take: BTC's current pullback is similar to what occurred in September of last year, albeit with weak price momentum.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $38,418 -4.5%  Ether (ETH): $2,839 -5.7%  Top Gainers  There are no gainers in CoinDesk 20 today.  Top Losers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Dogecoin DOGE −8.9% Currency Ethereum Classic ETC −8.1% Smart Contract Platform EOS EOS −6.4% Smart Contract Platform  Bitcoin and other major cryptos plunge  After a promising start to the week, bitcoin swooned on Tuesday, recently dropping about 4.5% over the past 24 hours as investors continued their recent risk-off posture amid the same macroeconomic uncertainty that has been plaguing the world throughout the year.  Just a day after bitcoin soared past $40,500 on news of financial giant Fidelity's decision to allow consumers to invest in bitcoin in their 401(k) retirement savings accounts, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading just over $38,000, its lowest mark since early March. Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was changing hands at about $2,820, off roughly 5.7%, following a day when it pushed past $3,000.  Other major altcoins by market cap were in the red, many of them significantly so. Terra's LUNA token and ADA were both recently down over 7%. Popular meme coin DOGE fell more than 9%.  Analysts have been cautious in predicting cryptos' trend in the coming weeks as bitcoin has wrestled with the $40,000 threshold with one analyst writing in a report that secondary support could form ""near $27,200.""  Crypto declines tracked equity markets, which tumbled as Wall Street digested an inauspicious beginning to the earnings season, fiscal tightening by the U.S. central bank, discouraging economic data and signs that Russia would escalate its attacks on neighboring Ukraine. The tech-focused Nasdaq declined a whopping 3.9%, while the S&P 500 fell 2.8%.  On Tuesday, Google parent Alphabet (GOOG) said its first-quarter profit had dropped 8%, and in a report, Deutsche Bank (DB) predicted ""a major recession,"" revising its forecast of earlier this month for a milder downturn. The latest economic news came as Russia cut off natural gas supplies to Poland, which has been fearful that it could be a target of Russian aggression. Separately, Russia accused Western countries supportive of Ukraine of conducting a proxy war.  ""Bitcoin reversed lower as risk aversion returned to Wall Street, with tech stocks leading the decline,"" Oanda Americas Senior Market Analyst Edward Moya wrote in an email, noting Russia's decision on Poland gas exports. Moya added: ""Ethereum also turned negative and will continue to follow what happens on Wall Street.""  Markets  S&P 500: 4,175 -2.8%  DJIA: 33,240 -2.3%  Nasdaq: 12,490 -3.9%  Gold: $1,905 +0.3%  Insights  Spot BTC ETFs launch in Australia. But elsewhere, they are facing fund outflows.  Australia is going to have its own bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the near future, despite some delays because of problems with the plumbing that delayed Wednesday’s (April 27) scheduled launch.  Australia follows a long list of bitcoin ETF issuances in Canada and Europe. There’s still no spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S., but traders in Toronto, Europe and South America are able to trade frequently and in sizable volumes if they choose.  But as the Australian ETF prepares to launch it faces a market with compressed premiums and fast outflows. One of Australia’s ""priciest funds"" is listing just over a year after the first bitcoin ETFs hit the market in Toronto.  In the eyes of traders, these ETFs replaced the Grayscale Bitcoin Fund (GBTC) as a way to hold crypto in registered or institutional accounts. The premium on GBTC flipped negative and has stayed deeply in that territory ever since – now at -23%. (Grayscale is a CoinDesk sister company.)  The U.S. still doesn’t have a spot bitcoin ETF. But other nations quickly listed their own, and the vehicle became popular at exchanges in Europe and South America. As U.S.-based investors are familiar with the Canadian market they flocked northward, including ARK Investment.  While ETF issuers were once secretly cheerful of GBTC’s fate that cheer might have been glib as on the eve of the listing of the first Australian bitcoin ETF data shows major outflows from crypto ETFs and premium compressions.  As bitcoin continues its rangebound trajectory, drifting between $37,000 and$45,000, ETF traders seem to have lost interest and are choosing to exit the 3iQ Coinshares bitcoin ETF via redemptions after buying the dip in March. Of course, there have been other periods of outflows but they haven’t been this prominent.  And with this outflow comes a compression in premiums to the point where it's now a discount.     The 3iQ Coinshares bitcoin ETF is now trading at a -2.7% discount. This isn’t GBTC-level bad because the ETF is known to gyrate between premiums and discounts. During the 2021 summer rebound after the spring crash (where it hit a low of 5%), for instance, the ETF traded at a premium of 5.7%, occasionally rebounding to highs of 2.5%-2.7% throughout the year as the price oscillated upwards.  What will happen to Australia’s bitcoin ETF from Cosmos? Given that it's launching in a market with a net outflow from bitcoin ETFs as well as exchanges as traders look to HODL, it’s unlikely that the premium will last.  But historically speaking, strong flows are also a bullish sign as investors look to hold on to their crypto after the end of a correction anticipating prices to increase. Traders will eventually return along with their liquidity and the premium will return, but it will be a tough few months before it happens as all bitcoin ETFs look to regain their footing.  Talk about launching in a tough market.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Pullback Deepens, Support at $37K  Bitcoin (BTC) extended its decline on Tuesday, although support at $37,500 could stabilize the down move.  The cryptocurrency is attempting to maintain a series of higher price lows since Jan. 24, which typically coincides with rising price momentum. This time, however, a bearish setup on the monthly chart could increase the risk of a breakdown in price.  Buyers will need to keep BTC elevated above $40,000, the midpoint of a three-month price range, in order to sustain the current recovery phase.  BTC's current pullback is similar to what occurred in September of last year, when buyers began to take profits around the $46,000-$50,000 resistance zone. Still, unlike the current situation, last year's rally above $40,000 benefited from positive long-term momentum.  For now, BTC's wide trading range could continue for another week until a decisive breakout or breakdown is confirmed.

The seed funding round included investments from Galaxy Interactive, BITKRAFT and Arca, among others, Ola GG said in a statement.  The firm said it serves as a “regionally focused subDAO” and an “extension of the main YGG DAO.” However, Ola GG operates independently from a legal standpoint, a company representative told CoinDesk.  The funds will be used to acquire yield-generating non-fungible tokens (NFT) and the creation of Spanish-language educational content, Ola GG said. Proceeds will also be used to expand the adoption of play-to-earn gaming in the U.S., Latin America and Spain.  “The Hispanic market has many similarities to that of Southeast Asia, which is where YGG was born. With so many people living below the poverty line and lacking access to quality education, we are seeing an equally strong appetite for play-to-earn blockchain games and, with it, the adoption of cryptocurrencies,” Ola GG co-founder Clara Bullrich said in a statement.  Bullrich, a partner at the international multi-family office Alvarium Investments, co-founded Ola GG with Nicolás del Pino, who also co-founded Liquid Meta, a public liquidity mining operation. Del Pino also served in the past as a commercial partner at Bitex.la, a Latin American crypto exchange.  Currently, Ola GG has 3,000 scholarship players in its shared reward program, in which the guild keeps 30% of the earnings and does not require upfront compensation. Ola GG allows its members to play Axie Infinity and CyBall, although it plans to eventually support Genopets, Karmaverse and StarSharks, among other NFT games.  In Latin American countries such as Venezuela, many young people are making a living for their families by playing Axie Infinity, as CoinDesk recently reported.

42374846,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw30hB,1651009267,Crypto Market's Direction During a Recession Might Depend on Nasdaq,"With inflation reaching new highs month after month, and the Federal Reserve taking an increasingly hawkish stance, the U.S. economy is exposed to an elevated risk of upcoming recession.  The COVID-19 recession that began in February 2020 and lasted through April of that year – the most recent in the U.S. – did, however, have a positive impact on cryptocurrencies. It shot bitcoin (BTC) to an all-time high above $28,000 and, more importantly, caused investors and Wall Street firms to start taking the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization seriously.  But if analysts are right, and the U.S. economy is bound to go into another recession as early as next year, the cryptocurrency market could see a very different outcome this time.  Because of bitcoin’s recent strong correlation to U.S. stocks – from the Nasdaq Composite Index to the Standard & Poor's 500 to the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 – the largest cryptocurrency's performance will likely depend on what the broader markets do, according to some analysts.  “Bitcoin has really bound itself to the Nasdaq in terms of correlation, and if the Fed keeps hiking rates and if the market believes [it is] going to hike rates, recession or not, Nasdaq suffers in the short term,” said Bob Iaccino, chief strategist at Path Trading Partners and co-portfolio manager at Stock Think Tank. ""And if this correlation continues, then crypto suffers, too.""  The 90-day correlation between bitcoin and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index has remained elevated since 2020, recently reaching a new high as shown in the chart below.  “During an extended recession I think we will see positive price movement with BTC but the rest of the crypto market would face headwinds as investors continue to move risk off and investors find it harder to raise funds in a tighter lending market,” said Howard Greenberg, a cryptocurrency educator at Prosper Trading Academy.  That strong positive correlation – not just true for bitcoin but some other large crypto assets, like ether (ETH), too – means cryptocurrency returns could suffer from a recession.  “Over the past few years they have become even more correlated to equity markets, and more recently the bond market,” said Joe Haggenmiller, head of markets at XBTO, a crypto finance firm.  “This trend may continue should we go into a recession,"" he said. ""We expect the major cryptocurrencies to follow the broader market on a short-to-medium term basis, on the upside and downside.”  This would be a very different scenario from what crypto markets saw during the COVID-19 recession. While bitcoin hit an all-time-hime and rose over 50% in 2020, equity markets suffered severe losses during the period between January and March 2020 before bouncing back to normal levels as the Fed stimulated traditional markets with freshly printed money.  A recession that drives down stocks might push the Fed to reverse its hawkish stance and move back to a more accommodative stance. And that could end up being a good thing for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies , according to Iaccino.  Are stocks an inflation hedge?  One reason why the correlation between crypto and the equity market is strengthening might be that traders are starting to see stocks as a hedge against inflation, just like bitcoin.  “In inflationary environments, stocks have a distinct advantage over bonds – they’re linked to companies that can adjust pricing – whereas bonds, not so much,” Lawrence Creatura, a fund manager at PRSPCTV Capital LLC, told Bloomberg.  Digital assets might see a drop in prices in the short-term, Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca, wrote in a March 28 report. But digital assets create value through network growth and brand loyalty as opposed to equity and debt, which represent a claim on assets.  ""Given this backdrop, it’s possible digital assets are the only asset class that a recession wouldn’t negatively impact,"" Dorman wrote.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/04/26/crypto-markets-direction-during-a-recession-might-depend-on-nasdaq,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5f407f2c53761305fa4380b710a2dba8738e739e-6048x4024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Furthermore, it wasn&apos;t the first mass shooting and certainly won&apos;t be the last. The deadliest school shootings since Sandy Hook have all taken place within the United States. However, that doesn&apos;t mean there aren&apos;t similar attacks occurring elsewhere in the world. Thankfully, blockchain technology may provide a solution to this problem. That&apos;s if we can find the political will to use it and put the necessary restrictions on its use to keep citizens safe while allowing law enforcement to perform their duties. Why We Need Blockchain-Based Gun Registry? Existing solutions require manual reporting of guns. However, blockchain technology allows owners to register their guns automatically. The technology creates a secure and digital ledger of ownership for each gun with two key benefits. First, using smart contracts, gun sellers would automatically know if they are selling to someone authorized to own a gun (and thus can purchase one). Second, law enforcement can check its blockchain history every time someone uses a gun in a crime or in an accident. This can provide them with a real-time view of its owner&apos;s behavior. It can also reduce confusion over whether it was used in any crimes. It is possible to build a similar system for those seeking firearms training and those who want certification as safe or responsible owners.

Tenev wrote that throughout 2020 and the first half of 2021, the company went through a period of “hyper growth” fueled by coronavirus pandemic lockdowns, low interest rates and government fiscal stimulus. Over that time period, staffing rose by almost six times from 700 to almost 3,800.  That rapid growth led to duplicate roles and functions, Tenev wrote, leading to the decision to cut jobs. “After carefully considering all these factors, we determined that making these reductions to Robinhood’s staff is the right decision to improve efficiency, increase our velocity, and ensure that we are responsive to the changing needs of our customers.”  He noted that Robinhood will continue to introduce key products across its brokerage, crypto and spending saving divisions.

Some indicators suggest a breakdown could occur, while others point to a short-term price bounce.  Currently, the options market places a 60% probability that BTC will trade above $36,000 in May.  In the bitcoin futures market, the average daily basis, or the difference between the spot price and futures price, reached a one-year low. Typically, a rising basis indicates bullish sentiment among futures traders.  ""The basis has only reached similar lows on two prior occasions in the last year: in July, prior to the summer short squeeze, and in February.

Also, there are signs that futures traders are becoming more active. The open interest in BTC perpetuals is currently near a one-year high, after climbing steadily since early March, with more intensive growth in recent days,"" Arcane wrote.  Sentiment has been slightly bearish in the futures market, which could increase the chance of a short squeeze if BTC's price jumps unexpectedly.  On the flip side, technical indicators remain neutral, although some analysts are on watch for a possible breakdown in price.

42407291,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gVxSsw,1651003616,The Future of Crypto Payments Will Be Centralized,"Initially conceived as peer-to-peer (P2P) electronic cash, cryptocurrencies have ideal features for retail payments. These permissionless networks enable independent verification of assets and unparalleled settlement assurance.  Since validating transactions is the primary cost in generating $1.9 trillion of revenue within the global payments market, blockchains will inevitably become mainstream technologies. But how this incredible utility manifests in the real world (e.g., buying clothes and groceries) will likely echo the adoption of the internet itself, and this means many centralized components.  The crypto decentralization meme  There are varying degrees of centralization in all cryptocurrency protocols themselves. In general, tribal arguments center around various interpretations of the Nakamoto coefficient, token distributions and external centralized dependencies. For instance, hardware/software requirements often severely limit average users from participating in network consensus, resulting in centralized mining.  Tyler Spalding is a co-founder at Flexa, a blockchain payments company based in New York City. This piece is part of CoinDesk's Payments Week.  From an ownership perspective, many projects have tokens concentrated with insiders and private buyers. Even Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of the Bitcoin protocol, still controls up to one million bitcoins, methodically mined for 12 months to a myriad of addresses. Custodial services have been a critical driver of mainstream adoption, with Coinbase alone now holding customer assets worth 11% of the entire crypto market.  Considering crypto assets owned by hedge funds, venture capital, corporates, governments and traders, it’s not surprising that more than half of all bitcoin is estimated to be maintained by virtual asset service providers (VASPs). Even custodial services hold at least 61% of staked ether for the upcoming Eth 2 merge.  Potential protocol centralization aside, it’s generally impossible to interact with blockchain assets without centralized services. Critics often lament the Ethereum ecosystem’s dependance on Infura, but that only scratches the surface when considering your web browser, operating system, hardware wallet and even your internet service provider are all typically trusted participants in a cryptocurrency transaction. Users typically trust website and Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates (BGP spoofing was recently used to steal crypto) for Web 3 interactions, and rarely inspect open-source wallet downloads.  “Not your keys, not your coins.” But did you thoroughly audit and appreciate the entirety of the centralized software stack that created the keys for you? At least we can all appreciate the complexity of each of these services coming together without a central authority, just like making pencils.  Centralized finance Lego bricks  Marc Andreessen famously stated the “original sin of the internet” was in missing the opportunity to support native web payments. Despite Netscape’s intent to build integrated payments, the initiative failed due to banks’ lack of support/interest; they believed it wasn’t worth the investment. Almost 30 years later, enabling mainstream crypto payments at scale requires various (centralized) integration points.  At a minimum, networks or payment service providers offering merchants crypto acceptance will need to execute service level agreements and obtain relevant money transmitter licenses for each jurisdiction in which they operate. Even reasonably decentralized routing methods like the Lightning Network will necessarily require licensure for nodes; it is trivial for legislation to prohibit accepting these types of payments otherwise.  Additionally, crypto payments will need to be compatible with $10 billion of installed point-of-sale hardware, online platforms (Shopify, Magento, etc.) and even mobile app ecosystems (iOS and Android). The crypto revolution will be constructed with many, many centralized-finance bricks.  Custodial wallets and crypto payments  Beyond the idealism and technology, people inevitably use products that make their lives easier. People are predominantly going to use custodial wallets for retail payments. These products are safer, cheaper and more straightforward for an average person. People don’t care how payments work; they just want them to work. And they certainly are not comfortable with the possibility of permanently losing assets by forgetting a password or misplacing a seed phrase.  This is why universal, widespread self-hosted wallet usage is extremely unlikely. When it comes to taking considerable time to learn, appreciate and practice meaningful operational security, the larger population is the human incarnation of Gudetama. Keep in mind that the most commonly used internet password is still 123456.  The elegance of crypto is that despite requiring layers of centralized interfaces and integrations for real-world use, it still offers a genuine freedom of choice. Users can opt in to the virtues of self custody and decentralized P2P payments just like physical cash, without sacrificing mainstream utility. To this end, open-source networks are still incredibly valuable, even if centralized features are needed to interact with them.  The hard reality is that we’ve never had truly full-stack decentralized payments in the first place. In the future, the significant majority of crypto payments will involve custodial products and multiple centralized components. However, using crypto in its many flavors will minimize payment costs, increase optionality and provide more equitable economic access around the world. The more freedom of choice individuals have, the more inclusive money becomes.

42421646,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXojRV,1651003388,Elon Musk Wants to Authenticate Every Twitter User. Crypto Twitter Should Take Notice,"While you may be thinking “Oh great, another newsletter gushing about Elon Musk’s mega-pact to buy Twitter,” that’s not where I’m going here. Instead, there’s much to unpack in the deal in terms of privacy, free speech and regulations. Of course, this assumes the deal actually goes through.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Funding secured (really!)  The narrative  Tesla (TSLA) CEO, SpaceX founder and Boring Company creator Elon Musk has come to terms with the board of Twitter Inc. (TWTR) to acquire the company and take it private.  Why it matters  Twitter occupies a fairly important role in public discourse, particularly in crypto. Musk’s pending takeover of the social media platform is worth watching, especially for anyone who is actually involved in Crypto Twitter.  Breaking it down  Elon Musk bought Twitter*!  (*Almost.)  So the bird site basically has been largely focused on what the CEO of Tesla buying it means for free speech and bots.  Something else caught my eye in the press release announcing the transaction. In a statement, Musk said, “I also want to make Twitter better than ever by … authenticating all humans.”  Does this mean Musk wants to get rid of anonymous accounts entirely? And how would this work in practice?  It seems that “authenticate” here would have to mean collecting some form of personally identifiable information (PII). If it’s as simple as checking a box or filling out a captcha, that doesn’t seem so bad.  It’s another story altogether if “authentication” extends to checking a license or passport or credit card to verify that there is a real human on the other end of the keyboard.  The implications of Twitter, which has suffered cybersecurity breaches in the recent past, collecting PII are troubling. In particular, a large number of Twitter’s users remain pseudonymous or anonymous for various reasons, ranging from just wanting to troll or harass people to having credible fears of posting under their actual identities. As reporter Melissa Chan points out, governments interested in identifying dissidents or activists may try to leverage influence over Musk in ways they could not influence Twitter itself.  A lot of folks may also just not have access to the kinds of IDs that might be needed. This authentication solution would have to account for these individuals.  Musk is known for disliking bots and their potential role on social media, and it would make sense for him to focus on that specific issue (and it is for sure an issue). Authenticating accounts is one way of addressing that.  On the other hand, he also has said he wants to make open source the algorithms that drive Twitter. In and of itself, this won’t change too much – Musk has not committed to making the data that Twitter’s algorithms use to drive their decision-making process public, and that’s probably where the real digital gold lies. On the other hand, it’s hard to reconcile “clamp down on bots” with “here’s the source code.” “Open-source apps usually are easier to make bots for,” says someone I know.  Closing the transaction  The other question I have is whether the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has a role here. And this brings me back to the asterisk from earlier: Musk hasn’t actually bought Twitter yet. He and the Twitter board have agreed to a transaction whereby Musk will acquire Twitter and take it private.  This could take up to six months, according to Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal. Plenty could happen in that time (including Musk changing his mind, which, let’s face it, isn’t exactly out of the realm of possibility).  You see this in the boilerplate language in the addendum to the Form 8-K filed to the SEC: “Additional risks and uncertainties include those associated with: the possibility that the conditions to the closing of the Transaction are not satisfied, including the risk that required approvals from Twitter’s stockholders for the Transaction or required regulatory approvals to consummate the Transaction are not obtained.”  The form also cites the potential for litigation and the “ability of each party to consummate the Transaction.”  In other words, if shareholders sue (or regulators, I suppose) or if it turns out Musk can’t leverage his equity or whatever, the deal could be called off. However, these scenarios don’t seem that likely, based on some informal conversations I’ve had so far.  There's also a question of the form 13G that Musk originally filed. That form is for passive investors who will take no active role in trying to influence the company. Musk later filed a 13D, which does indicate an intent to actively influence the platform, but the SEC will likely have some questions about the order of events here.  Speaking of regulators, the European Union wasted no time in reminding Musk of its own view on social media and digital data.  Per my colleague Jack Schickler, Brussels was quick to warn Musk that he would be subject to EU strictures.  “Be it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules – regardless of their shareholding,” tweeted European Commissioner Thierry Breton. He referred to the Digital Services Act – a newly cast law that requires social media and other online platforms to account for their algorithms, take down unlawful content and protect rights.  Considering Musk has practically made it a side hustle to tweak the noses of regulators, his purchase of a high-profile media platform that will put him squarely in the sights of those same regulators is as ironic as it promises to be entertaining. Pass the popcorn.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  Apparently the Federal Reserve nominees haven’t actually been voted on by the Senate yet. My bad, I thought this happened weeks ago. Votes are expected this week.  Elsewhere:  New York Lawmakers Advance Mining Moratorium Bill to Full Assembly: There has been a lot of panic that this bill would ban bitcoin mining in the state of New York. In reality, it appears the bill will only ban new crypto mining facilities that don’t use renewable energy sources. In other words: Miners using hydro or solar? No problem. Miners using coal or gas? That’s a problem. Existing facilities will not be impacted. The state assembly will vote on it Thursday (if it passes, it will go to the state Senate).  Reggie Fowler Pleads Guilty in Crypto Capital Corp. Case Tied to Bitfinex's Missing Millions: Reginald Fowler, the alleged operator behind Crypto Capital Corp., the “shadow bank” that serviced crypto exchange Bitfinex, pleaded guilty to bank fraud, conspiracy to commit bank fraud, operating an unlicensed money transmitter, conspiracy of the same and wire fraud. He’ll be sentenced in August, and could face a maximum of 90 years in prison.  Outside CoinDesk:  (National Bureau of Economic Research) NBER published an academic paper on El Salvador’s Bitcoin Law.  (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau) The CFPB wants to “examine nonbank financial companies that pose risks to consumers,” it announced recently. Director Rohit Chopra said this specifically means holding these nonbank fintech firms to the same kinds of consumer protection standards that regulated banks are held to. While the release doesn’t explicitly mention crypto, we all know crypto companies are going to be included. A quick glance at the CFPB’s consumer complaints database shows well over 3,000 complaints about crypto companies over the past two years.  (Bloomberg) “I think of myself as like a fairly cynical person. And that was so much more cynical than how I would've described farming. You're just like, well, I'm in the Ponzi business and it's pretty good,” Bloomberg’s Matt Levine told Sam Bankman-Fried after SBF explained yield farming. SBF’s case (overly simplified) is that in a lot of crypto projects there's no underlying value (“economic case,” as Joe Weisenthal put it), but they do well anyway.

42407294,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gVxT2r,1651002838,"Lightning Payments Come to Mobile Games, Fueling Bitcoin Adoption","When you hear “payments in mobile gaming,” maybe you think about “in-game pay-to-play-better” mechanisms where you can get a more powerful character if you just pony up $4.99.  Or, about how you can only move to a certain part of the map for a small payment of $1.99.  Or about how you can only open a certain door with a certain key, which you could get through a five-hour grind in the druid gardens.  Maybe you think about the $14.99 monthly subscription you’re paying for that chess app because you’re totally going to get good at chess soon.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Payments Week.  As games opt for more of these small and microtransactions, Bitcoin’s Lightning Network (Lightning) can clearly play a role. Its commerce layer can handle cheap, fast microtransactions as small as a single satoshi (1/100,000,000th of a bitcoin (BTC), ~$0.0004), allowing players to make easy in-game payments.  But that’s boring. And it doesn’t quite fulfill Bitcoin’s potential.  What is less boring is using the Lightning Network to monetize mobile games in the other direction, allowing players to win money for being good at the game.  That in turn can further and encourage bitcoin adoption, Bitcoin gaming entrepreneurs believe. In this way, some believe that mobile games can act as an effective introduction to bitcoin.  That’s the idea behind companies like THNDR, where Des Dickerson is CEO and co-founder. THNDR is building mobile games where you can earn bitcoin paid out over Lightning. Players of these mobile games are eligible for small, bitcoin-denominated rewards daily based on their game performance in the preceding 24 hours.  Basically, players will earn at least some bitcoin they can claim by withdrawing to a Lightning Network-enabled bitcoin wallet (fees are quite cheap on Lightning).  Read more: The Lightning Network Is Bringing Payments Back to Bitcoin  In an interview with CoinDesk during the Bitcoin Miami conference in April, Dickerson said her company’s mission is to use their games as a way to introduce people to bitcoin. She said that “gaming is becoming the next social network, and I believe that mobile gaming is how we can onboard the most people to bitcoin.”  There’s certainly some truth to that because mobile games are just flat out, incredibly popular. Take Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, for example. You probably haven’t heard of it but it has been downloaded over 1 billion times. But you’ve heard of Halo, and that has only sold 81 million copies worldwide.  Part of this is because of accessibility. In economically developing countries where citizens have less disposable income, expensive PC setups or console systems to play games don’t really make sense. Instead, citizens opt into playing video games on their relatively cheap smartphones (yes, $100 smartphones exist).  Looking at Mobile Legends: Most of its player base hails from countries like Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam and Myanmar. (Side note if you’re keeping count: those countries combined have a population of more than 650 million people.)  If we take a closer look at some of these countries, the profile ties in quite nicely into what THNDR and companies like it are trying to achieve. Personal remittances make up a big piece of the total GDP for the Philippines (9.6%), Vietnam (6.3%) and Myanmar (2.8%). Bitcoin as a means to solving for expensive remittances has been talked about for quite some time and was cited as one of the main points for El Salvador making bitcoin legal tender.  While THNDR isn’t quite yet ready to tackle monetizing a complex Multiplayer Online Battle Arena game (MOBA) like Mobile Legends, it has taken on the hyper-casual and casual game genre. In the same interview, Dickerson gushed about the company’s newest release called “Satsss – Bitcoin Snake,” an homage to the first mobile game ever.  Read more: Crypto Payments: When the Tech Fades to the Background  “If you look at Satsss, our retention is better than other snake games in the App Store and Google Play, so people are playing longer day over day when bitcoin was introduced to the game.”  Retention is an important metric for the business of mobile games and monetizing them with bitcoin, at least on the surface, seems to suggest an overall improvement to the business of the game. But what about the broader mission of bitcoin adoption? How exactly do these games help with that?  The way bitcoin adoption spreads through gaming is getting bitcoin in the hands of people who do not have it yet. Dickerson told us that:  “Gaming is the gateway drug, but what do they do after they get their first bitcoins? After they go and download a wallet, they eventually move on and they start holding their bitcoin in a secure hardware wallet offline … an important step towards more financial self-sovereignty.”  Dickerson is unabashedly proud of this and she fought back tears telling us.  She offered up even more by way of some interesting statistics, including telling us that:  “Women between the ages of 35 and 50 in particular are a huge demographic for mobile gaming, and that’s a demographic that could very much benefit from an introduction to the Bitcoin ecosystem.”  Just as these women could benefit from getting their first bitcoin from a bitcoin-enabled mobile game, so, too, could the mobile gamers from the Philippines we mentioned earlier.  There are a glut of statistics that suggest mobile gaming is big and will continue to get bigger in the future. Given its sheer size, as bitcoin-enabled mobile games continue to penetrate the market it stands a chance in playing an important role in onboarding the next billion bitcoin users.

Key technical points: SAND price shows a fall under the $2.60 support zone. The 100-day EMA falls and warns of a bearish crossover with the 200-day EMA. The 24-hour trading volume of Sandbox is $366.54 Million, marking a 30% fall.

Moreover, the recent sharp bearish strike at the support zone cracks underneath it with an engulfing candle of 5.52%.

Bitcoin NVT Price 28-Day Curve Has Crossed Above The 90-Day As per the latest weekly report from Glassnode, the BTC NVT price model has observed a bullish formation recently. NVT stands for &apos;Network Value to Transaction.&apos; The NVT ratio is an indicator that measures the ratio between the Bitcoin market cap and the network transaction volume. Generally, high values of the ratio suggest that the crypto is overvalued right now. While low ones may imply the coin is undervalued.

42421636,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXojML,1650998680,Don’t Blame Crypto for Corruption,"Is crypto fueling corruption? The International Monetary Fund (IMF) seems to think so. Using crypto usage data from Statista’s Global Consumer Survey, a group of IMF researchers recently found that countries with high crypto adoption tend to be perceived as corrupt.  As to why this relationship exists, the IMF team suggests that crypto is being “used to transfer corruption proceeds."" With crypto facilitating corruption, their advice is the product needs to be regulated, the idea being that regulation – especially know-your-customer requirements – will end graft.  J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.  The IMF has this one backwards. Crypto doesn't fuel corruption. Rather, whatever underlying malaise is fueling corruption is probably also fueling crypto adoption.  Why nations fail  In ""Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty,"" economists Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson offer an explanation for why some nations seem to function well and are relatively free of corruption, like Canada and Sweden, and others do not, like Nigeria and Syria.  Read More: What Crypto Can Learn From Elizabeth Holmes’ Fraud Conviction  It isn't geography or culture that determines success, say the authors, but institutions. By institutions they mean the rules that govern and shape economic and political life: property rights, contract enforcement, licensing standards, financial regulation and more.  Inclusive institutions create the incentives necessary to harness the energy and entrepreneurship of all members of society. Extractive institutions do the opposite. They create a non-level playing field and narrowly concentrate access and benefits for those with political power.  Acemoglu and Robinson offer the city of Nogales, which straddles the U.S.-Mexico border, as an example. “The inhabitants of Nogales Arizona, and Nogales Sonora share ancestors, enjoy the same food and the same music, and … have the same culture,” write the authors. But those on the northern side are prosperous while those on the south suffer from poverty. They suggest this is because U.S. institutions are more inclusive than Mexican ones.  Under Acemoglu and Robinson’s framework, corruption is a by-product, or symptom, of extractive institutions. A profusion of bribes is the return flowing to the small set of politicians, bureaucrats and soldiers who have managed to seize control of a country’s gears.  Regulating crypto is important but it won't fix corruption  Which returns us to crypto. Solving a problem like corruption requires the tearing down of underlying institutions that abet the graft-addicted elites, and their replacement with institutions that actually work for the people. The IMF's prescription for fixing corruption – crypto regulation – is just a cosmetic change. It does nothing to alter the sick institutions driving corruption, poverty and inequality.  If the IMF's prescription is inadequate, I’d suggest that its explanation for the correlation between crypto and corruption is wrong, too.  Instead of crypto fueling corruption, as the IMF seems to think, it's the other way around; the very same extractive institutions that drive corruption are fueling crypto usage. Put differently, the reason we see high rates of crypto adoption in undeveloped nations where elites rig the rules of the game is not because those elites are dealing in crypto bribes, but because the suffering masses see crypto as a form of escape.  Why do people adopt crypto as a reaction to bad institutions? There are two opposing camps. I'll call them crypto-as-redemption and crypto-as-tragedy.  Crypto-as-redemption  For advocates of the crypto-as-redemption viewpoint, the correlation between corruption and crypto adoption is a sign that crypto is acting as a redeeming force. Citizens in corrupt countries are using it as a hack around the extractive institutions that subjugate them.  Take Cuba for instance, a country long bedeviled by extractive institutions. Most Cubans lack connections to the ruling regime. This makes it very difficult to make ends meet, and so they are reliant on remittances from Cuban family members living in the U.S.  Read More: You Would Understand Bitcoin if You Were Under Cuba’s Embargo  But the regime extracts its pound of flesh. Remittances made through Western Union have historically been routed through a set of Cuban-military linked financial companies, which take a cut of around 5%-10% of each remittance for themselves. By avoiding the regime’s intermediaries, crypto provides Cubans with the chance to get better exchange rates.  Crypto also offers a route when those intermediaries cease working altogether. In 2020, the Trump U.S. presidential administration placed sanctions on the military-linked companies involved in remittances, making it difficult for Cubans to send in dollars at all. Some Cuban-Americans turned to couriers, or ""mulas,"" to physically transport cash to relatives. Others used banks in Europe, which were still willing to interact with non-sanctioned Cuban banks.  Crypto emerged as one of these alternative remittance channels. With Western Union down, Cuban Americans could send crypto directly to their relatives who converted it into Cuban currency to buy food and pay bills. For Cuban recipients who don’t want to handle crypto directly, tools like BitRemesas allow local traders to bid for the right to deliver these remittances in person as cash or to their bank account.  And thus crypto became a redemptive force in Cuba, helping fill in the cracks when institutions stop working for people.  Crypto-as-tragedy  The crypto-as-tragedy view takes the opposite view. Most developing nations' crypto usage isn't very redemptive at all. Instead, crypto is a last-gasp gambling venue for the desperate.  Take the case of Nigeria, a country beset by extractive institutions and corruption. Citizens who want to advance in life have fewer options than in the West. They are excluded from many of the official channels that lead to financial advancement: gainful employment, genuine business opportunities and investment. Desperate, they've turned to the only available channel for advancement: get-rich schemes, Ponzis and hyper-volatile crypto.  Read More:Nigeria’s CBDC: The Good, Bad and Ugly  According to Statista crypto adoption data, Nigerians are the most likely of all nationalities to say they used or owned cryptocurrency. Nigeria also happens to be the world capital of the Ponzi scheme. Starting with MMM in 2016, waves of Ponzis have torn through the country including Ultimate Cycler, Icharity Club Nigeria, Get Help World Wide, Givers Forum, Twinkas, Crowd Rising and Loom.  Surveys show that more than half of Nigerians have either participated in a Ponzi or know someone who has. Many are unemployed students, which isn't surprising given Nigeria's 33% unemployment rate. In one survey of Nigerian Ponzi investors, 60.3% cited harsh economic conditions as their reason for joining Ponzi schemes.  For a young Nigerian with few prospects for advancement, a cryptocurrency that promises to moon by 100 times serves the same purpose as a Ponzi scheme like MMM.  If Nigeria’s failed institutions are driving a culture of long-shot financial bets, these bets aren't genuine escapes. Volatile zero-sum games allow citizens to temporarily dissipate their desire to escape their lot in life, but they don't create any real economic value. The elites that control institutions in undeveloped nations may even welcome these sorts of financial games. Not only do they not threaten their control over national resources – they may also distract people from their plight.  And that's why crypto usage is tragic. It is a symptom of an underlying sickness. But just as Nigeria’s Ponzi schemes do nothing to solve the actual problem, neither does its rampant crypto speculation.  Which view is correct, crypto-as-redemption or crypto-as-tragedy?  Both crypto-as-redemption and crypto-as-tragedy counter the simplistic IMF connection between crypto and corruption, suggesting a deeper explanation for the relationship.  Both stories are accurate, to a degree. There are some neat non-speculative crypto use cases where the stuff is being used as a life hack to help those living in dysfunctional nations, such as the example of Cuban crypto remittances. At the same time, a big chunk of developing nation usage involves crypto serving as the focal point for the gambling impulses of the downtrodden, not as a useful life hack or an agent of change.  In its purest form, the crypto-as-redemption view elevates crypto to more than just a personal hack for those coping with bad institutions. Crypto is a peaceful revolution. It sneaks in like a Trojan horse and destroys the extractive institutions that bedevil less-developed nations, setting them free.  While crypto can certainly be a good life hack, this hyper-idealization of crypto is dangerous. It gives people the mistaken idea that a product that serves their gambling instinct can somehow solve the developing world's problems.  To reform the institutions that keep citizens of poor nations, crypto won’t cut it. Deep change requires real work.

42374835,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw30TL,1650997818,Bitcoin Slips Toward $38K After Rally Fizzles,"Bitcoin (BTC), after a price pop on Monday above the crucial psychological level of $40,000, is again flirting with a six-week low.  As of press time, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was down 3.3% in the past 24 hours, trading at $38,210 – close to the lowest since mid-March. The bitcoin price climbed as high as $40,800 earlier Tuesday but dropped more than 5% in the past four hours.  “Bitcoin reversed earlier gains after Russia reportedly suspended gas supplies to Poland,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at the foreign-exchange brokerage Oanda. That's “a sign that war in Ukraine could see further escalations.”  “Bitcoin had a good start following news that Fidelity was planning on offering bitcoin for people’s retirement money, but risk aversion returned as investors remain fixated over aggressive central bank tightening, a worsening Russia-Ukraine war, and a disappointing uptake of using bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador.”  U.S.-based financial services firm Fidelity Investments will allow investors to put bitcoin (BTC) into their 401(k) retirement savings accounts later this year, the firm said on Tuesday. Employers could place a ceiling on the amount of savings earmarked for bitcoin, with the maximum cap expected to be no more than 20%, according to CoinDesk’s Shaurya Malwa.  “Fidelity is the first major retirement-plan provider to do this,” wrote Marcus Sotiriou, Analyst at the UK based digital asset broker GlobalBlock in a newsletter, “And I think it sends a significant message to pension providers. Nobody wants to be first, but nobody wants to be last.”  “Yesterday, the Bitcoin Mining Council released a report which highlighted mining efficiency rose by 63% YoY,” Sotiriou also wrote, “with sustainable energy usage at 58%, marking the fourth quarter in a row above 50%. Furthermore, the network used 25% less energy [year over year].

With the advent of streaming services like Spotify and Pandora, people don&apos;t have to rely on the radio or television to listen to their music or watch the shows they like. Instead, they can pick and choose exactly what they want to watch whenever they want to watch it. This technology has changed the way people consume content, not just in terms of on-demand choices but also in advertising and marketing. A Recent Example Of Blockchain Adoption By Media What if we told you that media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat were working with crypto-powered companies to develop their digital tokens for incentivizing content creation? That&apos;s right: If a post gets a lot of likes, shares, comments—or maybe even retweets—publishers (or creators) will receive tokens. That would give them an incentive to create more content. How do you think social media will look years from now with that incentive in place? Imagine an Internet where users pay for things like premium subscriptions through microtransactions. On YouTube alone, there are billions of views every month. Billions of dollars go into creators&apos; pockets without worrying about third parties taking cuts or causing controversy due to bias.

42421633,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXojKH,1650995996,Twitter Wants to Be a Public Platform,"Amid the Elon Musk-Twitter saga – which reached its apogee yesterday, after the billionaire investor said he will take the popular social media platform private in a $44 billion transaction – came a rise of a new type of political commentator. For them, it’s now clear, for sure, that power and influence and money rule the world – and they want a hand in applying it.  Musk, the Tesla leader, the would-be astronaut, the sometimes-ribald tweeter, has been questioned for his choices. He’s said his piece: Twitter is an important platform that has been corrupted. In taking it out of the public markets, Musk might try to make it again a bastion for “free speech.”  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Many asked why. And some felt the need to make suggestions. Writers, politicians and other public (and private) figures have gone Machiavellian. Apparently, Musk is a boy prince, who knows his power not, who needs to be guided towards right action and proper duty.  “Mirrors for princes,” a literary genre popularized in the Middle Ages, were political treaties that offered coaching and encyclopedic knowledge to shape a sovereign’s rule. Though you’ve maybe read the most popular – Niccolo Machiavelli’s “The Prince” – these works were written for a time and place, and for an audience of one (whoever had the authority to apply its opinions).  See also: Elon Musk Shouldn't Lead Twitter | Opinion  Today, through the internet, everyone essentially has the ability to reach anyone. There’s a sense that we’re all talking past one another, that our ideas get drowned out in the crowd, but no doubt Twitter flattens the realm of speech. And so Musk has insight into what people want, fear and question.  It’s that power that Musk seemingly wants to preserve. He said yesterday, “free speech” is letting his critics thrive on Twitter. These are just words, and as the still undefined leadership role he’ll take there are legitimate concerns they won’t be honored. Twitter, the platform, belongs to all of us – that’s where its value comes from.  Twitter, the company, is a different story. Analysts say it has underperformed, that we could all be fed more advertisements or subscription models. Others raise concerns that this global messaging platform hasn’t done enough to stymie bad actors and scammers: Over its lifetime, Twitter has fostered healthy public debate as well as misinformation and public confusion.  For all its faults, Twitter has certainly grown to become culturally and politically significant. That’s the main takeaway of the Musk-Twitter story – we all care about this platform because it’s important and don’t want it to be misled.  Yesterday, former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey condoned Musk’s plan and pledged his support for this “singular” individual. But Dorsey, too, held up a mirror for Musk to gaze into – he might be the leader for the job, but the job is ultimately unnecessary.  “In principle, I don’t believe anyone should own or run Twitter. It wants to be a public good at a protocol level, not a company,” Dorsey tweeted.  What that looks like is still up for debate. Although Musk is getting people to ask what they want from Twitter, he’s also stirring a feeling that changes to the code – though, perhaps, necessary – should be up to the will of one man.  Twitter the protocol “could enable different users to choose different styles of content moderation,” tech blogger Casey Newton wrote. There are many reasons why social media applications should or should not run on a blockchain. But “open sourcing” the algorithm and granting people the authority to order their feed, not just choose who they follow, is far past due.  See also: Twitter Seeks Senior Crypto Role on Heels of NFT Verification  Musk called Twitter the modern-day public square. There are a lot of things separating the digital age from the medieval, but the biggest is that authority and governance has shifted largely from princes(ses) to the people. No one writes manuals for rulers anymore, but self-help books chart.  If I were writing a mirror for Musk, I might first write a practical guide to managing “buyer’s remorse.” It will be a tough road ahead, Musk will always have critics and managing global discourse is almost impossible.  But Dorsey already said it all. Twitter wants to be a public protocol, and in many ways, it already operates like one. So why again is everyone writing political manuals about the Musk-Twitter saga? Well, I guess, money still rules us all.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/04/26/twitter-wants-to-be-a-public-platform,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/232cbf28a63e076c0ca3b47b76881b6068808875-640x427.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

ILV prices may fall to Q1 2022 lows if bulls fail to flow back. Past Performance of ILV The Illuvium token is in red, dropping seven percent in the previous trading week and trailing the USDT. Despite earlier gains on April 25, the ILV price is bearish. Notably, prices are snapping back to last week&apos;s trend as sellers set sight on retesting Q1 2022 lows of around $475. Technically, the wide-ranging bear bar of April 26 canceling previous bullish attempts is setting the momentum for more losses in the immediate term. Illuvium Technical Analysis The current bear bar appears to be rewinding gains of April 25, continuing the selling pressure of last week. With ILV bear bars banding near the lower BB and moving in the direction determined by sellers of April 11, every retracement towards $530 or today&apos;s highs provides an entry for traders targeting $475. Therefore, if sellers press on, further losses below the critical support at $475 open up the ILV token for more dumps towards all-time lows of around $410. Ideally, Illuvium buyers will be in control provided prices trend above $550. The breakout should be with high trading volumes and preferably wide-ranging, setting the foundation for a leg up towards $670—April 2022 highs. What to Expect from ILV?

42421643,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXojQT,1650991945,"NFTs, the New 'Social Media Playbook'","It’s impossible to predict whether GameStop shifting its failing business model to involve NFTs will pay off in the end, but it certainly is symbolic of a shifting paradigm. On the back of NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, a thousand corporate flowers may bloom and a thousand more may falter.  These unique, digital assets – often associated with cartoon animals and “rug pulls” – are a new technological standard. One that helps link creators and fans closer together by removing the middleman.  Eric Lam is a portfolio manager at Mirana Ventures and formerly ran NFT strategy at Universal Music Publishing Group.  So where then does “the company” fit in this new world of NFTs? Well, speaking from experience, companies are still figuring it out. There are as many diverse strategies for using NFTs as there are “social media playbooks.”  Crypto native companies like Autograph, OpenSea and Dapper Labs are obviously optimistic about the future of NFTs. But so are traditional media companies like Universal Music, which recently signed a new NFT music group and bought its own Bored Ape.  Read more: Universal Music Group Files 4 Trademarks for Its Bored Ape Band Leader  Traditional talent agencies UTA and CAA are beginning to sign NFT projects and are figuring out how to leverage that intellectual property (IP) to create additional derivative works of art.  In other words, major corporations are taking NFTs seriously. Not every company, mind you. But considering it’s an asset class that was created less than a decade ago, people are still trying to make sense of it.  Crafting a thesis and being flexible is the only way forward for companies looking to capitalize on the digital economy. Either by creating their own corporate-owned NFT projects or by hitching their wagon to a popular project, corporations are committed to their involvement in the growth of the NFT ecosystem.  As the NFT space continues to change, new projects are beginning to push the technological limits and starting to show the world their true power and potential.  New models  Like many other disruptive technologies of the internet age, NFTs are changing the ways you can choose to interact with other people as well as brands. The general trend of the World Wide Web has been more choices, more potential relationships and more ownership.  This logic is playing out in the realm of NFTs, which enable token holders to earn a stake in the companies they support.  There are multiple projects that are pushing the capabilities of NFT technology and strengthening the relationship between token holder and creator.  Projects like the Bored Ape Yacht Club, managed by the incorporated company Yuga Labs, transfer intellectual property ownership rights to their buyers. As a buyer, if you want to make a movie about your cartoon ape, you can because you own it.  Read more: For Universal’s NFT Band, Music Is Second to Brand Identity  Jenkins the Valet is one such NFT project that is taking advantage of this new ownership model. Recently created by one of the members of the Bored Ape Yacht Club community, and now under the incorporated company Tally Labs, the vision for Jenkins the Valet is to create a crowdsourced IP licensing syndicate.  Jenkins the Valet is a character in the wider world of the Bored Ape Yacht Club, one of the most successful NFT projects to date and recently valued at over $4 billion after a funding round led by famed venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Jenkins is quickly growing into its own identifiable brand.  In Hollywood, traditionally, companies like UTA and ICM sign actors, artists and other talent to represent through different mediums like film and TV. Jenkins presents a new vision: Sell 6,942 NFTs that give holders the right to license their token-based intellectual property, and Tally Labs, at the direction of the 6,942 members, will create new intellectual property around it.  The creators of Jenkins the Valet signed a deal with CAA, one of the biggest talent agencies in Hollywood, to manage its newly created IP. They hired New York Times bestselling author Neil Strauss to write a book based on this IP. Royalty sales of the book will trickle down to the community. Soon, Tally Labs is looking to get into podcasting and other media.  Tally Labs is essentially creating a Web 3 talent agency, where for the price of an NFT, anyone can be a talent agent, capable of licensing in their NFTs or doing deals with others with valuable NFT IP, who don’t own a Jenkins the Valet NFT.  It’s this coordination from communities that can truly shake up the entertainment industry, yielding to vast worlds of creative, interrelated projects. It’s no wonder why corporations, as well as everyday people, are looking to capitalize on NFTs: Each new project only strengthens this entire economy. It could be a cost-free way to earn revenues and develop your brand.  The Bored Ape Yacht Club, which captured lightning in a bottle and kicked off this economy, is further experimenting with crypto in an attempt to benefit its community.  The Club is building play-to-earn games, which enable people to play video games using their Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs. They also launched ApeCoin (APE), their ecosystem’s native crypto that holders can redeem for additional products and merch. ApeCoin is similar to “Chuck E. Cheese” tokens with a twist: The tokens can be liquidated on an exchange like Coinbase or FTX.  Some Bored Ape holders earned as much as $100,000, and the Bored Ape Yacht Club was able to ensure that only true fans (token holders) received their allocation by using the information in smart contracts to authenticate and prove ownership.  The future  The permissionless nature of NFTs has the potential to reshape interactions between fans and creators, as now fans can take part in a project's financial upside. Said a little differently, NFTs combine cryptocurrency + culture + social status.  NFTs are not just art, they’re a new medium in which creators can have financial interaction with their supporters. This could be used to crowdsource businesses, independently represent music projects and so much more. The creative opportunities are endless.  One company may issue a 1 of 50 gaming item as an NFT. Another company can integrate that gaming item into their game and allow users to connect their virtual wallet to the video game, allowing them to bring that new gaming item into the subsequent game.  As creators and entrepreneurs continue to experiment with blockchain and NFT technology, there is a high probability that there will be increasingly abstract projects that exponentially rise in value due to their precedent-setting impact.  See also: Recapturing the 'Revolution' With a Beatles Muse's NFTs | Opinion  Continuing to follow the space can help set you up to understand these projects once they emerge and position you to take advantage of the opportunities as they present themselves.  Just like Amazon and eBay came out of the internet bubble, the same will most likely happen with NFTs.

42423441,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2ZqJh,1650991333,FalconX Tests Waters as First Full-Fledged Crypto Derivatives Dealer,"When FalconX formally registered as a U.S. swap dealer this month, the crypto startup became the first of its kind to enter what CEO Raghu Yarlagadda contends is a massive, underserved market. Despite the advantages of being there first, he says he hopes competitors will join in.  “The demand is huge,” Yarlagadda said in an interview. “I really hope other players also come in, because it’s the right thing for the industry.”  The arrival of a native crypto business as a broker registered with the National Futures Association – and the oversight from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that comes with it – could mark a significant stage in mainstreaming crypto. But as Anchorage Digital recently illustrated as the first crypto firm to get a federally approved banking charter, being first also comes with unique pressures and vulnerability to regulatory sanctions if they come up short.  FalconX is akin to a financial wholesaler that serves only institutional clients, such as hedge funds and other financial firms that want to give clients access to crypto derivatives – contracts in which parties make a deal with each other to buy or sell an asset under certain conditions. As a swap dealer, FalconX can join the ranks of major Wall Street banks, such as Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), in providing a service for customers who want to acquire or unload derivatives. In an early crypto foray last year, Goldman Sachs began offering bitcoin (BTC) futures trading.  Crypto derivatives are much like the traditional financial industry’s futures and options overseen by the CFTC. But Yarlagadda said institutional customers have been waiting for brokers to fill their needs for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives.  “Ninety-nine percent of futures trading is outside the U.S. despite a sizable portion of institutions being in the U.S,” Yarlagadda said of the current crypto derivatives market. “These institutions are taking a lot of risk, because these external entities, they’re not under jurisdictions as sophisticated as the U.S.”  As recently as two years ago, the vast majority of his San Mateo, California-based company’s customers were cryptocurrency businesses. Now, he said, most of them aren’t native to crypto. Mainstream financial firms have been drawn in by – among other things – their never-ending search for higher yielding investments.  “A lot of traditional institutions are coming to FalconX,” Yarlagadda said.  A swap dealer in the U.S. has to register when it’s transacting at least $8 billion in contracts a year. Yarlagadda said demand will far outstrip that threshold, and the company is working with the industry’s global trade group, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, on figuring out what typical crypto contracts should look like.  “Our priority is to develop standard terms for products that are already traded, such as cash-settled forwards and options referencing bitcoin and ether [ETH],” ISDA CEO Scott O’Malia said last month, adding that his organization is trying to set up templates for on-chain smart contracts. He said the association is working with the market players “including our newest crypto asset members, and we encourage other market participants interested in joining the conversation to get in touch.”  Fierce volatility and other complications unique to crypto markets “could theoretically be addressed by robust margin requirements and risk management,” said Dan Awrey, a professor who teaches derivatives policy at Cornell Law School. Still, he added that “smaller firms, with fewer counterparties and exposure to highly correlated market risks, are ultimately at a higher risk of default than many incumbent firms.”  Also, dealers clearing and settling trades with distributed ledger technology could “face unique operational and cybersecurity risks stemming from, among other things, reliance on oracles and technologically hardwired margin requirements that may limit counterparty flexibility in times of distress,” Awrey said.  FalconX is preparing itself for the kind of disclosures, audits and scrutiny that come with dealer registration. For the next two quarters, the company will be hard at work “to continue to build that infrastructure,” Yarlagadda said.  The industry is also closely watching the CFTC’s consequential decision over whether to approve an application from FTX.US allowing the company to directly clear its customers’ margin-backed derivatives. The agency is said to be holding for a roundtable meeting next month to discuss the idea, and it's fixed on May 25 for that public discussion, according to a person familiar with the plan.

The round was led by Courtside Ventures and Wave Financial, with participation from Gary Vaynerchuk’s Vaynerfund and celebrities Diplo, Gmoney, Pussy Riot’s Nadya and NFT artist Justin Aversano, according to a Tuesday press release.  The Holograph suite will include three initial products – Bridge, Core and Mint.  Bridge allows NFTs to be transferred between Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchains. Core is a multichain application programming interface (API) for software developers, and Mint is a minting interface aimed at creators.  The CXIP Labs protocol has been used to deploy NFT drops from Sotheby’s Metaverse and Nifty Gateway, as well as the UkraineDAO NFT project, which raised almost $7 million to support Ukraine in its war against Russia.  “The CXIP Labs team has a proven background in supporting artists’ rights across creative industries, Web 3 fundamentals and a vision of the future for creators informed by some of the smartest people in Web 3,” Gary Vaynerchuk, founder of VaynerFund, said in the press release.  The project is tapping celebrity support from every angle, adding musicians Pharrell Williams and Joe Jonas to its advisory board.

42423442,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2ZqLh,1650989382,Fort Worth to Become First US City to Mine Bitcoin,"Fort Worth, the fifth-largest city in Texas, will become the first U.S. city to start mining bitcoin (BTC) via a new pilot project. The project was approved in a vote by the city council on Tuesday as part of a larger docket of crypto-friendly initiatives.  According to a statement, the city has partnered with the Texas Blockchain Council (TBC), an advocate for blockchain technology in the state, for the program. Fort Worth will maintain three Bitmain S9 mining computers in a climate-controlled location in the Information Technology Solutions Department Data Center located at Fort Worth City Hall, where they will be housed on a private network to minimize security risk. The mining rigs were donated by TBC.  “These small but powerful machines mark Fort Worth’s larger commitment to becoming a leading hub for technology and innovation,” said Mayor Mattie Parker. The city aims to experiment with the mining process through this pilot program and will evaluate it again in six months. Crypto software and services company Luxor Technologies and bitcoin miner Rhodium Enterprises are providing strategic guidance for the city’s pilot project.  Bitmain’s Antminer S9 machines are one of the oldest and cheapest bitcoin mining machines available and popular among new miners. Currently, S19 models are more popular among more advanced and industrial-grade miners.  “By starting small to learn as they go, Fort Worth is positioning itself to be the bitcoin mining capital of Texas,” said Texas Blockchain Council (TBC) President and founder Lee Bratcher.  After China’s sweeping ban of the crypto sector last year, the U.S., particularly Texas, has become the dominant hub for miners due to its cheap power and mining-friendly local legislations. Fort Worth’s move is likely to further help the bitcoin-friendly jurisdiction narrative of the state, which comes at a time when both global and other state-level policymakers are pushing for more regulations for the miners.

42407292,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gVxSzY,1650986890,"Fast, Fluid, Frictionless Payments Are the Future","How does it go from something only a few people use to something everyone uses without even thinking about it? For over a decade people have wondered whether crypto was on the brink of a major breakout into the mainstream. Crypto pundits predicted it would soon be everywhere and easy to use. But we haven't gotten there yet. Time and again, the pundits and prognosticators told us this was crypto's defining moment but it never really materialized. We're still just trading currencies in an endless loop and flipping some JPEGs.  So what will it take to really rocket crypto to the next level?  Time and evolution.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Payments Week. Dan Jeffries is an author, futurist, systems architect and thinker.  For a technology to really hit the big time, it has got to evolve. Right now, we're still in the early adopter phase of crypto. It's hard to acquire, hard to use for most non-tech folks and it's lacking a whole bunch of features.  To get to the next level a technology has to offer all the features of the old version of the tech, in this case analog-fiat money, and then surge forward to offer new features the old tech simply can't match.  Take something like the shift of film from analog to digital. In the early days of digital cameras, analog film still had massive advantages. It was higher resolution with much better color fidelity. Analog cameras took pictures instantly, while early digital cameras had a slight delay. You pushed the button and waited, hoping your subject didn't move and leave you with a blurry mess. Forget about photographing sports or dancing in the early days. It just wouldn't work.  But, over time, digital technology got better and better. The chips got smaller and faster. The resolution got higher and higher. Digital cameras took pictures instantly. Suddenly digital tech had all the power of analog tech. But that wasn't good enough. Digital film matched the old technology's features but didn't offer a truly compelling reason to switch for most people.  The inflection point in a new technology's evolution comes when it delivers brand new features that the old tech can never match. That happened when digital cameras got so good that you didn't even need a big bulky, special purpose camera anymore. Miniaturization took hold and companies could suddenly put a lightning fast camera into another new technology: a smart phone.  Suddenly, people had a high definition picture taker in their pocket. The software bundled with it let them edit photos on the fly and zip them around the world on a global information network. They could take tens of thousands of photos and send them to friends and family and post them online. You couldn't do any of that with your bulky old film camera. And in short order analog film was consigned to the scrap heap of history and Kodak was bankrupt after 100 years of total dominance. Kodak even invented digital photography in the 1970s but failed to see the significance of the invention.  Fast forward to our Instagram- and TikTok-saturated world of today and it feels like the age of analog film was a million years ago, not a few decades ago. That's how fast a new technology can trounce an old technology once it hits that magical inflection point of cutting edge new features.  For crypto payments to really take off, we'll need a similar evolution that mirrors the evolution of digital film.  Read More: Crypto Payments: When the Tech Fades to the Background  What Will It Take for Crypto to Really Boom?  First we have to match the old features of fiat. Global scale. Ubiquity. Speed. Easy exchange. Stability.  We've made good progress with new wave crypto projects like Solana that can scale to 65,000 transactions per second. That matches Visa's (V) scale and blows it away when it comes to pricing. The fees on the Solana network are tiny, averaging just $0.00025 per transaction. Because Visa scalps 2%-3% of the top of every transaction, eventually they won't be able to compete with a fast, fluid payment system where the transaction fees are utterly miniscule.  But it's not good enough. We've started to match the old technology but we haven't given people a compelling reason to switch. There's nothing new here just yet. So what will it take to get us to the next level?  The catalyst for digital currencies might be something totally unexpected that's nearly impossible to see now. Maybe it will take a mashup with another developing technology like artificial intelligence (AI), in a way we won't see until it hits us right in the face. But there are some candidates that may make fast and fluid future payment systems a reality.  One potential trend to watch is the decline of the advertising empire and the surveillance economy that powers it. Everywhere people are getting fed up with ads that stalk them wherever they go. Governments are threatening to ban targeted advertising. Apple (AAPL) recently crushed advertisers’ ability to track people on iPhones and Facebook's (FB) revenue crumbled in the quarter that followed. Facebook (now Meta), Google (GOOG) and other digital behemoths own their power to highly targeted ads and, if that power gets ripped away, their revenue collapses along with it.  If advertising revenue falls apart tech firms will need another way to make money. One powerful possibility for replacing that revenue is microtransactions.  Think of it as ""subscription everything.""  You used to buy software and now you just rent it. The same goes for movies and music. Most people don't buy DVDs anymore and own a movie. They rent it for $3 or watch it as part of their subscription bundle on Netflix, Disney+ or Hulu or 1000 other streaming services.  Tomorrow we might have a subscription for everything from our car, to our bike, to our PlayStation to the content we lap up on the web. The web is the key. A pay-as-you-go model could swiftly replace the ad model. We saw that as IT shifted from personal data centers to the cloud. Suddenly, leasing beat out ownership. It's one of the reasons Facebook and PayPal (PYPL) and others tried to make libra before the U.S. government crushed them. They saw the end of their ad revenue coming. They figured if they had a universal currency they could control, with payments zipping around over Whatsapp and streaming to Instagram influencers hawking beauty products and energy drinks, they'd have an alternative river of revenue. It's the same reason Facebook changed its name to Meta and why it's trying to carve out a foothold in the mythical metaverse.  Read More: The History of Cash-Like Digital Payment Instruments  Facebook may have failed at launching libra but someone else will create the same system. They'll figure out how to slip it under the radar of raging industry critics like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). They'll slip it in the back door without calling attention. We won't even realize they've built a fast and fluid payment system until we're all using it. Maybe we already have it with the Lightning network and it just needs to evolve? Or maybe it’s something else entirely, still on the drawing board or incubated in a lab somewhere, but it’s coming. And suddenly we'll have a fast and flexible digital currency that's easy to send and receive for virtually any product on Earth. In turn, it will open brand new avenues of commerce. Instead of having the ugly subscription models, we have today it will get much simpler.  Take something like Spotify. You won't even have to sign up to a service like that. You'll just have a digital ID and a wallet. Your ID will exchange with a site transparently and invisibly and you'll start listening to music instantly. No more paywall and setting up another password you'll forget. It won't be a flat fee either. It will vary based on how much you use. Maybe one month you barely listen to Spotify and you end up paying the equivalent of $3 in crypto but the next month you go on a road trip and throw a raging house party and you wrack up $15 in payments.  As the advertising empire falls, we'll likely have this frictionless kind of pay-as-we-go model for websites and apps. Instead of joining a website and giving them your information, you'll just go to a website, read a few articles over the course of the month and your digital wallet will stream payments for those articles. Sometimes a site won't need any information at all and you can just stream cash and read away without any ID exchange.  Some services will almost certainly demand a know-your-customer (KYC)-style mandate from the government, but ID exchange will still be automated. You'll already have done your KYC and it will record in your wallet and disappear into the background. The protocol will exchange your info and you won't have a thousand passwords for a thousand different sites anymore.  You won't have to authorize the payment either because you'll have set a monthly entertainment threshold right in your wallet heuristics and as long as the payments don't go over you'll just start reading. If you get close to your limit it will warn you to increase it or you'll run out of entertainment budget until next month. That will make reading and listening to music and watching TV and movies frictionless, unlike now, where you have to bust out a credit card, fill in a bunch of information and join each site with a fresh username and password.  Read More: Why Banks and Payment Processors Shun Perfectly Legal Businesses  Today's paywalls mean you usually won't bother reading when you hit a paywall. It's just too much hassle. Unless a site delivers incredibly good content, why wouldn't you just move on and read something else? Usually the only sites that get a subscription today are sites you really, really like. It took me a few years of missing The Economist in print to get a subscription and that was after I'd clicked on about 30 different social media shared stories from The Economist that I wanted to read and just never bothered because the barrier to subscription was too high.  But tomorrow paying for things invisibly with little to no friction may just be the catalyst that vaults crypto into the mainstream.  There's only one big problem.  There are powerful forces that don't want it to happen at all.  Not Everyone Hates the Middleman  Crypto is unique and it inspires fear and rage in its opponents. It faces fierce headwinds from forces that want to crush and cripple its evolution by any means necessary.  When it comes to a technology like digital cameras, there aren't a lot of people trying to strangle the development of the technology in its crib. It developed smoothly along its natural evolutionary curve. Crypto is different. It's a threat to a lot of powerful entities, most notably many governments and that could cripple the frictionless payment dream if we're not careful. Frictionless payments are all about cutting out the middleman and making the movement of money easy.  Of course, you may want to cut out the middleman but governments love a middleman.  One person's biggest benefit is another person's darkest fear. Governments love an intermediary because intermediaries are choke points. Put pressure on that choke point and you control the entire system without having to control each node individually. That's the primary function of government. Control. It makes the rules and makes sure everyone is playing by the rules.  Controlling the payment network is a powerful weapon, as we've seen with Russia's violent assault on Ukraine. Within days of the start of the war, the entire world had cut Russia off from the SWIFT network, and seized and froze Russia assets worldwide. The sanctions had a devastating impact almost immediately.  The sanctions went into effect over the weekend and by Monday, when the markets opened, the ruble had collapsed. The Russian central bank could do nothing to stop it. Usually a central bank steps in to buy up a currency that's falling, stabilizing it but with the central bank's gold, silver and foreign currency assets but with all those secondary assets frozen in banks outside of their control they could do nothing but watch the ruble burn.  It's new-wave economic warfare for a hyper-connected world.  As news of sanctions broke, crypto enthusiasts joyfully jumped into the fray saying ""this is what crypto is built for, nobody can cut off crypto payments."" It was exactly the wrong message at the wrong time. When the whole world unites against a hideous crime and even historically neutral Switzerland joined the sanction efforts, the last message you want to be shouting to the rafters is that your new technology can make sanctions impossible.  Like clockwork, Sen. Warren sent a letter to the Treasury department warning that Russia may use crypto to avoid sanctions.  At the heart of that message is fear of a loss of control. The more payments become frictionless and the more choke points disappear the more powerful forces want to ram payments back through those choke points. A truly distributed system is incredibly hard to control because you have to attack each individual node rather than simply blockading the choke points like an army controlling the Khyber Pass.  Decentralized crypto faces existential pressure that most technologies just don't face. That pressure will continue to shape crypto as it continues to develop over the coming years.  The question is whose dream will win?  Will we have fast, fluid, frictionless payments flying around the world at the speed of light? Or will we have rigid choke points controlling the money at every step, forcing us to authenticate at every step, while it tracks from cradle to grave?  Read More: The Lightning Network Is Bringing Payments Back to Bitcoin  The vision of simple, easy payments everywhere is no pipe dream. It would level up commerce exponentially, making money surge faster than a trillion bullet trains around the world. Ditching plastic cards and doing away with dedicated terminals will make doing business much, much easier. Take away the middleman and you've got a system anyone can opt into with ease, even the unbanked and those who can’t access the system now. No card. No dumb black box to swipe it in. Just a silent exchange between your wallet and the app or site, giving you exactly what you want, when you want it.  But to do that it has got to overcome the people who want to keep the middle man at all costs and who will keep trying to crush crypto’s neck under dark black boots.  Time will tell who will win. In the long run, we'll have digital currencies no matter what. The real question is will they be central bank digital currencies (CBDC), controlled by nation-states, panopticons that peer into every aspect of our lives. Or will they be decentralized currencies controlled by heuristics and consensus building and a distributed network of zero trust serve us tirelessly every single second of every single day?  Then again, maybe it won't be one or the other.  As Forrest Gump once said: ""I think maybe it's both. Maybe both is happening at the same time.""

However, there&apos;s no denying that blockchain is starting to gain traction within the insurance industry. This can mean big things for both insurers and their customers alike.

There is also many other potential insurance uses, like smart contracts to automate benefits calculations and payout approvals. If you pay your insurance premium on time and stay accident-free, a smart contract could automatically increase your deductible or reduce your coverage limits if needed.

Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Bitcoin's recovery stalls. A trader says the cryptocurrency could gravitate toward the so-called ""max pain"" point ahead of monthly options expiry.  Chartist's Corner: Dogecoin eyes breakout.  And check out the CoinDesk TV show “First Mover,” hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern time.  Henri Arslanian, global crypto leader, PwC  Ming Wu, founder and CEO, Strips Finance  Dave Abner, global head of business development, Gemini  Market Moves  Bitcoin took a breather early Tuesday, marking a weak follow-through to Monday's impressive recovery from the six-week low of $38,210 to $40,600.  The momentum stalled even as U.S.-based financial services firm Fidelity Investments said it would allow investors to put bitcoin (BTC) in their 401(k) retirement savings accounts later this year. Observers cheered the news, saying the passive bid from 401(k)s would be massive and accelerate mainstream adoption. More than 20,000 companies reportedly use Fidelity to administer retirement accounts.  ""Fidelity are the first major retirement-plan provider to do this, and I think it sends a significant message to pension providers – nobody wants to be first, but nobody wants to be last,"" Marcus Sotiriou, analyst at the U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, said in an email.  In another development, the Bitcoin Mining Council's quarterly report published Monday said mining efficiency rose by 63% year on year in the first three months, with sustainable energy usage at 58%. The network used 25% less energy even as the hashrate or the computing power dedicated to the blockchain rose. ""These improvements are appealing for institutions who see the environmental impact as one of the biggest reasons not to invest in bitcoin,"" Sotiriou said.  Perhaps renewed weakness in stock markets and caution ahead of next week's Federal Reserve meeting kept buyers at bay. Futures tied to the S&P 500 pointed to a negative open with a 0.4% drop, and European stocks struggled to stabilize after Monday's slide.  ""The recovery attempt of risk appetites, reflected in the recovery and strong close in U.S. stocks yesterday, was dealt a blow by Russia's Foreign Minister's warning of a serious danger of nuclear conflict,"" Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, said in an email.  Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader from crypto asset management firm Blofin, said, ""It's going to be difficult for the crypto market to make new highs. The Fed's May meeting is imminent, and bearish sentiment still dominates the market.""  Markets expect the Fed to lift the benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points (0.5 percentage point) to a range between 0.75% and 1% at next week's meeting. The central bank kicked off the tightening cycle last month with a 25 basis point rate hike.  Ardern added that bitcoin and ether prices might be biased toward max pain levels ahead of Friday's monthly options expiry. According to data tracked by Skew, bitcoin options worth $2.2 billion and ether options worth $1.2 billion are set to expire this Friday. The max pain for bitcoin and ether is $41,000 and $3,000, respectively.  The max pain is the price level at which option buyers would suffer the most loss on expiry. The theory is that the max pain acts as a magnet while heading into the expiry as option sellers, typically large institutions, buy or sell the underlying asset to keep the price around key levels to inflict maximum loss on buyers. The phenomenon is quite popular in the currency markets.  While skeptics may say the crypto options market is still too small to impact the spot price, bitcoin has in the past gravitated toward the max pain point ahead of monthly and quarterly expiries.

However, recent trends indicate that the next few years will significantly disrupt the status quo. Although most of the change will be driven by traditional technology, such as 5G and edge computing, blockchain has also been proposed as an ideal solution to many of the biggest problems facing the telecommunications industry. These problems include privacy and security issues, network control and ownership, and many more. This article will review how blockchain will change our world in general and specifically how it could revolutionize telecommunications. History Of The Evolution In Telecommunications The telecommunications industry has changed in several ways over time. The first telephones were installed in England in 1879. Still, it was quickly realized that wires were not enough to get electricity from one place to another - something with better range and reliability was needed. So electromagnetism took over, and we began building everything with copper-wire telegraphs (and later telephone lines). However, even that wasn&apos;t enough. We soon saw that electromagnetic waves needed a medium to carry them through space. Thus, the wireless came into being. We now use electromagnetic wave propagation to move information around without wires or cables at all!

42407295,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gVxT6A,1650981101,The Lightning Network Is Bringing Payments Back to Bitcoin,"In the fall of 2008, the white paper ""Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,"" authored by Satoshi Nakamoto, circulated on a cryptography mailing list. As signaled by the title, it proposed a protocol for creating an electronic cash system without the need for intermediaries or trust. Some months later, in January 2009, the first-ever Bitcoin block was mined.  There was no block size limit on the Bitcoin network in the very beginning. To prevent network spamming and the blockchain size increasing exponentially, a block size limit of 1MB was introduced. The Bitcoin Network has maintained its small block size and long blocktime to keep the network decentralized through tumultuous times with considerable disagreements.  Anders Helseth is a senior analyst at Arcane Research. This article is part of CoinDesk’s Payments Week series.  The limited throughput capacity of the Bitcoin blockchain makes small payments expensive  The Bitcoin Network's decentralized and secure design, with a small block-size and relatively long blocktime, does not come without drawbacks. The transaction capacity of the Bitcoin blockchain is far too low for using bitcoin payments on a large scale. The Bitcoin blockchain’s practical throughput is seven transactions a second on average. In comparison, the Visa payment network processed 5,200 transactions on average per second in 2021.  Also, payment confirmation on the Bitcoin Network takes time. A new block is mined, on average, every 10 minutes, and it’s standard to require a transaction to be included in several mined blocks for a transaction to be considered confirmed.  The limited space on the blockchain means that transactions compete to be included in a block. Miners will want to maximize their income and pick the transactions that give them the highest fees. With the current demand for transactions, transaction fees become disproportionally high for smaller payments.  The Lightning Network enables small and instant bitcoin payments in large numbers  The Lightning Network solves the limited throughput capacity of bitcoin payments on the Bitcoin blockchain and dramatically decreases the transaction fees on smaller payments. Utilizing the Lightning Network, millions of people can send fractions of a bitcoin at instant speed – at the same time.  The Lightning Network is a network of payment channels; each channel is opened with one transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain. Once a channel is opened, the two counterparties in a channel can sign updated bitcoin transactions redistributing the value of the opening blockchain transaction.  The beauty of the Lightning Network is that these updated bitcoin transactions don't have to be broadcasted to the blockchain and hence do not take blockspace or require miner fees. But the updated transactions still have value because they could be broadcasted to the Bitcoin blockchain as a valid Bitcoin transaction.  Read More: Jack Mallers’ Strike Announces Shopify Integration for Bitcoin Lightning Payments  The network component enters through how payments are relayed between people not having a direct connection through a payment channel. As long as you are connected to a person who is connected to the recipient (you can add more jumps here), your payment can be performed off-chain through all channels along the route, signing updated and valid Bitcoin transactions.  Use of the Lightning Network is increasing fast  The use of the Lightning Network is somewhat of a blackbox due to the protocol design. Therefore, most are left to look at imperfect public metrics to gauge the growth in Lightning Network usage. In our newly published report, The State of Lightning Volume 2, we estimate how much the Lightning Network is used for payments.  The number of payments on the Lightning Network has roughly doubled, compared to a year ago, while the value of the payments has increased by more than 400%, measured in U.S. dollars.  Stripping away trading-related payments, which vary significantly in volume with market sentiment, we see that the increase in commerce payments and personal transfers has been even higher. And significantly, they are on a continuous upwards slope.  Several other factors point to great potential for further increased adoption of the Lightning Network. We estimated that just over 100,000 users had access to Lightning payments globally last summer. In March 2022, we estimate more than 80 million people had access to Lightning payments on an installed application.  Read More: PayPal’s Blockchain Chief on the Future of Crypto in Payments  Users with access to Lightning payments are not the same as active users. It's, for instance, reasonable to believe, and the numbers back it up, that most of the users of popular payment apps that recently implemented Lightning payments still don't use Lightning. However, more user access increases the likelihood of more widespread use. And the possibilities of using bitcoin payments over Lightning are growing, as highlighted by a flurry of Lightning integration announcements at Bitcoin 2022.  The numbers indicate that a meager percentage of bitcoin holders use it for payments  BitPay, likely one of the most used payment processors for non-trading-related bitcoin payments, reported it processed close to 40,000 bitcoin transactions in February. Our data shows more than 700,000 non-trading-related payments on the Lightning Network in the same month. Therefore, in terms of numbers of transactions, it’s not too far-fetched to think that the Lightning Network is close to rivaling or surpassing the Bitcoin Network in non-trading related payments.  Despite rising quickly, comparing these transaction numbers to the number of bitcoin holders, most bitcoin holders still use it solely as an investment vehicle. Crypto.com estimates that there are close to 180 million bitcoin owners globally. Comparing this number with the number of non-trading-related bitcoin payments indicates that a minuscule share of bitcoin holders use bitcoin as a medium of exchange.  The Lightning Network is essential to fulfilling Satoshi Nakamoto’s original vision  The Bitcoin white paper presents a solution for creating a payment network not reliant on trust or an intermediary. Nowhere in the white paper is it stated that Bitcoin is designed to be an investment vehicle with enormous returns that eventually will outcompete all other money and swallow the value of other investment vehicles. The numbers, however, clearly indicate that a version of the latter is the motivation for most bitcoin “users.”  The current investment-driven demand for Bitcoin transactions is high enough to make fees unreasonably high also for many commerce payments that wouldn’t need instant confirmation. Therefore, the Lightning Network is not only about allowing a greater number of transactions and transaction speed but also making bitcoin payments cheap enough to be used.  To keep small blocks and a long blocktime, a solution like the Lightning Network is essential if Bitcoin is to be a payment option in line with Satoshi Nakamoto’s original vision.

42407298,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gVxdL0,1650978940,Why Haven't Crypto Payments Taken Off?,"Editor's note: As part of CoinDesk’s Payments Week, we asked a number of engineers, executives and experts to weigh in on the substantial issues raised by the crypto industry. In this roundtable discussion, they answer the question of why after 13 years, haven’t cryptocurrency payments taken off?  Crypto payments aren't 'tap to pay' yet  You can buy streetwear from Off-White, AMC movie tickets and a subscription on Substack using crypto. Even more, Cash App users can make bitcoin payments to any merchant on the Lightning Network. Yet crypto payments adoption remains stagnant.  The technology exists for merchants to enable crypto payments, but that doesn’t mean consumers want the option. On the consumer side, exchange-rate volatility, regulation, safety, privacy and education are all causes for concern. Globally, crypto payments would enable commerce for the approximately 2 billion unbanked adults. For a more developed country like the U.S., however, consumer expectations are higher than the experience that crypto infrastructures provide. Using crypto payments means headaches like paying capital gains tax and giving up chargebacks and other protections. And that is if you can figure out how to buy bitcoin, ether or dogecoin.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Payments Week  Builders can improve adoption by creating incentives for consumers, improving wallet fiat on-ramps and user experience, introducing stablecoins on layer 2 with lower fees and privacy and simplifying education and on-boarding. Crypto payments will move beyond the internet as long as builders make it easier than opening a bank and tap to pay.  –Holyn Kanake, New York-based designer and adviser and CoinDesk columnist  Cryptocurrency is currently too volatile  Two of the biggest payment companies of the last decade, Block (formerly Square) and Stripe, both offered bitcoin payments way back in 2014. Both discontinued those projects shortly thereafter due to a lack of payment volume. Both are trying again with new crypto projects. So what initially blocked crypto from achieving widespread adoption, and does that problem still persist?  In a word: volatility. The wild swings of the most popular coins make for good trading but a poor medium of exchange. Enter stablecoins, assets pegged to a reserve asset that promise to limit volatility and are indeed encouraging. Speed, or lack thereof, is also a factor, but one that will improve with time.  Read More: Why Banks and Payment Processors Shun Perfectly Legal Businesses  Most frustrating, we are still waiting for a consumer-friendly app that opens up payments the way the browser opened up the internet to the masses. While key roadblocks remain, with price stabilization over time, more regulatory clarity and the inevitable emergence of a ""killer"" consumer wallet, we will finally see a mainstream decentralized crypto payment vehicle soon. Just don’t ask me when.  –Ryan Conway, senior vice president at Oxygen  No privacy  Transacting in a pseudonymous environment is akin to skating on extremely thin ice. Large corporations, small businesses and individuals all stand to benefit immensely from on-chain payments, but if ever their wallet addresses are exposed, their entire transaction histories are forever made public. Not to mention, it is a certainty that everyone with whom they transact is instantly availed full transparency into their holdings and exchanges, and thus becomes a source of exposure risk.  –Alex Shipp, chief strategy officer at Offshift  Bad user experience (UX) design  People are simply overwhelmed by the poor user experiences (UX) in crypto. It is easy to forget that beyond technical efficiency, great user experiences ultimately make things feel intuitive, safe, predictable and even delightful. Crypto still lags behind TradFi (traditional finance) in that regard. And assuming you get over that, the complexity of multiple chains and high gas fees simply make payments for the majority of transactions prohibitively expensive.  –Tarik Moon, founder and CEO ofAlpine DeFi  Cycles of cryptocurrency adoption  Crypto payments have not taken off yet because of where we currently are in bitcoin’s adoption cycle. Historically, an asset that becomes money evolves through four stages: collectible, store of value, medium of exchange and unit of account.  Read More: Crypto Payments: When the Tech Fades to the Background  We are still early in the store-of-value phase, when most of the very small number of people who own bitcoin are using it for long-term savings, with the bonus that its value is likely to appreciate significantly over time. As more people adopt bitcoin and store more of their value in the protocol, the price will continue to rise and volatility will decline, making it more suitable for payments.  The desire of more and more people to pay for goods and services with bitcoin will provide the incentive for entrepreneurs and investors to build technology and infrastructure to facilitate bitcoin payments around the world. We are already seeing the earliest signs of this trend today with technology like the Lightning Network, which has experienced rapid growth in the last year.  –Cory Klippsten, founder and CEO of SwanBitcoin.com  Merchants don’t want the risk  There are a variety of Web 3 payment processors that help businesses leverage cryptocurrencies or convert crypto assets to their fiat equivalents more quickly and cheaply than traditional payment networks. However, most merchants aren’t aware that these solutions exist. Those who do often write them off for being too risky, too inaccessible or simply too complicated. Lack of privacy, subpar UX and general user friendliness and high time-to-transaction finality are all factors that have kept crypto payments from taking off. It’s no wonder then that most businesses today are reluctant to accept crypto payments in exchange for their goods or services.  –By Antoni Zolciak, co-founder of Aleph Zero  The problem with “stable”-coins  The problem with crypto payments is stablecoins. The problem with stablecoins lies in their structural design inefficiencies. Whether overcollateralized by other digital assets, fiat-backed by other countries’ native currencies, or algorithmically stabilized, each has distinct weaknesses.  Read More: The History of Cash-Like Digital Payment Instruments  The stablecoin ecosystem has been a hot topic as of late. USDC might soon hit its cap, showing that it can’t alone sustain the growing crypto economy. Algorithmic stablecoins are a response to this scaling shortfall that attempts to achieve scalability through novel price-stabilizing mechanics, a design choice that carries significant risks. Meanwhile, collateral-backed solutions are starving for access to high-quality collateral in order to scale.  In order to fix crypto payments, you have to find a stablecoin with true scaling capability. Finding the right collateral is the key. A politically neutral solution for this is an asset-backed stablecoin, backed by a relatively liquid, stable and highly in-demand asset. We’re betting that home mortgages are the high-quality asset stablecoins need, with $13 trillion sitting in U.S. mortgages alone. Mortgages are one of the oldest and most reliable assets for wealth generation but have been previously only accessible to governments, banks and high-net-worth individuals as an investment vehicle.  –Karl Jacob, co-founder of Baconcoin  More from Payments Week:  PayPal’s Blockchain Chief on the Future of Crypto in Payments  Blockchains offer unique advantages, but these must be combined with a user experience that feels similar to the one consumers know today, writes Senior Vice President Jose Fernandez da Ponte.  Crypto Becomes Lifeline for Russian Emigrés Opposing Putin’s War in Ukraine  Financial censorship has gone from an abstract idea to a harsh reality for Russians who suddenly found themselves unbanked by the West and their own government.

This makes an opportunity for businesses to come up with sustainable, user-friendly models to make widespread adoption easier. Over the last 3 years, the term &apos;cryptocurrency&apos; has lodged itself firmly in the minds of people, regardless of whether they invest in it. The technical aspects of it, however, remain less understood, and for much of the public, this knowledge feels inaccessible. This is understandable, given how crypto is still in its early stages and not widely used. However, that&apos;s all about to change as the race to establish cryptocurrency as the top alternative to traditional banking intensifies, making cryptocurrency a norm.

Trading volumes are low, local lows are updated rather lazily. The local ZEN price rebounds are also lazily organized. However, starting in January 2022, the situation began to resemble preparing the market for a reversal. In the weekly timeframe, we see that buyers were unable to take control of the $32 mark in January-February. https://www.tradingview.com/x/QGM5bfEO/ In history, we see that in the range of this mark there was no significant accumulation of buyers positions. Unsuccessful attempts by sellers to break and fix below the $32 mark indicate local weakness and high chances of growth. The main condition for such a scenario is the successful closing of the weekly candle on 25 April. In the chart, we see that sellers have started a trading week to update the local low. Though, in the $32 range, buyers resisted, creating a pin on the weekly timeframe. Of course, the trading week is not over yet. But, if the situation does not change, the beginning of the ZEN growth phase should be expected next week. This phase symbolically falls on May 2022. However, even a 70% increase in the ZEN price will not mean a global trend change. As long as the ZEN price is in a falling channel, the targets for potential growth waves will be modest.

42423448,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2ZqTh,1650978000,Fireblocks Sees $500M Stampede Into Terra DeFi in First Week,"Cryptocurrency custody specialist Fireblocks said institutional customers stampeded into decentralized finance (DeFi) after it gave them access to Terra, the blockchain ecosystem and issuer of UST, the largest stablecoin behind tether and USDC.  Fireblocks CEO Michael Shaulov said pent-up demand from members of the company’s early access program, including crypto hedge funds, venture capital firms and high net worth individuals, has been “crazy.”  “Once we released the capability to access DeFi on Terra, we’ve seen this kind of crazy demand,” Shaulov said in an interview with CoinDesk. “So over $250 million was deployed in the first 72 hours, and I think it’s exactly a week now and there’s been half a billion dollars of transactions into Terra from our platform.”  The current Terra DeFi access for Fireblocks clients is fully permissionless and is not part of the custody firm’s know-your-customer (KYC) whitelisted DeFi pooling system, recently announced with Aave Arc. That could be in the cards further down the line, Shaulov said.  Founded by South Korea-based Terraform Labs back in 2018, and built on the Cosmos “internet of blockchains,” Terra has grown rapidly from an initial cross-border payments crypto in the form of the LUNA token, to span stablecoins, DeFi, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and gaming. Fireblocks began working with Terra as far back as December 2020.  Terra boasts some 4 million unique wallets and has seen 400% user growth in the past two years, with over $30 billion of total locked value, according to DeFiLama.  The expansion has seen the project look to bolster the algorithmic UST stablecoin (a smart contract keeps the price anchored to $1 by burning LUNA tokens in order to mint new UST tokens) by buying $1.6 billion reserves of bitcoin (BTC), and pledging to purchase a further $10 billion.  Still, grafting bitcoin reserves onto UST’s algorithmic stablecoin apparatus has been flagged up as a cause for concern by some financial experts. Fireblocks’ Shaulov said his custody platform is not involved in Terra’s bitcoin treasury management – which is overseen by the Luna Foundation Guard – but he takes a philosophical view when it comes to risk and innovation.  “Fireblocks’ mission is to provide secure access to well informed investors who have done their due diligence, follow that demand and understand where innovation is heading,” Shaulov said. “You don’t need me to say the model around stablecoins and specifically what Terra is doing is somewhat experimental. If you’re asking me if there is a place for this innovation around stablecoins, I think that the answer to that is yes.”",POSITIVE,BTC | LUNA,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | LUNA | REGULATION,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/26/fireblocks-sees-500m-stampede-into-terra-defi-in-first-week,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fb60676c78e4d3e4ac2382356a203c80df377556-5647x3765.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Coinme said Tuesday it is launching bitcoin (BTC) ATMs across Vermont. The exchange will add 23 kiosks, supported by its partner Coinstar, a change sorting company, to grocery stores across the state, CEO Neil Bergquist told CoinDesk.  “The headline of the Bitcoin whitepaper is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. And literally what we're doing is being a gateway to an electronic cash system. But you gotta be able to turn cash into electronic cash in order to do that,” Bergquist said in a phone interview.  Coinme allows users to buy up to $2,900 bitcoin with cash at around 21,000 Coinstar kiosks across the U.S. It's an alternative to buying and selling their bitcoin online popular among people who pay remittances, according to Bergquist.  The kiosks, however, charge 4% in transaction fees – much higher than buying on the vast majority of online exchanges  Paying with greenbacks comes with downsides. A reporter visited a local Coinme kiosk on Monday night to test out the service; the machine would not accept cash.  According to Bergquist, Coinme’s 100,000 customers generally visit a kiosk nine times a year; they purchase $600 on average. He noted that larger states drive higher sales volumes.  Bergquist noted that 90% of the U.S. population lives within five miles of a Coinme kiosk.  But one state is absent from the list: New York. Its population of 19 million is governed by a crypto licensing regime more stringent than much of the country.  Coinme opened its first Coinstar bitcoin kiosk in May 2014. Now in 49 out of 50 states, Bergquist said that Coinme hopes to expand into New York.

The Henderson, Nevada-based sustainable miner will use the proceeds from the financing for growth capital. “As we mentioned in our Q1 earnings call, debt capital is currently the lowest cost of capital available to the Company,” said Gary Vecchiarelli, chief financial officer of CleanSpark, in a statement. “We intend to continue our efforts of obtaining non-dilutive capital to finance our growth [capital expenditure] needs,” he added.  On CleanSpark’s earnings call in February, the company said that it prefers to raise capital by issuing rig-backed debt and that the company is in active talks with lenders. Other options include monetizing some of the company's bitcoin (BTC) holdings via sales and/or yield.  The financing comes at a time when miners are looking to get creative with their financing as capital markets remain somewhat constrained after bitcoin prices came down from their peak last year. Using specialized bitcoin mining computers, called ASICs, as collateral for loans has become popular among miners to fund their growth plans.  “All the options available for the miners in terms of financing have fundamentally changed over the last year,” Mas Nakachi, head of crypto finance firm XBTO’s mining operations, told CoinDesk in a recent interview. “I think miners are starting to get more comfortable with equipment-based financing,” he added. Among other lending products, XBTO provides financing to miners through asset-backed loans, as well as using bitcoin as collateral.  Most recently, Australian bitcoin miner Iris Energy (IREN) said that it has secured $71 million in equipment financing from institutional bitcoin broker NYDIG with a 25-month term and 11% interest and backed by 19,800 Bitmain S19j Pro miners. Meanwhile, in March, NYDIG also provided about $81.4 million in S19 J Pro-backed loans to miner Greenidge Generation (GREE).  CleanSpark’s loan has a three-year term and carries an annual interest rate of 9.9%. The terms are similar to loan financing done by Trinity Capital last year, where it lent another crypto miner, Hut 8 (HUT), a $30 million equipment-backed loan, with a three-year term and 9.5% interest.  “We are excited to partner with the team at CleanSpark, which is on a mission to mine bitcoin responsibly, using a mix of sustainable energy including nuclear, hydroelectric, solar, and wind,” said Ryan Little, managing director of equipment financing at Trinity Capital, in a statement.

The round was led by Hack VC, Dexterity Capital, Jane Street, Hudson River Trading and other firms, according to a press release.  The exchange offers decentralized finance (DeFi) services via Terra’s stablecoins. Conor McNamee, Vertex’s operations manager, said the protocol’s goal is to expand DeFi lending and other products beyond U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins, which make up 99.5% of all stablecoins.  “A lot of people that are not from America, they want to probably use their local currency, right?” McNamee told CoinDesk in a phone interview. “Especially for firms or trading funds, or neobanks that are offering high interest savings accounts to users on top of DeFi, it's pretty risky not to hedge your [foreign exchange] exposure.”  While the most popular stablecoin in the ecosystem is terraUSD (UST), the chain also hosts stablecoins for Chinese yuan, euro, British pound and more.  Vertex allows users to trade, pool, borrow and lend these foreign cryptocurrencies. They can purchase perpetual swaps to hedge currency risk, making the market more accessible, said the press release.  Vertex is not the first DeFi FX platform. Synthetix, an Ethereum-based protocol that provides synthetic digital asset lending and trading, offers the euro-linked token synth sEUR (SEUR). However, McNamee said Terra’s low fees and transaction speed are more attractive for traders.  Vertex recently completed its Testnet phase with over 75,000 users. McNamee said his biggest insight from the phase was to make the user experience “less intimidating.”  A Testnet user named “Liquidity King” told CoinDesk via Telegram that they hope Vertex can “improve the [user interface], offering better charting options for the currency pairs as well as offering more pairs.”  “We want to bring sophisticated usability and tools to users so, like, trading charts, like limit orders, all this kind of stuff to users,” said McNamee. “We want anyone to be able to trade.”  According to McNamee, Vertex plans to use the funding to build out the team, scale the protocol, and develop a strong backend ahead of its launch in summer 2022. McNamee did not disclose a specific month.

42423453,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2Zqbh,1650970040,Bitcoin's Correlation With Gold-Backed PAXG Token Weakens to Record Low,"The case for adopting bitcoin (BTC) as an inflation hedge, an asset that holds value and preserves the purchasing power of the money invested, is weakening with each passing week.  The cryptocurrency's 90-day correlation with PAX gold (PAXG), a token backed by physical gold and with a value pegged to the price of gold, has slipped to a record low of -0.41, according to data tracked by Coin Metrics. The 60-day correlation between bitcoin and PAXG hit a record low of -0.5 early this month.  The correlation flipped in February just as stagflation talks began doing the rounds and the U.S. Federal Reserve pledged to fight the dreaded high inflation-low growth situation with interest rate hikes. A reading of 1 indicates that the two assets or variables are moving in lockstep, while -1 implies the two are inversely correlated.  ""This reflects BTC's increasing correlation with macro stock indices as well as its recent behavior as a risk asset rather than a store of value, and points to price turbulence ahead as markets digest the impact of further inflation and liquidity withdrawals,"" said Noelle Acheson, head of market insights at CoinDesk sister company Genesis Global.  Bitcoin proponents have long hailed the cryptocurrency as an inflation hedge thanks to its maximum supply cap of 21 million and programmed reduction in the pace of supply expansion every four years. However, bitcoin isn't living up to its reputation as digital gold despite inflation reaching a four-decade high this year. The cryptocurrency has dropped 12% this year, while PAXG and gold have gained over 4%.  Investment demand for gold, a classic store of value asset, and products tied to gold has picked up amid the inflation scare and geopolitical tensions. According to a report by Fund Selector Asia, exchange-traded funds have purchased over 100 tons of gold since March.  PAXG's market capitalization has nearly doubled to $613 million this year, according to CoinGecko. Tether gold (XAUT), the second-largest gold-backed token, has seen its market value rise by 55% to $472 million.  Data tracked by ByteTree shows bitcoin exchange-traded funds and exchange-traded products listed across Europe and in Canada and U.S. have bled over 11,000 BTC this month, pretty much reversing the March inflows.  While bitcoin is falling behind in an inflationary environment, it may be too early to call it a failed inflation hedge. Perhaps bitcoin's utility goes beyond prices, determined mainly by short-term traders.  ""Labeling bitcoin a risk asset and a failed safe haven based on price performance is incorrect – it covers just part of what's going on in the bitcoin market,"" Acheson told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. ""While price is a key indicator of market sentiment, it is largely driven by short-term traders and does not reflect the growing awareness of BTC's value as a seizure-resistant store of value and strong HODLing behavior we see through on-chain data.""",NEGATIVE,BTC | PAXG,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | PAXG,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/04/26/bitcoins-correlation-with-gold-backed-paxg-token-weakens-to-record-low,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/72be438a58f5b1577f640f581232d5df6cb83dec-640x480.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Losses on DOGE futures exceeded $22.65 million in the past 24 hours while losses on APE futures exceeded $11.77 million. The figures were higher than on other days, the data show.  Among the DOGE losses some 68.9% were from shorts, or traders betting against higher prices. Prices surged to as much as $0.17 from Monday’s $0.12 low, and are still 32% higher than Monday.  The price jump in DOGE seemed to arise mainly in the hours before the announcement of Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk's acquisition of social media giant Twitter (TWTR) in a $44 billion deal.  No direct link between the two events exists, but some market observers say Musk could use his influence to include DOGE as a payment method on Twitter. Tesla already accepts the meme coin as a payment option for its merchandise.  APE futures saw $7.9 million in losses from short trades, representing 67% of the total. APE traded at the $17 level in European afternoon hours on Monday, rising to nearly $20 in early Asian hours today. Prices have since dropped back to the $17.88 level.  The rise in APE prices came as the community discussed staking features for the native token of the Bored Ape Yacht Club ecosystem, a collection of 10,000 non-fungible token Apes that has become one of the biggest NFT projects by popularity and market capitalization in the past year.  The proposal weighs the benefits of allowing participants to stake APE and use the Bored Ape Yacht Club ecosystem NFTs to receive APE rewards from a preset pool over a set period of time.  APE rose even as BAYC’s official Instagram handle was exploited late on Monday, resulting in some $3 million in losses, as reported. An unofficial ""mint"" link was sent out by the Instagram account to unsuspecting followers, with the wallets of those who clicked the link being compromised.  The futures losses on APE and DOGE futures contributed to over $200 million in overall liquidations as the broader market rallied by some 3.2% in the past 24 hours.

Afghanis Turning to Stablecoins Over Bitcoin Afghani citizens are worried amid reports of the Taliban raiding properties and seizing people&apos;s assets, which are luring them to embrace cryptocurrencies as a form of savings. According to a recent report from Bloomberg, executives from Maihan, a crypto exchange located in Herat, Afghanistan&apos;s third-largest city noted that demand for crypto is high, and people are no longer storing their wealth in cash or jewelry but preferring crypto instead. However, their focus remains not on Bitcoin (BTC) but rather stablecoins which are digital currencies pegged to fiat currencies. Stablecoins were specifically designed to eliminate the volatility in value that accompanies most crypto assets. By converting their wealth to stablecoins, Afghans are able to mitigate the effects of the devaluation of their country&apos;s currency. In 2021, Afghanistan was ranked 20th among 154 countries in Chainalysis&apos; Crypto Adoption Index.

42423433,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2Zq5h,1650956516,Fidelity Investments Will Offer Bitcoin Inclusion in Its 401(k) Accounts,"U.S.-based financial services firm Fidelity Investments will allow investors to put bitcoin (BTC) into their 401(k) retirement savings accounts later this year, the firm said on Tuesday.  Employers could place a ceiling on the amount of savings earmarked for bitcoin, with the maximum cap expected to be no more than 20%. However, the move would allow several first-time investors to gain exposure to bitcoin without having to make a separate account on a crypto exchange.  A 401(k) account is a company-sponsored retirement plan in the U.S. to which employees can contribute income while employers may match contributions. Employees get a tax break on the money they contribute, while contributions are automatically withdrawn from employee paychecks and invested in the funds of their choosing.  Fidelity’s retirement accounts are big business: They held an estimated $2.4 trillion in 401(k) assets in 2020, or more than a third of the market at the time, as per research firm Cerulli Associates. Fidelity CEO Abby Johnson is scheduled to speak at Consensus 2022 in June.  Fees on the bitcoin investments in Fidelity’s 401(k) accounts would range between 0.75% and 0.90% – depending on the amount and employer – and held on its own custody platform. An additional trading fee would be levied, which remains undisclosed at writing time. Fidelity further plans to create educational materials for investors.  Business analytics firm MicroStrategy (MSTR) is said to have already signed on to the plan. The firm holds billions of dollars in bitcoin and its founder, Michael Saylor, is a staunch backer – often tweeting outlandish takes about the asset.  The move is the latest in the line of bitcoin-centric products and offerings by Fidelity, which was one of the first major firms to warm up to the then-rising asset class in 2018.  The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times earlier reported the news.  In November, Fidelity launched Canada’s first regulated offering that offered bitcoin custody and trading services for institutional investors in the country. It then launched two publicly traded bitcoin funds in December on the Toronto Stock Exchange. This year, Fidelity launched similar products in Switzerland and Germany.  Meanwhile, not everyone is on board with firms offering bitcoin exposure in their 401(k) offerings.  In March 2022, the U.S. Labor Department warned in a directive that cryptocurrencies were speculative and volatile trading investments with inflated valuation. The agency expressed “serious concerns” about providers offering cryptocurrencies in retirement plans.  The agency stressed at the time that providers must offer adequate information to potential investors about the risks involved in cryptocurrency investing, including the volatile prices and the ever-changing regulatory environment.

With blockchain, automobile manufacturers can create and maintain tamper-proof records of important vehicle data such as who owns it, how it&apos;s been maintained, whether there&apos;s been issuance of any recalls, etc. This information can be made available to the car owner, insurance companies, repair shops, and more without needing the manufacturer&apos;s consent or anyone else involved in tracking and monitoring vehicle data. In fact, in some cases, putting this information on blockchain technology would mean eliminating intermediaries and thereby lowering costs for all parties involved. The Current State Of The Automotive Industry The automotive industry has changed dramatically over time, but one thing has been consistent throughout its history: The role of middlemen. A centralized system facilitates a consumer&apos;s transaction with manufacturers and dealerships and creates a barrier between car owners and their vehicles by placing unnecessary restrictions on them. As one of its foundational pillars, blockchain technology seeks to eliminate these third parties that often create barriers for customers.

Bitcoin is completely decentralized, which means it will last longer than fiat, even if it is a victim of the conflict. Additionally, fiat will become worthless during a war, as global hyperinflation would devalue it. And if there is an increase in bitcoin price, people would buy it. That is a lot more money than fiat. The design of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin was to be decentralized, anonymous, and censorship-resistant. These qualities make it ideal as a medium of exchange and store of value in the event of any sort of major disaster or global catastrophe. But how exactly would Bitcoin survive the aftermath of something like World War III? Can We Use Bitcoin During A World War? It&apos;s funny you would ask that because there have been some events in history where governments have forbidden their citizens from using certain forms of currency. But, bitcoin is different because all transactions are recorded on an open ledger called blockchain, making it impossible to censor. And unlike paper currency, no government or entity controls digital currencies like bitcoin. As a result, it can be used almost anywhere globally as long as people accept them as payment. Some countries already recognize bitcoin as legal tender, and other countries appear willing to adopt it in the future. So yes, we believe you can use bitcoins during wartime!

But if it must, then Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, is as good as it gets.  ""Elon is the singular solution I trust,"" Dorsey said of the social media company's impending change in ownership. Earlier Monday, Musk, the Tesla (TSLA) CEO, prevailed in his bid to take the company private for $54.20 a share.  Dorsey, a bitcoin (BTC) maximalist, preceded his statement with an ode to decentralization: ""In principle, I don’t believe anyone should own or run Twitter. It wants to be a public good at a protocol level, not a company. Solving for the problem of it being a company however,"" requires Elon, and Elon alone.  ""Taking it back from Wall Street is the correct first step.""  Dorsey's message follows a day of Twitterverse hand-wringing over the ramifications of a super-rich, bombastic billionaire grabbing control of his favorite megaphone. That debate could have an impact on crypto, too, as Musk has made his fondness for DOGE payments no secret.  For his part, Musk has pledged to prioritize free speech on Twitter, a message of open dialogue that Dorsey praised.  ""Elon’s goal of creating a platform that is 'maximally trusted and broadly inclusive' is the right one. This is also @paraga’s goal, and why I chose him. Thank you both for getting the company out of an impossible situation. This is the right path ...
