42383119,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uAaV,1577394000,Twitter Bug Exposed Millions of User Phone Numbers,"A security researcher was able to use a bug in the Twitter Android app to identify millions of Twitter users, connecting their phone numbers to their Twitter IDs. The exploit could expose failures in the company's two-factor authentication system and give other security developers pause.      According to a TechCrunch report, the researcher, Ibrahim Balic, created randomized lists of phone numbers and sent them to Twitter.      “If you upload your phone number, it fetches user data in return,” he said.      The user data allowed Balic to find phone numbers for many major Twitter ""celebrities"" including the private number of a ""senior Israeli politician.""      “Upon learning of this bug, we suspended the accounts used to inappropriately access people’s personal information. Protecting the privacy and safety of the people who use Twitter is our number one priority and we remain focused on rapidly stopping spam and abuse originating from use of Twitter’s APIs,” a Twitter spokesperson said.      The bug exposed user accounts when Balic uploaded millions of phone numbers and asked Twitter to match them with users. Typically this interface is used only when new users install the app on their phone but, using a set of API calls, Balic was able to spoof this behavior. The resulting breach of privacy - essentially connecting real numbers to real Twitter handles - could reduce the efficacy of two-factor authentication schemes popular on financial applications and wallets.

42383148,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uAUD,1577390014,YouTube Calls Crypto Purge a Mistake but Many Videos Still Missing,"YouTube erroneously purged cryptocurrency education videos from its video-sharing platform this week but claims to have reinstated them, according to a spokesperson. Content creators, however, are telling a different story.      Responding to allegations it had intentionally deleted content from cryptocurrency education channels ChrisDunnTV, Crypto Tips, BTC Sessions and others in what apparently amounted to hundreds of missing videos, the spokesperson said YouTube made “the wrong call.”      “With the massive volume of videos on our site, sometimes we make the wrong call. When it's brought to our attention that a video has been removed mistakenly, we act quickly to reinstate it. We also offer uploaders the ability to appeal removals and we will re-review the content,” the spokesperson said. YouTube has issued near-identical statements after previous inadvertent video purges.      The spokesperson further stated YouTube has not changed any policies related to cryptocurrency videos.      In spite of this, some YouTubers claim their deleted videos remain inaccessible. Chris Dunn, who runs an investment education channel with 200,000 subscribers and a multi-year video library, says the purge has actually gotten worse since he successfully appealed his deletions.      “Today, YouTube not only took down the videos that they reinstated yesterday, but they took down at least one other video that they’d never taken down before,” Dunn said.      At press time a number of videos are still missing from Dunn’s channel and others that CoinDesk directly asked YouTube about, like Crypto Tips. YouTube has not yet responded to follow-up questions.      The conflicting statements are sure to increase the furious speculation over why YouTube deleted the videos in the first place. Multiple theories abound. Dunn said he has no idea why it occurred – not all of his deleted videos had to do with crypto – but said it could be the work of someone “maliciously reporting” him and others or, perhaps, faulty video-flagging AI.      Dunn said YouTube flagged videos as “harmful or dangerous content” and the “sale of regulated goods.” Dunn told CoinDesk he does not sell products on his channel and does not monetize his videos with ads.      Regardless of the whether the purge was intentional or not, Dunn said he and other content creators have noticed YouTube target content it deems objectionable to itself or its advertisers.      He pointed to YouTube’s demonetization of violent political videos, like footage of the Hong Kong protests, and its recent terms of service update, which features a throwaway account termination clause with potentially far-reaching ramifications.      “YouTube may terminate your access, or your Google account’s access to all or part of the Service if YouTube believes, in its sole discretion, that provision of the Service to you is no longer commercially viable,” the Dec. 10 ToS update reads.      Dunn said he interprets that to mean YouTube can terminate creators who do not make it money.      He told CoinDesk he is seriously considering walking away from YouTube altogether. Contacted for additional comment Thursday, Dunn said he had a goodbye video ready to go and was only waiting for the situation to clear up.      Dunn’s plan, if he invokes that nuclear option is to move his content to “decentralized [video] platforms” where no single entity exerts commercial control.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/12/26/youtube-calls-crypto-purge-a-mistake-but-many-videos-still-missing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f5c62432c6940dd2c580372c5d2a9a24ceda2aff-1500x1001.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42383112,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uAVT,1577386800,Holiday Spending Jumps as E-Commerce Beats Brick-and-Mortar,"E-commerce sales hit record highs this year as Americans continue to move their holiday shopping online.      According to Mastercard’s SpendingPulse report, online retail grew 18.8 percent over last year’s holiday season. That’s enough to make online sales a record 14.6 percent of holiday shoppers' total spending, the report says.      Online consumers this year spent 17 percent more on apparel, 8.8 percent more on jewelry, 10.7 percent more on electronics and 6.9 percent more at department stores.      Overall, holiday spending jumped 3.4 percent compared to 2018.      The strong numbers came in spite of 2019’s unusually short holiday season, commonly defined as the period between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Shoppers had six fewer days than they had in 2018 because Thanksgiving came later in the month this year.      Steve Sadove, an advisor for Mastercard, said in a press release that retailers adapted to the shortened season.      “Due to a later than usual Thanksgiving holiday, we saw retailers offering omnichannel sales earlier in the season, meeting consumers’ demand for the best deals across all channels and devices,"" he said.      Retailers that accepted crypto or managed crypto payments were slow to respond when CoinDesk asked how their holiday shopping season had gone. eGifter, a gift card trading service, noted that it had not yet ""crunched the numbers"" on holiday sales but that the company ""saw growth in overall crypto sales,"" said Bill Egan, the site's VP of Marketing.      ""We saw more gifting with crypto in 2019, compared to buy-for-self use cases in prior years,"" he said.      Payment processor BitPay found the holidays quite inspiring as well.

42383102,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uAHd,1577385000,Crypto Custodians Grapple With Germany's New Rules,"Crypto firms are getting ready to exist under a new regime in Germany.      Under a law going into effect Jan. 1 requiring digital asset custodians to be licensed, each company that currently custodies crypto and targets German clients must announce to Germany’s Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) its intention to get a license before April 1 and submit an application by Nov. 30.      A clause allows current crypto custodians to keep serving German customers without being penalized if they declare their intent to apply, but those same companies are waiting on BaFin to release final regulations around the law.      “As long as the legislation is not in place, BaFin is not going to think about how to cope or how to deal with the legislation,” said BaFin press officer Norbert Pieper. The regulator declined further comment and Germany’s Federal Ministry of Finance did not respond to request for comment by press time.      Pieper added: “There is no date foreseeable [yet] by which we’ll be able to communicate the results of our assessment. We will certainly communicate that on our website.”      While the final regulations haven’t been set yet, the new license requirement may not produce the same kind of exodus of crypto firms that New York saw after the BitLicense requirement, said Miha Grčar, head of business development at Bitstamp.      London-based Bitstamp, one of Europe’s largest crypto exchanges, plans to continue operating in Germany but declined to say whether it would apply for a license, said Grčar. Crypto firms could also use a white-labeled custody service to operate in Germany.      Because the law is an “updated version of the existing banking regulation,” banks will likely have the most to gain from it, Grčar added. Companies that get the license will be German financial institutions, but not classified as banks.      The law also means that German regulators now see crypto as a “legitimate” industry, he said.      Ulli Spankowski, chief digital officer and managing director of the crypto custody subsidiary of German stock exchange Boerse Stuttgart, called Blocknox, sees the license as a step forward for “the professionalism of the industry.” The subsidiary has already advised BaFin that it plans to apply.      “There are other countries that won’t go for a full-fledged license,” he said. “If you want to get traditional, established players from the banking side, you need to give them this environment to feel safe.”      DLC group is taking advantage of the new regulatory framework by offering consulting services for firms interested in applying, and its own white-labeled crypto custody service.      Sven Hildebrandt, head of Distributed Ledger Consulting Group, is concerned some exchanges won’t understand the nuances of the new law.      “The law is only in German and no English translation of the law is out there,” he said. “What’s going to happen to exchanges? [Operating without a licence] is actually a felony and not a misdemeanor so that’s jail time.”      Hildebrandt predicts the costs of licensing will be similar to other German financial services licenses where firms will need two managing directors, an established German entity and 125,000 euros of starting capital. He also estimates installation will cost 250,000 to 350,000 euros and recurring yearly costs will be 350,000 euros.      Switzerland-based Crypto Storage AG, a subsidiary of Crypto Finance AG, is opening a branch in Germany to offer crypto custody to banks and then financial technology startups.      “Large banking houses will do custody business in the future,” Stijn Vander Straeten, CEO of Crypto Storage AG, said. “They are moving slowly, though. We’ll build it up now for a premium.”      Berlin-based solarisBank this month opened a subsidiary called solaris Digital Assets to offer crypto custody as a service. So far, the bank has a handful of customers testing the service with more than 40 companies in the pipeline, said Alexis Hamel, managing director of solaris Digital Assets.

42383076,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9u8C3,1577383818,The Bahamas Launches Digital Currency Pilot,"The Bahamas’ digital currency pilot project went live in Exuma on Friday.      Residents of the island can now enroll in the Central Bank of The Bahamas’ “Project Sand Dollar,” which began Dec. 27. They will receive mobile wallets the Bahamian government sees as facilitating the future of payments on the island chain. Central bankers announced the debut on Tuesday.      Bankers said “Sand Dollar” is a “digital fiat currency” – not a cryptocurrency, stablecoin or competitor to the Bahamian dollar. Instead, it is simply a digital version “equivalent in every respect to the paper currency,” they said in the project outline.      But it is also a step toward the Bahamas’ long-term goal of launching a fully-fledged central bank digital currency (CBDC). Also called the sand dollar, that larger project would link domestic residents and businesses across a seamless digital payment infrastructure.      In this vision, residents can pay retailers through wallet-linked QR codes, with banks moving funds in digital form. The Central Bank believes this could ultimately cut currency printing costs and transaction fees while enhancing financial inclusion.      “A widely adopted CBDC would place users at less risk of violent crimes that target holders of cash, and potentially reduce security and insurance costs associated with keeping cash on business premises,” according to the outline.      For now, however, the sand dollar faces far more restrictive limits from the government. Businesses cannot hold more than B$1 million in their digital wallets, nor can they transact more than one-eighth of their annual business through the wallets in any given month. And individuals max out at B$500, with higher limits coming through “enhanced due diligence” on their accounts.      The Central Bank “will vary these limits over time as may be necessary,” according to the outline.      The Bahamas’ retail-focused digital currency comes as more governments ready CBDC schemes of their own.      Sweden’s Riksbank is building its long-awaited “e-krona” in partnership with consultancy Accenture while China appears to be on the verge of launching a CBDC next year.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | FIAT,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2019/12/26/the-bahamas-launches-digital-currency-pilot,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a335acf8dd6f2a908d0e55de72ed44c4e0007bdc-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383075,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9u8EZ,1577379600,Crypto Firms Can Now Apply for a License in France,"France’s top financial regulator has published new rules regarding the licensing of digital asset service providers (DASPs) as well as guidelines for firms applying for the non-mandatory license and informing the regulator about internal cybersecurity practices.      The Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) or Financial Markets Authority released the rules on Wednesday and the guidelines on Thursday last week, opening up the opportunity for firms to apply. The rules and guidelines expand upon France’s PACTE law, one of the first crypto legislative packages passed in Europe. PACTE passed in May 2019.      To apply, each DASP has to send the AMF a two-year business plan, a list of digital assets the firm is going to service, the list of geographies the firm will operate in and the firm’s organizational chart among other things.      Licensed DASPs are required to have professional indemnity insurance or a minimum amount of reserve funds, at least one effective senior manager, resilient IT systems, an internal control system, a claims handling procedure, an organization enabling it to avoid conflicts of interests and procedures to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing.      The license is optional for crypto firms operating in France, however. The French government only mandates that crypto custodians and any firm dealing with fiat-to-crypto or crypto-to-fiat services register with the AMF for anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing reasons.      The French regulator also released specific rules for crypto custodians, crypto exchanges, crypto broker-dealers, and crypto custodians.      “To the best of my knowledge it’s the first time we’ve seen precisely how a custodian has to maintain the key to assets on blockchain, and what is the role and liability of the custodian,” said Hubert de Vauplane, a partner at law firm Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel.      The French government, with the help of the AMF, has defined crypto-asset custody service as “mastering” the “means of access” (cryptographic keys) for a third party’s digital assets and keeping track of their positions, said Emilien Bernard-Alzias, a partner at law firm Simmons & Simmons in Paris. New rules for licensed custodians under its general regulations include multi-validation for customers' transactions and compensating clients if the custodian cannot restore control of those assets.      In its guidelines, the AMF notes the security risks that blockchain poses and asks crypto firms to provide the regulator with a detailed cybersecurity program that mitigates risks and complies with Europe’s general data protection regulation. Crypto firms are responsible for the cybersecurity of the digital asset service they provide and must undergo regular technical audits.      “The AMF is trying to take crypto firms by the hand to help them comply,” Bernard-Alzias said. “For other financial service providers there are requirements for a strong IT system, but the AMF guidance does not have many details for them as they do for crypto firms ... For this, the AMF is having crypto firms explain at the beginning what they are going to do, and this is new for us in France.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2019/12/26/crypto-firms-can-now-apply-for-a-license-in-france,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5b46a8a245204b3252d80f44d850b771fbe6f18f-1000x666.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383087,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9u8M7,1577373792,Binance Blockade of Wasabi Wallet Could Point to a Crypto Crack-Up,"2020 may see crypto’s most consequential fork yet: A split between regulated exchanges and privacy-focused users.      Late last week, Binance's Singapore arm threw crypto Twitter into a frenzy with reports that it had allegedly suspended one user’s account. The problem? That user, @bittlecat, had tried sending their bitcoin to the hash-scrambling Wasabi wallet in an apparent violation of Binance SG’s anti-money-laundering (AML) policies.      Binance SG refused to transact “directly or indirectly” with a variety of often illicit-tied crypto services, “especially darknet/mixer sites,” according to @bittlecat’s tweets of their email exchange with Binance SG support.      @bittlecat’s suspension was temporary. But if Binance SG’s anti-mixing policy holds – especially if it spreads to other exchanges – developers and observers say it could cut the crypto ecosystem in two.      “I think the exchanges are slowly coming to a crossroads,” said Gergely Hajdu, a developer with Wasabi wallet.      Users of privacy-enhanced wallets may find it ever-harder to move coins to and from regulated exchanges.      “Some exchanges may be completely foreclosed,” Hajdu said. “It will be so bad that I can't express.”      On one side of this chasm: the crypto service providers embracing oversight from their local regulators and global watchdogs like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). And on the other side: privacy-conscious users, some of whom turn to shadowy-but-not-necessarily-illegal coin mixing services to shield what they hold.      “The big picture is more regulation is coming, and it's gonna make this look, pretty normal in a couple of years,” said Tom Maxon, Head of U.S. operations for blockchain security company CoolBitX.    A regulatory sprint    Observers see this as one battle in the larger war to determine crypto’s direction.      There are the space’s early ideals, its proponents preaching as they did a decade ago, that bitcoin will bring privacy and financial autonomy to millions – irrespective of borders. Bitcoin, it was said, could be the decentralized answer to a world in seemingly constant consolidation mode.      Bitcoin could be traded peer-to-peer. Bought on exchanges. Shuffled between wallets (essentially digital bank accounts) that carried no personal identifiers. Mixed on services like Wasabi Wallet to make tracing it hard.      But that vision never sat well with governments. Nor with their regulators, wary of a financial instrument they could not control.      “Regulators are not comfortable with gray,” Maxon said.      And as millions – then billions – of dollars began flowing into bitcoin and other crypto assets, chief players around the globe began pushing for some way to regulate it.      The laws came slowly at first. Now, however, intergovernmental organizations like the FATF have set the world up for a regulatory sprint. FATF’s June guidance on a “risk-based approach for virtual assets and virtual asset service providers” gave financial regulators the world over a unified understanding upon which police the space.      FATF’s guidance hardly bans “virtual assets.” Nor does its global framework rule out “mixing services."" But it highlights their money-laundering risks, teeing up regional rule-makers for a crackdown on “obfuscatory” technologies that governments like Singapore's have hinted at.      Maxon’s firm is developing a tool to help exchanges deal with the FATF’s travel rule, an outcome of the June guidance that pushes “virtual asset service providers” to share reams of customer data – much like the requirements traditional banks face. He sees the potential split as almost inevitable.      “The regulators are going to move this forward more swiftly than we've seen before,” Maxon said. “And then the ramifications, like these other services like mixers are going to be harder to use. It's that kind of stuff that's going to peter out over the coming years.”    Mixing in the gray zone    Mixing obscures the path one's cryptocurrency takes; in the case of Hajdu’s Wasabi wallet, a Chaumian CoinJoin mixer scrambles multiple parties’ unspent transaction outputs (UTXO) into a nearly untraceable cryptographic mess. Put simply: multiple parties send their coins to multiple receivers in one transaction, making it hard to suss out who sent what to whom.      The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has not thrown out mixing entirely. Its webpage on the FATF guidelines does, though, say that virtual asset service providers should take careful note of “factors that could obfuscate transactions.”      But Binance’s global public relations head Leah Li said in an email statement that its Singapore exchange was following regulators’ lead.      “Binance SG operates under the requirements as set forth by MAS and our MAS regulated partner, Xfers. Hence there are AML CFT controls set in place for the Binance SG and the user triggered one of its risk control mechanisms,” Li said.      Casey Bohn, a law enforcement educator with America’s National White Collar Crime Center, said MAS’ hint-hint-nudge-nudge is more than enough for companies like Binance.      “From a corporate perspective, it’s a lot easier for me as a regulated money business to have a policy saying, ‘Hey man, we're not going to allow this [activity] even though it's perfectly legal because we don’t want heat from the regulators,” said Bohn.      Bohn said he believes the public has an inherent right to financial privacy. And though his cryptocurrency investigations often rely on the bitcoin blockchain, he nonetheless supports an individual’s desire to live off the map.      By the same token, he is skeptical that exchanges should be calling the shots over what’s permissible, and what’s not. He points out that right now an exchange has no way of knowing who controls a destined account once its user withdraws.      “Let's say the exchange takes action against me based only on their assumption that the next wallet is still under my possession. Do we really want the technology corporations to be the arbiter?” he said.    Real-time tracing    Binance contracts with third-party service providers like Chainalysis to help it trace crypto transactions. These crypto-sleuths develop hefty tools to track asset movements; Chainalysis’ “Know-Your-Transaction” (KYT) software does so in real time.      Wasabi transactions have a “pretty unique” identifier that makes it “very easy to identify them in numerous ways,” according to Wasabi developer Bálint Harmat. But he insisted that his mixer, and others, are not inherently illegal. He also noted that Wasabi has reached out to Binance and Chainalysis to clarify the situation and prevent future issues.      A spokesperson for Chainalysis echoed that sentiment in an email statement.      ""While mixers themselves are not illegal, we know that stolen funds from hacks and scams are often laundered through mixers. We recommend that our cryptocurrency exchange customers configure Chainalysis KYT to flag large transfers or high-velocity small transfers from mixers for further investigation because it could prevent criminals from cashing out stolen funds.”      Regulatory gears are already moving in radically anti-anonymity directions. Maxon, the CoolBitX executive, said FATF’s travel rule will have the most visible and immediate repercussions. Exchanges, he said, will develop user-filled forms built into their interface.      “Who are you sending this crypto transaction to? What is their name? What is their account number on that exchange?” he said, illustrating how those forms will appear.      “I think even people who are not that privacy-minded will think: “Oh crypto is not decentralized anymore,"" Maxon said. ""It never really was on the centralized exchanges, but it kind of breaks the spell.”",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2019/12/26/binance-blockade-of-wasabi-wallet-could-point-to-a-crypto-crack-up,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b05815c2e60feae1772988484dbd0fb0d7b867c8-1200x803.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383077,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9u8An,1577368800,The View From Tel Aviv: Ouriel Ohayon,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Ouriel Ohayon is CEO of KZen Networks, maker of the keyless ZenGo crypto wallet.      This year Tel Aviv played host to its first Blockchain Week, a sign the crypto industry is starting to recognize Israel's capital as a center of innovation in the field.      Talking to Ouriel Ohayon, a longtime local entrepreneur, you get a deeper sense of what’s happening. Tel Aviv’s crypto market is in transition. Many of the first-wave crypto startups founded there are slowly suffocating. Yet, the city is growing into a hub for research on which future companies will be built.      It’s a story that's practically baked into its landscape: Its ancient streets now support a whirlwind of rapid expansion and modernization.      A transplant from France, Ohayon has lived between Paris and Tel Aviv for the past 15 years, with stops in Silicon Valley. Ohayon has been in the startup and venture capital scene his entire adult life, and had a side gig writing for TechCrunch. His company, KZen Networks, builds consumer wallets using secure multi-party computation (MPC), a cryptographic technique developed in the 80s.      Thanks for taking the call. What were the major developments of the past year, in your opinion?      The two biggest highlights of the year are curious because they have nothing to do with bitcoin or ethereum, the major blockchains. The most important was the announcement of Libra because of what it has triggered: transnational debates about how money is managed, what should the role of government be in cryptocurrency, and how major policies are working or could be improved. Initially, I perceived it as an accelerator for the crypto industry, which has not been the case, but it has been an accelerator of the debate around money and how money should be improved.      The second biggest event is related: the push by the Chinese government to declare digital currency as a national priority on the level of artificial intelligence and 5G. Anything else that has happened is probably minor compared to those. It’s more of the same: some funding, ups and downs. Also of note, the Securities and Exchange Commission has gone after, or been vocal about, projects they think were harmful to investors. There’s been a systematic demonstration of force by the SEC, which has not happened in such a consistent way until now. It’s important because we still lack regulatory clarity, though there is clear enforcement of the rules. It sets the tone. But also harmed a lot of projects, like kik.      Can you give a sense of the crypto scene in Tel Aviv?      There has not been a lot of positive advancements in Israel this year. What seemed to be a very promising hotspot for the crypto industry has slowed down. Most of the most visible projects at the forefront of the news, either because of the amount of money they received or their ambition, have not delivered. Famously, the Sirin Lab’s blockchain phone raised a lot of money, but has not delivered. Kik, kin has shut down in Tel Aviv, where a lot of engineering took place. That affected maybe 100 employees. Though at the research level – pure research, not into projects and services – Israel is making progress in fields related to crypto, like zero-knowledge proofs, security and custody and multi-party computation. Almost half the partners in the MPC [multi-party computation] Alliance, which recently formed, are from Israel.      Israel a had a lot of start-ups working on projects to run on Libra. For instance, ZenGo coded a non-Calibra wallet. Is this experimentation still going on?      Honestly, everything has gone completely quiet lately. Initially, everyone got excited by the opportunity presented by Libra, but now they understand it will take more time to roll out than expected. We’re still committing to Libra at ZenGo, but I haven’t much about other projects that declared to work on Libra. It was a good opportunity. Facebook has a huge operation in Tel Aviv, right around the block from my office. There have hundreds of employees, I’m not sure of the exact number, working on Libra doing customer service, automation, custody. Lots of things will be built and designed in Tel Aviv.      It seems to be contradictory that the start-up scene is cratering but research is popping. How will this play out in 2020?      This is not just about Israel. Given a long enough timeline in tech, there will be gaps between research and development. There are three steps: research translates to development that translates to actual products and services. One follows the other, always with a time delay between. You need fundamentals to be there before you get the code foundation and the services to be deployed.      In crypto, there is so much research at the core level to improve how bitcoin works and how security works and improve the protocol transaction speed. All of that gets built into open-source code, which then gets picked up by commercial projects. The industry has been stagnating and decreasing in delivery, but research is being pushed to the limits. It can only lead to better things coming up. So 2020, I expect to be the year of product delivery.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | RESEARCH,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/26/the-view-from-tel-aviv-ouriel-ohayon,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d30315a39c88791b2978ef21ad2c9f1e3a59dfd-1200x675.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383081,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9u8Fp,1577361600,The Ethereum Community Is No Longer Fighting With Itself,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Bob Summerwill is executive director of the Ethereum Classic Cooperative, a volunteer for the Ethereum Project and Community Ambassador for CryptoChicks.      2016 and 2017 were divisive years for the ethereum ecosystem. It would have been easy for onlookers to think, “Look at all of this in-fighting and drama. The next web? The next revolution? I do not think so. Ethereum is going nowhere!”      They would have been dead wrong in that assessment, as 2019 has demonstrated.      In January 2016, the former CTO of the ethereum project, Gavin Wood, spun off the former ETHDEV C++ team to found Ethcore – later renamed as Parity Technologies. There has been an ongoing love-hate relationship between Parity and the rest of the ethereum community ever since. This continues to the present day with its controversial proposal to move the Parity-Ethereum project into a DAO.      In July 2016, we had world-class drama when The DAO was drained of funds. After a month of the most intense debate, the ecosystem was cleaved into two with The DAO Fork. The “World Computer” majority accepted the fork that returned funds. That fork retained the ETH “ticker” and the ethereum trademark while the “Code is Law” crew showed the world that minority chains can survive by supporting the un-forked chain and bringing Ethereum Classic to life.      In October 2016, Parity Technologies blocked relicensing of cpp-ethereum to Apache 2.0 at the eleventh hour because it would have affected their commercial interests. They also feared that having IBM’s “nose under the tent” could have led to a chain split. That relicensing looked very likely to result in a huge swing towards ethereum within the Hyperledger consortium, which had been formed a little under a year before. Not to be.      Blocking the relicensing led indirectly to the creation of the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance (EEA), which emerged as a “Plan B” as the relicensing floundered. No grand alliance between Ethereum and Hyperledger was possible at that stage, but there were sufficient enterprises using ethereum for more formal collaboration to be worthwhile.      So, February 2017 saw the founding of the EEA, including household names like Microsoft, Intel, JPMorgan, BNY Mellon and CME Group. The members were focused primarily on private and consortium chain scenarios. The birth of the EEA was a very tense affair, with serious worries the Ethereum Foundation (EF) would flat-out denounce the EEA. Vitalik Buterin was privately supportive but did not attend the launch event in person. Instead, he sent in a pre-recorded video that made no mention of the EEA but spoke in generalities about business uses of ethereum. The EF itself made no formal statement. The tension was palpable in those early months.      Was the EEA an attempt at corporate capture of ethereum? Was the EEA just a front for ConsenSys (which was contributing most of the resources during that launch period and early stages of operation)? Parity was also notably absent, and indeed has never joined the EEA. Were the EEA and Hyperledger rivals? Was this just a proxy battle between Microsoft (a major backer of ethereum) and IBM (the prime mover within Hyperledger?)    The artificial boundary we have put in place in our minds between 'public chains' and 'private chains' is fading rapidly.    None of these fears were true. They were all the result of zero-sum thinking.      As Jeremy Miller said at the EEA Launch event, there was no reason why a suitably modular ethereum codebase should not meet all of these use-cases – public and private, permissioned or permissionless. An analogy could be drawn with the internet and intranets. Both have their uses. Deployment choices would just be configuration settings on common codebases.      That is just how things have played out.      That process started in February 2017 when Monax (a founding EEA member) contributed the first Ethereum Virtual Machine – Burrow (previously known as ErisDB) to Hyperledger - the first concrete step towards ethereum technology within Hyperledger. Burrow was integrated into Hyperledger Sawtooth (as Seth), and then into Hyperledger Fabric. EVM-in-Fabric was the primary display at the IBM booth at Consensus in May 2018.      In January 2018, I wrote a tweetstorm that became the “Call for an End to Tribalism in Ethereum” keynote at the Ethereum Community Conference in Paris in March 2018. Kent Barton continued that theme with “Divided We Fail: The Irrational Insanity of Crypto Tribalism” in April 2018.      That Paris conference also saw the launch of the Ethereum Magicians led by my former colleagues Jamie Pitts and Greg Colvin. That group of individuals sought to mature the governance around the ethereum protocol improvement process.      In October 2018, EEA and Hyperledger announced they were becoming associate members of each other's organizations and would be collaborating on common projects. In April 2019 the Token Taxonomy Initiative was launched, with Microsoft and IBM working together. In June 2019, Microsoft finally joined Hyperledger. Now we just need IBM to join the EEA (hint, hint)!      Tensions between the Ethereum Foundation and the EEA thawed in 2019, with Aya Miyaguchi, the executive director of the EF, joining the Board of the EEA in August 2019, and the Mainnet Initiative being announced as a collaboration between the EF and the EEA.      In August 2019, ConsenSys announced it would be joining Hyperledger as a premier member, with founder Joe Lubin joining the governing board. ConsenSys announced it would be contributing its Enterprise Ethereum client Pantheon (now renamed as Besu).      Three years after the failure of cpp-ethereum relicensing, we finally had a fully-fledged ETH mainnet client as part of Hyperledger. Besu was written in a mainstream enterprise language – Java, had permissive Apache 2.0 licensing and had mature governance under the Linux Foundation. It was built by a large team of world class software engineers, building to the specifications which the EEA had matured since 2017.      ETC Cooperative funded ETC support and that work was completed by ChainSafe in December 2019. There has been a period of growing collaboration between the ETC ecosystem and the ETH ecosystem in late 2018 and throughout 2019, after several years or hurt feelings and bitterness after “a bad divorce."" Virgil Griffith was key to that detente and has been an excellent friend to ETC.      As my friend John Wolpert said so well in his seminal “Bring on the Stateful Internet” blog post in August 2018:      “I wish we could take all the good work out there – the patterns each team in the blockchain space has explored for the past several years – and lop off all the brands, the flags, the preciousness we all get when looking at our own babies. We would see it all as a bag full of Legos, a set of potential standards converging on what we really need in order to build awesome new applications that transcend the limitations and troubling central control issues of client/server.”      The artificial boundary we have put in place in our minds between “public chains” and “private chains” is fading rapidly. All our different technologies, whether we call them blockchains, or DLTs, or distributed databases, should be interoperable.      One chain to rule them all is maximalist nonsense. Our future evidently has multiple chains. L1s and L2s. State channels, rollups, Plasma, Lightning, counterfactual instantiation, L2 privacy solutions, off chain compute, every type of consensus under the sun. Integration with legacy systems is critically important too. Blockchain is not a silver bullet.      At the close of 2019, we are in a completely different place than we were during the high drama of 2016. Former rivals (both within ethereum and across the broader enterprise blockchain ecosystem) are pulling together in a way that is a delightful contrast to the fractured landscape of the near past. Collaboration is proving the winning strategy over cut-throat competition. This trend will only accelerate into 2020.      Maturity of governance is also finally being seen as the critical foundation for collaboration which it truly is. The whole ecosystem is finally growing up.      In 2016 I wrote:      “We have the opportunity to build a set of technologies in the next few years which could have similar societal impacts as the Internet, the World Wide Web and open source languages, relational databases, etc. We are building a decentralized computing platform which every individual on Earth should benefit from.”      “These technologies need to reach into every nook and cranny of our computing fabric: big and small, public and private, independent and corporate; smartwatches to mainframes.”      “This is a large and ambitious undertaking that is addictive and all-consuming for many of us. Diversity of viewpoints, a broad spectrum of use-cases to mature the base technology, and an open and inclusive attitude and environment of collaboration will help us achieve our shared goals.”      In 2020, that dream is closer to becoming a reality.
