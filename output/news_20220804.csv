This had sparked fears of another bearish trend starting in the market. However, this has quickly changed as the numbers for last week have come in. This time around, the bitcoin funding rates are painting a better picture for the digital asset. Funding Rates Return To Neutral The bitcoin funding rates for the last week have been more optimistic compared to previous weeks. This is because it had continued to maintain its positive at neutral for the whole seven days; there was not a single point in the week that funding rates had actually fallen below neutral.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Neither bitcoin nor ether got much of a boost from the news of a move deeper into cryptocurrencies by the giant traditional money manager BlackRock (BLK). But Coinbase (COIN) shares sure got a boost, rocketing higher in what looked like a short squeeze.  Insights: Vulnerabilities of cross-chain bridges have emerged as one of the leading security risks, as attackers garnered nearly $2 billion in illicit gains across 13 separate hacks already this year, Shaurya Malwa reports.  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $22,523 −3.4%      ●Ether (ETH): $1,594 −3.2%      ●S&P 500 daily close: 4,151.94 −0.1%      ●Gold: $1,808 per troy ounce +2.8%      ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.68% −0.07       Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Bitcoin Continues to Drop, Coinbase Stock Surges  By Helene Braun  Bitcoin (BTC) dropped for the seventh consecutive day, losing as much as 1.6% Thursday as it crossed the $22,500 mark. Ether (ETH) was down 1.5%.  The slide came even as positive news emerged from Coinbase earlier Thursday regarding a new partnership with BlackRock to allow more institutional investors to allocate money to cryptocurrencies.  Some prominent Twitterati suggested that the announcement should have had a more significant market effect; Barry Silbert of Digital Currency Group (which owns CoinDesk) wrote that he was “surprised BTC price didn’t move on this news. It is a game changer.”  The price movement might be more of a reflection of hawkish remarks made by Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester earlier in the day. She said that the U.S. Federal Reserve will continue to raise interest rates, most likely to a rate of over 4%.  She also said the Fed could pause hiking rates in the second half of 2023, refuting the idea that global central banks could potentially start cutting rates early next year, which some investors already appear to be counting on.  The price of bitcoin went up last week when Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference was received by investors as rather dovish.  Coinbase short squeeze  The big winner in crypto stocks Thursday was Coinbase, whose shares surged as much as 31% to $106 after the U.S.-based exchange announced the partnership with BlackRock.  The shares quickly fell back closer to the $90 mark in afternoon trading, ending the day up 11%.  ""A classic technical short squeeze,"" analysts for the firm S3 Partners, which tracks data on stock borrowing, wrote in a report.  The rest of the crypto market seemed unaffected by the news, with the average return-on-investment (ROI) being negative at -2.16%.  Among cryptocurrencies, FLOW, the token of the Flow blockchain created by Dapper Labs, was a big winner, up more than 37% over the past 24 hours after the social media giant Meta Platforms (META) announced its platform Instagram will be adding support for non-fungible tokens (NFT) built on the Flow blockchain.  Markets in general seem to have recovered from U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-Calif.) visit to Taiwan on Tuesday, which caused many investors to stay away from risky assets amid potential U.S.-China tensions.  Ether (ETH) ended the day slightly lower, trading at $1,644.62 at press time.

Attackers garnered nearly $2 billion in illicit gains across 13 separate hacks already this year.  Such attacks account for 69% of total funds stolen in 2022, the security firm Chainalysis estimated in a report this week. The nettlesome trend has exposed the lax security measures put in place by developers to protect users of their crypto projects.  Bridges are a top target for North Korean-linked hackers, who have stolen some $1 billion worth of various cryptocurrencies this year entirely from bridges and other decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, according to Chainalysis.  Bridges are protocols that enable an exchange of information, cryptocurrency or assets such as non-fungible tokens to move from one blockchain network to another. The cryptocurrencies used to run bridges are stored in on-chain wallets, which makes them susceptible to attacks.  A North Korean hacker group was previously said to be behind the $600 million attack on Axie Infinity’s Ronin bridge. Another case linked to the country’s hackers was the $100 million exploit of Harmony’s Horizon bridge.  “Cross-chain bridges have been targeted by nation-state threat actors in the past with meticulous planning and precise execution,” Andrew Morfill, chief information security officer at crypto custodian Komainu, told CoinDesk. “Early indications with Nomad [another bridge] were that it was driven by opportunistic ’looters.’ But while the drivers are different, the outcomes, inevitably, are the same – loss of assets.”  'Disruptive technologies are volatile'  Why are such hefty attacks commonplace? Security experts say crypto remains a learn-as-you-go playground, meaning products are built fast and without adequate testing.  “Disruptive technologies are volatile and, with that, bring significant risk and great rewards,” said Daniel Keller, co-founder of cross-chain ecosystem Flux. “Most of the developers in the blockchain space are learning on the fly, as they come from conventional technology stacks and are retrofitting their skills.”  Education on crypto development will “become a driving force” and eventually lead to better programmed services, according to Keller.  “As adoption grows, you will see a robust push from leadership driven by the institutional demands for their client base,” he said. “As the industry matures, we will continue to see hacks. “  Chainalysis said in its report, “Just a few years ago, centralized exchanges were by far the most frequent targets of hacks in the industry.”  “Today, successful hacks of centralized exchanges are rare. That’s because these organizations prioritized their security, and because hackers are always looking for the newest and most vulnerable services to attack,” the firm stated.  Improved security practices for deploying smart contracts would eventually “serve as templates for developers to build from,” Chainalysis wrote.  The hefty price tag of costly lapses might provide an extra incentive to get on with it.  CoinDesk TV  In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV.

42421249,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXhsR3,1659651043,Michael Saylor Lost Big in the Dot-Com Bubble and Bitcoin's Crash. Now He Aims to Rebound Again,"Michael Saylor is down about a billion dollars on his bitcoin (BTC) bet and just stepped down as CEO at MicroStrategy (MSTR), the software company he founded in the 1980s.  Being in a tight spot is familiar territory for the 57-year-old Saylor. After the dot-com bubble burst in March 2000, Jim Cramer, the CNBC host, pointed to the collapse of MicroStrategy as a catalyst. The stock had tumbled 62% in a single day after MicroStrategy announced accounting mistakes, erasing $6 billion from Saylor’s wealth and marking a prominent end to the high-flying days of the early Internet. Later that year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission brought, and then settled, accounting charges against MicroStrategy, Saylor and other company executives.  Saylor and MicroStrategy then spent two decades mostly under Wall Street’s radar. Not that he was suffering. MicroStrategy kept plugging away, developing software for businesses. Saylor lived in a Miami Beach, Florida, mansion that looks like a Spanish colonial palace. A recent visit by a CoinDesk reporter revealed painted cherubs on the foyer ceiling, gold paneling and crimson-red wall paper in the dining room, a stage beyond the office library stocked with guitars, drums and whatever else a band might need, and a portrait of Saylor styled like an old English sailor – with laser eyes. A yacht was floating out back, where a crew lived full-time so Saylor could travel whenever he wanted.  What brought Saylor back to center stage was bitcoin. His fear of inflation drove him in 2020 to start investing MicroStrategy’s cash in the original cryptocurrency. The company’s cash flows started getting routed to bitcoin. He lined Wall Street bankers’ pockets by selling debt to raise money to buy bitcoin. In the process, he audaciously turned his sleepy software company into a bitcoin vault. In all, MicroStrategy has spent about $4 billion on digital assets. MicroStrategy’s stock became a proxy for holding bitcoin. The stock price moves up and down in lockstep with bitcoin’s movements.  He became something like a bitcoin preacher spouting religiously fervent praise. His grandiose predictions included one that bitcoin will eventually be worth $100 trillion, roughly what all stocks in the world are collectively worth now.  “After scientifically studying everything on Earth, I’ve concluded bitcoin is the best inflation hedge,” he told CoinDesk during a November interview at the Miami Beach mansion. “We buy bitcoin as fast as we can with whatever money we find lying around.” His advice as bitcoin was near its record high? “If you have bitcoin, don’t sell it. If you don’t have bitcoin, buy it. And if your bitcoin is moving around, wait.”  Fast forward to today. MicroStrategy’s stock has lost about two-thirds of its value since peaking last year, dragged down by the current bitcoin bear market. This week, Saylor handed the CEO title to Phong Le, who had been MicroStrategy’s president, and shifted into an executive chairman role, pledging to put all his focus on bitcoin investing. Le now runs the legacy software business.  Saylor wasn't immediately available for an interview for this story.  So who is Michael Saylor?  Born in Lincoln, Nebraska, into a military family, Saylor grew up around bases. That included Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio. He attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on an Air Force scholarship and became an Air Force second lieutenant.  He launched MicroStrategy in his early 20s after convincing his employer, DuPont (DD), to give him $100,000 and free office space and computer equipment, Saylor told Charlie Rose during an interview in February 2000. Saylor’s quirkiness was visible back then, offering a glimpse of what was to come with bitcoin.  “I think you're going to see over the next decade that people are going to use software to route traffic on every major highway,” he told Rose 22 years ago. “We're going to use it to determine what hospital we go to or what drug we take. We're going to use it to arbitrage out all the spreads in the interest rates in the finance market and get us a better deal from our bank and probably a better trade in the stock market.”  But he immediately noted the serious potential downsides of technology, too, about a month before his stock plunged. “If the software crashes, the civilization comes to a grinding halt in the same way that if you shut down air traffic control at a major airport, traffic will come to a grinding halt,” Saylor told Rose, adding, “And that’s what’s exciting about technology.”  Darin Feinstein, co-founder of the Bitcoin Mining Council, knows Saylor because the MicroStrategy executive helped form the advocacy group in May 2021.  “He is a genius entrepreneur,” Feinstein said in an interview after Saylor's job change. “You say something and he already knows what you're going to say,” Feinstein said, when asked how Saylor is during meetings. “He operates on a completely different level.”  After he stepped down as MicroStrategy CEO, some observers initially speculated the bitcoin buying was over. They quickly learned that’s not the case. Saylor intends to go even deeper now that he’s executive chairman.  “In my next job, I intend to focus more on bitcoin,” Saylor tweeted early Wednesday.

Ethereum has been the victim of hacks, forks and now a controversial update, the &apos;merge&apos;, which could shake things up in the Ethereum ecosystem and even lead to the creation of yet another form of Ethereum.In this article, I talk about Ethereum&apos;s past to understand its future better.A Brief History of EthereumEthereum was founded in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin with the help of other household crypto names such as Gavin Wood and Charles Hoskinson. Ethereum was built from the start with the idea of allowing anyone to create decentralized applications. The project began to develop under a swiss company, Ethereum Switzerland GmbH, but would later become a non-profit organization known as the Ethereum Foundation.On 30 July 2015, the Ethereum platform was officially launched, and the genesis block was mined. Since then, Ethereum has undergone numerous protocol upgrades and changes to its structure, with one of the most significant being the hard fork that took place in 2014, which led to the creation of Ethereum Classic.In 2...",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETC | MARKET | FORKS,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4529915-ethereum-wars-miners-stakers-forks-merges?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/913855.jpeg
42395078,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWuzZ,1659649557,Here's Why Portuguese Banks Are Closing Crypto Exchange Accounts,"Portuguese commercial banks are shutting down the accounts of crypto exchanges because they want to avoid the potential for criminal activity through those exchanges.  And even though the exchanges are licensed to operate in Portugal, the banks can basically do what they want when it comes to shutting those accounts.  Last week, Portugal’s largest bank, Banco Comercial Português, and Banco Santander (SAN) closed Portuguese crypto exchange CriptoLoja’s accounts. The exchange is no longer allowed to hold any capital within those banks.  This exchange is not alone. Earlier this year, crypto exchanges Mind the Coin and Luso Digital Assets also had their accounts closed by Portuguese banks.  Portuguese banks have been closing crypto exchanges’ accounts over the past year, citing concerns about crypto exchanges facilitating money laundering and other criminal activities.  “From the corporate side it’s a nightmare. A simple payment is not as easy as if we had a bank account here in Portugal,” said Pedro Borges, the CEO of CriptoLoja. “This kind of nuisance, these kinds of measures that the banks are taking are not good for the country.”  Luso Chief Product Officer Ricardo Felipe told CoinDesk that last year national bank Caixa Geral de Depósitos gave him no reason why the exchange is no longer allowed to hold accounts with the bank. Banco Comercial Português and Banco Santander said they closed accounts this year because of suspected fraudulent clients. Borges did not respond to questions about these specific allegations.  “We already knew that this was just a matter of time and we would need to pay attention and focus our efforts on our banking relationships,” said Felipe.  Felipe said the regulatory landscape in Portugal allows for banks to legally terminate accounts with cryptocurrency exchanges without any input from the regulator.  “Even though we do have an [anti-money laundering] regulation or license from them, it's not something that establishes that kind of operation with the banks,” said Felipe.  Nuno Correia, chief strategy officer and founder of Portuguese cryptocurrency exchange Utrust, told CoinDesk the company hasn’t been impacted by banks closing its accounts. However, he sees the discrepancies between the regulators and the banking sector.  “The Central Bank of Portugal has a deep expertise, does deep due diligence in businesses and at the same time embraces innovation. [It is] not the same case for the banking sector itself,” Correia said.  Portuguese regulatory framework  Portuguese banks are regulated by Banco de Portugal, the nation’s central bank. According to local lawyer João G. Gil Figueira, the central bank grants licenses to various cryptocurrency companies operating in the country. However, commercially independent banks are at their own discretion to allow these companies to hold accounts in their banks and can terminate them whenever they choose.  Figueira told CoinDesk that banks prefer to work with companies that may not raise concerns over money laundering or tax evasion, two crimes seen as commonly associated with digital asset lenders and brokers.  “It seems that banks do not trust their own regulator’s judgment on issuing such authorizations to operate. So it’s a mixture of banks being slow-moving, unprepared, afraid of money laundering, and preferring other low-hanging fruits in other sectors,” Figueira told CoinDesk.  Although Luso cannot hold an account with the Banco de Portugal, Felipe said he’s optimistic that European Union's upcoming Markets in Crypto Assets bill that will go into effect in 2024 will provide regulatory clarity on the relationship between commercial banks and regulators.  The Markets in Crypto Assets law (MiCA) will provide a regulatory framework for digital asset regulation, from stablecoins to initial coin offerings, across the European Union. It will also create a common licensing regime, allowing companies to easily set up in each of the EU’s member nations.  “With MiCA, we will turn into financial institutions. We will have that safeguard of being given partner bank accounts in Portugal, even if the bank wants to conceal them,” said Felipe.  However, Figueira isn’t under the impression that MiCA will do anything to prevent banks from closing accounts in Portugal. Rather, it will work as a “passport” for crypto companies to operate between European nations.  “MiCA will not have an impact in the [anti-money laundering/know your customer rules] regard, as much as it will have an impact on consumer protection, so more so on the creation, issuance and investment in such assets. It will not so much have a direct impact on the banking aspects and issues that we are discussing,” said Figueira.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/08/04/heres-why-portuguese-banks-are-closing-crypto-exchange-accounts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/57275151fb572c599d4b944c4f1aa6beff082202-1885x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It’s an additional headache for Circle as it aims to go public later this year. The company, which got into VC investing in late 2021, is best known for issuing a stablecoin called USD Coin (USDC). The entire stablecoin space finds itself under greater regulatory scrutiny following this year’s collapse of Terra’s terraUSD (UST).  Circle, which invests in early-stage blockchain projects and companies, participated in the $8 million Series A for Slope Finance in February and the $22.4 million seed round for Nomad in April.  “We are monitoring the current situation,” a Circle spokesperson responded when CoinDesk asked for a comment regarding the Nomad exploit. The statement was repeated when Circle was asked about Slope Finance.  Circle’s ties to Nomad and Slope didn’t cause any financial damage to the company, according to the spokesperson. The investments, however, showed how the interconnections of a growing industry can cast a shadow.  Circle’s USDC, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, is the second-largest stablecoin, with a $54 billion market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap data. It trails only Tether’s $66 billion USDT.  Read more: What Is a Stablecoin?  After UST – another stablecoin that used a riskier method of maintaining its peg to the dollar – imploded this year, there were rumblings in Washington that more stablecoin regulation could be on the way.  Unlike UST, which was supposed to keep its one-to-one relationship with the dollar via an algorithm tied to another coin, LUNA (issued by Terra), Circle’s USDC pool of assets looks much more plain vanilla.  In a bid to increase transparency, Circle last month released an unaudited reserve report showing that USDC is backed by $42.1 billion in short-term U.S government bonds and $13.6 billion in cash, funds that could be used to stabilize the coin’s peg and ease industry-wide liquidation fears.

Total revenue for the quarter was $4.4 billion, compared with the $4.3 billion that analysts were expecting on average according to FactSet. Revenue fell 6.6% from the second quarter a year ago, driven by a decrease in bitcoin revenue, the company said.  Excluding bitcoin, net revenue was $2.62 billion. Adjusted earnings per share were 18 cents, compared with analysts' average estimate of 16 cents.  Cash App, a peer-to-peer payments service that allows users to directly buy and sell bitcoin, generated $1.79 billion in bitcoin transactions and $41 million of gross profit in the quarter, down 34% and 24% year over year, respectively.  The company said the decrease was the result of “a decline in consumer demand and the price of bitcoin, related in part to broader uncertainty around crypto assets, which more than offset the benefit of volatility in the price of bitcoin during the quarter.”  Electric car maker Tesla sold roughly 75% of its bitcoin holdings in the second quarter, but Square held on to its bitcoin. As a result, it took a $36 million impairment against the value of its bitcoin holdings. As of June 30, the fair value of its investment in bitcoin was $160 million, versus the carrying value of the investment of $113 million.  Shares of Block fell 6.5% to $83.83 in after-hours trading on Thursday. The stock is down almost 45% year to date.

Ether (ETH) declined 3% to below $1,600. BTC and ETH appear to be in a short-term downward trend, as they both have shown seven consecutive negative candles.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  BTC's price grinds lower, while volatility declines as well  Bitcoin's price registered a seventh consecutive negative candle on the daily price chart, and both volume and volatility are have been declining. With each of the most recent declines, the daily volume fell short of its 20-period moving average.  As mentioned previously in Market Wrap, volume often serves as a proxy for the level of conviction behind the direction of an asset's price. When volume is persistently below its moving average, that can signal that both bullish and bearish investors are reluctant to add to their positions.  BTC’s price has fallen below its 50-day moving average, while the RSI (relative strength index), has declined to 49.8, signaling that bitcoin's price momentum is now neutral.  Volatility has been in decline for both bitcoin and ether, as the ""average true range"" (ATR) for BTC and ETH has declined 46% and 25% respectively. ATR is a market volatility indicator that measures the difference between the high price, closing price and low price of an asset over time.  An expansion of an asset’s ATR indicates increased volatility, and the contraction of ATR implies reduced volatility. While both BTC and ETH have registered successive declines in price, those declines have been muted in the aggregate as a result of lower volatility.  The average true range for BTC has been declining since June 19, demonstrating a contraction in volatility for the largest cryptocurrency by market cap.  Initial jobless claims increase  On the macroeconomic front, the Labor Department reported that initial jobless claims for the week ended July 30 increased by 6,000 to 260,000, surpassing estimates of 259,000. Initial jobless claims from the prior week were revised down to 254,000 from the original estimate of 256,000.  Continuing jobless claims increased to 1.4 million, compared with analysts’ forecast of 1.37 million, while the prior week’s figure for continuing jobless claims was revised up slightly to 1.37 million, from 1.36 million. Such economic news weighs heavily on risky assets like cryptocurrencies and stocks.  Some on-chain analytics metrics imply that BTC is undervalued.  A number of on-chain indicators are signaling that BTC is undervalued. Specifically, the “market capitalization to realized capitalization,"" or MVRV, metric implies that BTC prices are near a bottom.  MVRV isn't a timing mechanism as much as it is a valuation metric, and so investors are prone to use it to determine where prices are rather than what action they should take as a result.  Historically, values that exceed 3.7 have coincided with market tops, where values less than 1.0 have coincided with market bottoms. The current MVRV score for BTC is 1.05 indicating that bitcoin prices are still near undervalued levels.

The first cryptocurrency by market cap seems to have lost momentum as uncertainty spills into the crypto market from legacy markets. Related Reading: The Pelosi Effect? Ethereum Faces Headwinds Over Area At $1,600 At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $22,600 with a 4% loss in the last 24 hours and a 1.2% loss over the past seven days. The cryptocurrency has lost its 200 days simple moving average (SMA) at $22,800. In the short term, recapturing this level is crucial to maintain the bullish momentum. Bulls need to sustain BTC&apos;s price current levels and push beyond its 200 SMA to prevent the cryptocurrency from re-testing previous support levels. Analyst Caleb Franzen presented the chart below to show how BTC&apos;s price was rejected at a critical level. The cryptocurrency managed to hit the top of the channel shown above and now seems poised to re-test the lower level at $21,200. This level should operate as support in order to stop a downside trend below $20,000.

In addition, ANDE President Félix Sosa told a local a radio station he will ask Abdo to partially veto the legislature’s recently passed bill regulating crypto mining and trading. At issue, according to Sosa, is a cap on the rate that can be charged to miners at just 15% above the industrial rate.

In the Alto Paraná area, according to Sosa, illegal connections by mining companies led to losses of $410,000 in July alone, bringing losses to $2.2 million for the first seven months of the year.

Voyager Digital got the other offers after Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX offered last month to purchase the company with cash and offer early liquidity on customers’ bankruptcy claims. These customers would also be able to create new accounts on FTX.  Voyager rejected FTX’s offer last week, calling it a “low-ball bid dressed up as a white knight rescue"" that only benefits FTX.  FTX’s offer to purchase Voyager is actually the lowest received thus far, Voyager attorney Joshua Sussberg said in court, according to Bloomberg. He did not disclose details of those other bids.  Sussberg also said the rival offers would allow customers to recover much more than 30 cents on the dollar.  Alameda had previously given Voyager a loan through a $200 million cash/USDC-backed credit facility and 15,000 BTC.  In a second day hearing presentation, Voyager said that so far 88 potentially interested parties have been contacted during its restructuring process, 46 parties signed non-disclosure agreements and 22 parties are active in its sales process. The final bid deadline is on Aug. 26 and sale hearing will be held on Sept. 7.  Voyager also said in the presentation that its advisors are engaged in ""active discussions"" with over 20 potentially interested parties and the lender plans to emerge from bankruptcy in the first quarter of next year.

42411759,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfgvi,1659642300,Crypto Risk Management: How to Get Your Wealth Off an Exchange,"Keeping your cryptocurrencies in exchanges comes with risks, and there are dangers in doing so for a long period of time. Crashes, hacks and exploits have resulted in losses of hundreds of millions of dollars in the short history of cryptocurrency. The stunning collapse of FTX goes to show how quickly fortunes can change even with the biggest names in crypto, and recent scrutiny of Binance has people worried anew about keeping their crypto in centralized exchanges.  If your intention is to buy and sell digital assets quickly, it’s convenient to leave them in an exchange. It is much safer, however, to store your digital assets in what’s known as cold storage, and it’s important to also know how to cash out into fiat, like the U.S. dollar, from whatever exchange or exchanges you’ve invested in.  Risks of crypto exchanges  While many people begin their crypto investment journey by opening an account on an exchange like Coinbase or Binance, they are not without risks. Here are some common ones:  An exchange suddenly halts selling and withdrawals, hence indefinitely barring you from access to your crypto.  An exchange becomes insolvent, as happened with FTX and its FTT token.  The exchange undergoes an outage, cutting your access to its platform and your cryptocurrencies.  The exchange itself turns out to be a scheme, as was the case with QuadrigaCX and some other early exchanges.  A crypto exchange gets hacked, causing the exchange to liquidate its assets, thereby making users unable to access their crypto, as was the case with Cryptopia.  Why cold storage is the safest option for your crypto  There’s a famous saying in crypto, “not your keys, not your coins,” which basically means if you are entrusting another entity, such as an exchange, to hold the private keys to your crypto, it is the one who controls your crypto, not you.  To keep things simple, you want to have custody or control over your crypto and to not give that power to an exchange or other third party. To do so, you need a crypto wallet that gives you custody. There are two main kinds of these wallets, hot wallets and cold wallets.  A hot wallet gives you custody, but because it's connected to the internet, it's vulnerable to hacks such as the recent one on Solana wallets and past exploits such as KuCoin’s hot wallets being drained of $280 million.  A cold wallet is the safest way to protect your wealth regarding cryptocurrencies because it keeps your tokens offline. A cold storage wallet has no connection to the internet, which dramatically decreases the ability of hackers and cybercriminals to access your assets, keeping them safe and secure.  Some of the most popular cold storage devices are hardware-based, such as the Ledger Nano S and Trezor Model One. Additionally, a cold storage device offers better risk management and control than exchanges. When you hold crypto in a cold wallet, it completely belongs to you, giving you freedom to sell and trade when you want, how you want and with whom you want. Letting a crypto exchange store your digital assets falls under their surveillance and conditions.  Read more: How to Store Your Bitcoin  How to withdraw crypto into a cold storage wallet  The steps for withdrawing your cryptocurrencies are similar among all exchanges:  Log into your account in your crypto exchange.  Find the cryptocurrency that you would like to withdraw and press “withdraw” or “send.”  Input your cold storage address into the respective field. Your wallet address can either come in the form of a QR code or an alphanumeric string similar to the one below.  Press the option to “review” the transaction once you are ready.  Review the withdrawal details, such as the amount you receive with the fees deducted, if applicable. Make sure everything is correct here – if you send it to an incorrect wallet address, you cannot get it back.  If you have SMS OTP or a verification authenticator enabled, input the code.  Once you confirm everything is correct, press “confirm withdrawal.""  For more detail on the process and how to set up a cold storage device, here’s our review of the Ledger Nano S Plus, which includes a step-by-step example of how it works with that device.  Why you might want to cash out your crypto into fiat  Cashing out into fiat, such U.S. dollars, is another option if you feel the investment risks of all cryptocurrencies or a specific cryptocurrency have risen above your comfort level. Exiting your positions and converting them into government-issued money will remove your wealth from any risk of hacks and the volatile nature of the crypto market.  There are times when the crypto markets are choppy and volatile, and 2022 has been a year of corrections and crashes in crypto. Whether you are unsure of the markets or are bearing large financial risk, cashing out even 50 percent of your portfolio can relieve you from the stress of what is still a highly speculative and volatile market and give stability to your financial planning.  There are times in recent history when cashing out into fiat would have saved your wealth – for example, the start of the Covid-19 pandemic or when China banned crypto transactions, both of which resulted in a crypto crash.  Cashing out your cryptocurrencies in the early stages of a crypto crash or correction can also help you sleep at night.  How to cash out  Being prepared for a turn of events in the crypto market is critical. Converting your crypto into fiat to withdraw from your bank account is a simple process:  1. If necessary, convert your cryptocurrency to a more popular one such as BTC or USDT, as not every crypto on an exchange can always be directly cashed out for fiat.  2. Select the cryptocurrency you would like to convert to fiat. This option is usually in a dropdown menu where you choose, for example, U.S. dollars or euros.  3. Upon confirming your selection, choose where/how you would like to receive the fiat you exchanged. With many exchanges, you can receive payment through debit credit cards or ACH (U.S.-supported wire transfer).  4. Finally, check whether your funds are delivered into the account you chose.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | WALLET | BNB,Mike Antolin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/crypto-risk-management-how-to-get-your-wealth-off-an-exchange,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/407ac17ab1a5106e2b95804f09eb57222bcb90ad-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411415,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNe7f,1659639818,"How to Get Into Seed Club, the ‘Y Combinator of Web3'","Applications are open to join the next round of Web3’s version of Y Combinator.  Seed Club, like the popular tech startup accelerator, runs a multi-week mentorship program to help fledgling organizations and communities find their footing. The difference is Seed Club “invests” only in projects built around cryptographic tokens and, well, those aren’t really “investments” at all.  “We really want it to be starting in our own primordial ooze rather than indexing on what was happening in the startup space,” Seed Club co-founder Jess Sloss told CoinDesk, downplaying the YC comparison. But they’re also not “reinventing the wheel,” he said.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Seed Club is both a bootcamp and a “network” of successful and upstart founders and companies organized as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). The mission is to foster the quickly growing crypto-native creator economy.  If that sounds vague, it’s only because of the near-infinite number of organizations, striking out on a near-infinite variety of industries, that can be built around crypto today. This is a platform for platforms, a network of networks and a DAO made of DAOs.  I spoke with Sloss to find out what makes an ideal candidate and learn more about what is quickly becoming one of the quickest ways to gain legitimacy in the Wild West of Web3. The DAO offers a 12-week crash course for building a token project, including legal training, fundraising and development advice.  Teams apply to Seed Club, and if they’re selected, promise to contribute 3% of their project’s tokens to the DAO. Once launched, those projects will receive a grant of tokens from Seed Club’s treasury, giving them membership in, and part-governance over, Seed Club’s DAO.  “We can be a lot wider in our earlier stage work [to support] people that are building something novel that maybe the world doesn't quite understand what to do with yet but that we think there's something interesting to explore,” Sloss said.  See also: DAOs Are the Real Meritocracies | Opinion  In that way, Seed Club is an ever-expanding fount of knowledge – as people discover how and where to actually apply tokens to businesses and communities. It has incubated 65 projects so far, including the Russian art collective Pussy Riot’s DAO and ex-Bloomberg reporter Matt Leising’s publication, DeCential Media.  “Since we're not investing capital into these things, it's less about finding the tradition 100x or 1,000x on an investment,” Sloss said. “We're looking for projects that are pushing some interesting edge that hopefully have a viable model for sustaining itself.”  This is all the more important considering the wider pullback in funding and the hiring freezes across tech, amid a period of economic uncertainty. In fact, YC recently sent its portfolio companies a letter, titled “Economic Downturn,” to advise founders to “plan for the worst.”  Growing DAO  Sloss said the two-year-old DAO started off as “11 people in a Telegram chat,” and it basically had to beg to get its first eight applicants. It’s now preparing for its fifth cohort, with applications open until Aug. 15. The last cycle saw 300 pitches, with 20 making the cut.  “If we get 1,000 applicants and there are only 10 projects that we think fit the bill, we would work with only 10,” Sloss said. He said that about 250 people have applied for SC05 (Seed Club accelerator 5).  Over time, Seed Club has also refined and expanded its mission. Originally geared more toward social tokens, a way for people to monetize their personal brands, the group is now open to a wider set of technological applications.  “More tools are in the toolbox now,” Joon Ian Wong, another Seed Club co-founder, told CoinDesk. That includes non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. The shifting focus may also speak to the regulatory risks that these particular tokens carry, as well as the collapsed enthusiasm after the major social token launchpad Roll was hacked.  Successful applicants  For this batch, Sloss said it’s experimenting with the application process. It has rolled out a new “decision making tool” (found at seedclub.xyz), whereby club members get to vet and comment on pitches to help applicants “put their best foot forward.”  Once they filter through that longlist, they’ll apply a standardized grading rubric and begin interviewing each team and do wider due diligence.  “We're not about volume. We really want to make sure that we are putting our weight behind really great people and great products and … removing as much bias as possible,” Sloss said.  In terms of what they’re looking for, Sloss said the core to any successful project is the “human beings behind it.” Seed Club is looking for people with real experience either building products or leading communities. The “legacy [rubric of] founder market fit is still very important to us.”  See also: Not Everyone Can Afford to Be Satoshi | Opinion  They’re also looking for a “call to adventure,” or people willing to strike out in entirely novel directions – rather than copy-pasting existing code or building widgets. Perhaps most important is a founder's ability to “communicate” a vision, considering how unclear Web3 can be.  There is sometimes a conflict between humanity and technology in Web3. So much of crypto is directed toward removing humans from decision-making and automating processes. Bitcoin wants to stop the Federal Reserve from pulling levers on the economy, while smart contracts aim to efficiently and consistently execute some function.  For its part, Sloss said Seed Club is made of and for people. “The valuable work that we do with early-stage projects can only be done by human beings,” he said. While there are places – like tracking and rewarding development progress – that can be “formalized,” it’s a “mistake to jump right to smart contracts and software.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | ZRX,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/08/04/how-to-get-into-seed-club-the-y-combinator-of-web3,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/74255fca6180d851d0b46b03354e98895ebc1f04-1816x1362.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411112,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giC9N9,1659639615,Master of Anons: How a Crypto Developer Faked a DeFi Ecosystem,"Something about Sunny Aggregator felt off-kilter to the cryptocurrency user known as Saint Eclectic.  Sunny was the newest decentralized finance (DeFi) app to hit Solana during that blockchain’s scorching bull run last summer, when its native token jumped fivefold. Sunny was barely two weeks old by early September, but billions of dollars in crypto were flooding this yield farm.  Still, Saint and others had questions: Who was behind Sunny? Why was its developer, one “Surya Khosla,” pseudonymous? Was its codebase audited? Would users’ cash be safe?  “There was no indication of who Surya was,” Saint recalled recently, “so many users didn’t feel comfortable” putting their crypto in.  Their suspicions proved prescient.  CoinDesk has learned who Surya was: Ian Macalinao, the chief architect of Saber, a stablecoin exchange built on top of Solana. In turn, he built Sunny Aggregator on top of Saber.  And that’s just the top of the pile.  Coding as 11 purportedly independent developers, Ian, a 20-something computer wiz from Texas, created a vast web of interlocking DeFi protocols that projected billions of dollars of double-counted value onto the Saber ecosystem. That temporarily inflated the total value locked (TVL) on Solana, as the network was racing toward its zenith last November. The DeFi faithful regard TVL as a barometer for on-chain activity.  “I devised a scheme to maximize Solana’s TVL: I would build protocols that stack on top of each other, such that a dollar could be counted several times,” Ian wrote in a never-published blog post reviewed by CoinDesk. The blog post was prepared on March 26, three days after Cashio, one of Ian’s secretly built protocols, lost $52 million in a hack.  Two close to the matter confirmed the draft’s authenticity.  Peak value  Ian’s ploy worked for a while. By his count, Saber and Sunny comprised $7.5 billion of Solana’s $10.5 billion TVL at their peak. (Billions of those dollars were double-counted between his two protocols.)  “I believe it contributed to the dramatic rise of SOL,” Ian wrote of a time when Solana’s native currency traded at $188.  Solana network’s TVL continued to swell even after the Saber ecosystem began losing steam in mid-September 2021, topping at $15 billion around Nov. 9, according to data provider DeFiLlama, while Saber’s TVL had by then dropped 64%.  Ian wrote he disdained this “vanity metric”; nonetheless, “it bothered me that Ethereum TVL was so much higher” than Solana’s, because in his view, DeFi projects on Ethereum – the largest blockchain for DeFi – are “stacked” to double-count deposits.  “I wanted to create a system very similar to this,” he wrote. One problem: “If the same team built each protocol, TVL would be more silly as a metric. Thus I created more anonymous profiles,” he wrote.  Ian wore 11 masks.  In public, Ian and his brother Dylan called their anonymous personas “friends,” or “friends of friends.” Their “Ship Capital” coder club was laying the “blueprints for my ideal DeFi ecosystem,” Ian wrote in the unpublished blog. Saber and its so-called liquidity provider (LP) tokens anchored everything.  “If an ecosystem is all built by a few people, it does not look as authentic,” Ian wrote in his blog post. “I wanted to make it look like a lot of people were building on our protocol, rather than ship 20+ disjoint[ed] programs as one person.”  The Macalinaos wanted other crypto protocols to become so dependent on Saber that “its failure would lead to the entire system going down,” as Dylan phrased it on Oct. 1, 2021. “Btw this is the 200 IQ [Saber Labs] strategy, but few understand…”  The Macalinao brothers offered no comment by press time.  A ‘Sybil attack’  There are valid reasons to seek shelter in pseudonyms. Ian’s weaponized “anons,” however, mounted something akin to a “Sybil attack” abusing crypto users’ trust. (A Sybil attack is when a computer in a network uses bogus identities to gain disproportionate influence over the whole.)  Read more: Why CoinDesk Respects Pseudonymity: A Stand Against Doxxing  “I am revealing this because it is inevitable that I will be found out,” Ian wrote in his never-published blog.  Instead, the Macalinaos in May published “Saber Public Goods” to propagate the “Saber team’s” prolific code across Solana. Eight of Ian’s 11 secret projects appear there. Their disclosure is mum on the anons and their master. Sunny and Cashio, whose tokens imploded, don’t show up, either.  ‘My army of anons’  Surya Khosla was Ian’s moniker when building Sunny Aggregator. Surya popped onto Twitter in August 2021. Saint Eclectic, the Sunny skeptic, hesitated to deposit his LP tokens in the work of this mysterious character, an anon with an artificial intelligence-generated face.  One factor swung in Surya’s favor: The Ian puppet claimed to know brother Dylan “pretty well in real life.” On Sept. 9 of last year, Dylan Macalinao tweeted he “felt comfortable” putting his own crypto into Sunny Aggregator. “We audited their code,” Dylan, who is in his early 20s, said.  Dylan lent Surya the credibility he needed to win over skeptics like Saint.  The problem was, the lead developer, “Surya Khosla,” didn’t exist. Dylan’s brother Ian built Sunny Aggregator. Ian had made Surya up.  It was Ian’s first dalliance with assumed identities for Saber – and far from his last.  Ian wrote in March 2022 that he had created 11 ”anonymous founders that are actually me.”  Ship Capital had many “friends"": 0xGhostchain, who created Cashio; Goki Rajesh, builder of multi-signature wallet Goki; Larry Jarry from mining rewards aggregator Quarry; Swaglioni, the “grandmaster” of governance platform TribecaDAO; and of course Surya Khosla from Sunny Aggregator, Saber’s yield farm.  These DeFi Lego bricks were the jewels of the Saber ecosystem. Lesser-known protocols Crate (run by kiwipepper), aSOL (0xAurelion), Arrow (oliver_code) Traction.Market (0xIsaacNewton), Sencha (jjmatcha) and Venko App (ayyakovenko), rounded out the crown, according to Ian’s blog. He admitted to creating the lot.  Pump it  Ian, Dylan and the puppet anons promoted Ship Capital’s work incessantly on social media.  They shilled their counterparts’ launches and integrations, praised their brethren's thinkfluencer tweets, credited each other for inspiring them to build on Solana. They even circulated Ian’s self-referential memes.  Sometimes they waxed philosophical. When on Dec. 29 prolific Solana developer Armani Ferrante (a real person) tweeted, “If you're not making mistakes you're too slow,” five Ian stooges responded in four minutes:  “As @simplyianm likes to say… it's an experiment!” declared @_kiwipepper – “herself” one of them.  Others danced around the truth. “Team size =! Success,” Ian tweeted on Dec. 7, 2021. “I would pay @larrinator01 and @0xGoki 10x market rate in a heartbeat. Not that they need my money…” (Ian’s Goki and Larry personas cheered).  Ian’s anons were cheeky when outsiders challenged their legitimacy.  “I’m no puppet,” Surya Khosla asserted on Nov. 25. In early January he joked of “doxxing myself” to another developer as a reward for building atop Sunny; Ian’s creation even tweeted a photo that purported to show himself visiting the Macalinao brothers in Los Angeles.  It's impossible to know whether Ian puppeteered his anons’ Twitters after springing them from his workbench. But two people who have worked with Ship Capital recalled the inexplicable behavior of its crew. One persona’s Telegram account would come online after another logged off.  Regardless, Ian admits in the unpublished draft to pulling their strings where it mattered most: the codebases.  “If you are a developer, it is very easy to find out which open source protocols were written by me: there is always a ‘flake.nix’ file that only I use.”  CoinDesk verified that many of the projects described in Ian’s blog contained the “flake.nix” file.  #CashioRulesEverythingAroundMe  To understand how the “army of anons” pumped double-counted value into Saber, 0xGhostchain’s Cashio project offers a compelling view.  Unveiled last November near the crypto market peak, Cashio’s CASH was billed as a “decentralized stablecoin” whose dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies were backed by “liquidity provider” tokens. (LP tokens are a type of crypto asset that holders “stake” to earn extra yield. DeFi protocols issue them to users whose loaned tokens keep trades moving smoothly.)  Cashio accepted only LP tokens from Saber as collateral. That wasn’t overly strange last November, when Saber, an “automated market maker” with over $1 billion in TVL, was a major DeFi trading venue for stablecoin pairs on Solana. (Saber’s current TVL is $90.6 million.)  Cashio relied on Saber ecosystem projects created by Ian’s anons to generate yield.  It first packaged Saber LP tokens into “tokenized baskets” using Crate, which Ian built under the pseudonym “kiwipepper.” It sent those “crates” through a yield redirection platform called Arrow – Ian built this as “oliver_code.” Finally, Cashio said it earned yield by staking these deposit derivatives in “Surya’s” Sunny Aggregator as well as Quarry, which Ian built as “Larry Jarry.” Profits flowed to Cashio’s treasury, managed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).  Confused? Cashio’s customers were. CoinDesk asked two high-profile users of Cashio to explain the app’s convoluted process; neither could. The app’s “about” page didn’t help much, either.  What users cared about was this: Cashio’s DeFi machine accepted their Saber LP tokens and spat out CASH tokens.  It was a lucrative trade. CASH holders could deposit their LP-backed stablecoins into Sunny liquidity pools and earn returns of 10%-30%. Had they deposited Saber LP tokens into Sunny instead of Cashio, they would get just 5%-10%, one trader said. It didn’t matter that the same crypto asset was behind both.  Such is the logic of DeFi money Legos.  Ramming deposits from Saber-to-Cashio-to-Crate-to-Arrow-to-Sunny-or-Quarry had even bigger implications for Saber. According to Ian, it turned $1 of apparent TVL into $6. Many DeFi projects measure their worth by touting total user deposits: TVL.  “TVL can only count if protocols are built separately,” Ian wrote, explaining why his anons’ protocols appeared to be separately built.  According to TVL tracker DeFiLlama, Saber’s deposits peaked at $4.15 billion on Sept. 11 2021; its flagship SBR token had topped out at 90 cents days earlier. Sunny Aggregator’s TVL also peaked on Sept. 11, at $3.4 billion. Its SUNNY token had flirted with an all-time-high of 18 cents one day before.  Both tokens have plummeted 99%, according to data provider CoinGecko. Saber’s and Sunny’s TVL hardly fared better as they have both dropped by over 96%.  Fallen angels  Cashio’s March 23 implosion from a $52 million hack was a broadside against Ship Capital.  Ian said in the unpublished blog that he “pushed very hard for people to stake more into Cashio,” because he wrote its code. He apologized for their “catastrophic” losses in a protocol that he created using a pseudonym and endorsed under his true identity.  In the unpublished post, Ian begged the hacker – a self-styled Robin Hood-type who railed against American and European fat cats – “to consider returning the funds.” The hacker later did return $14 million of the $39 million that hack victims requested.  Ian wrote that if the hacker didn’t pay users back in full, “I will do what I can to repay affected personal users in my personal Saber and Sunny tokens. This won’t cover the full amount, but it’s all I have to offer.” He never made good on that unpublished pledge.  ‘A barrier for criticism’  Pseudonymity is widespread in crypto, and not in itself evidence of wrongdoing. Thirteen years after bitcoin’s debut, the true identity of its creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, remains unknown. Yet even after a recent brutal sell-off, the bellwether cryptocurrency boasts a $442 billion market capitalization.  Ian, however, wanted “a barrier for criticism,” according to the unpublished post:  “I only want to focus on building and creating value in my perception of what I believe is the best way of doing things. I do not want to deal with excessive criticism before my ideas are fully brought to market, and being anonymous is an easy way to distance myself (and the protocols I work on) from this.”  Ian’s arrival in Solanaland in October 2020, according to Discord server logs, was hardly the self-proclaimed “shipooor’s” first code rodeo. His GitHub commit history stretches back over a decade, with the first public crypto contribution, on an EOS project, in late 2017.  In early January 2021, Ian discussed the tokenomics of what he considered (rightly, it turned out) as a doomed-to-depeg stablecoin in the Discord for Basis.Cash. There, he became “obsessed” with building decentralized money.  Somewhere along the way, he tried and failed to “build a multiprotocol DeFi ecosystem” that ended “in criticism and ridicule,” Ian’s post said. “Moving to Solana was a way for me to reset that.”  Read more: UST’s Do Kwon Was Behind Earlier Failed Stablecoin, Ex-Terra Colleagues Say  Public statements  Who were these anonymous builders flocking to Saber? Ian grappled with the question at last year’s Solana conference in Lisbon, Portugal, during a panel called “From Zero to $2 Billion: How Saber Became the Biggest DeFi App on Solana.”  “We brought in some friends to basically build on top of Saber and just grow out the ecosystem,” Ian told Chris McCann of Race Capital, Saber’s biggest venture capital (VC) backer.  One “friend’s” project was Sunny; Crate, the tokenized basket-making protocol from Ian’s alias kiwipepper, was another.  “But that person also has, like a lot of friends that they know,” Ian told the audience. One of those friends-of-friends built Cashio, a stablecoin project backed by Saber LP tokens that fed liquidity into Sunny Aggregator, he claimed.  “We could promote [CASH] to get more liquidity into Saber,” he said on stage.  In a brief interview with CoinDesk Thursday, McCann said he was unaware of Ian’s intimate connection to Cashio.  “He’s always mentioned that there is somebody else that created it, but I do not know who the somebody else is nor have I met them.”  Ian’s unpublished blog reveals Cashio’s true origin. Coding as 0xGhostchain, Ian rushed to complete an exemplar of Saber LP-backed stablecoins in time for Breakpoint, the Solana ecosystem’s biggest-ever gathering of fellow developers. Ian wanted others to copy Cashio, he wrote. Each protocol that parroted its dependence on Saber LP tokens would become a liquidity spigot gushing yet more TVL into the $1.7 billion mothership.  “This is part of why the code was insecure, it was rushed for this deadline,” he wrote on March 26, after a hacker had spoofed Cashio’s unaudited smart contracts with fake collateral, draining it of $52 million.  Cashio’s Discord community – where passionate users roam – likely believed the CASH code was safe. After all, Ian told them on Nov. 23: “I personally audited” it. He pitched a similar yarn to crypto Twitter on March 23, the day of the exploit: “I did not audit Cashio as closely as I should have.”  Both statements contradict what Ian wrote in his unpublished letter:  “I didn’t get anyone else to look at the code, including an auditor. I should not have done this.”  Moving on  “It was always the goal to eventually have real people building projects,” Ian wrote in the unpublished blog.  On July 23, the brothers started wooing external developers to Saber with a “DAO accelerator program.” Its application form asks: “How will your protocol deeply integrate with the Saber Protocol thereby increasing Saber's volume/TVL/capital efficiency?”  That effort comes as the brothers cast off from Solana for Aptos, an up-and-coming blockchain – porting Saber with them. Many Solana developers are in tow, a venture capital source said. The Macalinaos are betting on it: they helm a VC that’s anchored in Aptos, three sources said. Their VC is called Protagonist. Its old name was “Ship Capital.”  Read more: Solana’s Macalinao Brothers Double Down on Crypto Venture Fund  Seven Saber ecosystem users told CoinDesk they felt abandoned by the Macalinao brothers. Some lost money in CASH tokens (the erstwhile stablecoin went to zero). Others say their crypto is stuck in derivative tokens issued by Sunny. One pseudonymous user, Brad_Garlic_Bread, said he lost around $300,000 across Sunny and Saber – “there's a lot of people worse off than me.”  Read more: ‘Curve Wars’ Heat Up: Emergency DAO Invoked After ‘Clear Governance Attack’  The community assumes Ian is running the show “but no one knows for sure,” Brad_Garlic_Bread said.  He’s still trying to get Ian’s attention. On July 16, Brad asked if Ian “can pretend to be Surya for like a day” to help Sunny Aggregator's investors recover locked tokens. Ian was answering questions in the Saber Discord; he skipped Brad’s.  Other SUNNY token-holders asked Ian for clues about the yield aggregator’s future. Saber is moving to Aptos – will Sunny do the same? They asked what became of Sunny’s lead developer.  “The main sunny dev got burned out after losing most of their savings from the Cashio hack,” Ian said on July 16. He said he would “encourage” this disenchanted dev to rebuild Sunny in Move, a coding language Ian says is safer than Solana’s Rust for building multi-million-dollar protocols.  One week later, Ian said the Sunny dev felt rejuvenated after giving Move a go.  “‘Feels like early Solana all over again.’”  UPDATE (Aug. 5, 18:22 UTC): Adds detail to tenth paragraph.

42411745,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfgLL,1659636051,Hot vs. Cold Crypto Wallets: What Are the Differences?,"After purchasing cryptocurrency, deciding how and where to store your assets is a very important step. Unlike physical currency, cryptocurrencies run on a blockchain, and therefore require digital storage systems called wallets. Like a cash wallet, a crypto wallet allows you to hold and transfer funds. There the similarities end. Crypto wallets consist of public and private keys, which are strings of characters that allow holders to receive and transfer their crypto assets.  There are two types of storage options for crypto wallets, depending on preference: ""hot"" storage and ""cold"" storage. Hot storage is an app or platform that is connected to the internet, while cold storage is stored offline, often through a physical device such as a thumb drive. While both hot and cold storage systems offer individuals access to their digital funds, they differ in user experience and security levels.  Which option is right for you is a matter of personal choice. The right answer may be a combination of the two options, depending on what you are looking to do with cryptocurrency in both the long and short term.  Hot vs. cold storage: Pros and cons  Hot storage refers to an application or platform that is connected to the internet and allows you to manage your cryptocurrency holdings. Many of these services are free and are available to use on a computer or mobile device. Some examples of hot wallets include the following software:  MetaMask: A popular browser plug-in that acts as a wallet for ether (ETH) and other ERC-20 tokens  Exodus: A desktop and mobile software that connects to the Exodus decentralized exchange and supports over 150 cryptocurrencies  Mycelium: An established, bitcoin-focused mobile application with local trading options  Some crypto exchanges, including Coinbase (COIN), Gemini and Binance, also offer wallets for seamless buying, trading and selling of cryptocurrency on their platforms.  Hot storage pros:  User friendly: Because they are always connected to the internet, these platforms allow you to store and access your cryptocurrency easily and from anywhere.  Cost: Most hot wallets are free to use.  Convenience: If you are using a hot wallet linked to a particular exchange, it is convenient to interact within that ecosystem.  Hot storage cons:  Security: While hot wallets are generally secure, they are connected to the internet and are therefore more vulnerable to being hacked.  Accessibility: Because they require a connection to the internet, some wallet features may be restricted in certain countries or jurisdictions, depending on local laws.  Cold storage, on the other hand, holds a user’s private keys offline and therefore adds an extra layer of security from potential hacks. While a hardware wallet is not an absolute requirement to move your crypto into cold storage, the majority of people will opt for a hardware solution such as:  Ledger: A USB-like device that allows users to buy, exchange and stake over 1,000 cryptocurrencies  Trezor: A small plug-in device that is compatible with over 1,000 cryptocurrencies and can be used on computers and mobile devices  Cold storage allows users to have full control over their private keys and assets, but also comes at a higher price point.  Cold storage pros:  Portability: Cold storage solutions are often small, plug-in devices that can be carried around wherever in the world you go and can easily be used to log into decentralized apps.  Security: Your private keys never leave the device and transactions are signed locally, making the devices significantly less vulnerable to cyberattacks.  Autonomy: Cold storage allows you to be the sole custodian of your crypto assets, eliminating third-party applications from your storage experience.  Cold storage cons:  Price: Hardware wallets can range between $79 and $255, making them more expensive than online options.  Transfers: Transfers between cold storage devices are slightly more cumbersome than hot storage wallets.  Layout: Some people may experience a learning curve on how to use the smaller screens on hardware devices.  Hot vs. cold: Which is safest?  While there have been several notable hacks linked to hot storage wallets, security measures continue to improve. In September 2020, about $281 million worth of crypto assets were compromised in a security breach of Singapore-headquartered exchange KuCoin, though most of the funds were later restored. In July 2019, Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Bitpoint lost about $32 million in user funds due to a hack.  Cold storage system Ledger had its user data compromised in July 2020, although no user funds were stolen.  Ultimately, there are several factors to consider when deciding whether to use a cold or hot storage wallet. Many people utilize a combination of both cold and hot storage options in order to create a secure and seamless transaction experience, Most exchanges, including Coinbase, keep user funds across a variety of cold storage options, which Coinbase refers to as the “gold standard of cryptocurrency asset security.” Generally, experts recommend that large amounts of cryptocurrency, or cryptocurrency assets that users do not need to access very often, should be held in cold storage.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | BNB,Rosie Perper,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/hot-vs-cold-crypto-storage-what-are-the-differences,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0de08d1eeb2ed134f50faefa4fb0a942395c733b-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Lattice will write $500,000 to $1.5 million checks out of the fund with plans to invest in 40 to 50 companies, Zajko said. Capital has already been deployed to nine companies, though the only deal that was publicly announced so far was for Optic, a startup that uses artificial intelligence to authenticate non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Optic announced an $11 million funding round last month.  The existence of the Lattice Capital II fund was revealed in a February regulatory filing, but Lattice exclusively confirmed to CoinDesk the size and details of the fund.  In a crowded venture capital landscape, Lattice stands out because of its work with founders of the companies it invests in, helping craft go-to-market strategies, and the firm’s focus on early investments, general partner Regan Bozman said.  The firm has strong ties to crypto exchange CoinList – Bozman was the first employee there and Zajko now runs sales and partnerships at CoinList in addition to working for Lattice – and can offer that knowledge to portfolio companies that plan to launch a token.  The firm isn't deterred by the crypto bear market.  “We continue to be impressed by the talent entering the crypto space and welcome a bear market as an advantageous time for committed investors like us to partner with promising new projects that are as excited to build in a bears as a bull,” Zajko said.

Avalanche was recently rejected at $25 due to strong selling activity which precipitated a rebound seen in the last week of July.

42411740,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfgBQ,1659624673,A Crypto Must-Know: Public vs. Private Keys,"If you've looked into getting a crypto wallet, you may hear that it comes with a key. In fact, it comes with two keys: a public key and a private key. They are both essential and they do different, complementary jobs.  Public keys  The public key is used to send cryptocurrency into a wallet. The private key is used to verify transactions and prove ownership of a blockchain address. If someone sends you, say one bitcoin (BTC), a private key will be required to “unlock” that transaction and prove that you are now the owner of that bitcoin.  Think of your public key as your mailing address. Anyone can look it up and send things, in this case cryptocurrency, to that address. It's similar to providing your checking account number and routing number to set up a direct deposit – you can tell that information to anyone, but it doesn't allow them to withdraw money or otherwise log in to your account.  Private keys  The private key on the other hand is for the wallet owner only. The private key functions as a password to your crypto wallet and should be kept secret. The thing you must understand is that if someone discovers your private key, they will have access to all the crypto in that wallet and can do whatever they want with it.  Private keys are numerical codes – but you may never see your actual private key. To make things more user-friendly, many wallet providers often encode your private key in a way that you can more easily record and remember.  Many wallets use a ""seed phrase,"" also known as a ""secret recovery phrase,"" to unlock your wallet. If you open a crypto wallet with MetaMask, you will be assigned a string of random words that you use to unlock your funds. Your private key is hidden inside the software behind this user-friendly string of words.  Read More: What Is a Seed Phrase?  However, if you keep your crypto in an exchange wallet (such as Coinbase or Binance) or with a custodian, then that company holds your private key for you. Strictly speaking, it would control your funds on your behalf.  Learn More: Custodial vs. Non-Custodial Wallets  The function of the private key, technically speaking, is to ""sign"" transactions that use your funds. Transactions using your funds cannot be validated by the network without your private key attached. The public key encrypts transactions, which can be decrypted only by the corresponding private key. The technology is called public-key cryptography, sometimes abbreviated PKC, or asymmetric cryptography.  How to store your private key  A final note that cannot be stressed enough is that you must keep your private key or seed phrase or both safe and secret. Write it down and store it in several places as there is no way to recover it if you lose it or it gets into the wrong hands. Don't take a screenshot of it or take a picture with your phone as these digital copies are often targeted by hackers.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | BNB,Benedict George,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/a-crypto-must-know-public-vs-private-keys,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2e0bfe15883f8b27dfbedd12338decc60bca6ed9-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The price of SOL looked strong in the early part of the week, trading above $40, trying to break the resistance before having an attack on some wallets drained more than $8 million from Solana users. It now struggles to break above the 50 exponential moving average (EMA) on the one-hour (1H) chart. SOL Daily Chart Analysis The daily chart for SOL shows it is trading at $38.7 below the 50 &amp; 200 exponential moving average after a reject from reclaiming this region early this week. This means SOL will need to break above this resistance claimed earlier; this has been a region SOL has struggled to reclaim on the daily chart. The volume of SOL indicates there are no buy activities due to the recent incident that has affected the price of SOL. For SOL to trade higher in price, it needs to break this daily resistance of $40.9; else, we could see some pullbacks to the region of $36.6 if bulls do not step in. The region of $36.6 is a strong demand zone where more buyers in recent times have seen SOL in a good position to accumulate. Major resistance on the daily chart - $40.9.

The pound dropped against the dollar.  Market Moves: Omkar Godbole looks at a rare signal hinting bitcoin could be at market bottom and why this might be the best time to add exposure to the cryptocurrency.  Chart of The Day: The ether-bitcoin ratiobreaks eight-month bearish trendline.  This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price point  There hasn’t been a lot of exciting news this week for bitcoin (BTC) – a possible explanation for its six-day losing streak through Wednesday. But it’s not falling out of bed, either. Over the course of the slide the price of the notoriously volatile cryptocurrency has only lost about 4%.  BTC appeared unaffected by the news that the Bank of England (BOE) raised key interest rates by half a percentage point on Thursday, amid concern U.K. inflation will be over 10% next year.  The bank raised its key rate to 1.75% from 1.25%, the largest single step in more than a quarter-century.  The sterling dropped heavily against the dollar following the statement.  Ether (ETH) was trading down 3% on the day while other altcoins were all mostly in the red. Exceptions included tokens associated with Tezos (XTZ), Fantom (FTM) and Near Protocol (NEAR), which were all up by 2% over the last 24 hours.  In other news, asset management giant BlackRock (BLK) has partnered with the publicly traded crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) to make crypto directly available to institutional investors.  Mutual customers of Coinbase and BlackRock’s investment management platform, Aladdin, will have access to crypto trading, custody, prime brokerage and reporting capabilities, according to a blog post Thursday.  Saylor puts full focus on bitcoin  MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock was up nearly 15% on Wednesday, after news broke the prior evening that Michael Saylor is stepping down as CEO to become executive chairman with a sole focus on the company’s bitcoin strategy.  A new report from blockchain analytics company Chainalysis estimates that $2 billion worth of crypto has been siphoned out of cross-chain bridges this year alone, which includes this week's $190 million Nomad bridge exploit.  Developers behind the Solana blockchain are saying the closed-source Slope wallet may be responsible for the ongoing exploit this week that has resulted in millions of dollars’ worth of crypto tokens being stolen from more than 9,000 hot wallets.  A crypto warning for Turkey  Finally, check out this opinion piece from Burak Tamac, senior researcher at CryptoQuant, and economist Erkan Oz on lessons from the Turkish government’s hasty attempt to regulate cryptocurrencies. The authors believe that the government’s views on crypto is a restriction on freedom, and is not only ethically and constitutionally wrong but also would worsen the country’s capital outflow problem rather than solving it.

Even so, traders often attempt to predict one based on how the price behaved relative to critical indicators during previous bear runs. The assumption here is that history will repeat itself.  One such rare signal has emerged, suggesting bitcoin's decline may be flattening and now is the best time to add exposure to the cryptocurrency.  The bitcoin mining difficulty ribbon, comprising short- and long-duration simple moving averages on the mining difficulty, has compressed for the first time in over a year, indicating miner capitulation. The previous bear markets, including the one seen in 2014, ended with the ribbon compression, data provided by analytics firm Glassnode show.  ""The bitcoin ribbon data set has historically proven to be an optimal entry point indicator and I believe this time it will show its predictive power again,"" Markus Thielen, chief investment officer at British Virgin Islands-based IDEG Asset Management (IDEG), said in an email. ""We are also entering the 18-months pre-bitcoin-halving period (September 2022) - a time window where bitcoin prices tended to boom out.""  Miner capitulation occurs when those responsible for minting coins shut down operations, resulting in a decline in the hashrate and mining difficulty. That reduces the selling pressure, allowing for price stability and an eventual bull revival. Miners often sell coins mined to fund operational costs, adding to bearish pressures in the market.  The ribbon includes 9-, 14-, 25-, 40-, 60-, 90-, 128- and 200-day simple moving averages on mining difficulty, a measure of how difficult it is to mine a block and verify transactions in bitcoin's blockchain.  Recently, several miners have capitulated to stay solvent. Mining difficulty is adjusted every two weeks. The number of participants in the mining network and their total mining power determines whether the difficulty is adjusted lower or higher.  Read the full story here.

42395081,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWv2W,1659618999,CME to Roll Out Euro-Denominated Bitcoin and Ether Futures on Aug. 29,"Bitcoin traders will soon have an option to trade euro-dominated bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) futures contracts on a regulated exchange.  Derivatives giant Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) announced on Thursday that it would roll out bitcoin euro and ether euro futures contracts on Aug. 29, pending regulatory approval.  The contract size for bitcoin futures will be 5 BTC while the ether contract will be sized at 50 ETH. Both contracts will be cash settled, based on the CME CF Bitcoin-Euro Reference Rate and CME CF Ether-Euro Reference Rate.  The launch of euro-denominated bitcoin and ether futures contracts could accelerate the ongoing institutionalization of the crypto market because the euro, the common currency of 19 out of the 27 member states of the European Union, is the second-most-desired currency in global currency reserves, according to the World Economic Forum. Further, daily turnover in the euro-dollar pair is the highest in the global currency market, which has an average daily volume of $6.6 trillion.  ""Our bitcoin-euro and ether-euro futures contracts will provide clients with more precise tools to trade and hedge exposure to the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap,"" Tim McCourt, global head of equity and FX products, CME Group, said in a press release.  ""Euro-denominated cryptocurrencies are the second-highest-traded fiat behind the U.S. dollar. Year-to-date, the EMEA region represents 28% of total bitcoin and ether futures contracts traded – up more than 5% versus 2021,"" McCourt added.  The euro has been quite volatile this year and fell to parity with the dollar last month, the lowest in nearly 20 years.  The CME listed a dollar-denominated bitcoin futures contract in December 2017 and dollar-denominated ether futures contract in Feb. 2021. The exchange, considered a proxy for institutional activity, has also rolled out micro bitcoin and ether futures contracts sized at one-tenth of the standard contracts.  At press time, the derivatives giant was the fourth-largest bitcoin futures exchange, accounting for 1.5% ($1.6 billion) of the global open interest of $11.8 billion, according to data tracked by analytics firm Skew.

A customer booked a $2,000 USDC stay at a property in London through a property owner who listed his home through the BNB chain-based company’s V2 of its pilot program, which has been in beta for the past month.  Dtravel’s first smart contract-based booking comes after a monthslong effort to make the site more user-friendly while still upholding principles of Web3. Binance-backed travel booking site Travala.com first announced the release of the Dtravel platform in June 2021 and launched the initial version in November 2021.  Dtravel head of growth Cynthia Huang told CoinDesk that early users voiced a desire for greater autonomy in the marketplace the company had originally built.  They took the early months of 2022 to listen to user feedback and research its approach to empower hosts to have ownership over their bookings, transactions and payment options.  “The huge value proposition that we have with this product specifically is that hosts truly own their own smart contract and they own the payment flow of that, too,” said Huang.  With the site’s implementation of direct bookings, users can book stays directly from the owner on the BNB chain. The smart contract is run between the renter and the host, eliminating all third-party platforms and giving the hosts full autonomy over the terms of their hospitality.  Users can pay their hosts for their stays in stablecoins such as UDSC, USDT and BUSD. Huang said the company is exploring in the coming months the possibility of being multichain, as well as incorporating additional cryptocurrency payment options.  Dtravel is also working on bolstering its community through its DAO. With its native token TRVL, homeowners and renters can vote on proposals such as building new marketing features or host tools for the platform.  It’s also looking to onboard users newer to the crypto space, rather than solely experienced Travala users. Huang said Dtravel plans to incorporate more login options and wallet integrations for those joining the platform from Web2, as well as give TRVL tokens to guests to encourage governance participation to get acquainted with the DAO.  Huang told CoinDesk that Dtravel will be available to the public in the next two months.

42395077,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWuya,1659618000,Cosmos-Based Liquid Staking Protocol Stride Raises $6.7M,"Ahead of its mainnet launch early this month, Stride – a liquid staking protocol for the Cosmos blockchain ecosystem – raised $6.7 million in a seed funding round led by North Island VC, Distributed Global and Pantera Capital.  “We’re primarily going to hire engineers to help build out the protocol,” Stride co-founder Vishal Talasani told CoinDesk in an interview. “We also want to hire one to two security people to full-time focus on how to make the chain really secure.”  How it works  Proof-of-stake blockchains maintain their integrity through staked or committed assets. Liquid staking allows users to earn yield on those locked assets through an equivalent number of new tokens. Stride offers liquid staking, a network of proof-of-stake blockchains that interact with one another through the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol.  Read more: What Is Cosmos?  Stride lets users stake tokens from any Cosmos chain in exchange for stTokens. The staked assets can earn an auto-compounding staking yield and can earn additional yield through actions like lending and providing liquidity. The stTokens can be sold or used in DeFi (decentralized finance) applications.  The “Tokens” part of ""stTokens"" is a placeholder for the staked asset. For example, Stride currently offers staking support for Cosmos Hub – one of the first chains launched on Cosmos – and the native ATOM token is exchanged for stATOM. Stride plans to add support for more IBC-compatible assets by the end of the year.  Mitigating risks  Stride lets users redeem the stTokens for the original asset at any time. The capability helps mitigate risks of locked-in liquid staking, which can leave users stranded if the staked and original assets start to lose their peg, or 1:1 equivalence – an issue that hit the Ethereum-staked sETH tokens in June due to market volatility.  Stride has been audited by blockchain security firms CertiK and Oak Security.  “After launch, we plan to have additional audits given that liquid staking has a kind of unique place where it custodies, or holds onto, funds on behalf of users. It’s a high-profile target for hacks,” said Talasani.

42411424,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNeY7,1659617400,Advisors Should Look Before Clients Leap Into DeFi,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) has been in the news a lot lately, but not always for the right reasons.  DeFi projects have the ability to offer people eye-popping yields in excess of 10% per year.  But these projects can be opaque and risky. They often lure investors into scams or poorly constructed protocols.  “Remember that old expression: If it seems too good to be true, it probably is,” said Michael Rosmer, co-founder and CEO of DeFiYield.  DeFiYield offers a product in two parts – one is a security layer for smart contracts to help investors avoid getting scammed or hacked, the other is a cross-chain asset management platform that Rosmer describes as a kind of “Robinhood for crypto.”  “The perspective that I take, as an investor, is that I want to understand what’s going on with the things I put my money into and where the returns are coming from,” Rosmer said.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.  Even if the projects are credible, they can offer returns that are unsustainable. The super-high yields offered by some of these DeFi projects only exist because they are new and represent just a handful of participants enjoying elevated early returns.  “In DeFi, in some cases, it’s just unsustainable, it’s not going to work out,” Rosmer said. “What’s totally fair is that these yields are not going to last. The super-high yields are short-term yields and things normalize as more participants become involved.”  Let’s look at how DeFi works and why these yields are unsustainable before addressing what red flags to look out for.  Two flavors of yield-generating DeFi  How do decentralized finance projects work?  Imagine trading on a traditional finance exchange. Typically, buyers bidding on securities don’t perfectly match up with sellers asking prices. There are market makers who act in the middle to facilitate trades to make it easier on everyone else.  In decentralized finance, there are automated market makers. Algorithms take on the middleman responsibilities for crypto trading.  In order to generate yield in DeFi, users have a couple of options.  One option is lending. Depositing tokens on a DeFi platform so that they can be loaned out to borrowers is a way for DeFi users to generate yield. Depositors collect regular interest payments from borrowers.  Another option is liquidity pools, which don’t bear direct resemblance to traditional finance.  The way liquidity pools work is that participants deposit two different tokens – say ether (ETH) and tether (USDT) – into a pool. The pool of deposited tokens can then facilitate liquidity for others who want to buy or sell each of the tokens. The people depositing the tokens earn a reward every time a transaction takes place.  “If there are a lot of people trading and not a lot of money deposited into the liquidity pool, the money is being reused time after time and the rewards earned can add up to quite a bit when they’re compounded,” said Rosmer. “Early on, people will get a great return.”  Read more: The Era of Easy DeFi Yields Is Over  Liquidity pools are especially important to new DeFi projects that are trying to create enough liquidity so others can easily trade their tokens.  In these cases, projects will create incentives for early participants in their liquidity pools, literally paying them liquidity tokens that help artificially juice their returns from participating in the project. However, as more people participate over time, the incentives will be withdrawn.  “You’re really bribing people to give some liquidity to allow users to come and swap tokens, and how well it will work in the long term is an interesting conversation,” Rosmer said. “Maybe the incentives will have to change.”  The general trend in DeFi is that returns tend to decline over time as more participants become involved in projects. The more people there are providing liquidity, the greater the distribution of incentives becomes. In other words, decentralized finance projects trend towards more efficiency as they mature.  Red flags  As investors, we want to exercise appropriate precaution before putting our money into a liquidity vault.  One precaution we want to take is to make sure we know who is launching the protocols where we are getting involved.  Among the first liquidity vaults we may look at are projects like Convex, Balancer and Vancor. They are the blue chips of DeFi. These are big protocols with a lot of participants and the returns aren’t great.  Read more: Why DeFi Giants Aave, Curve May Want Their Own Stablecoins  However, when looking elsewhere for higher returns, we have to be careful.  “What happens in DeFi is that anyone can launch a protocol and do so very quickly,” Rosmer said. “Oftentimes they do not show who they are or discuss the project in an open ecosystem, but they do offer great incentives or the potential for large returns.”  This can create opportunities for bad actors to conduct scams. In particular, bad actors can write code into DeFi projects that allows them to siphon off money from the liquidity vault.  One good example of these bad actors is “infinite minting.” This is where a new liquidity token is created with a smart contract that gives them the ability to create an unlimited number of that token. This allows them to go into the project’s vault and trade that liquidity token for all of the ether or USDT in the vault. As the value of the liquidity token goes to zero, the founder of the smart contract absconds with the assets of value.  “There are all kinds of opportunities for people to go and essentially rob unsuspecting investors who don’t know how to read code,” Rosmer said. “People are lured in by the attractive gains and don’t understand what they are getting themselves into.”",NEUTRAL,USDT,BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING | USDT,Christopher Robbins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/08/04/advisors-should-look-before-clients-leap-into-defi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/01872f0393e777ffbf65ad3c41d078b63f0c8bff-3982x2987.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42411420,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNeOC,1659617400,Bitcoin Doesn’t Need Yield When Holding Will Suffice,"Advisors, how many clients have you heard tell you they want passive income? Let me rephrase that – name me one client who hasn’t told you they want passive income?  The chase for yield has and will continue to be one of the most difficult challenges an advisor faces from an investment standpoint.  I want to challenge the notion that clients will need passive income or yield if bitcoin (BTC) is their unit of account. Why would you risk a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of high double digits for 6% or even 10%?  Not only are the risks of chasing yields in crypto space high, the idea of seeking a yield on bitcoin does not make fundamental sense since holding it should suffice.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.  So before seeking a yield on bitcoin, let’s look at some of the risks of crypto yields and then consider why bitcoin is an outstanding currency to hold due to its deflationary traits.  Yield on bitcoin isn’t worth the risk  The recent events from centralized finance, or CeFi, lenders show clearly that yields aren’t worth the risk. The bankruptcies of Celsius Network and Voyager Digital are significant lessons that if you don’t understand where the yield comes from it’s best to stay away. Speculation and wild risk-taking became rampant, and yield farmers who left their crypto on those platforms were left holding the bag.  Celsius promised quick and outsized yields – as large as 18% – in order to attract hordes of new users to its platform. They subsidized the yields and took on losses in order to quickly boost their user base. Because the yields were subsidized, they were essentially fake and comparable to a Ponzi scheme.  Voyager had also successfully attracted loads of yield-hungry depositors, but it made poor decisions on whom to lend that money. Its biggest lending customer, Three Arrows Capital, had large exposure to the LUNA token. When LUNA imploded, it caused a domino effect that led to the bankruptcy of Three Arrows and, consequently, Voyager.  Although the yields in some cases throughout the industry were advertised in the high double digits, the grand majority of the yields were a mere 6% to 9%. Which begs the question: Why risk a scarce asset that is appreciating 53% annually the last five years for a paltry single-digit yield?  Yield on bitcoin is unnecessary  The idea of yield comes from an ever-expanding money supply – the “yield” you need is to offset the newly created units. The reason we are obsessed with yield is that the number of dollars in circulation has significantly increased and shows no signs of slowing down.  Bitcoin doesn’t need a yield because you don’t need to offset the increase in the money supply. Unlike dollars that are inflationary and can be printed in endless quantities, Bitcoin is deflationary and capped at a supply of 21 million units.  Read more: To Understand Bitcoin, We Need to Understand What Money Is  With dollars, your yield is to help you maintain purchasing power over time. But you don’t need to find yield to keep pace if you have a scarce asset. A great example is the median home price in the U.S. – in 2018 it cost 24.5 bitcoin to own and today it is 20 bitcoin. If we had saved in dollars you’d need 30% more today than in 2018 for that same purchase.  In other words, simply holding bitcoin would have increased your purchasing power over time, unlike holding dollars that would have reduced your purchasing power during that same period of time.  Money that cannot be increased holds its value better. If money holds its value, there is no need for yield since holding it suffices. Holding a currency is saving. Lending out a currency puts it at risk and thus needs a return or yield.  Deflation promotes saving, which is good, and bitcoin allows this to happen. Inflation erodes the value of savings, which is bad. Expanding the dollar supply causes inflation and encourages debt and speculation, which rarely turns out well. If you need a refresher on why this is the case, read Jeff Both’s seminal book called ""The Price of Tomorrow."" The book will challenge those voices who claim inflation is needed for a well-run and functioning economy. All advisors should place this next on their reading list.  Bitcoin allows for saving (""hodling"") to increase purchasing power and then investing only when it makes sense to put funds at risk. Bitcoin seems risky, but you trade short-term volatility for long-term stability.  Read more: Compounding and Saving in Bitcoin: The Power of a Dollar-Cost Averaging Strategy  Bitcoin can be held to navigate the unknowns of the future. We can effectively save bitcoin, unlike dollars, knowing the protocol rules will be defended. Those rules include bitcoin’s hard cap supply of 21 million and its decentralized traits. A great example of rules being defended is the ""Block Size Wars.""  The rule set and historical precedent demonstrate those who save in bitcoin don’t need yield to maintain purchasing power. Therefore, clients can benefit from living below their means – to save into bitcoin!",NEGATIVE,BTC | LUNA,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | LUNA | TRADING,Isaiah Douglass,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/08/04/bitcoin-doesnt-need-yield-when-holding-will-suffice,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/72c30c7ba7ece090d9e8e38c9c273c53052c6350-3933x2949.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The multimillion-dollar loss is the latest in a series of security breaches to hit crypto companies this year and the third multimillion-dollar hack reported this week.  Blockchain security company PeckShield called attention to the likely exploit that seems to have drained $4.8 million in tether (USDT), polygon (MATIC), shiba inu (SHIB) and other digital currencies from the exchange’s hot wallet on Wednesday. Transaction records show that the tokens were later sold on several decentralized exchanges for ether (ETH).  ZB Exchange hasn't yet publicly responded to the hack and didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The firm did announce it is pausing withdrawals, citing “temporary maintenance,” in a blog post on Tuesday.  Several of the exchange’s users took to Twitter to voice concerns about how they would access their funds amid the freeze on withdrawals and to criticize the exchange’s silence on the suspected security breach.  In recent months, a series of multimillion-dollar exploits has rattled investor confidence in cryptocurrency markets and prompted many investors to become increasingly cautious of where they store their assets.  In June, a North Korean government-backed group plundered $100 million in altcoins from the Horizon bridge, a cross-chain bridge that enables token transfers between the Harmony blockchain and other networks. Then, earlier this week, hackers drained more than $5 million in tokens, including Solana's SOL token and USD coin (USDC), from around 8,000 Solana software wallets.  Also this week, cross-chain bridge Nomad suffered an exploit that drained nearly $190 million worth of crypto. According to a recent report from blockchain security firm Chainalysis, $2 billion worth of crypto has been siphoned out of cross-chain bridges so far this year, which accounts for 69% of the crypto theft this year.  Cross-chain bridges are used to send tokens between blockchains and are a popular tool used by the crypto community.  ZB Exchange, which once billed itself as the “world’s most secure” crypto exchange, was founded in 2013 under the name CHBTC.co and has over $1 billion in daily transaction volume.  The exchange, which used to be based in China, suspended its operations when regulators there banned fundraising through initial coin offerings in 2017. The move came after the Chinese central bank voiced concerns about the then largely popular and mostly unregulated fundraising method’s use in several financial scams.

Mutual customers of Coinbase and BlackRock’s investment management platform, Aladdin, will have access to crypto trading, custody, prime brokerage and reporting capabilities, according to a blog post Thursday.  BlackRock had $8.5 trillion in assets under management as of the second quarter of 2022, while Aladdin has more than 200 institutional users, including insurers, pensions, corporations, asset managers, banks and official institutions, according to a Thursday note from Oppenheimer.  Shares of Coinbase, which have declined sharply amidst the rout in crypto prices, jumped on the news, while those of BlackRock were up slightly to $693.11.  “Our institutional clients are increasingly interested in gaining exposure to digital asset markets and are focused on how to efficiently manage the operational lifecycle of these assets,” Joseph Chalom, global head of strategic ecosystem partnerships at BlackRock, said in the blog post.  “This connectivity with Aladdin will allow clients to manage their bitcoin exposures directly in their existing portfolio management and trading workflows for a whole portfolio view of risk across asset classes,” he added.  The access will be granted through Coinbase Prime, an existing integrated trading platform for institutional crypto investors. The companies will continue to develop the platform's integration and roll out different functions in phases, the blog post said.

Cross-chain bridges are used to send tokens between blockchains and are a popular tool used by the crypto community. Chainalysis said that the underlying technology of cross-chain bridges is still in its infancy and that many new models are being tested, leaving the software open to attack.  The most notable of the 13 cross-chain attacks this year was the Ronin Bridge exploit, which saw the protocol lose $625 million in ether (ETH) and USDC after being targeted by North Korean hacking group Lazarus.  This week, hackers exploited a vulnerability in Nomad, a popular bridge that is used to transfer assets from Moonbeam and Evmos to Ethereum.

Indeed, 47% of respondents in the 2022 CFA Institute Investor Trust Study indicated saving for retirement was their most important investment goal.Yet the conventional pathway to retirement savings - the traditional stock and bond portfolio - is not as effective as it used to be. Weaker diversification, declining real returns, and rising inflation all present major challenges to both defined benefit and defined contribution ((DC)) pension funds. As funds struggle to meet their return targets, investors are demanding they provide access to new and potentially riskier products.

42395084,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWv5T,1659610800,Gaming Claimed Record 60% of Blockchain Activity in July: DappRadar,"Blockchain-based game playing was a bright spot in DappRadar’s most recent report summarizing key industry themes in July.  “While [decentralized finance] and overall blockchain activity have been on the downside, game Unique Active Wallets (UAW) continues to rise, reaching almost 1 million daily wallets,” Pedro Herrera, DappRadar’s head of research, told CoinDesk in an email.  Game dapps contributed to 60% of overall blockchain activity in July, touching an all-time high.  “Although game tokens also suffer from challenging market conditions, blockchain games continue to be played at growing ratios. With relevant gaming events like The Sandbox Alpha Season 3, Illuvium’s Beta gameplay, Gala live games or Axie Infinity’s land staking available, Web3 games are shaping to be the industry’s driving force for months to come,” Herrera added.  NFTs  Non-fungible token (NFT) volumes have weakened during the crypto bear market, with volumes failing to reach $1 billion in trades for the first time since June 2021, according to DappRadar. NFT platform Yuga Labs stood out, comprising over 20% of the NFT market total trading volume in July.  NFT giant OpenSea remains the dominant marketplace, though its share of the market by trading volume has dropped to 60% for the first time since it was started, DappRadar found. It added that OpenSea peers, including X2Y2 on Ethereum and Solana’s Magic Eden, grabbed some of OpenSea's market share (84% in May). Further competition in the sector looms for OpenSea from the likes of GameStop and Nickelodeon’s recent NFT initiatives.  “The question remains whether NFTs can get back to the euphoria level experienced during the avatar craze and whether the crypto market can finally decouple from the capital markets that might suffer a rocky macro environment in the near future,” Herrera said.  What's next  “Overall, the dapp industry is responding well to the crypto winter and the turmoil from the crypto contagion. It remains to be seen whether the downfall of Terra and the [Three Arrows Capital] and Celsius [Network] bankruptcies still have more to uncover.

The Crypto and Digital Assets All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) is looking to compose a report with policy recommendations and will share its findings with the government, the group said Thursday.  The group is canvassing views from industry experts, crypto service providers, regulators and members of government on a range of topics including the U.K.'s current approach to regulating digital assets, the role of local regulators, the potential of central bank digital currencies (CBDC) and concerns related to financial crime and crypto advertising.  The inquiry comes shortly after July's introduction of a bill that includes provisions to bring payments-focused digital assets like stablecoins – which are pegged to the value of real assets like fiat currencies – into the scope of regulation.  As the U.K. maps its own path following Brexit, the stablecoin rules are expected to be part of a larger effort by the government to transform the state into an international crypto hub. The APPG inquiry plans to assess if the current approach to regulating crypto is aligned with the government’s ambitions, and look at what other countries are doing, it said.  Following the recent crypto market slump, which has seen several companies collapse and billions of dollars lost, regulators worldwide are scrambling to set up more robust crypto rules. Other major economies including the European Union and the U.S. have rules for stablecoins as well as licensing frameworks for crypto service providers in the works.  ""It's vital that the U.K. does not take its foot off the gas and that government and regulators keep to their commitments when it comes to crypto and digital assets,” Lisa Cameron, a Scottish National Party member of Parliament and the chair of the group, said in a statement.  The cross-party group, founded in 2021, is made up of members from both houses of Parliament. The APPG will be accepting written submissions on the detailed topics until Sept. 5.

But will this rally reach the $5 mark? Key Technical Points: The PancakeSwap (CAKE) price action shows a bullish breakout of the rising wedge pattern. The bullish reversal from the $3.85 mark teases a trend continuation to the $4.27 level. With a market cap of $569 million, the intraday trading volume of PancakeSwap has dropped by 44% to reach $68 million. Past Performance of CAKE As predicted in our previous article, the CAKE prices show a post-retest reversal from $3.85 with low price rejection candles retesting the broken resistance trendline. Moreover, the bullish reversal comes with a morning star pattern formed by the police engulfing the candle of a 4% jump last night. However, the buyers will have to undermine the higher price rejection due to the selling pressure near the $4.27 horizontal level.

The Virginia pension fund has invested $35 million each in Parataxis Capital’s digital yield fund and VanEck’s new finance income fund, both of which generate income for investors that provide liquidity to specific crypto entities, the report said.  Spearheaded by Chief Investment Officer Katherine Molnar, the $1.8 billion Fairfax County Police Officers Retirement System has made a series of crypto investments in the past alongside the Fairfax County Retirement Systems, which includes a $50 million investment in Morgan Creek's blockchain fund.  Molnar told the FT that potential returns in the yield farming sector are attractive because a lot of market participants have left the space.  The fund did not respond to CoinDesk's request for comment.  Crypto lender Celsius Network imploded in June after using an array of techniques to generate returns for depositing customers, including yield farming, which the company once described as ""high risk.""  This led to a period of market contagion that saw the likes of crypto broker Voyager Digital and hedge fund Three Arrows Capital fail, with both companies eventually filing for bankruptcy protection.  Canadian pension fund Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ) invested $150 million in Celsius Network before the lender was forced to halt operations.  ""A very small portion of our overall portfolio is invested in new technologies, which feature innovative, high-growth companies in riskier sectors that offer the potential for superior returns,"" a CDPQ spokesperson told CoinDesk last week.  But Fairfax County, part of the greater Washington, D.C., area, remains unperturbed by the market downturn.

42374121,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvXiDD,1659601503,Rare Signal Hinting at Bitcoin Price Bottom Emerges,"Predicting a bear market bottom is like catching a falling knife. Even so, traders often attempt to predict one based on how the price behaved relative to critical indicators during previous bear runs. The assumption here is that history will repeat itself.  One such rare signal has emerged, suggesting bitcoin's decline may be flattening and now is the best time to add exposure to the cryptocurrency.  The bitcoin mining difficulty ribbon, comprising short and long-duration simple moving averages on the mining difficulty, has compressed for the first time in over a year, indicating miner capitulation. The previous bear markets, including the one seen in 2014, ended with the ribbon compression, data provided by analytics firm Glassnode show.  ""The bitcoin ribbon data set has historically proven to be an optimal entry point indicator and I believe this time it will show its predictive power again,"" Markus Thielen, chief investment officer at British Virgin Islands-based IDEG Asset Management (IDEG), said in an email. ""We are also entering the 18-months pre-bitcoin-halving period (September 2022) – a time window where bitcoin prices tended to boom out.""  Miner capitulation occurs when those responsible for minting coins shut down operations, resulting in a decline in the hashrate and mining difficulty. That reduces the selling pressure, allowing for price stability and an eventual bull revival. Miners often sell coins mined to fund operational costs, adding to bearish pressures in the market.  The ribbon includes 9-, 14-, 25-, 40-, 60-, 90-, 128- and 200-day simple moving averages on mining difficulty, a measure of how difficult it is to mine a block and verify transactions in bitcoin's blockchain.  Recently several miners have capitulated to stay solvent. Mining difficulty is adjusted every two weeks. The number of participants in the mining network and their total mining power determines whether the difficulty is adjusted lower or higher.  While the latest difficulty ribbon compression offers hope to battered bulls, the positive signal should be read in conjunction with macro factors that point to a low probability of a quick bullish reversal.  On Wednesday, U.S. Federal Reserve officials said further monetary tightening is necessary to control inflation, pushing back against market belief that the central bank will slow rate hikes in the coming months and resort to easing next year. The Fed's liquidity tightening has roiled asset markets this year.  In addition, the difficulty ribbon is entirely based on miner flows, which now account for a small portion of the overall market and so may be a less-reliable indicator than before 2020. Bitcoin has evolved as a macro asset over the past two years as a result of increased institutional participation.

The Sango Initiative comes out of the Central Africa Republic (CAR), a country with vast resources worth more than $3 trillion.

With a market cap of $49.12 billion, the intraday trading volume of Binance has dropped by 89% to reach $2.26 billion. Past Performance of BNB As predicted in our previous article, the BNB price retests the broken range, and with the 100 SMA acting as a bullish launchpad, the trend reverses to crack above $300. The successful post-retest reversal comes after multiple Doji candles near the $280 mark. Moreover, the bullish engulfing candle of 4.90% jump undermines the declining trend due to supply pressure at $295.

42374120,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvXiBx,1659586379,Coinbase Asks US Supreme Court to Halt Lawsuits Connected to Scams and Dogecoin: Report,"Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) has reportedly asked the U.S. Supreme Court, the highest-level federal court, to send two recently filed lawsuits to arbitration, according to Bloomberg.  Federal trial judges in both cases had previously rejected Coinbase's move to send the disputes to arbitration, which the exchange said was required under its user agreements. Coinbase is effectively appealing these initial decisions.  The cases are Bielski v. Coinbase, 22A91, and Suski v. Coinbase 22A92.  Coinbase v. Bielski was filed by California resident Abraham Bielski, who lost over $31,000 after being targeted by a scammer who purported to be a PayPal (PYPL) representative and accessed Bielski’s Coinbase account. Bielski claimed Coinbase provided little help in regaining the lost funds and accused Coinbase of violating the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E therein.  On the other hand, in Suski v. Coinbase the exchange is accused of violating California consumer law by holding an allegedly misleading $1.2 million “sweepstakes” event involving meme coin dogecoin (DOGE) without including adequate disclaimers and disclosures about the nature of the sweepstakes.  The complaint alleged traders felt they had to buy or sell $100 in dogecoin by June 10, 2021, for a chance to win a cash prize, but Coinbase failed to specify users who do not trade dogecoin could take part in the event as well – leading to some feeling misled.  Coinbase has asked the Supreme Court both to intervene on an emergency basis and to take up the company's appeals.  It added that trial court proceedings should automatically stop when a party files a non-frivolous appeal seeking to send a case to arbitration, arguing that such issues arise “in every case in which a party appeals the denial of a motion to compel arbitration.”  At the Supreme Court, Coinbase says the trial court proceedings should stop while the company presses its appeal at the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
