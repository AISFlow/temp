The Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank of Brazil, the Securities Commission, and the  Superintendent of Private Insurance recently announced their intention to adapt new regulations to manage fintech and cryptocurrency advances.  The regulations will affect Brazil’s securities, financial, and capital markets, according to the regulators.  The institutions will also create a regulatory sandbox in the hopes of understanding and allowing concessions for new fintech ideas.  Money Impulse  The increasing commercial activity surrounding new technologies is the main reason behind the regulatory sandbox initiative.  “The use of innovative technologies as distributed ledger technology, blockchain, robo-advisors and artificial intelligence has allowed the rise of new business models, reflecting a bigger offer and reach,"" the regulators said.  In the case of blockchain, the Secretary of Treasury talked about the utility of DLT in Brazil’s financial markets. It also referred to cryptocurrencies and ICOs for financing.  Brazil currently has the highest number of cryptocurrency holders in Latin America and occupies the fifth position globally. Experts estimate that 8% of Brazil’s population will own some form of cryptoasset by 2019.  The new regulatory initiative comes after the announcement of regulation on cryptocurrencies earlier this year by the Financial Supervision Counsel of Brazil. In this case, the regulation follow the same rules as in money laundering, with fines as high as $5 million for scofflaws.  Looking for recognition  As regulatory efforts defining the limits of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology use in business, an increasing number of Brazilian merchants that work with cryptocurrencies still lack proper classification in the financial market.  The lack of recognition by financial entities sabotages the growth of the blockchain and cryptocurrency, keeping new businesses from properly participating in the fintech space. Representatives in the field pointed out that despite regulations, banks still can close or deny bank accounts to businesses that work with new, untested financial technologies.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Diana Aguilar,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/06/17/brazilian-financial-authorities-announce-regulatory-sandbox-for-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d7c3fdc75940e416d706653ed7778159344f2395-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Under the deal, according to the Wall Street Journal and Fortune, Ripple will spend $30 million to buy shares at a price of $4.10 apiece. And in the next two years, MoneyGram has the option to sell an additional $20 million worth of shares to Ripple at the same price. As noted by the Journal, MoneyGram shares were trading at about $1.45 apiece at the close of day, meaning Ripple's purchase price is close to three times the current market value.  Notably, the deal will also see MoneyGram utilizing the digital token XRP as part of its day-to-day operations by way of Ripple's xRapid transaction product. MoneyGram said that it was piloting the token back in January 2018, as CoinDesk reported at the time.  MoneyGram already services 200 countries and territories, with roughly $600 billion processed in the global remittance market. At present, the company uses traditional foreign exchange markets, which requires pre-funding accounts. Ripple and MoneyGram anticipate settlement fees dropping from $30 per transaction to ""fractions of a penny,"" while settlement times are expected to drop from 15-60 minutes to just a few seconds.  In a statement, MoneyGram CEO Alex Holmes said ""it's imperative that we continue to improve our platform and provide the most effective solution to get funds from point A to point B.""  He added:  ""Through Ripple’s xRapid product, we will have the ability to instantly settle funds from US dollars to destination currencies on a 24/7 basis, which has the potential to revolutionize our operations and dramatically streamline our global liquidity management.""

42402999,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAde9Od,1560792798,Tendermint Says Last Month's Cosmos Vulnerability Exposed Security Loophole,"The developers behind the Cosmos network released today a full disclosure of last month's ""critical security vulnerability"" which reportedly enabled hackers to bypass certain penalties for misbehavior on the network.  Zaki Manian, director at Tendermint Inc – the for-profit entity behind the core technology of the Cosmos network – detailed to Coindesk in an interview:  ""The key is we want to make it really difficult to misbehave in the network and then un-stake your tokens immediately and escape the consequences of that misbehavior...like voting for something bad in governance [or] the more complex things are double signage against an exchange to potentially reverse state.""  Normally, Cosmos validators – which are the equivalent to miners on a proof-of-work blockchain network – that do misbehave either by voting haphazardly or signing off on false transactions are penalized by having their staked ATOM tokens slashed. This is made possible through a minimum wait period of 21 days that prevent validators from un-staking their ATOM tokens before the network is able to sufficiently detect and screen their actions.  As stated in today's post by the Tendermint team, the code vulnerability discovered last month could enable a validator to bypass the full un-staking or ""un-bonding"" period ""and have their funds immediately become liquid essentially insta-unbonding.""  ""Within the first 24 hours of receiving the bug report, our tooling detected ~22 events total,"" the team wrote.  Having gone live this past March, Cosmos is a relatively new blockchain network that is designed to improve the interoperability between differing blockchain platforms. A reported $16 million was raised in an initial coin offering back in 2017.  The security vulnerability disclosed today was actually found in ""the staking module"" of the Cosmos Software Development Kit (SDK) which debuted back in 2018 as a ""state-of-the-art"" blockchain toolkit. It was detailed at the time as ""another way to build blockchains, safely and easily"" in a prior blog post.  Lessons learnt  Jessy Irwin, Tendermint's head of security, said in interview with CoinDesk that while the vulnerability disclosed today is the first of its kind to impact the Cosmos main network, ""it's not the first bug that has been reported to us.""  ""We've gone through seven security audits and we've had multiple issues raised and then we've also had a pretty active bug bounty program,"" said Irwin. ""We've invested quite a bit in the past year and a half since I joined the team in creating an environment where people report bugs instead of do nothing about them.""  The vulnerability, now fully patched on the Cosmos network, did require Cosmos validators to execute an emergency hard fork or system-wide upgrade. The update was activated on May 31 at block number 482,100.  Irwin highlighted that in order for this hard fork to execute successfully without resulting in a network split, urgent notice need to be pushed to all Cosmos validators and other service providers who were running Cosmos software on their computers.  Moving forward, Irwin told CoinDesk that one of the biggest lessons learnt from the security disclosure and upgrade process was a greater need for secure communication channels with Cosmos validators and other service providers.  Irwin emphasized:  ""We're really going to be advocating for our hub of validators and exchanges to open up their own channels for security communications ... We are working really hard with our validator set to open that up so that next time we're not running around and scrambling for information to get in touch with them.""

In a conversation with CoinDesk, Roubini – also nicknamed ""Dr. Doom"" for his prediction of the financial crash in 2007 and 2008 – said:  ""It has nothing to do with blockchain. Fully private, controlled, centralized, verified and authorized by a small number of permissioned nodes. So what is crypto or blockchain about it? None.""  Indeed, according to recent reports, the social media giant has signed up more than a dozen backers for its GlobalCoin cryptocurrency, a stablecoin apparently to be backed by a basket of fiat currencies. Each of the new backers – which reportedly include Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and Uber – will invest roughly $10 million in the project as part of a governing consortium for the cryptocurrency.  While he acknowledged that specifics of the project are not yet known (but are expected to be revealed in a white paper Tuesday), Roubini suggested that it is unlikely that GlobalCoin would use common blockchain technologies such as proof-of-work or proof-of-stake. ""Why would they?"" he said.  And while many in the crypto community have also criticized those calling Facebook's token a cryptocurrency, the economist denied that he shared any common ground with the ""crypto faithful.""  He told CoinDesk that he has gone on record as saying that ""enterprise DLT [distributed ledger technology] is blockchain in name only ... so some crypto faithful may agree on that.""  Roubini concluded by saying:  ""But in my opinion, public decentralized trustless blockchain is a pipe dream ... so we disagree on 99% of [the] substance.""

Chairwoman Elvira Nabiullina told a student conference that, while such a project ""cannot be realized immediately,"" various central banks, including Bank of Russia, are investigating the possibility, TASS reported Saturday.  Key to the utility of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), she said, is that the technology must ensure ""reliability and continuity."" ""Technologies must be mature, including technologies of distributed registries,"" Nabiullina said.  Another question is whether citizens are ready to leave cash behind.  According to Nabiullina:  ""It will be more convenient, it is electronic money for people, for citizens. Are we ready, as a society, to refuse cash?""  While some nations have become almost cash-free, others are still fond of physical money, she said – not so much for illicit reasons, but because they value privacy and anonymity.  She finished with some advice to the central bank's researchers, saying they should compare the advantages of CBDCs over other methods, such as fast bank payments.  With something of a tradition of being crypto-skeptical, Russian authorities have softened towards the tech more recently.  Just last month, Nabiullina said that the central bank would consider the use of a gold-backed cryptocurrency to facilitate international settlements.  Also reported by Tass, she said at the time that the Bank of Russia would review a proposal for the development of the cryptocurrency. Nabiullina added, however, that fiat currency settlement systems within the Eurasian Economic Union are improving and already have “good dynamics.”  The Duma, Russia's lower legislative house, is also moving towards passing cryptocurrency legislation, although a projected completion timeline of this spring session is looking unlikely to be met.

Some startups have been waiting at least a year, with a few standing by for as many as 14 months, without seeing any movement from FINRA, three of the sources said.  Several industry members believe the regulators have set an unofficial moratorium on these approvals. Among this group, some think that FINRA is waiting for clear guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on how cryptocurrencies are to be treated under securities laws. Others are firmly convinced the SEC has explicitly told FINRA to hold off.  Still, others said the delays are not a sign of reluctance on the regulators’ part, but are likely unavoidable, and stem from the newness of this asset class. Either way, the result is that a few dozen companies are waiting in regulatory limbo, despite efforts to launch regulated blockchain products in the U.S.  FINRA director of media relations Ray Pellecchia said in response to our inquiry:  “Membership applications from firms proposing to engage in digital asset businesses present new, complex issues and we are in the process of working through them.""  The SEC did not respond to multiple requests for comment.  To be sure, the SEC has been actively engaged with the industry, with both commissioners and staff members repeatedly asking for input on various issues ranging from custody to market manipulation from the crypto community.  Still, nine individuals who spoke to CoinDesk on condition of anonymity to avoid jeopardizing their relationships with the SEC said that either FINRA or the SEC has been stonewalling company approvals.  These individuals include legal representatives of startups trying to acquire these approvals, employees of companies which interact directly with the SEC and other groups which conduct business with these firms.  Lay of the land  The crypto industry is still young, with a limited number of regulated financial products. Startups are looking to change that, by registering as broker-dealers to offer some form of tokenized securities to U.S. customers.  First, though, these companies must pass the gauntlet of regulators.  FINRA is a not-for-profit private organization which approves broker-dealers and licenses individuals to represent these firms. As an SRO, it is itself overseen by the SEC, the nation’s federal securities regulator.  By extension, FINRA also acts as a gatekeeper for qualified custodians and alternative trading systems (ATS), as companies hoping to become either must usually first secure a broker-dealer approval.  Broker-dealers in the U.S are able to buy and sell securities, both for themselves and for their clients. Qualified custodians are entities that safeguard these assets, while ATSs facilitate the trades.  Technically, FINRA only approves broker-dealers, not qualified custodians. However, companies are required to be a registered broker-dealer before they can apply for the latter registration, and while FINRA oversees the governance of ATSs, these entities must register with the SEC – which may publish the registration application for a public comment period before the companies can begin operations.  Crypto exchanges such as Coinbase have previously been interested in launching ATSs to list security tokens (or at least tokens that are explicitly securities) for clients.  Similarly, exchanges may look to become qualified custodians to store crypto assets on behalf of institutional investors, who are neither allowed to handle custody themselves nor inclined to deal with cryptographic private keys. Coinbase, Gemini and BitGo are regulated qualified custodians in the U.S. However, Coinbase and Gemini are licensed through the New York Department of Financial Services and BitGo is licensed through the South Dakota Division of Banking, meaning none of these firms went through FINRA.  As with ATSs, startups are hoping to hold security tokens or tokenized securities for institutional clients by becoming qualified custodians.  But even the prerequisite broker-dealer approvals has been elusive for them.  Approval moratorium?  One lawyer whose client has gone back and forth with the SEC and FINRA called the situation “frustrating,” as the holdup essentially prevents companies looking to conduct business in accordance with U.S. regulations from doing so.  To add insult to injury, the lawyer noted, the SEC has frequently expressed concerns with market manipulation and other fraudulent actions in the crypto space.  ""On the one hand, you have the SEC complaining that there’s all this market manipulation and bad actors, but [on the other] they won’t let good actors come in and clean things up,"" this person told CoinDesk, adding:  “We’re at a stage where we’ve provided absolutely everything we can … they’re not requesting anything else from us. They’re just saying they can’t approve because they’re uncomfortable with this asset class.""  The client company is now looking to conduct business outside the U.S. “It’s really sad, we’ve always prided ourselves [on operating within U.S. regulations],” the lawyer said. “[But] if we have to exclude U.S. citizens and U.S. companies and share our skills abroad, then that’s what we’ll do.”  This last point has been echoed by startups for months now – last September, ConsenSys’ Joyce Lai warned a group of lawmakers that other jurisdictions may be more attractive than the U.S. due to clearer regulatory statutes.  Lai told CoinDesk that regulatory inaction can prevent startups from getting off the ground.  “Regulatory clarification, or a lack thereof, is a huge hindrance that can weigh heavy on the minds (and potential purse strings) of founders,” she said in an interview last week.  Who’s the boss?  Though it is possible that FINRA is declining to approve most broker-dealers right now of its own volition, several individuals told CoinDesk that they believe the SRO is acting at the SEC’s request.  Legally, the SEC has the authority to reject any rules FINRA proposes, though the latter is usually allowed to operate autonomously, said Justin D’Elia, a partner at Duane Morris LLP.  Another attorney who spoke to CoinDesk was under the impression that FINRA was specifically waiting for guidance from the SEC. “The SEC sets the tone,” this person said.  The regulator has published or issued guidance in the form of speeches and a framework outlining how it would apply securities laws to tokens. However, to date, none of the issued statements have been legally binding, and some are even contradictory.  A senior executive at a firm that was not directly affected by the delays said he works with several companies that are.  “They’re filing as they’re supposed to and just getting stuck, endlessly, it seems,” this executive said. Like others, this person placed the ball in the SEC’s court, saying:  ""A lot of times FINRA are the people in the system that are slowing things down but in this case what I've heard is that FINRA is waiting for clarity from the SEC so they can move some of these things forward and they’re actually being quite cooperative on working with people.""  One consideration that may give the SEC and FINRA pause is that a blockchain platform allows anyone to trade private placement securities that in the past would only be accessible to a select group of accredited investors.  “We’re blurring the lines now between what was a private non-traded instrument and a digital security,” said an executive at another firm.  However, another attorney in the crypto industry said applicants who plan to strictly deal with securities or would interact with tokens which are clearly not securities should be easy to approve or disapprove.  ""It’s difficult to understand why ATS applications shouldn’t be approved if they are truly only transacting with something that is a security and it’s difficult to understand what FINRA’s jurisdiction, if any, over non-security assets should be so I’m hoping to see more clarity,” this lawyer said.  Uncharted waters  A few companies have managed to secure approvals, leading some to doubt that there is a moratorium. Another interpretation is that the slowness at FINRA could simply stem from the unique issues digital assets present regulators.  Juan Hernandez, CEO and founder of securities trading platform OpenFinance, told CoinDesk that FINRA has been slow, but that this did not necessarily indicate that there was any sort of order preventing approvals.  OpenFinance  , tZERO, SharesPost and Templum Markets are ATSs that received approval to list digital assets last year – meaning they would have received their approvals while other companies were still waiting. These firms have already conducted some initial security token transactions.  SeedInvest, an equity crowdfunding platform acquired by crypto startup Circle last year, is also an ATS, though the platform cannot list cryptocurrencies for trading at this time, including security tokens.  Hernandez told CoinDesk that FINRA has “been slow to push forward a couple filings but … they did allow [SeedInvest] to push forward with the caveat that they need to do additional filings to be able to transact with digital securities.”  This is not unusual. OpenFinance has already undergone the same process, Hernandez explained, saying:  “But that’s the process we went through last year, we had to do additional filings [specifically] to be able to transact with digital securities.”  Under the regulations and operating procedures for FINRA and the SEC, even if a company is allowed to offer certain securities for trading when its ATS application is approved, there are limits. In other words, a company cannot offer every possible type of security for trading after receiving the ATS license.  Tokenized securities have essentially become a new category of potential offerings, joining bonds and stocks, for example.  Hernandez characterized the process of securing an ATS, broker-dealer or qualified custodian approval as lengthy, but not insurmountable. “Things take longer but it’s not been a freeze or a stop per se,” he told CoinDesk.  Patience runs thin  D’Elia, a long-time securities lawyer, told CoinDesk that he “wouldn’t be surprised” if some companies had to wait 18 months or more to receive the approvals, simply due to the novel issues presented by blockchain companies.  “You tell me you’ve got a blockchain technology, that’s going to be the underlying technology [to your platform] … that is complex, and that’s something FINRA is going to have more questions about,” he said.  The SRO typically examines the owners of an applicant, the source of its funds, its net capital, its funding, who the client base is, how the applicant will target this client base, and what experience its principals have, D’Elia said.  The fact that much of the advertising from an applicant touching cryptocurrencies is likely to be online is another issue (meaning that a much broader audience would be targeted than is typical), he explained. “I think it makes FINRA a little bit more cautious.”  While FINRA’s guidelines nominally give it a six-month deadline to approve or disapprove an application, the SRO can extend that well beyond this time period, D’Elia said. This deadline is further obscured if any part of the application is incomplete or filled out incorrectly.  Hernandez also noted that even incomplete details on the paperwork might result in delays.  One of the executives who spoke with CoinDesk believes the status quo will have to change soon.  “There’s so much industry pressure mounting, not just from the applicants but from the people who want to do ETFs or the people who want to do ATSs or like the Blockstack Reg A,” he said, concluding:  “All these things, there’s this pressure mounting … I’ve got to believe the [SEC] is going to have no choice but to step up. It’s a question of when, not if, but it’s a very big when.”  FINRA image via Andriy Blokhin / Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/06/17/stonewalled-by-finra-up-to-40-crypto-securities-wait-in-limbo-for-launch,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/721b4205f1504ae1ab950a6aae500849850e0b95-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This is the first payment project built on Neutrino, a bitcoin lightning network client, according to the company announcement.  Additionally, Breez has resolved the issue of how to dispute purchases and receive refunds, “so it’s suitable for every kind of purchase right down to a cup of coffee or paying back a friend,” said company founder Roy Sheinfeld, in a statement.  When a user — whether an individual or a merchant — installs the app, Breez automatically opens a payment channel to the Breez hub, which is connected to other Lightning nodes, allowing users to transact with anyone on the network.  Both parties cryptographically sign an updated balance sheet whenever a transaction is made to reflect the changing amounts of Bitcoin stored in the parties’ respected wallets. When the transaction is finished, the resulting balances are registered on the blockchain. In the event of a dispute, both parties can use the most recently signed balance sheet to recover their share of the wallet.  The project, now in beta, builds on the success of Breez’s open network for Android, which the firm says gained hundreds of users in just two months. The beta for iPhone will initially be running on Apple Developer’s TestFlight, the publishing platform for beta apps. Sheinfeld said developing an iOS product allows the company access to around 98 percent of mobile users worldwide.  This announcement is concurrent with a $500,000 investment from Recruit Strategic Partners and Fulgur Ventures. Breez spokesperson Nishal Ratanji views the investment as validating the company’s vision for a “Lightning Economy,” where transactions happen without the expense and hassle of intermediaries such as banks, credit cards, online payment processors, and other custodians.  “Bitcoin has the potential to make all other mediums of exchange – including crypto and fiat currency – obsolete,” said Sheinfeld. “Unfortunately, until other technologies caught up with it, bitcoin was expensive, cumbersome and difficult to move.”  The company states the additional capital will help develop Breez’s point-of-sale Lightning app used by merchants to accept bitcoin payments. Yuki Tanaka, Vice President at Recruit Strategic Partners and investor in Breez, anticipates ""rapid uptake"" of the POS technology in markets such as Japan.  Breez’ technology has undergone testing in sandboxes and other multi-tiered environments, according to the company.

Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun reports Monday that virus variants known to be linked to Russian hackers have been found on employee computers at the Tokyo-based Coincheck exchange.  Coincheck suffered a breach in January 2018 that resulted in the loss of 500 million NEM tokens worth around $530 million at the time – an amount even bigger than that lost by Mt. Gox.  According to the report, the malware found at the exchange had been emailed to employees and included types called Mokes and Netwire, which allow malicious distributors to gain access to victims' machines and operate them remotely. Mokes apparently first appeared on a Russian bulletin board in 2011, while Netwire has been around for 12 years.  The Coincheck hack has previously been linked with North Korea. In a report last February, South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS) said that phishing scams and other methods had yielded tens of billions of won in customer funds. The country's authorities were said at the same time to be probing whether North Korea was behind the Coincheck attack.  Cybersecuirty firm Group-IB also made the link between the allegedly North Korean state-sponsored hacking team and Coincheck in an October report.  Based on an analysis of the viruses, a U.S. cybersecurity expert told the Ashahi Shimbun that Russian or Eastern European hackers may be linked to the Coincheck attack.

42403017,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAde9hK,1560770158,3 Reasons Bitcoin Is Rallying Above $9K,"Bitcoin rose above $9,000 over the weekend, taking cumulative year-to-date gains to more than 150 percent.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value clocked a 13-month high of $9,391 on Bitstamp on Sunday and was last seen trading at $9,200, representing 22 percent gains on last Monday’s low of $7,524.  Cryptocurrency market experts and investors are associating the sharp price gains seen over the last six days with a number of factors, the most prominent being Facebook’s coming foray into cryptocurrencies.  Facebook to launch 'GlobalCoin'  The social media giant is set to unveil its very own stablecoin, reportedly called GlobalCoin on Tuesday, June 17, with a launch to follow in 2020.  The project has reportedly already secured the backing of over a dozen companies and is seen boosting the pace of widespread cryptocurrency adoption by many including Barry Silbert, the founder and chief executive of Digital Currency Group.  Meanwhile, Spencer Bogart, General Partner at Blockchain Capital, believes Facebook’s crypto effort is among the most bullish external tailwinds for bitcoin in 2019/2020, as it will ease the friction in acquiring digital assets by creating a circular economy.  Further, there is a consensus in the investor community that Facebook’s crypto will create awareness that a private, non-central bank issued currency can exist, leading to increased adoption of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  The hype garnered by GlobalCoin likely put a bid under the cryptocurrency over the weekend. That, however, makes BTC vulnerable to “sell the fact” trading following the expected white paper launch on Tuesday.  Binance.com bars US customers  Binance.com, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by trading volume, updated its terms of use on June 14 to exclude all users in the U.S.  The announcement led to a sharp sell-off in Binance’s very own native asset, Binance Coin (BNB). The price of BNB fell 12.8 percent to 25,209 satoshis (a satoshi being 0.00000001 of a BTC) on Friday, and hit a one-month low of 34,906 satoshis on Sunday.  The slide indicates that investors have rotated money out of BNB and possibly into bitcoin, pushing the top cryptocurrency higher, as discussed by Alex Kruger – a prominent Fundamental & Technical Analyst.  The upcoming litecoin (LTC) halving, set to trigger on August 5, 2019, will cut the reward gained from mining the cryptocurrency by half, meaning LTC will become a more scarce asset overall.  ”Halvings’ as they are known, typically result in an overall boost in value for the crypto markets, as the assets themselves become harder to obtain and therefore increase in value.  Litecoin has already rallied 353 percent this year and may have added fuel to the ongoing bitcoin’s price rally. It is worth noting that litecoin led the broader markets higher in the first quarter, with 100 percent gains over the period.  As noted earlier, bitcoin may see a pullback following Facebook’s announcement on Tuesday. The long duration charts, however, indicate that corrections, if any, could be short-lived.  Weekly and monthly charts  Bitcoin jumped 17.57 percent last week (above left), invalidating the bearish view put forward by the previous week’s close below $8,000.  Further, the 5- and 10-week moving averages are trending north, indicating a bullish setup, while Chaikin money flow is reporting the strongest buying pressure since December with an above-0.32 reading.  The bullish case looks stronger if we take into account the falling channel breakout on the monthly chart (above right).  As a result, BTC could rise to $10,000 over the next few weeks. In the short-term, a price pullback cannot be ruled out.  Daily chart  BTC printed 13-month highs above $9,300 on Sunday but failed to close above $9,097 – the high of the bearish outside reversal candle created on May 30.  Another failure to secure a UTC close above $9,097 may trigger profit taking on long positions, leading to a price pullback to the 200-hour moving average (MA), currently at $8,300.

Co-founder Ryan Singer has stepped away from the company to focus on family priorities.  Cohen is viewed as a pioneer of the decentralized internet for creating the BitTorrent filesharing protocol. In August 2017, he left BitTorrent to found Chia, an alternative to bitcoin created to be a less energy-intensive cryptocurrency.  While the company has stayed largely under the radar since announcing itself, it's backed by some of the most closely watched investors in cryptocurrency.  According to Crunchbase, Greylock Partners, Naval Ravikant and Andreessen Horowitz have all backed the young company, which has raised $3.4 million so far. BitTorrent, is now wholly owned by Justin Sun's Tron, a negotiation that required Cohen, as a major shareholder, to play an active part.  Former CEO Singer confirmed to CoinDesk he's not currently working at Chia. A spokesperson for the company also confirmed the transition, adding that current CFO and general counsel Mitch Edwards will take on existing business development relationships.  According to his LinkedIn page, Edwards has had a long career in technology, including a stint in similar roles at BitTorrent and Core Scientific. He also served for a time as acting CEO of Overstock.com, one of the first well-known companies to accept bitcoin.  Chia describes its cryptocurrency as ""enterprise-grade."" It refers to its consensus model as ""farming"" rather than ""mining,"" in order to distinguish it from more energy intensive forms of securing crypto networks.  Since October, Chia has been testing its approach by running optimization contests with its community and open-sourcing the best implementations. The company initiated its second contest in April.

42403001,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAde9SZ,1560759942,Korean Crypto Exchanges Update Terms to Accept Liability for Hacks,"A number of South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges have been forced to update their terms and conditions to accept liability for potential hacks and service issues.  According to a report by the Yonhap News Agency, South Korea's antitrust watchdog, the Fair Trade Commission, said Monday that five exchanges in total had made the change after it issued a corrective recommendation.  Bithumb, an exchange that has been hacked twice in a year, is included in the five exchanges, the report says. Last June, the platform lost roughly $31 million in cryptocurrencies, and, in May 2019, a possible insider job saw around $20 million in the company's holdings of XRP and EOS disappear.  Previously the exchanges' T&Cs had stated that they would not compensate users if not found to be willfully or grossly negligent.  After it's 2018 hack, Bithumb pledged to refund users that lost cryptos, despite its T&Cs.  In January, only a third of inspected cryptocurrency exchanges got a full pass in a government security audit.  At the time, several government agencies inspected a total of 21 crypto exchanges from September to December 2018, examining 85 different security aspects.

42403011,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAde9YT,1560758439,Crypto's Connection to the Hong Kong Protests,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      “Privacy is dead. Get over it.”  We hear that refrain a lot. So often, in fact, that it has (almost) become accepted wisdom for how the digital age must evolve. Sure, there’s concern about the relentless accumulation of data about our online lives. There are even some legislative efforts to hold it back, most notably in Europe.  But there’s an all-too common perception that such efforts are doomed, that the encroachment into our private lives can’t or shouldn’t be impeded. It’s a view that’s either framed by a glass-half-full position that the benefits of the Fourth Industrial Revolution outweigh the costs of lost privacy, or by its glass-half-empty alternative: that the data machines of our global economy can’t be stopped whether we’d like them to or not.  Yet the irony is that the torrent of information delivered by these machines frequently includes new items that make you stop and question this pervading fatalism. They remind us that lives are at stake, that we must take concrete measures to protect the private realm.  This Twitter post by Quartz reporter Mary Hui was one such item:    There is usually never a line at the train ticketing machines. Judging from an overheard convo, it appears that people are reluctant to use their rechargeable Octopus cards for fear of leaving a paper trail of them having been present at the protest. pic.twitter.com/s1rsgSnCqL        — Mary Hui (@maryhui) June 12, 2019      The setting, of course, is Hong Kong, where hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets last week to protest changes to extradition laws that many believe would open a back-door to mainland Chinese judicial oversight. The behavior shown here reflects fears that Beijing is already, in effect, using a backdoor to surveil and control Hong Kong’s citizens, in this case via payments technology.  On Saturday, Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam announced that the extradition bill would be suspended, according to the New York Times.  Up until now, the Octopus card has been mostly hailed as a success story for the Hong Kong economy. The contactless stored value card, introduced by the Mass Transit Railway system just three months after Chinese sovereignty over the former British colony territory was restored in 1997, has evolved from simply a multi-ride MTR ticket into a widely accepted method of payment around the city. And by reducing the costs that banks impose on credit card payments, it has helped lubricate commerce in Hong Kong.  That was all fine until people began to realize that the Octopus network could also be a state surveillance tool, a concern that was, naturally, heightened by the ongoing encroachment of Chinese governance in Hong Kong’s affairs. So, as outlined in a follow-up report from Hui, many of the protesters resorted to the obscurity of cash-purchased MTR tickets instead of using their card. In fact, as others reported, many also went “dark” on social media, foregoing digital tools that had until recently been viewed as empowering the protest movement.  In a response to Hui’s post, my fellow CoinDesk advisory board member Dovey Wan showed how these actions in Hong Kong must be understood in the context of current digital life on the mainland. There, the pervasive use of mobile payment apps such as Tencent’s WePay and Alibaba’s Alipay has turned China into a virtually cashless society, one that has also given rise to losses of privacy and alternative workarounds to limit that loss:    In mainland cash is almost obsolete, most of economic activities are associated real identities : both Alipay and wechat are under real name system + bio metrics.        many important figures/celebs use others’ payment accounts all the time to keep names untraceable in the system https://t.co/66eWY473X8    — Dovey Wan 🦖 (@DoveyWan) June 13, 2019      Privacy as imperative for human dignity and economics  I’ve written elsewhere about the dangers of cashlessness if digital payment systems don’t respect privacy. What’s at stake is the fungibility of money itself. But this Hong Kong-versus-China story goes to something more fundamental: the protection of human free will, which also happens to matter enormously to the global economy.  A desperate desire to preserve this fundamental right is what drew the masses into the streets last week. They know of the “Black Mirror” implications of China’s “social credit” program for tracking and scoring individuals’ digital activity, which the State Council last week identified as a vital government objective. But while the protesters may not have expressed it this way, they were also fighting to preserve Hong Kong’s vital role in international commerce.  When Deng Xiaoping’s “One Country, Two Systems” principle defined how Hong Kong would maintain its own economic and political administration after the handover, it was an implicit recognition that property rights, freedom of the press and other basic rights were integral to the territory’s economy, which China had a strong interest in sustaining.  Such assurances then became critical to Hong Kong’s continued status as Asia’s financial hub. They meant the world’s banks could maintain their thriving regional headquarters inside the territory’s glittering office towers, allowing it to function as a kind of East-meets-West transition point. Banks and their clients could do business with China, but enjoy Western legal protections. Trade could thrive.  Since then, the formation of special economic zones in booming mainland cities like Shenzhen and Shanghai have drawn banks and other foreign companies into China and have slightly diminished Hong Kong’s clout as a financial hub. Nonetheless, with a trade war growing between the U.S. and China, Hong Kong’s politically and economically liberal status is as important as ever.  This is as much in China’s interest as the West’s. As China asserts its international influence through its massive Belt and Road Initiative, for example, we can assume that companies from that scheme’s 60-plus other countries will resist submitting to Chinese judicial oversight.  Hong Kong’s legal framework, with its proven respect for property rights, offers a compromise. (The territory was deliberately cited as the anchor jurisdiction for the Belt and Road Blockchain Consortium, which Pindar Wong, another CoinDesk advisor, founded to lay out a Belt and Road framework for arbitrating cross-border disputes over smart contracts.)  And while the bill itself has been delayed (but not withdrawn), if hardliners have their way in Hong Kong, it could ultimately set back the initiative and constrain global trade itself.  Hold the line  But let’s bring this all back to human beings, money and technology.  While we can debate, as four Consensus panelists did last month, whether a fundamental human right to transact exists, we can all agree that economic exchange underpins society and that, therefore, hindering it holds us all back. Orwellian digital surveillance is a particularly powerful hindrance. We must resist it.  This is why the pro-privacy principles that underpin early cryptocurrency ideas matter. It’s why coins such as Zcash and Monero, which aim to overcome some of bitcoin’s privacy limitations, are important. And it’s why other new pro-privacy initiatives, such as those enabled by secure multi-party computation, should be encouraged. Its why we should oppose over-reach by regulatory bodies like the Financial Action Task Force.  Above all, it’s why we must support Hong Kong’s protesters.

The company is seeking $4 million in damages, alleging the Poolin co-founders violated their non-compete agreements; The former employees say Bitmain voided the non-compete by failing to pay them on time as agreed.  The case offers a rare window on Bitmain’s inner-workings and employment practices.      Cryptocurrency mining giant Bitmain is locked in a legal battle with three former employees who started a rival mining pool.  Bitmain, the owner of BTC.com, the world’s top bitcoin mining pool by hash rate, is suing the co-founders of Poolin, the seventh-largest pool, for allegedly violating a non-compete agreement – and it's demanding $4.3 million in damages from one of them.  For their part, the three Poolin co-founders say they were no longer bound by the non-compete, since it was Bitmain that invalidated their contracts for failing to pay compensation on time as agreed.  The case offers a rare window on the inner workings and employment practices of Bitmain, one of the blockchain industry’s largest and most powerful companies.  Bitmain makes most of its money from selling mining equipment, according to financials disclosed during the firm’s abortive attempt to go public. But it also operates mining pools, essentially software products miners use to split rewards. This service accounted for $43.2 million of Bitmain’s revenues in the first half of 2018, the most recent period for which data is available, compared to $2.7 billion of hardware sales during the same period.  There are six lawsuits pending in the Beijing Haidian District court. The three Poolin co-founders – CEO Zhibiao Pan; COO Fa Zhu; and CTO Tianzhao Li – each sued Bitmain preemptively, seeking to be released from the non-compete.  Bitmain, in turn, countersued each of them, claiming they caused significant losses to the company after leaving by operating a directly competing pool. Aside from seeking damages, Bitmain asked the court to order the Poolin executives to resume honoring the non-compete agreement.  The dispute has largely escaped public notice, but video footage recently became available of an April 30 hearing where the two sides made their respective cases. The video only showed discussion of the case between Pan and Bitmain. As such, exact details regarding the other two former employees were not clear until now.  The birth of BTC.com  The main dispute in these cases boils down to the roles the three Poolin founders played in Bitmain’s flagship mining pool BTC.com, and the non-compete agreements they signed when they decided to leave Bitmain.  In a WeChat post written by Zhu and published by a Chinese crypto media outlet in January commemorating bitcoin’s 10-year anniversary, he briefly recounted the trio’s work at Bitmain.  Zhu wrote that back in 2015, the three – while still focusing on Bitmain’s original mining pool, Antpool – proposed to launch BTC.com as a parallel service within Bitmain.  The idea was not initially supported by Bitmain, Zhu wrote, and the three had to develop and roll it out on their own using Pan’s own capital at the beginning. In 2016, Pan open-sourced the code of BTC.com, which helped lower the threshold for anyone that’s interested in launching a mining pool business.  The three collaborators left Bitmain around mid-2017. Under the non-compete agreement, Bitmain would pay monthly compensation to Pan after his departure of about $2,780 for 24 months, and in return, prohibit him from specifically operating a bitcoin mining pool. The compensation for the other two under such agreements was not clear from the court video.  After their departure from Bitmain, Pan, Zhu and Li launched Poolin as mining pool for multiple cryptocurrency assets in November 2017. They didn’t launch a pool service for bitcoin until July 2018, when they mined Poolin’s first block of the largest cryptocurrency by market cap.  It has since grown into one of the largest bitcoin mining pools. Based on facts agreed on by both sides of the case and presented to the court, as of Feb. 14, Poolin was the third biggest operation by hash rate in the world, after BTC.com and AntPool. All told, miners connected to Poolin had mined 26,825 bitcoin, worth $220 million at today’s prices.  Notably, Poolin’s share of the hash rate has dropped since then to about 8.2 percent, and its rank has fallen to No. 7, based on the current distribution of bitcoin’s network computation.  Bitmain cries foul  Subsequently, Bitmain alleged that such conduct violated the non-compete agreement, and demanded that Pan return all the paid compensation, as well as a fine of $667,000 for reneging.  Further, Bitmain’s lawyers argued at the hearing that the revenues Poolin generated from mining the 26,825 bitcoin should be considered a profit made by violating the agreement, which should be paid back as a loss to Bitmain.  “Based on the agreement, if it’s difficult to calculate all the direct and indirect loss [for Bitmain due to Poolin’s violation], then the loss should be calculated based on the profits made by the violating party,” one of the lawyers said.  “As of Feb. 14, the total profits for Poolin would be 26,825 bitcoin times 4 percent, which was their handling fee, and times bitcoin’s price at the time, which was 24,518 yuan [$3,500],” the lawyer argued.  That, added to the alleged fine, would amount to more than 30 million yuan, or about $4.3 million.  Poolin pushes back  But lawyers representing the Poolin founders argued to the court that Pan was not obligated to honor the agreement and thus should not be ordered to pay damages.  Pan’s lawyers said in the hearing that Bitmain failed to pay Pan the agreed-upon compensation on time, citing lines from the agreement that if Party A (Bitmain) did not pay the compensation within a month since Party B (Pan)’s departure, it would mean Party A voided its obligation.  Further, Pan’s lawyers argued the transaction fee Poolin received doesn’t necessarily translate to profits of the company because until the date of the hearing, the firm had not turned a profit. In addition, the fact that Poolin successfully mined 26,825 bitcoin also does not necessarily mean it would be a loss for BTC.com, the lawyer said.  “There are a lot more bitcoin mining pools in this network. It’s not just Poolin v.s. BTC.com. Even if Poolin didn’t operate its bitcoin mining pool, it does not necessarily mean Bitmain will be able to mine those coins.” the lawyer argued.  So far, it’s not yet clear from the public record whether the court has made a judgment or when it will. The judge asked at the end of the hearing if there was a way for the two parties to settle the case. Lawyers from Bitmain declined to discuss that at the court and suggested waiting until after the hearing adjourned.  Bitmain declined to comment or provide further clarification on the status of the cases. Poolin executives did not respond to CoinDesk's inquiries by press time.  This is not the first time Bitmain has had a legal dispute with former senior executives. In 2017, it sued Zuoxing Yang, a former Bitmain chip design director who left to launch Bitewei, a rival mining equipment manufacturer, over patent rights infringement.  Bitmain initially demanded damages of 26 billion yuan, or $3.8 billion, but later reduced the claim to $380,000. In 2018, the court in Xinjiang that oversaw the case dismissed Bitmain’s complaint after Yang successfully revoked Bitmain’s patent over the technology in dispute.
