13195820,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=536759,1686094200,"Ripple CEO Blasts SEC Chair For Anti-Innovation Stance, XRP Bulls Remain Optimistic","In a scathing critique of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) recent actions against the cryptocurrency industry, Ripple Chair Executive Officer (CEO) Brad Garlinghouse has accused the SEC Chair Gary Gensler of “hypocrisy” and “desperation”. In a statement released on Twitter, Garlinghouse called Gensler’s claims to be “pro-innovation” laughable, arguing that the agency’s recent lawsuits against Ripple and other companies are simply a distraction from their internal struggles. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) Rollercoaster Ride: Is $23,000 The End Of The Line? Ripple CEO Claps Back At SEC Chair Garlinghouse went on to criticize Gensler as an “unelected bureaucrat” who is flailing to mask the fact that he and his agency lack the power they so desperately crave. He suggested that the SEC’s crackdown on the crypto industry is misguided and ultimately harmful to innovation. Furthermore, Ripple CEO Garlinghouse criticizes Gensler for trying to exert power that he doesn’t possess and suggests that the agency’s actions are ultimately futile. On the same note, according to Yassin Mobarak, founder of venture capital firm Dizer Capital, the SEC’s aggressive approach may be an attempt to prevent a precedent-setting ruling against them in the Ripple case. Mobarak suggests that the SEC may be expediting their attack plans to isolate any potential losses in the Ripple case and claim that they are specific to the facts and circumstances of that case, rather than applicable to the entire cryptocurrency industry. This would enable the SEC to avoid setting a precedent that could have negative implications for the industry as a whole. These comments reflect the growing tension between the SEC and the cryptocurrency industry, with many companies feeling unfairly targeted by the agency’s regulatory actions. The recent lawsuits against Ripple, Coinbase, and Binance have raised questions about the legitimacy of the SEC’s claims and the impact of their actions on the wider industry. XRP Price Shows Resilience Amid Regulatory Uncertainty XRP has had a tumultuous few weeks as increased regulatory scrutiny has put pressure on the entire crypto industry. After reaching a key level of $0.500 on May 30, XRP lost some of its momentum amid uncertainty about the future of the industry. However, the market has shown resilience, and XRP has managed to breach the $0.500 level once again. As of the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.5285, up 3% in the last 24 hours. This suggests that investors remain optimistic about the long-term prospects of the cryptocurrency, despite the challenges posed by regulatory uncertainty. What’s more, according to the crypto analyst Egrag Crypto, XRP is nearing what he calls the “twilight zone” with a ‘W’ formation, which has several measured targets. The non-logarithmic ‘W’ formation measured target is between $0.75-$0.85 cents, while the logarithmic ‘W’ formation measured target is between $1.00-$1.20. Additionally, the symmetrical triangle full send break-out target is around $5.5, while the Fib 1.618 target is at $6.4, which would represent an uptrend of over 1000% Related Reading: Cardano Founder Unveils SEC Motivation For Suing Binance However, despite these potential price targets, Egrag Crypto also warns of an ultimate shakeout, which could potentially retest the lows seen in June.

13195262,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=536755,1686092431,"Former Twitter CEO Claims Ethereum Is A Security, Will This Affect Prices?","Jack Dorsey, the former CEO of Twitter, while replying to a comment on June 6, alleged that Ethereum (ETH), the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange, is a security under United States laws. This controversially implies that holders of ETH should, as directed by law, comply with rules enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Dorsey Claims Ethereum Is A Security Dorsey, a known Bitcoin supporter and the CEO of Square Inc, a financial service company that owns Cash App, has been vocal about BTC’s underlying technology. In his assessment, Dorsey thinks Bitcoin can change how money is exchanged. Amid this, Bitcoin, as a network and a payment solution, can help create a more equitable financial system. Square is already invested in Bitcoin. On the other hand, Cash App continues to process billions worth of BTC transactions. SEC officials and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have been recorded saying BTC, the native currency of the Bitcoin network, is a commodity and not an investment contract. Related Reading: Cardano Founder Unveils SEC Motivation For Suing Binance The SEC and CFTC are two of the leading regulators in the United States tasked with regulating the securities and derivatives markets. However, considering their broad scopes, their jurisdictions can overlap. Still, their endorsement of Bitcoin as a commodity can further drive adoption and boost liquidity. Dorsey’s statement comes as a regulatory storm in recent days threatens to draw ETH into the mix for several reasons. The SEC’s chair, Gary Gensler, during a congressional hearing in early February specified that tokens like Ethereum are sold as investments, subsequently generating profits solely from the efforts of others. Therefore, in the agency’s perception, it may be an investment contract or security subject to federal securities law. All the same, the commission, he added, was reviewing the crypto markets, including those of Bitcoin and Ethereum, to ensure they are efficient and fair. While before the House Financial Services Committee in mid-April, Gensler also failed to clarify whether ETH was a security or a commodity. ETH Remains Sensitive To Regulatory Developments The SEC has brought enforcement actions against several companies that mint tokens on the Ethereum platform. Leading influencers have also been accused by the SEC of promoting tokens they claim are registered securities. Despite this, the SEC is yet to issue an official statement on the classification of this cryptocurrency. At the end, the commission could choose not to regulate ETH as a security after it has reviewed all relevant factors. Related Reading: Coinbase Caught In SEC Legal Crossfire, COIN Price Suffers With the regulator calling tokens of competing smart contract platforms like Cardano and Algorand as securities, ETH prices sold off on June 5 only to reverse losses today. Whether the dump of June 5 was an overreaction from the crypto market is yet to be seen. What’s clear is that ETH remains sensitive to regulatory actions, and bulls have since failed to break above 2023 highs of $2,100.

42410464,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdWwxu,1686091681,Atomic Wallet Was Breached by North Korean Hackers: Elliptic,"Atomic Wallet users might have fallen victim to Lazarus, the infamous North Korean hacking group, said blockchain intelligence firm Elliptic in a blog post on Tuesday.  Early Saturday morning, the team behind Atomic, a non-custodial crypto wallet, announced that some users were compromised and lost the funds from their wallets. According to the company, the number of incidents did not exceed 1% of ""monthly active users."" The announcement followed multiple reports on Reddit from users complaining their wallets had been drained.  ZachXBT, a pseudonymous blockchain sleuth, estimated that around $35 million in various cryptocurrencies had been stolen, including bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), tether (USDT), dogecoin (DOGE), litecoin (LTC), BNB coin (BNB), polygon (MATIC) and Tron-based USDT.  The stolen crypto has been funneled to a mixer called Sindbad.io, Elliptic wrote. This mixer, which Elliptic believes is a successor of the previously sanctioned mixer Blender.io, has been often used to launder money from other hacks attributed to Lazarus, and the usage pattern is the same, Elliptic said. The firm also found connections between the wallets containing the loot from Atomic and some of the Lazarus hacks, the blog post reads.  Read more: Least Authority Discloses Security Risks in Atomic Wallet  What was hacked  Last year, security audit company Least Authority warned in a blog post that Atomic Wallet may have been vulnerable to breaches. According to Least Authority, issues included the way Atomic implemented cryptography, that it did not adhere to the best practices for wallet design, a lack of robust project documentation and incorrect use of Electron, a framework for building desktop applications. The firm has since taken down the post.  According to Dyma Budorin, CEO of blockchain security firm Hacken, there are several possible explanations for how the hack happened. One reason could be that Atomic's way to generate recovery phrases (the so-called seed phrases) for wallets did not produce sufficiently random sequences of words, making it easier for hackers to brute-force wallets, Budorin told CoinDesk.  Non-custodial wallets like Atomic allow users to keep their crypto autonomously, without trusting a centralized company, which means if users lose a device or password for their wallet they can only recover funds using the seed phrase. However, anyone who has access to the seed phrase can duplicate the wallet and steal the funds.  Another hypothesis is that hackers could have mathematically derived the users’ private keys from the transactions data visible on the bitcoin blockchain. This kind of attack was described in a freshly published paper by researchers at the University of California, San Diego. Hacken also detected that the Android version of Atomic “relied on an outdated and vulnerable dependency” when signing transactions, Budorin said.  Other possibilities include a supply chain attack on the wallet manufacturer, a hack of Atomic’s website or the intentional or unintentional broadcasting of users’ private keys to Atomic’s centralized server, according to Hacken.  According to ZachXBT, over $1 million in funds stolen from a single have been successfully recovered by Jito Labs, a Solana blockchain scaling startup.  ""This hack is very vocal, highlighting the core problems in crypto wallets. The wallets don't pay enough attention to building a strong architecture with security best practices implemented,"" Budorin added.  Atomic CEO Konstantin Gladych told CoinDesk he couldn’t comment on the possible reason for the hack.  The team is now collecting data from affected users and passing it to the blockchain analysis firms like Chainalysis, Crystal and Elliptic, he said, adding that part of the funds landed on exchanges and has been blocked.  “The attack was definitely organized by a team of professional hackers. They’re using scripts, splitting of the funds, mixers, etc.,” Gladych said.  UPDATE (June 6, 2023, 21:30 UTC): Adds comment from Atomic CEO Konstantin Gladych.

The recent blow to the crypto market caused by the SEC suing Binance has further impacted the altcoin’s performance. In the past 24 hours, AAVE has lost 3% of its value, and on the weekly chart, the coin has seen a significant plunge of nearly 12%. Technical indicators suggest the presence of considerable bearish pressure, with both demand and accumulation declining. Related Reading: Dogecoin Plunges 7% As Whales Make Large Moves With Bitcoin also experiencing a drop to the $25,000 zone, most altcoins have exhibited similar price actions. AAVE has struggled to maintain its price above a crucial support level, and as selling pressure has intensified, it has dipped below that level. The market capitalization of AAVE has also depreciated, indicating that sellers currently hold control over the price at this time. Aave Price Analysis: One-Day Chart As of the time of writing, Aave is trading at $61. The bulls encountered resistance at the $62 level as the broader market showed signs of weakness in recent days. The altcoin’s resistance levels are at $61.30 and $62.80. If the price breaks above $62.80, it could potentially reach the $65 price level. However, the bears have exerted influence, which may cause Aave to approach its support line at $59. If unable to stay above this support, the coin could drop to $57 and potentially even $51, serving as short-selling targets for traders. The trading volume for Aave in the last session has remained low, indicating a lack of strong buying pressure. Technical Analysis Aave has been facing challenges in generating demand, as reflected in its chart. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates that sellers have outnumbered buyers in the market, with the RSI remaining below the half-line. In order for buying strength to persist, the price needs to surpass overhead resistance levels. Additionally, Aave has dropped below the 20-Simple Moving Average line, suggesting that sellers have been driving the price momentum in the market. These factors indicate the prevailing bearish sentiment surrounding Aave’s performance. Confirming the bearish sentiment on the chart, Aave has generated sell signals on the one-day chart, aligning with other indicators. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), which illustrates price momentum and potential reversals, has formed red histograms, indicating sell signals for the altcoin.

While mixers and blenders aim to provide privacy for legitimate crypto users, they are also commonly abused by hackers and scammers to hide stolen funds. Elliptic Reveals Laundering Connected To Atomic Wallet Hack Last week, hackers breached the non-custodial decentralized wallet, Atomic Wallet, and made off with over $35 million in various crypto assets from unsuspecting users. Related Reading: Not Immune To FUD? Binance Sees $1.5 Billion In Outflows In 24 Hours The hackers didn’t stop there, though. In an attempt to hide their tracks, they moved the stolen funds through a crypto-mixing service to obscure the source of the money. In a tweet recently made by Elliptic, the company’s investigations team revealed that it had tracked funds stolen in the attack to Sinbad.io, a mixer that has been linked to the nefarious Lazarus Group of North Korea. According to the investigation, the stolen assets were swapped to Bitcoin and moved through the mixer. Unfortunately, the exact amount that was delivered to the mixer is still unknown, and Elliptic did not specify in the tweet. Total market cap recovers above $1.08 trillion | Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on TradingView.com The Aftermath Of The Hack Last week, Atomic Wallet became the latest crypto company to fall victim to a hack and have its security breached. During the weekend, users began flooding Twitter with complaints that digital assets such as Tether’s USDT, Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA), and Dogecoin (DOGE) had mysteriously vanished from their wallets. Some customers have even reported that they have completely lost all of their cryptocurrency holdings. Atomic Wallet also confirmed reports of the compromised wallets on its platform. While the details of how the hack happened weren’t released, it is highly likely to be a direct phishing attack. The company added that less than 1% of its monthly users were impacted by the hack. However, some users have claimed otherwise as the non-custodial decentralized wallet boasts of 5 million users. Related Reading: Bitcoin Slips Below $26,000, Triggers Over $300 Million In Liquidations The investigations into the Atomic Wallet hack are ongoing as authorities work to track down the stolen funds. Unfortunately, cryptocurrencies stolen in hacks are difficult to trace once they’ve been moved around. There is always a possibility that some or even all of the funds may never be retrieved due to the anonymous nature of cryptocurrency. The hack serves as an important reminder that security remains the most important element of investing in crypto, as user funds are a prime target for cybercriminals looking to make a quick buck.

42410446,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdWw3h,1686086344,SEC's Latest Crackdown Could Drive Crypto Firms Out of the U.S.,"Some industry experts say the SEC’s recent actions against U.S.-based Coinbase and Cayman Islands-based Binance could be a net positive for companies operating in the U.S, given the regulatory clarity they could help bring in the long run. In the short to medium term, however, these actions could force these firms to focus their efforts elsewhere.  “Regulatory pressure does create an incentive for exchanges to move overseas; for the digital asset industry specifically, it’s a much easier shift because there are no factories to move,” said Jason Allegrante, Chief Legal and Compliance Officer at infrastructure firm Fireblocks.  Coinbase recently announced it received a license to offer its services in Bermuda, where it reportedly plans to set up a crypto-trading platform outside of the U.S. The exchange is also doubling down on its operations in Canada, which has tightened its regulations for crypto firms but allowed Coinbase to sign an enhanced Pre-Registration Undertaking, signaling its intent to comply with the coming new regulatory framework.  “I suspect we will see more and more moves like this,” Andrew Lawrence, co-founder and CEO of Censo Inc., an on-chain custody solution said. “Yes, the U.S. is the biggest market, but people who are building in the crypto industry are doing so not because of the size of the market now, but because of the size of the market in the future and people are seeing that this future is not looking good in the United States.”  Ben Caselin, Vice President & Chief Strategy Officer at centralized crypto exchange MaskEX, agreed. “All eyes are now set on other jurisdictions,” he said. “This is not the best time for crypto startups in the U.S. Larger players such as Coinbase are able and should engage the regulator to come to solutions, but entrepreneurs and small businesses in crypto are probably better off in other jurisdictions.”  For his part, SEC chief Gary Gensler signaled he’s not too worried about the prospect of crypto firms leaving the U.S. On Tuesday he told Bloomberg TV that “we don’t need more digital currency… we already have digital currency, it’s called the U.S. dollar.”  Fireblocks’ Allegrante said even though the U.S. might be the most profitable market for some exchanges, that may not be reason enough for them to focus all their efforts there. “When a company publicly announces plans to establish exchange operations outside of the United States, you can assume that there are plans in place to shift that balance over time,” Allegrante said about Coinbase.  At the same time, the U.S. market won’t be so easy to ignore.  “The U.S. market was supposed to deliver the next major wave of crypto interest, so it will be hard to completely abandon it,” Edward Moya, senior analyst at foreign exchange Oanda, said.  Even after the SEC warned Coinbase about law enforcement action against the exchange in March, CEO Brian Armstrong said that the exchange remains “100% committed to the U.S.” and in response to the lawsuit, Coinbase said it will continue to dedicate its efforts to operating in the U.S.  Mark Palmer of brokerage firm Berenberg Capital Markets said the battle may be just beginning.  “The exchanges, led by Coinbase, will likely take their fight to the courts while hoping that the political winds change in the U.S. such that more crypto-friendly leaders would be in charge,” Palmer noted.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/06/06/secs-latest-crackdown-could-drive-crypto-firms-out-of-the-us,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ac7442adfcb8fc925aa2d91cdc3f0123be44a0df-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Supply In Profit Shrunk Down To 62.5% Following The Price Plunge According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, a further 1.26 million coins were lost after the latest price plummet. The relevant indicator is the “percent supply in profit,” which measures the percentage of the total circulating Bitcoin supply currently being held at a profit. The metric calculates this value by going through the on-chain history of all the coins on the network to see what price they were last moved at. If the previous selling price for any coin was less than the current spot value of the asset, then that specific coin is counted inside the profit supply. The counterpart indicator for the percent supply in profit is the “percent supply in loss,” which naturally tracks the loss of supply. This metric’s value can be found by subtracting the percent supply in profit from 100. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin percent supply in profit over the last couple of days: The value of the metric seems to have observed some decline recently | Source: Glassnode on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin percent supply in profit saw a massive plunge as the crash in the cryptocurrency from the $27,300 mark to the $25,800 level took place. The impetus behind this price plunge was the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) suing the cryptocurrency exchange Binance and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, over alleged fraud. Though even though the price saw a 5.8% plunge during this crash, the percentage of the total circulating Bitcoin supply that was sent into a state of loss measured to around 6.5%. Related Reading: Dogecoin Plunges 7% As Whales Make Large Moves The analytics firm also explained the reason behind this discrepancy; the price range that the asset had previously been trading in was host to many investors’ cost basis (that is, the acquisition/buying price). Looks like the prices that BTC had been trading at before were the center of the largest demand profile | Source: Glassnode on Twitter Since a relatively high percentage of the supply had been bought at those levels, it makes sense that a sharp price move below it would send a significant number of coins into a loss. When Bitcoin had been trading around the $25,800 level, the percent supply in profit had dropped to just 62.5%, while preceding the crash, the indicator had a value of about 69%. This would imply that 37.5% of the supply had been lost after the plunge. Related Reading: Bitcoin Slips Below $26,000, Triggers Over $300 Million In Liquidations Since Glassnode posted the chart, however, the cryptocurrency has recovered, pushing back above the $26,000 level.

A court filing made in the D.C. District Court asks for approval to freeze assets tied to BAM Management US Holdings and BAM Trading Services, the holding and operating firms for Binance.US. The SEC sued Binance.US, Binance Global and Binance founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao on Monday, alleging a host of compliance and control failures, including claims that companies tied to Zhao were able to secretly access funds belonging to Binance.US customers.  ""The SEC respectfully submits that this relief is necessary on an expedited basis to ensure the safety of customer assets and prevent the dissipation of available assets for any judgment, given the Defendants’ years of violative conduct, disregard of the laws of the United States, evasion of regulatory oversight, and open questions about various financial transfers and the custody and control of Customer Assets – including by Defendants who claim they are not subject to the Court’s jurisdiction – as described in the Complaint, Memorandum of Law, and supporting materials,"" an SEC filing said.  Another filing seeks an order to ""show cause why a preliminary injunction should not be granted,"" ""an order directing defendants to repatriate assets held for the benefit of BAM customers,"" ""an order prohibiting the destruction of records by the defendants"" and a host of others.

In a tweet late Tuesday, Binance.US said ""user assets remain safe and secure,"" and said its attorneys have provided information to the SEC addressing fund safety concerns.  In a memorandum of law filed shortly after the application for a temporary restraining order, the SEC reiterated many of its arguments from its original lawsuit, including that Binance had access to Binance.US funds and that Binance and founder Zhao had expressed a desire to evade U.S. regulators.  ""Even to the extent they retain control over Binance.US Platform customers’ crypto assets, BAM Trading’s recent assertions raise concerns about its ability to properly custody them. BAM Trading has operated the Binance.US Platform for over 3.5 years, yet it only implemented formal policies for handling crypto assets last month (a timing that corresponds to when the SEC was asking about precisely those practices),"" the filing said.  Monday's filing hinted at the temporary restraining order request, with the SEC noting that it would request preliminary injunctive relief which could include asset freezes and ""a verified accounting.""  In its lawsuit Monday, the SEC alleged that Binance had allowed two companies tied to CZ, Sigma Chain and Merit Peak, to access ""billions of U.S. dollars"" of customer funds held by BAM Trading.  In a statement in response to the initial suit, Binance said that user funds on Binance.US were never at risk.

BTC could benefit from investors ditching altcoins after the SEC deemed multiple tokens unregistered securities in lawsuits against Binance, Coinbase, one analyst said.  Cryptocurrency prices recovered on Tuesday with bitcoin (BTC) leading the charge a day after a mass sell-off triggered by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) suing Binance, and despite a second suit against Binance rival Coinbase.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization recently soared above $27,000, up almost 6% over the past 24 hours. On Monday, BTC fell near $25,400 as investors, already skittish from months of digital asset debacles, abandoned crypto after the SEC said Binance had violated securities law.  The broader crypto market also regained ground since Monday, albeit somewhat less than BTC. ETH, the second largest crypto by market value, was recently changing hands at slightly below $1,900, up 4.5% from Monday, same time. ADA and SOL, the tokens of the smart contract platforms Cardano and Solana, recently rose more than 1% a day after plunging more than 8% and 10%, respectively. Binance’s BNB native token was also in positive territory, while Polygon’s MATIC was down 1%. The SEC listed those tokens and nine others as unregistered securities in the two lawsuits.  The Coindesk Market Index (CMI), which tracks the price of a basket of tokens, recently rose 4.5%.

Liquidity could consolidate further towards Coinbase and Kraken, but the market should not crash 5% on these developments.”  And in another market report, senior market analyst Edward Moya at trading platform Oanda, wrote that the SEC crackdown on altcoins could even benefit bitcoin.  “​​Bitcoin is becoming an interesting trade here as many crypto investors might just decide to give up on most altcoins and stick with what has worked best since cryptos were created,” Moya wrote. “With the SEC naming Solana, Polygon, Cardano, and BNB as securities, some traders might decide to abandon those positions on any major exchange, switch the position to a cold wallet, or just close out their position and reopen a bitcoin one.”  Read more: Why Isn’t Bitcoin Falling More?

The Dow ( DJI ) ended as the worst performer, lagging behind Wall Street's other two major indexes. The blue-chip gauge rose 0.03% to settle at 33,573.28 points. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( COMP.IND ) added 0.36% to close at 13,276.42 points. Gains were capped by continued weakness in shares of Apple ( AAPL ) as investors digested the implications of the iPhone-maker's highly priced new mixed-reality headset. The S&P 500 ( SP500 ) ended 0.24% higher at 4,283.85 points. The benchmark index retreated further from a key level at 4,292.44 points, after having crossed it several times on Monday. If it closes above that level, it would mark a more than 20% gain from its October 2022 closing low and an exit from its longest bear-market run since 1948. Seven of the 11 S&P sectors closed in positive territory, led by an outsized +1% gain in Financials on the back of strength in regional bank stocks. The SPDR Regional Bank ETF ( KRE ) and the Invesco KBW Regional Bank ETF ( KBWR ) added more than 5% each, while Comerica ( CMA ) and Zions Bancorporation ( ZION ) ended among the top S&P 500 ( SP500 ) percentage gainers. ""With the debt ceiling deal and the OPEC meeting in the market's rearview mirror, we could be heading into a sleepy period this summer,"" Andrew Hecht, investing group leader of Hecht Commodity Report , told Seeking Alpha. The economic calendar was empty, and the Federal Reserve is in its blackout period ahead of its monetary policy committee meeting from June 13 to 14. According to the CME FedWatch tool, markets are seeing a solid ~81% chance of no rate hike next week, followed by a +54% probability of a 25 basis point bump in July. ""The Fed is likely to pause interest rate hikes to allow the tightening to filter through the economy. However, the recent employment data does not preclude another 25 basis point Fed Funds Rate increase. While it is tempting to embrace calm conditions, traders and investors should remain vigilant as the geopolitical landscape continues to threaten surprises that could cause sudden price shocks,"" Hecht added. Also in focus on Tuesday were cryptocurrencies, after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued crypto exchange Coinbase ( COIN ), which tumbled more than 12%. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and ethereum ( ETH-USD ) initially fell, but then reversed course and marched higher. Treasury yields were mixed. The longer-end 10-year yield ( US10Y ) was down 1 basis point to 3.68% while the more rate-sensitive 2-year yield ( US2Y ) was up 3 basis points to 4.51%. The dollar index ( DXY ) was up 0.15% to 104.16. Turning to active stocks, chipmakers were in focus after reports that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ( TSM ) revised its annual capital spending outlook. Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) and Intel ( INTC ) both jumped and were among the top percentage gainers on the Nasdaq Composite ( COMP.IND ).

13191840,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/do-kwon-released-on-bail-after-request-approved,1686081924,Do Kwon Released on Bail After Request Approved,"Terra founder Do Kwon has been released on bail after a Montenegrin court handling his passport forgery case accepted his 400,000-euro request. According to an announcement, a Montenegro High Court granted Do Kwon bail after accepting his 400,000-euro request. The decision comes after a previous approval was overturned on May 25. An official release from the Basic Court in Podgorica stated that an appeal against an earlier bail agreement by the State Prosecutor’s Office was set aside. The decision means that Kwon and his fellow accused, Han Chang-Joon, can await further legal proceedings under house arrest in Montenegro. The value of their property has complicated the decisions regarding the defendant’s bail request. During the initial bail hearing on May 11, Kwon and Chang-Joon told the court that they had “property worth millions.” A High Court, however, disputed the value, and their bail was revoked. The High Court argued that the lower court could not accept the property’s value “based on their statements, but only concrete evidence.” The value of the property has been verified after evaluation using a sales contract, bank account statements, and invoices. The Court said: The court appreciated the fact that they are persons who are not Montenegrin citizens, which is why it accepted their statements about the value of the property they own, which were supported by concrete evidence. It concluded by saying: The possibility of losing the security deposit in the amount of EUR 400,000.00 each had a sufficiently discouraging effect on the defendants to dissuade them from any desire to escape. Kwon and Chang-Joon Arrested in Montenegro The pair were arrested at an airport in the capital of Podgorica on March 23 as they tried to board a flight to Dubai using falsified travel documents. Kwon and Chang-Joon were charged with forging official documents. Shortly after their arrest, the United States and South Korean authorities announced that they were seeking the extradition of Kwon. US federal prosecutors indicted Kwon with two counts each of securities fraud, wire fraud, commodities fraud, and conspiracy. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42410483,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdX4XQ,1686081705,Why Isn’t Bitcoin Falling More? Cryptos Are Acting More Like Commodities Than Securities,"While the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) wants to characterize many crypto assets as securities, the market appears to have a different idea, treating them like commodities.  We’ve reached day two of what appears to be SEC Enforcement Week with the agency filing suits against Binance and Coinbase on successive days.  Both suits are significantly affecting the exchanges, with net transfer volume declining significantly on Binance, and COIN opening the U.S. trading day 20% lower than the prior day’s close.  Meanwhile, bitcoin and ether are up 5% and 4%, respectively, over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin’s 5.4% contraction on Monday, doesn’t even rank within the top 50 largest one-day declines since 2021.  And of the 13 altcoins that the suits named as securities, none have declined more than 3%, with several actually trading higher during the day.  Despite the SEC’s assertion that many cryptocurrencies are securities, the market appears to be voting otherwise.  Additionally, SEC actions toward crypto may actually be highlighting the importance of digital assets in the minds of crypto holders.  Decoupling from crypto organizations?  Bitcoin and ether have recently decoupled from traditional financial indexes like the S&P 500, and now they also appear to be decoupling from crypto organizations themselves. Their separate path from Coinbase's share price aligns more with physical commodities.  The price of crude oil wouldn’t sharply drop simply because the SEC sued ExxonMobil. Nor would the price of Gold plummet if the agency took action against the CEO of Barrick Gold.  Oil is oil, gold is gold – both immutable, ever present and largely unaffected by daily events. Bitcoin, ether, and other assets appear to be operating under a similar rationale.  Much like in the physical commodity space, the greater impact to digital asset prices has been supply (i.e. the reduction in ether supply since September) and demand (i.e. macroeconomic factors impacting consumption).  Bitcoin and ether not falling sharply following enforcement actions against vehicles of distribution (i.e. exchanges), counters the narrative that cryptocurrencies operate under a “greater fool” theory that holds you can make money off an overvalued asset. Instead, investors appear to believe that crypto’s brightest future lies ahead.  At the moment, crypto markets seem to be saying the following…  Yes…regulators can take action against Coinbase and Binance.  But the asset itself continues to hold value.  Coinbase and Binance are separate entities. Bitcoin is bitcoin and ether is ether, and unless all distribution methods are completely eliminated, then markets appear willing to continue ascribing value to them.  Moreover, investors would likely consider any attempt to do so as the type of overreach that caused many of them to see digital assets as valuable to begin with.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/06/why-isnt-bitcoin-falling-more-cryptos-are-acting-more-like-commodities-than-securities,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5e354b2184adf0246ac6005628f5374c35a64dbf-3626x2479.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
13191772,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=536707,1686081649,"Bitcoin (BTC) Rollercoaster Ride: Is $23,000 The End Of The Line?","Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced a negative reaction following the SEC’s continued crackdown on the crypto industry. The regulatory body recently filed a complaint against the largest exchange in the industry, Binance, contributing to Bitcoin’s decline. However, there may be a glimmer of hope for the cryptocurrency, as it has managed to recover the $26,000 level. This is an important threshold for Bitcoin, as it must maintain this level if it hopes to continue its uptrend. Despite visiting lower lows of $25,300, Bitcoin has managed to bounce back from the 200-day Moving Average (MA). This is significant because the 200-day MA has historically been a strong support level for Bitcoin. In other words, when BTC’s price has dropped to this level, it has often bounced back up. This suggests bullish sentiment in the market, as traders continue to see value in buying Bitcoin at this price point. Related Reading: KAVA Holds In Green Despite Bears Taking Control Of Crypto Market Expert Discuss Potential Bottoms At $24,000 And $23,000 However, renowned crypto analyst, Altcoin Sherpa, has weighed in on the current state of the Bitcoin market, sharing insights into where the bottom might be. According to Altcoin Sherpa, Bitcoin has been experiencing a lot of support at the $25,000 level, holding up well despite recent market fluctuations. However, he believes there could be even lower levels of liquidity in the market, which could impact Bitcoin’s price shortly. Altcoin Sherpa points out interesting support areas at the $23,000 and $24,000 levels, potentially serving as a bottom for Bitcoin. However, he advises investors to be patient and wait for the market to find some consolidation before making any investment decisions. The analyst notes that the ‘bottom’ should take time, and investors should look for signs of consolidation before making any moves. He also suggests that it may not be the right time to buy alts or BTC at the current level and that a more cautious approach may be warranted. Bitcoin Faces Critical Test Following the same line, crypto analyst Justin Bennet said the $26,500 level had become resistance after yesterday’s breakdown. The key support area for the week ahead is $25,200, a level that served as resistance for Bitcoin. Bennet expects this to be a significant test for the market, with the potential for ranging price action between $25,200 and $26,500. Bennet advises traders to wait for a confirmed deviation below the $25,200 support level, with channel support near $24,300 serving as a potential technical catalyst. If Bitcoin reclaims the $25,200 level, traders can consider longing BTC within the range. Alternatively, an immediate retest of $26,500 could offer a favorable short opportunity with targets of $25,200 and $24,000.

42410469,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdX3jp,1686081021,Gary Gensler’s Evolving Position on Crypto – in Quotes,"This week, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched two major legal actions against Binance and Coinbase, accusing the exchanges of flouting U.S. securities laws.  At the heart of this offensive is one man: Gary Gensler, who was appointed chair of the SEC in February 2021.  Gensler today looks like the crypto industry’s worst enemy, issuing what sounds like a blanket disavowal of crypto’s whole point-of-being. “We don’t need more digital currency…we already have digital currency, it’s called the U.S. dollar,” Gensler said Tuesday June 6.  Read more: SEC Sues Coinbase on Unregistered Securities Exchange Allegations  “We have not seen, over the centuries, that economies and the public need more than one way to move value.”  But Gensler wasn’t always so trenchant a critic.  Before he started in the SEC hot seat, he was fresh from teaching courses on digital currency at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and consulting with that school’s Digital Currency Initiative.  Here was the tone that Gensler struck in an op-ed for CoinDesk in December 2019: “Though literally thousands of projects have yet to land on broadly adopted use cases, I remain intrigued by Satoshi’s innovation’s potential to spur change – either directly or indirectly as a catalyst. The potential to lower verification and networking costs is worth pursuing, particularly to lower economic rents and data privacy costs, and promote economic inclusion.""  “Further, shared blockchain applications might help jumpstart multiparty network solutions in fields that historically have been fragmented or resilient to change. Even in this slightly less ambitious form – acting as an innovative irritant to incumbents and traditional technologies – cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology have already prompted real change and can continue to do so,"" he added.  These words don’t sound like they come from someone who sees no use for crypto.  In March 2021, in his nomination speech before the U.S. Congress, Gensler praised the transformative role of financial technology, not pointing at crypto in particular, saying that “markets – and technology – are always changing. Our rules have to change along with them” and that “financial technology can be a powerful force for good – but only if we continue to harness the core values of the SEC in service of investors, issuers and the public.”  Read more: Daniel Kuhn - Are Centralized Exchanges in the U.S. Doomed?  Having said that, since his first year as a head of the SEC, Gensler has been consistent in his stance that most cryptocurrencies fit the definition of securities, crypto exchanges need to register with the SEC and stablecoins are “poker chips” for gambling on crypto, which present systemic risk for the economy. He’s sticking to these points in his latest remarks.  Gensler also called for Congress to take steps towards a clearer regulation framework for crypto exchanges, noting that “right now there’s not a market regulator around these crypto exchanges and thus there’s really no protection around fraud or manipulation.”  Around the same time, Gensler said in his Congress testimony that the U.S. government, together with the Congress, should come up with more definitive rules for crypto. “I believe that the SEC, working with the CFTC [U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission] and others, can stand up more robust oversight and investor protection around the field of crypto finance,” Gensler said.  He also has been consistent in believing his agency has jurisdiction over crypto. “The SEC’s authorities in this space are clear,” he said at a House Financial Services Committee hearing in October 2022.  Somewhere in between Gensler’s nomination and this spring, the SEC chairman has changed his mind about the need for clarity, or realized what he was looking for can’t be achieved. The dramatic collapse of FTX, the exchange founded by Sam Bankman-Fried, in November no doubt forced Gensler to act, as lawmakers criticized the SEC for not waking up to FTX’s wrongdoing sooner and failing to protect investors in that enterprise.  In September 2022, Gensler hinted at the potential designation of ether (ETH) as a security. The SEC chair said that proof-of-stake (PoS) tokens could be securities, following the Ethereum blockchain’s monumental shift to that consensus mechanism from proof-of-work (PoW). However, Gensler did not comment on Ethereum specifically at the time.  Then he proceeded to chastise the crypto industry in short videos released on Twitter.  Last fall, Gensler said that the crypto industry has had all the clarity it even needed all along. In his prepared remarks to the Practicing Law Institute in September 2022 he said: “Nothing about the crypto markets is incompatible with the securities laws.”  Read also: Most Influential 2021: Gary Gensler  “Some in the crypto industry have called for greater ‘guidance’ with respect to crypto tokens. For the past five years, though, the commission has spoken with a pretty clear voice here,” he added.  Talking to the Congress in April 2023, Gensler conspicuously avoided answering whether he believes ether is a security or not. In contrast, the CFTC, with which, according to Gensler, the SEC has been working together towards a better industry oversight, has first signaled its opinion on the matter years ago, saying in a 2018 court case that ether is a commodity and sticking to this approach ever since.  Now, Gensler’s approach to crypto sounds openly hostile as he’s arguing that the rules as to what is and isn’t a security have been known and communicated to crypto fully. Talking to CNBC Tuesday, Gensler said “there’s been clarity for years” for crypto, and exchanges just “need to come into compliance.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/06/06/gary-genslers-evolving-position-on-crypto-in-quotes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ac617909f809928849abf2fab1f0201b0b365848-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The upgrade, also known as a hard fork, aims to improve the functionality of the chain by cutting deposit-confirmation times from 10 minutes to 1 minute, and lowers gas fees by 40%.  The software upgrade occurred at 16:00 UTC (12:00pm ET) on Tuesday, and completed at 18:50 UTC (2:50pm ET) according to a tweet from the Optimism Foundation. At the time of writing, several key elements of external infrastructure for Optimism is still coming back online, and the Foundation said that the public endpoint will go live around 20:00 UTC (4:00pm ET).  Bedrock also is supposed to improve proof modularity for its OP Stack, which is an open-source platform for developers where they can build customizable blockchains with Optimism. The improvements to the OP stack means that both validity proofs and fault proofs can be used.  In addition, Bedrock has made Optimism into a multi-client ecosystem, meaning there would be at least two options for the client software used to run the network.  According to Floersch, this would make Optimism the first layer 2 to run on a multi-client ecosystem, which helps strengthen the blockchain by reducing possibilities of network downtime; if there’s a bug in one client software, then the blockchain can rely on the other users running the other client software to keep the blockchain live.  $OP, the native token for Optimism, was up 10% over the last 24 hours following the Bedrock upgrade.

Related Reading: No All-Time High For Bitcoin In 2023, Former BitMEX Head Arthur Hayes Predicts In his lengthy post, Hoskinson thinks the SEC wants to implement ‘Chokepoint 2.0’ in the country based on the implications of its complaints. He also pointed out the extensive nature of the complaint, which amounted to 136 pages stating that it could be an integral part of a plan to maintain strict control over the personal financial lives of people. Hoskinson further observed that the SEC’s lawsuit against Binance is not just centered on compliance issues with the exchange. He is concerned that the regulator may include the creation of a centrally-backed digital currency (CBDC) connected to a group of chosen and powerful banks. Such a move could provide the government absolute control over every area of financial activities from the customers. And Hoskinson thinks that the SEC’s action displays a political and philosophical disagreement on the existence of crypto and its core principles. Additionally, he mentioned that a group of unappointed persons had streamlined some operations as inappropriate for the open market. These include wallet ownership, economic agency, and self-sovereign identity. So, the SEC intends to have just a few individuals enjoying these privileges. Hoskinson maintained that historically, the current play-out of events indicated the recurring battle between freedom and authoritarianism. According to him, it is not a completely new situation; rather, the clash is between different players and technology, with a change in wording.

Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), which initially slid after the news, has erased most of the decline and at about 11:36 AM is down 0.3% to almost $26K. As recently as April 17, the token had been trading at ~$30K. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), meanwhile, completely reversed its drop, adding 0.7% . Since at least 2019, Coinbase ( COIN ) has unlawfully facilitated the buying and selling of crypto asset securities, the SEC said, according to its complaint. The suit comes a day after the regulator sued Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, and its CEO for allegedly violating U.S. securities regulations. ""We allege that Coinbase, despite being subject to the securities laws, commingled and unlawfully offered exchange, broker-dealer, and clearinghouse functions,"" said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. ""In other parts of our securities markets, these functions are separate."" Update at 11:28 AM ET: In addition, individual states are exerting pressure in the crypto space. Alabama issued a ""show cause order"" that gives Coinbase ( COIN ) 28 days to show why it shouldn't be directed to stop selling unregistered securities in the state. The order is the result of a multi-state task force of 10 states securities regulators, the Alabama Securities Commission said in a statement Tuesday. The states allege that Coinbase ( COIN ) violated securities law by offering a staking rewards program without a registration to offer or sell securities. Under staking, investors lock their crypto assets for a set period to help support the operations of a blockchain. In exchange, the investors are promised more crypto assets, the states said. Other states taking action against the crypto exchange are: California, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, South Carolina, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin. Crypto-related stocks also mostly recovered from their early swoon. MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) +3.5% after announcing a new AI partnership with Microsoft ; Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) -0.8% ; Marathon Digital ( MARA ) +1.4% ; Hive Blockchain ( HIVE ) +0.3% . The SEC has long contended that most digital tokens qualify as securities rather than currency. In 2018, though, an SEC official had said that neither bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) nor ethereum ( ETH-USD ) are securities. 2:40 PM ET: Coinbase ( COIN ) has been wrangling with the SEC for months. In March, when the crypto exchange received a Wells notice for a potential enforcement action from the SEC, the company said the SEC has refused to respond to its proposals regarding registration. In April, Coinbase ( COIN ) sued the SEC seeking to force a response on its rulemaking petition. The confusion over crypto regulation is far from resolved. In a document on Tuesday, the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation, a group made up of finance industry leaders, academics, former poliymakers and legal and accounting experts, said :""the SEC's own policies in fact make it impossible for crypto asset trading platform to do what the SEC now insists that they do — that is, registering and operating in compliance with the regulatory framework for securities exchanges.""

( NASDAQ: BTCS ) on Tuesday pointed out the differences between its cryptocurrency staking model and Coinbase Global's ( COIN ). Earlier on Tuesday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Coinbase ( COIN ), saying that it's violating securities regulations by offering crypto assets that qualify as securities. A group of 11 states also said COIN's staking rewards program breaks securities law. BTCS ( BTCS ) uses a non-custodial staking model, in contrast with Kraken, Coinbase ( COIN ) and those that use custodial models, i.e., in which they hold investors' private keys to their crypto in the staking process. The difference between the two models is that BTCS's StakeSeeker ""operates within the Howey test and does not in our view create securities,"" the company said. The SEC uses the Howey test to determine if a product is a security. Under that test, an investment contract exists ""when there is the investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others,"" the SEC said . BTCS ( BTCS ) said its staking does not keep custody of the crypto assets being staked, does not pool crypto assets with others, and does not have the expectation of generating profits from the efforts of others. ""We have proactively analyzed our staking model and drawn conclusions that align with those presented by Coinbase regarding 'Core Staking' and while we believe our non-custodial staking does not create securities, we cannot provide assurances that either the SEC or other regulatory authorities will agree,"" BTCS CEO Charles Allen said.

42410479,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdX4NV,1686076004,"One-Two Punch Finally Registers SEC View on Binance, Coinbase, Rest of Crypto","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) tore off crypto’s bandage this week, with its back-to-back enforcement actions against two of the most prominent digital assets platforms, Binance and Coinbase (COIN), finally establishing its legal argument against the industry and setting up the future court fights that could decide everything.  Apart from the “extensive web of deception” alleged in the securities regulator’s lawsuit against Binance, the enforcement double feature also overlapped considerably in the SEC’s basic argument against the crypto business model’s clash with longstanding securities laws. Virtually every business activity conducted by the crypto platforms needs to be registered with the agency and must follow securities regulations under the watchdog’s oversight, the agency contends in these actions and in months of previous enforcement and speeches, and virtually every crypto asset they handle should also be registered as securities.  “I think the sheriff is in town and making their presence known,” said Terrence Yang, a former Wall Street lawyer who is a managing director at Swan Bitcoin. The takeaway, in his view: “People should double up on compliance.”  The SEC accused both Binance and Coinbase of operating unregistered exchanges, and offering the sale of unregistered securities, including Binance’s own digital assets: BNB and the Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin. Those now-familiar charges – echoed in other recent SEC actions – have now reached their logical destination and will likely be repeated down through the industry ranks if the regulator’s latest actions end up victorious.  “These super big multinational exchanges that operate globally across different jurisdictions are just going to have a really, really hard time because the policymakers around the world are getting very, very strict,” said Gustavo Schwenkler, who teaches at Santa Clara University business school and serves on the board of a crypto exchange.  The legal positions taken by the SEC make it “much harder to operate” a U.S. crypto platform, Schwenkler said. “The question about what is a security or not is kind of settled for the agency,” he said, which could limit what any of the rest of the exchanges – such as Kraken, Gemini and crypto.com – can do without SEC trouble.  The agency’s legal position gathers “the types of charges from several years' worth of narrower enforcement actions against other digital asset market players,” said Joshua Ashley Klayman, the U.S. head of digital assets at Linklaters LLP. “It provides a comprehensive map for how the SEC views the crypto landscape and how it views the various moving parts.”  One-stop shops  The regulator went after the companies for operating simultaneously as exchanges, brokers, dealers and clearing agencies without registering in any of those categories in the U.S. That’s been a constant complaint of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, that crypto firms offer one-stop services that tend to set up conflicts of interest with the companies’ customers.  “We allege that Coinbase, despite being subject to the securities laws, commingled and unlawfully offered exchange, broker-dealer, and clearinghouse functions,” Gensler said in a Tuesday statement.  Read More: U.S. Court Tells SEC to Respond to Coinbase's Rulemaking Petition Within a Week  Crypto lawyer Collins Belton had tweeted on Monday that “the SEC is alleging that Binance, like Trex, Beaxy, Coinbase, and every other crypto trading platform is essentially operating an unregistered exchange, but also provides clearing services and acts as a [broker-dealer]for its customers, and hasn't registered as any of those.”  As Rajeev Bamra of Moody’s Investors Service put it after the Binance news: “These charges have the potential to reshape the regulatory landscape for digital assets.” They’ll create pressures on the other companies “to adapt their practices accordingly,” he said.  The SEC is accustomed to enforcement following a familiar track and usually ending in a consent order in which a company agrees to fix the problems flagged by the agency, pay the fine and move on. But in several cases with the crypto sector, the companies are pushing back and forcing the agency into prolonged court battles. Arguably the most famous example is Ripple and its defense against the SEC’s view of XRP as an unregistered security.  The primary reason for these companies’ willingness to fight is that the accusations are going after make-or-break components of the digital assets businesses. If the SEC says an exchange can’t be an exchange and has to halt trading, the decision for the company is: Shut down the business or keep going and fight the regulator in court.  “We now join a number of other crypto projects facing similarly misguided actions from the SEC and we will vigorously defend our business and the industry,” Binance said in a response on Monday. “The coins do not represent an investment contract of any sort and as such are not securities.”  And from Coinbase on Tuesday:  “The SEC's reliance on an enforcement-only approach in the absence of clear rules for the digital asset industry is hurting America’s economic competitiveness and companies like Coinbase that have a demonstrated commitment to compliance,” said Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s chief legal officer and general counsel, who said the solution will be action from Congress. “In the meantime, we’ll continue to operate our business as usual.”  Yang noted that other crypto firms may have been nervous to see the SEC’s unusual request in the case against Binance (along with Binance.US) that the court intervene on an emergency basis to restrain the company’s activities. It effectively leaves Binance “in the fight for their lives,” he said. But that wasn’t repeated for Coinbase.  Bittrex and Kraken have already been through the enforcement ringer, with Kraken having bowed to a settlement that meant scrapping the staking services that the SEC labeled as unregistered securities. Kraken’s exchange operation hasn’t yet been directly targeted.  “Gensler sees the big exchanges as a key to cracking down on the industry broadly, since they’re the venues where relatively ordinary investors interact with crypto,” said Ian Katz, an analyst with Capital Alpha, in a Monday research note.  Compare and contrast  Binance itself sought to make the clash primarily about the SEC-registration accusations, rather than acknowledging the agency’s accusations that founder Changpeng Zhao and his senior management deliberately and secretly tried to get around U.S. oversight and improperly handled the money of U.S. investors.  “They attempted to evade U.S. securities laws by announcing sham controls that they disregarded behind the scenes so that they could keep high-value U.S. customers on their platforms,” Gensler said in a statement. “The public should beware of investing any of their hard-earned assets with or on these unlawful platforms.”  In its tweeting about the case, the SEC highlighted a remark from a chief compliance officer at Binance, who is quoted in the lawsuit as telling another compliance official, “We are operating as a fking unlicensed securities exchange in the USA bro.”  Nelson Rosario, a Chicago-based digital assets lawyer who has also taught crypto classes, said that quote “is in the universe of worst possible things for them to say in writing.”  That level of drama – the accusations of intentionally misleading the regulators and investors, and improperly mixing and moving customer money – wasn’t repeated in the lengthy Coinbase lawsuit, setting up a stark contrast between the two.  “I do fundamentally believe that Coinbase is a different company that Binance,” Schwenkler said. “Their compliance is probably much stronger than Binance.”  Coinbase – regulated as a U.S. public company – has already been at war with the SEC, even before the agency brings its planned enforcement action. The firm has been fighting the regulator in court, having called for a judge to compel the agency to give formal guidance to the crypto industry, to which the agency responded that no special rules are needed.  In both the Binance and Coinbase cases, the regulator issued a long list of crypto tokens being traded on the platforms despite the SEC’s view they’re unregistered securities. But the SEC hasn’t yet gone after the issuers of those tokens, apart from the platforms such as Binance – and FTX before it – that put out their own.  “Again the SEC claims that particular digital assets are illegally offered securities without suing their issuers, or even identifying their issuers,” said Patrick Daugherty, a lawyer who once worked at the SEC but now represents crypto companies and exchanges at Foley & Lardner in Chicago. “An SEC allegation is not a judicial judgment. It is not a binding legal determination. But neither can it be ignored. The SEC knows this. By asserting that these assets are securities, the SEC is attempting to chill the market for them without having proved its case in court.”  Awaiting Congress  At this stage, the crypto sector has turned virtually all of its hopes toward the U.S. Congress to finally force new crypto-specific regulations, such as those suggested last week by Republicans in the House of Representatives.  The draft bill revealed in the House “is a step forward to not only craft effective regulation for digital assets, but also rein in Chair Gensler’s relentless crusade,” said Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, a crypto advocacy organization in Washington.  “The SEC actions appear to be signaling a move to meaningfully change existing crypto market structure,” Klayman said. “Interestingly, this move occurs as many in Congress are squarely focused on crypto market structure, as well.”  But the scandal-tinged SEC action against Binance, exposing what the agency alleges is the dirty laundry of the world’s biggest exchange, and the long-awaited suit against Coinbase may not help convince House Democrats and the Senate to rally to the crypto cause.  “The Binance allegations are probably unhelpful to House Republicans’ renewed effort to push ahead with crypto legislation,” Katz argued.  Even if U.S. lawmakers moved toward action, the pace of the SEC has become more rapid than Congress. Crypto companies are finding SEC lawyers at their door, and no crypto law is yet waiting on the horizon.",NEGATIVE,BNB,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/06/one-two-punch-finally-registers-sec-view-on-binance-coinbase-rest-of-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/235449bc0bf3d24803de1ab7af02a8d70eaf2562-2880x1620.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Blockchain data by crypto intelligence firm Nansen shows that Coinbase net outflows over a 24-hour period totaled $600 million. Traders have withdrawn $1.38 billion of cryptocurrencies during this period, compared to $771 million of deposits, per Nansen. The data excludes bitcoin (BTC) transfers.  The outflows happened as the SEC, the top U.S. securities regulator, hit Coinbase with a lawsuit for violating federal securities regulations only a day after suing rivals Binance.US and Binance. Additionally, a slew of U.S. state regulators suspect that Coinbase broke the law by offering staking rewards to users in its “Earn” program.  Read More: Binance Crypto Exchange: Your Questions Answered  Traders have withdrawn funds from Coinbase in two waves, data shows. On Monday, net outflows reached $450 million within an hour following the lawsuit against Binance before stabilizing, according to Nansen data. Withdrawals rose again on Tuesday following the suit against Coinbase, then subsided. At the time of publication, net flows for the past hour turned positive, per Nansen.  The withdrawal surge on Binance has been even larger following the regulatory actions. Net outflows surpassed $700 million on Monday, according to data compiled by 21Shares. It is the largest daily outflow since February, when New York state regulators forced a halt to the issuance of the Binance-related stablecoin BUSD. The trend continued on Tuesday, with net outflows surpassing $1.2 billion over the past 24 hours, according to Nansen data.  The magnitude of the outflows aligns with prior stressful events in the crypto industry, including the crypto banking crisis in March and the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange late last year.

42410468,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdX3n8,1686075184,Binance Crypto Exchange: Your Questions Answered,"Founded in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao, who is often referred to as just “CZ,” Binance is the world's leading cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume as of June 2023. The company was originally based in China but had to leave Shanghai due to regulatory restrictions shortly after its launch.  Binance developed its own blockchain, Binance Smart Chain (later renamed to BNB Chain), which facilitates trades on the exchange. The native token of the blockchain is Binance coin (BNB) and the company has also launched a stablecoin, BinanceUSD (BUSD). Because of U.S. regulatory rules, Binance created a supposedly separate company for its U.S. clients in 2019, Binance.US.  On June 5, 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed charges against Binance.US as well as CZ, who serves as Binance CEO, on allegations of violating federal securities laws by offering BNB and BUSD to the general public, calling them unregistered securities. The SEC lawsuit also casts fresh doubt on the independence of the company’s U.S. arm and its staking service.  Read more about the SEC suit here  This is not Binance’s first battle with U.S. regulators. Binance is also under ongoing scrutiny from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) who sued CZ and Binance in March 2023, alleging the company knowingly offered unregistered crypto derivatives products in the U.S.  Here is everything you need to know about Binance, Binance.US and CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao.  Who is Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao and why did he launch Binance?  CZ is a well-known personality in crypto, actively engaging with the crypto community through Twitter and speaking at conferences and to the media. As for his origins, he was born in China and emigrated to Canada when he was 12 and says he is a Canadian citizen. In high school, he worked part-time at McDonald’s, which is part of his well-known lore. He graduated from McGill University with a degree in Computer Science.  After college, he worked for the Tokyo stock exchange and Bloomberg Tradebook developing software for the businesses. He then founded a startup in 2005, Fusion Systems, which focused on creating an automated high-frequency trading platform. Following that, he worked for several crypto startups including a stint as co-founder and CTO of OKCoin. Another piece of the CZ lore is that he first heard about Bitcoin at a poker game, which planted the seed that led him to create his own cryptocurrency exchange, Binance.  According to the white paper, Zhao's goal for Binance was to compete with other exchanges by offering solutions to the numerous problems he saw with the cryptocurrency trading infrastructure – including poor technical architecture, insecure platforms, low market liquidity, poor customer support and poor language support.  Shortly after Binance’s 2017 launch, Binance raised $15 million through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for BNB, the terms of which were also laid out in the white paper.  What’s the difference between Binance and Binance.US?  Binance started as one big company, founded in Shanghai in 2017. Because of China’s crackdown on crypto, the company left shortly after and while there were efforts to relocate the headquarters to Singapore and Malta was once thought to be Binance’s base, CZ currently claims that Binance has no headquarters and that wherever he is, that is where Binance is based.  Binance also has a native coin, Binance Coin (BNB), which was initially launched on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token and subsequently migrated to Binance's proprietary blockchain, BNB Chain. BNB functions as an exchange token, meaning holders of BNB with Binance accounts can access discounted fees on the exchange.  Binance created Binance.US in 2019 in response to regulatory requirements in the United States and notified customers that their accounts would be required to migrate to the new U.S-based exchange in November 2020. That said, many people noted that by using a VPN service, U.S.-based customers could still use Binance’s services.  One of the biggest differences between the two exchanges is that Binance.com offers a much wider range of cryptocurrencies, with over 500 available for trading. Binance.US offers over 120 cryptocurrencies and is not available in all states as of writing, with Hawaii, New York, Texas, and Vermont blocking use of the exchange.  The other big difference is that Binance.US does not offer margin trading or futures contracts, while Binance does. Both platforms offer low fees.  Finally, unlike Binance’s stance that it has no headquarters, the U.S. arm is clearly based in Palo Alto, California. The SEC suit is specifically against Binance.US and Zhao and not the larger exchange.  Binance: A timeline of major events and notable news  July 2017: Binance launches and raises $15 million through its BNB ICO.

December 2022: Binance.US reaches an agreement to buy Voyager Digital's assets for just over $1 billion. Voyager, had gone into bankruptcy earlier in 2022 and originally had agreed to sell its assets to FTX, which folded itself.  February 2023: BUSD issuer Paxos is hit with a one-two punch of an investigation by the New York Department of Financial Services and a Wells Notice from the SEC, which some believed hinted at Binance as a future target for the SEC. Following these actions, Paxos halted minting BUSD.  March 2023: The CFTC sues CZ and Binance over allegations that the company offered unregistered crypto derivatives products.  April 2023: Rumors of an Interpol “Red Notice” for CZ tank BNB price, but there is little to back up the claim.

The SEC filed a lawsuit on Tuesday, accusing Coinbase of operating without proper registration, thereby violating regulations designed to safeguard investors. This lawsuit has sent shockwaves through the crypto market, impacting not only the global cryptocurrency market but also Coinbase’s stock value and triggering concerns about the broader implications for the industry. The SEC Lawsuit Against Coinbase In a complaint lodged with the Manhattan federal court, the SEC alleges that Coinbase has been functioning as an unregistered broker since about 2019, breaching disclosure requirements aimed at protecting investors. Related Reading: When Is A Token Coming For Coinbase’s Base L2? Here’s What The Roadmap Says The regulator also claims that Coinbase, through its various services such as Coinbase Prime and Coinbase Wallet, facilitated cryptocurrency transactions without obtaining the necessary authorization. SEC Chair Gary Gensler emphasized the gravity of Coinbase’s alleged failures, stating that they deprived investors of crucial protections against fraud, manipulation, conflicts of interest, and routine inspections. The SEC chairman noted: Coinbase’s alleged failures deprive investors of critical protections, including rulebooks that prevent fraud and manipulation, proper disclosure, safeguards against conflicts of interest, and routine inspection. During an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, Gensler remarks about crypto trading platforms and questioned their operational models. He highlighted the fact that these platforms, often referred to as exchanges, encompasses various functions that go beyond traditional exchange activities. Drawing a comparison, he said that the New York Stock Exchange does not engage in hedge fund operations. Market Impact And COIN Stock Decline News of the SEC lawsuit had an immediate impact on Coinbase’s stock value, which plunged significantly during premarket trading following the filing. The legal action against Coinbase comes on the heels of the SEC’s recent lawsuit against Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, and its founder Changpeng Zhao, further intensifying scrutiny on the industry. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) Dominance Trend Shifts Alongside Stablecoin Flows: Glassnode In the wake of the SEC lawsuit, Coinbase’s stock (COIN) has experienced a significant downturn, recording a 13% loss in just one day.

42410474,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdX46y,1686072314,How AI is Transforming Music Creation in Web3,"In April 2023, Warner Music Group chief digital officer and executive vice president of business development Oana Ruxandra told CoinDesk’s The Hash that she expects music tools driven by artificial intelligence (AI) to “open up the world like we haven’t before,” inspiring “new forms of creativity and sub-genres” across the music and entertainment industries.  While Ruxandra’s outlook is optimistic, she also acknowledged the concerns of many musicians: “We have to be very vigilant,” she said, noting the importance of protecting the creativity and rights of artists. Just days before Ruxandra’s appearance on The Hash, an AI-generated deep-fake music track titled Heart On My Sleeve gained traction by mimicking the voices of songwriters Drake and the Weeknd – even though neither artist had participated in its creation. Instead, the song’s creators trained the artificial intelligence bot using music by the artists, which angered label owner Universal Music Group over.  Other musicians have been more welcoming to the new technology. Less than a week later, electropop musician Grimes invited her fans to create their own AI-dubbed songs using her voice and extended the offer to split royalties 50/50, demonstrating one creative solution to the AI deep-fake conundrum.  Keeping intellectual property challenges in mind, there’s still no doubt that AI music tools can place new forms of expression at an artist’s fingertips. Sometimes, AI can even be used to enhance music production by filling in technical or intellectual gaps in an artist’s abilities, helping them bring ambitious concepts to life in a matter of clicks. These tools can also perform sound engineering tasks more efficiently, lowering barriers and the time it takes to release music.  As we look toward Web3, companies and artists are taking AI even further by pairing music with immersive, interactive and user-generated experiences in the metaverse and beyond.  AI music tools in Web3  A number of crypto-native musicians and platforms have already found creative ways to integrate AI tools into their practice.  Take VNCCII, for instance, the metaverse-first alter-ego of Sydney-based female producer Samantha Tauber. Utilizing the industry-leading real-time 3D creation tool, Unreal Engine, Tauber dons her avatar to stream live broadcast interviews from the metaverse, in addition to performing in virtual concerts and shows. Like any set or costume change, the digital component of VNCCII’s artistic identity is expanding the borders of her artistry.  Web3 music company PIXELNYX combines augmented reality (AR) experiences with metaverse gaming and is focused on helping artists build memorable experiences for fans. Co-founded by the electronic music producer Deadmau5, who has been known for sending fans on quests through The Sandbox and hosting shows in Decentraland, PIXELNYX aims to evolve our traditional notions of fandom through the use of AI, Web3 and user-generated content (UGC).  In April, PIXELNYX released Korus, a tool that allows users to create AI-powered music companions using officially-licensed artist content.  When used in this spirit, AI music tools can aid, augment or enhance an artist’s creative style. While the tools are not good enough yet to replace artists, they are impressive and constantly “learning” through continued human interaction. Replacing musicians with AI has never been a popular take, as proven by the pushback Spotify received after testing its own version of artificial music curation. Yet despite the controversy surrounding AI, today’s musical artists may be able to benefit from using AI-assisted music production in ways that respect the craft.  Ideation and collaboration  WarpSound, an adaptive AI music platform, has found several ways to integrate blockchain-based collectibles and digital avatars into its business offerings. The company, which produces music content, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and social experiences, is soon releasing a software API that composes original music note-by-note in a range of styles.  Founder and CEO Chris McGarry, an entrepreneur and media executive who previously severed as the music lead at Facebook’s virtual reality unit Oculus, says WarpSound’s tools help artists find new inspiration and source material that invigorates their creative processes. The company is the recipient of The Sandbox’s Game Maker Fund, which supports game designers in The Sandbox metaverse, and plans to build a home venue inside the platform where artists can experiment with generative music.  WarpSound also worked with Mastercard as the AI music partner for their Artist Accelerator program, where McGarry says he’s observed new benefits to the creative process.  “Last week, I was in a set of virtual studio sessions with artists participating in the program,” said McGarry. “We were working with our generative AI music interface to present a set of musical ideas, then having the artist shape those and iterate until they landed on something, the essence of which resonated with them, that they were motivated to work with.”  WarpSound has also partnered with the Tribeca Film Festival and YouTube to create interactive and playful music experiences between artists and audiences.  Composing and arrangement  If your music project is less about live performance and more about the finished product — maybe you’re composing original music for a podcast, metaverse event, YouTube channel, Web3 video game or educational content — you can use AI to speed up the process of composition and arrangement. Of course, the world’s most talented virtuosos can likely do musical scales in their sleep, but with so many elements to sound and video production, it’s becoming standard practice to use AI to insert quick scales, arpeggios, runs and harmonies to original music.  Tools like Riffusion allow users to provide text prompts that are transformed into music. Soundful is another AI platform that allows people to generate and download royalty-free tracks.  If you want to go one step further and add lyrics, the popular do-it-all tool ChatGPT can write a two-verse song with a pre-chorus, chorus, bridge and outro in just under 30 seconds with minimal prompting. Of course, the lyrics may be a touch simplistic or cheesy — but aren’t some of the best songs?  In most cases, songs generated by AI are reproducible without the need to pay licensing fees, given they were made by machines and therefore not protected under U.S. intellectual property law. Most platforms, however, charge a subscription fee.  These sounds can then be minted as NFTs and sold on marketplaces like OpenSea. Platforms like Royal.io also allow artists to join the site and offer their songs as fractionalized NFTs that offer royalty payouts to fans.  Read more: What Are Music NFTs?  The limits of AI music production  You may have already heard that musical AI tools aren’t yet that sophisticated, especially when compared to the latest AI text-to-image generators (which have already been used to spin out whole comic book collections) and Open AI’s chatbot, Chat GPT (which reportedly passed the Bar exam).  Audio production indeed requires more computing power than static text and image outputs and therefore is lagging behind, according to experts in the field. Alexander Flores, head of tech and strategy at the music research network, Water & Music, says that tech innovation generally travels from the least data-intensive formats to the richest. In the case of AI, it makes sense why chatbots are perhaps faster to develop than AI audio and video rendering.  In one online discussion thread, a Reddit user pointed out these limitations, emphasizing that while a writer can proofread and edit an AI chatbot’s outputs in seconds, it takes several minutes to listen to a song, and sometimes even hours to edit it. Machines are also slower to learn from AI datasets since audio files that feed them rarely have comprehensive text descriptions to teach the AI about the file’s attributes (genre, tempo, key, instrumentation, etc.). Meanwhile, text and image-based AIs can swiftly trawl through thousands of words and visuals.  “How long it takes to consume the content matters a lot,” said Flores. “With a song, you're locked in for three minutes. You can't speed it up because then you're not experiencing the actual song as it was written.”  In addition, images are static, while songs are more dynamic: “Audio is just much higher dimensional,” said Stefan Lattner, managing researcher at Sony CSL, a creative technology lab, in a panel at Water & Music’s inaugural Wavelengths Summit. “While images have a fixed number of pixels, in audio you have a variable number of seconds that you want to generate.”  Nonetheless, Water & Music calls creative AI the most disruptive technology for the music business since Napster, the peer-to-peer file-sharing application that made music distribution virtually free, as well as borderless and permissionless – a concept familiar to crypto-natives.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MANA | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | AR,Megan DeMatteo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/06/06/how-ai-is-transforming-music-creation-in-web3,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4b8cb0b1a839a796f983efa9dd03b8bb54146c00-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

With a number of alt-coins listed in the Binance complaint, ""our interpretation is that this language is a potential sign that the SEC views alt-coins (i.e., non-Bitcoin or Ethereum tokens) as securities,"" he said. In the Coinbase ( COIN ) suit, the SEC specifically named a number of popular alt-coins, including solana ( SOL-USD ) and cardano ( ADA-USD ), that are offered and sold as investment contracts, ""and thus as securities.""

In addition, the SEC said the crypto assets that it considers securities aren't limited to that list. ""In the event that alt-coins require registration, the cumbersome process and risk of application denial for tokens may inhibit COIN's ability to generate transaction revenue,"" Dolev said. He noted that alt-coins accounted for ~45% of Coinbase's ( COIN ) trading volumes and ~46% of transaction revenue, or ~22% of total company revenue. Dolev reiterated the firm's Underperform rating on the stock with a price target of $27. Coinbase ( COIN ) stock dropped 14% in Tuesday midday trading to $50.74 at 1:01 PM ET.

13186064,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=536672,1686070801,Not Immune To FUD? Binance Sees $1.5 Billion In Outflows In 24 Hours,"EThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced on June 5 that it had sued the largest crypto exchange in the world, Binance, for alleged securities fraud. The announcement triggered a market crash as BNB’s price and others suffered, and users clamored to remove their crypto from the exchange. $1.5 Billion In Withdrawals In 24 Hours In the 24 hours following the SEC’s announcement, the volume of withdrawals from Binance saw a surge, as expected. According to data from DeFiLlama, Binance’s net flows climbed quickly but with outflows remaining high, it offset all of the inflows as withdrawals dominated its volume. In total, the exchange saw $1.5 billion in crypto assets leave the exchange in the 24-hour period following the SEC announcement. Related Reading: LSD Tokens Rally As Ethereum Staking Ramps Up, Here Are The Leaders On-chain data aggregation firm Nansen also reported on the Binance outflows. The dashboard showed that transfers on the Ethereum blockchain alone on the exchange reached a negative net flow of $778 million on the worldwide platform, while the US arm saw negative net flows of $12,982,964. Outflows reach $1.5 billion | Source: DeFiLlama Trading volume on the exchange has also remained high during this time with $6.24 billion in spot volume in the one-day period. Open interest on the trading platform also climbed to $8.8 billion with an average leverage of 0.17x. Despite the outflows, Binance still remains ahead of the rest of the market with around $50 billion in assets in its reserves. This means that the $1.5 billion in outflows only accounts for less than 3% of the exchange’s total reserves. Can Binance Recover From Here? This is not Binance’s first rodeo when it comes to an event triggering massive outflows from the exchange. In fact, the current outflows remain in the realm of ‘normal’ for the exchange which saw over $2 billion in single-day outflows back in December 2022. Given that the exchange was able to come out of the FTX event unscathed even after investor trust had been eroded greatly, the possibility of it coming out of this unscathed as well remains high given the outflows are lower. CEO Changpeng Zhao has also adopted a new mantra of ‘Ignore FUD’ this year as he has assured users in the past that their funds are safe.

The grand plan This must have been thought out a while ago. First sue Binance, and before the dust even settles, sue Coinbase. It hasn’t happened yet, but it really wouldn’t be a surprise if the SEC served Tether with a Wells Notice in the near future. All planned to sow fear and distrust among retail investors and scare them out of the crypto market. Of course, cutting off the banks that do business with crypto, getting the main market makers to back off from the sector, and embroiling the big exchanges in expensive litigation are also part of the Operation Choke Point plan. Crypto market rebounds With all of this as a backdrop, the crypto market has the audacity to start rebounding after yesterday’s Binance news and today’s similar news for Coinbase. Of course, when the Binance news dropped yesterday it came out of the blue and the crypto market did take a hammering. Bitcoin fell fairly precipitously 6.4% on the day, going as low as just under $25,400, from $27,100 at the previous day’s close. However, even amid today’s fresh news of the SEC going after Coinbase, bitcoin has staged a recovery and is up 3.6% so far at time of going to press. Part of the reason for this is that technically, the charts were pointing to a new upsurge for Bitcoin, and the bad news has just caused a blip. All the short term time frame Stochastic RSIs have reset at the bottom, and even the daily and the weekly RSIs are on their way down as well. When these all cross up from the bottom the momentum is going to be difficult to stop. Strong fundamental cryptos are surging The same story is also being played out for many of the more fundamentally sound crypto projects. Ethereum has rebounded 4.4% since yesterday’s low point, making back two thirds of the losses so far. Hot crypto projects such as decentralised exchange Injective Protocol ($INJ), and decentralised GPU-based rendering solution Render ($RNDR) are both coming back fast, making 4.8% and 5.7% respectively so far today. Joke coin has its day Even meme coin Pepe ($PEPE) has made a move like Lazarus from the dead, increasing 26% from yesterday’s low. Let battle commence The crypto market is rebounding because it was in the charts. Be that as it may, stand by for more anti-crypto action from the US government and its financial enforcement agencies. The war has only just begun.

42410471,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdX3x3,1686069942,Are Centralized Exchanges in the U.S. Doomed?,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has opened a full-frontal assault on the cryptocurrency exchange industry with separate lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, the largest such enterprises in the world and the U.S., respectively.  Led by Chair Gary Gensler, the securities watchdog yesterday levied 13 serious securities violation accusations against Binance, including that the exchange failed to meaningfully separate its global and U.S.-based operations, put customer funds at risk and engaged in a “calculated effort to evade the law.”  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Perhaps most seriously, in an allegation that recalls the crooked dealings between Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto exchange FTX and hedge fund Alameda Research, the SEC has accused Binance of commingling billions of dollars of customer assets through a third-party called Merit Peak Limited, which is owned by CEO Changpeng Zhao.  The charges against Coinbase – which has built a reputation as a crypto exchange willing until recently to work inside the bounds of the law – are almost as devastating.  But neither of these civil suits are all that surprising. In March, the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed a lengthy suit against Binance, including many complaints that are repeated in the SEC court documents. And, earlier this year, the SEC sent Coinbase a “Well’s notice,” which usually indicates the agency is building a case and intends to file charges.  The question now appears to be whether Binance or Coinbase will be subject to even more serious criminal charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice. In Binance’s case, it’s long been rumored (and reported) that the DOJ is thinking through a case – though, according to Reuters, it appears to be split internally on the way forward.  Further, there appear to be several dissenters at the SEC, who argue the organization should have done more to provide a pathway for firms to “come into compliance” with the law. Most notably, Hester Peirce, one of five SEC commissioners, has said that, even if Gensler and the SEC’s actions are motivated by a real desire to protect investors, what they’ve done is spun uncertainty.  In a recent CoinDesk TV interview, Peirce said one way for her employer to “plant a flag” and establish dominance over the nascent crypto industry is to file enforcement actions. It’s become rote to suggest that U.S. authorities are “regulating by enforcement” and are also wrapped up in turf wars with other agencies, but the claims do have a ring of truth.  It’s not unheard of for the SEC and CFTC to go after the same target, but it does seem like a waste of resources for agencies that are perennially underfunded. And trying to establish which watchdog – securities or commodities – should take point has been a legislative nightmare, and frankly a national embarrassment.  See also: U.S. House Republicans Push for Crypto Oversight With Bill to Make SEC Play Ball  Essentially the function of the SEC is to set standards for companies to follow. These include disclosure rules and protocols to prevent the criminal misuse of money (like laundering ill-gotten funds and financing terrorists). The agency is not necessarily tasked with rooting out bad actors, going against what many crypto activists mistakenly believe.  But, by filing suit, the SEC and CFTC do have a remarkable ability to signal what type of businesses or practices are less-than-desired in a functioning economy. And by going after the two biggest fish in crypto, it’s becoming clear that all exchanges are at risk. Scratch any financial firm and you’ll find it bleeds financial infractions, especially in an industry as rough-and-tumble as crypto.  What regulators want  But the idea that exchanges, as they currently operate, are not exactly welcome in the U.S. is not a new risk – even though the SEC’s recent cases are a reality check.  Gensler has been saying for years that existing financial rules apply to crypto services providers, that cryptocurrencies resemble securities unless issued under very specific conditions (in fact, labeling at least 61 specific tokens as securities in its various lawsuits) and that exchange operators have a responsibility to “come in and register” with the SEC.  There are many reports of crypto companies opening a dialogue with the SEC and having those meetings go belly up. (And a handful of counter-examples.) But the real fundamental change the SEC wants is for crypto companies to offer up more insight into who is using these platforms and how.  See also: U.S. Court Orders SEC to Respond to Coinbase's Allegations  In other words, bog-standard surveillance and information disclosure rules seen across financial markets, and codified into law for crypto companies that want to do business in the European Union under the recently passed MiCA regulations.  ""Coinbase's alleged failures deprive investors of critical protections, including rulebooks that prevent fraud and manipulation, proper disclosure, safeguards against conflicts of interest, and routine inspection,"" Gensler said in a tweet.  Why the rules may not work  To be sure, there are serious reasons why such reporting rules are anthema culturally in the crypto industry (which tends to value financial privacy and sovereignty quite highly), and why at a technological level either introduce risks for crypto users or are legitimately unneeded. Any disclosure on a blockchain is total disclosure, opening up a user’s entire history of transactions to view by nature of how blockchains work.  [I]t’d clearly be better if founders and companies knew in advance how to operate within the bounds of the law.  More importantly, there is also a fair argument that cryptocurrency networks have in-built systems for customer protection – or, at the very least, are optimizing for a different understanding of “safety” as financial regulators.  For crypto, what’s truly important is to offer equal access to all potential users while also ensuring that these new forms of money are non-confiscatable and their transactions irreversible. The open-ledger design also provides a complete view for authorities to track down bad actors when necessary, which is now standard practice.  That blockchains accomplish all this does not eliminate the need for regulations. And it’d clearly be better if founders and companies knew in advance how to operate within the bounds of the law. But crypto’s very real neutrality and technical achievements does put it in conflict with some regulatory aims, as argued in a recent “Consensus @ Consensus” report titled Should DeFi [decentralized finance] Defy Regulators?  This includes the “commodity-money” aspects of many tokens that have use in a decentralized system and utility beyond mere speculation. It also includes the programmatic circuit-breakers in DeFi lending markets, the pre-established rules that all necessarily follow when they engage with a smart contract.  When is it worth defying?  What’s true for pure decentralized systems does not necessarily apply to centralized companies like Coinbase and Binance, however. It’s difficult to predict the results of these recent lawsuits – and they are likely to play out for years – but the scope of the allegations does suggest the SEC is looking to totally, irrevocably reshape how crypto functions. Liquidity is already being drained out of Binance, which, even before the lawsuit, was seeing multi-year low transaction volumes.  Some predict such a hostile move will bottom out the domestic U.S. crypto industry. Others that it may usher in an age for truly decentralized finance and decentralized exchanges. It’s worth noting that allegations are not facts, and some degree of skepticism is warranted given Gensler’s clear bias. In the past, the SEC’s enforcement actions have led to slaps on the wrist.  What is certain is that exchanges – if they want to benefit from the efficiencies and protections of operating as “centralized” companies – will need to start acting a lot more like fintech firms and banks. That means more KYC [know-your-customer rules], more disclosures and more interactions with regulators. It’s why some think the real future of crypto exchanges isn't DeFi, but exchanges like FTX 2.0, a bankrupt company that would have every incentive to play by the rules.  It remains to be seen what the ""v2"" versons of Coinbase and Binance might be.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/06/06/are-centralized-exchanges-in-the-us-doomed,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/32d9fcec8e42e86e754c63e49f2f67c6a6788d7b-2879x1525.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410473,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdX43f,1686068107,How to Build a Compliant Crypto Exchange Post-Coinbase,"I developed something of a reputation for being a skeptic about the legal propriety of selling cryptocurrency tokens in the United States. I used to write about this extensively, particularly in 2017 when I was studying for my master's in law and, accordingly, had more free time and latitude to say what I wanted.  Moreover, I held this position when it was unpopular and non-obvious, unlike the recent crop of crypto critics like former government lawyer John Reed Stark (who seems to take endless glee in kicking the industry while it’s down). See, for example, on July 9th, 2014, when my friend Tim Swanson and I were quoted in a CoinTelegraph article, “Mitigating the Legal Risks of Issuing Securities on a Cryptoledger,” when I said that “[Virtually] nobody has done this correctly. To date I have not seen a single crypto-security that has been properly structured.”  Preston Byrne is a lawyer and partner of Brown Rudnick’s Digital Commerce Group.  People thought I was crazy at the time. Others probably thought I was just a jerk. The truth is probably somewhere between the two. Keep in mind, of course, that in 2014 the idea of an “initial coin offering” (ICO) didn’t really exist; entrepreneurs like Joel Dietz marketed his “Swarm” crowdfunding token as “crypto-equity,” a term which fell into disfavor by more sophisticated projects like Ethereum which, only a month after I was quoted in the CoinTelegraph article, launched its ICO. But even that wasn’t called an ICO. That, presumably per whatever advice was given to Joe Lubin by his lawyers, was a “sale of crypto fuel for the Ethereum network.” Or as the New York Attorney General alleged in its recent lawsuit against KuCoin, a security.  Ethereum subsequently exploded in 2017 and with it came a thousand imitators and other variations just like it. U.S. regulators were slow to respond. Then-SEC Director Bill Hinman added fuel to the ICO fire when made his famous “Hinman speech” which set out the (now-discredited) “sufficiently decentralized” exception to the Howey test. Keeping in mind that Hinman was based out of San Francisco, the general assumption among those of us who were not in the cool SF venture-capitalist crowd was that they had successfully convinced that office that Ethereum – a popular investment out there – was the next Internet and the best thing for the government to do would be to get out of the way and let Ethereum prove it.  I think it is safe to say, five years later, that Ethereum has not cracked a lot of the scaling issues it would have needed to do to become the next Internet. With those broken promises on one side, perhaps it is not surprising that the government has decided to restore the status quo ante, with the NYAG’s lawsuit against KuCoin.  Confusion and weird settlements  What followed the Hinman speech can only be described as confusing. Until the Hinman speech, the SEC really had only gotten involved in the crypto business in cases of obvious and notorious fraud. The first such case that I can recall was the case of SEC vs. Trendon Shavers and Bitcoin Savings and Trust(a Ponzi scheme) and SEC v. GAW Miners, Joshua Homero Garza et al.(another Ponzi scheme involving the sale of “mining contracts” and a $20 stablecoin called “paycoin”).  In terms of non-fraud enforcement, the SEC started to bring its first set of enforcement actions, announced by way of settlements, with a number of coin-related projects in late 2018, only months after the Hinman speech was published. The first such settlement, with a founder of early decentralized exchange, or “DEX,” EtherDelta, was announced on Nov. 8, 2018; the SEC claimed that DEX was operating an unregistered exchange, which necessarily implied that the SEC took the view that some of the assets on EtherDelta – being Ether and ERC-20s – were securities. Ten days later, the SEC announced its first settlements with two otherwise completely unmemorable ICO issues, Airfox and Paragon; both respondents agreed to register their tokens as securities (which does not appear to have happened as far as I can tell).  What followed over the next year was a range of weird settlements which failed to serve as a deterrent to further ICO issuance being conducted at the same time as a bunch of weird transactions which tried to pretzel their way into compliance with the non-guidance guidance issued by Bill Hinman. EOS, for example, which advertised its product on a giant Times Square billboard during Consensus 2017 and raised north of $4 billion in crypto (as valued at the time), was somehow allowed to skate by paying a $24 million fine – and not even a requirement to register!  Other projects were not so lucky. Kik Interactive, Telegram, and Ripple Labs launched absolutely gargantuan ICOs; both Kik and Telegram lost badly in federal court, and I do not rate Ripple’s chances. Similarly the much-smaller LBRY project, based in New Hampshire and which pre-dated EOS by some years, was not, as far as I am aware, offered a settlement deal with the SEC which would have permitted their business to continue operating; the only logical reason I have been able to deduce for this is that the SEC’s Boston office wanted a scalp and the only place you’ll find a crypto startup in New England is in New Hampshire.  No surprises  This brings us to the Coinbase complaint. Nothing about it will come as a surprise to any attorney who has been practicing in the U.S. after 2018.  The charges alleged are numerous. The SEC accuses Coinbase of violating the registration requirement of the Securities Act of 1933 in relation to its custodial staking offering.  It also charges Coinbase with violating the Exchange Act’s registration requirements, which require anyone effecting transactions in securities to register and be supervised by the Commission. Furthermore, Coinbase is charged with operating as an unregistered broker-dealer and with operating as an unregistered clearing agency, being “any person who acts as an intermediary in making payments or deliveries or both in connection with transactions in securities or… provides facilities for comparison of data respecting the terms of settlement of securities transactions.”  I am not going to bore you by quoting chapter and verse on broker-dealer registration requirements. I also won’t go into a detailed Howey analysis on many of the coins mentioned in the complaint – including Solana, ADA, Matic, Filecoin, SAND, AXS, CHZ, FLOW, ICP, NEAR, VGX, DASH, and NEXO. The important thing here is that the SEC is seeking, as a remedy, a permanent injunction against Coinbase from operating an unlicensed exchange. If they can get one of the tokens to stick and win at trial, they may be able to shut down Coinbase’s core business completely.  What did surprise me is that it took this long. Back in 2017, I hypothesized that one day there would come an event – one I referred to as when law enforcement would launch something akin to “simultaneous dawn raids at the major exchanges and the homes and offices of the major ICO promoters, with a variety of agencies in a variety of countries co-ordinating their activities.” It’s hard to tell whether we’re at the beginning of a process that extensive, but if the SEC is going after Coinbase, no one in Coinbase’s business is safe. I called that event “The Zombie Marmot Apocalypse,” said it was massively bearish for crypto and I think it is safe to say that it is now upon us.  What now?  The question then turns to what comes next. Crypto isn’t going anywhere, so I think the answer is “new exchanges that aren’t carrying all this regulatory baggage.” In terms of how that might look, here’s my current thinking:  Paradoxically, there is probably no better time – other than 2012 – to start a crypto exchange than today. For the first time since perhaps the start of Bitcoin itself, compliance will cost less than non-compliance. Existing industry giants have a lot of legal-technical debt they need to work through which will distract them and cost enormous amounts of money.  Crypto is not going to die. In places where it is growing most quickly, particularly Latin America and Africa, there is neither the political will nor the harmonized enforcement capacity to shut it down.  Making companies like Coinbase treat crypto tokens as old-fashioned securities is like trying to regulate Starlink like we regulate road traffic. Equally, expecting the U.S. government to simply just let crypto happen was not realistic. Increased lobbying efforts and an openness to compromise by U.S. crypto giants will result in a middle path in the U.S. which will regularize crypto business within the next five years if not sooner.  The companies that will succeed will have a growth strategy which doesn’t include the United States, and will then need to be ready to move to the United States on hair-trigger alert once regulations are favorable – or, in the alternative, they’ll need to develop a subsidiary that operates like INX and gets the appropriate regulatory approvals. I suspect that regulations will eventually loosen up so that companies like INX can operate more like companies like Coinbase and Gemini do today. To achieve scale, startups will need to build a toehold in countries with substantial populations of English-speaking crypto users that don’t ban ICOs and permit exchanges to trade spot crypto without regulating them as broker-dealers or clearing agencies.  The only G20 country I can think of that satisfies these criteria is the United Kingdom. The UK should be used as a launching point to access English-speaking Africa and India while the U.S. gets its act together and (likely) has a change in presidential administrations to one that doesn’t want to completely eliminate avenues of escape from the dollar.  So. Crypto’s not dead, it’s just in need of a little legal tune-up. May the best and most compliant startup win.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Preston J.

13185012,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=536674,1686067209,"Bitcoin Slips Below $26,000, Triggers Over $300 Million In Liquidations","The cryptocurrency market experienced a significant jolt as Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, slipped below its previously plateaued threshold of $26,000. This downward movement has led to a surge in total liquidations, with traders losing more than $300 million within a span of 24 hours. The repercussions of this event are reverberating throughout the market, with major exchanges recording substantial liquidation figures. Record Liquidations Hit The Market The crypto market has been shaken by a surge in liquidations as Bitcoin faltered, prompting a domino effect of positions being forcefully closed. According to data from Coinglass, roughly 112,837 traders were liquidated in the past 24 hours, resulting in a cumulative loss of $304 million and counting. Among the exchanges involved, Binance took the lead in liquidations with $100.4 million, closely followed by OKX at $80.62 million. Although other exchanges also witnessed liquidations, their impact was comparatively lesser. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) Dominance Trend Shifts Alongside Stablecoin Flows: Glassnode In the wake of Bitcoin’s dip, long positions bore the brunt of the liquidations, accounting for approximately $277.45 million (91.22%) of the total. This reflects the overwhelming presence of traders who had anticipated a price increase. Simultaneously, short positions also faced liquidations, amounting to approximately $26.71 million or nearly 10% of the total. The volatility of the market proved detrimental to both sides of the trading spectrum. Amid the widespread liquidations, one trader stands out for enduring the largest single liquidation. A trader on Bitmex recorded a massive loss of $9.94 million in an XBTUSD swap, underscoring the magnitude of the market upheaval. Additionally, Bitcoin liquidations alone accounted for $105.54 million, while Ethereum (ETH) witnessed liquidations totaling $33.87 million, further highlighting the far-reaching implications of this event. Bitcoin Slips Below $30,000 The global crypto market cap also slumped below the previously established $1.2 trillion mark with a value of $1.133 trillion at the time of writing, down by nearly 3.7% in the last 24 hours. The plunge comes after the ongoing negativity in the market such as the thrown-around lawsuit by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The news impacted Bitcoin significantly as the asset has lost more than $20 billion from its market cap in the past 24 hours and is down by nearly 5%, indicating possible violent selling pressure. Though the top crypto saw a slight uptrend on Sunday, it has seen a bearish trend since then. Meanwhile, at the time of writing, BTC currently trades below $26,000 with a 24-hour trading volume of $21 billion. An increase from the previously recorded daily trading volume of $11 billion seen last week Tuesday. Related Reading: No All-Time High For Bitcoin In 2023, Former BitMEX Head Arthur Hayes Predicts It is important to highlight that amidst the substantial liquidations, certain traders managed to capitalize on the market movement by strategically shorting their positions.

42410475,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdX4AH,1686067204,Lightning Data Analytics Firm Amboss Launches New ‘Liner’ Index for Bitcoin Yield,"Generating yield on Bitcoin’s Lightning Network is fiendishly complex, but the data analytics firm Amboss says its new Lightning Network Rate (Liner) simplifies the process by providing key insights into yield opportunities on the network.  Lightning is a second-layer payment network for cheaper and faster bitcoin (BTC) transactions that requires users to acquire liquidity – the ability to send and receive payments – by first committing bitcoin to a payment channel.  Read more: Solving Lightning’s ‘Inbound Liquidity’ Problem Is Focus of New Layer 2 Bitcoin Protocol, Ark  Service providers on the network will commit funds, open payment channels and temporarily lease excess liquidity to users for a fee, thereby generating yield on their committed funds.  To maximize that yield, service provider nodes must ensure they match with other nodes capable of maximizing transaction volume, maintaining round-the-clock availability (offline nodes cannot route payments), and providing liquidity for a set time period. This matching process can already be done on Amboss’s liquidity marketplace Magma, which launched last year, and now the firm says Liner will be the marketplace’s benchmark rate for measuring bitcoin returns on committed capital.  “Liner is a way to generate yield without giving up custody,” said Jesse Shrader, CEO and co-founder of Amboss in an interview with CoinDesk. “People gave their bitcoin to Celsius and gave it to BlockFi and now have nothing to show for it. We're promising yields on their bitcoin. Folks made the mistake of trusting another platform to hold that for them, but that's not necessary with Lightning. ”  Amboss didn’t pioneer the liquidity marketplace, nor did it pioneer the concept of a benchmark rate. Lightning infrastructure firm Lightning Labs launched Lightning Pool in 2020, almost two years before Amboss. Lightning Pool aggregates supply and demand of liquidity, allowing buyers to submit bids for that liquidity via a sealed-bid auction, while also generating a “current lease rate” for capital similar to Liner.  According to author and investor Jonathan Bier’s book Reckless: The Story Of Cryptocurrency Interest Rates, Lightning Pool had double the volume of Magma circa November 2022. A quick look at each platform's metrics at the time of reporting shows a lifetime volume of 110 BTC since launch for Magma (which went live in early 2022) and annual volume of just under 10 BTC for Lightning Pool (which doesn't display lifetime volume).  “We operate a liquidity marketplace. If you want to buy a channel from anybody that has an offer listed, you can go and do that and compare the prices,” said Shrader. “That's one piece of it, just provisioning this liquidity. On the other side, the person that's providing the liquidity, they get some yield out of it.”  Adding Liner to Magma will allow liquidity providers to determine whether committing their capital will be worth their while. Similarly, purchasers of liquidity will be able to determine the cost of leasing channel capacity. LINER Yield will cater to liquidity providers while LINER Cost will target those seeking liquidity.  Magma currently shows yields ranging from roughly 2% to 3%. It’s important to note that these are what Shrader calls “self-custodial yields,” meaning returns are only generated from the provisioning of liquidity without any bitcoin changing hands.

After the US imposed sanctions against the mixing services, Tornado Cash continued to operate while Blender ceased its operations and disappeared after reportedly taking $22 million in Bitcoin from the mixer. According to Elliptic, Blender likely started operating the new service called Sinbad, which Lazarus used to launder illicit funds in October 2022.

The round also saw participation from venture firms Robot Ventures, Anagram, Dispersion Capital, Web3 developer backend Alchemy and a handful of individual investors including former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan.  In addition, Argus is announcing the World Engine, a blockchain-gaming software developer kit (SDK) that will allow builders to create their own Web3 gaming ecosystems.  Scott Sunarto, CEO of Argus, told CoinDesk that the company aims to not only build the blockchain infrastructure to support emerging Web3 games but also to support developers in expanding their visions.  “Computer games in the 1980s and ‘90s were building their engine to build their own game … I think we're at a very similar stage in crypto gaming right now, where if you really want to build great applications for great content, you really need to have this ability to push the envelope yourself,” said Sunarto. “That's really why we’re this engine infrastructure team and a content game studio built in-house.”  Sunarto said that Argus plans to use the funding to scale the team and build out its studio and tooling infrastructure.  Breck Stodghill, the Haun Ventures investor who led the round, told CoinDesk that he sees Sunarto as a “missionary” in his efforts to spearhead growth in the greater Web3 gaming space.  “He believes first and foremost that the power of games to unite folks and the power of crypto is something that should be put together if we can figure out some of the infrastructure problems,” said Stodghill. “If we can create fertile ground for game developers to have crypto as a tool, there'll be some really interesting new games that emerge – and it'll end up being super positive for the people who play games.”  After a bear market that slowed investment across the entire Web3 industry, funding rounds for blockchain-based games have started to pick up again.

The study potentially represents the first probe of its kind into the economics of Web3.  The government of the European Union member – which is a significant financial center despite its small size – has said it sees the technology underpinning crypto as key to the digital and environmental transition.  “Given the strong potential of the sector, it’s important to ensure that Web3 actors can develop in a market that is effective and competitive,” the Autorité de la concurrence said in a statement.  Competition market studies collect information from companies active in the sector about how a particular market works, and can be the basis for further enforcement actions for breaches of antitrust rules such as abuse of a dominant position.  This study will examine where and how newer blockchain-based companies compete with existing Web2 internet companies, and document potential anti-competitive practices implemented against Web3 projects, the regulator said.  Thibaut Schrepel, an associate professor at the University of Amsterdam who will help with with the probe as external expert, told CoinDesk the project may break new ground.  “To the best of my knowledge, it’s the first market study conducted by a regulatory agency whose goal is to protect Web3, not to attack it,” Schrepel said.  The European Commission is set to issue a policy paper on the metaverse later this year, which is expected to consider options if major companies such as Meta Platforms (META) squeeze out smaller rivals.

42410480,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdX4U7,1686064920,"Genesis Bankruptcy Judge Extends Mediation Period Between Genesis, Creditors","NEW YORK — U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Sean Lane extended a mediation period between crypto lender Genesis and its creditors at a Monday bankruptcy hearing as tensions flared over the role Genesis’ parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG) would play in the lender's restructuring.  The mediation period, slated to end last month, will now conclude on June 16. Judge Lane appointed a mediator to steer talks between the insolvent lender and its creditors on May 1 after previous discussions between the parties broke down earlier this year. Digital Currency Group is the parent company to CoinDesk.  “There's lots of different kinds of conversations that have to happen in connection with [bankruptcies],” Judge Lane said during the hearing. “The challenge always, of course, is that you can't negotiate everything all at once.”  The judge's order to extend the mediation period frustrated some of Genesis creditors, including the lender’s former business partner, crypto exchange Gemini. Genesis filed for bankruptcy in January in the Southern District of New York.  Legal representatives for Gemini argued that prolonging talks between the case’s players could inflict greater financial harm on those most impacted by the bankruptcy.  “Gemini urges all the parties as we know to keep in mind that each delay has actual people separated from their investments,” said Anson Frelinghuysen, a partner at Hughes Hubbard & Reed's who represents Gemini. “Gemini's patience, just like the patients of its Earn users, is wearing thin.”  Centralized cryptocurrency exchange Gemini froze withdrawals from accounts tied to its crypto lending product Gemini Earn last November after Genesis shuttered its operations following the multi-billion dollar collapse of one of its borrowers, crypto exchange FTX.  Gemini Earn customers, who have suffered as a result of Genesis’ financial woes, also chimed in during the hearing to bemoan the judge’s decision to extend the case’s mediation period.  “We don't have the luxury of litigating endlessly,” Clinton Mueller, a Gemini Earn customer, said during the hearing. “This [case] has real world implications to our homes and our families.”  While sympathetic to the troubles of Genesis’ creditors, Judge Lane challenged their assumptions that the timeline of the mediation process would drag out the court's proceedings.  “Shortening the mediation does not shorten the case,” Judge Lane said. “Furthering the mediation tends to further prompt resolution of the case.”  During the hearing, Judge Lane also shot down requests to open the settlement talks to bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, which alleges Genesis owes it $3.9 billion. He instead gave the case's parties more time to formulate a revised proposal that would guide payouts to hundreds of thousands of Genesis creditors.  Genesis, for its part, alleges it does not owe FTX any money at all. The lender has requested the case's judge estimate the exact amount FTX is owed, which will be considered at next week's hearing.

42410478,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdX4KC,1686063540,How the Metaverse May Revolutionize the Creator Economy,"The emerging Web3 ecosystem aims to transform the way creators engage with their audiences and build business models. While Web1 was read-only, Web2 opened the doors for user-generated “write” content and created the framework for robust digital interactions. Web3, if it works as envisioned, will expand on these foundations by allowing internet users to read, write and own their data, moving power away from centralized entities and toward individual users.  This new vision of the internet puts privacy, decentralization and ownership at the forefront and focuses on restoring choice and agency. Yet, many of these ideals have been stifled by messy execution and stubborn power structures that continue to manage our digital behaviors. And as developers and users strive for an open metaverse – a shared, decentralized, immersive digital realm – questions about proprietorship and interoperability remain.  This article is excerpted from CoinDesk’s inaugural Consensus @ Consensus Report, the product of intimate, curated group discussions that took place at Consensus 2023. Click here to download the full report.  Further, of the 168 Consensus attendees who answered an electronic survey, participants were split on who will actually own the metaverse: 40% voted that megacorporations like Meta will take charge, while another 40% voted that everyone or no one will lay claim to a unified digital world. Only 19% of participants believed that early adopters with skin in the game would own the metaverse.

Global ESG-related assets under management (AUM) are projected to reach $33.9 trillion by 2026, constituting 21.5% of total global AUM, according to a late-2022 report from PricewaterhouseCoopers.  To put it simply: If blockchain companies want to get that next institutional dollar, there needs to be an ESG direction.

Click here to download the full report.  While there are some in the crypto industry that want to dismiss ESG entirely as a contraption too difficult to work with, participants in a roundtable discussion at Consensus were optimistic, with the theme being how to embrace ESG and not hide from it.  For some, the most obvious and easy solution is encouraging the adoption of proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms, which see users pledge their assets to become transaction validators. (Just over half of the 165 Consensus attendees who answered an electronic survey voted that this was the best option for addressing climate change.)  “Proof-of-work versus proof-of-stake is just going to fly over the heads of many in Washington,” one Consensus attendee, who had prior professional experience in the U.S. capitol, said during the discussion. “The first step to get this right is for blockchain to be used as a utility to solve real-world problems.”  See also: Could Bitcoin Be the Greatest ESG Investment of All Time? | Opinion  Though attendees were far from consensus on key issues like whether blockchains should ditch the carbon-intensive “mining” process, there was alignment on the disconnect between the crypto industry and regulators.

The shares slid as much as 20% at the open before retracing some of the loss to trade 15% lower at $47.10 as of 10:07 a.m. in New York (14:07 UTC), according to TradingView prices. Major shareholders of Coinbase include The Vanguard Group, Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest, Nikko Asset Management, Fidelity and BlackRock.  In March, Ark Invest added an additional 301,437 shares of Coinbase to its ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK). The funds held a total of about 11 million shares as of Monday, according to data on the ARK Invest website.  The SEC said Coinbase was operating as an unregistered broker, exchange and clearing agency simultaneously, accusing it of soliciting customers, handling orders, allowing for bids and acting as an intermediary all at once.  “The legal fight will be long and costly for Coinbase, but it might be difficult to argue and prove that they didn't commingle and unlawfully offer exchange, broker-dealer, and clearinghouse functions,” Edward Moya, a senior markets analyst at Oanda, said.  The suit comes a day after the SEC sued Binance, the biggest crypto exchange globally, for similar reasons. Coinbase shares lost 9% on Monday. Brokerage platform Robinhood Markets (HOOD) also fell, losing 3%; the company reported first-quarter cryptocurrency trading revenue of $38 million.

In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, Gensler denied claims his approach was muddying the legal position around crypto, and also suggested there were parallels between his case against Binance Chief Executive Officer Changpeng “CZ” Zhao and the criminal case against FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried.  “We don’t need more digital currency… we already have digital currency, it’s called the U.S. dollar,” Gensler said. “We have not seen, over the centuries, that economies and the public need more than one way to move value.”  The SEC sued Binance on Monday, and Coinbase on Tuesday, for offering services such as brokerage and clearing on allegedly regulated securities.  Gensler will seek to prove that the thousands of tokens tradeable on two of the biggest crypto venues resemble investment contracts that should have been registered with his agency, rather than mere means of payment. “All we have to show is that one of them is a security, and they should be properly registered,” he said.  “There’s been clarity for years,” about the nature of securities law, Gensler added, brushing off concerns that crypto firms have been left facing uncertain enforcement. “These intermediaries need to come into compliance.”  Gensler said that Binance affiliate Sigma Chain “boosted the volumes and corrupted the numbers because of the lack of controls,” adding that the public can “draw the parallels as you wish” with the case of Bankman-Fried, who is currently awaiting trial for charges including fraud, to which he has pleaded not guilty.  Gensler doubled down on those comments during a Bloomberg TV interview later on Tuesday.  ""There's parallels here to the FTX fraud manipulation that we saw and [what the U.S. has alleged] against Sam Bankman-Fried, where he had a sister organization, Alameda, and the special arrangements with that trading platform FTX,"" Gensler told Bloomberg TV.  He added, ""You see platform after platform [where] the entrepreneurs behind the platform[s] also are trying to build wealth for themselves and their investors, [whether] through sister organizations, hedge funds, trading against the customers or even even as it relates to...dealing against their customers.""  Gensler noted that the crypto industry needed to improve its compliance and disclosure ""if it's going to have any success going forward.""  ""Without that this whole area stands at chances of collapsing like a house of cards,"" Gensler said on Bloomberg TV.  The SEC's suit does not allege fraud by Zhao, but asks for civil penalties alongside a permanent ban on him acting as an officer or director of any securities issuer.

The Bermuda Monetary Authority-licensed company said it raised the funds across two seed rounds. The first was co-led by Sam Altman, CEO of ChatGPT developer OpenAI, and former Stripe executive Lachy Groom. The second was led by Gradient Ventures. Meanwhile was previously called Standard Crypto Insurance, and is registered under that name with the BMA, CEO Zac Townsend told CoinDesk.  Meanwhile plans to use the funding to hire a development team for its first product, according to an emailed announcement on Tuesday. Its initial target audience is U.S. citizens with large BTC holdings who are looking to protect their families in a tax-advantaged way, an audience from which Townsend said the firm has ""seen a lot of early demand.""  ""It makes perfect sense for long-term holders of BTC to invest in life insurance denominated in that asset, and to enable a percentage of their BTC holdings to become active,” Townsend said.  The company plans to use AI to help with underwriting, claims and operations, according to the statement.  Townsend said the volatility typically associated with the bitcoin price isn't a concern for Meanwhile.  ""Market moves that impact the price of BTC do not impact our underwriting or our guarantees because we take premiums and pay out claims in BTC,"" he said. ""We think hundreds of millions of folks will be onboarding into the bitcoin economy in the coming decades, and we’re building the life insurance company for them.""  While the insurer may be relatively immune to bitcoin fluctuations, policyholders will be shouldering some of the risk because price changes will determine the value of their payouts.  ""Today’s price, tomorrow’s price, that doesn’t matter. What matters is BTC being valuable in the long-term future,"" Townsend said.

13182910,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/optimism-gears-up-for-bedrock-mainnet-update,1686060000,Optimism Gears Up For Bedrock Mainnet Update,"Optimism, the Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution, is preparing to roll out its ""Bedrock"" upgrade today, June 6th. The step is considered to be a significant leap towards becoming a utility-oriented ""Superchain"" featuring reduced gas fees and significantly faster transaction finality and block rendering. The Ethereum-based protocol's vision of its technological progress towards becoming a Superchain, which is to say an interconnected network of interoperable and highly composable blockchains, is getting nearer through these planned enhancements. Optimism Bedrock Update The Bedrock update is expected to go live by 16:00 UTC today via Optimism's mainnet.“Bedrock was named Bedrock for a reason. It is the foundation for the Superchain,"" shares Karl Floersch. Floersch currently serves as CEO and and is co-founder at OP Labs, the development organization behind Optimism and its suite of blockchain products.The move is considered an instrumental point towards the transformation of Optimism. With the upgrade, all associated and integrated chains either constructed within or designed in alignment with the OP tech stack (developer tooling, APIs, and SDKs) will be linked over, enabling smooth communication over a unified ecosystem. Floersche emphasizes further that the ""Superchain"" status isn't a mere moniker, it is, in essence, a long-term vision towards producing an industry standard with the OP Stack as a baseline. Among the key features outlined in anticipation of the upgrade is a 40% reduction in gas fees through an optimized data compression strategy. This means that Bedrock is set to introduce internal mechanisms that will curtail the reliance towards block reorganization, which costs a significant amount of resources on the side of a Layer 2 chain such as Optimism. Block-based reorganizations (reorgs) are instances in which a blockchain simultaneously produces two blocks, hence generating a duplicate blockchain. The code changes set out in Bedrock will effectively cut down confirmation intervals for deposits to approximately 60 seconds, down from the average interval of 600 seconds for the same typical transaction. Key Enhancements To Expect On Optimism Bedrock Update Another well-intentioned upgrade that comes with the Bedrock update is slew of enhancements to proof of modularity in the OP Stack. This open-source toolkit provides developers with functionalities for providing customizable environments on the Optimism blockchain, opening constructs and experiences for users who wish to leverage validity proofs and fault proofs within the OP Stack. Alongside the transaction upgrades, this feature set wil provide a performance boost for node-related functions across the Optimism ecosystem. Another significant advancement Bedrock brings to the table is facilitating Optimism's transition to a multi-client ecosystem. Floersch claims that Optimism will be the first layer 2 protocol to boast multiple clients, thereby enhancing system resilience by eliminating potential single points of failure. Client software is utilized to operate the blockchain, with layer 1 blockchains like Ethereum relying on several clients to ensure network security. The upgrade process is expected to last between two to four hours. During this period, deposits and withdrawals will be temporarily suspended, and the chain will be momentarily paused. What is Optimism? Optimism functions as a scaling solution for Ethereum, allowing users to carry out transactions on the blockchain at a lower cost while retaining the underlying security of Ethereum. It utilizes a technology called an “optimistic rollup,” which consolidates multiple transactions into a single transaction, consequently accelerating transaction speed and reducing gas fees. The layer 2 landscape atop Ethereum has witnessed stiff competition in recent months. L2Beat statistics indicate that Optimism's closest rival, Arbitrum, leads the pack with a total value locked (TVL) of $5.69 billion, with Optimism trailing with a TVL of $1.68 billion. The Bedrock upgrade, however, is expected to boost Optimism's competitiveness. Alternative solutions to optimistic rollups, like ZK Rollups, have also been gaining traction. Polygon and Matter Labs recently introduced their zkEVMs, a type of ZK Rollup compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, providing users with more choices for faster, cheaper transactions on Ethereum.

On Tuesday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in its relentless pursuit of the crypto industry, sued crypto exchange Coinbase in a New York federal court. The agency alleges the exchange acted as an unregistered broker and exchange and is demanding that the firm be “permanently restrained and enjoined” from further doing so. The complaint comes less than a day after the agency sued Binance and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao. SEC: Coinbase Is an Unregistered Exchange, Broker, and Clearing Agency In a press release, the securities regulator said Coinbase acted as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency and charged it for “the unregistered offer and sale of securities in connection with its staking-as-a-service program.” The SEC details: Since 2019, Coinbase has been engaging in an unregistered securities offering through its staking-as-a-service program, which allows customers to earn profits from the “proof of stake” mechanisms of certain blockchains and Coinbase’s efforts. Through its unregistered services, the agency said Coinbase allegedly: Provides a marketplace and brings together the orders for securities of multiple buyers and sellers using established, non-discretionary methods under which such orders interact. Further, it states that Coinbase: Engages in the business of effecting securities transactions for the accounts of Coinbase customers. Finally, the SEC alleges that Coinbase: Provides facilities for comparison of data respecting the terms of settlement of crypto asset securities transactions, serves as an intermediary in settling transactions in crypto asset securities by Coinbase customers, and acts as a securities depository. The regulator further deems at least 13 crypto assets available to Coinbase users as “crypto asset securities”. Gensler and Grewal Comment Chairman of the SEC, Gary Gensler, took to Twitter to share the news. Gensler commented: Coinbase’s alleged failures deprive investors of critical protections, including rulebooks that prevent fraud and manipulation, proper disclosure, safeguards against conflicts of interest, and routine inspection by the SEC. Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement, Gurbir S. Grewal, had this to say: You simply can’t ignore the rules because you don’t like them or because you’d prefer different ones: the consequences for the investing public are far too great. As alleged in our complaint, Coinbase was fully aware of the applicability of the federal securities laws to its business activities, but deliberately refused to follow them. While Coinbase’s calculated decisions may have allowed it to earn billions, it’s done so at the expense of investors by depriving them of the protections to which they are entitled. Today’s action seeks to hold Coinbase accountable for its choices. The SEC Appears to be Out for Blood The crypto market has been in free fall since news broke that the agency filed suit against crypto exchange Binance and its founder and CEO, Changpeng Zhao. The agency accused Binance of mishandling funds and lying to investors and regulators about its operations. Binance responded by denying the claims. Coinbase has been under the radar amid the SEC’s broader crackdown on unregistered securities. After the SEC and crypto exchange Kraken reached a settlement earlier in the year where the company agreed to shutter its staking program, Coinbase said they would defend the agency’s classification of staking as a security. Coinbase executives claim that staking cannot be classified as a security under the US Securities Act or the Howey Test. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Coinbase has 28 days to explain to the Alabama Securities Commission (ASC) how it is not violating state securities laws with its staking program, the regulator said on Tuesday. The California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) has meanwhile filed for an order for Coinbase to ""desist and refrain from the further offer and sale of securities in California,"" while Maryland ordered Coinbase to cease and desist the offering.  The DFPI said it ""has issued no permit or other form of qualification authorizing Coinbase to offer or sell securities, including the Coinbase Staking Offerings, in California. Nor are the offers and sales of these securities excepted, exempt, or otherwise not subject to qualification.""  The action comes after Coinbase was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission earlier on Tuesday for the alleged sale of unregistered securities, a day after the regulator took similar action against Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by market cap.  In addition to Alabama and California, the task force of states moving against the crypto company includes Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, South Carolina, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.  The ASC's ""show cause"" order alleges Coinbase and its parent corporation Coinbase Global broke the law by offering the staking rewards program ""Earn"" to state residents, and the regulator wants the entities to show ""why they should not be directed to cease and desist from selling unregistered securities in Alabama.""  The ASC action doesn't forbid Coinbase from offering staking as a service as long as it complies with the law, but the order itself was the result of a task force of 10 state securities regulators in the U.S., namely Alabama, California, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, South Carolina, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.  “The ASC is committed to protecting Alabama consumers and investors, including those who choose to invest in the decentralized finance space. This action is another step toward ensuring that investors in crypto asset products are offered the same protections under our laws and are fully aware of the risks involved in these investments,” said ASC Director Amanda Senn in a press statement.  Maryland's order gives Coinbase 15 days to respond to the Securities Commissioner.  The ASC issued a similar order to now-bankrupt crypto lender Celsius back in 2021, also suspected of violating state securities laws with its ""Earn Rewards"" program.

13182172,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=536465,1686057696,Bitcoin (BTC) Dominance Trend Shifts Alongside Stablecoin Flows: Glassnode,"Amid the continuous downward trend in the global crypto market, leading on-chain analytics firm Glassnode yesterday reported some significant movement recorded in the Bitcoin (BTC) and Stablecoin markets. According to Glassnode, the dominance of Bitcoin and stablecoin flows have seen “dramatic shifts” over the years. Changes In Bitcoin Supply Ownership In a series of tweets posted earlier today, Glassnode released a recent report shedding light on the evolving landscape of Bitcoin supply ownership and the dynamics surrounding stablecoins. Related Reading: No All-Time High For Bitcoin In 2023, Former BitMEX Head Arthur Hayes Predicts The findings reveal significant shifts in the dominance of Bitcoin supply and the distribution of stablecoin holdings, indicating changing investor behaviors and potential migration of liquidity towards lower-risk digital assets. According to Glassnode’s report, the dominance of BTC supply has witnessed a noteworthy transformation over the past two years. US entities now hold 11% less Bitcoin than in June 2022, while investors active during Asian trading hours have increased their holdings by 9.9%. This reversal of fortunes represents a distinct departure from the trends observed during the 2020-2021 bull cycle, signifying a shift in market dynamics and investor preferences. Stablecoin Dynamics And Changing Market Sentiment Glassnode’s report also highlights significant developments in the stablecoin space. The supply of USDT (Tether) has reached all-time highs, indicating a surge in demand for this popular stablecoin. In contrast, the supplies of USDC (USD Coin) and BUSD (Binance USD) have declined to multi-year lows. This divergence suggests that non-interest-bearing stablecoins, such as USDT, are attracting more attention and capital, potentially due to their utility in trading and liquidity provision. Related Reading: Tether: How Its $2 Billion USDT Minting Impacts Ethereum’s Success In The Bull Market Furthermore, Glassnode’s analysis of on-chain flows reveals a decline in demand since April. While stablecoin inflows had significantly outweighed Bitcoin and Ethereum inflows in the first quarter, the market correction has led to a reversal in this trend. Glassnode now observes larger BTC and Ethereum inflows, possibly indicating sell-side activities as market participants adjust their positions in response to the evolving landscape. These findings collectively suggest a net capital rotation and the migration of liquidity towards lower-risk digital assets. Glassnode’s data aligns with the observation that BTC futures trade volumes are increasingly dominating the market, surpassing Ethereum and other digital assets in 2023. The recent increase in Bitcoin’s volume dominance, surpassing 65%, supports the notion that Bitcoin is perceived as a relatively lower-risk digital asset within the digital asset realm. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has witnessed a dramatic plunge in the past week and in the past 24 hours. The largest crypto asset by market capitalization has recorded a bearish movement down by 8.8% in the past 7 days. Over the past 24 hours, BTC has seen a 4.2% loss. At the time of writing, BTC currently trades below $26,000. This plummet follows the ongoing negativity in the crypto market including the lawsuit from the US regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which has now affected the world’s largest crypto exchange Binance. ~ Featured image from iStock, Chart from TradingView",NEUTRAL,BTC | USDT,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | USDT,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-dominance-records-shifting-trends-stablecoin-flows/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/13182172.jpeg
42410502,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdXBTG,1686057559,Altcoins Dip Following Second SEC Lawsuit Against Crypto Exchange,"Tokens listed in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit against U.S crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) are tanking.  The SEC sued Coinbase on allegations of violating federal securities law, a day after filling a similar suit against Binance. The exchange’s shares tanked 20% in pre-market trading.  The tokens listed in the lawsuit are Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), Filecoin (FIL), Sandbox (SAND), Axie Infinity (AXS), Chiliz (CHZ), Internet Computer (ICP), Voyager Token (VGX), NEAR protocol (NEAR), NEXO, FLOW and DASH.  Of the thirteen listed assets, VGX took the hardest hit, losing 3.25% in the last hour. Solana’s SOL also fell around 2%, and was also down 9% over the last 24-hours. Solana’s SOL was amongst the named tokens in Binance’s lawsuit on Monday. The Sandbox’s SAND, listed in both the Coinbase and Binance lawsuits, has lost 16% over the last 24 hours.  According to the SEC, Coinbase has operated as an unregistered broker, exchange and clearing agency simultaneously, arguing that it solicited customers, handled orders, allowed for bids and acted as an intermediary all at once. The SEC warned Coinbase earlier this year that it might sue the exchange, sending a Wells Notice, which Coinbase responded to in April.  In a comment to CoinDesk, Cardano Foundation CEO Frederik Gregaard said the organization ""disagrees with the recent qualification of ADA as a security under US law.""  ""We look forward to the continued engagement with regulators and policymakers to achieve legal clarity and certainty on these matters,"" he said. ""Meanwhile, we will keep contributing to the vibrant and diverse Cardano ecosystem.”  Read more: SEC Sues Coinbase on Unregistered Securities Exchange Allegations  UPDATE (June 6, 2023, 17:39 UTC): Adds Cardano CEO comment.",NEGATIVE,ADA | SOL | NEAR,ADA | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | SOL | NEAR,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/06/altcoins-dip-following-second-sec-lawsuit-against-crypto-exchange,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/82f4c6440c9242808167a395355087b22a389650-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410494,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdXAwC,1686056400,EU ‘Crypto Security’ Debate Turns New MiCA Law on Its Head,"A controversial study published last week by the European Parliament appears to turn the rationale for landmark new European Union (EU) crypto laws on its head.  The study, by a panel of academics, denied crypto should get special, lighter rules – arguing that they should be treated by default under a more heavy-handed regime designed for traditional stocks and bonds.  Regulators need to act soon to control the kind of bad behavior that has been revealed of late, its authors say – and they worry the bloc’s much heralded Markets in Crypto Assets regulation, MiCA, has so many loopholes that it will offer few benefits, and could create a regulatory vacuum.  Though commissioned by the European Parliament’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, the study has no formal status within EU policymaking – and, according to some, would require lawmakers to reverse new legislation even before the ink is dry.  The debate over crypto’s legal status is particularly thorny in the U.S. Though Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chief Gary Gensler has declined to say whether major crypto assets such as ether (ETH) constitute securities, a Monday lawsuit from the agency against Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by market capitalization, claimed that a range of tokens for blockchains including Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC) do fall under SEC jurisdiction.  Litigating to decide which side of the line a crypto asset lies on can be painful – as companies such as Ripple, Coinbase and now Binance have found. Treating crypto as a security is more painful still: financial laws often dictate that regulated products can only be traded on particular, registered markets; crypto is supposed to be used to buy things directly, over the blockchain.  Gray  Hence the rationale for a tailored regime. For Francesco Paolo Patti, an associate professor at Bocconi University in Italy, last week’s study is flawed and treats the application of securities law as a black-and-white issue when MiCA expressly creates a spectrum.  EU lawmakers “decided to do something different, to create a special set of rules” for crypto rather than tuck it into existing regulatory boxes, Patti told CoinDesk. “The existence of MiCA makes clear that crypto is special.”  Classifying crypto as traditional financial instruments could obstruct MiCA’s goal of having a single license to trade across the bloc – since different parts of the EU such as Italy and Germany have a different view about what constitutes a security, he said. Plus it wouldn’t even stop the kinds of bad events seen recently in crypto markets, he added, noting that FTX had a license in Cyprus to operate under the EU’s existing financial-market rules, known as MiFID.  Dirk Zetzsche, a professor of financial law at the University of Luxembourg who’s one of the study’s authors, brushes off those arguments, saying that traditional finance rules are needed as a safety net.  Zetzsche worries – based on what he says are private conversations with dozens of regulators – that there could, in practice, be a regulatory free-for-all under MiCA. Even the largest agencies would struggle to enforce rules against the approximately 10,000 crypto assets out there, and smaller jurisdictions simply won’t bother to probe or verify information, he told CoinDesk.  “Gathering the facts is costly for each case,” Zetzsche said in an email, adding that national authorities “will not invest these resources unless they have a good case in their jurisdiction, so it is a de facto waiver by way of non-enforcement.”  Wild West  While the report cites a “Wild West” of decentralized finance – and points to recent collapses such as FTX and Three Arrows Capital – Zetzsche says his aim is to “allow honest, serious innovative participants to excel.”  “It is about crowding out the criminals and ignorant, and leaving the pros in the game,” he said.  Under MiCA, issuers for crypto get a lighter touch – unlike for traditional financial instruments like stocks, they won’t need regulators’ advance permission to publish a white paper for investors. That third way, in between treating crypto as securities or leaving them entirely unregulated, has certainly won plaudits from the industry.  “Dedicated rules are the only way to regulate crypto,” Christian Steiner, head of regulatory affairs at crypto exchange Bitpanda, told CoinDesk, as the dual status of currency and investment means existing rules don’t work. “Crypto has a different technical setup than traditional finance, that also requires many differentiations within the regulatory setup.”  It’s hard to imagine that EU lawmakers will entirely pirouette on legislation that is now, after years of drafting, signed into the statute book. But Zetzsche isn’t alone in raising concerns about how MiCA might play out in practice.  Gerry Cross, director of financial regulation, policy and risk at the Central Bank of Ireland, said in a May 30 speech he was “particularly concerned” about ensuring coordination and consistency in implementing MiCA across the EU’s 27 national jurisdictions. One regulator might veto a crypto model that another accepts, allowing companies to effectively pick and choose their favorite, he argued.  “We think that there is a real risk of sub-optimal outcomes if this is not given the attention that it deserves starting now,” Cross said, calling for the EU’s banking authority to set up a new mechanism to coordinate crypto applications.  Though the text is nailed down, there are indeed still plenty of problems MiCA raises. But, Patti says, it shouldn't be innovative startups hoping to launch a new business idea who pay the price.  “If you ask first [for regulatory approval] and you face an authority, which is not capable of addressing the issue, you have the same problem,” Patti said. “It is therefore better to help the national competent authorities with clear standards, instead of claiming that everything is a security by default.”",NEGATIVE,ADA,ADA | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/06/eu-crypto-security-debate-turns-new-mica-law-on-its-head,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/894c68bdcdeb7e64de84d0d8d93fce14ccf55470-3648x2736.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Rosbank has been conducting a pilot for transactions using cryptocurrencies despite being sanctioned by the United States Treasury Department. Rosbank Makes Its Foray Into Crypto According to a representative from Rosbank, the financial institution is now conducting pilot transactions with private and corporate clients. According to Rosbank, the service is the first of its kind in the sector and is compliant with all Russian legislation and the requirements of the Central Bank of Russia (CBR). While the Central Bank of Russia has steadfastly opposed the free circulation of cryptocurrencies within the country, it is far more welcoming to allowing their use in cross-border transactions. However, the central bank has stated that they must be carried out outside of the Russian financial infrastructure. The move comes after Rosbank’s owner, Vladimir Olegovich Potanin, stated that tokenized assets and a central bank digital currency (CBDC) could play a critical role in driving the country’s digital economy. Russia’s Stance On Crypto Russia’s law on digital financial assets prohibits residents in Russia from accepting digital currencies as payments for goods and services. However, lawmakers in the State Duma are weighing their options and considering specific amendments. These amendments would allow the expansion of the legal framework and include cryptocurrencies, legalizing crypto transactions under an “experimental legal regime.” However, with Russia under severe pressure thanks to unprecedented Western sanctions following the invasion of Ukraine, the government and businesses in the country have been looking at ways to circumvent the sanctions. One of the options includes increasing the use of cryptocurrencies and national currencies. Officials in Moscow have admitted to several companies using crypto to complete cross-border payments despite a lack of regulation. President Vladimir Putin has also suggested that Russia could become a Bitcoin mining hub. The Russian government also curtailed plans to create a state-run cryptocurrency exchange, opting instead for the regulation of private operators. Partnership With B-Crypto Rosbank has entered into a partnership with B-crypto to support the new service. B-crypto specializes in processing cross-border transactions and settlements using digital currencies. Whenever a company initiates a cross-border transaction using cryptocurrency, the payment made in crypto to the foreign counterpart must be reflected in the contract. Furthermore, the invoice issued by the supplier must also indicate a wallet address and the amount of crypto that has been sent. Under the partnership, Rosbank will accept fiat deposits, while B-crypto will be responsible for processing the payment and crypto conversion.

42410489,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdXAmH,1686054655,SEC Sues Coinbase on Unregistered Securities Exchange Allegations,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued U.S crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) on allegations of violating federal securities law, a day after filing a similar suit against Binance.  According to the SEC, Coinbase has operated as an unregistered broker, exchange and clearing agency simultaneously, arguing that it solicited customers, handled orders, allowed for bids and acted as an intermediary all at once. The suit named Coinbase, Inc. and Coinbase Global, Inc. as defendants, but did not name founder and CEO Brian Armstrong or any other executive.  ""The Coinbase Platform merges three functions that are typically separated in traditional securities markets – those of brokers, exchanges, and clearing agencies,"" the SEC suit said. ""Yet, Coinbase has never registered with the SEC as a broker, national securities exchange, or clearing agency, thus evading the disclosure regime that Congress has established for our securities markets.""  In a press release Tuesday, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said these different functions were ""commingled.""  Read more: SEC Sues Crypto Exchange Binance and CEO Changpeng Zhao, Alleging Multiple Securities Violations  ""Coinbase’s alleged failures deprive investors of critical protections, including rulebooks that prevent fraud and manipulation, proper disclosure, safeguards against conflicts of interest, and routine inspection by the SEC,"" he said.  In a statement, Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal, who is also testifying before the House Agriculture Committee on Tuesday, called for crypto-specific legislation to be developed.  “The SEC's reliance on an enforcement-only approach in the absence of clear rules for the digital asset industry is hurting America’s economic competitiveness and companies like Coinbase that have a demonstrated commitment to compliance. The solution is legislation that allows fair rules for the road to be developed transparently and applied equally, not litigation. In the meantime, we’ll continue to operate our business as usual,"" he said.  Coinbase founder and CEO Brian Armstrong tweeted that the complaint ""is exclusively focused on what is or is not a security,"" while also reiterating longstanding industry complaints that the ""SEC has taken a regulation by enforcement approach.""  The SEC pointed to Coinbase's Prime, Wallet and staking products, as well as the actual tokens it lists, as areas where it violated federal securities laws.  The entire crypto market and Coinbase's premarket stock price fell on news of the suit.  Coinbase knew some of the cryptos it made available to U.S. customers may have checked the boxes for securities, the SEC argued, pointing to its Crypto Ratings Council effort, which the exchange spearheaded in 2019 to try and create an informal system to assess whether a cryptocurrency was a security.  ""During this period, Coinbase made available on the Coinbase Platform crypto assets with high 'risk' scores under the CRC framework it had adopted,"" the SEC said. ""In other words, to realize exponential growth of the Coinbase Platform and boost its own trading profits, Coinbase made the strategic business decision to add crypto assets to the Coinbase Platform even where it recognized the crypto assets had the characteristics of securities.""  The suit went on to allege that Coinbase ""identified 'problematic statements'"" by issuers, meaning anything an issuer said that might mean the issued token was a security.  The SEC identified tokens issued by foundations and companies or tied to protocols including Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), Sandbox (SAND), Filecoin (FIL), Axie Infinity (AXS), Chiliz (CHZ), Flow (FLOW), Internet Computer (ICP), Near (NEAR), Voyager (VGX), Dash (DASH) and Nexo (NEXO) as securities in the suit.  Each of these tokens are available on Coinbase's Prime or Wallet services, the SEC said. The suit further detailed these tokens' histories and how the SEC viewed them as securities.  The SEC also pointed to Coinbase's public registration statement, noting that in its risk factors section, it acknowledged that some of the assets it listed may be securities.  The SEC first warned Coinbase it might sue the exchange earlier this year, sending a Wells Notice, which Coinbase responded to in April.  In Tuesday's suit, the SEC alleged Coinbase violated the Exchange Act through its failure to register across four different counts, as well as violated the Securities Act, and is seeking to ""permanently enjoin"" the company from continued violations and force disgorgement and civil penalties.  Unlike its Binance lawsuit, the SEC did not allege that Coinbase commingled customer or allowed company executives to transfer such funds to other entities.

The agreement with the United Arab Emirates seat of learning will support a scholarship in which Bybit is to contribute AED 1 million (US$272,000). The AUS collaboration with Bybit is the first of its kind and a further demonstration to the world that the United Arab Emirates is open for crypto business. The scholarship fund provided by Bybit will support the education of 20 students at the university as they carve out careers in fintech and blockchain. Bybit Digs Deep to Further Crypto Education The agreement enacted between Bybit and the AUS will enable blockchain students to rapidly get up and running; there are plans for the first scholarship grants to be disbursed this fall when the academic year starts. Computer science and computer engineering students who apply and are deemed eligible will have their tuition fees paid by the Bybit Scholarship. In addition to the AED 1 million scholarship fund, Bybit has pledged an additional AED 100,000 to sponsor a hackathon at the American University of Sharjah. This will be open to the local blockchain community, providing a testbed for innovative ideas to flourish and giving developers a chance to demonstrate not only their coding skills, but all their out-the-box thinking. Hackathons have proven a successful means of incubating crypto startups and giving developers a leg up on their blockchain journey. Over the years, numerous successful DeFi projects have been spun out of hackathons, where the best ideas can sometimes receive additional funding to turn a proof of concept into a working prototype. The maiden AUS-Bybit Inter-College Hackathon will take place at the AUS College of Engineering during the 2023-2024 academic year. “Younger generations hold the key in driving the blockchain revolution forward,” said Bybit CEO Ben Zhou. “We are pleased to create the Bybit Scholarship at AUS to help their talented students future-proof their knowledge and skills. We thank AUS for the opportunities to raise crypto awareness and share first-hand knowledge of the industry with students from one of the most prestigious universities in the region. I look forward to being inspired by the future engineers, blockchain scientists, and Web3 startup founders.” Crypto’s Big Hitters Eye the Middle East Bybit’s decision to support the initiative in the UAE arrives at a time when investment is pouring into the Middle East from a number of crypto exchanges intent on establishing a regional presence. While some have been attracted by the massive demand for digital assets across the region, others have been swayed by the hostile regulatory landscape elsewhere, particularly in the US. In April, Bybit opened its new headquarters in Dubai, the Middle Eastern stronghold for an increasing number of crypto companies. The city’s business-friendly credentials, world-class amenities, and excellent travel links have made it a favorite with crypto firms seeking a stable base of operations. The new Bybit HQ occupies an entire floor of One Central in the prestigious Dubai World Trade Center. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Crypto markets held Monday’s losses on Tuesday, the day after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued crypto exchange Binance and its founder Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao on allegations of violating federal securities laws. In the complaint, the SEC also alleged that a number of other tokens are securities. Of these, Decentraland’s MANA has lost the most ground, down 11% over the past 24 hours. Play-to-earn game Axie Infinity’s token AXS lost 10% and Binance’s BNB token fell 7% over the same period. Outflows from Binance across all protocols reached $719 million over the last 24 hours, according to data from Nansen.ai. During U.S. trading hours, net outflows hit $230 million after the SEC announced the suit. Seoul-based crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant pointed out that the withdrawals are well within historical norms.  U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Sean Lane extended a mediation period between crypto lender Genesis and its creditors at a Monday hearing as tensions flared over the role Genesis’ parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), would play in the lender's restructuring. The period, slated to end last month, will now conclude on June 16. Judge Lane appointed a mediator to steer talks between the insolvent lender and its creditors on May 1 after discussions between the parties broke down earlier this year. “There's lots of different kinds of conversations that have to happen in connection with [bankruptcies],” Lane said during the hearing. “The challenge always, of course, is that you can't negotiate everything all at once.” Digital Currency Group is also the parent of CoinDesk.  The SEC’s lawsuit against Binance could be a preview of what may be coming down the road for rival crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN), Berenberg analyst Mark Palmer wrote in a note on Monday. ""We observe that several of the details of the lawsuit that the commission filed against Binance echo those it previously filed against crypto exchanges Bittrex and Kraken, and we believe these cases in aggregate represent a preview of the action that is likely to be filed against COIN,"" Palmer said. In March, Coinbase received a warning from the SEC that it may soon receive enforcement action tied to its listing of potential unregistered securities. ""We estimate that at least 37% of COIN's net revenue would be at risk if the SEC were to target the company's crypto token trading and staking operations,"" noted Palmer, who maintained a hold rating and $55 price target on the stock. Coinbase has 11 buy ratings, 7 holds and 6 sell ratings, according to FactSet data.

13180637,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=536629,1686052385,Dogecoin Plunges 7% As Whales Make Large Moves,"Dogecoin has plunged more than 7% during the past day as data shows that whales have made some large movements. Dogecoin Whales Move Large Amounts On The Chain According to data from the cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert, five large transactions have been spotted on the DOGE blockchain during the last 24 hours. Three of these transfers all saw the movement of the same amount of the meme coin: 600,000,018 DOGE worth $42,946,921 at the time the transactions took place. The other two transactions were smaller and saw the travel of 337,520,424 DOGE ($24,159,104) and 399,999,992 DOGE ($28,631,279), respectively, across the network. As all of these transfers saw the movement of such a large amount of Dogecoin, it’s likely that whale entities were behind them. Whales are humongous holders who carry significant amounts in their wallets, which makes them powerful existences on the network. Surprisingly, all of these transfers were executed at the same time. Such large whale transactions aren’t exactly an everyday occurrence, so five of them happening simultaneously is interesting, to say the least. Based on this and the fact that three of the transactions saw the movement of the exact same number of coins, the natural conclusion would emerge to be that the same entity was behind these transfers. Related Reading: Bitcoin Current Position Is Sensitive, Glassnode Explains Why Indeed, as the blockchain data would confirm, all of these transfers have involved not only the same sending addresses but also the same destinations. This would imply that the investor or group of investors behind these transactions may have made all of these moves with the same goal in mind. Here are some additional details regarding one of these Dogecoin transactions, which may provide hints about the reason behind why the transfers may have been done: Looks like this transfer required a fee of just 2 DOGE to go through | Source: Whale Alert Both the sending and the receiving addresses here seem to be unknown wallets, meaning that they are unattached to any known centralized platform (like an exchange). Generally, such wallets are investors’ personal wallets, which they may use for keeping their coins in for extended periods. Related Reading: Ethereum Top 10 Whales Now Hold 31.8M ETH, A New All-Time High It’s always hard to say what the purpose behind a transaction between two unknown wallets may have been, as it could be anything from a simple change of addresses, to a sale made through over-the-counter (OTC) deals. Usually, investors deposit to exchanges when their aim is selling, so it’s possible that the transactions in the past day may not have been because of the whale planning to sell. However, as mentioned before, them being done for selling through OTC deals is still a possibility. In the last 24 hours, since these transfers have been made, Dogecoin has observed a sharp plunge of 7%. The crash isn’t limited to the meme coin, as in fact most of the market has seen bearish price action during the past day. The impulse of this plunge seems to have been the US SEC suing the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Given these circumstances, it’s possible that the Dogecoin whale in question may have participated in the selloff after all. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading around $0.0667, down 8% in the past week.

Gensler’s plan If there was ever the slightest doubt over SEC Chairman Gensler’s strategy towards the cryptocurrency sector, there can now be none. The SEC, with its main mandate to protect retail investors, has dropped another bomb on crypto and sent the market into a tailspin. Let’s be clear, if Binance has done anything that warrants sanctions and penalties, then there would be a due process for the SEC to make its case. However, it appears that the SEC is tarring the entire crypto industry with the same brush and would bring it to its knees in order to apply the letter of the securities law, or at least the securities law as Gensler sees it. It would appear that Gensler’s ultimate goal is to force all retail investors out of crypto and back to the embrace of the banking system. He would do this by choking off all on/off ramps to the exchanges, and by entangling all the exchanges in costly litigation. The SEC has gone for the jugular by choosing to first attack some of the exchanges working towards full compliance in Coinbase, Kraken, Paxos, and now Binance. Is it the fault of any crypto project that they cannot approach the SEC in order to register, given that even SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce says that this process is almost impossible? Why the SEC is attacking crypto It needs to be absolutely clear that what is happening today with the US government, and its enforcement agencies, is that they are systematically attempting to put the entire crypto industry out of business. Why would this be the case? An industry that is for the people, in that it wants to provide innovation and wealth-making means that will enable everyone to be able to be their own bank and make financial decisions that are outside of the system, is seen as a threat to the system itself. Banks have become monstrous entities that seem to have more power than governments now. They have become obsolete and no longer serve the people. Governments are printing more and more fiat currency which is borne by the people in the form of inflation, and reduced purchasing power. A system such as this can do without a competitor right now. Banks are failing and the Federal Reserve just backs them with currency printed out of thin air. Interest rates are high, unemployment is rising, and prices are going through the roof. Bitcoin and various strands of the cryptocurrency sector are building another system that each individual can be part of. When the monetary system as we know it comes tumbling down, things are going to be bad beyond imagining. However, with Bitcoin and crypto a new and fairer world can exist. An all-important stand It is up to the few to make a stand and resist the likes of Gensler. He talks of everything being a security and has stated that he would like to see a middle man between every crypto project and their customers. He has even resorted to applying enforcement actions against developers of DeFi projects because he can’t get at the project itself. The fight today between the government, the banks, global financial agencies, and the enforcement agencies on the one side, and the crypto industry on the other, will deeply affect the lives of our children tomorrow.

The collaboration between these two industry leaders brings together ThunderCore's rapid growth and expertise in web3 games and SushiSwap's entrepreneurial spirit, this collaboration creates a powerful synergy to drive the future of decentralized finance. With a shared vision and aligned goals, SushiSwap and ThunderCore are poised to revolutionize the DeFi landscape. Together, they have developed a cutting-edge fee-boosting model that enhances Annual Percentage Rates (APRs), allowing liquidity providers (LPs) to maximize their earnings within the ThunderCore ecosystem. This breakthrough mechanism ensures a sustainable circulation of liquidity, benefitting both ThunderCore and SushiSwap ecosystems. Meanwhile, ThunderCore is proud to pioneer the launch of V3 farming in SushiSwap, cementing its position as one of the first chains to implement this groundbreaking feature. Leveraging ThunderCore's low gas fees, the platform is set to attract a diverse range of users eager to participate in liquidity provision. This strategic collaboration between ThunderCore and SushiSwap signifies a paradigm shift in the DeFi landscape, ushering in a new era of collaboration, scalability, and user-centric approaches. This partnership will bring a suite of innovative Sushi products to ThunderCore, including: ● Sushi v3 AMM: Sushi’s framework for spinning up and interacting with pools of different types with varying fee tiers as well. ● SushiXSwap: Sushi's cross-chain swap tool for quick, trustless swaps between supported chains. ● Onsen: Onsen farms are Sushi’s “double reward” farms that are for either new projects seeking liquidity or for established projects that Sushi is working with closely; these pools payout in two assets instead of one. ● Furo: Sushi’s token-streaming platform built upon BentoBox, which allows for token streaming of any compatible asset to any wallet over any timeframe, along with options to create token vestings and cliffs as well. The Partnership aims to a sustainable DeFi ecosystem ThunderCore and SushiSwap share the belief that a novel business model is essential for promoting sustainable growth and driving ongoing innovation in the blockchain and DeFi ecosystem. Consequently, alongside the deployment of the aforementioned products, it can be predicted that both ThunderCore and SushiSwap are actively working on the development of an innovative revenue-sharing mechanism that aims to disrupt the DeFi space. Here's a breakdown of how our forthcoming revenue-sharing mechanism will operate: ● ThunderCore and Sushi will use a percentage of fees generated by activity conducted on ThunderCore via SushiSwap. ● Both parties will allocate and distribute these $TT and $SUSHI as rewards to LPs, thereby boosting APRs for everyone. ● ThunderCore will also buy back $TT and incentivize the community for a sustainable ecosystem. Roger Hsu, CEO of ThunderCore, acknowledges the stifling deadlock in the DeFi market and expresses the intention to create inspiration and break free from this state. The partnership with SushiSwap plays a vital role in achieving this goal, as they work towards establishing a sustainable DeFi ecosystem with improved reward mechanics. “We are excited to launch on the ThunderCore chain and join the ThunderCore ecosystem to help ThunderCore further cement its ranking as a top 5 blockchain in terms of DAUs.” said Head Chef Jared Grey.

13178945,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4609656-ripple-buy-sec-uncertainty-sell-settlement-news-june-update?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1686045585,"Ripple: Buy The SEC Uncertainty, Sell The Settlement News - June Update","Summary XRP's recent price upswing and market capitalization increase may signal investor confidence in an upcoming resolution to the SEC lawsuit. Ripple's On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product adoption remains uncertain, with questions surrounding XRP sales and the company's business model. Predictions for the SEC lawsuit resolution range from as early as July to no later than September, with potential for XRP price to double or triple if the outcome is positive. Despite claims about Ripple's (XRP-USD) use as the one bridge currency for transactions across all financial networks, my first article demonstrates there's not enough documented real-world adoption to justify a long-term position in the coin. But there is an interesting opportunity to buy during the market headwinds from the SEC lawsuit and sell on news of a settlement or outright legal victory. In this update, we'll look at recent price action, industry adoption, ODL progress, Ripple XRP sales, and when the SEC lawsuit could end. Market update and price action XRP has finally enjoyed a recent upswing in price, lifting the coin above the $.50 mark. In the week before this article was written, $2.6 billion has flowed into the XRP market, signaling a strong vote of confidence from the investment community. The market capitalization has risen to $27.19 billion, representing a notable 10% increase compared to the $24.56 billion recorded on May 27. CoinGecko But this is not an independent breakout. As charted below, the price is now simply tracking with Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) as most alt coins do by default. This is much different than the beginning of the year when XRP was mired in a trading range due to overhang from the ongoing SEC lawsuit. BTC and most other coins made substantial gains during that period. What is different now? Why did XRP escape the sideways grind and become free to move with the market again? My opinion is that a significant amount of investors now believe that the lawsuit will end soon. More on that later. CoinGecko Industry adoption The Ripple 2023 New Value Report stated for a time that the Palau stablecoin project (I wrote about here ) was live after a successful pilot with over 200 citizens. This was later edited by Ripple to say, ""Ripple is working with the Republic of Palau on a pilot of a stablecoin— pegged to the US dollar as that is the currency they use—leveraging blockchain technology."" Also removed was the reference to Palau's use of the Ripple's Private Ledger CBDC solution. The net result is that we know nothing new about the status of the project. Bhutan remains the only country publicly committed to the Private Ledger platform. The Central Bank of Montenegro (CBCG) has agreed to collaborate with Ripple to develop a digital currency strategy and pilot. The CBCG Governor Radoje Žugić said that: As a central bank committed to following up-to-date national banking trends, the CBCG is actively ensuring it maintains an efficient financial system. We look forward to collaborating with Ripple on the pilot project for creating CBDC or stablecoin. This is an interesting announcement but it provides no details on whether Ripple will implement their Private Ledger technology or simply act as a consultant. This project is only in the launch phase and has a long way to go. The CBCG must determine the important practical applications, design the system, test with simulations, and conduct a trial in controlled conditions. ODL progress For me, whether to hold XRP long term (beyond the SEC case resolution) hinges upon the documented, real world adoption of Ripple's On-Demand Liquidity product. The Ripple Q1 2023 XRP Markets Report had no additional information on the volume growth of ODL payments but we did learn that Bitso, the leading crypto exchange in Latin America, announced last quarter it surpassed more than $3.3 billion in transactions between the US and Mexico in 2022 through its institutional crypto solutions utilizing Bitso’s strategic partners, such as Ripple and its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product. Some media outlets mischaracterized this news by saying XRP usage was entirely responsible for all $3.3B worth of transactions. In my experience this misrepresentation of the facts is common and is the reason every claim about Ripple's progress in the industry must be closely examined. In the case of Bitso, Ripple is a partner but so are Circle and Tribal Credit : In November, Bitso partnered with Circle to launch an international wire transfer product that allows small businesses and freelancers to change their dollars into stablecoins and then convert them to Mexican pesos. One month later, the exchange partnered with Tribal Credit to launch a cross-border B2B payment option enabling the conversion of Mexican pesos to Stellar USDC for transactions between Mexico and the U.S. I suspect the lion's share of transactions between the US and Mexico are through Circle's USDC ( USDC-USD ). As I wrote in my August Update article , stablecoin usage has exploded for international transfers and remittances. According to McKinsey & Co. , USDC and Tether ( USDT-USD ) completed $3 trillion of transactions during the first half of 2021. The adoption of crypto in emerging markets presents a real opportunity for international money transfers through stablecoins settlement to become a common occurrence. Ripple XRP Sales Despite claims that all Ripple XRP sales now are to ODL customers , questions have emerged about this practice. It would be fantastic if Ripple is no longer dumping coins in the open market but rather supplying customer needs because demand is rising. But is this really the case? Forbes writer John Hyatt recently scrutinized Ripple’s business model, alleging that the company stealthily promotes XRP sales in lieu of actual remittances and cross-border payments using ODL (archive here ). The Malaysian payment company Tranglo is one of Ripple’s most prominent clients using ODL for cross-border transactions (Ripple owns 40% of Tranglo). Recent SEC filings indicate ODL usage at Tranglo is lagging. At the same time Ripple’s XRP sales are accelerating. How can that be? In the Forbes article, Martin Walker, director of banking and finance at the Center for Evidence-Based Management, contends that ODL is the new way for Ripple to sell XRP without it appearing as they are dumping XRP in the open market: With ODL Ripple lends XRP to partners like Tranglo, which then sell the cryptocurrency to exchanges and pay back the loans in cash. The terms governing Tranglo and Ripple’s partnership–as described in SEC filings from InFinT Acquisition Corp., a Cayman Islands-based special purpose acquisition vehicle that has agreed to buy Tranglo’s parent company–suggest that there are no limits to how much XRP Ripple can sell through Tranglo’s ODL facility, irrespective of Tranglo’s need for XRP. We know that CEO Brad Garlinghouse has admitted that Ripple would not be profitable without XRP sales . Ripple made $2.7 billion profit from “ODL-related” XRP sales in 2021 and 2022. Is Ripple selling XRP to bankroll the company through this ODL scheme? In response to a summary of the key data points and accompanying questions that Forbes shared, a spokesperson for Ripple said that some of the numbers taken from SEC filings are inaccurate but refused to say which ones, and that Tranglo represents a small portion of Ripple’s business. Price predictions Technical analyst DonAlt has been trading XRP and points toward a large potential upside: I’ve been re-buying my XRP in here [above the $0.475 level], basically on the way up because I think the XRP narrative could come in rolling again. The SEC case is getting closer and closer. I think basically if you have a stop loss on this thing, the upside is like a double to a triple. And the downside is like… 10 – 15%. And the outcome of the case, or even if it’s like just barely positive news right… it doesn’t even have to be the outcome. If there’s just like a frown on the judge’s face while the SEC is talking, basically you’re gonna see quite a massive pump… that risk-to-reward seems decent. He goes on to say that alt coins by nature are risky, which is true. But it's affirming to see a high profile analyst come to the same conclusion about XRP that I reached a year ago. How far away is SEC lawsuit resolution? John Deaton, a lawyer representing XRP token holders in the Ripple Vs SEC lawsuit recently presented a new timeline : I will be shocked if we did not get decision from the Judge by the end of September. I will absolutely be shocked and I don’t see that happening. Not a decision of this magnitude. This was an update from Deaton's former estimate of May 6 as a rough deadline based on how the judge typically delivers judgements. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse also made some interesting statements in an interview with a technology investment firm CEO: In terms of where things stand today – I’ll try to not get too much into the legal weeds – you are right that I feel very confident that we’ll see a decision from the courts this year. In fact, I think I would guess that it will be in weeks, not months. There were some decisions that happened last week that you may have read about. Another big name in crypto, Charles Hoskinson founder of Cardano ( ADA-USD ), also expressed his opinion during an AMA on May 31. Hoskinson responded “I think it’s probably next month [June]"" when asked if he believed the Ripple lawsuit would end anytime soon. To bookend the first two predictions, Garlinghouse's optimistic estimate could mean as soon as July, with Deaton's deadline of no later than September. We shall see when Judge Torres makes a decision; the whole crypto industry is now waiting for this case to provide some clarity on whether coins are securities. Conclusion There's no new evidence that XRP has value as a long-term holding. The Tranglo SEC filings show ODL adoption is poor. Any metrics around XRP sales for ODL must be carefully examined. As slow as the court proceedings have been, there's sentiment that the case will end relatively soon. I agree that the XRP price could double or triple with any positive outcome but also that XRP remains a risky investment.",NEUTRAL,XRP,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4609656-ripple-buy-sec-uncertainty-sell-settlement-news-june-update?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/13178945.jpeg

Green Signal For Cboe The announcement means that traders on Cboe Global Markets’ digital-asset exchange would be able to enter into margined Ether and Bitcoin contracts. The amended order will allow Cboe Clear Digital to offer clearing services for digital asset futures on a margined basis for futures commission merchants. “The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today approved an amended order of registration for Cboe Clear Digital, LLC (Cboe Clear) to clear additional products, subject to the terms and conditions specified in the order, as a derivatives clearing organization (DCO) under the Commodity Exchange Act.” This will be in addition to the fully collateralized futures and fully collateralized swaps that were previously approved. “The amended order permits Cboe Clear to provide clearing services for digital asset futures on a margined basis for futures commission merchants, in addition to the fully collateralized futures and fully collateralized swaps previously authorized.” Previously, Cboe only offered fully collateralized trading of cryptocurrency futures, which required clients to furnish the entire amount of a particular contract before trading. With margined trading, traders can put up less capital when opening a position. Furthermore, the physical settlement of digital assets will enable traditional financial firms to access Bitcoin and Ether futures without handing over custody to intermediaries. Cboe Digital president John Palmer added, “That’s where the concept of us also having a spot market has advantages. We didn’t want to have to force participants to custody or touch the physical asset.” Prudent Risk-Mitigation Measures Cboe Clear’s parent company, Cboe Digital Exchange, is registered with the Commodities Futures Trading Commission as a designated contract market. This gives Cboe the authority to expand its clearing of futures contracts for crypto assets while ensuring that it does so within the traditional US futures intermediated market structure. Christy Goldsmith Romero, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission president, in a separate statement, added, “The Order is accompanied by prudent risk-mitigation measures implemented by Cboe. I have been vocal about the benefits of bringing appropriate crypto activities into the regulated space in order to protect customers, but in a way that supports oversight, accountability, transparency, and risk management.” Romero added that Cboe’s application was in stark contrast with another from the now-collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX for a “bespoke disintermediated direct-to-customer market structure.” “Too often in recent years, crypto firms have sought to take a business model or market structure that exists in an unregulated environment and port it over to the regulated environment. “Cboe has not done that, instead operating within the parameters of the traditional futures market structure and regulatory framework. It has constructively engaged with the staff and my office to address concerns related to risk and implement risk-mitigating measures.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Changes to ether balances across cohort groups have been largely unchanged, but bitcoin addresses with balances of more than 100,000 BTC seeing a monthly decrease of 31%, the report said.  The spent output profit ratio (SOPR) for bitcoin, which indicates the degree of realized profit, saw a number of spikes during the month, reaching levels not seen since December 2020, “suggesting that considerable profit taking has taken place in the spot markets,” the bank said.  The amount of bitcoin held on exchanges saw a steep decline of 12%, while ether supply saw a slight gain, the wall street giant noted.  Network congestion across both the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains was also a key focus in May, the bank said. This caused monthly address activity for bitcoin and ether to fall by 13.8% and 16.7% respectively, as user activity was deterred by higher transaction fees.  The bitcoin average mean hash rate continued to push past it's all time high in May, gaining 5.4% during the month, with miner revenues increasing by 16.4%, the report added.

Over the past week, there has been a remarkable surge in confidence among large-scale investors who have demonstrated their support for SHIB by acquiring billions more tokens than they have sold. But what has sparked this newfound optimism, and what does it mean for the future of Shiba Inu? Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Poised For Significant Breakout: Here’s What To Watch Out For Large Investors Embrace Shiba Inu Tokens Recent data reveals that large investors have shown immense confidence in SHIB by acquiring an astonishing 338.1 billion more tokens than they sold over the course of the past week. This surge in accumulation by influential participants in the crypto market has led to a remarkable weekly total of 9.34 trillion Shiba Inu tokens being amassed. Expanding on this extraordinary statistic, it becomes clear that the interest of large investors in SHIB is far from waning. Their notable accumulation of SHIB tokens signals a belief in the cryptocurrency’s potential for growth and indicates a positive outlook for its future prospects. SHIB market cap drops below the $5 billion level. Chart: TradingView.com Such a substantial increase in token acquisition suggests that these investors see SHIB as an asset with significant value and are willing to invest substantial resources to secure their position. A Tale Of Consolidation Amidst Investor Interest Despite the recent surge in confidence and substantial accumulation of Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens by large investors, the price of SHIB has yet to exhibit a positive response. According to CoinGecko, the current price of SHIB stands at $0.00000804, representing a decline of 5.8% over the past 24 hours and a seven-day slump of 7.7%. Source: Coingecko SHIB has since been trading within a narrow range, with minimal fluctuations exceeding 6%. Surprisingly, this phase of consolidation has piqued the interest of major investors who have predominantly taken up long positions during the past week. Related Reading: Pepecoin Frenzy Fades: How Meme Token’s Price, Market Cap Were Cut In Half Additionally, the crypto market as a whole has experienced fluctuations during this period of regulatory mess, and SHIB may be impacted by broader market trends. While the price of SHIB has not yet responded positively to the influx of large investors, their sustained interest in the cryptocurrency indicates a belief in its long-term potential. These investors seem to view the current consolidation period as an opportunity to accumulate SHIB tokens at favorable prices, positioning themselves for potential future gains.

An analysis of eToro trades revealed that nearly 80% of the platform's active users were unprofitable over the course of a year, with a 36.3% median loss. Another study found that 97% of futures traders in Brazil lost money over 300 days. Only 5% of Taiwanese day traders were profitable between 1992 and 2006. When the stakes are high, human error becomes costly. This is the case with trading, where trader decisions are often tainted with split-second decisions, panic-based actions, and a sunk cost fallacy mentality. This is likely why the stock market is increasingly run by machines and algorithms. Artificial intelligence has proved capable of tackling this challenge, and one company called Walbi has already designed an AI solution to assist crypto traders. Tapping Into the Power of AI Recent breakthroughs in generative AI have created tremendous hype around artificial intelligence tools. The technology has proven effective in tasks thought to be impossible for an algorithm, like content creation and art generation. Now, AI technology is increasingly prolific in the financial industry. While robo-advisor AUM is expected to reach $2.02 trillion by 2027, startups are leveraging AI to enhance crypto trader performance. AI offers the advantage of processing data much faster than a human. Where a human has to spend hours or days understanding trends and making decisions based on them, an AI can recognize patterns in seconds and offer advice to the trader. It can analyze the market in real-time and catch sudden shifts, fraud, and malicious activity, and even make low-level trading decisions. This allows traders with AI assistance to make quick and confident trading decisions, which in the trading world is incredibly important. Walbi is currently building a crypto trading platform that offers all these benefits, and the project is expected to achieve a significant milestone with the launch of its minimum viable product (MVP) in June 2023. Walbi's AI-Driven Crypto Trading Solution Walbi is a next-gen hybrid decentralized finance (DeFi) platform consisting of a crypto exchange, non-custodial Web3 wallet, and AI tool suite to supercharge trader decision-making. The project has multiple flagship solutions that aim to fulfill Walbi’s mission to make the blockchain industry simpler and more intuitive for everyone. The first one is the Walbi Exchange, a crypto exchange offering up to 500 times more leverage for futures traders without a mandatory KYC. Besides managing liquidity, Walbi's AI tools optimize the order book by predicting demand for digital assets and automatically detecting wash trading, spoofing, and other malicious activity. Besides Walbi Exchange, the project will offer: Walbi Lighthouse: An AI-based trading assistant that does research on behalf of traders and assists them with real-time financial data analysis and personalized trading advice. Lighthouse helps traders make more confident and well-informed decisions while minimizing the risks of human error Walbi Earn: Allows users to stake their crypto assets on Walbi to earn interest without any locking periods and with weekly payouts Walbi Cloud Miner: A cloud mining solution enabling users to mine BTC without purchasing or operating expensive equipment Walbi Wallet: A decentralized, non-custodial Web3 wallet offering users full control over their funds Walbi's Upcoming MVP Launch Walbi is currently in closed alpha but will soon launch its MVP. This release will expand the project's ecosystem with several features and functions, including: WalletConnect integration digital asset deposits and withdrawals margin trading AI-driven trading insights via Walbi Lighthouse the Walbi Waves invite system Besides the features listed above, Walbi's roadmap includes numerous future feature releases. During Q3-Q4 2023, the platform plans to launch WalletConnect integration and margin trading, NFTs, Walbi Lighthouse, and token swaps. Walbi Waves and Cloud Mining, Walbi Exchange, Walbi Earn and portfolio tools, and Walbi Wallet will become accessible to platform users throughout 2024. Crypto Trading, Supercharged Artificial intelligence models are poised to be an unprecedented improvement to trader performance which has long struggled with unprofitable strategies and approaches. Walbi is arriving soon and will be one of the first to leverage the power of AI to make trading faster, easier, and safer. With the assistance of AI tools, the project enables crypto traders to make data-driven decisions, potentially increasing their long-term profitability. Want to learn more about Walbi?

It’s a partnership that demonstrates how vertically integrated crypto exchanges can start to emulate traditional finance, segregating operations using third party custodians, in a bid to avoid the possibility of another FTX collapse.  OKX is the first client to use Komainu Connect, a regulated settlement and custody system for institutional customers that offers 24/7 trading with a mix of cold storage, multiparty computation (MPC) and hardware security modules (HSMs).  “Funds deposited in a Komainu custody wallet are moved to a Komainu collateral wallet and then linked to an OKX account,” OKX chief commercial officer Lennix Lai told CoinDesk via email. “The OKX account then mirrors the balance and allows active trading across OKX's 700-plus spot and derivatives markets.”  The Komainu Connect collateral wallet, which OKX has visibility into, is linked to an institutional-grade tri-party account change agreement, Komainu’s head of strategy, Sebastian Widmann explained.  “There exists a tri-party legal agreement between Komainu as the custodian and OKX as the liquidity venue and provider, and Komainu’s client, as the client of OKX,” Widmann said in an interview. “This allows Komainu’s client to trade directly on exchange with Komainu taking care of the settlement requirements.”  OKX would not go into detail about how much assets under custody would be transferred to Komainu, but Lai said it was “significant” and it's expected to grow as the firms enhance their institutional product offering.  “Our standpoint is the more solutions users have, the better. We are offering on-exchange, off-exchange and third-party balance mirror custody solutions,” Lai said.

The regulator made the allegation in a lawsuit against Binance and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao. Prominent Cryptocurrencies Classified As Securities The lawsuit names an extensive list of cryptocurrencies apart from Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and Solana (SOL). The three rank among the largest and most prominent cryptocurrencies in the market. The other cryptocurrencies mentioned include Cosmos Hub (ATOM), Filecoin (FIL), Decentraland (MANA), Algorand (ALGO), The Sandbox (SAND), Coti ( COTI), and Axie Infinity (AXS). The lawsuit has also identified the BUSD and BNB stablecoins as securities, further compounding the seriousness of the situation. Furthermore, the SEC lawsuit also alleges that Binance has listed crypto assets that have previously been the subject of enforcement action by the SEC. These include several assets, such as TRX, UST, AMP, and REP. This, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission, indicates a reckless disregard for securities regulations by Binance and its executives. However, the lawsuit does not mention Litecoin (LTC) or Ethereum (ETH). Additionally, Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler has clarified that the SEC views Bitcoin as a commodity. However, he has suggested that a vast majority of other tokens in the market are securities. Token Value Tanks Several tokens saw a considerable drop in price following the news of the SEC lawsuit. Among the hardest hit was Solana, which saw a 6% drop, sliding to $20 in just an hour. Algorand, another asset mentioned as a security in the lawsuit, saw its value drop by 9.9% following the news. SEC Chair Gensler has previously spoken quite positively about the asset. Polygon saw a drop of 7%, while Polkadot dropped by 6.9%, according to data from CoinGecko. The Lawsuit Against Binance And Zhao The Securities and Exchange Commission unveiled its lawsuit against Binance on Monday. The commission had sued the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, for alleged violation of several US securities laws. According to the SEC, Binance has been offering its users unregistered securities trading platforms and offering unregistered crypto asset securities sales. “The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Binance Holdings Ltd. (“Binance”), which operates the largest crypto asset trading platform in the world, Binance.com; U.S.-based affiliate, BAM Trading Services Inc. (“BAM Trading”), which, together with Binance, operates the crypto asset trading platform, Binance.US; and their founder, Changpeng Zhao, with a variety of securities law violations.” One of the key charges against Binance involves the company’s US operations. According to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Binance and BAM Trading, the Binance.US operator, operated as exchanges in the United States of America without registering with the SEC, in addition to being clearing agencies and broker-dealers. According to the SEC, certain cryptocurrencies were offered as securities on Binance’s primary international exchange and Binance.US. “Binance and BAM Trading have unlawfully engaged in unregistered offers and sales of crypto asset securities,” the lawsuit states. “In so doing, they have deprived investors of material information, including the risks and trends that affect the enterprise and an investment in these securities.” The Securities and Exchange Commission also alleged that Binance secretly controlled its US operations, allowing high-value US customers to evade restrictions and divert billions of dollars worth of customer funds. Binance has refuted all allegations made by the SEC. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Interest around staking has increased since the Ethereum blockchain completed its transition to a proof-of-stake system in September.

Data from Nansen.ai shows that outflows from Binance across all protocols hit $719 million over a 24-hour period.  During the U.S. trading hours, net outflows hit $230 million after the SEC announced its lawsuit against Binance.  Despite the seemingly staggering net outflow, that shows no signs of slowing down, Nansen data also shows that Binance’s stablecoin balance remains healthy. The exchange currently has a stablecoin balance of just over $8 billion, with a seven-day outflow of $519 million, or roughly 6% of holdings. OKX, the exchange with the next largest holdings, has a balance of $4 billion.  In a Twitter thread, Seoul-based crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant pointed out that the withdrawals are well within historical norms.  SAND, MANA Lead Declines  In the complaint, the SEC also alleged that a number of other tokens, including Binance’s BNB token, Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), Coti (COTI) and Algorand blockchains (ALGO), Filecoin network (FIL), Cosmos hub (ATOM), Sandbox platform (SAND), Axie infinity (AXS) and Decentraland (MANA) are securities.  Most of these tokens continued well into the red during the Asia trading day.  Metaverse majors SAND and MANA led the declines, with SAND down 13% to $0.52 and MANA down 11.6% to $0.45. Meanwhile, Binance’s BNB is down 8% to $276.48.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) is flat, down 0.08%.  During the Asia trading day, $26 million in positions were liquidated, according to CoinGlass, with $16.8 million being long positions.

This scheme encompassed more than $700 million in unregulated transactions carried out over a period of 10 months in 2018. The 63-year-old Vikings co-owner was convicted on charges of bank fraud and money laundering. The United States Attorney’s Office in New York released a statement on June 5, revealing that Fowler was sentenced to a total of 75 months. Related Reading: Pepecoin Frenzy Fades: How Meme Token’s Price, Market Cap Were Cut In Half US Attorney Damian Williams explained that Fowler’s sentence was a result of his engagement in processing hundreds of millions of dollars in unregulated transactions for cryptocurrency exchanges, acting as an illicit banking entity that evaded federal regulations.

Shadow banking refers to non-bank entities engaging in bank-like operations, often of an illicit nature. The particular shadow banking entity involved in this case was Crypto Capital Corp, which was established with the purpose of facilitating transactions for cryptocurrency startups that operated outside of the traditional banking system either by choice or necessity. BTCUSD makes a sudden drop to the $25K level today. Chart: TradingView.com Initially, Fowler entered a plea of not guilty to all charges in 2020. However, in April 2022, he changed his plea to guilty. In his recent statement, Williams highlighted that a series of falsehoods allowed Fowler to deceive and mislead several banks. The Deceptive Web Of Global Trading Solutions & Crypto Capital According to Williams, Fowler successfully executed his criminal activities by establishing Global Trading Solutions (GTS) in February 2018. GTS collaborated with Crypto Capital and various other cryptocurrency firms based in Israel. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Poised For Significant Breakout: Here’s What To Watch Out For Within this arrangement, Fowler, GTS, and the crypto firms employed deceitful tactics to bypass licensing requirements. They deceived banks by providing false information, allowing them to open accounts used for processing cryptocurrency transactions. Williams said: “At no point were Fowler, GTS, nor any of the crypto companies ever licensed as a money transmitting business in the United States, as required by federal law.” Fowler took advantage of this setup by opening multiple undisclosed accounts, effectively facilitating the crypto transactions without the banks’ knowledge. Additionally, he failed to disclose GTS’s affiliation with the crypto firms, further obscuring the true nature of the operations. In addition to the prison sentence imposed on Fowler, he has been ordered to forfeit a staggering $740 million. -Featured image from XFL Newsroom",NEGATIVE,SHIB,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/vikings-co-owner-gets-jail-time/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/13176364.jpeg

The fervent frenzy that once surrounded this meme-inspired digital asset has faded, leaving investors questioning the future of Pepecoin. Pepecoin initially captured the attention of crypto enthusiasts and meme lovers alike, leveraging the popularity of the iconic Pepe the Frog character. Riding the wave of meme-driven mania, the token experienced an exhilarating surge in value, captivating headlines and attracting a considerable influx of investors seeking quick profits. However, this euphoric ascent was short-lived, and Pepecoin’s once unstoppable rise abruptly came to a halt. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Poised For Significant Breakout: Here’s What To Watch Out For PEPE Suffers Sharp Decline In Value In a sudden turn of events, Pepecoin (PEPE) has experienced a significant downturn, as evidenced by its price on CoinGecko plummeting to an astonishingly low value of $0.00000102. The token has suffered a substantial 14.4% slump within the past 24 hours, and its decline over the course of the last seven days has been even more alarming, reaching a staggering 28.4%. Source: Coingecko At its peak, Pepecoin boasted a market capitalization exceeding a billion dollars. However, the recent downturn has seen the token’s market cap dwindle to below $500 million as of press time. This equates to a drastic erosion of over 50% of its value on the price charts. Crypto total market cap weakens to $1.05 trillion on the daily chart at TradingView.com Meme Coin Struggles To Recover: Possible Explanations Pepecoin’s failure to reach a corrective bounce raises questions about the underlying factors contributing to its downfall. While numerous elements could be at play, one possible explanation lies in the shifting market sentiment towards meme tokens. These tokens, which often gain popularity through viral memes and social media trends, have faced increased scrutiny and skepticism as investors become more discerning about their investment choices. As Pepecoin continues to grapple with its current predicament, market participants are left wondering whether the token can regain its lost value or if its decline will be a turning point for meme tokens as a whole. Related Reading: Bedrock Upgrade: How Optimism Game-Changer Could Impact OP Price SEC Lawsuit Vs. Binance Adds To Pepecoin’s Woes The already beleaguered Pepecoin faces further challenges as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sues Binance, sending shockwaves through the cryptocurrency markets. The fallout from the lawsuit has caused a sea of red, with Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies experiencing bearish pressure. Consequently, Pepecoin finds itself caught in the crossfire, as the weakening Bitcoin exerts additional downward pressure on the meme token. This bearish move has amplified the selling pressure on Pepecoin, pushing it to retest its bullish order book (OB) at press time. The bearish sentiment surrounding Bitcoin has cast a shadow on the broader crypto market, including meme tokens like Pepecoin, and raised concerns about the token’s ability to sustain its value. As Bitcoin’s weakness persists, Pepecoin remains vulnerable to further selling pressure. Analysts predict that a drop to $0.0000008579 or even lower is feasible if the bearish momentum continues. -Featured image from PictureCorrect",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | ICO | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/pepecoin-frenzy-fades-how-meme-tokens-price-market-cap-were-cut-in-half/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

Bitcoin was recently trading at about $25,750, down nearly 5% over the past 24 hours. Much of its initial downturn occurring in the two hours after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed suit against Binance, accusing the exchange giant of violating securities laws. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization treaded comfortably above $27,000 for much of the past week, but the allegations against Binance rekindled fears about industry integrity and the intent of regulators to exert more control over exchanges. Binance – and other exchanges – have been facing regulatory scrutiny for years.  “The Binance news obviously led to a big sell-off, but the news itself wasn’t exactly surprising,” Bob Ras, co-founder of Sologenic, a blockchain-powered network for tokenizing securities, told CoinDesk. “Rumors had been swirling for some time about forthcoming action against Binance.”  But Ras added that he wasn’t convinced “that we are going to experience massive liquidations,” similar to those following the 2022 implosions of Luna, Celsius and FTX. “Back then, we saw a great many forced sellers. I don’t think there are nearly as many forced sellers now as there were back then. I suspect that we’ll likely be in for a gradual recovery here.”  Ether also tumbles  Ether, the second largest crypto in market value, was recently changing hands below $1,800, off more than 5% from Sunday, same time. ETH and other major altcoins followed a similar path as bitcoin did on Monday with the bulk of their declines coming in the immediate hours after the SEC suit. BNB, Binance’s exchange token, and SOL, the native cryptocurrency of the Solana blockchain, recently plunged more than 10%. ADA and MATIC, the tokens of smart contract platforms Cardano and Polygon respectively, and popular meme coin DOGE were recently off more than 8%. Even litecoin, which has been rallying the past few weeks, fell more than 9%. The SEC suit called those tokens unregistered securities.  The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets performance, was down more than 6%. All six sectors that compose the Index, including DeFi, computing and culture and entertainment stumbled into negative territory. The crypto Fear & Greed Index remained in neutral, where it has largely stood for much of the year.  Industry stocks tumble  In a note to CoinDesk, Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull, called the SEC suit “unsurprising,” but also wrote that the exclusion of ether from the filing was “a good sign.” He added: “Unless any major developments impact Binance’s functioning, we don’t think the market is likely to lose a lot more.”  While wider equity indexes, including the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500, largely shrugged off the Binance hubbub, ticking down a few fractions of a percentage point, industry-focused stocks slumped. Coinbase stock fell more than 5% right after the filing was released and was off more than 9% at market close. Shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR), which holds a vast amount of bitcoin on its balance sheet, fell more than 8.5%, Bitcoin miners Riot Blockchain (RIOT), Marathon Digital (MARA) fell more than 8%, while Bitfarms (BITF) dropped more than 7.4%. Safe haven asset gold traded flat just below $1,980.  SEC lawsuit fallout  Lawsuit fallout seemed to seep into all corners of the crypto universe. By Monday afternoon (ET), Binance had suffered more than a half-billion in net outflows, according to a Dune Analytics chart by crypto investment product provider 21Shares. Traders withdrew more than $1 billion of digital assets during this period, compared to the $546 million in deposits, per the chart. According to crypto data platform CoinGecko, the +2% depth for BTC on Binance is $2.7 million, which Charles Storry, head of growth at Phuture, a crypto index platform, told CoinDesk was ""very low liquidity levels.""  In a Telegram note to CoinDesk, Strahinja Savic, head of data and analytics at Toronto-based crypto platform FRNT Financial, noted Binance had “continued to operate relatively normally since it was charged by the CFTC” earlier this year. “US users have also long been barred from accessing Binance,” he wrote. “It’s hard to pin down an element of this story that really changes the status quo.”  He added: “It’s important to keep in mind that Binance’s regulatory issues do not implicate bitcoin. It’s hard to imagine any traders looking at the SEC’s allegations and thinking that anything there is damaging for the bitcoin bull thesis. However, given the extent of cross collateralization in the space, paired with exaggerated correlations, it’s not surprising to see bitcoin selling off.”  Sologenic’s Ras believes that if the U.S. central bank pauses hiking interest rates this month or later in the summer, “we would likely see a return of seriously positive momentum.”  But he noted pessimistically that with investors in this market “feeling jittery, it will take time to restore confidence. The SEC’s actions are pushing many crypto projects out of the United States, and from this perspective, this is clearly becoming a net negative for the U.S. economy and innovation more generally.”  Biggest Gainers  There are no gainers in CoinDesk 20 today.  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Terra LUNA −16.3% Smart Contract Platform Gala GALA −10.2% Entertainment Decentraland MANA −9.0% Entertainment  Insights  Lido’s stETH token is now the seventh largest token by market cap, right ahead of Cardano and just behind XRP, according to data from CoinGecko.  stETH has edged out ADA because the market has grown comfortable with staking, and the market has been seeking out a staking solution that’s not going to be affected by U.S. regulatory uncertainty.  So far, the only unstaking parades have been from the shutdown of Kraken’s staking service – and a significant amount of that staked ether went right back into the system via stETH – and Celsius, which moved out of staking contracts on stETH and back into staking contracts with another provider.  All of this should be an endorsement of stETH, as there’s significant institutional trust in the staking mechanism behind it. As CoinDesk previously reported, surging demand for ether staking has led to a month-long wait for nearly 50,000 validators, particularly following the Shapella upgrade, which stimulated a deposit surge and an influx of new market participants, locking over 19 million ETH for staking. At the same time, analysts who have spoken with CoinDesk have continued to downplay fears of any sort of price crash post the Shanghai upgrade – and continue to be proven right – highlighting the balance between new stakers and withdrawals, the inherent withdrawal limits and the mitigating effect of liquid staking derivatives.  So staking is a healthy market, and seems permanent. Lido dominates it by a long shot, controlling 28% of the market with $13.4 billion in total value locked, according to DeFi Llama data. And it's a competitive market too; there are 60 staking protocols with over $1 million in TVL. Lido’s closet competitor has $2.2 billion in TVL.  The only thing that could sink this ship is if a larger percentage of staked ether becomes profitable. Right now it’s just 31%, but we’re only one bank failure and DeFi summer away from that hitting 50%. Will there be a rush for withdrawals then?
