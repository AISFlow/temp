42425144,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHsrhh,1385221812,"Korean Startup Coinplug Raises $400k, Half in Bitcoin, Half in Fiat","Korean startup Coinplug has closed an investment round paid partly in bitcoin.  Coinplug raised $400,000 from Cupertino-based fund SilverBlue, with half the amount raised in bitcoin and the rest in fiat currency. The startup plans to launch a digital currency exchange, wallet and merchant platform in Korea in mid-December.  ""It's SilverBlue's first investment,"" said SilverBlue managing director Richard Yun. ""In Korea, people take to new technologies really quickly, so I think [bitcoin usage] is going to boom in Korea, like China.""  According to Yun, who has a board seat at Coinplug and will serve as interim finance director, the investment will be used to develop a trading and merchant platform on the web and across multiple mobile operating systems.  Coinplug is expected to launch on 17th December and has 15 engineers on its team, which is spread across Korea and Silicon Valley. Yun claims Coinplug will provide ""financial institution-level security"" to its users.  Korea is a relatively undeveloped bitcoin market so, if it makes its launch date, Coinplug will be the country's first end-to-end platform, similar to Coinbase, providing everything from an exchange to wallet and merchant services. According to Yun, interest in bitcoin in Korea is growing, but pent-up demand isn't easily satisfied by existing international exchanges like Coinbase. The legal status of bitcoin exchanges in Korea is ambiguous at the moment. He added:  ""Bitcoin is prime news in Korea now, but we need to educate people about it. They really want to buy.""  Coinplug won't be the first Korean bitcoin exchange. A fixed-price exchange has been operating since 2012 by a company called Bitcoin Korea and another exchange called Korbit was launched this year. Yun is confident that Coinplug will beat the incumbents.  ""People can compare [our competitors'] size to our size when we launch. We have good technologists and we have the funds,"" he said.  CoinPlug and Silverblue's founders have a long history. Coinplug's founder and CEO is Ryan JoonSun Uhr, who founded mobile location-based services firm Celizion in Korea in 2002. He was also chief technology officer at Exio Communications, a San Jose wireless technology firm that was acquired by Cisco Systems for $165m, according to Yun, in 2000. Exio's founder, Ki Hyun Joo, is SilverBlue's chief executive. Both men, and Yun, worked at Cisco Systems for several years.  Asian bitcoin exchanges have been in the news recently. The BTC China exchange, for example, became the world's largest exchange by trading volume last month, surpassing Japan's Mt. Gox. The Chinese exchange also raised $5m in funding this month. GoCoin, a payment processor headquartered in Singapore, also announced a seed round of $550,000 this month. Owen Van Natta, a former Facebook chief operating officer, was a noted participant in the round.  Investors are rushing to fund bitcoin exchanges. Venture firms pumped an unprecedented $9m in funding into Boston-based Circle at the end of last month. The investors included Jim Breyer, Accel Partners and General Catalyst Partners. Circle's founder is Jeremy Allaire, who previously helped create the web development language ColdFusion.  Other exchanges that have raised significant sums include Coinbase, with $6.88m to date and BitPay, which has raised $2.51m.

42425130,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHsrJh,1385165129,"194,993 BTC transaction worth $147 Million sparks mystery and speculation","UPDATE 25th November, 12:16 GMT: We contacted Bitstamp CEO Nejc Kodrič to ask whether there was any truth in the rumour that the transaction was made by his company, but he declined to comment.      Bitcoin internet hangouts were buzzing today after noticing someone had shifted 194,993 BTC (over $147m on CoinDesk's BPI) in one transaction.  The transaction, tagged ""Shit Load of Money!"" by its mystery originator*, appeared on Blockchain.info early in the evening of 22nd November. It is one of the largest transactions in bitcoin's history, by far the largest under bitcoin's recent high prices, and represents 1.6% of all bitcoins now in circulation. (*Correction: as pointed out in the comments below, the tag was attached to the receiving address and not by the originator.)  Bitcoin's distributed nature ensures all transactions are visible on the public record, though users are identified only by 30+ character addresses (and any tags they choose to add). If the address is not already known and the user does not identify themselves in an obvious way, they remain anonymous without analysis or detective work.  Unsurprisingly, a transaction of that size has prompted the bitcoin community to do some analysis and detective work. The transaction involved a large number of sending addresses, with some of them from blocks mined in February 2010 or even earlier, prompting excited speculation they might be from Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin's absent (and likely pseudonymous) founder.  Or was it Richard Branson, who caused his own digital currency frenzy today by announcing his company Virgin Galactic would accept payment in bitcoin?  Satoshi Nakamoto is unlikely to reveal him/herself in such an ostentatious manner, and early coins may have changed hands several times. More possibly the lucky owner is a miner from bitcoin's early days, or a business moving the amount to a more secure form of physical storage. The Washington Post's detective work, done by a researcher into how much block chain information may reveal about users, speculated the transaction might be exchange Bitstamp moving its own funds between addresses.  While 194,993 BTC was moved, it's important to note it has not been exchanged for any fiat currency... that we know of. 'Dumping' such a large amount at once would probably have a negative impact on bitcoin's value.  On the bitcointalk forums, some users were less interested in the owners' identity and more impressed by the infrastructure that allowed such an amount to be transferred without any regulatory hindrance, lawyers, or fees (the user paid no transaction fee at all). Even handing over that amount in hard cash would be a logistical challenge.  ""Beautiful, so effortless to move so much money... I'm sometimes involved with very large cross-border transactions and the logistics of making payments of this size are, more often that not, a complete PITA, with timezones and banking hours getting in the way,"" wrote user runam0k.
