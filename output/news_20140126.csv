42425337,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwAzh,1390774793,KryptoKit Partners With BitPay for Two-Click Shopping,"KryptoKit  , the secure bitcoin wallet and encrypted message plugin for Chrome browsers, has partnered with BitPay to integrate a 'two-click' solution to pay bitcoin merchants.  The Canadian company unveiled its new feature at the first North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami on 24-26th January. It includes KryptoDirectory, a one-stop shopping directory incorporating BitPay data on business accepting bitcoin payments.  BitPay allowed access to its database of merchants as part of the deal.  The directory will appear as a tab within the KryptoKit Chrome wallet window. Once users surf to the site they'd like to shop at, the extension automatically sniffs out bitcoin addresses for each item from the site and inserts them into the wallet window, creating a list of payment options.  Users simply click on the address corresponding to the item they want to purchase, and then click 'send' (hence the term 'two-click solution').  Auto-fill  One of KryptoKit's key features is its ability to detect bitcoin addresses on any site and display them for easy selection. There's no need to scan QR codes or even copy-paste address strings.  ""As Bitcoin becomes more universally known and accepted as currency, we saw a clear need to have a single, clean and easy to use resource for finding businesses that welcome cryptocurrency,"" said Anthony Di Iorio, the company's co-founder along with Steve Dakh.  ""KryptoKit will roll out more BitPay merchant sites in the upcoming weeks.""  KryptoKit is free, open-source and has a five-star rating on Google's Chrome Web Store. It also features an encrypted message service where users can create new PGP keys or import existing ones.  Users do not need to register, set up accounts, or enter any personal information to use it. And your data will not be stored 'in the cloud' - all private keys and bitcoin addresses are kept locally on a users' machine.  Co-founder Di Iorio also happens to be Executive Director of the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada, and founder of the Toronto Bitcoin Meetup group and bitcoin startup co-working space Bitcoin Decentral.

42425341,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwB9h,1390761620,Book a Jamaican Luxury Villa for 3.5m Dogecoin,"If you've been hard at work mining altcoins, one way to get a well-deserved break while still contributing to the cryptocurrency economy is by kicking back at a luxury waterfront villa in Jamaica.  Island Villas Jamaica  , a holiday villa rental firm, is now accepting litecoin, dogecoin and bitcoin for bookings. Island Villas' owner, Yvonne Blakey said:  ""We get people from all over the world staying with us. The villas are pretty high-end, and they all come with a full staff, including a cook, housekeeper and butler.""  Blakey's son, Jon Blakey, came up with the idea to start taking cryptocurrency payments for villa bookings. He is a dogecoin enthusiast (""I'm fully invested in doge right now""), and is mining the dog-inspired currency. He also has a day job working on servers for GoDaddy.  Bookings  This week, Blakey updated the Island Villas website with a notice saying that the digital currencies are now accepted there. He then submitted the website's URL to Reddit. Incredibly, he received a serious inquiry into booking the 'Avalon' villa, which costs $7,000 a week, to be paid for in dogecoin. He said:  ""I literally had the idea yesterday morning. I edited the website, put it up on Reddit. And then I got contacted [about a booking] last night.""  Blakey stated that he had calculated it would cost 3.8m dogecoin to rent the Avalon villa. If the inquirer goes ahead with the booking, then Blakey will accept the dogecoin, convert it to bitcoin and then convert it once more to fiat currency for Island Villa. He plans to give altcoin customers an invoice with a 30-minute payment window to account for the altcoins' high price volatility.  Blakey said that accepting digital currencies at Island Villas was a reflection of his interest in the emerging digital currency economy, but it also served a practical purpose. Taking bitcoin payments is cheaper than current payment transfer methods like PayPal, he said.  ""I figured it was a no-brainer to throw it out there,"" he added.  Luxury villas  Island Villas manages and rents 30 private properties to tourists visiting Port Antonio in the northeast of Jamaica. The villas range from one-bedroom properties to four-bedders situated on an eight-acre compound. Prices range from $3,000 a week to $10,000 a week. Most of the villas' visitors are couples and families from the US, Germany and Switzerland, Yvonne Blakey said.  Some of Island Villas' properties are near the Blue Lagoon, a 170-foot deep body of water fed by a freshwater spring and open to the sea. It was a major hangout of the jetset in the 1950s, attracting the likes of Errol Flynn and Elizabeth Taylor. In more recent years, Harrison Ford, Cameron Diaz and Rhianna have enjoyed its deep blue waters.  What does Yvonne Blakey, who has been running Island Villas since 2000, make of getting paid in dogecoin?  ""I've been ignorant about [digital currencies], but just yesterday we had guests from the United States, an older couple couple. I just asked them, do you know about bitcoin? He said, yes, of course. I was amazed. I've been asking a few other people and I'm amazed that this is around.""  Jamaica's love of dogecoin has been in the news recently. The Jamaican bobsleigh team received $30,000 worth of the dog-inspired cryptocurrency in donations this week to further its attempt to qualify for the Winter Olympics. The team was immortalised in a fictionalised account of their debut at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary in the Disney film Cool Runnings.

42425333,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwAnh,1390750418,"Head of Russia's Largest Bank Backs Bitcoin, Again","Sberbank may not be a household name in the west, but it just happens to be the third-largest bank in Europe.  It's also the biggest bank in Russia and Eastern Europe, with nearly half a trillion dollars in assets and a workforce of 300,000.  The bank is owned by the Central Bank of Russia and it is headed by German Gref, who served as the Russian Minister of Economic and Trade from 2000 to 2007. Gref’s tenure was marked by a period of economic reform and liberalization. Judging by his recent statements, he is still open minded when it comes to monetary issues.  Protecting bitcoin?  This news follows comments Gref made about the currency back in December. Speaking in an interview at the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Gref voiced his support for digital currencies.  “It’s a very interesting global experiment that breaks the paradigm of currency issuance.”  He added that he had already made his opinion heard in government circles, by sending letters to the central bank, the finance ministry and to the very top, the Kremlin. In the letters, Gref asked officials to intervene with parliament in order to avert any bans against digital currencies, reports Bloomberg.  He said an outright ban would be a “colossal mistake"", adding: “It definitely shouldn’t be banned, it must be studied and maybe regulated properly"".  Colleagues aren’t convinced  Although Gref sees an opportunity in digital currencies, many fellow bankers would beg to differ. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told reporters at Davos that the rise of bitcoin will prompt governments to clamp down and treat it like any other payment system.  VTB Group  is Russia’s second-largest lender and its CEO Anrei Kostin doesn’t share Gref’s enthusiasm, either. He described digital currencies as “quite dangerous” for the money market and stated that VTB Group doesn't plan on getting involved.  “Our monetary authorities are only now formulating their opinion about this,” he said.  Russia's ultimate plan  Last week, a set of amendments introduced in the Russian parliament caused a fair amount of FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) in the bitcoin community, as it was misinterpreted as potential bitcoin ban. Russian regulators are of course keeping a close eye on digital currencies, as are their counterparts across the world. However, they have not taken any noteworthy action against the proliferation of digital currencies in Russia.  President of the Russian Electronic Money Association Viktor Dostov told Bloomberg that it is still unclear how Russia would regulate digital currencies. He stated that the only point of control would be an exchange centre where bitcoins would be traded for money. However, we are not sure whether Dostov is advocating the creation of a centralised exchange on a national level, or simply referring to independent bitcoin exchanges. It is a case of lost in translation.  In any case, Gref’s statements should go a long way toward reassuring bitcoin investors and enthusiasts in Russia and CIS member states for that matter.  It is also interesting to note that in a recent interview with CNN, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev admitted the country’s economy is slowing down, but pointed out that his government is gradually transforming Russia into a knowledge-based economy and introducing 21st century technology into various industries.  Whether or not Russia is ready to embrace 21st century payment systems and alternative currencies remains to be seen.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/01/26/head-of-russias-largest-bank-backs-bitcoin-again,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0b434ae263e99290551aa150412483b4eafe6888-1000x719.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425334,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwArh,1390739353,Companies and Charities Unite to Promote Bitcoin in Africa,"How can for-profit companies and charities work together to promote bitcoin awareness in the developing world?  A handful of different projects launched in Africa recently could point the way forward. There are plenty of worthy causes around the world already accepting bitcoin donations, in both developed and developing economies.  What sets the following projects apart from those, however, is an equally worthy ulterior motive: to actually get bitcoin technology into the hands of recipients and those around them, and to demonstrate its utility in daily life. Each charity is doing it their own unique way.  PR problems  Both the international media and government-backed regulators are always quick to paint bitcoin as a vehicle for money-laundering and drug trafficking, producing a biased first impression to those unfamiliar with its true function.  And in Africa, the number of people unfamiliar with bitcoin is high. It's up to these projects to make sure the local public's first encounter with bitcoin is a positive and hopeful one.  ICE3X  ICE3X  is not a charity, but South Africa's predominant bitcoin exchange platform. Trading in bitcoin, litecoin and local currency (Rand) it is KYC compliant, and users are required to be South African residents with identification and a registered local bank account.  But the exchange also seeks to build community acceptance through a philanthropy program, identifying local worthy causes and introducing them to bitcoin while also raising funds.  Its first cause is fighting animal cruelty with ""animal warrior"" Suzette Kotze, head of the local Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) in the small town of Stilfontein.  Despite its size, Stilfontein deals with over 21 cases of extreme animal abuse per month, and the shelter Kotze operates is fast running out of funds, requiring 30,000 Rand (roughly 3.15 BTC at press time) to continue.  Knowing little about bitcoin or cryptocurrencies, Kotze approached ICE3X after hearing about its appeal for community projects and was fascinated by a system that allowed small donations from anywhere in the world at close to zero cost.  Easy transfers  It would be difficult to hold an international campaign for such a project through traditional payment channels or established charitable organisations. Even PayPal, which often waives fees for charitable causes, does not operate equally in every country.  Bitcoin can, of course, be used to crowdfund non-charitable projects without fees as well.  ICE3X is monitoring the success of its community philanthropy program and is currently vetting five other causes for future support. It does not collect fees or commissions from the organisations.  Company representative Tristan Winters says a good first impression for bitcoin is essential, especially since its greatest disadvantage in African is not misinformation, but sheer obscurity.  “It’s not that bitcoin has a bad image in Africa. It has no image at all. In that way it is a clean slate: a real opportunity. The potential of bitcoin in Africa is often cited. But the issues to be overcome are real and often overlooked. The first step is clearly good PR.""  He added: ""It’s only by supporting local organisations and fostering good causes, while maintaining a ‘teach a man to fish’ attitude, that bitcoin will reach its full potential in Africa.""  Bitcoin tablets  On a different part of the continent, and with a different bitcoin mission, is Richard Boase (a fellow CoinDesk contributor). He is heading a team of collaborators on a trip to Kenya in conjunction with charity BitcoinTablet project and Kenyan bitcoin remittance processor BitPesa.  This effort is probably more overt in its intention to get bitcoin into as many hands as possible, while also demonstrating its usefulness to local entrepreneurs. The team will distribute technology on a limited basis alongside an education campaign.  PayPal does not function at all in Kenya and banks usually charge high fees to transfer money into the country.  The ultimate aim of Slovakia-based BitcoinTablet is to get charity organisations and other locals using bitcoin for themselves, by supplying them with Android tablets with wallet software and the skills to use them.  Boase will spend six weeks with charities in four different locations across Kenya to investigate whether the technology is indeed viable or helpful and, if so, how it could overcome unique local challenges.  Investigating  The initial trip to Kenya is mostly a fact-finding one. BitcoinTablet understands that simply traveling to a developing country and handing out technology is a naive idea that might create new problems of its own (eg theft or the disposal of outdated electronics).  In partnership with Tomer Kantor of iamsatoshi.com Boase has started a bitcoin meetup group in Nairobi. Tunapanda, an organisation specializing in bringing technology to remote communities, will help with classes based on materials from the Bitcoin Education Project and the Khan Academy.  Factors like infrastructure and internet availability will play a part, as will the acceptance of bitcoin's sometimes complex new concepts, ability to secure wallets, and the usefulness of existing electronic payment systems like M-Pesa.  BitPesa has pledged to help by offering free exchange on all bitcoins donated, alongside its continuing support and sponsorship of the Nairobi meetup.  Dr. Michael Meegan of ICROSS International has been working in Kenya's Rift Valley for over three decades, said bitcoin and associated network technology ""could be a game changer"" for organisations like his. He said:  ""I think this could be a very easily measurable program that could be shown to impact on health professionals at Government District level.""  He added: ""There are a plethora of demonstrable indices that this resource could provide at District level to impact the latest health resources which could be shared to the various health services.""  Kantor will make a follow-up visit to Kenya in March to assess the programs and document any progress.

42425348,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwBJh,1390728706,"Miami Bitcoin Conference Day 1: Crime, Krugman, and BitLicenses","The temperate winter climate of Miami, Florida is serving as a pleasing backdrop for the numerous attendees of the North American Bitcoin Conference.  The symposium, being held at the Miami Beach Convention Center this weekend, brought a huge crowd. Many of the talks were held with all seats full.  In the afternoon, the second hall, used in the morning for merchant vendor workshops, was used as an additional seating area with the speakers being broadcasted on a large video screen.  Here are some highlights from Day One of the conference.  Cash Used More Than BTC for Crime  They say that crime doesn't pay. It probably doesn't in the long-term. But criminals still use monetary instruments in order to break laws.  And despite the media exposure bitcoin has received regarding scams, thefts and the sale of illicit goods, most crooks still use cash.  David Aylor is a South Carolina attorney who is involved with what is likely the first case where the federal government has seized bitcoin.  His presentation 'Bitcoin, Dirtier than Real Money?' made the argument that there's plenty of good to be had with cryptocurrencies, and that it is going to attract bad actors just like any other technology would.  Craigslist was an example that Aylor used as a tool that can be used for good as well as bad. Bitcoin can be used the same way and the media's portrayal of BTC is one of the reasons that some people ""think bitcoin is evil"", he said.  Aylor advocated for candor and transparency within the bitcoin economy in order to propel it forward. A lack of honesty is a problem that could thwart bitcoin's success.  ""We don't want to become a rouge industry based on secrecy,"" he said.  Eric Benz, VP of Business Development for ZipZap, made the case that there is a business use for bitcoin, and that it is inevitable that the negative news as it relates to bitcoin will result in compliance policies coming from governments.  ""We need smart regulation that does not stifle innovation,"" he said. ZipZap should know. The company allows people to complete online transactions with cash in thousands of physical locations around the globe.  Bitcoin Opportunities  Bitcoin conferences are usually an exciting time for enthusiasts to get together and talk about potential. Day One's venture capital panel did just that.  Roger Ver  the CEO of MemoryDealers.com and an angel investor, Marc van der Chijs a partner at CrossPacific Capital, Matthew Roszak the co-founder of SilkRoad Equity and Rik Willard who is founder of MintCombine all offered opinions about VC interests.  Investor Rik Willard made it clear that virtual currencies will bring ""a lot of things you can't even think of yet"".  Roger Ver echoed that sentiment, saying that bitcoin's opportunities scale globally. ""Bitcoin doesn't care where you come from,"" he said.  Ver made clear that BTC could become a legitimate worldwide method of exchanging value. ""Bitcoin has the potential to be a universal currency.""  Economist Jeffery Tucker, the founder of Liberty.me, took to task traditional economists who do not have favorable views of bitcoin, specifically a certain author of New York Times op-eds.  ""Does it really matter what Paul Krugman thinks?"" he asked the audience.  Tony Gallippi, the CEO of BitPay, pointed specifically to Miami as a place where a prosperous hub for bitcoin-related activity could happen. ""Miami is an amazing city for international business,"" he said during his presentation.  Gallippi pointed out that TigerDirect, an online retailer that recently started accepting bitcoins, is based in Miami.  BitLicenses and the Future  How burgeoning businesses should be operating in the face of possible regulatory sanctions dominated the startup panel that featured leaders from several different BTC-related businesses.  Wendell Davis the founder of Hive Wallet, Steve Beauregard the founder and CEO of GoCoin, Dan Held the product manager of ZeroBlock, Oleh Zadoretskyy the founder and lead developer of BTC Robot and Paul Vernon the CEO of Cryptsy were the panelists.  Interestingly enough, only Cryptsy was incorporated in the United States. The other companies on the panel cited different countries for incorporation because of somewhat murky US policies in regards to cryptocurrencies.  Paul Vernon, Cryptsy's CEO, welcomed the idea of BitLicenses, a regulatory framework that the state of New York is considering.  ""I think the BitLicense is a great idea. I hope that every state does that,"" he said.  Roger Ver on the Bitcoin Price and Mining  Day One of the conference was capped off by angel investor and bitcoin advocate Roger Ver and he did not disappoint. When asked about the future value of bitcoin, Ver was understandably bullish about price.  ""It's very, very clear that it is going to be higher than it is today,"" he said.  Perhaps the most intriguing though that Ver conveyed was his opinion on mining. ""It's a market that has huge potential,"" he said. Ver pegged bitcoin mining as a $1 billion industry given the roughly one million coins that will be rewarded over the next year.  ""I don't think anyone understands how big this industry will be,"" he said.
