42377671,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72yqN,1412631209,Russia Seizes Bitcoin Mining Equipment in Incident at China Border,"Russian authorities confiscated four bitcoin mining machines from an unidentified citizen last week at a security checkpoint located on its southern border with China.  A report from the Siberian Customs Department suggests that the individual attempted to bring ""four undeclared metal objects"", later identified as ROCKMINER R4 units, through a customs checkpoint at the Manzhouli Sino-Russian Inter-Trade Tourist Area.  However, the bitcoin miner failed to provide the necessary documentation or pay required fees for doing so.  The customs officers evoked a 2012 decision issued by the Board of Eurasian Economic Commission to validate the confiscation. The decision, amended in 2013 and 2014, governs the import and export of encryption facilities to and from Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, all of which are members of one customs agreement.  Despite the increasingly stern stance Russia has taken toward its domestic bitcoin industry in recent weeks, the incident appears to be unrelated to the country's proposed ban of ""monetary surrogates"". Further, it does not suggest a more immediate crackdown on bitcoin's domestic mining industry and community.  The draft bill, first announced in August, garnered even more headlines internationally last week as Russian lawmakers revealed the full text of the proposed law. If passed, the law would apply to virtually all of the country's industry, from individual bitcoin miners to bitcoin businesses and even news sites.  In addition to the loss of the mining units, the unidentified miner also faces potential fines, as the Siberian Customs Department indicated it has initiated administrative proceedings in the developing case.  Russian community reacts  Due to initial confusion surrounding the news, there was speculation on Russian bitcoin blogs that the incident was perhaps part of a more immediate crackdown by the local government on bitcoin activities.  Russian-language bitcoin news blog Coinside.ru, for example, wrote in its report that the news could be seen as ""the start of the practical part of the Russian campaign against bitcoin"".  However, Artem Tolkachev, managing partner at the law firm Tolkachev & Partners disagreed with this interpretation, noting that the initial news release suggests mining equipment is simply subject to the same special customs regulations as all types of encrypted materials.  ""The document makes no special reference to the mining equipment, but it divides the encryption facilities into different groups and establishes the order of import and export,"" Tolkachev told CoinDesk.  Mining imports still possible  In absence of the formal approval of the draft bill banning bitcoin activities, Tolkachev asserted that, in his opinion, the import and export of bitcoin mining equipment is still legal in Russia provided the owner seeks a one-time license from the Ministry of Industry and Trade.  Still, the procedures required could prove to be a deterrent to local mining operators, especially in light of potential forthcoming regulation.  Tolkachev said:  ""To get [a one-time license], one needs to present an application for a license, a copy of the equipment purchase contract, a copy of the certificate of registration with the tax authorities, license to conduct the activity (if needed), authorisation of the Federal Security Service (FSB), the description of all encryption facilities that the imported equipment contains.""  Further, he said this procedure must be completed in 90 days, but that in some cases, only approval from the FSB is needed.  Tolkachev provides legal consultation to a number of regional startups, though he says most are now turning focus away from the Russian market in light of recent events.

42377681,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72z1h,1412622028,Dark Markets Grow Bigger and Bolder in Year Since Silk Road Bust,"In this concluding article of our series looking at Silk Road, a year after its closure, we examine the impact the Silk Road bust had on the dark markets and their most widely used digital currency, bitcoin.  The FBI may have taken down the Silk Road in spectacular fashion, slapping a seizure notice on the dark marketplace's website and executing the high-profile public arrests of Ross Ulbricht, and later, bitcoin executive Charlie Shrem and digital currency trader Robert Faiella.  According to academics and researchers studying dark web markets – which transact almost exclusively in bitcoin – listings for illicit goods and services have actually grown in the aftermath of the Silk Road bust. The rising popularity of such markets among drug vendors and customers means that illicit trade is set to expand even more, one researcher believes.  Bitcoin's creation and subsequent explosive popularity has been a crucial factor in the growth of global dark markets, according to James Martin, a senior lecturer and researcher at the Macquarie University Centre for Policing, Intelligence and Counter-Terrorism, who has written a new book about the subject.  Martin said:  ""Bitcoin was absolutely critical to the development of Silk Road and cryptomarkets more generally. This was acknowledged by [Silk Road mastermind] Dread Pirate Roberts; he said it was one of the pillars of Silk Road.""  Bitcoin economy and dark markets  In the six months following Silk Road's shakedown by the FBI, new dark markets proliferated and listings for illicit goods surged, researchers at the Digital Citizens Alliance (DCA) have found.  The non-profit group, which works on promoting Internet safety to ordinary web users, found that the number of drugs listings on the biggest dark markets had almost doubled by March to 32,029, compared to six months earlier when Silk Road was taken offline.  The DCA report looked at listings on 11 currently live dark markets, of which six were newly launched platforms. It compared the latest listings to the 18,174 for drugs on the four major dark markets that existed last October.  Among the current markets it examined are Silk Road 2.0, Agora and Evolution, plus new entrants White Rabbit Anonymous Marketplace, Outlaw Market and The Pirate Market. The dark markets operating last year also included now-defunct dark markets Silk Road, Black Market Reloaded, Sheep Marketplace and DeepBay.  Silk Road and the bitcoin economy  Given that the most widely used digital currency of dark markets is bitcoin, just how much of the cryptocurrency is sloshing around in these illicit bazaars?  The proportion of the bitcoin economy undergirded by dark market trade is best estimated in a 2012 paper by Nicolas Christin, a computer engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University who does work at its information security lab.  Christin collected data from Silk Road over eight months between the end of 2011 and 2012. Over this period, he found that 1.35 million BTC were exchanged on the dark market. Comparing that to the 29.6 million BTC traded on other exchanges over the same period, he found that Silk Road transactions corresponded to 4.5% of all traded BTC.  When Christin took other factors into account, like the possibility of Silk Road users buying bitcoin to fund their dark market purchases and then trading bitcoin back to fiat currency, the number of potential transactions attributed to Silk Road activity could double from a conservative estimate of 4.5% to as much as 9% of all bitcoin trading activity, as measured by traded value on exchanges at the time.  But 2011 and 2012 were very different times for bitcoin. The bitcoin price hit a high of $9 during Christin's observation period; it's trading between $350 and $400 today.  Christin also found that at the time, 24,000 items were being sold on Silk Road over a six-month period. Contrast that to the 13,000 in drug listings alone on Silk Road that the DCA recorded in just one October day, before the bust.  That's why Christin is updating his study. He said he's collected a fresh set of data from dark markets that he's in the process of analysing. He won't say what markets he's looked at, and won't be drawn on any preliminary analysis of his new data. He said it will be several months before the research is ready for publication.  Christin said he's not surprised by the growth of new dark markets in the wake of Silk Road's demise, alluding to the amount of publicity generated by the busts and the arrests of Ulbricht and Shrem, but he noteed that the growth in listings recorded by the DCA may not mean dark web trading activity has increased.  ""I want to emphasise that it is unclear that the number of listings is a good proxy for economic activity. One might list a large number of items and yet not carry out that many sales,"" he said.  Dark market comforts drive growth  The growth of dark markets poses the question: If law enforcement agencies have already shown they can break the screen of anonymity afforded by the Tor network and bitcoin transactions, why are new dark markets popping up with more listings than ever before?  Martin, of Macquarie's policing and intelligence research institute, thinks it's because drug dealers are finding it's far safer to do business this way – even with the threat of an FBI raid hanging over them.  He said:  ""Law enforcement is only part of the risk for people who sell drugs. The bigger risk and more frightening risk is not someone kicking down the door to arrest you, but someone kicking down the door to kill you and steal your stash.""  For drug dealers, Martin says, dark markets present a new opportunity to strip away the ""systemic violence"" associated with the distribution and secure storage of narcotics. A dark market vendor doesn't have to deal with the organised crime groups that traditionally take care of drug distribution and security in return for protection money, he said.  It's not just the vendors who are enjoying the benefits of illicit e-commerce. Drug buyers can now browse a vast catalogue of narcotics on their phablets, with comprehensive reviews from fellow customers to provide an indication of quality.  Consumers are also safer because they don't have to interact with potentially violent gang enforcers, either. Instead, the postman drops off their latest dark market order at their doorstep.  Martin cautions that the amount of trade taking place on dark markets is tiny compared to the global trade in illicit narcotics. Global Financial Integrity, a non-profit focused on tracking illicit financial flows, estimates that drug trafficking amounted to trade flows of $320bn in 2011. The dark web trade is a tiny slice of that, Martin says, although researchers haven't been able to quantify it. By comparison, the FBI alleges that Silk Road made annual revenues of $1.2bn.  However, dark web drug sales are attractive to both vendors and customers, so they are set to grow, Martin said:  ""As long as the technology holds strong, they are very good reasons for this trade to get bigger and bigger.""  Deep or dark webs?  While the terms 'deep web' and 'dark web' are often banded about interchangeably, they don't mean the same thing.  The deep web refers to any portion of the web that isn't indexed by a search engine. Content that lives on the deep web includes relatively innocuous – and sometimes stultifying – material, like the database containing North Dakota's court records, which is maintained by the government of the rural US state.  Google and other search engines don't crawl through the contents of these databases, so they're invisible to someone traversing the web on its most well-travelled highways.  The deep web, then, is the part of the web that's hidden from the 'surface web', which is what search engines can find. That's the definition of the term according to Bright Planet, a consultancy focused on the deep web founded by the man credited with coining the term, Mike Bergman.  So much for the deep web. What about the dark web? As you may have guessed, this is where things can get illicit. The dark web is that section of the web that is both intentionally hidden and cannot be accessed by a standard web browser, according to Bright Planet.  Dark web sites usually have addresses that aren't governed by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the international body that regulates domain names. Websites ending in .com or .org, for example, are governed by ICANN.  Domains that exist beyond the ICANN system are known as alternative DNS roots or ADRs. These include websites that end in .geek, .micro or .bit, as is the case with Namecoin domain names.  Websites on the Tor network, which include Silk Road and other marketplaces for illicit goods mentioned in this article, are examples of dark web sites. These sites end with the .onion suffix.  Accessing websites with ADR domains usually requires a specific piece of software. For sites on the Tor network, the Tor Browser, a piece of software designed specifically for surfing that network, must be installed to access them.  The mainstreaming of dark markets?  There are signs that dark markets are evolving beyond the drugs-infatuated niche of Silk Road and its genre.  The creators of OpenBazaar, for example, want to bring their decentralised market to a wider swathe of Internet users who aren't interested in buying drugs, but do want to preserve their autonomy and privacy.  OpenBazaar is a peer-to-peer marketplace that lets vendors hawk their wares anonymously and without relying on a central platform. Vendors host their product listings on their own computers. Trade is conducted in bitcoin.  Sam Patterson, who leads operations for the open-source project, says OpenBazaar is nothing like Silk Road or its successors.  ""Silk Road was a centralised marketplace – directly controlled by an individual or small group – that catered almost exclusively to a subset of the population who wanted to trade in illicit substances.""  By contrast, Patterson, said, the platform he's building is decentralised – no one owns the network – and it's simply a platform for individuals to conduct business without an intermediary skimming off commissions and fees.  ""It is a platform for people to manage their own trade online, directly with others,"" he said.  The coming e-commerce boom... in drugs  Even as the dark web develops at a rapid clip – there is a now a trade publication reporting on market goings-on and a search engine to make dark market shopping easier – law enforcement agencies seem to be left trailing in the wake of decentralised, encrypted platforms.  Martin, the drugs trade researcher, said he has spoken to law enforcement agencies and they are struggling to police dark markets, despite US agencies' spectacular takedown of Silk Road.  ""With online drug trading, you have hidden financial transactions; the dealer and customer never meet in the same place; you have drugs arriving in the post [...] all of this breaks the 'business model' of conventional law enforcement,"" he said.  Anti-narcotics agencies need to come to grips with dark markets quickly because they are only set to grow, Martin added. Just as e-commerce was pooh-poohed by brick and mortar retailers 20 years before giving rise to retailing giants like Amazon and Alibaba today, law enforcement is now only dimly aware of the development of dark markets.  ""We're in a position now like the big department stores of the 90s, for example, who saw online retailing as a flash in the pan, thinking it would never take off. They thought people would want to come to a store to buy sunglasses or shoes. Clearly we know that isn't the case now. There are compelling reasons to speculate that the online drugs trade is going to expand further in years to come.""

42377674,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72ywf,1412610390,Investor Tim Draper Leads SnapCard's $1.5 Million Seed Round,"SnapCard has announced a $1.5m seed round led by noted bitcoin investor Tim Draper.  Launched in November 2013, snapCard has long offered a browser plugin that enabled consumers to purchase items from major e-commerce platforms that don't currently accept bitcoin. However, the investment marks its emergence from four-to-five months of relative quiet and under-the-radar development.  The funding round coincides with snapCard's launch of its own digital currency payment processor that will allow merchants the ability to accept bitcoin, popular altcoins such as litecoin and dogecoin, and XRP, the native digital currency that powers the distributed payment protocol offered by Ripple Labs.  Speaking to CoinDesk, CEO Michael Dunworth voiced his belief that snapCard can compete in an established field of merchant processors by focusing on developing markets, particularly Latin America.  Dunworth told CoinDesk:  ""We're focused on payment processing, establishing infrastructure you can use globally and being really coin-agnostic. We know that digital currencies are here to stay, so we want to make sure that we can scale as communities grow to adopt different currencies along the way.""  Brock Pierce-led investment group Crypto Currency Partners, Fortress Investment Group-backed Insikt Ventures, Great Oaks Venture Capital, noted bitcoin-friendly startup incubator Boost VC, as well as a number of undisclosed angel investors, also contributed to the investment round.  In conjunction with the launch, snapCard also unveiled a point-of-sale (POS) app for its brick-and-mortar merchant clients, available for Android devices from the Google Play Store.  Selling a big vision  While Dunworth framed snapCard as an aspiring global service, initially the company will open to merchant customers in bitcoin's most developed markets, Australia, Canada and the US.  Still, Dunworth said this will change soon, should the company be able to execute its market strategy:  ""We want to have it all up and running to 30–40 countries before the holiday season starts to kick in.""  Boost VC's Adam Draper told CoinDesk that this big-picture vision was one of the core reasons he has invested in the platform, which also earlier graduated from Boost VC's startup incubator.  Calling snapCard a ""force to be reckoned with in the payments space"", Draper added:  ""We met Michael Dunworth and (COO) Ioannis Giannaros and loved their ambition. People love their products, and they sold us a big vision.""  Enrollment for merchants  SnapCard will accept bitcoin on behalf of consumers and provide local fiat via direct deposit, or send the digital currency directly to a third-party wallet of the merchant's choice. Like competitors BitPay and GoCoin, the company does not offer its own digital wallet.  To ease merchant concerns regarding security, snapCard indicates it will leverage a bug bounty program offered by CrowdCurity, the IT security startup that raised $1m in seed funding this July from a group of investors including Tim Draper.  SnapCard will further conduct identity verification through BlockScore, a California-based startup that garnered $2m in seed funding from Battery Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Boost VC.  To begin with, merchants must provide an email address, as well as details of the type of service they provide, how they plan to use snapCard, and whether it will be used at all or some of the businesses locations or at only events and promotions.  Merchants are then verified by snapCard after providing their full legal name, home address, phone number, date of birth and the last four digits of their social security number.  First-mover advantage  The funding news provides the latest evidence that, despite the number of established providers in the bitcoin merchant processing space, major VCs believe there's room for more alternatives.  SnapCard will now need to compete for new clients against BitPay, Coinbase and GoCoin, all three of which recently gained the ability to onboard merchants through PayPal's Payments Hub platform.  Dunworth acknowledged the challenge of competing against these companies in more developed markets, but suggested that snapCard's international focus will be its key advantage.  ""We're trying to act really quickly,"" he said, ""lining up essential partnerships that can allow for strong distribution to get a footprint going.""  Ultimately, he even took an optimistic view on this aspect of the space, suggesting it will help all of the ecosystem's processors continue to innovate.  ""I think the competition is healthy because it gives consumers a choice,"" he concluded.

42377675,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72yxv,1412606331,Portuguese Manufacturer Bitcoin Já Launches New Bitcoin ATM,"Portuguese manufacturer Bitcoin Já launched its first Bitcoin ATM in Lisbon over the weekend  The company is a brand new name in the world of bitcoin ATMs, so this is not only its first bitcoin machine in Portugal, but also the world.  The launch of the 'BJATM1’ model took place at the ATM's permanent location, Lisbon's @Cinema theatre, on Saturday, 4th October.  PayPal support  Bitcoin Já  describes its ATM as a versatile, feature rich and highly scalable system. Being a two-way machine, it currently allows users to buy or sell bitcoins for fiat currency.  However, the company said it is already working on software updates that will enable support for altcoins and PayPal payments, as well as certain types of service payments.  FinTech DNA  CoinDesk discussed the launch with Bitcoin Já founder Joaquim Lambiza, who was keen to note that the machine had been extensively tested by his team and some members of Lisbon’s bitcoin community.  Lambiza has previously worked as a partner at IBM and PriceWaterhouseCoopers, where he was responsible for several global IT projects.  “I left IBM to dedicate myself to my two passions – aviation and finding the disruptive technology that will change our lives. I found that in the block chain technology,” Lambiza told CoinDesk.  Lambiza said he decided to launch an ATM in Portugal last January, but was not satisfied with the approach or returns offered by existing solutions. His solution? To create his own from scratch.  Lambiza explains:  “A very reputable Portuguese OEM kiosk manufacturer, Partteam, had an OEM ATM kiosk design, so it was just natural that we ordered the product. I joined together highly experienced hardware and software experts, coupled with business know-how, and created the Bitcoin Já ATM model BJATM1.”  He added that Bitcoin Já plans to sell ATMs rather than operate them, with the exception of the Lisbon installation which doubles as the company’s showrooms. Therefore the company will not charge a fee to operators for basic functionality.  The project was funded solely by Bitcoin Já.  Appealing to operators  Lambiza said his system is very scalable, and thus allows variety of features to potential operators – whether they decide to operate just one machine or a cluster of them.  Operators can also either choose a hot wallet or one of a number of supported exchange services. The Lisbon unit will use a hot wallet, with a 3% fee to be levied from customers.  What sets the ATM apart from the rest of the competition, he indicated, is the guiding design concept employed by the team, emphasising community development and operator profitability. It allows for a lot of scalability, customisation and more revenue for potential operators.  “In my opinion, keeping the operator profitable will help grow the network and indirectly promote and grow the crypto-currency industry,” Lamboza explained.  The upcoming addition of PayPal and service payments, Lamboza argues, will increase both flexibility and revenue for the operator, rendering the units more attractive compared with other firms' products  Bank ATM warning  Shortly after the ATM went live, the Bank of Portugal appeared to address the launch directly, issuing a warning on the use of bitcoin and bitcoin ATMs, as reported in the Algarve Daily News.  The statement pointed out that bitcoin ATMs are not integrated with the country's ATM system and that digital currencies are unsafe and unregulated.  As with the many previous cautionary statements issued by European regulators, it names volatility, lack of regulation and consumer protection mechanisms, AML issues and potential criminal activities as the bank's main concerns.  However, the warning says nothing about the legality of operating and using bitcoin ATMs, which remain legal in Portugal  The publication also reported that Algarve is expected to get its first bitcoin ATM soon.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/10/06/portuguese-manufacturer-bitcoin-ja-launches-new-bitcoin-atm,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/213455d430b2528f8a222ae6765c0fc6496048c7-1480x987.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377673,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72yst,1412600496,New Concierge Bitcoin Buying Service Targets High Net-Worth Investors,"Binary Financial has officially launched BTC-01, a bitcoin liquidity service that aims to target high net-worth investors who it believes are being turned away from the bitcoin market due to a lack of high-touch alternatives.  BTC-01 will open Binary Financial's established bitcoin trading services to the family offices, investment institutions and wealthy individuals who want to gain exposure to bitcoin and the broader asset class that is springing up around the technology.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Binary Financial managing partner Harry Yeh said that BTC-01 is the product of months of research as well as the trial and error that comes from operating an existing trading service in a rapidly evolving market. The digital asset investment specialist conducts proprietary cryptocurrency trading, hosts its own bitcoin mining operations and recently made an investment in mining manufacturer BitFury.  Yeh cited the trading flurry surrounding China's tightening of financial controls around its domestic bitcoin industry last December as the inspiration for its new trading product. He said that Binary Financial was beseiged by calls from big investors at the time, but that due to the limitations on the technology underpinning its operations, it was unable to fully capitalize on the market.  He told CoinDesk:  ""We've turned away probably $15m worth of business, or that was the potential business we could have had if we actually had a product like BTC.01.""  BTC-01 marks an evolution in Binary's service, as the platform will use the enterprise security solutions offered by multisig bitcoin wallet specialist BitGo to better serve its clientele, whether they want to have total control of their funds, or allow Binary to operate as the custodian.  ""BitGo is the only wallet that can support these types of use cases [...] and allow Binary to manage their trades in the way a wealth manager would manage their stock portfolio,"" CEO Will O'Brien told CoinDesk.  BTC-01 will initially serve clients in North American and China, though Yeh said Binary is evaluating other markets.  Tapping new technology  Many of Binary's clients seek to put 5%–10% of their wealth into bitcoin with the same convenience they would when investing in traditional asset classes.  The solutions offered by BitGo, Yeh said, allow Binary to remove pain points for customers while allowing them better access to bitcoin markets.  ""We've always had a service where we can manage the wallet for our clients, but it's always been a pain. When they wanted to sell, we needed to wait for the coins to be able to sell them. Now, with a multisig solution they can call me up and say, 'Hey Harry, I want to move this block, go ahead.' We'll have access to their wallet and that's it. It's less friction.""  With BitGo's multisig service, Binary will create three keys for each account, extending one to the investor, while another is shared by Binary and the client. In turn, the third key is kept for disaster recovery. With the move, Binary joins BitFury and the Bitcoin Foundation as the latest digital currency company to enable BitGo's platform.  O'Brien went on to cite the additional advantages his company's technology can provide in terms of convenience and security, saying:  ""[BTC-01] clients don't have to go about trying to figure out how to set up a wallet, they don't have to worry about bitcoin being held with pooled funds somewhere like a Mt Gox. [BTC-01] is about security and liquidity access combined.""  Wealth manager demand  Binary further framed BTC-01 as a necessary market offering for the many North American and Chinese wealth management firms that are seeking to serve high net-worth clients.  Yeh told CoinDesk that Binary's research over the last year revealed that 25%–50% of wealth managers and investment banks in North America have clients asking about bitcoin, and 25% of these clients are ready to buy.  However, Yeh added, before BTC-01 wealth mangers and investment banks had been unable to capitalize on client interest due to the comparatively thin order books on major bitcoin exchanges, the relatively limited offerings at mass market bitcoin brokerages and regulatory uncertainty.  Though these companies could sign up for accounts at major exchanges, Yeh asserts that what they're really looking for is a trusted partner that can navigate the complexities of what is, for their operations, a relatively niche offering.  ""A lot of the wealth managers we deal with, their biggest frustration point is they just want to service their clients. They just want somebody who can be trusted they can send somebody to,"" Yeh said.  Liquidity as a service  Even if wealth managers and investment banks seek to use services provided by exchanges, there are advantages to over-the-counter trading.  Yeh, for example, has long talked about the slippage that occurs on major bitcoin exchanges, whereby those who execute large bitcoin buy orders actually cause the price of bitcoin to rise, thereby increasing the cost of their investment as demand rises and individual bitcoins in the buy order increase in price.  Yeh notes that this market behavior can also occur on the selling side, and that one of the main value-adds for BTC-01 is the liquidity it will offer traders.  ""Part of what the service provides,"" Yeh explained, ""is we have people that are almost always ready to take the other side of a trade, all across the world.""  A buyer's market  Yeh also explained that Binary is launching BTC-01, in part, because the firm believes wealth managers are looking for this solution today, because bitcoin is trading at a low.  ""We do have a larger number of wealth managers looking to diversify their portfolios, but they've been waiting for the price to go down, so this is one of those better buying opportunities,"" Yeh said.  Yeh went on to voice his belief that services like BTC-01, which help onboard new, high net-worth investors to the bitcoin market, will also have a positive effect on the wider bitcoin market, saying:  ""Even though we take most of our blocks over the counter, once we run out of over the counter, we have to go on exchanges to buy.  He added: ""We think longer-term this is positive for the price of bitcoin.""

42377660,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72yf3,1412597882,"Bitcoin Price Finds Hard Floor Following 26,000 BTC Sell Order","After buyers snapped up $7.8m worth of bitcoins that were selling for $300 each on exchange Bitstamp on Monday, bitcoin’s price appears to have found a hard floor in what has been a largely unpredictable trading period recently.  On Sunday, bitcoin’s price dropped through the 18-month average purchase price of $337.60, signalling uncertainty to many traders in the market. Then, in the early hours of the Asian morning on Monday, a sell order of 26,000 BTC at $300 that was placed on exchange Bitstamp brought a temporary halt to the volatile price and narrowed bid-ask spreads between the four exchanges in CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  By the time of the European morning however, buyers had snapped up the entire order and the BPI jumped up into the low-to-mid-$320s.  “When the sell order for 26,000 BTC came onto Bitstamp, the price dropped from $317 to $300 in two seconds. I’ve just bought back in now that block has been lifted,” said Adam O’Brien, CEO of BTC Solutions, a Canada-based provider of ATM exchanges and leveraged trading services for bitcoin.  Investor tactics  O’Brien said that Monday’s unprecedented BTC offer on Bitstamp was most likely a single investor looking to artificially move the price lower and buy back bitcoin later at a reduced price, probably in the low $200 range.  Instead, buyers swarmed the offer. For market participants, the recent volatility has presented a welcome opportunity to make big sums of money trading bitcoin in large volumes, mostly through the practice of arbitrage trading or by taking fees for providing trading enhancements such as BTC Solutions’ leveraged product offering.  With this offering, and for a cost of 0.3% per day, buyers and sellers can obtain immediate execution on trades for as much as eight times their nominal investment. In the one-week period, as prices have fluctuated from a high of $384 to a low of $290.83 on the BPI while exchange volumes have cooled off, traders have positioned themselves in over-the-counter (OTC) markets among various regional counterparties with different supply and demand preferences. This enables them to capture the impacts of the see-sawing drop in bitcoin’s market capitalisation.  “The increase in OTC volumes particularly on Sunday gels with a lot of the activity we are seeing over here too,” said Ron Hose, CEO of Coins.ph, an exchange and wallet service in the Philippines, which has just opened a sister service in Thailand.    Bitcoin for remittance  Hose explained that, for the many Asians who work overseas and send money back home, bitcoin is increasing in popularity since individuals have until now had to fork out large sums for services such as Western Union to transfer money between borders. Bitcoin makes these costs obsolete, Hose explained.  Due to the lack of available financial services providers open over the weekend periods in their home markets, OTC services can be appealing to these investors, said Hose. As the price has continued to decline, exchange-traded volumes have dropped as many buyers and sellers have instead chosen to enter into OTC transactions with buyers or on a peer-to-peer basis.  In the previous seven-day period, volumes averaged around 30,000 BTC per day, according to data supplied by Bitcoinity, which relies on exchanges to report their own numbers. That amounts to just half the amount of volume they have received on their best days over the past month and indicates a return to the volumes of trading seen over the summer period.

42377685,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72yvP,1412594449,Bitex.la Exchange Acquires User-Friendly Bitcoin Buying Service,"Argentina-based exchange Bitex.la is acquiring and relaunching a bitcoin-buying service aimed at novice bitcoin users in Latin America.  The move sees the firm closing its offshoot company, bitcoin marketplace Conectabitcoin.com, as a separate entity and spinning that product into its real-time bitcoin exchange.  Bitex.la  was launched in May as the first regional bitcoin exchange connecting all Latin American countries. Its initial product was directed at seasoned traders; providing the ability to place orders where trading had previously not been easily accessible.  Conectabitcoin's chief marketing officer Manu Beaudroit told CoinDesk the service provided is similar to Coinbase's offering in terms of use. However, the mechanics differ, as customers do not need to connect their bank accounts to send funds.  Nubis Bruno, Conectabitcoin founder and Bitex.la chief product officer, explained: “The new Conectabitcoin will be a two-step process where you can just state how much you want to spend in local currency, pay through Astropay, and have bitcoin credited to your Bitex.la account.""  He added:  ""Conectabitcoin is a nice smallish product that makes Bitex way friendlier for newcomers, a straight line from fiat to bitcoin in Latin America using Astropay-supported payment methods.”  The rebranded Conectabitcoin will be available to users in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile, along with Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Uruguay.  Popular product  In its previous incarnation Conectabitcoin was an over-the-counter exchange comparable to Finland-based bitcoin marketplace LocalBitcoins. Beaudroit told CoinDesk that while it had been useful for the community, it didn't pay back as much as he and his partners had hoped.  “Conectabitcoin was really good,” he said. “People were using it a lot, it had an escrow cheaper than the one from LocalBitcoins. But our focus was more on selling the bitcoin ourselves than generating a community where people can connect and buy and sell from each other.”  Conectabitcoin is now going to be powered by Bitex, explained Beaudroit. “Before now they were two products – now, Conectabitcoin is like a simple node of Bitex.”  Bitex will, however, preserve the Conectabitcoin brand name for its new service, since users of both platforms are already familiar and content with Conectabitcoin, he said, adding:  “We think there is a niche of people who would love to get their first bitcoin in the easiest way possible.”  Growing community  One of the service’s greatest assets is that users can cash in and cash out in almost any location in the region, according to Beaudroit. Although other firms in Latin America like BlinkTrade have provided liquidity across the region through stockbrokers, they have done so in each country separately.  “We think that Latin America is going to be one of the biggest [bitcoin] markets in a few years and we’d like to put our chips in the region,” he said.  He added that Bitex had identified a growing interest in bitcoin adoption from “less techy people” and “non-bitcoiners"". The company sees this growing demographic as an opportunity to increase adoption of the digital currency by making access to it as simple as possible.  In its home market of Argentina, where inflation is expected to surpass 30% by the end of the year, the highly volatile peso has driven a black market demand for US dollars and shone some light on bitcoin’s prospects for the economy.  The magnitude of the Argentinean bitcoin community is low for now, Beaudroit said, adding:  “The bitcoin community right now is around 7,000 people. It’s growing all the time and more people in the community are starting to look at bitcoin as a way of buying dollars in some way because they are not pesos. The problem here is people don’t believe in the peso because of all the problems with our economy.”  “People like bitcoin because they can access the free market with a really fancy tool,” he concluded.

42377676,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72yip,1412588841,Coinarch Brings Investment Banking Products to Bitcoin,"Coinarch, an online trading platform based in Singapore, has become the latest in a handful of companies offering derivatives based on bitcoin’s value – including what the firm says is the bitcoin world's first 'reverse convertible' investment product.  The appearance of such investment products is potentially a sign that bitcoin is maturing as a financial market, making activities like hedging easier.  The first product in the firm’s arsenal is the Booster. Designed for people wanting to bet on the rise or fall of bitcoin prices (going ‘long’, or ‘short’), it offers investors leverage to increase their potential gains.  If one person wants to bet on bitcoin prices rising, they buy the coins, with a view to selling them later at a profit. A person going short will borrow the coins, hoping for the price to fall so that they can then buy them at a reduced price later.  Coinarch manages long and short orders itself by buying and selling bitcoins. The company provides up to eight times leverage, meaning that it will boost an investor’s $1,000 position to $8,000 for example, to maximise their profit potential.  “To manage the risk on your position we need to buy eight bitcoins. So we have this line of finance,” says Coinarch co-founder and CEO Jeremy Glaros, who says that the company has raised $250,000 in capital so far. “We also have lines of credit with shareholders.”  He uses this money to buy bitcoins where necessary, from exchanges including Bitstamp and itBit.  Customer accounts are protected using a stop-loss system, which closes out the customer’s position to stop them losing more than their initial investment, Glaros says. The company also charges interest and a gap protection fee to customers.  Earning interest on bitcoins  The more complex product is the Maximiser. This investment vehicle is designed for customers who don’t expect bitcoin prices to rise in the short term, but still want to earn interest on the bitcoins that they hold.  Maximiser offers them the chance to earn up to 50% interest, while also buying bitcoins along the way if the price drops.  Customers investing in the Maximiser set an maturity date for their investment. They also agree to purchase bitcoins at a discount to the market price, known as the ‘strike’, when the investment matures.  The Maximiser then calculates a cash settlement price, which is the original amount invested plus a predetermined interest rate based on the maturity date and the strike.  If the bitcoin price is below the strike when the Maximiser matures, the customer must buy the bitcoins at the strike price. If it finishes higher, they receive the cash settlement.  The Maximiser arrangement exposes the customer to losses should the bitcoin price drop substantially by the Maximiser’s maturity date, but it also gives them a healthy return on their investment should the market stay relatively static.  Profiting from volatility  Glaros explains that Coinarch makes its money on volatility with the Maximiser, using a probability model to determine how many bitcoins it should buy at the market price at set intervals.  The firm’s internal modelling will offer a probability of bitcoin finishing below the strike price, based on the current market price.  For example, when a customer invests in bitcoin at $400 with a strike of 95%, the strike price is $380. At a current market price of $400, there might be a 25% probability that the Maximiser matures below the strike price (although the model is complex and the real probability may be different).  To hedge its risk, at this point the firm buys 25% of a bitcoin (0.25 bitcoins) at that current market price.  If the bitcoin subsequently moves from $400 to $500, then the probability of the price finishing below $380 drops (it might drop to 5% for the sake of example). So the firm only needs 5% of a bitcoin.  To balance things, the firm sells the 20% of a bitcoin that it doesn’t need, but this time at price per BTC of $500, profiting 20% of the $100 price movement.  A bitcoin first  Coinarch makes money on the downside too, Glaros says, because the customer has agreed to buy bitcoins from it at the key price, effectively protecting it.  If the price drops to $200 from $400, the probability of the Maximiser finishing below the $380 strike price is higher (say, for example, 75%). So the firm buys 0.75 bitcoins at the lower price. If the Maximiser does indeed mature below the strike, then the customer must buy those bitcoins from Coinarch for the $380 strike price.  In investment banking circles, the Maximiser is what’s known as a reverse convertible, exposing customers to downside risk in return for potential interest.  Glaros claims it’s the first such security to make its way from the investment banking community into the bitcoin world:  “In essence, a Coinarch user who enters into a Maximiser is taking downside risk in the form of a sold put option and in return receives the elevated level of interest. This is a product offered in huge volumes globally over other asset classes, so we think it is only right that it is available in the world of bitcoin.”  The Maximiser relies heavily on volatility to make money for the provider. Bitcoin’s volatility has shrunk during 2014, perhaps due to greater liquidity. Below is a chart from btcvol.info, which takes its data from CoinDesks’s Bitcoin Price Index:Glaros conceded that Coinarch’s profit potential on convertible notes shrinks as volatility flattens out, explaining:  “What it means is that we adjust the terms and they are less attractive for investors. We could make the case that now is the time to use this sort of thing, but ultimately what we will do is have a range of different options for customers.”  This isn’t the only interest-bearing account in the bitcoin world. Delta Financial offers one, although with a different underlying instrument. BitSavers offers 5%, and Huobi’s BitVC recently opened up internationally.  You can go long or short on bitcoin with Coinarch, or you can sit back and collect the interest in a stable market. But with bitcoin having been in an apparent free-fall recently, it’ll be a brave investor who’d expect the cryptocurrency’s fortunes to stay stable at the time of writing.
