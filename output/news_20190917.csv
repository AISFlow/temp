42387620,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQlva5,1568756401,"VanEck, SolidX Withdraw Bitcoin ETF Proposal From SEC Review","Cboe BZX Exchange withdrew its VanEck/SolidX bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposal on Tuesday.  According to a filing  dated Sept. 17, a proposed rule change to publicly list shares of the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust was withdrawn on Sept. 13. A decision on the proposal had already been delayed a number of times, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) faced a final deadline of Oct. 18 to determine whether to approve or reject what could have been one of the first bitcoin ETFs in the country.  The news comes just weeks after VanEck and SolidX began offering shares of the Trust to qualified institutional buyers (entities with at least $100 million in assets owned or invested) under a Rule 144A exemption. In the nearly three weeks since first announcing the product, one ""basket"" of four bitcoin (worth around $40,000) was traded.  VanEck appears to have changed near-term plans very recently.  In an interview on Sept. 4, VanEck head of ETF product Ed Lopez told CoinDesk that the company would continue to pursue an exchange-traded product, explaining:  ""We still strongly believe the marketplace and many investors would be better served to have a regulated product out there and this is just one small step towards that and right now it happens to be only available to institutions.""  Tuesday's filing marks the second time VanEck and SolidX withdrew the proposed ETF. The companies withdrew the same ETF proposal in January, after a prolonged government shutdown threatened to force a rejection.  The SEC is still reviewing two other bitcoin ETF proposals. One, filed by Wilshire Phoenix, would include both bitcoin and U.S. Treasury bonds in the Trust, and faces an initial deadline at the end of September, while the other, filed by Bitwise Asset Management with NYSE Arca, will be approved or rejected on Oct. 13.  Bitwise most recently announced that BNY Mellon would act as the transfer agent for its ETF.  After this article was published, VanEck director of digital asset strategies Gabor Gurbacs tweeted ""We are committed to support Bitcoin and Bitcoin-focused financial innovation. Bringing to market a physical, liquid and insured ETF remains a top priority. We continue to work closely with regulators & market participants to get one step closer every day.""

42382657,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sZbf,1568753729,CoinDesk to Move Into Same Building as Owner Digital Currency Group,"Employees at cryptocurrency news publication CoinDesk were told Tuesday that the firm is moving into office space in the same building as its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), a transition that will take place in March 2020.  In an email sent to employees, his first ever to CoinDesk's entire staff, DCG founder and CEO Barry Silbert outlined four reasons for the move, vowing that while seeking to create new business synergies with the media company, one of three wholly-owned subsidiaries, the parent would continue to respect and strengthen the editorial independence of the publication, founded in 2013.  The other two subsidiaries, Grayscale Investments and Genesis Trading, work out of the DCG office building in Manhattan.  “We will build a state-of-the-art office,” Silbert wrote. “Essentially, the only teams we won’t meet with are the editorial staff and the content professionals who build the event agendas.”  “We are 100 percent committed to preserving that independence,” he continued.  The lease was signed Tuesday. A representative of the building's owner, the Feil Organization, had previously indicated it expected a deal on the office to close this week.  In his email to employees, Silbert specified that CoinDesk's new offices would be on a separate floor of the building from DCG. The 9,000 square foot space was formerly used by Luminary Media, a podcast streaming platform. CoinDesk has to date operated out of WeWork offices, all in Manhattan.  Still, Silbert was clear that there had been a material change in the dynamic between the two companies, adding:  ""We are committed to investing significant resources into CoinDesk so that we can retain our talent, hire new voices, build great new products, continue to host high-end conferences and continue to produce the best journalism in the industry. But there should be no doubt in anyone’s minds about our view on supporting an influential, truly independent newsroom.""  He said: ""I absolutely believe having CoinDesk in the same building is a critical step for the sustained growth of DCG and CoinDesk.""  A representative for DCG specified that he expects the offices to have their own security passes, which would restrict which floors employees of each company can access.  Internal debates  The decision follows a weeks-long period of opposition from some employees of CoinDesk.  Concerns about the move and its impact on CoinDesk’s ability to operate as an independent publication had been expressed directly to the company's leadership in two signed emails as well as a face-to-face meeting last month.  The move is seen as a break from the historical geographic separation between the two firms, as outlined by CoinDesk’s Editorial Policy, which reads: “We work in separate offices and maintain strict policies on editorial independence and transparency.”  CoinDesk has maintained offices in a separate building from DCG ever since the industry investment firm, which has stakes in more than 145 crypto and blockchain-focused startups, acquired CoinDesk in late 2015 from founder and angel investor Shakil Khan. The firm was subsequently run by CoinDesk Managing Director Ryan Selkis, formerly director of growth at DCG.  He was later succeeded by Kevin Worth, CoinDesk’s CEO.  A preliminary decision to approve the move announced Tuesday was reached on Aug. 14 between Worth and members of DCG.  News of that decision quickly spawned an internal meeting on Aug. 26 at which Worth took questions from CoinDesk staff about the proposed decision. At the time, Worth said he had ""temporarily paused"" the office move, pending a discussion of concerns.  At the meeting, both New York-based and international employees voiced their worries that the move could harm CoinDesk's reputation.  Staffers outlined the potential risk posed to the company in a follow-up letter addressed to Worth, which stated:  “These costs include the possible reputational damage to CoinDesk, a deterioration of reader trust and an opening for competitors to undermine our standing as the industry’s leading news provider. The move would also make it harder for us to recruit and retain top talent, and it would make it more difficult to work with diverse sources across the industry, who may not want to attend a meeting in the same building as DCG.”  Twenty-nine of CoinDesk’s roughly 50 employees signed the email.  In response to that letter, Worth said there was “no specific timeframe” for the decision. “We'll have a chance to talk again at the all hands on Sept. 17,” he said in an email.  On Tuesday, Worth sought to position the finalized move as one that's in the best interest of the company, telling CoinDesk:  “CoinDesk will continue to produce the finest independent journalism in the industry. In preparation for the office move in 2020, earlier today I asked some of our editorial colleagues to form a committee that will recommend specific principles and controls to maintain the complete editorial independence of CoinDesk. I look forward to receiving those recommendations.”  The full email from DCG CEO Barry Silbert can be found below:    Dear CoinDesk Team,      I’ve been a CoinDesk fan since the very beginning.    When the CoinDesk founder, Shakil Khan, approached me in 2013 about investing in a new media company focused on bitcoin and its emerging community, I jumped at the opportunity. Most people believe that media companies are terrible investments – but I believed that a strong, independent publication was essential to the development of this industry.    In 2016, it became clear that CoinDesk was in severe financial trouble and on the verge of extinction. As I was considering an investment, I was yet again advised that acquiring a media company would be a poor financial decision. And, after all, what did I know about building a media business? I ignored the naysayers because I believed in CoinDesk and its essential voice in the industry.    I haven’t worked in news but I know that a media company is only valuable if you have great journalists producing terrific content. I knew that I needed to choose strong leaders and let them build a terrific team with a steadfast commitment to cover the industry with honesty, integrity, and independence. Basically, it’s the same rule I follow with our other businesses – hire smart people and let them do their thing. Today, CoinDesk has grown from a small team that merely aggregated news to a global organization that produces the very best original blockchain journalism in the world.    Kevin informed you this morning that CoinDesk will be moving to a new office in 2020. Yes, the office is located on the 2nd floor of XXXXXX, and yes, that’s the same building where DCG, Grayscale, and Genesis reside on the 5th floor. That’s created concern and anxiety among some of you, with the belief that the dynamic between DCG and CoinDesk has somehow changed.    Well, it has. We are committed to investing significant resources into CoinDesk so that we can retain our talent, hire new voices, build great new products, continue to host high-end conferences, and continue to produce the best journalism in the industry. But there should be no doubt in anyone’s minds about our view on supporting an influential, truly independent newsroom: we are 100% committed to preserving that independence.    I will never tell you what to write, who to cover, or how to write it. Nor will my team. We will not ask you to “go easy” on our portfolio companies, or to coddle DCG and its subsidiaries. And I will never ask you to go easy on me. To the contrary, we recognize that CoinDesk only has value if it remains a truly independent editorial voice.    So why move CoinDesk to XXXXXXX? Several reasons:    We will build a state-of-the-art office. Once complete, CoinDesk will have a broadcast studio, podcast capabilities, and a modern workspace where we believe all of you will excel and thrive as journalists and professionals.    We’re investing resources to ensure that every employee will feel safe in the workplace, with enhanced security measures designed to protect the team.    The DCG team will meet regularly with the CoinDesk business team – product, data, sales, marketing, video, and the leadership team – on business-related issues. Essentially, the only teams we won’t meet with is the editorial staff and the content professionals who build the event agendas (who I view as creating live journalism that is separate from business considerations).    As we continue the evolution of making CoinDesk the essential publication for global investors, several aspects of the business will intersect with DCG. If we decide to make acquisitions that would bolster the data, content, video, or podcast capabilities of CoinDesk, it would be DCG doing the diligence and making the acquisition.    All of this can be done with the right controls and safeguards in place to preserve editorial independence.    There are several examples of parent companies or the business sides of media companies residing in the same building as the editorial team, and successfully navigating the issues that concern you. I absolutely believe having CoinDesk in the same building is a critical step for the sustained growth of DCG and CoinDesk.    This is a fantastic opportunity for ambitious journalists, but each of you will have to make the personal decision about participating in the exciting opportunities on the road ahead. I can’t control the conspiracy theories and perceptions on Twitter, or what sources will say, and neither can you. Conspiracy theories will persist as long as DCG owns CoinDesk and that’s definitely not changing anytime soon. (And trust me, I know all about baseless, irrational Twitter attacks.)    At a time when news organizations are struggling, we’re investing tens of millions of dollars to build an even better media company. We want to compete in the next decade against the premier financial publications in the world; forget the crypto publications, we’re focused on the biggest fish in financial media. I can assure you that we are totally committed to building an outstanding media company for the long term. Our journalists are a big reason we’ve gotten as far we have, and we will need you to take this company to the next level. It’s going to be a fun ride.

42382652,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sZZ9,1568746756,China's Inner Mongolia to Shutter ‘Illegal’ Bitcoin Miners by October,"China’s Inner Mongolia autonomous region is carrying out an inspection to eliminate “illegal” bitcoin mining operations by October, a government spokesman told CoinDesk, confirming a local report.  The official document detailing the inspection plan was leaked to Chinese media which published photos of the decree from the Inner Mongolian regional authority.  “The inspection is directed by the central government, rather than a standalone plan initiated by the local government,” according to an industry executive involved in the planning process.  “The move reflects the nationwide phase-out plan on the bitcoin mining,” the source added. The government’s proposed plan in April, pending final approval, is to drive out the digital currency mining industry from China.  According to the 10-page document, data centers that provide facilities for bitcoin miners and unregistered bitcoin mining businesses will be closed.  The local authorities leading the raids will target any bitcoin mining operation that tries to get preferential electricity prices and tax breaks by pretending to be a sanctioned user, such as a big data company or cloud computing host.  Existing bitcoin mining businesses that pass the inspection will be categorized as “limited companies” that should pay the official electricity rate and not negotiate with power stations directly. They would still be expected to shut down their mining operating in the near future.  The region-wide inspection is being rolled out in two phases.  The municipalities are carrying out the inspections from Sept. 3 to Sept. 25 and then.reporting their findings to the regional government, which will form a team to investigate the findings from each jurisdiction from Oct. 10 to Oct. 20..  Inner Mongolia, in northern China, is among the most suitable areas to operate bitcoin mining businesses thanks to its cheap electricity supply, low land prices, cold weather and a small population.  Such conditions help miners by reducing their biggest cost - electricity - cooling equipment more quickly and avoiding densely populated areas that would be bothered by noisy operating machines. Bitmain, one of the largest bitcoin mining companies, has had operations in the region.  China started to crackdown on bitcoin mining operations before the draft proposal in April by the National Development and Reform Commission, the primary government agency for economic planning.  The NDRC’s position indicated that the mining industry should be phased out of China as it does not fit in the future economic development plan of the country. Trading and possessing cryptocurrencies is illegal in China as part of broader currency controls, but crypto use is prevalent on the black market.

CFTC Chairman Heath Tarbert announced in a press release Tuesday that DeWitt, who is also the exchange's general counsel for business lines and markets, will be the new director of the Division of Market Oversight (DMO), the group responsible for overseeing derivatives platforms and products, including the young market for bitcoin futures.  DeWitt has also spent time at Citadel Securities, S&P Global and Davis Polk & Wardwell, and has previously been a portfolio manager.  Her new role will see her evaluating and potentially approving new bitcoin derivatives products in the U.S. DMO has examined CME, Cboe and Bakkt's various bitcoin futures proposals in the past.  She succeeds former DMO director Amir Zaidi, who oversaw the first bitcoin futures contracts as they entered the crypto space in late 2017.  In a statement, Tarbert thanked Zaidi ""for his more than nine years of service at the CFTC,"" saying:  ""[DeWitt] brings to the CFTC more than 20 years of private sector experience in the financial services and legal fields.

42382647,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sZVN,1568725239,Coinbase-Backed ConsenSys Alum Aims to Build GitHub for Web3,"Although most developers use GitHub to organize and share open-source code, funds like Coinbase Ventures, Distributed Global and Digital Currency Group are betting on a crypto-native alternative.  Former ConsenSys token guru Harrison Hines is now CEO of his own startup, Terminal, which closed a $3.7 million seed round in late 2018 for a developer hub specifically built for decentralized apps (dapps). The hub quietly went live over the summer and is undergoing a soft launch this week.  Unlike the Microsoft-owned GitHub, which requires a quick workaround in order to use smart contracts, Hines told CoinDesk Web3 developers will be able to deploy software directly from the Terminal platform. Projects like MakerDAO stablecoin loans rely on smart contracts (software that automatically executes business logic) to safeguard hundreds of millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency.  “For a large ecosystem like MakerDAO with tons of smart contracts live, Terminal allows us to curate starting points for developers tailored exactly for their needs,” MakerDAO engineer Vamsi Alluri told CoinDesk.  Terminal CTO Janison Sivarajah told CoinDesk this platform was designed for Web3, the shorthand for an internet populated by applications that aren’t hosted or controlled by a single entity.  “Once that smart contract is actually deployed on the blockchain, it is a live object that lives on one of these decentralized protocols,” Sivarajah said. “People need an interface to surface them, view data about them and interact with them. You can’t do that on GitHub.”  Terminal also offers limited node services, for free, and direct conduits to external infrastructure providers like Infura or BlockCypher.  Stepping back, ethereum fans generally use “infrastructure” to mean an external party running nodes and offering blockchain data as a service. Unlike bitcoin, which has plug-and-play hardware node options, most experts agree it is cumbersome to run an ethereum node with full archives. In order for dapps to take off and hit the mainstream, token connoisseurs say, the industry requires more independent node operators and easier access to node data.  “You have to run nodes across all those [testing, production, etc.] environments,” Sivarajah said. “Someone could use the hosted nodes that we provide … because that’s a lot cheaper and easier to get off the ground. But then you can point the production environment to your own infrastructure.”  To be clear, Terminal isn’t looking to compete with ConsenSys-owned API provider INFURA, which served 5,000 daily users as of July 2019, according to INFURA product manager Michael Godsey. Hines told CoinDesk his legal complaint against ConsenSys founder Joseph Lubin, alleging the former employer owed Hines $13 million in unpaid profits and benefits, was resolved amicably out of court.  “We are planning to, hopefully, get every ConsenSys project onto Terminal and using Terminal,” Hines said. “I do think there are opportunities for us to work with several of them in the future.”  Growth plans  Terminal’s freemium business model is predicated on the hope that, like GitHub, some developers will eventually pay for premium support services.  “Alerting and notifications are just one feature in Terminal, but it is a feature we have been exploring the most to assist 0x developers,” engineer Jacob Evans, of the exchange startup 0x, told CoinDesk. “Terminal also has a number of great features that will help support developers at the prototyping and hackathon stage. It's critical that developers can play around and experiment efficiently.”  With regards to such experiments, Sivarajah said Terminal is running roughly seven different nodes to support projects using blockchains like xDAI, Rootstock and POA, in addition to private testnets.  “A contract on ethereum can easily be deployed on any of the other networks that use the EVM [ethereum virtual machine] blockchain,” Sivarajah said, estimating two-dozen networks currently use the EVM. “We will also see which other frameworks are gaining traction.”  Traction will be the deciding factor. Dapp.com data suggests no ethereum-based dapp currently attracts more than 2,000 daily users.  If you build it, will they come?  From the perspective of Distributed Global partner Johnny Steindorff, a Terminal investor, part of this relates to how much manual work is required to maintain reliable Web3 applications.  “I think middleware is one of the biggest present-day opportunities to drive mainstream [blockchain] development and adoption,” Steindorff told CoinDesk.  Indeed, BlockCypher CEO Catheryne Nicholson told CoinDesk that “running ethereum infrastructure is really painful.” Yet her company has thousands of customers, ranging from rogue developer teams to enterprises, paying for such ethereum API access.  With more companies providing affordable support services across the ecosystem, Hines said, startups can avoid that hassle and focus on their core competency. He added that Terminal aims to eventually offer self-hosted versions of the platform for developers who prefer not to rely on centralized websites.  “Most developers need redundancy,” BlockCypher’s Nicholson said, referring to how teams need backups in case one ethereum API provider has a hiccup. “It’s not one company eat all. You need multiple players to make that ecosystem work.”  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Terminal.

Former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo has joined the advisory board to the Chamber of Digital Commerce, a trade group focused on blockchain and crypto policy in the U.S.  Giancarlo helmed the CFTC for two years, following a three-year stint as a commissioner with the agency. Under his watch, the CFTC allowed the first bitcoin futures products to enter the space.  Most famously, Giancarlo told the U.S. Senate Banking Committee that, in his view, ""'do no harm' is the right overarching approach” for the blockchain space. His recommended approach earned him the nickname ""Crypto Dad"" from the community, a moniker he has embraced.  In a statement Tuesday, he said ""the Chamber is at the epicenter of this emerging field of technology that can only be described as a movement,"" adding:  ""I’m looking forward to joining this group of advisory board leaders, from many fields and areas of expertise, whom are already working to promote the adoption of this transformative technology. It is my hope that together we can streamline and modernize the regulatory environment and encourage further blockchain innovation.""  Perianne Boring, the Chamber’s founder and president, said in a statement that Giancarlo would add his ""substantial knowledge"" to the group’s board, citing his experience with the financial markets and his past efforts in ""encouraging advancements in technology.""  ""We are entering a new phase of blockchain advocacy,"" she told CoinDesk. ""As the world’s leaders are convening to discuss the future of the international financial and monetary system, crypto and blockchain are increasingly playing a key role in these discussions. Chris Giancarlo’s valuable expertise will be critical as we continue to move the industry forward.""  The Chamber, founded in 2014, recently celebrated its fifth birthday by inviting its members to meet with members of Congress and Congressional staffers to educate lawmakers about the potential uses and benefits of the technology.  In February, the group called on the U.S. government to develop a national framework for blockchain and cryptocurrency legislation.  The U.S. risks falling behind other nations if it does not, Boring has said in the past.  Since leaving the CFTC, Giancarlo has also joined the board of directors to the American Financial Exchange, an electronic interbank lending system.

42382649,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sZWd,1568722849,Wells Fargo to Pilot Dollar-Linked Stablecoin for Internal Settlement,"U.S.-based financial giant Wells Fargo is developing a U.S. dollar-linked stablecoin that will run on the firm’s first blockchain platform.  Dubbed Wells Fargo Digital Cash, the tokenized dollar will be used in a pilot initially for internal settlement across the company's business.  The firm said in a press release on Tuesday that the digital token will enable to settle internal cross-border payments across its global network. Its international locations will also be able to move funds between each other using the token.  As banking services become increasingly digital, Wells Fargo sees ""a growing demand to further reduce friction regarding traditional borders, and today’s technology puts us in a strong position to do that,” said Lisa Frazier, head of the Innovation Group at the company.  Wells Fargo says its proprietary digital ledger tech (DLT) platform will enable it to move money in ""near real-time"" and ""without impact to the underlying account, transaction postings or reconcilement infrastructure.""  It will also allow the firm's international locations to move funds outside normal operating hours, remove the need for third-party payment intermediaries and cut the time and costs associated with such transactions.  R3's tech  When contacted by CoinDesk, Wells said its DLT is built on Corda Enterprise, the paid-for enterprise version of R3's blockchain technology.  ""R3 Corda Enterprise was designed by and for financial institutions. It is a distributed ledger solution that allows for appropriate data confidentiality controls, scales to bank transaction volumes and throughput, and supports an information security design that is compatible with Wells Fargo’s industry regulated standards,"" said bank spokesman Roger Cabrera.  Obvious parallels can be drawn between what Wells Fargo is testing out and JPMorgan’s JPM Coin and its Interbank Information Network (IIN) which this week added Deutsche Bank to the 300-plus other banks on that network.  This raises the (at times uncomfortable) question of interoperability since the JPM’s interbank payment system and coin are all built on Quorum, the private version of ethereum the bank has open-sourced. Corda and Quorum do not talk to each other.  When asked about this, Cabrera said:  ""Regarding JPM Coin, Wells Fargo Digital Cash runs on a proprietary internal DLT network that is not connected to any other digital cash solutions emerging in the financial services market today.  Timeline  The pilot, slated for next year, will start with transfers of U.S. dollars, but is expected to expand to other currencies. Eventually, it also aims to reach all Wells Fargo branches worldwide.  Frazier said:  “We believe DLT holds promise for a variety of use cases, and we’re energized to take this significant step in applying the technology to banking in a material and scalable way. Wells Fargo Digital Cash has the potential to enable Wells Fargo to remove barriers to real-time financial interactions across multiple accounts in multiple marketplaces around the world.”  Wells Fargo has previously launched other blockchain projects, including a banking prototype and a trade finance platform aimed at the cotton market. It's also invested in blockchain finance startup Axoni.  Over and above internal settlement, the firm says it plans to use its DLT platform for ""multiple"" other applications.

42382677,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sZjD,1568718050,Will Bitcoin's Price Rally After Federal Reserve Rate Cut?,"View  Bitcoin has dived out of a narrowing price range and may see a deeper drop if key trendline support near $10,120 is breached.  Acceptance below $10,120 would expose the recent low of $9,855.  Some notable observers believe the decline may be reversed following Wednesday's Federal Reserve rate cut, although historical data suggests otherwise.  On the higher side, $10,956 (Aug. 20 high) remains the level to beat for the bulls.      Bitcoin is down again, but some observers believe the losses could be reversed after a U.S. interest rate cut expected Wednesday.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value fell to lows below $10,100 yesterday, marking a downside break of the narrowing price range created near $10,300 in the three days to Sept. 15.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $10,150 on Bitstamp, representing a 1.4 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  So, the bears have gained an upper hand in the last 24 hours despite record high miner confidence, and a deeper drop may unfold in the next 24 hours.  The decline, however, could end up trapping sellers on the wrong side of the market, according to some observers, who expect BTC to benefit from an impending 25 basis point U.S. rate cut on Wednesday.  For instance, Nigel Green, founder and CEO of a global financial advisory giant deVere Group, believes the cryptocurrency will pick up a strong bid in response to the Federal Reserve’s rate cut, as the reduction in borrowing costs will lower the yield (return) on the U.S. dollar.  Meanwhile, Anthony Pompliano, founder and partner at Morgan Creek Digital Assets, tweeted in August that BTC could fly high if the Fed rate cuts are followed by a government buying program (quantitative easing).  Former Wall Street Journal trader and journalist Max Keiser also believes the Fed's continued monetary easing would send bitcoin to $100,000.  Rate cuts are inflationary in nature, meaning they reduce the purchasing power of fiat currencies.  Hence, there is a general consensus in the crypto market that Federal Reserve’s monetary easing will bode well for bitcoin, which is deflationary in nature and is set to undergo a mining reward halving (supply cut) in less than a year.  Bitcoin, however, has seldom taken cues from the Fed’s actions in the past. For instance, the Fed hiked rates by 25 basis points in December 2015. That was the first hike since 2006. The central bank delivered another rate hike in December 2016 and hiked rates four times in 2017.  Even so, BTC broke into a bull market with a convincing move above $300 at the end of October 2015 and went on to hit a record high of $20,000 by December 2017.  As such, the probability of BTC responding positively to tomorrow’s rate cut is debatable.  Also, traditional markets have priced in a 25 basis point rate cut and the FX markets will likely dump the U.S. dollar only if the Fed cuts rates by 50 basis points or signals aggressive easing over the near term. In that case, the anti-dollar sentiment may feed into the crypto markets.  Daily and 4-hour charts  Bitcoin fell to $10,060 on Monday, signaling a downside break of the narrowing price range of the back-to-back inside bar candlesticks, as discussed yesterday.  As of now, prices are sitting on the ascending trendline support at $10,120. A break lower would further strengthen the bear grip and allow a deeper drop to $9,855.  On the higher side, the bearish lower high of $10,956 created on Aug. 20 remains the level to beat for the bulls.  That level could come into play if the rising trendline support fuels a price bounce above $10,458 (Friday’s high).  The probability of a downside break is high as last week’s falling wedge breakout on the 4-hour chart (above right) failed to draw bids. In fact, the breakout ended up creating another bearish lower high at $10,458.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42382658,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sZgh,1568716848,BIS Paper Makes Case for 'Embedded' Regulation in Blockchain Markets,"Research from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), often dubbed the ""bank for central banks,"" has come out in favor of building regulation into blockchain-based financial markets.  A working paper authored by Raphael Auer, a BIS economist, suggests that blockchain and digital ledger tech (DLT), alongside asset tokenization, bring new ways for watchdogs to monitor financial risks.  Blockchain, Auer says, enables the decentralized trading of asset-backed tokens, as well as solving financial problems using self-executing smart contracts.  The tech also opens up the possibility of ""embedded supervision,"" – a regulatory framework that allows regulators to automatically monitor a tokenized market by reading its ledger, ""thus reducing the need for firms to actively collect, verify and deliver data.""  However, for that to happen, regulators need to be sure the market data on a distributed ledger is trustworthy.  The paper's introduction states:  ""As data credibility in such markets is assured by economic incentives, supervisors need to ensure that the market's economic consensus is strong enough to guarantee the finality of transactions and resultant ownership positions.""  To address this risk, Auer proposes a design for a ""distributed and permissioned market in which 'blocks' of financial contracts are verified by third parties.""  Verifiers in such a system would lose a predetermined amount of capital if the blockchain is reversed. Threats such as 51-percent attacks have the potential to change or reverse transactions, but require significant resources to take over the blockchain.  The research is said to have determined how much capital the verifiers would have to stake so that it would never be profitable if a third party tried to bribe them into reversing the transaction ledger.  ""As transactions would then be economically final, supervisors could then trust the distributed ledger's data,"" Auer says.  The paper also looks at the legislative and operational requirements for such a scheme to work, and how embedded supervision could be set up to enable low-cost supervision providing a ""level playing field"" for firms of all sizes.

Cryptocurrency exchange Binance, the world's largest by trading volume, has made a strategic investment in Chinese media and data source Mars Finance.  According to a report from Bloomberg citing a press release, the investment amount was not disclosed, but values the company at $200 million.  Aside from Binance, which reportedly made its first strategic investment in China with the round, Beijing-based Mars Finance was also backed by Ceyuan Ventures and Matrixport, a financial services startup founded by co-founder of bitcoin mining firm Bitmain, Jihan Wu.  Discussing the investment, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said:  “We have large respect for data, news and research firms which support the positive growth of the blockchain industry. We will continue to pursue strategic investment opportunities in our mission to bring crypto further mainstream, increase adoption and accessibility, and help the industry grow sustainably.”  The media site was founded by tech entrepreneur Wang Feng in 2018, Bloomberg says, and has previously raised two funding rounds from investors including IDG Capital and the venture subsidiaries of OKCoin and Huobi.  The firm's website indicates it also offers market reports and a VC fund called Consensus Lab (no relation to CoinDesk Consensus).  The news comes as Binance's new U.S. platform prepares to onboard customers in preparation for live trading.

Announced Tuesday, the platform gives investors access to commercial real estate properties, such as upscale hotels, AssetBlock CEO Mike Liddell told CoinDesk. The Algorand blockchain uses the ALGO cryptocurrency, but investors cannot trade their ALGO for real estate stakes just yet.  Liddell told CoinDesk that tokenized properties – including those held by Lodging Capital Partners, AssetBlock’s launch partner – will not go live until mid-October.  AssetBlock’s platform has been in development for over a year, according to Liddell, who said his team approached Algorand’s project managers early in the development process. They chose the Algorand network for its security and efficient network speeds.  Algorand’s fast transaction times are what CEO Steve Kokinos pointed to as the blockchain’s greatest advantage for real estate.  “We have immediate finality. If you start to look at high value assets like real estate, finality – having absolute certainty over who owns that asset – is very important,” he said.  Algorand has benefitted from an infusion of recent capital. Its Algo token sale raised $60 million in June; in August, investment company Algo Capital raised $200 million for investment in Algorand projects.  Kokinos said tokenization improves access to global investments. “I think, at its core, the idea is to use tokenization and decentralized currencies to democratize finance,” he said.  “For a large number of people in the world, there are many different investment opportunities, financial services and other products that aren’t really accessible.”  Real estate image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,ALGO,ALGO | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/09/17/assetblock-launches-tokenized-property-trading-on-algorand-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0a97ac5e09964c31e9e65feac1f71465b2ddf401-2560x1695.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382653,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sZaP,1568692801,The First Yearlong ICO for EOS Raised $4 Billion. The Second? Just $2.8 Million,"The Takeaway:  Block.One's yearlong initial coin offering (ICO) for the EOS blockchain raised a record-breaking $4.1 billion in 2018.  LiquidApps created a second-layer protocol for EOS to offload computing expenses for dapps, which became very expensive just a few months after EOS launched.  In a similarly yearlong ICO, LiquidApps is currently selling DAPP tokens to be used on its new protocol.  However, six months in, LiquidApps had sold only $2.8 million worth of DAPP. After the same amount of time for its sale, Block.One had sold $700 million worth of EOS.      New cryptocurrencies aren't raising money like they once did, even during marathon sales.  In the first half of 2018, the average initial coin offering (ICO) raised $25.5 million, based on data reported by PwC. The biggest ICO of them all, the yearlong EOS offering, closed during that era and raised a whopping $4.1 billion.  But a second ICO that aimed to make EOS more usable and also opted for a yearlong approach hasn't drawn as much investor interest.  LiquidApps is building a second-layer solution for EOS that runs on the company's DAPP token, which has been sold in daily auctions since February 2019. At the end of its 233rd auction cycle on Aug. 19, the DAPP sale had raised just $2.8 million worth of cryptocurrency.  A source with knowledge of the LiquidApps fundraise told CoinDesk:  ""They've done an interesting job and [have been] innovative in learning from the Block.One sale and mechanics in crafting how a fundraise for a project should be done. Where they've struggled is, not just different market conditions, but finding the right investors and participants for their sale that fully understand the value proposition for the project.""  LiquidApps declined to provide comment on the results of its token sale so far, despite multiple attempts by CoinDesk for comment.  For 333 days and 444 sale cycles, 500 million of the 1 billion pre-mined DAPP tokens will be gradually sold off – that's 1.12 million tokens every 18 hours. CoinDesk's analysis is based on the reported price of these tokens in each sale, as shown on the LiquidApps auction site.  The LiquidApps solution is meant to take pressure off the EOS blockchain's RAM system, which has gotten bogged down as computing resources have proven to be the scarce asset on the fourth-largest blockchain by market cap.  Still, the effort seems to be garnering comparably little fanfare. For comparison, six months into the EOS sale, the startup behind it, Block.One, had raised $700 million, according to a December 2017 report by the Wall Street Journal.  This is a different era in crypto, however, and LiquidApps has put out a much more real product than vastly larger ICOs that ended long ago.  Fred Kreuger, creator of the Lynx Wallet, which is built to work well with EOS, told CoinDesk that he was not surprised by more modest returns on the LiquidApps ICO.  Said Kreuger:  ""Most end users and token buyers understand one thing – native tokens for blockchains.""  New era  The company made a conscious decision at the outset not to set a goal for its fundraiser.  ""Our goal with the Token Generation is to bring as many stakeholders into the ecosystem to best establish it for success,"" LiquidApps CEO Beni Hakak told CoinDesk in a February email, shortly before the sale opened. ""As true believers in the free market, we don't involve ourselves with price speculations – there is no technical possibility to combine an auction, like we’re doing, with a capped amount.""  There may be less pressure on LiquidApps to raise a substantial amount due to its close relationship to another well funded ICO, Bancor.  Hakak was the director of operations at Bancor until January of this year, according to his LinkedIn page, which also lists him as the CEO of LiquidEOS, an EOS block producer that CoinDesk previously reported as a project of Bancor itself.  In February, the LiquidApps white paper listed eight people on its founding team, including all three co-authors of the original Bancor white paper: siblings Guy and Galia Benartzi and Eyal Hertzog. Still, according to a Bancor spokesperson, LiquidApps is a distinct and separate company, though one made up of Bancor alums.  That relationship yielded a great deal of skepticism from the broader crypto community. At the outset of the LiquidApps sale, Cornell professor Emin Gün Sirer saw the whole effort as ill-advised.  ""This is an idea that, in the old days, would attract no more than $225K in seed funding from angels and a few VCs, and those VCs would be considered mavericks for taking this on,"" he told CoinDesk in an email before the sale opened, adding:  ""If $4 billion was not enough to yield an EOS network that is functioning smoothly, the thing to do is not to seek additional funds for more work in the same vein, but to question what went wrong with the original design of the RAM market in EOS.""  Why buy DAPP?  RAM is the ready, easy-to-access memory that applications need to work through a given function. Early on, speculators bought up the RAM supply in anticipation that increased popularity of EOS would make it valuable. In fact, it became so pricy that acquiring RAM resources on EOS became prohibitive.  The first product from LiquidApps was vRAM, a way for EOS dapps to offload most of their RAM needs to a second, less expensive layer. To its credit, vRAM was live at the start of the token sale and has been running ever since.  Investing With a Difference (IWAD) runs a node on the LiquidApps network, and one of the companies it worked with to use its services found dramatic savings. Moonlighting, a freelance job site that runs on EOS, would pay $2,000 per day to run all of its transactions on EOS, according to Raman Bindlish of IWAD. Their costs after moving most transactions onto IWAD's deployment of LiquidApps dropped to about $10 per day.  ""We are doing 10,000–20,000 transactions per day, and CPU/NET cost on EOS blockchain is almost minimal,"" Bindlish told CoinDesk. ""So, using LiquidApps framework for RAM, we brought down the cost of each transaction to less than $0.0005 on average.""  Since releasing vRAM, LiquidApps has put out many more useful tools for developers, such as a way to make accounts for free (an EOS account costs a bit of EOS), an oracle system and a time tool, among other things. LiquidApps published a detailed account of progress so far early this year. To access its different services, users pay in DAPP tokens.  Despite doubts about the necessity of its product, launching the solution has led to a network of service providers running its vRAM system and other products. This has created a new income stream for technically proficient teams no longer able to earn enough contributing to consensus on EOS, either as a block producer or standby block producer.  LiquidApps began in an era of expensive RAM. In September of 2018, it was running at roughly $0.80 per kilobyte. For context, at that time, it would cost a developer a few dollars in RAM to add one new user.  Since then, the price of RAM has dropped considerably. As of this writing, a kilobyte of RAM cost about $0.34 in EOS, according to EOS New York.  And EOS, for its part, had a strong first quarter in terms of transaction volume, largely driven by gambling dapps.  Hakak told CoinDesk in February:  ""We believe The DAPP Network should be a separate, complementary ecosystem (economy) to EOS. While EOS Mainnet is where the consensus is established, the DAPP Network is a secondary trustless layer; and having a unique token, the DAPP token, will allow this ecosystem to flourish.""

42382654,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sZeB,1568678402,"Hedera Hashgraph, Touted as High-Speed Blockchain Alternative, Now Live","Hedera Hashgraph has launched its long-awaited public network, backed by some of the world’s largest corporations and promising faster transactions and greater capacity to scale than any blockchain to date.  Since December 2018, the network had been available in a testing environment to a small group of corporations and developers. As of 00:00 UTC Tuesday, anyone can open an account or build a decentralized app (dapp) on the hashgraph, which is similar to a blockchain but uses a different mechanism to achieve consensus about the state of the ledger.  With the public network now live, the Hedera treasury is set to begin distributing the system’s HBAR tokens around 01:00 UTC. The first tokens – more than 379 million – will go to investors who participated in a $124 million crowd sale that took place in three rounds from March 2018 to August 2018.  Another 1.95 million tokens will go to advisors, vendors and other participants on day one. The balance of the 50 billion supply of HBARs is to be released over the next 15 years by the network’s governing council.  Twelve cryptocurrency exchanges and over-the-counter (OTC) desks plan to list HBAR for trading: AlgoZ, BitOoda, Bering Waters, Bittrex, Galaxy Digital, GSR, Liquid, OKEx, OKCoin, OSL, Upbit and xFutures.  A year and a half in the making, the hashgraph stands out from other distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) in several ways. Its creators claim it works more efficiently than blockchains, making it more suitable for enterprises and commerce. Specifically, Hedera says the network can support up to 10,000 transactions per second, compared to 2.8 per second for bitcoin and 15 for ethereum, the two largest blockchains.  “This is the first instance globally of hashgraph being put to the test,” Hedera CEO Mance Harmon told CoinDesk. “It's a different data structure, different technology and looks nothing like a blockchain, but solves the same kinds of problems with better security and better performance.”  Hashgraph proponents also say its proof-of-stake consensus mechanism is fairer than bitcoin’s proof-of-work, allowing transactions to come in the order they were recorded and to all settle in the same amount of time. Hedera’s code is patented rather than open-source, a condition the network says it will enforce to deter copying of the codebase or forking.  Not least of all, Hedera boasts the imprimatur of blue-chip names, with IBM, Boeing, Deutsche Telekom, Tata, Nomura and bank tech vendor FIS represented on its governing council, whose members run nodes and vote on software updates.  Praise and pans  In the lead-up to the launch, Hedera Hashgraph has gained its share of admirers and critics.  Among its fans are Steve Wilson, a principal analyst at emerging technologies advisory firm Constellation Research, who says Hedera’s size is the key to its speed.  While regular blockchains are a couple of gigabytes large, the hashgraph is smaller because it does not store all transaction history on the ledger (though it can be optionally stored on a ""mirror"" network). In addition to its speed, the hashgraph promises finality and instant payments as opposed to around 70 percent of transactions settling every ten minutes for bitcoin and a handful of transactions never reaching finality, Wilson said.  “If we think crypto is going to be viable for retail transactions, it’s not acceptable for you to walk out with the merchant unsure if they’ll get paid,” he said. “Hedera has a quality of service that others are not as committed to.”  That speed, however, only applies to certain kinds of transactions, said Eric Wall, the former blockchain lead at Nasdaq-owned fintech vendor Cinnober.  “A dapp requires smart contracts and since Hedera is currently throttling 10 transactions per second with smart contracts, then it doesn’t make this any more interesting than ethereum,” said Wall, who recently wrote a pair of skeptical Medium posts about Hedera.  Hedera’s consensus service is also nothing new, Wall maintained. Sidechains have also been created off of public blockchains that take advantage of the consensus strength of the underlying system.  “I can’t predict the future of what Hedera will transition to in the future, but moving away from a model that is based on economic and game theory guarantees to a trusted model is a severe reduction in the neutrality model of the system,” he said.  Link to private networks  Since October, hundreds of developers have been building on the network and 25 are now running dapps that were integrated into the mainnet prior to launch, Harmon told CoinDesk.  Nevertheless, the hashgraph is considered to be in a beta testing phase because the network still lacks the Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) and a few other features which will be included in version 1.0.  The HCS is to serve as a link between private blockchain networks and the hashgraph. It allows a hash of transactions from another network to be ordered in the Hedera network by time, showing a searchable record of when transactions occurred with the trust of a decentralized network.  For example, Certara, a drug development and decision-support company, plans to use the HCS to create “tamper-proof” recording of health data transactions while using a private network like Hyperledger Fabric to ensure privacy, said Jim Nasr, vice president of technology and innovation at Certara subsidiary Synchrogenix.  The HCS will also allow Fabric to run on top of mirror nodes that provide insights into all the transactions flowing over the hashgraph but do not participate in the consensus mechanism like a regular node.  “Getting computational trust is why you want to go down the blockchain path for healthcare,” Nasr said. “With the consensus service, your transactions finalize on the mainnet yet can still leverage a private blockchain.”  Hedera Hashgraph co-founders Leemon Baird and Mance Harmon, image courtesy of the firm.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/09/17/hedera-hashgraph-touted-as-high-speed-blockchain-alternative-now-live,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/99e2c6f65ff22a1c702444ad4ead95a3168da554-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
