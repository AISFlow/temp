Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $$67,523.28  Ether (ETH): $4,819.13  Market moves  Bitcoin rose over 7% during the past 24 hours. The No. 1 cryptocurrency by market capitalization had passed $67,500 on Monday at the time of publication to break its previous all-time high of $66,974.77 on Monday. Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, also hit a record high of over $4,800.  As bitcoin’s prices increased, the funding rates on major exchanges Binance and OKEx, or the cost of holding long positions in the perpetual futures on the exchanges, also elevated on Monday, according to data from coinglass. (Exchanges calculate funding rates every eight hours.) CoinDesk previously reported that rising funding rates are usually a sign that the market is becoming overheated.  Tokens associated with layer 1 blockchains that are similar to the Ethereum blockchain will continue to be worth monitoring on Tuesday because several of them – terra, solana and avalanche – hit record highs in the past two days. Many layer 1 blockchains are holding major events in the coming days – for example, Polkadot’s hotly anticipated parachain auctions on Nov. 11 – that could boost their tokens’ prices, too.  “Retail and traditional investors lack the resources and skills necessary to analyze the wide variety of complex individual application tokens, so the tokens of layer 1 blockchains have essentially become the ‘lazy man’s index’ – a catch-all solution for betting on the overall growth of digital assets,” Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at fund manager Arca, wrote in his latest blog post on Monday.  Technician’s take  Bitcoin Holds Support at $60K-$65K, Testing All-Time High  Bitcoin broke above a short-term downtrend and broke its record high. At the time of publication, bitcoin’s price had broken $67,500. The cryptocurrency rose more than 7% over the past 24 hours.  Upside momentum is improving after a two-week consolidation phase of between $60,000 and $64,000. A confirmed breakout from that consolidation would require at least two consecutive daily closes above $66,900.  Indicators suggest further upside for BTC’s price, initially toward the $86,000 resistance level. Seasonal strength in the fourth quarter could support continued bullish activity over the next two months.  For now, intraday charts appear to be overbought into Asian trading hours, although pullbacks should remain limited given strong support at around $60,000.

The company noted that in the third quarter, it rolled out the ability for its U.K. customers to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, and also launched a program for its credit card customers to automatically purchase crypto from their Venmo account using cash back earned from their card purchases.  The company has reported in the past that customers who purchased crypto through the platform have been logging into PayPal twice as often as they were before they could buy crypto.

The cryptocurrency was up about 5% over the past 24 hours, indicating a rise in bullish sentiment.  Equities and cryptocurrencies are rising as central banks in Europe and the U.S. appear to be in no rush to raise interest rates. Despite plans to ease monetary stimulus, market participants generally view low interest rates as supportive for assets deemed to be risky.  Still, once seasonal strength for cryptos and equities fade, next year could be difficult for risk assets.  “The Federal Reserve has started gently reining in its bond purchase program, and could well tighten more sharply in the months to come, potentially triggering a mini sell-off,” Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, a British financial services company, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  “What is particularly worrying is that many investors get caught up in the fear of missing out on rapid price gains and have borrowed money to invest in highly risky strategies,” Streeter wrote.  Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $66,091.48, +5.33%  Ether (ETH): $4,764.83, +2.9%  S&P 500: 4,701.70, +0.1%  Gold: 1,824.30, +0.44%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.498%  For now, charts suggest further upside in bitcoin if a breakout above $66,000 is confirmed this week. “Bitcoin has ample room to rise on the technical analysis side, as the bulls have built-up strength during the first cryptocurrency’s month-long consolidation,” Alex Kuptsikevich, a market analyst at FxPro, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  Ether option volumes rise  Despite lower trading volume in the spot market, ether’s option volumes have risen to their highest level since May. Increased trading activity in the option market has coincided with a breakout in ETH to an all-time high of around $4,700.  “Option volumes generally increase when markets turn volatile and traders take directional bets as buyers of options have a potential to earn high gains while keeping their losses limited (due to a non-linear option payoff),” crypto research firm Kaiko wrote in a blog post.  “However, despite low levels of volatility, option volumes recently hit their highest level since May,” Kaiko wrote.  Altcoin roundup  Shiba Inu snaps five-week winning trend: Popular meme token shiba inu (SHIB) recently hit a new record, with speculative fervor in the token reaching unprecedented levels, CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reported. The number of addresses that acquired the cryptocurrency within 20% of the all-time high climbed sixfold in the eight days ended Nov. 2, amounting to 12% of the total count of non-zero addresses. The last time a spike like that occurred was in May, and it paved the way for a 90% crash of the token.  Sequoia invests in DeFi project Parallel: Sequoia Capital is backing a seven-figure funding round for decentralized finance lending platform Parallel, CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson reported. The funding values Parallel, a Polkadot blockchain-based protocol, at $250 million. Parallel is building a crypto network that hasn’t fully launched yet. The round comes less than two weeks after Sequoia pledged to restructure its investing playbook in part to more aggressively court crypto startups, similar to what fellow venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz is doing.  Banking industry likely to capitalize on stablecoin deposit demand: Morgan Stanley’s lead cryptocurrency strategist, Sheena Shah, said in a report that the banking industry will most likely try to capitalize on the demand for stablecoin deposits on the back of the market’s exponential growth, CoinDesk’s Will Canny reported. One reason is that the coins provide access to crypto-deposit interest rates and decentralized finance. Crypto lenders offer over 5% interest on some of the coins, which will cause regulators and governments to respond, the report said. Shah added that cryptocurrencies are trading “similarly to risky assets.”  Relevant News  Crypto Mining Stocks Rally After Bitcoin Surges Near Record, Ether Hits All-Time-High  BlockFi, Neuberger Berman File for Spot Bitcoin ETF  Mastercard Launches Crypto-Linked Payment Cards in Asia Pacific  Argo Blockchain Files to Raise Up to $57.5M in Senior Notes  Maple Finance Launches Permissioned Institutional Lending Pool With BlockTower, Genesis  Other markets  Most digital assets in the CoinDesk 20 ended the day higher.

Among the crypto miners, Marathon Digital led the surge on Monday, with the stock soaring almost 20%, while peer Riot Blockchain climbed 17%.  Other miners such as Bit Digital, Bitfarms, Hive Blockchain, Hut 8, Cleanspark, Sphere 3D and Greenidge Generation each rose more than 10%. Meanwhile, Stronghold, Argo and Cipher’s shares were each up more than 5%.  The share prices of miners are most leveraged to the price of cryptocurrencies, since their main source of revenue comes from mining the coins and holding them on their balance sheets.  With bitcoin prices climbing above $60,000, miners big and small continue to make profits, leading to a surge in capital flowing into the sector and more companies delving into mining.  “With current BTC mining margins north of 90%, capital is aggressively flowing into the sector, which we expect to make BTC mining more institutionalized,” said BTIG analyst Gregory Lewis in a research note.  Moreover, Lewis highlighted that the breakeven cost, in terms of electricity, for miners can range from anywhere between $5,000 to $14,000 per bitcoin, implying a heightened profit margin level for miners minting coins at current bitcoin prices.  To put the profitability margin in context, one of the largest bitcoin miners, Marathon Digital, said in a September presentation that its mining cost is about $5,612 per bitcoin, with margin of about 85%, when all of their mining rigs get deployed.  Another crypto-linked stock, MicroStrategy Inc., which is often seen as a proxy for bitcoin, climbed about 9%, while crypto exchange Coinbase Global gained 7% and Robinhood Markets, where many users trade crypto, was mostly flat on Monday.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/08/crypto-mining-stocks-rally-after-bitcoin-surges-near-record-ether-hits-all-time-high,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e635259ca84f25b9c79d1ac619c7b998100a483f-1500x867.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Crypto lenders offer over 5% interest on some of these coins, which in turn will cause regulators and governments to respond, Morgan Stanley said.  Stimulus from governments and central banks have led to risky assets reaching all time highs and cryptocurrencies are no different, Shah said. Cryptocurrencies are trading “similarly to risky assets” with the support from the leverage growth in their markets, she added.  Shah notes that “institutional investor interest in participating in the upward price momentum is building,” adding that bitcoin’s dominance is slipping as “alternative coins outperform due to their lower [U.S. dollar] prices and potential use cases.”  “The battle of the blockchains” is likely to continue as each picks up market share, Shah said, noting that stablecoin issuance has risen 20 times since 2020.

42424340,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2nVvh,1636408878,"Shiba Inu Sees Record Speculative Frenzy, Snaps 5-Week Winning Trend","Speculative fervor in popular meme token shiba inu (SHIB) recently reached unprecedented levels, reprising the retail frenzy observed ahead of May’s price crash.  The number of addresses that acquired the cryptocurrency within 20% of the all-time high price climbed sixfold to a record 116,560 in the eight days to Nov. 2, amounting to 12% of the total count of non-zero addresses, according to data provided by blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock.  The spike in so-called “All Time Highers” addresses tracked by IntoTheBlock indicates a rush to buy the cryptocurrency near the lifetime price high – a sign of fear of missing out (FOMO) among traders. FOMO is often observed in the last leg of the bull markets.  “Last time this pattern emerged in shiba inu in May, SHIB dropped by 90%,” IntoTheBlock said in its weekly newsletter published Sunday.  That said, past performance is no guarantee of future action. As the old saying goes, markets can stay irrational longer than sellers can stay solvent.  So SHIB’s record number of all-time highs doesn’t imply a crash is imminent. However, it does serve as a fairly accurate indicator of the degree of speculative action taking place, as IntoTheBlock noted. Savvy investors typically reduce long exposure whenever signs of retail FOMO emerge.  The self-proclaimed dogecoin killer fell 15% last week, ending a five-week rally that saw prices rise nearly 10-fold to $0.00008870.

Microsoft is a key player whose contributions have advanced the entire ecosystem. I chose to make this move now because I believe Square is primed to take Decentralized Identity technology into new areas that will help drive adoption,” Buchner tweeted on Monday.  “I need to dig into Square’s use cases before discussing specifics, but going in, my intent is to leverage the great work the Decentralized Identity community has already done wherever it makes sense for Square. I am excited to start this new journey and will share more when I can,” he continued.  The emerging field of decentralized identity offers an open-source, standards-based ecosystem for identifying individuals, organizations and devices through self-owned and independent IDs. Decentralized Identity could free users from having to use a mess of passwords, emails, text messages and authentication apps to verify identity.  Earlier this year, Microsoft’s Decentralized Identity team launched the ION Decentralized Identifier (DID), which uses Bitcoin’s blockchain to create digital IDs for authenticating identities online. ION uses the same logic as Bitcoin’s transaction layers to verify an identity. A public key and its private key are used to confirm that the user owns the ID.  Square hasn’t publicly detailed its decentralized identity plans. but the payments firm isn’t new to crypto. Square launched its peer-to-peer payment service Cash App in 2013, and late last year, added the ability to get bitcoin back on purchases. Last week, the company disclosed that Cash App generated $1.82 billion in bitcoin revenue during the third quarter. The company plans to release a white paper on Nov. 19 outlining TBD, its new division for creating an open platform to build a decentralized bitcoin exchange.

42424326,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2nVXh,1636403358,"Coinbase’s Q3 Crypto Trading Volumes to Be Key for Investors, Analysts Say","Coinbase Global Inc.’s (COIN) trading volumes and revenue will likely be the focus of investor attention as the cryptocurrency exchange gets set to report third quarter financial results Tuesday after the market close.  “Coinbase’s platform trading volumes are a key metric given the majority of company revenue comes from retail and institutional trading fees,” John Todaro, a research analyst at New York-based Needham & Co. who has a buy recommendation on the stock, told clients in a note.  Coinbase posted trading volume of $462 billion in the second quarter, its second ever as a public company, up from $335 billion in the first quarter. Mizuho Securities expects that figure to fall to about $315 billion in the third quarter.  Coinbase warned in last quarter’s earnings report that monthly transacting users and trading volume would be lower in the third quarter compared to the second quarter, citing lower volume levels stemming from a drop in crypto asset prices in the quarter. “August month-to-date, retail [monthly transacting users] and trading volume levels have slightly improved compared to July levels but remain lower than earlier in the year,” Coinbase wrote. The company also slightly lowered its yearly forecast range for monthly active users to 5.5 million to 8 million from the previous range of 5.5 million to 9 million.  What’s next?  The recent jump in the price of bitcoin could aid Coinbase’s commissions, though Wall Street remains divided on Coinbase’s prospects moving forward. Mizuho Securities analyst Dan Dolev wrote recently that Coinbase’s “over-reliance” on trading commissions leaves the firm exposed to long-term take rate compression and industry competition. Still, about two weeks ago, Dolev boosted his overall revenue estimates for Coinbase’s third quarter, citing higher bitcoin prices and increased volatility. Mizuho has a neutral recommendation on the shares.  At least one analyst is urging investors to overlook quarterly trading fluctuations and focus on the larger industry trends.  “Some of the near-term themes have similarities to HOOD [Robinhood] as trading engagement slowed in the quarter from a record first half, deflating some of the first-half enthusiasm,” JMP Securities’ Devin Ryan told clients in an early October research note. “This near-term focus misses the bigger story around the ongoing rapid evolution of the crypto economy, growing use cases for crypto and Coinbase’s value proposition,” Ryan added.  Meanwhile, Coinbase said last week it was testing a no-fee trading subscription service for users, which could be discussed more on this quarter’s conference call as rivals, including Robinhood, offer commission-free crypto trading.  Overall, analysts are calling for Coinbase to report $1.57 billion in revenues for the third quarter, down from $2.23 billion in the second quarter, and adjusted earnings per share of $1.73, down from $6.42 in the second quarter, according to FactSet.  Coinbase shares were up about 5% to $354 on Monday and are up more than 40% from their reference price of $250. But they are still down from their opening trading price of $381.

42424322,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2nVPh,1636400703,House Sends Infrastructure Bill With Crypto Tax Provision to US President,"The U.S. House of Representatives voted to pass a bipartisan infrastructure bill that contains a controversial cryptocurrency tax reporting requirement.  The House voted in favor of the bill with at least 218 ayes late Friday night, fulfilling a key priority for the Biden administration amid controversy over whether an accompanying Democrat-led bill would also move forward. The Senate originally passed the bill in August after lawmakers shot down any attempts at amending the crypto provision.  The bill now goes to U.S. President Joe Biden for his signature.  The crypto industry was concerned about a tax reporting requirement within the bill that sought to expand the definition of a broker for Internal Revenue Service purposes. The reporting requirement would see all brokers report transactions under the current tax code.  Industry proponents worried the definition would be too broad, capturing entities like miners and other parties that don’t actually facilitate transactions.  Another provision included in the bill to amend tax code section 6050I has also stoked fear in the crypto industry. The law, written nearly 40 years ago to apply to in-person cash transactions over $10,000, essentially requires recipients to verify the sender’s personal information and record his or her Social Security number, the nature of the transaction and other information, and report the transaction to the government within 15 days.  Unlike other tax code violations, violations of 6050I are a felony, and some lawyers have pointed out that, applied to cryptocurrencies and other digital assets like non-fungible tokens (NFT), it would be nearly impossible to comply with the law.  Pushback against the provision held up the bill’s passage in the Senate, where the infrastructure bill originated, giving the industry a chance to push for an amendment to modify the language. Ultimately, however, the Senate passed the bill without adopting any amendments, despite an 11th-hour effort to secure a change.  The Treasury Department still has to explain how it plans to interpret the bill, and publish guidance spelling out how businesses or other entities will have to comply with it.

S2F Popularizer PlanB Sticks To $98k Target For November Back in June, when Bitcoin was below $34k, analyst PlanB put out a list for his targets of the crypto in the subsequent months. The tweet had these targets for BTC: Aug &gt;47K, Sep &gt;43K, Oct &gt;63K, Nov &gt;98K, and Dec &gt;135K. So far, all these price goals have been decently accurate. But the real challenge will be the current month of November as the target for it is quite bold. PlanB has used the stock-to-flow model for the predictions. S2F is based on the ratio between the current supply (stock) and the annual production (flow). The S2F value shows how scarce Bitcoin is at a particular time. Based on this scarcity, the model uses a formula to predict the future price of the coin. Here is the latest chart for this BTC price model: Bitcoin price vs the line predicted by the S2F model | Source: buybitcoinworldwide As the above chart shows, the model has been remarkably close to the real thing so far, although there were a few points of deviation.

42421685,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXp9Nl,1636396629,Not Everything Needs to Be ‘on the Blockchain’,"Ever since the word “bitcoin” wormed its way into the mainstream, people have been obsessed with putting things “on the blockchain.” There’s an army of crypto influencers and snake oil peddlers out there dedicated to promoting this stuff: real estate on the blockchain, social media on the blockchain, Soundcloud rap on the blockchain.  It makes sense, in a way – smart contracts let you put any sort of computer program on the blockchain, and shiny new tech can be an attractive angle for investors. But how much of the tech we already use today really needs a crypto component?  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The latest case of crypto overreach comes from an investor named Greg Isenberg, who operates a design studio-cum-investment fund called Late Checkout. He used to run a social startup called Islands, which – in a miracle of good timing – he sold to WeWork in the summer of 2019, just before the workspace juggernaut’s fall from grace.  In a tweet last week, Isenberg suggested that recruiters put their hiring processes on the blockchain. Unfolding over the course of a few halting lines, the post reads like a bad prose poem:  How it will work:  - You apply for a job  - It scans the blockchain and rates your set of on chain experiences and credentials  - If above a certain rating, you’re hired within 60 seconds  No prejudice, no wasted time, no pain  Just a quick yes or no  This is a big deal  Similarities to China’s social credit system aside, the idea is almost too easy to trash. That’s because we already have a system in this vein, without a crypto component, and it doesn’t work.  “Automated resume screening” – a computer program meant to separate the good candidates from the bad, without the need for human discretion – is a notoriously ineffective framework. A report from Harvard Business School earlier this year outlined how so-called Applicant Tracking Systems and Recruiting Management Systems are trained to maximize efficiency rather than seek the best candidates. Though they’re “vital,” according to the study, they contribute to a “broken” hiring market.  There’s a danger in reducing human beings to data on a spreadsheet: a GPA, an SAT score, a Boolean value set to “true” or “false” depending on whether an applicant graduated from a four-year college.  Read more: Do You Need to Go to College to Work in Crypto?  Of course, Isenberg was just spinning his wheels for a sympathetic audience. Most of the influencers on “Crypto Twitter” are very obviously biased – deep-pocketed investors with a financial stake in promoting this tech, or crypto enthusiasts looking for ways to get richer.  And yet the more investors start to buy into these dangerous ideas, the more they start to look like reality. It doesn’t matter whether consumers actually want to live in Mark Zuckerberg’s metaverse; we may end up there anyway, because that’s where the money is.

But when it comes to stablecoin development, “that is not what you want,” according to Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu.  In an interview with CoinDesk TV Monday, Hsu, who is the administrator of the U.S. federal banking system and CEO of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), argued that when dealing with people’s money, having too many innovators in the field poses risks.  “You want your money to be stable and reliable, you want it to be there in good times and bad times and not have to think about it,” Hsu said. “If you innovate too much in that space, you’re going to get a wide range of outcomes that some of which are not going to be good.”     Hsu spoke in the wake of a recent report released by the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets that recommended stablecoin issuers should be regulated like banks. Many in the crypto industry argue such a move would unfairly single them out.  But Hsu said vulnerable populations could be at risk without stronger safeguards.  “We want to be really careful about who is in this space and why, and what the risks for them are,” he said.  Hsu cited a July-August poll by Morning Consult in which 37% of respondents who were underbanked said they own cryptocurrency compared to only 10% of banked consumers.  “There is some risk that folks who are least able to bear it lose their money,” he said. “And I think we want to be really careful.”  Another reason for caution is the risk of too many investors trying to redeem their stablecoins for cash at once, leaving the issuer unable to honor its obligations, a risk that necessitates ever-more transparency from stablecoin issuers.  “I have personally been in situations with either banks, non-banks, money funds and others where there’s the question of what’s there, and the inability to answer that question confidently is what leads to the run,” Hsu said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/08/too-much-innovation-is-dangerous-with-stablecoins-occ-chief-hsu,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6b3e80b12c73f786f6f24a96778ae088c21df608-913x528.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

SDX declined to comment.  A go-live date has been a long time coming for SDX, fraught with delays and changes of leadership along the way.

Founded by a team of crypto veterans and former Gemini engineers, Meow said it is focused on developing a compliant-first approach to corporate treasury participation in crypto markets. The company says it can offer an alternative approach to those worried about the risks of inflation, as well as provide crypto-sourced yield in fiat (USD), which is the way corporate treasurers are used to operating.  How it works  Corporate treasuries deposit cash and Meow partners with institutional crypto lending desks to make short-term high yield loans. Meow then collects yields and passes part of the returns back to its customers, who can access the funds within three business days.  “There are really innovative ways to potentially get higher yields on your cash from the cryptocurrency markets. Some of those are trading desks in the space … and some are decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols,” Meow co-founder and CEO Brandon Arvanaghi told CoinDesk in an interview. “Right now, to participate with these folks you need all sorts of bells and whistles. You need to custody your own funds. You need cryptocurrency wallets. Just a bunch of nonsense that nobody wants to deal with, especially corporate treasurers.”  On the other hand, Arvanaghi pointed out that corporate treasurers understand cash. “They want to deposit cash and take advantage of these potentially higher yields. That’s what we offer,” said Arvanaghi.  What’s next  Meow is currently in an early access stage of onboarding initial customers, but the company says it’s ready to scale now.  The company currently partners with two banks, Signature and Silvergate, and is in talks with “several” more banks to build out its network.  Meow anticipates raising additional funding in a Series A in the near future.  “We have not even mentioned that [Series A] letter to investors. It’s just there’s a lot of organic demand, which we’re blessed to be getting,” said Arvanaghi.

Peter Johnson, a partner at Jump Capital, will serve on Notabene’s board of directors.  Crypto exchanges Luno and Bitso, which are Notabene customers, also took part in the round alongside BlockFi, Gemini Frontier Fund, Illuminate Financial, CMT Digital, Fenbushi Capital and ComplyAdvantage CEO Charlie Delingpole. Existing investors Castle Island Ventures and Green Visor Capital also participated.  Crypto compliance has become a sub-sector within the blockchain industry, driven by the likes of global AML watchdog the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Notabene is one of a band of firms focused on helping cryptocurrency exchanges and trading desks become compliant with things like the “travel rule,” a customer-data sharing requirement bringing crypto in line with banks.  That said, Notabene CEO Pelle Braendgaard points out his company’s mission is not to solve travel rule compliance. It’s really about a bigger picture, he said, which is enabling trusted transactions between people and businesses.  “Compliance is the first part, because regulators want to know you’re not interacting with some North Korean general,” said Braendgaard in an interview. “But for crypto to take off we need to use it for everyday transactions. Like if I’m ordering something off Amazon, I want to know that it’s Amazon I paid. So, the travel rule can be seen as a catalyst to bring this layer to crypto.”  As regulatory organizations like the FATF try to encompass crypto’s avant-garde realm of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), service providers like Notabene – born out of the ConsenSys-backed identity startup uPort – were built with decentralized applications (dapps) in mind, said Braendgaard.  “How do we talk about identities in the context of a smart contract or a dapp or anything like that?” Braendgaard said. “Where the parties to a transaction may be intermediated through a smart contract, how do those parties know who they’re interacting with, and how can that be done in a privacy preserving way?”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/08/cryptocurrency-aml-specialist-notabene-raises-10m,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7a4c055ff68731058bdf77d79bd670a4e2487671-2000x1339.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol announced the pool on Monday morning in collaboration with investment firm BlockTower Capital and prime brokerage Genesis (Genesis is owned by Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk’s parent company).  Sanat Rao, a general partner at BlockTower and the head of its Gamma Point Capital market neutral fund, said that the pool is an initial step towards addressing a massive, underserved market.  “The whole opportunity is, how do you bridge the crypto world and the ‘real’ world, or the traditional finance world? There’s $10 trillion in corporate bonds every year, there’s 50 million small-to-medium sized enterprisesin India [alone]and there’s a $300 billion credit gap there,” he said. “Crypto lenders lending to real-world borrowers – we’re excited about DeFi being able to bridge that gap.”  Maple allows users to issue un-or-undercollateralized loans to known entities based on reputation, rather than the traditional model in DeFi which relies on collateral that can be slashed in the event of underpayment. The BlockTower pool is Maple’s first permissioned pool and the protocol’s fourth overall. Current borrowers from other pools include Alameda Research, Framework Labs and Wintermute Trading, among others. The protocol currently has $282 million in total value locked (TVL), which is the U.S. dollar value of the cryptocurrency committed to the protocol.

The partnership comes after Atlas signed a 100-megawatt “colocation capacity” deal with U.S.-based Compute North on Oct. 19, which will expand Atlas’s hashrate, or computing power, to over 3 EH/s starting in the first quarter of 2022.

In fact, according to a Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance study published in October, the U.S. accounted for about 35% of the total bitcoin mining hashrate, while Canada contributed almost 10%, setting up North America as the dominant region for bitcoin mining following China’s moves.

The round, which values the Polkadot-based protocol at $250 million, comes less than two weeks after Sequoia pledged to restructure its investing playbook to, in part, more aggressively court crypto plays. Fellow venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) did the same in 2019; it now raises multibillion-dollar funds exclusively for crypto.  Whether Sequoia will move as aggressively as a16z is unclear, though the investment in Parallel speaks to a willingness to invest in early-stage crypto teams.  Parallel is building a fast-growing project on Polkadot, a crypto network that is not yet fully launched.  “We are incredibly excited about the vision and potential of DeFi,” Sequoia Partner Josephine Chen said in a statement. Chen said Parallel is positioned to help “legacy firms” more readily engage in the space.  Parallel is one of the many projects building DeFi toolkits for retail and institutional crypto clients. The startup raised in August at a $150 million valuation. The project has increased its user base 400% in the months since, Parallel founder Yubo Ruan told CoinDesk.

Every passing month seems to smash another record, and the hype isn&apos;t slowing down. It seems like the $69 million Christie&apos;s auction of Beeple&apos;s &apos;Everydays: The First 5,000 Days&apos; in March sent a shockwave through the world whose butterfly effect has reverberated into $10.7 billion worth of NFTs bought and sold during Q3 2021. NFTs are taking the world by storm, and they seem like a perfect match for another blockbuster trend that began trending across the planet decades ago: anime.

The exchange, which was founded in China and received a Gibraltar operating license in 2018, is likely looking for a new home away from Chinese regulators. Huobi moved significant portions of its operations to Singapore when Chinese regulators launched a renewed crackdown on crypto trading on Sept. 24, CoinDesk reported. It later announced it would expel its Chinese users.  The exchange will be migrating its existing spot trading users, tech infrastructure and cloud hosting to a licensed entity in Gibraltar, a Huobi spokesperson told CoinDesk via email.  Huobi currently has “no plans to move the majority of its operations” to the territory, but might add staff to Gibraltar operations “depending on how the [user] migration goes,” the spokesperson said.  Huobi will serve global customers from its Gibraltar base, the spokesperson said. The company claims to be pursuing a “decentralized” global structure with no particular headquarters.  A Huobi subsidiary, Huobi Technology (Gibraltar) Co. Ltd., received a distributed ledger technology license (DLT) from the GFSC, which allows the company to use DLT technology to store or transmit value belonging to others, the press release said.  In addition to these services, Huobi Gibraltar is also allowed to “operate a secondary market venue for trading virtual assets” and provide brokerage services, according to the GFSC registry.  This is the first time Huobi Global will move its spot trading services to a regulated entity, the press release said. The exchange believes that operating under a licensed entity will appeal to institutional investors, according to the release.  The Gibraltar entity was previously a crypto brokerage for institutional investors and high net worth individuals, and also provided retail over-the-counter trading services, according to the press release. It was incorporated in 2017, according to the GFSC registry.  Gibraltar is a British Overseas Territory located at the southernmost tip of the Iberian peninsula, where Spain and Portugal are located.  Huobi co-founder Du Jun told the Financial Times on Monday that 30% of the exchange’s revenue comes from China.

The cryptocurrency topped $66,000 during the European hours and appeared set to challenge the record high of $66,975 reached on Oct. 20, CoinDesk data shows. Ether, the native token of Ethereum’s blockchain, also broke its previous record early Monday; its price briefly passed $4,700 around 1:00 UTC, according to CoinDesk data. Bitcoin is the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, whereas ether, is the second largest.  Yuya Hasegawa, crypto market analyst at Japan’s exchange bitbank, said sinking real or inflation-adjusted bond yield may be powering bitcoin higher. “Real yields sliding due to inflation fears may have caused the recent BTC rally,” Hasegawa told CoinDesk in an emailed statement. Data from the U.S. Department of Treasury shows the 10-year real yield dipped to -1.09% on Friday, the lowest since Aug. 30.  Bitcoin is widely perceived as a store of value asset like gold. While Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated last week that price pressures may be transitory, fear persists of inflation running out of control.  “The inflation narrative still dominates the headlines and people are feeling the pinch globally,” Coinbase said in its weekly email on Friday. “Whether it’s gas prices in the U.S., energy prices in Europe or food prices in Latin America, the headwinds of supply chain constraints and a shrinking labor force has investors looking for a store of value.”  On-chain data also show bullish signs for bitcoin in the medium term, said Eddie Wang, senior analyst at OKLink research, crypto exchange OKEx’s on-chain data research arm. The network’s hashrate, or computing power, has been steadily increasing since July, the mining difficulty, a metric that describes how difficult it is for miners to find new bitcoin blocks and earn rewards, has also increased eight times, and miners have accumulated over BTC 3,000 in their wallets since September, Wang said.  The number of unique wallets with a balance of more than zero has returned to 39 million, close to the record high of 39.28 million non-zero wallets in May, Wang said, citing the data as an indicator of a positive sentiment in the market.  An increase in bitcoin-pegged coins and stablecoins is also a sign of a bull market, Wang said. The analyst noted that 6,022 wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) were printed on Ethereum in the last seven days, and Tether printed 1 billion ERC-20 USDT on Nov. 5.  Data tracked by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis shows renewed accumulation by large investors, i.e., whales. Investors holding at least 1,000 BTC snapped up 142,000 coins in the last week of October, taking the cumulative tally to nearly 200,000 BTC - the highest in 2021.  According to Daniel Kukan, senior cryptocurrency trader at Swiss-based Crypto Finance AG, bitcoin’s latest upside move appears to be spot-driven, as funding rates or cost of holding long positions in the perpetual futures market remains low.  Data provided by Coinglass.com shows the average funding rate was 0.0250% early Monday versus 0.0589% on Nov. 3. Exchanges calculate funding rates every eight hours. A very high funding rate is widely taken to represent excess bullish leverage. A combination of rising costs and sideways price action often forces traders to trim long positions, leading to a price pullback.  Kukan said the sideways action seen in the past couple of weeks was a typical bull market pause. “It was a healthy consolidation and the market has not tested the short term support of $58,000, which is a strong signal,” Kukan added. “I can see some interest to sell at slightly above $70,000, [but I] guess we are going to take out that level rather fast.”  The Japanese exchange bitbank expects bitcoin’s price to be as low as $58,000 and as high as $76,000 this week.  Bitcoin’s previous all time high was on the back of the approval of the first bitcoin futures-backed exchange-traded funds in the U.S.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,"Eliza Gkritsi, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/08/bitcoin-tops-66k-resuming-uptrend-as-real-bond-yields-slide,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8e9bcbe79ee985261945b512b5576d7544e253b4-2476x1382.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
