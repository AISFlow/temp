42420509,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUq8FR,1683588766,"Bitcoin’s ‘BRC-20’ Explosion Sends Users Scrambling for Options, Including Lightning","A lucky miner raked in 6.701 bitcoin (BTC) or almost $200,000 in transaction fees on Sunday night, exceeding Bitcoin’s current block subsidy of 6.25 BTC – an extremely rare occurrence that illustrates how a recent burst of activity on the blockchain related to the Ordinals protocol has led to soaring costs for users.  Late last year, Ordinals introduced “inscriptions,” or arbitrary content like text or images that can be added to sequentially numbered satoshis or “sats” – the smallest units in Bitcoin – to create unique, non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. Ordinals is now also being used to mint BRC-20s, which for all intents and purposes, are fungible tokens.  All these new tokens have quickly exploded in popularity, but at a steep cost. They’ve congested the Bitcoin network and pushed it to its operational limits, offering a real-world test of how the world’s first and largest blockchain might cope with the need to scale rapidly.  Fees to send coins are soaring, transactions are waiting longer in the queue, and some users and exchanges are already starting to consider alternatives. Those include the Lightning Network, a so-called “layer 2” scaling solution designed to make Bitcoin transactions faster and cheaper.  Read more: 'Bitcoin Request for Comment' Tokens Surge to $137M in Market Value  “Can anyone explain how I'm going to onboard people with these fees?” tweeted Anita Posch, Bitcoin educator and founder of Bitcoin for Fairness. “I'm mostly onboarding people in Africa. They don't have the privilege like you to pay these high fees. They really need BTC, while you're just playing around.”  BRC-20s are inscriptions of JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data – snippets of code that port data structures across different platforms. And since the JSON inscriptions are actually code, they can be programmed to mint enormous token supplies – one small block-sized batch at a time – effectively creating fungible tokens via a non-fungible protocol.  That ability to mint stupendous amounts of tokens out of thin air is what’s behind the hysteria – and, for users of the blockchain, angst. Recent blocks have been chock full of BRC-20 transactions, with fees teetering on $20 per transaction, up 800% from the $1-2 per transaction fee that was typical for most of 2022.  That surge in fees sent shockwaves across the Bitcoin ecosystem, causing Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, to temporarily halt bitcoin withdrawals due to fee miscalculation and inducing frustration and distress in certain parts of Africa and Latin America where some residents rely on bitcoin for everyday payments.  Bitcoin’s high fees are having an undeniable impact on users who rely on base layer payments. This is where the Lightning Network comes in. The Lightning Network is a Bitcoin layer 2 scaling solution where a collection of interconnected computers route bitcoin payments off-chain, resulting in cheaper and faster transactions.  Read more: Block Demand Leads to Fee Spike as Bitcoin-Based Meme Coins Flourish  Binance said it’s in the process of integrating Lightning given the sudden spike in bitcoin fees.  But even Lightning requires an initial on-chain transaction in order to establish a payment channel, and Posch says costs are so prohibitive, even that single transaction is now out of reach for many.  “Can't use on-chain, can't open channels,” Posch tweeted. “Makes custodial Lightning the only option. And all that because some people think it's fun to break Bitcoin.”  That last point about breaking Bitcoin has been a recurring theme on Crypto Twitter, following the chain’s NFT mintfest.  While Posch is implying that meme-loving hackers are having fun testing the limits of Bitcoin, others have adopted a more conspiratorial interpretation, suggesting without evidence that the BRC-20 phenomenon is actually a coordinated attack on the world’s dominant blockchain.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | BNB,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/08/bitcoins-brc-20-explosion-sends-users-scrambling-for-options-including-lightning,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dc1770b949281a62a66f4c0c060a05142a60b2d6-7053x5806.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin miners make money in two main ways: spawning new BTC by crunching numbers, and processing transactions on the network. Over time, the first has – by design – become less profitable; every so often, the reward gets cut in half. That payment stands at 6.25 BTC currently, and will go down again next year.  So, that creates a potential, existential threat to the profitability of mining over the long haul: eventually, the mining reward could become quite small, and will ultimately go away (likely more than 100 years from now) once all BTC have been mined.  The big recent jump in profits from processing transactions, therefore, could be a welcomed development, especially given the intense pain – including multiple bankruptcies – that has struck the mining industry during this crypto winter. The trend has picked up so much steam that on several occasions on Monday, mining pools such as Luxor Technologies and AntPool got paid higher transaction fees from newly added blocks than the 6.25 BTC mining reward.  Ordinals appear to at least partly explain the shift. This new project inscribes non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Bitcoin’s blockchain.  Read more: 'Bitcoin Request for Comment' Tokens Surge to $137M in Market Value  Their emergence over the past few months is a “cool example of how, just when you think Bitcoin has become boring, there’s something waiting around the corner that surprises everyone,” said Colin Harper, head of content for mining pool Luxor Technologies who did not expect transaction fees to surpass the block reward between now and when the 6.25 BTC subsidy gets halved.  A lot of people, according to Harper, are thinking about whether they can “envision a future where we completely replace the subsidy with the transaction fees, and many people thought that was impossible before something like this.”  Harper added: “Some doubted whether or not Bitcoin blockspace can have use cases outside of settling value,” but now “there are new uses for blockspace and any use of blockspace where people are paying fees is good for Bitcoin in the long-term.” The question for Harper is whether or not inscriptions and Ordinals have staying power.

Technical analysis shows that the Parabolic SAR has flipped bearish on the daily chart, indicating a possible downturn shortly. Bitcoin’s price has also dropped below the 50 exponential moving average (EMA), a critical support level. The Parabolic SAR is a popular technical indicator to identify potential trend reversals in the market. When the indicator flips bearish, it suggests that the asset’s price could be heading lower. In this case, the bearish signal on Bitcoin’s daily chart could mean the cryptocurrency is due for a correction. Related Reading: Pro-XRP Lawyer Weighs In On The Ongoing Lawsuit Ruling Brace For Bitcoin Correction As Support Levels Falter According to the trader and technical analyst Ali, If Bitcoin fails to sustain a close above the 50EMA level, it could confirm a potential correction to $26,200 or even $25,000. Furthermore, Bitcoin’s failure to hold the 50EMA as support is another warning sign for traders. The 50EMA is a widely watched moving average that shows the average price of an asset over the past 50 days. When an asset’s price falls below this level, it can be seen as a bearish signal, indicating that the asset may be headed lower. Currently, Bitcoin is down by over 4% in the last 24 hours, trading below the 50EMA; this could confirm a potential correction to $26,200 or even $25,000, according to the analyst. These levels represent significant support zones for Bitcoin; the cryptocurrency could see a further downside if they fail to hold. Furthermore, according to Ali, The Bitcoin network is showing signs of contraction, with declining user adoption and a series of lower highs and lower lows. This decreasing trend of wallet activity could signal a drop in Bitcoin’s price shortly. As BTC adoption declines, the demand for the cryptocurrency also decreases. This ultimately puts downward pressure on BTC’s price, as fewer people are interested in buying and holding the cryptocurrency. The trend of lower highs and lower lows seen in the Bitcoin network suggests that the cryptocurrency’s price may be headed for a correction. Added to this, more bad news for Bitcoin bulls mounts; Bitcoin’s largest whale address, owned by Binance, has been highly active in the market, moving $2.26 billion worth of Bitcoin in just four transactions, according to Santiment data. This sudden movement has caused Bitcoin’s supply on exchanges to drop from 6.78% to 5.84%, indicating that the whale may transfer Bitcoin to a cold storage or custody solution. BTC Above $25500, Signals Long-Term Bullish Trend Despite recent market fluctuations, BTC is still showing a strong upward trend, according to the analysis of the weekly BTCUSD chart by The Birb Nest, a cryptocurrency and investment platform. Furthermore, BTC is trading above the rising 200-week trend and the flattening 50-week trend, which is a positive indicator. The Birb Nest has pointed out that the upward trend will likely continue if Bitcoin remains above the $25,500 level. However, the crypto analysis firms keep a potential visit down to the $25,000 level. This level is seen as a key support level for Bitcoin, and a sustained hold above it could signal a bullish outlook for the cryptocurrency. Moreover, The Birb Nest has noted that there has been a weakened relationship between Bitcoin and the S&P 500 prices in recent weeks. This is reflected in the 7-week correlation coefficient, which stands at 0.39. Although the correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500 has weakened, it remains positive. This suggests that both assets still share some similarities in terms of price movements. Therefore, if there are gains or losses in large-cap stocks, Bitcoin will likely be somewhat affected.

42420498,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUq8AH,1683581905,U.S. Crypto Exchange Bittrex Files for Bankruptcy in Delaware,"Crypto exchange Bittrex has filed for bankruptcy in the U.S. state of Delaware on Monday, months after announcing it would wind down operations in the country and weeks after being sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  The exchange believes it has more than 100,000 creditors, with estimated liabilities and assets both within the $500 million to $1 billion range, according to a court filing shared by Randall Reese of Chapter 11 Dockets, a bankruptcy tracker.  Bittrex's U.S. branch has had a rough 2023 so far, laying off 80 people in February and announcing in March that it would end all operations by the end of April. These changes have not affected Bittrex Global, the non-U.S. crypto exchange.  Despite Bittrex's impending exit from the U.S., the SEC sued it in mid-April on allegations it operated a national securities exchange, broker and clearing agency. The SEC also sued former Bittrex CEO Bill Shihara and Bittrex Global. Bittrex Global CEO Oliver Linch said last month that the exchange intended to fight these charges in court, but a bankruptcy proceeding may make this more difficult.  Bittrex is the latest crypto entity to file for bankruptcy, joining fellow exchange FTX and a host of lenders like Celsius, Voyager and BlockFi.  In filings made at the Delaware Court, Evan Hengel, the company's Co-Chief Restructuring Officer of Bittrex, said that customers would get a ""100 percent like-kind cryptocurrency distribution"" under its liquidation plan, enabling them to access the Bittrex platform and withdraw their crypto.  The company ""faced an untenable regulatory and economic environment"" given ""the lack of regulatory clarity in the U.S. [which] created a substantial negative economic impact on the digital asset industry and resulted in overlapping regulatory burdens and soaring regulatory costs,"" Hengel said.  Richie Lai, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of the company, tweeted that the bankruptcy filing was the ""cleanest way to bury the baby,"" but that Bittrex ""still have 100% of all customer funds.""

The changes theoretically should benefit holders of the CANTO tokens, since the proposed changes would result in a lower inflation rate of the overall supply.  If passed, the mining incentives for each liquidity pool on Canto such as ETH/CANTO and ATOM/CANTO will be reduced on average by roughly 38%, according to a blog post. The governance proposals would also reduce Canto’s inflation rate, or the number of CANTO tokens emitted per block to 4.76 CANTO, representing a 15% decrease.  Canto community members passed a vote in February to reduce security emissions and liquidity mining incentives. At that point, contributors wrote that the project had already succeeded in attracting “deep liquidity in the Canto DEX and Canto Lending Market,” and they were now “looking to optimize the long-term sustainability of Canto’s incentives program.”  The recent governance proposals, set to go live on May 11, represent another step to slow down block rewards or “security emissions” as well as liquidity mining rewards across the board.  “In order to maintain the security of the Canto network, the total max supply of $CANTO inflates over time at a rate that is constantly decreasing,” according to Canto docs.  Security emissions are block rewards given to stakers for securing the network, while liquidity mining incentives are awarded to users who provide liquidity for various crypto pools on Canto.

To avoid this, popular on-chain analyst LookOnChain has sorted out prominent whales to keep an eye on and ease the task of catching the next PEPE. According to the analyst, these whales were very early to notable meme coins such as Shiba Inu (SHIB). LookOnChain noted these whales are “smartMoneys that both bought SHIB and PEPE early and made millions of USD.” Discovering The Next Memecoin That Could Run 100x In a series of threads, LookOnChain unveiled three SmartMoney wallet addresses that invested early before the bull run. Whales are large cryptocurrency investors believed to understand the market well and make early and efficient investment decisions. They are mostly known to take long-term positions in projects they believe in. Other investors closely follow their actions to capitalize on their investment strategies. Related Reading: Study: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Is More Of A Successful Memecoin Than PEPE and DOGE According to data from Etherscan, the first address highlighted by LookOnChain is one of the earliest SHIB buyers. It purchased 1.31 trillion tokens for $13.5K in February 2021, when the SHIB traded at $0.00000001. This individual later sold the tokens for $5.81 million during the bull run, earning a profit of over $5.8 million. Interestingly, this same address started investing in PEPE as early as April 17, well before the asset became hype among investors, buying a total of 396.7 billion PEPE with $9,815. After selling 116.8 billion tokens from its PEPE holdings for $392K, the address now holds 280 billion PEPE, with $1.18 million in realized and unrealized profits. Another address, which began investing in SHIB as early as April 2021, made a profit of $3.84 million on their investment. This same address started purchasing PEPE on April 19, buying 558.5 billion PEPE with $286K. The current unrealized profit on the token investment held by this address is $1.34 million. LookOnChain also mentioned an address associated with the domain “cryptopolitan.eth” that purchased SHIB in February 2021 at the same time as the first address, making a profit of $2.45 million on the investment. This same address began purchasing PEPE on April 19, buying 340 billion PEPE with $103,000. As of this writing, cryptopolitan has secured a profit of $695,000 from the frog meme token investment. Related Reading: PEPE Whale Transfers 4.23 Trillion Coins To Binance – Will Price Tank? PEPE: Ran Out Of Gas Meanwhile, the memecoin crashed after making significant waves in the crypto industry over the past week. The memecoin is now beginning to see a price decline, indicating traders are profiting or getting bored of the memecoin. The token’s rally initially started late last month. This was when the memecoin pumped from a low of $0.00000002 on April 27 to as high as $0.0000042 on May 5. This growth drew the attention of many traders and investors, who saw it as an opportunity to profit from meme-inspired crypto. The price of the token began to decline soon after reaching that peak. As of May 8, the token price had fallen to $0.000000211, representing a decline of 51% from its all-time high.

Meanwhile the CoinDesk Bitcoin Trend Indicator (BTI) is showing that the asset is in the middle of a significant uptrend.  Long-term holders’ 30-day change in bitcoin supply has been trending higher since March 31. Long-term supply is defined as coins that investors have been holding for 155 days or more.  As these investors are often less likely to spend older coins, an increase in the metric reflects dormant supply, as well as bullish sentiment.  The uptick is occurring as bitcoin prices have flattened over the identical period, implying that bitcoin holders view the recent pause in price movement as an opportunity to acquire more. Year-to-date, bitcoin prices are up 68%.  The increase also occurs as bitcoin’s Network Value to Transaction (NVT) value of 57 is 6% higher than its year-to-date average of 53.7. The NVT ratio is calculated by dividing BTC’s market capitalization by its transferred, on-chain volume.  Comparable to the price-to-earnings ratio in equities, higher NVT levels indicate that bitcoin is overbought, while lower values indicate that it may be oversold. In this case, the close proximity to its average implies a market trading at a slight premium, but relatively in balance at the moment.  Meanwhile, CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Trend Indicator is implying that price may move higher.  The tool, which was developed by CoinDesk Indices, produces a daily signal indicating the direction and strength of bitcoin’s price trend.  Using a series of moving average crossover windows, the tool broadcasts one of five daily values ranging from “significant downtrend” to “significant uptrend.” BTI indicates that bitcoin is in the middle of a significant uptrend.  Traders with a short-time horizon will likely note that BTI flashed the uptrend signal on April 28, following a decline into neutral territory. BTC prices are down 5% since that specific signal.  A year-to-date time horizon will show that the first uptrend signal of 2023 occurred on Jan. 13, with BTC prices increasing 40% since that date.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/08/long-term-bitcoin-holders-add-to-their-holdings-even-as-prices-retrace,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a699ec638f6ce271027308cc6dcd83f6e40ad8f4-3774x5661.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at around $27,350, down over 5.5% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data, as investors continued to mull over a surge in interest in the PEPE meme coin and Binance congestion issues that forced the exchange giant to temporarily suspend bitcoin withdrawals over the weekend.  Binance resumed the service Sunday night (ET), but the stoppages and rising price of bitcoin raised questions about the impact of large bitcoin transaction volume.  Ether (ETH) followed a similar pattern, falling beneath the $1,900 level it’s held for much of the past seven days. The second largest crypto in market value was trading at around $1,829, off 4.4% on a 24-hour basis.  ETH’s deflationary narrative post-Ethereum Shapella upgrade has strengthened as ETH’s net issuance, or the annualized inflation rate, recently dropped to -2.7%, according to ultrasound.money. More than 62,300 ETH, worth around $116 million, have been burned over the past seven days, ultrasound.money’s data tracker showed.  “Both BTC and ETH haven't tested near-term supports since the rally we saw around mid-March,"" Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, told CoinDesk in an email.  DiPasquale said BTC might test support between $25,000 and $27,000 before bouncing again, although the economic outlook is favorable for BTC and the broader crypto market to thrive. He called accumulating BTC and ETH on dips a “sound strategy.”  Most major tokens were also trading in the red on Monday, including crypto payment-focused XRP and Polygon’s MATIC, which both tanked over 8% to trade at around 42 cents and 92 cents, respectively. The PEPE craze appeared to be waning with its market cap dropping to some $878 million after peaking above $1 billion before the weekend, Messari data showed.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which measures the overall crypto market performance, was down over 5% for the day.  Greg Cipolaro, global head of research at bitcoin investment firm NYDIG, wrote in a Friday newsletter that despite short-term price fluctuation, BTC is increasingly serving as a “buy-and-hold asset” based on on-chain data.  “With more bitcoins being held for longer, a dwindling supply is available for short-term trading,” Cipolaro wrote, adding that this may result in increased volatility or trading costs through wider spreads.  “Given bitcoin’s fixed supply nature, this also means that fewer bitcoins are available for others to purchase. This may result in upward pressure on prices if the demand for bitcoin grows,” he wrote.

Bit4You said it was suspending activities in April, citing the collapse in Estonia of its service provider CoinLoan which held many of its funds – but revelations made today by Belgium’s Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA) suggest there may be more to the story.  “FSMA had previously notified Bit4You of its intention to refuse its request for registration” even before the crypto exchange asked to have its provisional registration withdrawn on May 2, the regulator said in a statement.  FSMA had “informed the public prosecutor of irregularities noted in regard to the former management” while assessing the company’s application under money-laundering rules, the statement said, adding that the company had been “forced to modify all its governance structures” as a result of the regulator’s findings.  Belgium’s crypto registration regime took effect in May 2022, but existing companies such as Bit4You were able to keep a provisional license while their fuller application was considered.  In an April 26 blog post, Bit4You said it was suspending activities due to the CoinLoan insolvency, and subsequently itself filed for administration in a Belgian court.  The Belgian public prosecutor's office told CoinDesk that it had ""opened a file on Bit4You following the accusation by FSMA,"" adding that ""an investigation is ongoing.""

Morgan responded to a Twitter user, Marc Fagel, who’s been debating the XRP lawsuit with John Deaton. Morgan noted that Judge Torres was clear regarding her line of judgment on the Ripple case. Notably, the main issue in the case is whether or not Ripple sold XRP as a security. Related Reading: How Long Will Dogecoin Remain Sideways As Sellers Threaten Bearish Breakout? Bill Morgan on Judge Torres In Bill Morgan’s opinion, Judge Torres will base her judgment on facts regardless of the SEC’s broad and undefined position. Also, Ripple argues that it did not require registration since it didn’t sell XRP as an investment contract. Judge Torres made it very clear in the Daubert motion decision that the issue she must decide is whether Ripple sold XRP as a security despite the SEC taking broader positions at times in this litigation that seemed to suggest any sale of XRP was an investment contract or /1 https://t.co/HL1mclv8Xg pic.twitter.com/BrcHGAQlG9 — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) May 8, 2023 However, the SEC took a broader stand that all XRP sales are securities, relying on the first allegation that Ripple distributed XRP through statutory underwriters. Morgan is unsure how Judge Torres will decide the case and why the SEC overstretches its positions towards XRP sales in the secondary market. Morgan noted that the SEC argues that Ripple’s XRP continuous offering in the secondary market violates securities law, stretching toward ODL customers who are not investors. In addition, he said that all XRP sales occur in the secondary market since Ripple has only offered XRP to ODL partners since 2020. Related Reading: Bitcoin Block 788695: The Day Transaction Fees Took The Crown He also responded to the founder of Crypto Capital, Justin Bons’ comment that Ripple’s defense hinges on XRP decentralization. According to Morgan, Ripple’s defense does not hinge on the XRP ledger’s decentralization but on the Howey test application. However, the court is yet to decide the factual relevance of decentralization based on the Howey test. Congress Should Prohibit Regulators From Working At Firms They Regulated Recall that John Deaton called out the SEC on May 5 for its broad and undefined position on the XRP lawsuit. Deaton further noted the SEC couldn’t tag XRP as security since the sales do not meet the prongs in the Howey Test. The attorney weighed in again today, noting specific things that should change in the SEC. The US-based lawyer said Congress should pass a law prohibiting regulators from leaving to work at a firm they previously regulated for at least three years.

However, another Bitcoin enthusiast has discounted the rumor that Bitcoin was the subject of an attack, saying that the increased usage due to the BRC-20 meme coins was the reason for the congestion. The discrepancy caused congestions that led Binance to move BTC into cold wallets, halting withdrawals while the issues get resolved. It’s still uncertain how this issue will affect Bitcoin, but its price is 3.29% down in the last 24 hours.

The Fed’s tightening monetary cycle might be close to the end. As the US dollar continues to weaken due to accelerated de-dollarization and multi-polarization, Bitcoin may continue to gain momentum in the global financial market. Amid the revolt against the US dollar, Bitcoin may return to above $32,000 thanks to catalysts including a slowdown in inflation, mitigation of energy issues, and a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine. Investment Thesis The US dollar faces challenges of de-dollarization, debt crisis, potential economic recession, and the rise of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC-USD). Against this backdrop, Bitcoin’s popularity has grown. After finishing the first quarter on a strong note, it is entering a consolidation phase and will have the chance to get back above $32000. Technical Analysis: Entering Consolidation, the Next Major Resistance at $32000 Driven by multiple factors, including tightened monetary policies and the bank crisis, the crypto market performed strongly in Q1 2023, with the total market cap growing by 49% to $1.19 trillion. BTC rose 72% and closed at $28,440, while Ethereum (ETH-USD) rose 53% and closed at $1,827. BTC rebounded after testing the support at $15,000 in Q1. And into a new quarter, BTC is also entering a new journey in terms of weekly and monthly lines. We applied the Donchian Channel (“DC”) indicator to assess the volatility of the market. From the weekly Chart, we can see that the weekly line of BTC still goes below the middle band of $32,000 and it has been slightly fluctuating for over two weeks after the strong rebound. It seems that BTC is still in a post-rebound consolidation phase at the weekly level. Meanwhile, the Average True Range (ATR) indicator has emerged from a long-term downtrend but is still at a low point in the cycle, indicating that the market is still in consolidation. Therefore, by combining the two indicators, we believe if the weekly line breaks meaningfully above the middle band, while the ATR indicator also reverses and breaks through, then it means that BTC will enter a strong upward phase, and it is advisable to enter the market at an appropriate time. Bing Ventures The monthly line of BTC has just experienced three consecutive bullish candles, but it has yet to reclaim the loss from last June when BTC started at $35,000. Combined with the centerline of the DC indicator in the weekly chart, we believe $32,000 might be the next major resistance level. Applying the DC indicator, we can see the monthly line of BTC is still under the middle band but is high above the lower band. Meanwhile, the ATR indicator continues to be in a long-term downtrend. This means an immediate reverse might not be in sight. Indicators such as increased outflows from stablecoins and capital outflows from exchanges also confirm that the rebound is not sustainable. Bing Ventures Macro Environment: Fed’s Tightening Cycle Close to End, Multipolar Reserve System Be the Trend The US non-farm payroll data for April released on May 5 was better than expected and showed the labor market to be resilient. Meanwhile, the Consumer Price Index ((CPI)) report released on April 12 showed inflation slowed again. Although the market’s concerns over the vulnerability of the US Dollar Index increased, considering that economic activity is at a reasonable level and inflationary pressures subsided, we believe the Fed’s tightening monetary cycle might be close to the end. Bureau of Labor Statistics Previously, the Fed’s aggressive tightening policy has resulted in huge capital inflows, leading to a global US dollar crunch. While the USD dollar crunch intensified, it did not lead to liquidity risks. And in the first quarter of 2023, global capital flows into dollar-denominated assets have slowed . Therefore, we believe the US Dollar Index might drop to the lowest level within the year in the coming weeks and remain sideways afterward. Most importantly, the Russia-Ukraine war has made it clear to people in the US dollar system that US dollar reserves can be frozen by the US. The gradual uncoupling from the US dollar and multi-polarization will be the trend in the global financial market. One potential outcome of this trend is for Bitcoin to solidify its position in the global financial landscape. And the performance of US stocks and US treasuries confirmed favorable macro conditions that are conducive to this trend. US stocks’ performance in the first quarter was in line with expectations with both fundamentals and technical indicators in bullish mode. Firstly, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE)’ s below expectation year-on-year increase of 5.1% in February indicated mitigated inflationary pressure, which boded well for the stock market. Secondly, the US economy remained strong and corporate profits continued to grow, providing support for the rebound of US stocks. Thirdly, the employment rate looked good. And in the policy front, the Federal Reserve’s change of attitude also contributed to reducing downward pressures on the market. Bloomberg In Q1, the S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq all performed strongly with the Nasdaq leading the increase due to the outperformance of tech stocks. Meta and Tesla shares both increased by over 60%. On the contrary, bank shares underperformed badly. Both the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index and the KBW Nasdaq Regional Banking Index suffered declines. It should be acknowledged that the overall rise of the S&P 500 has covered the sluggishness of the whole market and big tech stocks have become safe harbors for investors. We believe the US economy is at a crossroads in choosing between continued growth in the stock market and an economic recession and one of the largest risks the market will face in the upcoming months will be the US economy falling into stagnation. S&P Dow Jones Indices The ongoing Q1 earnings season and key economic data releases should have a great influence on the performance of the market, especially the data on cooperate profits and economic growth. The Fed turning more dovish will be conducive to a recovery of the market. Performance of the US stocks in Q2 is unpredictable due to the continued existence of some uncertainties from last year, especially the impact of rate hikes on the US economy. Although S&P 500 has been in sideway movements lately, daily volatility is increasing, making it difficult to assess the true healthiness of the market. As S&P 500 companies successively release their Q1 earnings, we believe the EPS predictions will be reduced. Also, we think the trend of narrowing profit margins might continue till the end of the year before restoring growth. The US 10-year Treasury yield often stays in long-term downtrends, but every time it rises to the upper edge of a downtrend channel, a global financial crisis occurs. This time, the speed and degree of its upward breakthrough were unprecedented in 40 years. At present, the yield curve of US Treasuries is rapidly turning positive, which could be a harbinger of a US economic recession. The UK and the Euro-zone were major buyers of US Treasuries, while Japan and Korea pulled money out of the market “unwillingly” and China continued to cut holdings. We believe, in the second quarter, international capital inflows into the US will further slow down and foreign purchases may even register net decreases. Alpha Value Research & Analysis Influenced by the recent banking crisis, investors’ expectations for the US 10-year Treasury yield for the next three months should move downward, but the mainstream opinions will still be for it to fluctuate within 3.4%~3.6%. Barclays According to the Treasury International Capital report , at least 16 countries sold US Treasuries in January this year, including China, Belgium, Luxembourg, Ireland, Brazil, France, Saudi Arabia, Germany, Mexico, Israel, Kuwait, Colombia, Sweden, the Bahamas, Vietnam, and Peru. This trend reflects the growing recognition of the adverse effects of the debt-based economic model of the US and seemingly indicates that the monetary authorities of various countries are increasingly aware of the unreliability of the US debt being a core asset backing the US dollar. Conclusion: BTC is on the way back to above $32,000 We believe as some countries’ fiat currencies collapse due to debt crisis, BTC will demonstrate its power to challenge the incumbent debt-based financial system. As long as the debt size keeps increasing, BTC will command an increasingly larger proportion as a source of capital in the debt recycling pool. In the second half of 2023, we predict that BTC will rise to above $32,000 thanks to catalysts including a slowdown in inflation, mitigation of energy issues, a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war, and the reverse of the M2 supply trend. Bloomberg, TheMarketMemo The above factors will collectively drive the beginning of a new bull cycle. Consumers will gradually see Bitcoin as a store of value and a hedge against M2 inflation instead of a direct hedge against CPI inflation. Particularly in the middle regions of emerging markets that are fraught with frictions from multi-polarization, BTC will become one of the perfect natural alternatives for US dollar dominance. Meanwhile, if the US economy falls into a recession in one of our expectations, the Fed will probably halt rate hikes and there will continue to be an oversupply of money and deficits in government budgets. As competitors of the US dollar system have less power and discretion than the controller of the US dollar system, the possibility of their fiat currencies being weaponized by a few authoritarian politicians is fundamentally eliminated. In this context, Bitcoin’s narrative as a fully stateless currency makes it a more reasonable choice. It can be imagined that the large-scale adoption of Bitcoin could significantly lower the possibility of conflicts among political interest groups. In summary, we are at a critical turning point in the economic cycle, and while the Fed focuses all its attention on managing economic growth and inflation, it will face even greater challenges when unpredictable crises occur in the economy. In that situation, if there is no particularly negative news for cryptocurrencies, BTC will be able to return to above $32,000.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4601572-bitcoin-may-get-back-above-32000-in-the-rebellion-against-the-us-dollar?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/12454541.jpeg

Looking at the specific stocks, American Airlines ( NASDAQ: AAL ) and Fortinet ( NASDAQ: FTNT ) shares jumped on an analyst upgrade, while Six Flags Entertainment ( NYSE: SIX ) shares increased in response to stronger than expected Q1 earnings. Meanwhile, PacWest Bancorp ( NASDAQ: PACW ) led the rally among regional banks after slashing the dividend to build capital. Among decliners included crypto stocks, mainly pulled down by decline in bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) prices amid Binance ( BNB-USD ) concerns. Occidental Petroleum ( NYSE: OXY ) shares fell after Warren Buffett stated that Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK.A ) did not want to take complete control of the oil company. Gainers Six Flags Entertainment ( SIX ) shares jumped more than 21% after topping consensus mark in Q1 . The CEO stated: ""Looking ahead, our team is excited to launch numerous special events this summer, including Viva La Fiesta, Flavors of the World, Six Flags Fireworks Spectacular, and parades. These events, combined with exciting new rides and attractions and our focused investments in infrastructure, should help us deliver an enhanced guest experience this year."" American Airlines Group ( AAL ) shares rose nearly 4% after J.P. Morgan upgraded the stock to Overweight from Neutral. Analyst Jamie Baker said they breathed a bit more revenue life into the 2024 and raised EPS estimate to $3.00 from $2.50. Fortinet ( FTNT ) shares rose roughly 3% after Bank of America analyst Tal Liani upgraded the company to Buy from Neutral on the basis of good fundamentals following strong first-quarter performance . The price target has been lifted from $66 to $75.00 per share. Analysts believe the stock's premium price to its cyber peers is justified, given the company's excellent fundamentals. PacWest Bancorp ( PACW ) shares rose around 2% at midday after surging more than 36% in premarket hours after the company cut its dividend to $0.01 from prior $0.25 to build capital. Paul Taylor, the company's CEO and president, described the dividend reduction as ""a prudent step to accelerate our plans to build capital to CET1 of 10%+."" He also added that PacWest's business ""remains fundamentally sound."" Decliners Shares of Occidental Petroleum ( OXY ) fell almost 2% after Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett stated that Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK.A ) ( BRK.B ) did not want to gain complete control of the firm.

42420525,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqAiD,1683566670,PEPE Meme Coin Craze Spreads Wealth to Ethereum Validators Running Blockchain,"This past weekend’s craze around the meme coin PEPE drove a dramatic increase in the profitability for validators running the Ethereum network – at the heart of the action.  Ethereum validators, who are responsible for running the blockchain following its transition last year to a proof-of-stake network, saw profits from MEV-Boost payments spike over the weekend, according to the dashboard mevboost.pics. The total revenue including transaction fees nearly matched what validators made during the trading frenzy that accompanied the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX crypto exchange.  On May 6, the total reward in MEV revenue was at 549.05 ETH and 2,457.73 ETH in gas fees, for a total of 3,006.78 ETH (worth $5.6 million at current prices). On Nov. 9, at the height of the FTX collapse, MEV revenue was at 2,505.69 ETH while gas fees were at 1,423.99 ETH, for a total revenue of 3,929.68 ETH ($6.1 million).  ​​MEV, or maximal extractable value, is a feature of crypto trading, with some parallels to arbitrage in traditional markets. It represents the amount of additional income that validators can earn by rearranging or optimizing the order of transactions within a block, an ostensibly legal activity that’s sometimes likened to front-running.  The main tool that Ethereum validators use to overcome some controversial MEV practices is MEV-Boost, a software created by Flashbots, that allows validators to request blocks from a network of builders. Validators connect to MEV-Boost through relays to earn MEV.  As part of their MEV rewards, validators are allotted a share from the transaction fees from the block they propose as well as the MEV within a block.  When the meme coin craze began with PEPE, transaction fees skyrocketed and validators made a significant amount of money thanks to those fees.  Normally, during these kinds of periods, the MEV itself constitutes a very large part of the income that validators make, however, when gas fees spike, validators can make more money off of that too.  Since 85% of Ethereum validators are connected to MEV-Boost, most of the data reflecting MEV activity is captured through that.  “In the end, block proposers (validators) make a lot of money if people pay high fees for their transactions,” said Toni Wahrstätter, an Ethereum researcher who tracks MEV-Boost activity with his dashboard.  The only time that MEV rewards and gas fees were both higher than the PEPE craze was during the SVB bank run and depeg of stablecoin USDC.  Since the weekend, transaction fee rewards have declined, following the pattern of PEPE’s drop in price and Binance listing it on the centralized exchange.

The price of LINK has crumbled as the bears take down the bulls, leaving investors wondering what the future holds for the asset. There was a significant 24.55% decrease within the past weeks in the Chainlink (LINK) market. Notably, on April 18, 2023, LINK dropped from $8.795 to a low of $6.635, changing the trend to favor the bears. Chainlink (LINK) In A Consistent Bearish Trend LINK is trading in the red today, May 8, 2023. As of the time of writing, the price is $6.66, representing a decline of 3.31%. Also, its 7 days price gains have declined, sitting at a loss of 3.44%. LINK price kickstarted a downtrend from April 19, when it lost grip on the $8 price mark to $7. It fell below $7 to $6.91 and $6.99 on May 1 and 2 before reclaiming the $7 price. However, it continued declining till the current price of $6.94 today.

One of the key factors contributing to the bearish sentiment around LINK is the general market trend. The cryptocurrency market has been highly volatile over the last two weeks, with many assets, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, experiencing significant price drops. However, it is still uncertain whether the bulls will retake power and drive the price of LINK upward or if the bears will continue to rule the market. LINK Technical Analysis The Chainlink trading chart for May 8, 2023, shows its market trend is bearish, and LINK shows negative momentum. Currently, the asset is trading below its 200-Day and 50-Day Simple Moving Averages (SMA). This indicates a bearish trend in the market. This also shows that both long-term and short-term trends are bearish. LINK price is lower than its average price over the past 50 days and 200 days, respectively, and the market’s selling pressure is high. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 38.68; this shows that LINK is currently low selling pressure. An RSI below 50 indicates that the bears control the market. Lastly, the MACD line is trading below the signal line, indicating that the sellers have more control than the buyers. The MACD histogram also confirms the bearish sentiment as it is below the zero line. The momentum will continue if the bulls cannot maintain the selling pressure.

42420529,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqAlJ,1683565895,Private-Equity Giant Apollo Is Part of a Bid to Buy Bankrupt Crypto Firm Celsius,"Apollo Global Management, the distressed-investing specialist that oversees more than half a trillion dollars of assets, is participating in a bid to acquire stricken cryptocurrency lender Celsius, according to a person familiar with the matter.  Celsius has publicly identified several entities who are trying to purchase the company. The person said Apollo is an investor in the bid submitted by NovaWulf.  Apollo, which is one of the largest private-equity firms in the world, declined to comment, as did NovaWulf.  The crypto industry was pummeled last year by falling prices and scandals that triggered a slew of high-profile bankruptcies. Potential buyers for those assets did emerge – though not all efforts were successful – but giants from traditional finance generally stayed away. So, Apollo’s participation in Celsius is a rare case.  The revamped Celsius will mine bitcoin (BTC), participate in ether (ETH) staking and issue blockchain-based security tokens representing ownership interests in itself. A winner of the Celsius auction has not yet been announced; the sale process was recently paused with no new date revealed.  Investors in the NovaWulf bid – if it’s picked as the winner – will receive a tiered management fee plus an incentive fee tied to the restructured Celsius’ net asset value (NAV), according to an investor deck seen by CoinDesk. Apollo’s name and the terms of its deal with NovaWulf were not mentioned in the document.  NovaWulf has partnered with the Provenance Blockchain to facilitate the issuance and trading of equity tokens in the new Celsius. Provenance’s sister fintech company, Figure, will help provide infrastructure for the tokenized securities. Apollo is already working with Figure on tokenized assets.  Provenance, which uses the Cosmos blockchain as its underlying ledger, boasts over $7 billion in total locked value (TVL), the largest trove of on-chain assets outside of Ethereum, according to Provenance Blockchain CEO Morgan McKenney. Meanwhile, Figure qualifies as a broker-dealer and has an alternative trading system (ATS) exemption to trade natively issued blockchain securities, she added.  UPDATE (May 8, 2023, 22:38 UTC): Adds that Apollo declined to comment.

42420513,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqAUn,1683564314,Fractional Reserve Banking Is a Fraud (but It's Genius),"The recent buyout of First Republic, the second-largest bank failure in the U.S. ever, has raised serious questions about solvency and liquidity across the global banking system. Banks are supposed to be stodgy operations: Customers deposit money into a bank account for safekeeping and withdraw it whenever they want to use it. And by and large that system works.  But banks need to make money, and most banks in the United States are basically free or low-fee accounts. So how do banks make money? By lending out customer deposits to risky businesses to make yield, of course.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.     In reality, banks run like this: Short-term, safe customer deposits come in the door, the bank uses those short-term customer deposits to invest in long-term, risky assets in exchange for future financial returns and then the banks pray like hell that all the customers don’t want their deposits at the same time since short-term deposits are tied up in long-term assets.  This is fractional reserve banking (where only a fraction of customer deposits need to be held in the bank’s reserve) and it’s a widely-known fraud. And while this fraud is indeed a fraud, it has in a way been beneficial to society even though we would be more well-served to have a way to opt out of the fraud.  A blog post by Steve Randy Waldman’s Interfluidity on the topic of the complexity of finance puts it best:  “Financial systems help us overcome a collective action problem. In a world of investment projects whose costs and risks are perfectly transparent, most individuals would be frightened ... A banking system is a superposition of fraud and genius that interposes itself between investors and entrepreneurs.”  What does this mean?  Basically if banks weren’t able to invest short-term, low-risk customer deposits into long-term, high-risk assets then the availability of investment capital for most of the crazy, world-changing ideas entrepreneurs come up with would have never been funded. Banks help us spread the risk of financial capital allocation.  Fraud and genius  In absence of banks participating in this genius we could instead have a financial system where the only financial capital that invests in long-term risky investments is the capital that commits to investing in long-term risky investments (see: narrow banking).  Therein lies the fraud. The fraud is that almost no one who deposits money into bank accounts knows that they are opting into this particular solution for the “collective action problem” of financial capital allocation.  Here’s the thing though, this genius has been kind of good for society. We’ve been tricked into making productive investments. Unproductive investments too, sure. But you’d be hard pressed to argue that we would have made more productive investments without the genius of fractional reserve banking.  But when fractional reserve banking is backed by the U.S. government when no alternatives available or even legally allowed, like with Custodia Bank or The Narrow Bank, that is a problem. People should have the option to deposit with these narrow banks that don’t participate in fractional reserve banking practices because, as we’ve seen recently, when fractional reserve banking goes wrong the fallout is catastrophic.  See also: BNP Paribas Will Link Digital Yuan to Bank Accounts for Promoting CBDC Use: Report  The good thing is that banks do appear to be moving towards a more narrow model. Sure, it might get more expensive for companies to get capital since there will be less capital available if the fractional reserve banking system becomes less popular, but that’s fine.

12453134,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=530498,1683563434,PEPE Token Futures Cast Gloom For Investors As Prices Plummet By 45%,"Pepecoin (PEPE) tokens were issued in mid-April and quickly gained popularity among investors, reaching a market capitalization of $1.8 billion in just over three weeks. However, the meme coin’s journey took a downward turn as the token dropped nearly 45% from their peak on Friday, causing a ripple of concern among investors. Some speculate that the sudden price drop was due to traders taking profits on their positions, while others point to the introduction of Pepe-tracked futures as a possible cause. Either way, the Pepe token’s once-promising journey has hit a snag, leaving investors wondering whether this amphibian-inspired cryptocurrency can regain its footing and hop back into the limelight. Related Reading: Shiba Inu: Whales Accumulate Yet Price Drops – What’s Going On? PEPE Token’s Value Down After Short-Lived Rally As of writing, the PEPEUSD token’s price on CoinGecko stands at a mere $0.00000233, having fallen 10.6% in the past 24 hours. This comes as a disappointment to investors who had witnessed a remarkable seven-day rally, during which the token’s value had surged by a staggering 221.0%. The sudden downturn in the PEPEUSD’s value is a reminder of the volatility that characterizes the world of cryptocurrency. Despite the promising rally of the past week, the token’s current price suggests that caution is still warranted for those considering investing in this meme-inspired digital currency. Crypto total market cap weakens to $1.12 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com Related Reading: How Long Will Dogecoin Remain Sideways As Sellers Threaten Bearish Breakout? Following an unprecedented surge in value that saw PEPEUSD rise by almost 5,000,000% in just a few weeks, holders of the altcoin may be capitalizing on their gains by selling off their positions. This is reflected in the significant decline in the token’s value, which previously reached a peak of $0.00000431. Pepecoin had quickly taken the crypto market by storm, and in just over three weeks since its issuance in mid-April, it had achieved a market capitalization of $1.8 billion. However, the sudden drop in value indicates that the token’s meteoric rise may have been too good to last, and investors may be re-evaluating their positions accordingly. PEPEUSD Profits Converted To Ether As Deposits Hit New High Following the massive surge in Pepecoin’s value, investors are reportedly taking profits by converting their holdings into Ether (ETH), which recently hit an all-time high in deposits to exchanges since November 2021 when it reached a high of $4,500. 🚀 Updating our report on #Ethereum‘s sky-high active deposits, exchange addresses interacting on the network is now at its highest level since November, 2021.

The Pepecoin rally has seen some investors turn small investments into significant profits within just a few days after the coin’s issuance. However, with the recent drop in the token’s value and the high volatility of cryptocurrency in general, investors should proceed with caution and conduct thorough research before investing in any digital currency.

""The way Canadians pay for everything from the daily necessities to major purchases is evolving rapidly,"" the bank said in a statement. ""As the world becomes increasingly digital, the Bank — like many other central banks — is exploring a digital version of Canada's national currency."" The central bank further said that a digital Canadian dollar is not yet needed and any decision to proceed with one rests with Parliament and the Government of Canada. That's similar to the U.S. Federal Reserve's stance that it wouldn't issue a U.S. central bank digital currency unless Congress approved its issuance. The Bank of Canada is seeking opinions on such topics as: How people would likely use a digital Canadian dollar; What security features are important; and Concerns about accessibility and privacy. “We want to hear from Canadians about what they value most in the design of a digital dollar. This will help us make design choices and ensure that it is secure, reliable and meets the needs of Canadians,” Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Rogers said. In the event that the BoC does issue a CBDC, it would continue to provide bank notes as well, it said. ""Cash isn't going anywhere."" The public consultation runs until June 19. The Bank of Canada will publish a report summarizing the public consultation later this year. Early in 2022, the U.S. Federal Reserve issued a discussion paper on issuing a CBDC, but didn't stake any specific stance. Later in the year, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank would require backing from Congress to proceed with creating a CBDC.

12451982,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=530459,1683559816,Stacks (STX) Surges 10% Due To Bitcoin Network Congestion,"While the Bitcoin and crypto markets are deep in the red, one altcoin stands out today, posting a double-digit price increase: Stacks (STX). Along with the Lightning Network, the project is considered the most promising layer-2 technology for Bitcoin at the moment and is currently benefiting from the network congestion dilemma. There are currently over 425,000 unconfirmed transactions in the meme pool. Before being added to the Bitcoin blockchain, transactions are sent to the network’s meme pool, where they wait to be selected by a Bitcoin miner and inserted into the next Bitcoin block. At medium priority, a transaction currently costs an average of $19.04. The Case For Stacks The congestion is causing a heated debate: While one side calls it a DDoS attack on Bitcoin, the opposing side is calling the reason for the high fees, Bitcoin ordinals and BRC 20 tokens, a revolution. But no matter which side one takes, one thing becomes obvious. Layer-2 technologies are absolutely necessary and could emerge as a big winner. Revolution or DDoS? 🚀Market cap of BRC20 based #Bitcoin tokens reaches $1 billion. ⌛️Sh*tcoins are extremely congesting the network. There are still 425,000 unprocessed transactions piled up in the meme pool. — Jake Simmons (@realJakeSimmons) May 8, 2023 However, if the BTC price alone is to be the leading indicator, the current dilemma surrounding BRC20 tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain is not really doing the network any good. Binance hasn’t really done the market any favors either with the multiple withdrawal halts. Related Reading: Stacks (STX) Stumbles As Bulls Fail To Remain Intact But in the long run, higher fees are needed for the BTC network to replace the falling block reward. Co-inventor of Stacks, Muneeb Ali, therefore wrote today on Twitter that high fees are not an attack on Bitcoin, as they will be the norm when Bitcoin grows to a billion people. Rather, Ali says they are a wake-up call to developers to improve and grow Bitcoin L2s. Bitcoin fees just hit a new record. Up 500x from just a few months ago. Officially marks the start of the arms race to build the best Bitcoin L2s. Lightning, Stacks, and Rootstock have a head start. Time to build. Bitcoin expert Will Clemente also made the case for L2 today: If we are in a new regime of higher Bitcoin tx fees due to ordinals/brc-20s, think there’s a very compelling setup for the lightning network over the next few years. STX Rises 10% During the first days of May, the Stacks price has broken a downtrend that has lasted since March 20 (black line). Thanks to today’s 10% rise, the STX price now faces the 23.6% Fibonacci level at $0.82. At the price level, stronger resistance from the bears can be expected. Since April 19, STX has not managed to regain the mark. Related Reading: Stacks (STX) Price Defies Bears, Surges While The Market Bleeds If this succeeds, a rally to the region of $0.92, where the 38.2% Fibonacci is located, seems possible. Afterwards, the way to the psychologically important mark of $1 would be clear (50% Fibonacci). If the bulls also break through this level, $1.07 (61.8% Fibonacci) and $1.18 (78.6% Fibonacci) would be the next targets.

In 2020, the SEC accused Ripple and two of its executives -- CEO Bradley Garlinghouse and co-founder Christian Larsen -- for violating the country's securities laws by selling XRP ( XRP-USD ) through a digital asset securities offering without first registering the token as a security. Ripple has made plain that XRP ( XRP-USD ), which Ripple uses to power its offerings, should be considered a digital currency instead of a security. The company, in turn, has been disputing the SEC's claim. “You have video footage of the chair of the SEC, as a professor at MIT, saying 75% of these digital assets are commodities,” Garlinghouse told CNBC . “And now he says they’re all securities because he’s the head of the SEC and he’s seeking power and he’s putting power ahead of sound policy to grow an economy in the United States.” More on Ripple and XRP Blockchain firm Ripple sells $361M worth of XRP coins during Q1 Ripple February Update: ODL Data, Buyback Theory, LBC Price Surge, SEC Final Arguments",NEUTRAL,XRP,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | ICO | REGULATION | XRP,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/news/3967132-ripple-ceo-says-200m-will-have-been-used-to-fight-sec-report?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/12451916.jpeg

12451419,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=530457,1683558075,Shiba Inu Price Crash Persists Despite Trillions Of SHIB Tokens Being Bought Up,"Shiba Inu [SHIB] is facing a significant price drop despite trillions of the meme coins being purchased. However, this amount of purchase can’t seem to stop its price crash. What could be causing this downward trend, and will it continue in the coming months? Despite the large number of Shiba Inu tokens purchased, the cryptocurrency market remains highly speculative, and prices can be affected by a multitude of factors. Could it be that investors are losing faith in Shiba Inu’s long-term potential, or is this simply a temporary setback in a highly volatile market? As the Shiba Inu price continues to decline, many investors are left wondering whether they should hold on or cut their losses. Shiba Inu Token Volume Surges But Price Continues To Decline A recent report from cryptocurrency intelligence agency, IntoTheBlock, indicates that large buyers purchased over 10.25 trillion SHIB tokens in the past week, exceeding sales by 250 billion SHIB. Despite this volume surge, the price of SHIB has continued its downward trend for the third week in a row. Interestingly, the week saw a spike in bullish sentiment, as large buyers seemed to dominate the market. However, this paradoxically did not translate to a rise in the token’s value. Although SHIB demonstrated growth from Monday to Wednesday, this trend was short-lived, and the token’s value fell during the next three days. This trend is in line with the recent bearish trend of the cryptocurrency market, which has been characterized by significant volatility and price declines. Shiba Inu’s value on CoinGecko currently stands at a mere $0.00000899, having undergone a 4.2% slump in the past 24 hours and an 10.6% decline over the past seven days, leaving investors in a state of uncertainty about its future trajectory. Source: Coingecko Cryptocurrency Market Volatility And The Future Of SHIB The decline in SHIB’s price is not an isolated case but is instead reflective of the cryptocurrency market’s recent volatility. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, have also undergone significant price corrections in the past week, which has created uncertainty in the market. The fluctuation in prices can be attributed to several factors, including regulatory pressures, investor sentiment, and even environmental concerns around the energy consumption of mining cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Shiba Inu: Whales Accumulate Yet Price Drops – What’s Going On? SHIB total market cap at $5.3 billion on the daily chart at TradingView.com Related Reading: How Long Will Dogecoin Remain Sideways As Sellers Threaten Bearish Breakout? The recent slump in SHIB’s price can, therefore, be understood as part of a broader trend in the cryptocurrency market, which has been characterized by significant price declines and uncertainty. Moreover, with the growing popularity of alternative meme tokens like PEPE, investors may be exploring other options instead of SHIB, which could further contribute to the decline in SHIB’s price. However, it is important to note that the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile and unpredictable, and it remains to be seen whether SHIB will recover from its recent slump or not. Investors need to exercise caution and undertake thorough research before making any investment decisions in the volatile cryptocurrency market.

While Coinbase ( COIN ) has been plagued with increased regulatory scrutiny in the country, the company ""is not going to relocate overseas,” Armstrong told CNBC, adding “we’re always going to have a U.S. presence ... But the U.S. is a little bit behind right now” in terms of crypto regulation. COIN, meantime, sank 6% in Monday morning trading, as bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and other major tokens faced downward pressure amid fellow crypto exchange Binance's withdrawal issues . The bulk of Armstrong's remarks focused on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which sent a warning to Coinbase ( COIN ) in March that the regulator recommended enforcement action against the company for allegedly selling unregistered securities to investors. COIN is disputing the Wells Notice, having sued the SEC toward the end of April. SEC Chair Gary Gensler is not ""necessarily trying to regulate the industry as much as maybe curtail it,"" Armstrong contended, as quoted by CNBC. ""But he’s created some lawsuits, and I think it’s quite unhelpful for the industry in the U.S. writ large, but it also is an opportunity for Coinbase to go get that clarity from the courts that we feel will really benefit the crypto industry and also the U.S. more broadly.” All in, COIN is looking to boost its overseas investments, Armstrong said , citing interest in the crypto-friendly United Arab Emirates. Note, the company last week debuted an offshore crypto derivatives exchange in Bermuda , a move that Needham predicted could rake in up to $200M a year.

12450987,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=530432,1683556802,Bitcoin To Drop Further? Whales Show Signs Of Dumping,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin exchange whale ratio has spiked recently, something that could lead to further downside in the asset’s value. Bitcoin Exchange Whale Ratio Has Sharply Surged Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the exchange whale ratio is currently at its highest level since September 2019. The “exchange whale ratio” is an indicator that measures the ratio between the sum of the top 10 inflows to exchanges and the total exchange inflows. An “exchange inflow” is any movement of Bitcoin towards the wallets of centralized exchanges from addresses outside such platforms (like self-custodial wallets). The top 10 inflows here refer to the 10 largest inflow transactions going towards these platforms. Generally, these largest transfers are coming from the whales, so the exchange whale ratio can tell us how the inflow activity of the whales currently compares with that of the entire market (the total inflows). When this indicator has a high value, it means these humongous holders are making up a large part of the total inflows currently. As one of the main reasons why investors move their coins to exchanges is for selling-related purposes, this kind of trend can be a sign that whales are selling right now. On the other hand, low values of the metric imply this cohort isn’t making too many inflows relative to the rest of the market. Such a trend can be either neutral or bullish for the cryptocurrency’s price, depending on some other market conditions. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin exchange whale ratio over the last few years: Looks like the value of the metric has been pretty high in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin exchange whale ratio has observed a pretty large spike recently. This suggests that whales are making up a rather large part of the total exchange inflows currently. Related Reading: Bitcoin Block 788695: The Day Transaction Fees Took The Crown The metric has crossed the value of 0.8 in this spike, implying that more than 80% of the inflows are coming from these humongous investors right now. This level of ratio hasn’t been seen in the market since way back in 2019. This previous spike of similar scale occurred as the price was winding down from the April 2019 rally, and shortly after it took place, Bitcoin registered an extension in its drawdown. An even larger spike in the ratio was also observed earlier in the same year, around when the aforementioned April 2019 rally topped out. The timings of these two spikes may suggest that it was the dumping from the whales that influenced the market and caused the price to go down. Related Reading: If Over 2,300 Banks In America Are Bankrupt, Will Bitcoin Break Above $40,000? If these previous instances of whale inflow activity of similar levels are anything to go by, then the Bitcoin price may face a bearish decline in the near term due to the current potential selling pressure from this cohort. The drawdown may have possibly also already started, as the cryptocurrency’s price has taken a dive below the $28,000 mark today.

Early in the session, Bitcoin fell 5.8% to the $27,800 level and Ethereum dropped 6.9% to a mark near $1,850. As a result, funds that offer exposure to blockchain technologies, digital mining companies and digital asset exchanges have dipped into the red.

At press time, its trading volume is down by over 15%, with a price decrease of 2.80% in the last 24 hours. Such a decline comes after major crypto assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum took a blow and entered bearish territory. After its decline from $101.85 to $90.44 on April 19, 2023, the bears mounted more pressure pushing its price down to $81.11. What Next For Litecoin? LTC is in a downtrend today, forming a bearish engulfing pattern on the daily charts as it descends to lower lows. It has dropped below its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and is trading below its 200-day SMA, with bearish sentiment in the short and long term. Related Reading: Shiba Inu: Whales Accumulate Yet Price Drops – What’s Going On? Also, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 34.74 and rapidly descending to the oversold region of 30. It implies that the bears are in control as more traders take short positions in the market. And the decreased trading activity is aiding the current price drop. LTC’s Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is below its signal line and displays a negative value. This is a bearish sentiment for the asset. LTC Support And Resistance Levels LTC has dropped below $83.30, leading to speculations of further price decline. The bears at the $88.26 resistance level have resisted a potential break to the upside for the asset. Other critical resistance levels are $90.99, approximately the psychological resistance of $100, and $100.20. Related Reading: Cardano TVL Climbs By 10% In A Day – Is ADA Set To Soar Once Again? LTC will likely rest on the $80.87 support in the coming days and might decline further to the next support of $78.85. The indicators are all bearish and point to a decline. However, LTC can rally again if the $80.87 support becomes a price pivot for an uptrend. Litecoin Halving Boost Hope For A Future Rally In 2023 Litecoin is a cryptocurrency from the original Bitcoin protocol. Litecoin halving is similar to that of Bitcoin which is an event where miners’ rewards are reduced significantly as a price control measure to increase scarcity and boost its value. 100 Days till the Litecoin Halving! — Litecoin (@litecoin) April 24, 2023 Since its creation, LTC has held two halving events in 2015 and 2019. The block rewards were reduced from 50 LTC to 25 LTC in 2015 and 25 LTC to 12.5 LTC in 2019. The next halving is 86 days away and will decrease the miner’s rewards per block from 12.5 to 6.25 LTC. The projected halving date is August 3, 2023. Litecoin daily mining rewards stand at 7,200 LTC daily, equivalent to $588,600. Also, its hash rate is 625.39 TH/s which is still profitable for miners. The halving event occurs every four years, similar to Bitcoin’s, and might trigger a price increase, although this is not guaranteed.

42420511,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqAVp,1683554323,Privacy Project Railgun DAO Adopts Chainway’s ‘Proof of Innocence’ Tool,"Railgun DAO, a blockchain project that uses zero-knowledge cryptography to provide extra privacy to users when making transactions, said it has teamed with the Turkish developer Chainway to add a “proof of innocence” feature to satisfy anti-money-laundering and sanctions compliance.  Chainway released its “proof of innocence” tool in January, allowing blockchain users to prove that withdrawals from the coin mixer Tornado Cash are not from a list of specified deposits. The U.S. Treasury Department blacklisted Tornado Cash last August, arguing that the platform had been used to launder more than $7 billion.  The new functionality on Railgun allows users “to create a proof that their transactions are from a list of transactions that have not interacted with any blacklisted addresses, without revealing their identity,” according to a statement from a Railgun contributor. The Railgun privacy system is deployed on Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum and Binance Smart Chain.

Around 200 licenses were withdrawn by the firms themselves, and around the same number was rejected by the country's Financial Intelligence Unit, which has been charged with implementing a 2022 law that requires companies to keep hefty capital reserves and genuine links to Estonia.  “In renewing authorizations, we saw situations that would surprise every supervisor,” Matis Mäeker, director of the Financial Intelligence Unit, said in a statement, adding that “suspicious circumstances” on applications sometimes suggested links to unlawful activities.  Applications showed individuals appointed to management boards without their knowledge, or using falsified credentials. Documentation was often identical between different companies because many of them had used the same cluster of legal and professional service firms, the FIU said.  “Soon, we can return to normality in terms of supervision, where we will be moving largely from assessment on paper to daily on-site supervision,” added Mäeker, who previously told CoinDesk that the law requires “hippie-like” crypto projects to professionalize.  Home to digital unicorns like Wise, Bolt and Skype, Estonia has also sought to repair its reputation after a scandal involving the laundering of Russian funds through the Tallinn branch of Danske Bank. As a member of the European Union, the country will also soon have to implement the bloc’s Markets in Crypto Assets regulation, which requires wallet providers and exchanges to gain a license.  A recent evaluation of Estonia’s anti-money laundering efforts by international standard-setters Moneyval “is tremendous work for the entire country as well as the FIU,” Maeker told a March 29 conference. “Hopefully, it also closes the book on our banking sector and our banking sector scandals – I think it will, it did.”  Read more: In Estonia, the Party’s Over for 'Hippie' Crypto Firms",NEGATIVE,없음,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/05/08/estonias-registered-crypto-firms-drop-80-as-tough-new-checks-reveal-suspicious-behavior,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/84723eb13b121d1f30647a4aea24e260f72df4c4-4000x2661.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The project has been progressing slowly, but today will launch a new tool designed for the “AI Age.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Block 788695: The Day Transaction Fees Took The Crown Per a press release shared with Bitcoinist, the team behind World Coin launched a new crypto wallet called World App, a financial and identity manager. Previously in a testing phase running on Polygon, the crypto wallet is now open to the public and free to download. ChatGPT, Not The Only Tool That Will Change The World? With a simplified interface, the wallet will natively support the World Coin and Ethereum ecosystems. The app has been designed to remove the friction from onboarding new users to crypto. In that sense, the app was created to fulfill three core objectives: provide people with a decentralized alternative to manage their data and identity, access finance, and increase crypto adoption. According to the release, World App was “intentionally designed” to protect people’s privacy. The crypto wallet will provide users with access to rewards for learning about crypto and even World Coin Grants to help the project evolve into a toolkit to “empower individuals in the Age of AI, built on top of the largest network of real humans.” The World App is available in over 80 countries. During its beta phase, the World App onboarded over 1.5 million users with 500,000 active monthly users and 60,000 transactions. Tiago Sada, Head of Product at Tools for Humanity, told Bitcoinist the following regarding their newest product: The intentionally simple design of World App aims to accelerate adoption of decentralized financial and identity systems. World App manages to abstract away a lot of complexity while preserving critical properties like self-custody and privacy. It is uniquely enabled by World ID’s Proof of Personhood to offer features such as gasless transactions, learn to earn courses, and 24/7 chat support to increase accessibility. Beyond A Crypto Wallet, What Is World App? The World App will be compatible with World ID, another application that operates as a “human passport to access” the internet. The app provides a seamless connection with the online world, allowing users to verify their identity, sign into websites, and access decentralized applications. In addition, World App can be connected to the legacy financial system. The app has several deposit and withdrawal options for bank accounts and local payment methods. People can send and receive money instantly for free. Per the release, the app is aiming at becoming much more than a crypto wallet: World App wallets use account abstraction through SAFE contracts to increase security and simplicity. Peer-to-peer payments support ENS usernames for friendlier ERC-20 transfers. Token trading is made possible by the Uniswap protocol. Circle’s USDC enables users around the world to hold digital stablecoins backed by real dollars in a compliant manner.

42420526,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqAg9,1683550800,"Sam Altman’s Crypto Project, Worldcoin, Releases First Major Consumer Product","In the age of large language models (LLMs) and ChatGPT, AI is poised to make a weird internet even weirder – turning the content-driven social media apps, news sites and media platforms of today into future uncanny valleys that blur the line between man and machine.  As advances in AI make it more difficult to discern bots from humans, Sam Altman, the co-founder of Open AI – the company behind ChatGPT – thinks blockchains can help.  Altman’s crypto project, Worldcoin, rose to prominence last year with a controversial, Silicon Valley vision for a universal basic income (UBI): a crypto token that can be distributed in equal quantity to everyone in the world.  Worldcoin is back again this week with a new launch – this one poised to be its biggest yet. World App, Worldcoin’s crypto wallet, built on the Ethereum sidechain Polygon, is the first product from the elusive identity upstart that anyone, anywhere will be able to download.  The new app is one part minimalist crypto wallet, and one part passport for the AI era. It’s Worldcoin’s biggest swing yet to redefine itself in the eyes of consumers.  (Re)introducing Worldcoin  Worldcoin’s initial rollout was rocky. The retina-scanning metal “orb” that the project used to authenticate new users was criticized as dystopian, and a damning exposé from the MIT Technology Review forced Tools for Humanity – the company behind Worldcoin – to confront allegations of exploitation and deceptive recruiting practices.  Weathered by negative press coverage and a tumultuous year for the wider crypto industry – and amid an AI boom kicked off, in large part, by Altman’s Open AI – Worldcoin reasserted itself in March with a repackaged vision focused on “proof of personhood.” Announced in March, Worldcoin’s World ID protocol will allow app developers to leverage its network of biometrically-authenticated humans.  “Everything that has happened with AI in the last six months has made people understand the project a lot better,” said Tiago Sada, the head of product at Tools for Humanity.  World App  For those without a World ID, who’ve yet to peer into one of Worldcoin’s retina-scanning orbs, World App will function as a stripped-down crypto wallet – not too dissimilar from Coinbase Wallet, Metamask, or any number of other apps that allow people to buy, sell, and store cryptocurrency.  “You would probably find even fewer features on World App, actually, than on some of those wallets – and that's deliberate,” explained Sada.  Tools for Humanity has global ambitions, and it says it designed its wallet app to be more accessible than other wallet services. To avoid overwhelming new crypto users, the app opts for a sleek, “minimalist” design, boasts a relatively bare-bones feature set, and is somewhat restricted in the number of crypto tokens that it supports.  Built on Polygon – a blockchain that can send and receive assets from Ethereum but offers cheaper fees to users – World App currently offers access to “wrapped,” Polygon-based versions of Bitcoin, Ethereum and stablecoins like the U.S. dollar-pegged DAI token (Worldcoin says more tokens are coming soon).  “I think this really meets that need of keeping all of the really important guarantees of privacy and self custody of crypto, but in a way that's just super friendly – as friendly as custodial services” that store crypto on a customer’s behalf, explained Sada.  All of the aforementioned features will be available to anyone who downloads World App. For those in possession of a verified World ID, World App will serve as a kind of digital passport – granting retina-scanned humans access to apps and services gated to World ID holders.  There aren’t many applications that leverage Wolrdcoin’s identity protocol yet, but if you squint, you might be able to imagine the future envisioned by Sada – where World ID is weaved into the very fabric of blockchain and the broader web.  As for where World ID could be useful one day, “a big pocket is financial services,” says Sada. “For example, there are things like undercollateralized lending in DeFi that really haven’t been possible because there is no sense of identity.”  Sada is also excited about applications around voting and social media account authentication. “Whether you're talking about voting on a poll on something really dumb on Twitter, or voting for something much more serious, there's a lot of really interesting voting applications there,” he said.  World App will provide a gateway for World ID users to claim their allotment of Worldcoins, though the token remains unavailable to claim in the United States for regulatory reasons and the mechanics of the claim process elsewhere remain somewhat vague. “We are generally not able to talk a lot about the Worldcoin token right now,” Sada said.  Although the perks of having a World ID remain mostly theoretical in May, 2023, Tools for Humanity is offering World ID early adopters at least one benefit: World ID holders will be allowed to transact on World App without fees.  A Beta version of the World App has already been available to World ID holders for several months. “Since its initial debut, 1.5 million people have joined the beta, more than 500,000 of which use it every month,” Tools for Humanity said in a statement. “On a typical day, it sees around 60,000 transactions and 25,000 World ID checks from over 100,000 people around the world.” According to Tools for Humanity, its new wallet app is “already one of the most popular ways to access crypto today.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MATIC | WLD,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/08/sam-altmans-crypto-project-worldcoin-releases-first-major-consumer-product,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ed6bedcab36b13363509a434bc645099fd33eb0e-1641x923.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The withdrawal issues weighed on the broader crypto market, with bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) sliding 3.9% to $27.87K as of shortly before 8:45 a.m. ET, and ethereum ( ETH-USD ) dipping 2.7% to $1.86K. The crypto behemoth noted that higher fees have been applied to pending transactions ""so that they get picked up by mining pools,"" Binance tweeted. Both suspensions -- one on Sunday and the other on Monday morning -- lasted less than 90 minutes. ""To prevent a similar recurrence in the future, our fees have been adjusted. We will continue to monitor on-chain activity and adjust accordingly if needed,"" it said . ""Our team has also been working on enabling BTC Lightning Network withdrawals, which will help in such situations.""

Related Reading: Bitcoin Block 788695: The Day Transaction Fees Took The Crown The firm now plans to include the Bitcoin lightning network for BTC transactions. The only downside is that the alternative comes with a higher fee. But the exchange revealed plans to cushion it. Binance Plans To Enable BTC Lightning Network Withdrawals According to a recent report, the exchange is working toward enabling Bitcoin lightning network withdrawals. This move will help clear all backlogs on BTC transactions over the past few days. Notably, Binance suspended Bitcoin transactions twice within the past 24 hours. On May 7, the exchange halted BTC transactions, stating that network congestion was the reason for its action. It later reported the resumption of the transactions. Later the firm announced the temporary suspension of Bitcoin transactions again today, May 8. According to its statement, there’s a high backlog of pending BTC transactions. So, it plans to clear up the backlog by introducing the Bitcoin lightning network withdrawals with higher transaction fees. There is a large volume of withdrawal transactions from Binance still pending as our set fees did not anticipate the recent surge in $BTC network gas fees. Our team is working to accelerate the confirmation of all pending transactions. We'll provide updates here. — Binance (@binance) May 8, 2023 Increasing Demands In The Bitcoin Network The growing hype around the BRC-20 tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain surged demands on the network. Galaxy Research said BRC-20 tokens contributed 50% of the total Bitcoin transactions on May 2. Subsequently, BTC fees hit a new multi-year high. Binance explained that there’d been an increase in the BTC network gas fees recently. However, its fee didn’t account for such a surge. Hence, the exchange would readjust its operational charges to include the sudden fee surge. Further, the exchange stated that it would monitor on-chain activity to initiate timely adjustments once needed. The team is already making moves to enable BTC Lightning Network withdrawals for the present situation. Related Reading: If Over 2,300 Banks In America Are Bankrupt, Will Bitcoin Break Above $40,000?

These coins are based on popular memes or internet culture, and they have gained a massive following in recent months. Few have been as popular as Pepe, the popular frog king of the memes.

Furthermore, 52.9% of the token supply is in the pre-sale to provide liquidity, and 32.9% is provided in liquidity to the DEX. Additionally, 6.9% of the supply is held in a multi-sig wallet for future centralized exchange listings, bridges, liquidity pools, etc. Related Reading: PEPE Market Cap Crosses $1 Billion As Gemini Listing Rumors Spread Larry is easily accessible, with 4.2% of the supply being airdropped to start letting Larry free.

Potential for social media buzz: The Twitter logo has a massive following on social media, and Larry could tap into this potential for virality and popularity. Meme coin trend: Meme coins have become incredibly popular in recent weeks. This could potentially give Larry a boost in popularity among investors who are interested in this emerging market.

Garlinghouse reportedly told onlookers at the Dubai Fintech Summit that he would not advise crypto entrepreneurs to set up in the U.S., adding that the country puts politics ahead of policy.  Ripple, along with several of its executives, was sued by the securities regulator in 2020 over the unregistered sale of XRP tokens worth around $1.3 billion.

Since the collapse of crypto exchange FTX last year, the SEC has cracked down on some of the biggest players in the industry over violations of federal securities laws – although it recently pulled back from officially defining ""digital assets.""  Ripple has historically kept its distance from XRP, which powers some of Ripple’s products.  A judgement on the SEC case is expected in the next three to six weeks, according to the report.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Pepecoin’s (PEPE) rally has run out of steam since Binance, the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, listed the frog-themed cryptocurrency on Friday at 16:00 UTC. The token traded at around $0.0000022 at press time, having set a record high of $0.00000431 about 40 minutes after Binance listed the token, data from charting platform TradingView show. “The volume of news around Pepe peaked with the Binance listing and has since materially declined,” crypto services provider Matrixport’s Markus Thielen said in a note to clients. “The price of the PEPE appears to follow this news cycle and has broken the uptrend.” Per CoinDesk’s Shaurya Malwa, profit taking by early investors likely catalyzed the sharp pullback in PEPE.  Volatility expectations in market leaders bitcoin and ether continue to dwindle despite lingering macroeconomic uncertainty. Crypto exchange Deribit’s ether implied or expected volatility index (ETH DVOL) reached a lifetime low of 51 over the weekend, deepening six-month downtrend. According to crypto asset management firm Blofin’s volatility trader Griffin Ardern, consistent selling of options by structured products has contributed to the implied volatility slide. “Many sellers of these options are exchanges and third-party asset management institutions, and their customers are mainly groups that want to obtain fixed income, such as miners and whale groups,” Ardner told CoinDesk, explaining the unusually low volatility. Per some observers, now is the time to buy volatility, particularly in the ether market.  The Aave community has voted to deploy its version 3 (V3) on the Ethereum layer 2 ecosystem Metis Network. The deployment is likely to bring more liquidity on both platforms and provide liquidity mining incentives to Aave users. Metis will offer 100,000 native METIS tokens as a liquidity mining incentive to Aave users. These tokens will be distributed over a period of six months. AAVE and METIS were down 4.5% and 3.5% at press time.  Chart of the Day  Bitcoin's price has dived out of its recent triangular consolidation to penetrate the widely-tracked 50-day simple moving average (SMA).  Per analysts, the breakdown of the SMA support might yield a deeper sell-off.

Last but not least in this report is TURBO, a meme coin that was created by ChatGPT and ran to over $70 million market cap. It is also the worst performer of the three after declining 44% on the daily chart. A Weekend Of Meme Coin Losses The weekend slowdown has affected all meme coins in the market. Even the top dogs like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have not been left out of the onslaught with 2.8% and 4.5% losses respectively over the last day. As a result of this, the total meme coin market cap fell by 3.5% to $18.18 billion as of Monday morning. Related Reading: PEPE Market Cap Crosses $1 Billion As Gemini Listing Rumors Spread There’s also more red than green on the meme coin lists with the likes of Dogelon Mars, BONK, and AIDOGE all seeing losses. However, it is not just limited to meme coins as the general crypto market has also suffered declines during this time. As a new trading week opens up, it remains to be seen if there will be a reversal in the prices of these cryptocurrencies or if they will continue to bleed.

42420523,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqAhB,1683544898,Block Demand Leads to Fee Spike as Bitcoin-Based Meme Coins Flourish,"Fees on the Bitcoin blockchain have surged to two-year highs as the ‘Bitcoin Request for Comment’ (BRC-20) tokens and the rising popularity of the Ordinals protocol drives demand for block space.  Average transaction fees on the Bitcoin network were hovering at just under $20 during European hours on Monday, a bump from last week’s average $1.20 level. Such levels were previously seen in May 2021, when bitcoin prices set a then-record peak of $60,000.  The number of non-fungible tokens (NFT) tied to the Bitcoin blockchain surged above 3 million last week after a one-day spike in activity that mainly consisted of text-based assets, data from Dune Analytics showed.  The tokens, called inscriptions, function on the Ordinals Protocol. Ordinals allows users to embed data into the Bitcoin blockchain by inscribing references to digital art into small bitcoin (BTC)-based transactions.  Read more: Bitcoin’s Frenzy of Activity Pushes Average Transaction Fee Over $7, Nearly 2-Year High  The BRC-20 token standard allows users to issue transferable tokens directly through the network – which has spurred a collection of digital artwork and meme tokens built on Bitcoin.  Data from OrdSpace, which tracks BRC-20 data, shows over 11,000 tokens issued on Bitcoin are available on the open market as of Monday with a cumulative market capitalization of $1.6 billion.  So far, tokens of Ordinals marketplace Ordi (ORDI) are the most valued BRC-20 tokens with a market capitalization of $220 million and 7,300 unique ordi token holders. Ordi is said to be the first BRC-20 token deployed on Bitcoin, which may also be aiding its value proposition among holders.  Pepe tokens on Bitcoin – different from the ones issued on Ethereum – are the second-largest BRC-20 issuance, albeit with a relatively tinier $17 million market capitalization.  Meanwhile, some analysts consider the rapid transactional activity as a sign of network adoption which adds to Bitcoin’s fundamental narrative.  “During the last peak in 2019, most Bitcoin transactions skewed towards larger transactions, in the range of $1,000 to $10,000,” said Tom Rodgers, Head of Research at ETC Group, in an email to CoinDesk.  “This suggests most Bitcoin users were using the blockchain for trading. Compare this to today. The largest cohort of Bitcoin transactions - 359,560 - came from transactions under $1. This suggests a huge increase in Bitcoin velocity -- or the amount of Bitcoin being transacted by users, instead of being locked up in cold wallets and held over the long term,” Rodgers added.  While adoption has been brisk, the network congestion has briefly caused problems at crypto exchanges such as Binance, which paused bitcoin withdrawals twice over the weekend.  As such, on-chain data shows that there are nearly 415,000 unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions at writing time on Monday, which is higher than anything seen during the bull runs of 2018 and 2021.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/08/block-demand-leads-to-fee-spike-as-bitcoin-based-memecoins-flourish,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6d3a1c512f821c51ebfb500279b1dee9da5c500b-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Although Liechtenstein is not a member of the bloc, it is part of the greater European Economic Area (EEA), to which the framework's relevance can be extended.  Risch, who is also the country's finance minister, did not specify a timeline for adding the payment option, according to the report.

As sellers maintain the upper hand, many are left wondering if the popular cryptocurrency will be able to weather this storm or if a sharp decline is on the horizon. Since late April, DOGE has been experiencing a period of price consolidation. Within this phase, its value has been fluctuating between $0.0763 and $0.0816, and it seems that this sideways pattern could continue if the current market conditions persist. Will sellers push forward and cause a drop in DOGE’s value, or will the buyers step in to turn the tables? Related Reading: Shiba Inu: Whales Accumulate Yet Price Drops – What’s Going On? DOGE’s Price Trends Bearish, With Possible Further Declines Dogecoin’s price on CoinGecko currently stands at $0.07473, indicating a decline of 3.0% over the last 24 hours and a decrease of 6.5% over the past seven days. The dip in value may cause concern among investors, but it also presents an opportunity for those looking to buy low and potentially profit from any future price increases. Dogecoin’s recent price action has been indicating a bearish trend. It has remained below the moving averages, and has formed a bearish flag pattern, which emphasizes the sellers’ leverage in the market. This situation makes a bearish breakout highly possible, especially if Bitcoin falls below $28k, which could push DOGE towards the swing lows of $0.06250 that were last seen in March and January. Moreover, if DOGE drops beyond this support level in Q1 2023, it may reach the bearish target of $0.05828. These figures suggest that the trend is currently negative, and investors should take note of the potential risks associated with investing in DOGE. Outlook For Dogecoin In The Coming Weeks Recent price movements in Dogecoin are consistent with a bearish market phase with further price drops possible in the near future. However, it is essential to note that the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and any sudden positive or negative news could impact DOGE’s value significantly. DOGEUSD still on sluggish mode at 0.0747 on the daily chart at TradingView.com Related Reading: Cardano TVL Climbs By 10% In A Day – Is ADA Set To Soar Once Again? Traders and investors should pay attention to critical support levels, such as the $0.06250 swing lows seen in March and January, as well as the bearish target of $0.05828 based on the flag pole height. If DOGE continues to trend downwards, it is possible that these levels could be tested. On the other hand, if DOGE’s price manages to break through the bearish flag pattern and rise above the moving averages, specifically the 50 EMA and 100 EMA, it could suggest a reversal of the current bearish trend. Traders and investors should keep a close eye on the RSI and OBV, as well as any significant market news that could impact DOGE’s price. -Featured image from SmartAsset.com",NEGATIVE,DOGE,BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/how-long-will-dogecoin-remain-sideways/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

The crypto market saw $2.3 billion in meme coin trading volume last week – a six-fold rise from the preceding week's $387 million to the highest since May 2021, according to blockchain observer James Tolan's Dune analytics-based tracker.  The speculative mania was led by pepecoin (PEPE), a frog-themed token launched in mid-April with a maximum supply of 420 trillion. PEPE crossed $1 billion in market capitalization on Friday, eventually peaking at $1.82 billion, a staggering achievement for a three-week-old meme cryptocurrency. At press time, PEPE's market cap stood at $931 million, per Coingecko.  The PEPE frenzy also spurred speculation in other low-cap tokens like DINO, WSB, CHAD and 4TOKEN, which rose by several hundred percent in the past two weeks.  Historically, speculative mania in non-serious cryptocurrencies has presaged major market tops or bearish reversals in bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value.  Bitcoin traded near $27,970 at press time, representing a 2% drop on the day, despite the weakness in the dollar index (DXY). Bitcoin usually moves in the opposite direction of the dollar index, which gauges the greenback's exchange rate against major currencies, including the euro.  The DXY saw a brief bounce to 101.75 on Friday following the release of surprisingly strong U.S. jobs data, but since then has fallen back to under 101.20.",NEGATIVE,BTC | PEPE,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | PEPE,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/08/meme-coin-trading-volume-surges-to-two-year-highs-signals-caution-for-bitcoin-bulls,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6ff95515432026ecd98f860517a86ea9660b7fd3-1548x873.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

12444911,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=530411,1683537511,Bitcoin Block 788695: The Day Transaction Fees Took The Crown,"Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and trading volume, sets another record with Block 788695 as transactions on its blockchain network spiral out of control. Recently, there has been an alarming rise in user transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, leading to network traffic and congestion. This has increased miner profitability significantly as transaction fees skyrocket to control the situation. In an interesting development witnessed by the crypto community yesterday, miners were seen to have profited highly as transaction fees contained in Block 788695 surpassed the block subsidy. This will be the second occurrence for the Bitcoin network where transaction fees contained in a block are greater than the block subsidy. Related Reading: BRC-20 Token Standard A Hotspot For New Memecoins As PEPE Soars Bitcoin Block 788695 Sets Another Record According to Bitcoin mining data reports from Mempool, transaction fees contained in Block 788695 were seen to be greater than the Block subsidy. The reports show that 6.7 BTC in transaction fees were contained in Block 788695, greater than the 6.25 BTC block subsidy. The last time this occurred was in 2017 when transaction fees contained in Block 500546 were reported to have surpassed the block subsidy. This phenomenon occurs primarily when the Bitcoin blockchain network receives exceedingly high network activity from user transactions. Miners are seen to profit highly from these congested blocks, which contain high user transactions compared to regular blocks. They create blocks by collecting transactions from the Mempool and adding them to a block, and once the blocks are filled, it goes through complex mathematical computations. The miner who solves the math problem is rewarded with transaction fees and the block subsidy. Related Reading: Why Is Bitcoin Down Today? Crypto Market Takes Another Hit The block subsidy refers to the amount of new Bitcoin created or minted in each block. For each block successfully created, the miner is allowed to mint a fixed amount of new Bitcoin, which is based on the ‘current issuance rate decided by the Bitcoin protocol.’ The Bitcoin block subsidy amount is determined by an algorithm in its source code and starts at 50 BTC per block, which is split in half every four years. The split process of the block subsidy, otherwise known as BTC halving, has trickled down to 6.25 from it 50 BTC where it started and is expected to be split further in 2024. Why Are BTC Transaction Fees On The Rise? The jump in BTC transaction fees can be attributed to recent user activities on its blockchain network. For one, the introduction of the BRC-20 token standard on the Bitcoin network for seamlessly minting fungible tokens has gained increased popularity in the blockchain and crypto community. The recent hype of tokens, including meme coins minted using the BRC-20 standard, has led to increased FOMO of users carrying out multiple token purchases and transactions on the Bitcoin network.

Rep. Kim Nam-kuk of the Democratic Party of Korea allegedly withdrew 800,000 WEMIX tokens from late February to early March in 2022, and the transactions were reported to the Financial Services Commission's Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), according to CoinDesk Korea. Kim's WEMIX holdings stood at 6 billion won ($4.5 million) between January and February 2022.  The FIU classified the withdrawals as suspicious transactions and reported them to the prosecutor's office, the report said.  South Korea implemented global standard-setter FATF's travel rule on March 25, 2022, shortly after Kim reportedly made his withdrawals. The travel rule requires exchanges to collect personal data on transactions and report them to authorities when they exceed a certain threshold.  Kim said that he did not cash out his tokens and did not violate any laws, according to the report. There is no reporting requirement for virtual assets in South Korea's Public Service Ethics Act.  WEMIX was delisted from major exchanges in South Korea last year for allegedly reporting inaccurate circulation supply figures. Its issuing company WeMade unsuccessfully challenged the delisting in court.  Kim had co-sponsored an amendment to the Income Tax Act in July 2021, which included a provision to defer taxation on virtual assets, reported CoinDesk Korea.  South Korea postponed plans to tax income from crypto as well as income from the ""transfer or lending"" of virtual assets to 2025.

42420517,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqAZx,1683534676,Crypto Options Exchange Deribit's Ether Volatility Index Hits Record Low,"The downtrend in leading crypto options exchange Deribit's forward-looking ether volatility index (ETH DVOL) continues amid macroeconomic uncertainties and the pepecoin (PEPE) frenzy that has boosted demand for the Ethereum network.  The DVOL index, which calculates ether's annualized 30-day implied volatility or expectations for price turbulence over the next four weeks, fell to a record low of 51 over the weekend, according to digital assets data provider Amberdata. The implied volatility is calculated based on Deribit's options order book.  The index peaked above 150 following FTX's collapse in early November and has been falling ever since. The record low comes nearly four weeks after Ethereum implemented the long-awaited Shanghai upgrade, de-risking the passive investing strategy of staking coins in the Ethereum network in return for rewards.  Bitcoin's DVOL has declined from 74 to 51 of late but remains above the lifetime low of 41.95 in January. Deribit, which accounts for nearly 90% of the global crypto options trading activity, launched the bitcoin and ether DVOL indices in early 2021.  Implied volatility is positively correlated to the demand for options – hedging instruments – and is said to represent the degree of fear or uncertainty in the market.  Currently, there is plenty of uncertainty in the air, courtesy of the U.S. banking crisis and debt ceiling worries. Friday's surprisingly strong U.S. jobs report raised bets that the Federal Reserve's tightening cycle is over. If that's not enough, the U.S. inflation data for April – a market-moving figure – will be released later this week.  ""The world seems full of unknown, unknowns, right now,"" Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said in a weekly newsletter, noting the unusually low ETH and BTC DVOL indices.  In other words, expectations for wild price swings appear underpriced major cryptocurrencies right now.  According to Magadini, volatility expectations in the ether market are more underpriced than in the bitcoin market, and now may be the time to ""go long ETH volatility [buy ETH volatility].""  ""Looking at the ratio of ETH-DVOL divided byBTC-DVOL, relative vol. is basically near an all-time low,"" Magadini noted.  ""A risk-off CRASH would likely hurt ETH spot prices a lot due to its 'Altcoin' nature. But on the flip side, if we're really, truly resuming a crypto bull market, then altcoins should outperform. ETH should out-rally BTC in that ""traditional"" crypto bull scenario,"" Magadini added.  Traders typically buy call or put options or both or volatility futures when intending to profit from an expected surge in volatility.

Up to 31% of the total supply of SHIB is being controlled by 100 whales in the market. However, their accumulation was met by bearishness with SHIB going downward. Source: WhaleStats The token’s recent price movement can be explained by the market’s recent actions. Major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have been doing badly in the past few days.

However, the price seems to stabilize below this level which may be indicative of a bullish breakout. If the bulls manage to break through $0.00000096, investors and traders could then target $0.00001098 comfortably.

The tokens are down nearly 45% after setting a peak of $0.00000431 on Friday, reaching a market capitalization of $1.8 billion just over three weeks since issuance in mid-April.  This price drop was likely exacerbated by traders taking profits on their positions or utilizing advanced trading strategies following the introduction of several pepe-tracked futures in the past week.  These profits are likely being converted into ether (ETH), which hit an all-time high in deposits to exchanges since November 2021, when it set a lifetime high of $4,500 at the time.  As per a Monday tweet, on-chain analytics firm Santiment stated that the increasing number of ether deposits could be stemming from traders taking profits on their pepe positions.  “Exchange addresses interacting on the network is now at its highest level since November, 2021. As expected, $ETH is showing decoupling signs and on the cusp of breaking $2k once again,” Santiment said.  As such, some traders have converted mere pittances into generational fortunes in the span of a few days after investing in pepe coins right after their issuance.  As CoinDesk previously reported, a pseudonymous trader named dimethyltryptamine.eth spent $263 just three weeks ago to buy trillions of PEPE tokens, selling a part of the holdings for over $3.8 million in profits. The trader continues to hold over $5 million worth of the tokens as of Monday.  Such meteoric fortunes aren’t the norm, however: Analysts have repeatedly raised concerns about the behavior of investors who bought relatively large amounts of PEPE after its issuance on the Ethereum blockchain – opening the risk of too much of the coin in too few hands looming over the short-term future of the trending meme coin.",NEUTRAL,ETH | PEPE,ALTCOIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | PEPE,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/08/pepecoin-pepe-drops-nearly-50-from-highs-as-traders-likely-taking-profits-for-ether,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d926ee9442131cd638550762d158c8b43fe1132-2684x1510.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

12442481,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=530409,1683529246,Why Is Bitcoin Down Today? Crypto Market Takes Another Hit,"The Bitcoin price lost 4.2% over the past weekend and slid again to $28,000. The broader crypto market is also consistently in the red. The second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum, is down 6% since Friday. Why Are Bitcoin And Crypto Down Today? As always, Bitcoin’s recent price movement should be viewed from multiple angles, as for most of the time there is not just one reason. However, one factor stands out at the moment: the congestion of the Bitcoin network and the extremely high fees for a BTC transaction. The reasons for the congestion are the Bitcoin Ordinals and the new BRC-20 token standard. With its creation in early March, people can now create fungible tokens in addition to Bitcoin. Embraced by the meme coin community, this new token standard has quickly seen a surge in daily transactions and a market cap of over $160 million this week. Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, first announced on Sunday that it had halted Bitcoin (BTC) withdrawals. According to a statement on Twitter, the exchange has stopped Bitcoin (BTC) withdrawals due to congestion on the Bitcoin network. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Reap Profits As Mining Difficulty Hits 3-Month Low A few hours ago, Binance halted Bitcoin withdrawals again, citing a large backlog of pending withdrawals. Binance tweeted on May 8 that it had “temporarily” shut down BTC withdrawals because there was “a large volume of pending transactions.” We've temporarily closed #BTC withdrawals due to the large volume of pending transactions. Our team is currently working on a fix and will reopen $BTC withdrawals as soon as possible. Rest assured, funds are SAFU. — Binance (@binance) May 8, 2023 After two hours, Binance wrote that BTC withdrawals were available again, but at higher fees. “To prevent a similar recurrence in the future, our fees have been adjusted,” the exchange explained, adding, “We will continue to monitor on-chain activity and adjust accordingly if needed. Our team has also been working on enabling BTC Lightning Network withdrawals, which will help in such situations.” The clogging of the Bitcoin network, as well as the withdrawal pause at Binance, may have unsettled the market and caused the price drop. Remarkably, it’s not just Binance. At press time, 429,000 transactions were waiting in the meme pool to be included in a block. Related Reading: If Over 2,300 Banks In America Are Bankrupt, Will Bitcoin Break Above $40,000? On the other hand, it should be noted that the Bitcoin price has been in a consolidation phase for several weeks now after the furious rally at the beginning of the year. With the recent price drop, BTC is stuck in its trading range, but the overall bullish picture for BTC remains unchanged. Last but not least, the Bitcoin and crypto market is currently struggling with historically low liquidity as a result of Operation Choke Point 2.0, as Bitcoinist reported. Due to this, volatility is expected to be higher as even a few large buy and sell orders can move the market more. Delta-based trader @Skew52 explained that during the price slump, it was noticeable that Coinbase led the market with spot sales to the downside. As BTC stabilized at $28,200 at press time, the trader wrote: $BTC Binance Spot. Update: spot buyers around $28K & likely to sell around $28.5K – $28.7K Still decent bid depth here.

Lookonchain believes that the whale could later decide to sell as the price of Pepe Coin tickles to the north in the crypto market.

Subsequently, analysts say this could boost Bitcoin prices in the weeks and months ahead if the government doesn’t proceed carefully. US Banks Burning Through Capital Buffers The US Treasury and Federal Reserve say that the problems are peculiar to just individual banks, but experts are warning that the situation is much worse than the government admits. With the anti-inflationary measures in place, almost half of America’s 4,800 banks are burning through their capital buffers, and there is still more tightening to come from the Fed. Related Reading: Bitcoin Struggles To Break $30,000 Resistance Level: Here’s Why The full effect of monetary tightening by the Fed has yet to hit the economy, and only then would experts know whether the United States financial system will be able to safely deflate the excess leverage induced by extreme monetary stimulus during the pandemic between 2020 to 2021. The White House did not offer a blanket guarantee for all deposits because that would look like social welfare for the rich. Besides, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) reportedly has only $127 billion of assets and may require its own bailout. For that reason, financial institutions are now pressuring the United States Securities and Exchange Commission to crack down on short-selling strategies that profit when bank stocks slide. Lindsey Johnson, CEO of the Consumer Bankers Association, urged policymakers to take a serious look at the financial havoc wreaked by short-sellers. Bank Failures Could Drive Bitcoin Prices The turmoil in the banking industry is a concern for the Biden administration. If thousands of banks in the United States were to fail, it is possible that some investors could turn to Bitcoin as a way to protect their assets. With the Biden administration’s stance on cryptocurrencies, any action that places the banking system in jeopardy could drive Bitcoin prices higher, even above $40,000. The SEC is not currently contemplating any ban on short-selling bank stocks, according to a senior agency official. In 2008, the SEC called time-out on short-selling on nearly 1,000 financial stocks in a bid to restore faith in public markets. However, the New York Fed later found that the ban did little to stem the financial stock market that was flaying out of control. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Reap Profits As Mining Difficulty Hits 3-Month Low Another study discovered that most of the stocks protected by the ban lost the citizens’ confidence, suffering “a severe degradation” in market quality, price impact, and volatility.

42420544,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqD9x,1683505436,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin at $28.6K Remains Unstirred by Binance Temporary Withdrawal Pause,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin and ether fell slightly on Sunday, although there's potential for a market-wide rally and significant price movement, an analyst says. Meme coin mania has been fueling dramatic shifts in market sentiment.  Insights: Challenges from network congestion due to the Ordinals surge are offset by increased mining incentives, network security and available Layer-2 and sidechain solutions.

As the East begins its trading week, bitcoin and ether were both recently down a few fractions of a percentage point. Bitcoin was off 0.34% to $28,787, while Ether fell 0.4% to $1,913.  BitBull Capital CEO Joe DiPasquale points to meme coins as a reason for a pump in market sentiment but fairly flat activity for the crypto majors.  “The market hasn’t moved strongly this week, but the market sentiment has been on a rollercoaster with meme coin mania at peak,” DiPasquale wrote to CoinDesk in a note. “With PEPE and other meme coins posting high five-figure percentage gains, we wouldn’t be surprised if a market-wide rally materializes in the near term.”  DiPasquale notes that bitcoin still hasn’t tested support levels on the downside, and that Bollinger Bands continue to tighten. This means that the gap between the upper and lower bands is narrowing, indicating a decrease in market volatility. This typically suggests that a significant price movement might be on the horizon, as periods of low volatility often precede larger market trends.  “Moving forward, we’d expect a strong bounce off $25K to continue another leg above $30K,” DiPasquale concluded.

On the one hand, some of the largest miners are either working through bankruptcy proceedings, getting bailouts, or are restructuring debt – all of this a hangover from a brutal, bearish 2022. At the same time, many in the bitcoin community are decrying the congested, expensive state of the bitcoin network caused by the surge in the popularity of the NFT-like Ordinal inscriptions. Binance’s temporary pause of bitcoin withdrawals on Sunday was proof that there’s a problem brewing.  For the uninitiated, Ordinal Inscriptions, akin to NFTs, are digital assets inscribed on satoshis (the smallest currency unit of bitcoin) enabled by the Taproot upgrade, allowing for smart contracts and the minting of NFTs directly onto the Bitcoin blockchain.  The scale of ordinals’ growth has been immense (though many of them are just text). Earlier this month, the number of ordinals surpassed three million, and now that number is just over four million.  In the long run, however, cash-strapped miners are going to be a big beneficiary of this newfound interest in the bitcoin blockchain.  According to data compiled by the user dgtl_assets on Dune, ordinal inscriptions are now producing daily fees just north of $2.7 million, with the total fees coming in at around $14 million.  In an April note, Grayscale argued that the surge in fees from ordinals is useful for incentivizing mining and thus, securing the network.  “While some are critical of ordinals, cautioning against bloating the blockchain or harming fungibility, we believe that ordinals represent one of the larger opportunities for Bitcoin adoption, especially as the Bitcoin network has historically been viewed as a rigid blockchain ecosystem,” Grayscale wrote. “The advent of ordinals has led to an increase in total fees paid to miners, which could potentially establish a sustainable baseline level of transaction fees to incentivize miners.”  Grayscale and CoinDesk share the same parent company in Digital Currency Group.  When balancing network security versus a new channel of mining incentives versus the annoyance of congestion, which one wins? Probably the new incentives channel.  Realistically, this could do a lot to help plug holes in miners’ balance sheets. Sure, bailouts could also be a solution, but that would centralize mining around stakeholders like Binance and Galaxy Digital.  And for those complaining, there are plenty of solutions readily available, like Layer-2s or sidechains such as the Lightning Network or Liquid.  Bitcoiners should celebrate ordinals and be glad that the market is signaling they are here to stay.
