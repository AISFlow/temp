42426914,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxSVh,1463782871,Ethereum Startup Offers Grants to Open Blockchain Developers,"Autonomous financing project String Labs has announced a program to award grants to developers working with Ethereum.  As part of the effort to seed open blockchain finance projects – permissioned ledgers need not apply – the California-based company will award an unspecified number of grants, ranging between $2,000 and $10,000.  String Labs CEO Tom Ding described in interview why the project is choosing to only support open blockchains, telling CoinDesk:  ""Private chains can be more about optimizing time and cost for institutions, but most of the time it doesn’t benefit end users. Permissionless innovation benefits from that.""  The grant program is intended to support permissionless projects on the public Ethereum blockchain underneath any number of open-source licenses similar to MIT’s Open Source Initiative.  As opposed to an investment which would typically result in the financier receiving some sort of equity in exchange, grants winners maintain far more autonomy once they receiving funding.  Examples of the kinds of ideas String Labs wants to fund include financial exchange clients, mobile wallets, peer-to-peer distributed app marketplaces, and other innovative financial protocols.  Ethereum grants grow  The move represents the latest effort to fund development of Ethereum projects through grants.  Last April, the Ethereum Foundation announced a similar program called DEVgrants designed to help developers invest a “significant” amount of time building their projects.  Early winners of that grant include security-deposit based public consensus protocol Casper, which won $25k, and “Snappy”, an Ethereum framework being developed by Internet of Things startup Slock.it, best known for writing the code that underlies The DAO distributed autonomous organization.  Founded in mid-2015, String Labs is asking grant applications to provide concepts that are deliverable within a six-to-twelve month period. Proposals must be submitted by 31st June.

42426917,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxSfh,1463780350,Ether Price Surges 50% as The DAO Draws Trading Interest,"While bitcoin has long dominated the digital currency space, ether has been grabbing headlines – and trading volume – this week as global market participants rally around the digital currency.  The price of ether – the digital currency used by the Ethereum platform – surged by upwards of 50% in the seven days through 20th May, according to figures from US-based digital currency exchange Poloniex.  Bitcoin prices, alternatively, fluctuated less than 5% during the aforementioned time frame.  Ether had an opening value of $10 at 12:00 UTC on 13th May, additional Poloniex data reveals. The currency fell to as low as $9.78 at 08:20 UTC on 14th May, and then lingered near $10 for the next few sessions.  On 16th May, the currency began a sharp climb, culminating in it finishing the week at $14.65. Trading volume rose substantially during the week, as 24-hour volume increased from $12.1m at 11:59 pm on 12th May to $58.3m at 11:59 pm on 19th May.  Bitcoin, on the other hand, had a far less dramatic week, opening at $454.82 and spending most of the week fluctuating between $450 and $460, according to the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). It was on 19th May that the digital currency registered notable declines, falling to a weekly low of $435.62.  The week’s lackluster bitcoin price movements came amid very low trading volume, as Bitcoinity data points reveal market participants traded less than 8m BTC during the seven days through 20th May.  DAO interest rising  Many market observers are crediting ether’s recent price increase to the rise of a distributed organization referred to as The DAO, an Ethereum-based entity which allows market participants to provide both startup businesses and projects with funding – in the form of ether – in exchange for voting rights.  “The desire for many to purchase DAO Tokens” has helped create “a huge amount of cross trading in the BTC/ETH trading pair,” Joe Lee, founder of derivatives trading platform Magnr, told CoinDesk.  “The token sale is structured in a way that for a time after the crowdsale has completed, DAO token holders get a freely exercisable option to either burn or swap the newly minted tokens back for ether,” he continued. “This clever structure has incentivised a large number of ETH holders to take part in the crowdsale.”  Chris Burniske, analyst and blockchain products lead at investment management firm ARK Invest, said he believes the The DAO is likely responsible for ether’s recent price rally.  “The ETH/BTC pair has now appreciated 50% since Monday,” he said.  At press time, the organization has collected more than 11m ETH, worth nearly $160m at current prices.  Building support  While ether experienced a sharp rally during the last week, one market expert highlighted that the digital currency may be retracing old steps when compared to bitcoin.  “Ether is doing the same thing bitcoin is, which is building a support level,” Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Currency Fund, told CoinDesk. ""The price seems to have stabilized.""  However, as Enneking went on to articulate, there are lingering question questions about the extent to which ether's rise is a referendum on problems with bitcoin.  “How much of ether’s price is due to its positive aspects and how much can be credited to the failings (or challenges) of bitcoin?” he asked.  While it’s too early to tell, traders are likely to be watching for signs of correlated market movements between Ethereum and bitcoin.  Potential price bubbles  While some have asserted that the visibility surrounding The DAO helped drive this week’s rise in ether prices, others have warned that these gains could be be short-lived.  George Samman, a blockchain advisor and consultant, predicted that the broader markets will expect ether prices to fall once The DAO's creation phase is over.  “Once DAO ends, it will suck up over 12% of all ether,"" he told CoinDesk. “Expect ether to fall right before the DAO ends as people front-run the event.”  Burniske took a different tack, speaking to the price bubbles that could potentially develop in digital currencies.  “The cryptocurrency space is gaining more attention by the day, which can easily lead to tulip-mania and price bubbles,” he said.

42426918,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxSbh,1463766901,Researchers Plan 'Unstoppable' DAO to Help Whales Save Themselves,"In an attempt to better understand the technical, legal and sociological impact of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) a group of researchers is planning to launch a DAO that would seek to ""save the whales"".  Far from an elaborate trolling, the early-stage effort is backed by big universities and researchers seeking to develop a new understanding of how leaderless organizations, powered by a collection of global stakeholders and enabled blockchain technology, could have a real-world impact on wildlife.  To date, the effort is being led by researchers at the University of Toronto Faculty of Information and the University of California, Irvine, and will use funds from a National Science Foundation (NSF) grant awarded to the UC Irvine team to fund investigations on the legal implications of advancements in blockchain technology.  In interview, University of Toronto PHD student Quinn DuPonthttp://current.ischool.utoronto.ca/students/quinn-dupont acknowledged that while the idea ""started as a joke"", it could raise awareness of, and potentially provide funding to, sea creatures in need.  DuPont explained that the idea would find the researchers actually coding and launching a DAO that would ""autonomously care"" for a pod of Orca whales in the Pacific Northwest. As these gentle giants swim beneath the waves, this new DAO, he said, could be created to dispense funds to researchers working to study the species as a whole.  The project would further envision how DAOs might be used by charities, potentially removing some of the issues consumers have long voiced with the centralized management of non-profit entities.  To add further curiosity to the story, the idea is, no joke, based on concepts from medieval law.  DuPont told CoinDesk.  ""To really see the benefit of a human-whale-robot hybrid organization, we are reviving the concept of a deodand. A deodand is a medieval legal idea that all created things have legal status, and therefore have the same rights and duties as humans. For us, our interest is only to study how far we can push the DAO concept.""  The researchers, he explained, don’t have specific expertise in aquatic life, and could therefore seek to transition the DAO to others qualified to run the organization, should it launch with such a design.  Still, DuPont sees value in galvanizing a community around such an idea, as it would enable animals a way to exercise legal rights for the first time.  ""As the original author of the idea stated, 'This is not ‘save the whales,' it’s ‘Give the whales the tools to save themselves,'"" DuPont said.  The news comes just one week after the launch of first large-scale DAO — a DAO meant to fund Ethereum projects known as The DAO — confused international reporters and sparked a global conversation on the nature of how blockchain-based organizations empower the rights of participants.  To date, a wide range of experts, from tax attorneys to industry observers, have so far weighed in as part of an effort to develop public understanding of the emerging subject.  Project origins  While the project may seem like a last-minute idea meant to capitalize on public interest in a new technology, DuPont indicated that conversations have been underway about the project since as far back as early 2014.  It was then that users of an Ethereum.org discussion forum first began to theorize how DAOs could potentially serve the needs of those who are unable to represent themselves in a traditional court of law.  Still, DuPont said the success of The DAO has re-energized his team and helped to empower its vision.  ""I’ve thought about this idea for a while, this is a provocative entrance into DAOs. Then when The DAO came up, I thought this sounds like as good an opportunity as ever to explore,"" he said.  DuPont acknowledged the ""nuts and bolts"" of the idea have yet to be ironed out, but that the ""farcical example"", if properly developed and employed, could go a long way toward helping the public understand the power of blockchain-based DAOs.  Cultural anthropology  Currently, the plan is for the DAO to be led by Bill Maurer, a cultural anthropologist at UC Irvine, with support from DuPont and potentially other researchers who have yet to become more formally involved.  In statements, Maurer described the project in more scientific terms, framing it as one that grew out of his mandate to explore how bitcoin and blockchain technology are ""unleashing experiments with money and payment"".  ""Our engagement with the DAO is a way to use the classic method of cultural anthropology – participant-observation – in order to delve more deeply into this shift,"" he said.  In this way, he sees the ""Save the Whales DAO"", as DuPont called it, as a way to provide the researchers with ""linguistic familiarity"" on the topic so that they can engage others in conversations about the nature of DAOs.  How this will come to life remains to be seen, but DuPont envisions such a DAO could one day be involved in helping provide solutions to serious issues, such as the dangers sealife face from man-made catastrophes.  As for exactly how funds could be raised, how the documentation for the project would be formalized and when the DAO might exist, as the orca whales it derives inspiration from, in the wild, DuPont was less clear.  He concluded:  ""I would leave these things for the DAO to figure out.""

42426908,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxSRh,1463764596,Bitcoin Miners Follow Profit to Ethereum Blockchain,"The rush to capitalize on ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, is in full swing.  Among those interested are the world's miners, who operate vast networks of machines that process bitcoin transactions. Recent increases in the price of ether have sparked some bitcoin mine operators to expand their operations to cover it.  Miners operate by effectively bundling transactions and attempting to create groupings, or 'blocks', to be accepted by the network. They make money when the return of generating and selling cryptocurrencies exceeds the cost of the electricity required. Some have referred to mining as a form of resource arbitrage.  It's the opportunity to generate profits on the back of Ethereum's recent successes that has arguably attracted some bitcoin miners. For example, the co-founder of China-based BitBank, Chandler Guo took to Facebook to declare his plans to enter the ether mining ring. He wrote:  ""I am a miner of #ethereum.""  Guo, who was the subject of a recent profile by the BBC, made the announcement as part of what appears to be the beginning of a new crowdfunding campaign in which he’s offering 2 percent interest for every 100,000 ETH mined by the operation. On 12th May, Guo finished a successful crowdfunding campaign to collect 3,500 bitcoins at an offered interest rate of 14 percent.  Since then, Guo has begun sharing pictures from the Chinese operation, including the racks of graphics cards needed to mine ether.  Yet recent moves in the global mining space suggests that Guo is not alone among that community to at least test the waters of processing transactions on Ethereum as well as bitcoin.  Ether mining gains momentum  The multi-year history of bitcoin mining is, in part, a demonstration of technological evolution. From the early days of CPU mining to the massive ASIC-driven operations we see today, bitcoin's mining history has seen steady development of increasingly more sophisticated machinery.  Transaction processing on the Ethereum network, by comparison, is currently performed by the use of graphics cards (GPUs), and like bitcoin, the Ethereum network features a number of mining pools of varying size and influence. Long-term, there are plans to later switch to a proof-of-stake method of achieving transaction history consensus.  Other miners have made public their involvement as well.  F2Pool, which according to data from Blockchain.info has processed the most bitcoin blocks in the past 24 hours, has long operated a mining pool focused on Ethereum. In March, Virginia-based BTCS announed that it would begin a pilot program for ether mining.  More recently, Genesis Mining released several images of depicting what the company described as “the world’s largest Ethereum mine"" or “computational cluster”. Dubbed “Enigma” the Ethereum mining farm provides hosted mining services to global customers who want to be exposed to speculative value of ether, but who don't want to mine themselves.  Risks of pooling power  As bitcoin miners look to position themselves as transaction verifiers on the Ethereum network, it raises questions of whether the make-up of its mining community will see long-term change.  Of course, such a collection of mining power poses its own risks. The Ethereum network could be at risk of having its transaction history become mutable should a single entity gain majority control of the network (known more commonly as a 51% attack).  Yet plans to switch to a proof-of-stake system and a built-in resistance to ASICs could keep some major players out of the game, who in the absence of ASICs would be required to source and purchase graphic cards to add to their hashing power. As with bitcoin, the determining factor will be the price of ether, which at press time is $13.77.  According to Ethstats, the Ethereum network hashrate is 2.8 terahashes per second.

42426900,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxSDh,1463758499,Payments Giant Qiwi is Building a Blockchain Replacement for its Core Database,"Russian payments firm Qiwi is currently designing its own proprietary blockchain in an effort to replace its central payments processing database.  Called the ""Qiwi blockchain system"", the company’s development effort focuses on how its core database of customer transactions could be reimagined to reduce costs.  Qiwi is one of the largest payment service providers in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) region, with more than 16.1 million digital wallet users and 62 million transacting customers per month.  Today, according to the company, all customer transactions are processed through a ""database with two tables"" that logs all customer transactions and keeps the balances of each account. Qiwi hopes to reimagine this process so that users would sign traditional transactions in the back end with a private key that they would use to control their account, and that would speak to and update and update its central ledger.  In interview, Qiwi communications director Konstantin Koltsov explained the impetus for the test and how the company hopes it will improve its operations.  Koltsov told CoinDesk:  ""[When] you have centralized processing, you have to pay more for security, to protect it, to maintain it physically, [to ensure] proper maintenance. You have costs to maintain all the technical infrastructure. We are testing the system to see if it may see a cost reduction for this initiative.""  Alexey Troshichev, blockchain processing architect at QIWI, explained that this system seeks the same efficiencies as the bitcoin blockchain, where miners receive transactions, and once proof of work is completed, seal these transactions into a block.  ""We will collect transactions like the miners do, and once we [validate the transactions], we will produce or release this transaction with a block into the world. As a result the people will see, the users of the system will be public and proved,"" he said.  Troshichev said Qiwi is working to build a custom blockchain system to meet this need given what it sees as the inadequacies of existing private and public blockchains.  ""We see bitcoin and Ethereum as workshops or labs, which perform continued ideas checking, so we can choose elements which will suit our needs. The private blockchain systems we have reviewed either have the same architecture drawbacks as the public systems or lack [key] operating features,"" he continued.  For now, Qiwi disclosed that the system is undergoing ""internal testing"" but that it could seek to launch the blockchain service in parallel with its current processing system should it pass initial evaluations.  Transparent services  In addition to simply cutting costs, Qiwi sees the service as one that could provide its system with some of the transparency afforded by the bitcoin blockchain.  Troshichev explained that, with a blockchain back-end system, consumer and merchant customers would be able to trust that their transactions are immutable and that all transactions could be verified independently.  ""We are creating a system which will receive requests to process transactions and produces a blockchain, which will allow anyone to check reliability of the transactions,"" he said.  Troshichev is optimistic that the benefits of transparency and accountability could increase end-user satisfaction with Qiwi’s services, thereby driving more user acquisition.  ""The problem with bitcoin, you will find, if you meet someone on the street [and show how bitcoin works], the person will not be impressed, if [he or she] compares it to the convenience with a card transaction,"" he said.  However, he stressed that he believes it is these back-end benefits, not the front-end benefits of owning and managing those funds as bitcoin users do by maintaining their respective digital assets, will eventually encourage more users to the service.  ""There are merchants interested in this kind of a system, and if you have the big merchants, in the this ecosystem, you will have great user acquisition, and once you have a user acquisition, you get more value,"" he said.  Square one  But, Qiwi’s blockchain system, while having some of the transparency features of a public blockchain system, is envisioned as a private ledger.  Under the design, Qiwi would control all the nodes that process transactions, but in doing so, the company hopes to achieve a greater scalability for the system.  Qiwi’s goal is to be able to process transactions “in milliseconds”, and that millions of the transactions made by its users could be processed each day.  ""Unfortunately we cannot use neither one of public blockchain systems for our tasks,"" Troshichev said.  Troshichev went on to say that the system aims to use torrents in the same as distributed content delivery networks, as part of an effort to reduce the time that would be needed for new users to download a full copy of the Qiwi blockchain.  ""It’s not a comfortable part of the protocol, you have to just download slowly a huge amount of the data. People will use the torrent to distribute between nodes,"" he said.  Qiwi also intends to use an API that would help it manage spikes in the number of transactions the network would need to process, allowing it to better disperse data, though he said this part of the system would also remain closed.  ""This piece of the system is not open. We need to have the full control here, we need it for predictable time of operations,"" he said.  Blockchain vision  The project is the latest, and perhaps most ambitious, for the Russian payments giant, which has been investigating applications of digital currencies and blockchain tech since mid-2015.  It was then that the company first unveiled its ""BitRuble"" project. Aimed at replicating traditional fiat currencies using a blockchain, Qiwi has since indicated it will continue similar research, announcing last month it was seeking to lead a regional blockchain consortium.  Troshichev indicated that the project is part of a larger goal to build an “ecosystem” for blockchain technology that can improve some of Qiwi’s core services.  A key difference between Qiwi and major banks experimenting with the technology, Troshichev argued, is that it will have retail users who will be more interested in new types of services that provide benefits, and less susceptible to regulatory risk.  While the question of regulation still looms in Russia, Troshichev said that discussions are now being had, and that key members of the government are beginning to be educated on why digital currency and blockchain technology are symbiotic in nature.  Still, he indicated that delivering benefits to consumers was key to this broader educational process.  Troshichev concluded:  ""Our vision is to get the value to the retail user, to add this value.""
