25143828,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=601083,1712098844,"Bitcoin Price Plummets As US Government Transfers $2B In Seized Silk Road BTC, Coincidence?","The crypto market is abuzz with speculation as the US government recently moved significantly regarding seized Bitcoin (BTC) linked to the infamous Silk Road dark web marketplace. This development comes at a critical time for the Bitcoin price, which has struggled to maintain its position above the $70,000 threshold after hitting its current all-time high (ATH) of $73,700 on March 14. As the largest cryptocurrency experiences yet another round of price correction, the movement of these seized funds has triggered intense speculation about a potential sell-off by the US government. Seized Silk Road BTC On The Move According to on-chain data, a wallet linked to the US government recently transferred 30,175 Bitcoin, seized from the Silk Road dark web marketplace. Related Reading: Ethereum And Altcoins Crash: Why Is This Analyst Super Bullish? This transfer follows the earlier seizure of over 50,000 Bitcoin from James Zhong, who illegally obtained the cryptocurrency from the Silk Road in 2012. The US Department of Justice’s (DOJ) seizure of these funds marked the largest cryptocurrency seizure in its history. This is not the first instance of the US government moving Bitcoin obtained from criminal cases. In March 2022, the government sold 9,800 Bitcoin, with plans to sell an additional 41,500 BTC. However, the recent transfer of the 30,175 BTC from Silk Road-related addresses has raised questions about the fate of these funds and their potential impact on the Bitcoin price correction. Benjamin Skew, an on-chain data expert, took to social media to offer insights into the situation. Skew clarified that although there is chaos surrounding the Silk Road Bitcoin being sent to Coinbase for sale, a closer examination reveals that the main funds were transferred to a newly created wallet that remains inactive. However, Skew stated that 2,000 BTC of the total amount was transferred to the alleged Coinbase wallet for undisclosed purposes, while the rest was sent to a newly created wallet. 200EMA Support Crucial For The Bitcoin Price The Bitcoin price is currently witnessing a lack of bullish momentum as the cryptocurrency continues to face resistance in consolidating above the crucial $70,000 threshold. However, there is still hope on the horizon. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlights the importance of the 200-epimetric moving average (EMA) on the 4-hour chart of BTC. According to Martinez, this indicator has acted as formidable support since early February and continues to play a crucial role in preventing further downward movement. Related Reading: Tether Buys 8,888 Bitcoin For $618 Million, But Why Is Price Down? The focus on the 200EMA stems from its potential to either catalyze a rebound or trigger more losses for Bitcoin. Martinez stated that if the 200EMA continues to hold as strong support, it signifies a significant probability of a price rebound. This scenario would provide renewed bullish momentum and potentially propel Bitcoin’s price above the $70,000 mark. However, if the 200EMA is broken, as it was in mid-January, as seen in the chart below, the analyst suggests that this could expose the Bitcoin price to further downward pressure and potentially lead to further losses. Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $65,390, continuing its recent price correction. Over the past 24 hours, BTC has experienced a 5% decline; over the past seven days, it has seen a significant drop of over 6%. The market closely monitors whether the current key support level can sustain further price drops or if a potential bounce will occur before reaching that point. The outcome of these scenarios remains uncertain.

25141877,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=600967,1712095251,Solana Whales Are Making Moves – Here’s The Direction They’re Headed In,"The price of Solana had briefly crossed $200 before tumbling back down in the last week. This move has triggered a wave of movement across the market, and whales are now showing their hands. Over the last day, there have been a number of notable whale transactions and their destinations could give an inkling as to how these large crypto investors are looking at the market right now. Solana Whales Move Hundreds Of Millions Worth Of SOL The whale movements began on Monday when the market had first begun to slow down, with the Solana price falling below $190. The on-chain data tracking platform Whale Alert, reported these transactions, a number of which seemed to happened right next to one another. Related Reading: Bitcoin Halving Inches Closer With Less Than 2,900 Blocks Left The first transaction was one carrying 993,453 SOL which was worth $189.55 million at the time. Then minutes later, the tracker reported the movement of another 1,895,729 SOL worth $361.7 million. Not too long after, it reported a third transaction carrying 1,096,940 SOL worth $209.29 million. Then, the last transaction in this row of transactions was 1 million SOL, valued at $190 million at the time of the transaction. Now, all of these Solana transactions had originated from unknown wallets and their destination were also unknown wallets. This means that the owners of these wallets are not publicly known and their addressed have not been tagged. In such cases, it could suggest that these whales are selling their tokens over the counter in order to minimize the impact of their selling on the market market. However, it could also be that these whales are just redistributing their coins. Nevertheless, the whale movements didn’t end here as a couple of hours later, the on-chain tracker would report the movement of massive amounts of SOL once more. This time around, a whale moved 149,999 SOL worth a little over $27.79 million from an unknown wallet to the Binance exchange. This transaction deviates from the previous four transactions in the fact that its destination is a crypto exchange. Usually, when investors move their coins to exchanges such as Binance, it is to sell their tokens and a $27.79 million sale could put a lot of pressure on the SOL price. Related Reading: Forget Bitcoin, Altcoins Are The Winners Of This Cycle, Crypto Analyst Says The next whale transaction reported after this was an amore positive one though which involved the movement of 146,121 SOL worth $26.83 million from the Kraken exchange to an unknown wallet. In this case, it is likely that the whale is withdrawing their coins for safekeeping as they wait for better prices. This reduces the selling pressure on the asset. Even with these whale movements, the SOL price continues to hold up quite nicely. If the selling pressure continues to fall and the pressure from Bitcoin’s price decline is finally lifted, then SOL price could quickly rally above $200 once again.

42418491,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThT93,1712093126,The SEC’s Shot Across the Bow on 'AI Washing',"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has trained its sights on “AI washing:” when companies lie about using artificial intelligence.  Last week, SEC Chair Gary Gensler posted a video to X warning that investment advisors might falsely claim to use AI models to get their clients a better return, and that public companies might falsely tout their AI technology to boost stock prices.  Daren Firestone is a lawyer who helps whistleblowers earn rewards for exposing fraud. He is a partner at Levy Firestone Muse and created cryptowhistleblower.com.  “Well, here at the SEC,” Gensler warned, “we want to make sure that these folks are telling the truth.”  The same day, the SEC announced it had settled charges with two investment advisors: Delphia and Global Predictions. The SEC’s order sanctioned the “robo advisor business” Delphia, which held $187 million in assets under management, for allegedly making claims it used “machine learning to analyze the collective data shared by its members to make intelligent investment decisions.”  That wasn’t true when Delphia first made those claims in a December 2019 press release, and it wouldn’t become true as it continued to make similar claims well into 2023, according to the SEC.  The second company settling with the SEC, Global Predictions, claimed to use “[e]xpert AI driven forecasts,” when, according to the agency's blunt assessment, “in fact it did not.” Asked by the SEC to substantiate its claim to be the “first regulated AI financial advisor,” Global Predictions “could not produce documents” to do so.  Collectively, the two companies paid fines totaling $400,000, not a lot by SEC standards, but this is a shot across the bow, a warning that the SEC won’t tolerate AI washing.  The SEC is right to be aggressive. As of Jan. 18, there were 353,928 .ai domain names registered. How many of those 353,928 domains belong to a company that actually uses AI?  Admittedly, AI is a broad category. IBM, for example, defines AI as “technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human intelligence and problem-solving capabilities.” When, as one commentator has asked, “does something go from being a Fax machine to being Samantha from Her or HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey? Where do we draw the line?”  See also: Daren Firestone — AI+Crypto: Trouble | Opinion  The SEC will aim to avoid such esoterica by targeting lies that it can prove in court. Another example: in February, the SEC filed a complaint against Brian Sewell and his company Rockwell Capital Management LLC. Sewell allegedly raised $1.2 million for a fund to invest in cryptocurrency trading that he claimed would employ “machine algorithms,” “artificial intelligence” and a “machine learning model.”  “In reality,” the SEC alleged, “Sewell and the Fund had none of these things.”  AI is the next big thing. Investors know that. So do fraudsters seeking to take advantage of investor enthusiasm. The SEC is right to send a warning to those fraudsters.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Daren Firestone,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/04/02/the-secs-shot-across-the-bow-on-ai-washing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e9266feac47af2efb0e63d06bff2900b7b377789-2118x1192.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

25139938,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=601066,1712091655,MakerDAO Initiates Massive $600 Million DAI Investment In USDe And sUSDe,"Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocol MakerDAO is considering allocating 600 million DAI stablecoins to the USDe and staked USDe (sUSDe) protocols through the DeFi lending platform Morpho Labs. The proposed allocation aims to improve risk management and maximize user incentives in the DeFi landscape. MakerDAO Sets Maximum 600 Million DAI Allocation The Spark DAI Vault, launched in 2023 as a lending platform, experienced strong demand soon after its launch, according to MakerDAO’s announcement on the protocol’s governance forum. Related Reading: Tether Buys 8,888 Bitcoin For $618 Million, But Why Is Price Down? Given the desire to keep liquidity risk at an acceptable level, MakerDAO proposes a greater allocation of DAI to the USDe pools, which can be immediately redeemed via Ethena (ENA), a synthetic dollar protocol developed on the Ethereum blockchain. This reallocation also allows Ethena to retain a larger revenue share for their insurance fund, potentially improving the overall risk profile of MakerDAO’s Ethena allocation. Furthermore, MakerDAO recommends focusing future allocations on the 86% and 91.5% Loan-To-Liquidity-Value (LLTV) pools, which have shown “higher efficiency” regarding borrow rates and user demand. While lower LLTV pools, such as the 77% and 94.5% pools, will continue to receive allocations, they will be proportionally lower than the two primary pools. To mitigate potential insolvency risks and ensure a favorable risk-reward ratio, MakerDAO limits the total allocation to 600 million DAI. However, the Dividend Debt Mechanism (DDM) line parameter is set at 1 billion DAI to provide flexibility for future increases if constraints change. In addition, MakerDAO recommends marginally increasing the funds deployed in the 77% and 94.5% pools to 10 million DAI each to ensure sufficient pool size for “efficient management of positions” and the calibration of interest rate models. The recently unveiled Ethena points program for Season 2 introduces a $500 million cap on total eligible collateral for incentives on Morpho. If demand for DAI borrowing through the vault declines after this threshold is reached, the protocol states that Multisig can reduce allocations below $600 million to maintain a balanced supply/demand dynamic and align with expected collateral returns. MKR Surges To Near Three-Year High MakerDAO’s native token, MKR, hit a nearly three-year high of $4,074 on Sunday, which is 40% below its current all-time high (ATH) of $6,292 in May 2023. The token has pulled back nearly 2% and is currently trading at $3,717. It is consolidating above its next support level of $3,640. Despite the retracement, MKR still boasts significant gains over longer time frames. It has posted a 25% gain over the past fourteen days and an impressive 80% gain over the past thirty days. Related Reading: Solana Price Could Explode By 80% If This Happens: Crypto Analyst Demand for MKR tokens is evident as trading volume has increased to $274,659,607 over the past 24 hours, a substantial 40% increase from just one day ago, according to CoinGecko data. In addition, MKR’s market capitalization has seen a remarkable increase of nearly 100% over the past month. Starting in March with a market cap of $1.8 billion, as of the most recent update on April 2nd, the market cap stands at $3.46 billion. This significant increase underscores the high level of interest in the MakerDAO protocol and its native token.

42418521,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThT4v,1712091189,Memes to Millions: The Tax Implications of Sudden Crypto Wealth,"Meme coin seasons are known for frenzied market activity, driven by the meteoric rise of viral crypto projects that transform modest investments into fortunes overnight. The world knows dogecoin {{DOGE}} is the original meme coin, but a gang of newcomers has stormed the 2024 meme season. There’s a puppy wif a hat {{WIF}}, a smirking frog {{PEPE}}, a clumsy sloth {{SLERF}} and more.  Memes are fun, especially when you find six or even seven figures in your portfolio overnight. But with market mania and potential for generational wealth come tax considerations and the potential for astronomical mistakes.  Zac McClure, MBA, is the co-founder and CEO of TokenTax.  SLERF is a prime example of the possible tax pitfalls that lurk during meme mania. At TokenTax, we think about crypto taxes every day and had to weigh in:  While most meme millionaires won’t face such an extreme scenario, there are tax considerations to remember during meme season and after the party stops. It's important info to bare in mind, as ""Tax Day,"" individual income tax returns are due to be submitted to the federal government, approaches this April 15.  Trader beware: Know your tax liability for every trade  U.S. taxpayers don’t need to sell crypto for USD to create tax consequences. Crypto-for-crypto trades trigger taxable events, and not knowing or ignoring this can lead to bad outcomes. It's tempting to invest meme profits into another crypto without parking your future tax bill in stablecoins or cash. If your portfolio then plummets, this can leave you with massive tax debt. Ouch.  Trading crypto for crypto in the U.S. and many other regions is taxable, so it's possible to ""make it"" on paper during meme season, then lose it all when the market turns and the tax man expects his cut. Investors should consider their tax obligations with every trade and plan accordingly.  You’ve 'made it': Tax season after crypto wealth  Congratulations, you made it trading memes. Let’s talk taxes. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) considers crypto to be property. Crypto taxes for U.S. taxpayers are the same as short- and long-term capital gains for stocks or regular income tax. Briefly:  Short-term capital gains from crypto held for less than a year are subject to income tax rates ranging from 10%-37%, depending on tax bracket and income.  Long-term capital gains on profits from crypto held for more than a year have a 0%-20% rate.  Crypto received from staking is taxed as ordinary income upon receipt and then again as capital gains on later profits.  For more information, see our guide to crypto tax. Tax consequences will vary for taxpayers from state to state and internationally, and we suggest consulting with a crypto tax professional and your local authorities for guidance.  2 crypto sales strategies for tax efficiency  There are a couple of main ways most taxpayers can optimize their crypto sales to minimize taxes:  Hold long-term: Holding a given crypto for longer than a year typically qualifies you for long-term capital gains rates, which are generally lower.  Tax-loss harvest: This strategy involves selling assets at a loss during market dips or at the end of the year to offset capital gains and potentially lower your tax liability. U.S. taxpayers can sell unlimited crypto at a loss. If capital losses exceed gains, you may be able to deduct up to $3,000 per year to offset ordinary income. Remaining losses can be carried forward to offset capital gains or income in the future.  Watch out for wash sales  A wash sale occurs when someone sells a crypto or security for a loss and quickly rebuys the same or similar crypto or security to receive tax benefits. The wash sale rule prohibits selling securities at a loss and reacquiring them within 30 days to prevent taxpayers from making ""artificial"" losses to lower tax liability.  While the IRS hasn’t yet applied the wash sale rule to cryptocurrencies, proposals have aimed to extend it to digital assets. Investors should exercise caution and consult with crypto tax professionals before engaging in activities that could be considered wash sales.  After meme season? Tax season…  The sobering reality of tax planning naturally follows the euphoria of meme season. Accurate record-keeping is essential.

Analyst Warns Of Bearish Future If ETH Drops Below This Level,"Ethereum (ETH) showed a notable performance throughout March. The second largest cryptocurrency hit $4,000 twice and seemed ready for lift-off to a new all-time high (ATH) while the whole crypto market soared. Quarter one (Q1) 2024 closed with important achievements for the crypto community. However, as Q2 started, Bitcoin began a correction that dragged Ethereum and the rest of the crypto market. Related Reading: Investor Alert: Ethereum Q2 Potential Promises Double-Digit Gains – Analyst Are Ethereum Bulls In Problems? The king of altcoins has registered red numbers for the past two days. ETH’s momentum recovery after the market slowdown was halted after the token followed BTC and the rest of the market. On Monday, crypto analyst Ali Martinez expressed concerns about Ether’s future. He suggested investors should “always be prepared for the best and the worst” scenario. Martinez deemed “breaching the $3,400 support level” as the most brutal scenario for the second-largest cryptocurrency. This move would confirm a bear pennant pattern that formed on the daily chart. If confirmed, the bearish formation could trigger ETH’s price to face a “major correction,” according to the analyst. The correction could make Ether’s price dip to $2,800. Martinez reaffirmed his analysis after Ethereum continued to dip in the early hours of Tuesday. After the token fell under the support level mentioned above, the analyst asserted that falling under $3,460 was a problem for the bulls. #Ethereum dropping below $3,460 is a problem for the bulls! Given the lack of support, it increases the chances for a further $ETH correction toward $2,850 or lower. pic.twitter.com/dFpnpZtBVM — Ali (@ali_charts) April 2, 2024 “Given the lack of support,” failing to regain this support zone could trigger further corrections for ETH that could go even lower than the previously forecasted $2,800. According to the In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) chart shared by Martinez, Ethereum shows a potential price support between $2,846 and $2,905, with over 1.64 million ETH bought by 1.99 million addresses at this level. Nonetheless, the chart also displays that an ETH rally could face resistance at $3,457 and $3,557. ETH’s Follows Bitcoin’s Correction Ethereum behaved no differently than the rest of the crypto market. Bitcoin’s correction saw its price drop from the $70,000 mark to hover between the $65,000-$64,000 price range. The flagship cryptocurrency shredded 7.1% of its price in the last 24 hours. Similarly, Ethereum’s red numbers show a 7.4% drop from yesterday and a 7.5% decrease on Monday. April fools shakeout to start the quarter. Time to get to work.

This follows DOGE’s recent price surge, which saw the crypto token rise to a new three-year high of $0.22. Dogecoin Witnesses Wave Of Profit-Taking Data from the market intelligence platform Santiment shows a drop in the number of Dogecoin holders holding between 10 million and 100 million DOGE tokens. This suggests that some holders have offloaded their tokens to secure profits from DOGE’s recent price gains. Related Reading: Hedge Fund Manager Predicts When Bitcoin Price Will Reach $150,000 This wave of profit-taking looks to have become a pattern among DOGE holders, as further data from Santimemt showed that these whales also instantly booked their profits just after DOGE enjoyed an upward trend earlier in March. Bitcoinist even reported then of a Dogecoin whale that offloaded 86 million DOGE tokens on the market. Considering the magnitude of these whales’ holdings, their actions are bound to exert much selling pressure on the DOGE token. That explains why the meme coin has steadily declined since rising to as high as $0.22 last week. Interestingly, Santiment, in an X (formerly Twitter) post, had recently warned of an impending sell-off by these whales. The crypto analytics platform noted how major dormant whales were moving their Dogecoin holdings back into circulation, which usually suggests they are getting ready to sell. Meanwhile, members of the DOGE community seem unfazed by the recent price dip, with many of them seeing it as an opportunity to accumulate more of the meme coin. The Whales Will Soon Return Dogecoin whales are expected to return and position themselves again once this wave of profit-taking by them is done. Besides taking profits, these whales also see this period as an opportunity to invest in DOGE at the market bottom and in anticipation of future price gains. Related Reading: Bitcoin Halving Inches Closer With Less Than 2,900 Blocks Left Despite this recent correction, there looks to be a lot of bullish momentum on the largest meme coin by market cap, especially with analysts predicting that it could rise to $1 in this market cycle. In the short term, Dogecoin is also expected to make another run soon, with significant events coming up for the meme coin this April. The foremost US exchange, Coinbase, is set to launch Dogecoin futures for its institutional clients on April 29. This move could cause new money to flow into the meme coin’s ecosystem and spark a price surge. DOGE Day is also happening on April 20, which will put the spotlight on the crypto token and possibly impact its price positively. At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at around $0.18, down over 6% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Crypto projects, specifically in the United States, received more than $1.16 billion last month, the second-highest amount in the past 12 months.  The majority of capital went into projects related to crypto infrastructure and decentralized finance (DeFi).  Venture capitalists increased their investments into crypto projects by over 52% in March, spurred by a new all-time high for bitcoin and continued success from the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).  Investors allocated more than $1.16 billion into the industry in March, the second-highest amount in the past 12 months, according to data released by RootData.  The majority of the capital went into projects working on crypto infrastructure and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, especially those built on the Ethereum blockchain, the data shows. Other popular blockchains included Polygon and BNB Chain.  The surge in fundraising comes as bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $73,798 on March 14, which experts say was accelerated by the better-than-expected inflows into the newly launched spot bitcoin ETFs.  The ten ETFs, which include issuers like BlackRock and Fidelity, spurred renewed faith in the industry as TradFi leaders once again voiced their interest in digital assets.  More than half of the investments in March were between $1 million and $5 million and were used as seed capital, while allocations of over $20 million made up roughly 10% of all investments.  Roughly a third of the capital was allocated to projects located in the United States, according to RootData.

The chief investment officer of the banks Wealth Management unit, Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, says clients have not voiced interest in exposure to the asset class, even after the latest surge in prices.  Goldman Sachs, nowadays one of the few Wall Street banks to do so, isn’t backing away from its negative stance against crypto, as it doesn’t see any value in the asset.  Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, chief investment officer of the bank's Wealth Management unit, has long been known for her skepticism of bitcoin and other digital assets, and her opinion hasn’t changed, according to a recent interview.  “We do not think it is an investment asset class,” she told the Wall Street Journal, “We’re not believers in crypto.”  Even after TradFi competitors such as BlackRock and Fidelity earlier this year decided to double down on their efforts in the crypto industry after clients expressed their interest in getting exposure specifically to bitcoin, Goldman’s clients want nothing to do with it, according to Mossavar-Rahmani.  One of the reasons she sees no value in the asset is because it’s not possible to really evaluate its worth. “If you cannot assign a value, then how can you be bullish or bearish?” she said.  She even criticized the industry for being hypocritical, saying that crypto enthusiasts “all proclaim democratization of finance, yet the main decisions end up being driven by a few controlling people.”  Unlike Goldman Sachs, many of its competitors have taken steps to participate in the crypto space.

42418519,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThVfx,1712080787,Are Bitcoin Developers Losing Faith in Lightning?,"Ah, the Lightning Network. Hailed for years as Bitcoin’s saving grace, the off-chain solution needed to finally make Satoshi Nakamoto’s “peer-to-peer digital cash” an actual functioning payments network, today appears to be losing faith.  Industry publication Protos recently published an article noting that numerous Lightning developers have walked away from the project, that there’s a growing list of complaints and bugs to address and that liquidity has been slowly drying up on the network.  Taken together it all gives the impression that, at the very least, it is becoming more acceptable to point out flaws in Bitcoin's leading scaling solution.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here. It was also published as part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package, which coincides with the fourth Bitcoin “halving” in April 2024.  This is all sort of true. Even as far back as 2019 the network's co-creator, Tadge Dryja, was willing to discuss the “limitations” of the scaling solution, and stopped contributing directly to the project after a few disagreements over how to scale Bitcoin with leading Lightning developers Lightning Labs that year (just months after Lightning launched and nearly four years after it was first proposed).  Similarly, Joseph Poon, another co-author of the Lightning white paper, has seemingly become more interested in blockchain scaling solutions happening on other chains, like Ethereum’s Plasma. He is now working on a new type of decentralized exchange.  Over the years, numerous bugs have been found impacting Lightning and some of its implementations. In 2022, for instance, bad code in Lightning Labs’ favored implementation, LND, prevented users from moving funds onto the mainnet for several hours. (Though to be fair, more often than not vulnerabilities are patched before they’re even exploited.)  Other bitcoiners have raised concerns about Lightning’s many privacy issues and that the scaling solution often can be surprisingly expensive to use. In particular, they complain about the design of “inbound capacity” on Lightning, which limits the amount of BTC you can receive, so that users sometimes pay to receive funds (or, that payment is subsidized by startups).  The latest round of Bitcoin Lightning discourse appears to have been kicked off by longtime bitcoiner John Carvalho, who was once one of Lightning’s biggest champions until he tried building software solutions on top of it. His recent interview with Vlad Costea caught the ear after Carvalho derided the “complexity and fragility” of the protocol.  “Going through that experience has made me realize that the design is kind of a joke,” Carvalho said. “We can make it work. We can do our best, but all of the narratives that came with [Lightning] in the first couple years were really exaggerated.”  Indeed, it seems like there is a turning tide in sentiment around Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, which has been hyped as a potential replacement for Visa’s payment rails and the spur that will bring about “hyperbitcoinization.”  Inspired by Carvalho’s interview, Bitcoin developer Paul Sztorc published a long list of Lightning Network “black pills,” including doubts that it could scale to onboard the global population of more than 8 billion people, the ""channel risk"" of who you interact with, the fail rate of payments, and that amount of bitcoin posted to it is a “microscopic 00.025%” of circulating bitcoins.  Protos further noted the total amount of BTC on Lightning has been dwindling slowly, dipping below the 5,500 BTC level in December 2023 to about 4,750 BTC today. This might suggest that people are abandoning Lightning, though it’s worth noting the dollar value contributed to Lightning has doubled to about $320 million today versus $158 million this time last year.  Just looking at the data paints a confusing picture: the number of Lightning nodes is also dipping down from a peak in 2022 as are the number of connections between nodes, and yet the total transaction count has reportedly been trailing up.  See also: Bitcoin Lightning Exchange FixedFloat Sees 'Suspicious' Transactions  Reading the subjective and anecdotal accounts collated by Sztorc, who has been advocating for an alternative way of scaling Bitcoin through “drivechains,” paints a more damning picture. All within the past year, highly respected Bitcoin Core developer BlueMatt called Lightning “a joke.” Lightning security researcher Antonie Riard left the project (publishing a highly critical blog). And FiatJaf, creator of the popular social network Nostr, spoke of his dwindling confidence.  CoinDesk doesn’t pretend to have the answers here, though it would appear that, at best, Lightning’s growth is a bit static. But to say public perception has changed on Lightning would likely be to overstate the case; people have been saying for years that Lightning is overhyped and that its fanatics were setting unrealistic expectations.  In fact, Lightning co-creators Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja said from the beginning that it would not solve all of Bitcoin’s scalability needs. There’s a reason why the meme around Lightning is that it’s always “18 months away.”  While it’s hard to argue with critics that too much was promised for Lightning too fast (especially during the hype of the last bull market), it’s important to put the conversations in context. When the network officially launched in 2019, after years of testing, bitcoiners often warned that it was an “experimental” solution.  Around the time of the first large scale test of the Lightning network — (the “Lightning torch” passed around the world to raise funds after Craig “Faketoshi” Wright sued the random bitcoin supporter Hodlonaut) — there was a trending hashtag warning users that it was #reckless to use Lightning, and to send only an amount you were willing to lose.  See also: Craig Wright Was Finally Called Out in Court and Hodlonaut Is Celebrating  There were and still are legitimate complaints about the Lightning network, which should be aired if anything will be improved. It is difficult and expensive to open and close channels. There are numerous security and scalability issues. The custodial solutions that often make Lightning usable for everyday use reintroduce the problems of third parties Bitcoin was invented to solve.  If there is any saving grace, it is this: When it comes to Bitcoin, often its biggest supporters are its best critics.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/04/02/are-bitcoin-developers-losing-faith-in-lightning,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/64954535aa0fc5c974607f5eb76c2fca20996800-640x360.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, according to one analyst who sees a parallel in the current formation to the 2020 market cycle, they are gearing up for a potential surge. In a post on X, the analyst says that often, after a period of accumulation and a retest of previous highs, altcoins tend to be volatile. The crypto analyst also notes that Bitcoin has pulled back from its all-time highs and is preparing for a possible retest of this level registered in March. Though altcoins have been decimated, looking at price action in the past 24 hours, altcoins are on a bullish path, similar to the last cycle registered in 2020. The analyst says Bitcoin will catalyze the altcoin swing to fresh levels and valuations. Will Altcoins Repeat The 2020 Cycle? For now, it is hard to predict the exact valuation of top altcoins. However, the analyst notes a similar formation in the current price action. Related Reading: Bitcoin Final Dance: Analyst Eyes Final Peak Ahead Of Halving When altcoins consolidated after surging, prices tended to recover strongly. This spike was evident, especially once Bitcoin broke through critical liquidation levels and entered “price discovery” or fresh all-time highs. Currently, Bitcoin is in this position. The coin is trading lower and cooling off from all-time highs. Even after higher highs last week, bulls didn’t break the $71,700 level in the daily chart. With BTC collapsing, altcoins also fell, with Ethereum, Solana, and top coins slipping below support levels. Will Ethereum And Other Altcoins Bounce Back Strongly? The altcoin season might come earlier this time, especially once Bitcoin recovers. Possible triggers include the upcoming Bitcoin halving event. Analysts claim that halving will likely create a supply crisis, causing scarcity. If institutions funnel the same demand level, BTC will likely rip higher, breaking $71,700 and even $73,800 all-time highs. Beyond this, upcoming network upgrades in Ethereum, like the recently mentioned “Purge” and Firedancer integration in Solana, might trigger demand. Developers are working towards Voltaire in Cardano. All these changes plan to make the top smart contracts platform more reliable and enhance performance. Related Reading: Tether Buys 8,888 Bitcoin For $618 Million, But Why Is Price Down? Besides network upgrades, analysts are considering the possible approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). If the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves this product, ETH might benefit by lifting others. It might also accelerate the drafting of fitting laws, especially now that BlackRock thinks tokenization and real-world assets (RWAs) are the future of finance.

42418514,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThVan,1712078623,Argentina President Milei Disappoints Some Bitcoiners as Crypto Registration Rule Begins,"Argentina last week moved forward with implementing a Registry of Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASP), drawing some outcry from those who hoped the nation might be heading in the direction of El Salvador's welcoming of Bitcoin.  The new law means platforms and individuals who purchase, sell, send or trade cryptocurrencies must adhere to a registration process. While the regulation appears to have been left over by the previous government, the fact that it's moved forward and has now become law under President Javier Milei is disappointing to those who imagined Latin America was going to get another bitcoin-friendly leader.  “Javier Milei makes his first major mistake,” tweeted Max Kieser, a longtime Bitcoin maxi and an advisor to El Salvador President Nayib Bukele. “He never took the time to understand #Bitcoin, now he’ll suffer the consequences.” El Salvador under Bukele in 2021 became the first nation on the globe to make bitcoin legal tender.  The libertarian Milei, who had previously lauded Bitcoin as a safe haven against central banking and inflation, came to power in December 2023 amid triple digit annual inflation. To this point, he's had some success trimming the size and scope of the government, with Argentina this year posting its first monthly budget surplus since 2011. The monthly inflation rate fell to 13.2% in February from 20.6% in January and 25.5% the month before that.  To be sure, not everyone views the new VASP law as negative. “If Argentina wants more access to foreign investment, this [the new regulation] is one of the things that needed to be implemented,” said an Argentina resident on X.

Recent market dynamics have seen Bitcoin leading the surge of inflows into crypto investment products, signaling a possible resumption of bullish sentiment. James Butterfill, head of research at Coinshares, reported this inflow in a social media post. The statistics indicate that crypto investment products received inflows of $862 million over the timeframe spanning from March 23 to March 29 to reverse the record net outflows of $942 million set in the prior week. Unsurprisingly, most of the inflow went into Bitcoin, hinting at a potential buying opportunity for investors still waiting to get in on the asset during this bull run. Institutional Investors Pump $862 Million Into Crypto Market James Butterfill termed the inflow registered last week as a “recovery for ETFs.” This is rightly so, as these US-based Spot Bitcoin ETFs gave investors a scare in the prior week with lackluster inflow, hinting at the possibility that the bull run could be coming to an end. This led to crypto investment products bleeding for the first time after seven consecutive weeks of inflows. Related Reading: Forget Bitcoin, Altcoins Are The Winners Of This Cycle, Crypto Analyst Says However, it would seem the sentiment regarding Spot Bitcoin ETFs is now back to a very bullish outlook. As a result, Bitcoin registered $865 million in inflows to bring its year-to-date inflow to $12.83 billion. On the other hand, Ethereum and multi-asset products registered $18.9 million and $2.6 million in outflows, respectively, to offset some of the inflows registered by Bitcoin. Inflows of $6.1 million, $0.2 million, $0.3 million, $1.1 million, and $2.4 million were recorded for Solana, Litecoin, XRP, and Polkadot, respectively. Polkadot also registered an inflow of $2.4 million. Short Bitcoin products, on the other hand, witnessed outflows of $2 million. Source: CoinShares Buying Opportunity For Bitcoin? Bitcoin’s price surge for the past few months has largely been due to action surrounding Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Interestingly, last week’s inflow activity saw Bitcoin breaking into the $70,000 price territory multiple times last week. This bullish momentum wasn’t sustained, allowing the bears to create a resistance at around $71,000. Related Reading: Hedge Fund Manager Predicts When Bitcoin Price Will Reach $150,000 Nevertheless, the inflow indicates something bullish might be brewing behind the scenes. Fundamentals surrounding the crypto point to a bullish price action throughout April, particularly as the next halving approaches. Bitcoin went through bearish price action over the weekend, correcting by almost 7% from $71,285. At the time of writing, Bitcoin has broken below a support at $68,500 and is now trading at $66,510. According to Santiment, the price dip has given crypto traders a sense of buying opportunity with calls of “buy and bullish” spiking across social media.

42418516,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThVcr,1712073508,Crypto Exchange Figure Markets Has a Plan to Democratize Finance,"Figure Markets combines alternative trading system capabilities with cross-collateralization of crypto and traditional assets.  MPC wallets matched with a goal of delivering a fully on-chain order book meet CEO Mike Cagney’s definition of a decentralized exchange.  Figure is using about $100 million from its balance sheet as a catalyst to drive borrowing and lending.  At first glance, Figure Markets, the cryptocurrency exchange recently unveiled by serial entrepreneur Mike Cagney, looks like another post-FTX trading-and-custody play aimed at institutions. But dig deeper, and a spectrum of value propositions appears, from cost-saving practicalities to visionary disruption.  Key components include: an alternative trading system (ATS), a broker-dealer license, the ability to cross-collateralize crypto and real-world assets, and borrowing and lending using Figure Technologies’ balance sheet as a catalyst to get things flowing. All this is underpinned by multiparty computation (MPC) wallets, a largely decentralized order book and the backing of market maker Jump Trading.  It’s definitely true that the billions of dollars of assets marooned on FTX prompted a rethink of crypto exchanges. For Figure Markets, the need to build an exchange evolved out of sister company Figure Technologies’ history of tokenizing non-crypto assets (over $30 billion since 2018) using the Cosmos-based Provenance Blockchain built by the firm.  By Cagney’s own admission, experimental efforts such as creating an on-chain market in private company shares and trading Figure stock on the ATS, failed to gain traction. Likewise, onboarding heavy hitters such as Apollo to trade on-chain fund interests didn’t work either.  Focus on market structure  Cagney remains chirpy about this learning curve. “These are two very popular business models that people are pitching right now for blockchain. We've done them both and I can tell you neither work,” he said in an interview with CoinDesk. “So, we decided to take a step back and look at market structure. The thing that stuck out was Binance and Coinbase function the same way as FTX did, even after what happened there. They act as custodian and clearing agent.”  The right direction was to use MPC, based on Jump Crypto's Silo offering, which represents a security-perfected interest that’s analogous to self-custody, and effectively delivers Cagney’s concept of a “decentralized exchange.”  Cagney's version differs from a DEX in the sense of decentralized finance (DeFi), where anonymous parties trade using an automated market maker (AMM). It instead features a limit order book, but one that’s as close to being on-chain as is technologically possible to deploy at scale.  “We can't scale that to a level to be competitive with Binance and Coinbase,” he said. “So you end up having to bring some order matching construct off chain, where you write back to the chain every five seconds. For five seconds, you're using some centralized construct of orders, but you're still not taking possession of the collateral which is important.”  In any case, Cagney’s view is that AMMs are not good for consumers. “Everyone pounds their chests about AMMs, but the reality is AMMs get exploited constantly by market makers sandwich-attacking retail clients that trade on them. The real panacea is when we get suitable blockchain computation. But until then, we have to run episodic off chain matching to just meet the throughput that we need. That isn't disingenuous to the thesis of decentralization, or at least is in line with it.”  Market makers like Jump saw huge value, both in Figure Markets’ decentralization, as well as the possibilities of cross-collateralization. But they flagged another issue, the problem around liquidity for lend/borrow, and the ability to access capital from a lend/borrow standpoint, Cagney said. “Look at the prime brokers in crypto, there's really only somewhere in the hundreds of millions of dollars of capital available to lend in an industry that could easily consume billions of dollars of capital a day.”  To deal with that, Cagney has apportioned about $100 million from Figure’s balance sheet to get the lending flywheel turning.  “What’s really interesting is the way you can democratize prime finance, so you don't need an introducing broker,” Cagney said. “You just attach your wallet to the exchange and trade. I don't need Robinhood, I don't need Schwab, I don't need TD [Ameritrade], and the whole prime system. What you ultimately end up with is a total reshaping of the way that financial markets work in a massively disruptive but extremely creative way to everyone in the ecosystem.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/04/02/crypto-exchange-figure-markets-has-a-plan-to-democratize-finance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6457911ad9e5822148623be10e3fa45ca6c78f52-1252x704.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Restaking and liquid restaking tokens could pose additional risks compared to existing staking products.  Restaking champions the open innovation of Ethereum and will become a core part of the ecosystem’s infrastructure, Coinbase said.  Restaking has grown into the second largest decentralized finance (DeFi) sector on the Ethereum blockchain and promises to be a core part of the ecosystem’s infrastructure, but it could bring hidden risks, Coinbase (COIN) said in a research report on Tuesday.  “EigenLayer’s staking protocol is poised to become the bedrock for a wide range of new services and middleware on Ethereum, which, in turn, could generate a meaningful source of ether {{ETH}} rewards for validators in the future,” analysts David Han and David Duong wrote, noting that it is now the second largest DeFi protocol with $12.4 billion in total value locked.  EigenLayer allows validators to earn extra rewards by securing actively validated services (AVS) by restaking their staked ether and “builds upon the foundation of the existing staking ecosystem by collateralizing a diverse pool of underlying liquid staked tokens (LSTs) or native staked ETH,” the report said.  Liquid restaking platforms park assets with EigenLayer and give their users tradable receipts called liquid restaking tokens (LRTs). Restaking and LRTs, however, could pose added risks compared to existing staking products, both from a financial and security perspective, Coinbase said.  Read more: Liquid Restaking Tokens: What Are They and Why Do They Matter?  “The adoption of LRT wrappers around the underlying protocol could lead to hidden risks from nontransparent staking strategies or temporary dislocations from their underlying,” the authors wrote, adding that the “initial yield from AVSs may not live up to the extremely high expectations set by the market.”  The report also pointed out that stakers will go where the LRT providers offer the highest rewards. This could lead to additional risks as these providers will try to maximize rewards by restaking multiple times to attract more users. ""We believe what matters will be the risk-adjusted rewards and not absolute rewards, but it may be difficult to have transparency on that. This could lead to additional risks as LRT DAOs are incentivized to maximally restake multiple times to remain competitive.""  However, Coinbase says despite these risks, “restaking champions the open innovation of Ethereum and will become a core part of the ecosystem’s infrastructure.”  Read more: Ethereum’s Rising Validator Count is Causing Concerns, Fidelity Digital Assets Says",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | RESEARCH,Will Canny,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/04/02/ethereum-could-face-hidden-risks-from-ballooning-restaking-market-coinbase,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5be80b30f22359c793cfd0f67f7dbf3a7879a940-1496x842.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Social Volume For Terms Related To Buy The Dip Has Shot Up According to data from the analytics firm Santiment, Bitcoin investors have more heavily reacted with bullish calls than bearish ones despite the sharp decline the asset has observed. The indicator of relevance here is the “Social Volume,” which tells us about the amount of discussion a given topic or term is receiving on the major social media platforms right now. Related Reading: Start Selling Bitcoin When This Happens, This Quant Says This metric works by going through the various posts/threads/messages on these websites to check for mentions of the topic. The indicator, however, doesn’t outright count up these mentions but rather the number of posts that contain at least one mention. This is naturally due to the fact that a high mention count alone can’t be a reliable indication of whether social media users as a whole are talking about the topic, since talk being limited to just a few threads can also lead to a spike in this count. In the context of the current discussion, Santiment has filtered the Social Volume for bullish and bearish keywords to find how the two sentiments compare currently. The below chart shows the trend in the metric for these terms since the start of the year 2024: The value of the metric appears to have been quite high in recent days | Source: Santiment on X For pinpointing bullish sentiment, the analytics firm has made use of terms such as “buy” or “bullish.” Similarly, “sell” or “bearish” are among the keywords for the opposite sentiment. From the graph, it’s visible that the Social Volume for the former type of terms has exploded following the latest plunge in the Bitcoin price, suggesting that social media users are looking at the drawdown as an opportunity to buy more. The bearish Social Volume has also seen an uplift, but its peak has only been half as high as one of the bullish terms. While the investors being bullish may sound optimistic at first, the fact is that this has actually not been ideal for rebounds to take place in the past. Related Reading: Traders Not Showing Dogecoin FOMO, Good Sign For Rally? As Santiment notes: Historically, the best dip buy opportunities occur when the crowd consensus is showing a bit of fear toward a further drop. This usually results in small wallets dropping their bags for whales and sharks to scoop them up. As such, the current market enthusiasm may actually be counterproductive for the chances of a bottom to form. According to the analytics firm, the real “buy the dip” for Bitcoin opportunity may present itself once the red sentiment has caught up to the blue one.

42418525,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThVk5,1712067692,Telegram's Pivot to TON Payments for Ads Boosts Toncoin,"Telegram's decision to dump the euro in favor of toncoin is paying dividends to TON investors.  The circular advertising economy could fuel more growth for the TON blockchain ecosystem.  Telegram's embrace of crypto technology – namely, the closely-linked TON blockchain – accelerated Sunday with the roll-out of toncoin (TON) payments for advertisers and crypto payouts for content creators on the messaging app.  The release has triggered an explosion of activity on The Open Network (better known as the TON Blockchain), which has now become Telegram's exclusive home for facilitating an entire social media advertising economy.  A record 156,000 TON wallets were activated on Sunday, when Telegram officially began accepting toncoins as payments for advertisements, according to TONstat.com. That figure more than doubles the network's previous onboarding record, set only one day before.  Though early, the figures suggest Telegram's experimental embrace of crypto is so far succeeding and, in doing so, has created a circular economy for TON. Advertisers must pay for their marketing campaigns in the cryptocurrency. That revenue then is split evenly between content creators (who can cash it out or reinvest it in their own ads) and Telegram itself (which has said it plans to hoard as much TON as it can and sell the rest to ""long-term investors"").  ""Telegram building its ad platform natively on TON, fueled by Toncoins, will drive adoption and add a strong utility to the ecosystem,"" said Alex Cassasovici, CEO of crypto-streaming project Azarus.  Anticipation of the ad program has already helped boost TON's value tremendously. It's climbed 150% in the month since Telegram CEO Pavel Durov announced the messaging app's plans to run its ad and revenue-sharing program using TON.  Telegram, too, stands to benefit from the program. Though Telegram has never before been profitable, it could now generate revenue from hosting tailored ads. With 700 million monthly active users and 1 trillion channel views per month it has a large base of eyeballs to draw from.  In March, the company raised $330 million in a bond sale that Durov said would accelerate Telegram's growth. ""The increased demand for our bonds shows that global financial institutions value Telegram’s growth in audience and monetization,"" he said in his own Telegram channel.  TON over EURO  A CoinDesk review of Telegram's TON-based ad platform revealed it is far more accessible and cheaper than Telegram's previous foray into hosted marketing. Advertisers need only 20 TON (~$105) to seed their campaigns through Telegram's crypto platform, Fragment. Previously, advertisers needed at least €2 million to run an official campaign through Telegram.  That lofty minimum was meant to ""ensure and maintain a high quality"" of advertisements, Telegram previously told its advertisers. Instead, it had the unintended consequence of pushing small-time advertisers toward agencies who had already spent €2 million, according to Van Morozov, a Serbia-based Telegram marketer at the consulting firm Bespalov Finance. Those agencies would then run marketing campaigns on behalf of many clients, he said.  Telegram is now positioned to reclaim the small-timers' business in a completely different payment medium than EURO, which it appears to have abandoned entirely. Instead, it chose TON, a cryptocurrency that can be transacted almost instantaneously, globally, outside the banking networks, and for little commission.  Revenue sharing  Telegram channel operators can expect to get a payday under the new ad program. According to Durov, administrators will be able to collect 50% of the revenue generated by ads run on their channels, with Telegram itself collecting the other half.  The plan vaults Telegram into the conversation surrounding social media companies' responsibilities toward their content creators. Many companies have taken to rewarding their power users with a slice of the revenue their posts create. However, few companies have publicly shared the breakdown, let alone committed to going half on the winnings.  While ad buying can start immediately, content creators and channel operators will not be able to withdraw any TON payments they receive until late May, according to a web page on Fragment.  A Ton of TON  Telegram's embrace of TON payments brings the network close to realizing part of a crypto vision that U.S. regulators have already tried to squash. From 2018 through 2020, it tried to raise cash by selling its own TON token to ICO investors, though it abandoned that plan in a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  The new TON token and blockchain isn't actually issued by Telegram. Instead, it's a recreation of the network that Telegram abandoned, which has been put together by a separate group called the TON Foundation.  While technically an arms-length affair, the ad payments setup could result in Telegram ""holding an unhealthy share of Toncoin, which will be too concentrated for a decentralized ecosystem,"" Durov said in a post to his own channel.  ""To limit Telegram’s share of TON at ≈10% of the supply, we’ll be selling the upcoming surplus of our TON holdings to long-term investors — under 1-4 years lockup and vesting plan, but at a discount to the market price. This way free-floating TON will get locked up, stabilizing the ecosystem and reducing volatility,"" he said in his post.  Morozov, the Telegram marketer, said the TON ecosystem has gone parabolic from late 2023 through today. New wallets are coming online daily as more people plug into a growing ecosystem of services, games and advertising platforms.  “The TON community is bigger than ever now,"" he said in a message on Telegram.",POSITIVE,TON,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TON,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/04/02/telegrams-pivot-to-ton-payments-for-ads-boosts-toncoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a2be8a4b93c3e8682b9fd7520f951e5e931915ad-4800x2700.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

One Final All-Time High For Bitcoin Before Halving The price of Bitcoin is presently exhibiting new bearish activity, which might trigger negative sentiments in the market over the next few days. Despite the notable decline, Michael Van De Poppe is optimistic that BTC will attain a new height prior to Bitcoin Halving expected to occur this month’s end. Related Reading: Bitcoin Halving Inches Closer With Less Than 2,900 Blocks Left According to the analyst, the digital asset is currently in a consolidation zone. He further identified two distinct crucial levels within the lower timeframes such as the $67,000 threshold as a support level and the $71,700 mark as a final break out towards the peak. It is worth noting that Michael Van De Poppe previously forecasted that Tuesday is probably when the real moves are expected to begin as Bitcoin consolidates. Thus, if the coin holds the $67,000 level, he will propose a one-last peak test ahead of the halving. Poppe seems to be confident about his prediction now as he asserts that if one of the two aforementioned crucial levels develops, it will determine the direction of Bitcoin. Due to this, he believes BTC will experience one final pre-halving all-time high. The post read: Bitcoin is calmly consolidating. Crucial levels (lower timeframes): $67,000 to hold for support, $71,700 for a final breakout towards the ATH. If either of the two happens, probably direction is chosen. I think we will have one final ATH test before halving happens. Following the recent decline, Poppe has issued a warning to the crypto community on how to interact with the price action. “You do not want to chase those massive green candles,” he stated. He advocates entering the market when BTC‘s price is down by 15% to 40%. Additionally, he addressed those considering investing in altcoins, urging them to invest when altcoins are down by 25% to 60%. Possible Triggers For The Correction As of press time, Bitcoin’s price is trading at $65,843, demonstrating a decline of over 5% in the daily timeframe. Its trading volume has seen a significant uptick of 66% in the past day, while its market cap has decreased by 5%. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETF Inflows Could Eclipse $1 Trillion, Predicts Bitwise CIO Since its peak of $73,000, achieved in early March, the price of Bitcoin has dropped by nearly 10%.

Data from Wu Blockchain revealed that the products saw an overall net outflow of $85.84 million on Monday. BlackRock ETF IBIT recorded a net inflow of $165 million, while Grayscale ETF GBTC experienced a single-day net outflow of $302 million.

42418509,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThVWf,1712065609,How the Bitcoin Halving Could Affect Network Security,"In addition to price concerns, questions about network security in a post-halving world remain unanswered.  There are potential security risks due to the possibility of smaller miners withdrawing from the market as rewards are halved, leading to reduced hash rates and overall security.  It is estimated that 51% of the hashing power within the protocol architecture may be vulnerable to attacks.  However, previous halving events have had minimal impact on overall network security, and many analysts predict a smooth transition for the network itself.  The upcoming Bitcoin halving is the network’s most anticipated halving yet. The halving, a programmed reduction in the block reward miners receive for validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain, is set to significantly impact the bitcoin {{BTC}} mining industry.  This feature is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package published to coincide with the fourth Bitcoin “halving” in April 2024.  Meltem Erdem is CoinDesk Turkey's cybersecurity columnist.  The bitcoin mining industry is extremely competitive, with miners sometimes operating on razor thin margins. Scheduled to occur next month, around April 15, this halving will see the current reward of 6.25 bitcoins per block reduced to 3.125 bitcoins. What impact will this have on the mining industry?  Is the mining industry well-positioned for reduced block rewards?  The halving, which occurs approximately every four years, reduces the rate at which new bitcoins are created, thus enforcing scarcity and potentially driving up the cryptocurrency’s value. However, for miners, this means an immediate halving of revenue from mined blocks, assuming the price of bitcoin does not increase proportionately.  This could lead to increased financial strain on less efficient mining operations, even forcing some out of business, which could cause a temporary contraction in the network’s hashing power.  See also: Bitcoin Halving, Explained  The reduced block reward also has implications for Bitcoin’s network security. The security of the Bitcoin network relies on a decentralized global network of miners competing to validate transactions and secure the blockchain. The mining process, which consumes substantial computational power, is incentivized by the block reward plus transaction fees. A reduction in the block reward means that, without a compensatory rise in bitcoin’s price or transaction fees, miners could earn less for their efforts, which might reduce the incentive to mine.  If a large number of miners leave the network, it could substantially weaken network security, potentially making the network more vulnerable to attacks, at least in the short term, until difficulty adjustments occur.  Are the security protocols for halving configured correctly?  The reduction of the current block reward to 3.125 bitcoins from the current 6.25 bitcoins is a deflationary feature that contributes to bitcoin’s value proposition and scarcity. Though it also introduces challenges for miners.  In the same way that mining pools and companies have added new machines in anticipation of the event, thereby speeding up the the creation of new blocks, the same could happen in reverse as miners power down if their revenues drop.  If a significant number of miners turn off their machines due to reduced profitability, the total computational power securing the network, known as the hash rate, could decrease. A lower hash rate means the network is less secure and more vulnerable to certain types of attacks, such as the 51% attack, where a bad actor could potentially gain control over the majority of the hash rate to manipulate the blockchain.  Further, in a scenario where the hash rate drops significantly and miners prioritize high-fee transactions, the Bitcoin network could experience slower transaction processing times. This slowdown could impact the usability of Bitcoin, especially in cases where timely transaction settlement is critical.  A significant and prolonged decrease in the hash rate is unlikely, as the Bitcoin protocol includes difficulty adjustments to ensure new blocks are produced approximately every 10 minutes. However, a lower hash rate could still temporarily increase the network’s vulnerability to attacks, potentially undermining trust in the Bitcoin network’s security, its price and adoption rate.  It’s worth noting that, historically, Bitcoin has shown resilience in the face of halving events, with the price often increasing in the months following a halving, which can alleviate some of the potential negative impacts on miners. However, the dynamics around each halving can vary based on broader market conditions and technological factors, this halving is very different from the prior three.  Can we expect any beneficial outcomes the mining industry?  The best-case scenario for the mining industry following a Bitcoin halving centers around a series of positive outcomes that not only mitigate the challenges associated with reduced block rewards but also enhance the overall strength and resilience of the Bitcoin network. The most significant positive outcome would be a substantial increase in the price of bitcoin.  See also: The Bitcoin Halving Really Is Different This Time  As block rewards diminish, transaction fees will become a more significant part of miners’ revenue. The best-case scenario would see a balanced increase in transaction fees that compensates for the reduced block reward without deterring users due to high costs. This could occur through a combination of increased Bitcoin adoption, more transactions per block through efficiency improvements, new use case like Ordinals, and layer 2 solutions like the Lightning Network driving Bitcoin’s utility and demand for on-chain settlement.  Despite the reduced block reward, the hash rate remains stable or even increases due to higher Bitcoin prices and more efficient mining operations. Currently, Bitcoin’s hash rate has been reaching all time highs, which demonstrates that miners are not deterred by the upcoming block reward reduction. A stable or growing hash rate ensures the network’s security against attacks, maintaining trust in Bitcoin’s robustness as a decentralized financial system.  Increased recognition of Bitcoin as a valuable digital asset by institutional investors could drive demand and stabilize the market. Institutional investment would not only support higher bitcoin prices but could also lead to more innovative financial products and services built around bitcoin, further integrating it into the global financial system. The recent launch of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S. are one such example of the impact of institutional adoption on the demand for bitcoin.  The Bitcoin network continues to grow in terms of security, adoption and technological innovation, reinforcing its position as the leading cryptocurrency. The mining industry, while preparing for the upcoming adjustment to the new economics post-halving, remains profitable and sustainable, driving further innovation and investment in the sector.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Meltem Erdem,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/04/02/how-the-bitcoin-halving-could-affect-network-security,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/958e2406a45d227bbdeb1d9bc52c966313c3cd64-2560x1440.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The magnitude of the purchase has caused the crypto community to speculate on why Bitcoin’s price has dipped instead when such a development is usually bullish for the crypto token. Tether Acquires 8,888 BTC Data from the blockchain analysis platform Arkham Intelligence shows that Tether acquired 8,888 Bitcoin on March 31, and the stablecoin issuer now holds almost 75,400 BTC. With its BTC holding, Tether now ranks as one of the largest Bitcoin holders, even having more BTC than some of the most prominent crypto exchanges and Spot Bitcoin ETF issuers. Last year, the stablecoin issuer announced its plan to regularly purchase Bitcoin for its stablecoin reserves using part of the profits realized from its operations. Therefore, it is no surprise that the company has been able to acquire this amount of BTC since then, especially with the success they have attained recently. However, what is surprising is that Bitcoin has since dropped below $70,000 following this development. Usually, a Bitcoin purchase of such size should positively impact Bitcoin’s price and not cause a price dip like the one currently experienced. However, there is reason to believe other factors have overshadowed Tether’s purchase and caused Bitcoin to see such a sharp correction. Why The Bitcoin Price Is Down Crypto trading firm QCP Capital recently provided insights into why Bitcoin’s price broke below $70,000 and dropped to as low as $66,000. The firm claimed that the sharp move to the downside was due to the “large liquidations on retail-heavy exchanges like Binance, which saw perp funding rates go from as high as 77% to flat.” Related Reading: Shiba Inu Dips Below $0.00003 Again – Can Bulls Reverse The Bullish Momentum? The Spot Bitcoin ETFs, specifically Grayscale’s GBTC, also look to have contributed to Bitcoin’s decline as Grayscale continues to experience significant outflows from its fund. On April 1, GBTC saw an outflow of $302.6 million, mainly contributing to the combined net outflows of $85.7 million recorded by these Bitcoin ETFs.This has brought about more selling pressure on Bitcoin, which is currently overwhelming the buying pressure in the ecosystem. Activity in the derivatives market has also played a part in the bearish market sentiment, with the bears looking firmly in control. Data from Coinglass shows that $409 million has been liquidated from the market in the last 24 hours, with $328 million in long positions being wiped out during this period. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $66,500, down over 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42418505,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThVSX,1712059724,"DeFi Protocol Cega's New Options Product Marries Gold, Ether to Offer Up to 83% Yield","The decentralized derivatives protocol unveiled a high-yield structured product called Gold Rush last week.  The basket options strategy involves Tether's gold-backed token, XAUT, and ether as underlying assets and a safety component that protects users from a 30% drop in the tokens' prices.  Decentralized finance (DeFi) projects are continuing to develop structured products, which offer decent returns, market exposure and protection from losses and were previously available only to institutional investors in traditional markets.  Last week, derivatives protocol Cega unveiled Gold Rush, a basket options strategy involving the Ethereum blockchain's ether {{ETH}} token and Tether's gold-backed {{XAUT}} as underlying assets alongside a safety component that protects users' capital from a 30% drop in the assets' prices.  The product offers an annualized percentage yield of up to 83% to investors who stake ETH, Lido's staked ether (stETH), wrapped bitcoin (wBTC), or stablecoin USDC in the option strategy vault, Cega said. The yield is paid out in the form of the coins staked, so, ETH stakers receive ETH in yield, providing an asymmetric upside in a bullish market.  The Gold Rush vault went live on March 26. Since then, users have deposited crypto assets worth $2.74 million in the strategy.  ""Users in DeFi want to stake native assets like ETH or liquid staking tokens like stETH, but don’t want to lose the asymmetric upside on those assets. Users also want safer, higher-yielding opportunities without significant risk to their principal. The new offering, Gold Rush, achieves both of these goals,"" Cega told CoinDesk.  Knock-in safety feature  Gold Rush sells 27-day put options with XAUT and ETH as underlying assets. The premium received from market makers who purchase these options is distributed as yield to vault participants.  Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date. A call gives the right to buy and a put gives the right to sell. A basket option gives the option holder the right to buy or sell the basket of underlying assets, in Cega's case, ETH and XAUT, at a preset price at a later date.  The option has a safety mechanism that protects stakers' capital against a 30% price drop in XAUT or ETH and has a maturity of 27 days. In other words, the product is suitable for those who do not expect the tokens to drop by more than that over the period.  If neither of the assets drop that much, users receive the principal in full, along with the yield, which is accrued daily. On the flip side, if either does breach the 30% downside barrier, the principal returned on expiry is adjusted for the loss from the worst-performing asset. The user still retains the yield.  ""Users receive downside protection on their deposits against significant market declines, up to 30%. This safety element is an attractive aspect of the fixed coupon note strategy (FCN) owing to a technical feature called a barrier option,"" Cega said in a note to CoinDesk.  According to Cega, even in the worst-case scenario, users earn more than they would from holding long XAUT/USD or ETH/USD positions.  ""This is because losses are offset by the high daily yield, which is paid regardless of market conditions – and this safety feature also makes FCNs [fixed coupon notes/structured products] attractive for investors,"" Cega said in an explainer.  Cega's backtesting of the strategy over the past three years showed less than a 3% chance of XAUT or ETH falling by over 30% in 27 days.  That said, depositors stand to lose the yield if the market makers who purchased options default. And, as with other DeFi protocols, moving funds on-chain carries a smart contract risk.  12:25 UTC: Correction: Users have deposited crypto assets worth $2.74 million in the strategy.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin (BTC) faced selling pressure early Tuesday as the cryptocurrency’s reward halving approaches. The leading cryptocurrency by market value fell 5.7% to $65,742 in a bearish resolution of the recent week-long consolidation between $68,000 and $72,000. Bitcoin’s halving event is approaching this month, expected on April 21. The event reduces the pace of BTC production by 50%. Some analysts say the event has already been well telegraphed by the market, limiting any major reaction. “As we come into this halving event, bitcoin has just put in a fresh record high and could be less inclined to be wanting to extend its record run before first going through an overdue period of correction and consolidation,” said LMAX Digital in a morning note. The broader crypto market also nursed losses, with ether (ETH), Solana's SOL and dogecoin (DOGE) registering larger drops. The broader CoinDesk 20 index fell nearly 8%.  Ethena Labs, the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that offers the $1.3 billion yield-earning USDe, has opened claims for its new governance token, ENA. In a post on X on Tuesday, Ethena invited holders of USDe to claim their share of the airdrop of 750 million ENA tokens – 5% of the total supply – which is set to list on centralized exchanges. Following the commencement of the airdrop, ENA rose over 8% to trade at around 64 cents, with a market cap of close to $500 million, according to data by CoinGecko.  Deribit, the world’s leading crypto options exchange, said on Tuesday that its Dubai-based unit, Deribit FZE, has won a conditional virtual asset provider (VASP) license from the local regulator. The license allowing FZE to operate as a virtual asset exchange for spot and derivatives trading remains nonoperational until Deribit satisfies all remaining conditions and local requirements of Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA), Deribit said in the press release. Once operational, it will allow Deribit to serve institutional and qualified investors while continuing to serve retail investors through its Panama-based broker affiliate.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the list of layer-1 and layer-2 blockchain projects by analyzing smart contracts, the number of unique active wallets (UAW), decentralized applications and other metrics.

25122543,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=600954,1712059212,Solana Price Could Explode By 80% If This Happens: Crypto Analyst,"In line with the broader trend in the overall crypto market, the Solana (SOL) price has fallen by 7.5% in the last 24 hours. However, according to renowned analyst Rekt Capital, there is no reason to switch to the bearish side. In a recent technical analysis, the crypto analyst highlighted that Solana is currently showing potential for an 80% price rally based on its present consolidation pattern. According to Rekt Capital, Solana is trading within what appears to be a bull flag formation, as depicted on the weekly SOL/USD chart from Binance. A Bull Flag pattern occurs after a strong, almost vertical price rise and is characterized by a downward-sloping consolidation that resembles a flag on a pole. The “pole” is formed by the initial price surge, while the “flag” represents a period of consolidation with converging trendlines. Traders often watch for a decisive breakout above the flag, which can signal the continuation of the prior uptrend. In Solana’s case, the analyst points out that Solana recently faced a rejection at the top of the bull flag pattern at $208, indicating a short-term setback in its upward trajectory. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Continues To Soar – How High Can It Go? “And if Solana keeps this up, it may form a Bull Flag here before breaking out to challenge that Range High $208 resistance again,” Rekt Capital noted. However, the bottom of this bull flag, which stands at approximately $184, is identified as a critical support level that needs to be maintained to keep the bullish momentum alive. Should Solana manage to hold above this level, the setup may favor the continuation of the uptrend. Notably, Rekt Capital adds that while occasional dips or “wicks” into the $173 range are acceptable, the price must generally remain above the $184 support on the weekly time frame to validate the bullish outlook. The $173 price level is marked by a blue horizontal line on the chart, serving as an additional support zone. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Breaks Through Key Resistance, Analyst Forecasts $250 Price Target In terms of price targets, the chart reveals an 80.57% potential rally from the bottom of the bull flag (“pole flag”), which could translate into a target price of approximately $330 if the bull flag pattern is confirmed in the coming days or weeks. Solana Bears Gain The Upper Hand On The Lower Time Frames On the lower time frames, like the 2-hour chart, the Solana price lost some momentum, indicating potential short-term consolidation or downward movement. SOL experienced a sharp -13% decline, breaking through a significant upward trendline (black) that had previously provided support throughout an ascending trajectory. The price has sliced through the Fibonacci retracement levels plotted from the swing low at $162.68 to the swing high at $204.19, currently hovering around the 0.618 Fib level at $178.54. Typically, this level serves as a strong support zone, but a sustained break below could accelerate losses toward the next levels at 0.786 ($171.56) and potentially the full retracement at $162.68. Volume indicators show a marked increase in selling pressure during the price dip, which substantiates the current bearish momentum. Furthermore, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has plummeted to 29, teetering on the edge of the oversold territory. This suggests that sellers are in control, but also raises the possibility of a relief bounce if the RSI dips further into oversold conditions and triggers a reactive buying response.

Digital asset investment products recorded inflows of $862 million last week following outflows of nearly $1 billion the week before, according to alternative asset manager CoinShares.  The trend was led by U.S.-based funds, which saw $897 million of inflows, while Europe and Canada witnessed a combined $49 million of outflows.  The recovery from the week before, which saw outflows of $931 million, coincided with a recovery in BTC's price which sat at just under $70,000 on March 29, up nearly 10% on a week earlier.  The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), which provides a weighted performance of the digital asset market, rose around 8.6% during the same period. BTC has however started this week in the red, currently down nearly 6% in the last 24 hours, sitting just below $65,500. CD20 meanwhile has declined 7.28%.  BTC-related inflows totaled $865 million throughout the week, according to CoinShares' data.

Spot bitcoin ETFs offer the same investor protections as equities and reduce the incentive to move to unregulated offshore exchanges.  There has also been a push for better regulatory frameworks and self-regulatory practices within the industry, Galaxy said.  The cryptocurrency market has changed since the collapse of FTX and the conditions that enabled the rise of the exchange’s founder and former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, no longer hold, financial services firm Galaxy Digital (GLXY) said in a research report on Friday.  New exchanges have emerged that allow users to self-custody their cryptocurrencies, and these platforms have been designed to “address the lack of custody and transparency that contributed to the FTX collapse by ensuring users maintain direct control over their digital assets,” analyst Lucas Tcheyan wrote.  Exchanges that don’t provide self-custody have started publishing proof of reserve audits as evidence they possess the client assets they claim to, the report said.  Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison last week after being found guilty on seven fraud and conspiracy charges related to FTX's collapse.  The launch of spot bitcoin {{BTC}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is also a game changer. In a “critical step forward, U.S. users finally have access to a regulated bitcoin ETF that affords them the same investor protections they’d get buying equities and further reduces their incentive to move to unregulated offshore exchanges,” Tcheyan wrote.  There has also been a push for better regulatory frameworks and self-regulatory practices within the cryptocurrency industry, Galaxy noted.  Despite these positive steps forward, the crypto market “remains fraught with challenges” and “priority must be placed on addressing and rectifying the harmful practices that have marred the industry’s reputation in the past,” the report added.

According to the latest data from CoinShares, Cardano-centric investment products witnessed a staggering $1.1 million influx over the past week, marking a notable reversal from the $3.7 million outflows recorded just a week prior. Related Reading: Investor Alert: Ethereum Q2 Potential Promises Double-Digit Gains – Analyst Cardano Sees Massive Inflows This sudden influx catapults Cardano to the forefront of investor interest in similar products, reflecting a growing prominence for the cryptocurrency within the crypto investment landscape. Despite experiencing a reduction in positions in March, fresh data suggests a positive trajectory for Cardano by the end of the month, hinting at resilience amidst market fluctuations. A recovery for Bitcoin ETFs, with US$862m inflows last week pic.twitter.com/D1OWUSdGIU — James Butterfill (@jbutterfill) April 1, 2024 The resurgence of investor interest in Bitcoin ETFs has also contributed to a broader increase in crypto investment activity, with total crypto investment inflows since the beginning of the year surpassing $13 billion. Bitcoin ETFs absorbed the majority of these inflows, totaling $12 billion, indicating robust investor confidence in the leading cryptocurrency. Source: Coinshares Amidst these developments, speculation looms regarding the possibility of a Cardano ETF. While Cardano’s ability to attract investment amid a competitive market landscape underscores its growing prominence, the prospect of a Cardano ETF remains speculative, particularly given the ongoing situation with Ethereum. However, as capital continues to flow into ADA-oriented investment products, Cardano’s position on the financial markets is likely to strengthen, positioning it as a notable contender in the ongoing crypto ETF boom. ADA market cap currently at $21 billion. Chart: TradingView.com ADA Tells A Different Narrative Despite the positive inflows, concerns linger over Cardano’s recent performance compared to other assets. ADA has seen sluggish performance, with losses of 3.50% and only 6.40% gains year-to-date, according to CoinMarketCap. Analysis reveals a drop in the percentage of ADA’s total supply in profit, from 80% to 75%, indicating a trend of selling activity and raising concerns about ADA’s trajectory amidst bullish market trends. Related Reading: XRP And XLM Blast: Analyst’s 20X Rally Projection To ‘Melt Faces’ Furthermore, there’s a notable decrease in the number of wallets holding substantial amounts of ADA, signaling a shift in investor behavior. This decrease could potentially reflect a lack of confidence in ADA’s future prospects or a desire among investors to reallocate their assets to other cryptocurrencies or investment vehicles. The juxtaposition of increased investor interest and concerns over performance paints a nuanced picture of Cardano’s current standing in the cryptocurrency market. While the surge in inflows highlights growing investor confidence and recognition of Cardano’s potential, the challenges posed by sluggish performance and shifting investor sentiments underscore the need for vigilance among ADA investors.

The March 2023 case pertains to allegations of selling and airdropping unregistered securities, fraud and market manipulation.  The TRON Foundation and Tron founder Justin Sun asked a New York court to dismiss a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), saying the regulator failed to establish that the court has jurisdiction over the foreign defendants, a March 28 filing shows.  ""The SEC is not a worldwide regulator,"" the memo to the District Court of the Southern District of New York said. ""Its efforts to leverage highly attenuated contacts to the United States, to extend U.S. securities laws to cover predominantly foreign conduct, go too far and should be rejected.""  The case pertains to allegations of selling and airdropping unregistered securities, fraud and market manipulation that the SEC brought in March 2023. At the time, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said ""Sun and his companies not only targeted U.S. investors ... but they also coordinated wash trading on an unregistered trading platform ... ""  The defendants – Sun, Tron Foundation, BitTorrent Foundation and Rainberry – argued that ""even if it could be shown that the exercise of personal jurisdiction over the foreign defendants is appropriate here, the claims still fail for myriad, equally powerful reasons.""  California-registered Rainberry did not contest the court's jurisdiction, instead asking for dismissal for other reasons, including that the defendants did not receive fair notice.  ""There was no fair notice that the SEC would attempt to pursue claims like those alleged here – reaching global contests and giveaways, free airdrops, and secondary trading in tokens (issued overseas, years earlier) on a developing blockchain, with few specific ties to the United States,"" the filing said.  Another reason cited is that the action was premature under the major questions doctrine – a legal precedent that is meant to curb government overreach, implying that Congress writes the rules that agencies like the SEC are meant to follow.  "" ... the SEC’s unprecedented, novel expansion of its regulatory power to the global digital asset market is also a 'transformative expansion' of its regulatory authority in the absence of 'clear congressional authorization,' presenting a novel issue under the major questions doctrine and warranting dismissal,"" the filing said.

25116579,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=600905,1712047803,"Bitcoin Price Tumbles Below $66,000: 4 Major Reasons","The Bitcoin market has witnessed a significant downturn, with prices plummeting below the $66,000 mark. This abrupt -5.6% price movement can be attributed to four major factors: a long liquidation event, a rising US Dollar Index (DXY), profit-taking by investors, and spot Bitcoin ETF outflows. #1 Long Liquidations The main force leading to today’s downturn in Bitcoin’s price was a significant deleveraging event characterized by an unusually high level of long liquidations. Before the downturn, Bitcoin’s Open Interest (OI) Weighted Funding Rate was unusually high, indicating that leveraged traders were paying premiums to maintain long positions in anticipation of future price increases. This optimism, however, made the market vulnerable to sudden corrections. Related Reading: Hedge Fund Manager Predicts When Bitcoin Price Will Reach $150,000 Crypto analyst Ted, known as @tedtalksmacro on X (formerly Twitter), remarked, “Today was the largest long liquidation event since the 19th March.” He further elaborated on the effects of this correction by noting, “Nice reset in overall positioning today, even on just a 5% drop lower for Bitcoin… Next leg higher is loading I think.” This comment highlights the severity of the liquidations and suggests a potential rebound or restructuring within the market as it stabilizes. Coinglass data reveals that over the last 24 hours, 120,569 traders were liquidated, amounting to $395.53 million in total liquidations, with $311.97 million being long positions. Bitcoin-specific long liquidations were at $87.42 million. #2 DXY Puts Pressure On Bitcoin With 105.037, the DXY closed at its highest level since November yesterday, evidencing a strengthening US dollar. Given Bitcoin’s inverse correlation with the DXY, the stronger dollar might have shifted investor preference towards safer assets, moving away from riskier investments like Bitcoin. This correlation stems from the global market’s risk sentiment, where a rising DXY often signals a shift towards safer investments, detracting from riskier assets like Bitcoin. However, analyst Coosh Alemzadeh provided a counter perspective, suggesting through a Wyckoff redistribution schema that despite the DXY’s recent uptick, the next move could favor risk assets, potentially including Bitcoin. #DXY ⬆️4 weeks in a row/broke out of its downtrend so consensus is that a new uptrend is starting yet risk assets are consolidating at ATH Next move ⬆️in risk assets on deck IMO pic.twitter.com/u6ORa76vkj — “Coosh” Alemzadeh (@AlemzadehC) April 2, 2024 #3 Profit Taking By Investors Profit-taking by investors has also played a significant role in the recent price adjustments. The Bitcoin on-chain analysis platform Checkonchain reported a spike in profit-taking activities. Related Reading: Start Selling Bitcoin When This Happens, This Quant Says Glassnode’s lead on-chain analyst, Checkmatey, shared insights via X, stating, “The classic Bitcoin MVRV Ratio hits conditions we characterize as ‘heated, but not yet overcooked’. MVRV = above +0.5sd but below +1sd. This indicates that the average BTC holder is sitting on a significant unrealized profit, prompting an uptick in spending.” The profit-taking coincided with Bitcoin reaching a peak of $73,000, marking a cycle high in profit realization with over 352,000 BTC sold for profit. This selling behavior is typical in bull markets but plays a crucial role in creating resistance levels at local price tops. #4 Bitcoin ETF Outflows Lastly, the market witnessed notable outflows from Bitcoin ETFs, marking a reversal from last week’s substantial inflows. The total outflows amounted to $85.7 million in a single day, with Grayscale’s GBTC experiencing the most significant withdrawal of $302 million. Meanwhile, Blackrock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC reported positive inflows, totaling $165.9 million and $44 million, respectively. Commenting on this, WhalePanda remarked, “Overall negative day but not as negative as the price implied. Closing of Q1 so taking profit here makes sense. Some fuckery around [the] new quarter and halving is to be expected.” At press time, BTC traded at $66,647.

42418511,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThVXh,1712047009,Crypto Market Setup Looks Positive for Second Quarter: Coinbase,"The bitcoin halving, expected in mid-April, is the standout supply-side event.  Wirehouses may be close to approving spot bitcoin ETFs, the report said.  Institutional interest in the crypto space remains elevated, according to Coinbase.  The crypto market is set up for a positive second quarter with most of the previously identified headwinds in the rear-view mirror, Coinbase (COIN) said in a research report on Friday.  These positive factors may ""only manifest themselves more clearly starting in the second half of April,"" Coinbase said.  The bitcoin {{BTC}} reward halving, expected April 16-20, remains the main supply-side event, the report said. The quadrennial halving is when miner rewards are slashed by 50%, thereby reducing the rate of growth in bitcoin supply.  ""On the demand side, the 90-day review period that many wirehouses employ when conducting due diligence on new financial offerings – like spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) – could conclude as early as April 10,"" analysts David Duong and David Han wrote.  Coinbase notes that wirehouses such as Morgan Stanley (MS), Bank of America (BAC), UBS (UBS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) are ""not the only gatekeepers of wealth"" and some major U.S. wealth-management platforms operate outside of these large financial institutions.  Three months is the normal observation period for some of these large money managers, such as LPL Financial, and Coinbase said this ""could yet unlock significant capital for U.S.-based spot bitcoin ETFs over the medium term.""  Institutional interest in the crypto space remains elevated, the report said, citing the level of leveraged short positions in Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) bitcoin futures, which climbed to a record high on March 19.  In another positive sign, the total value locked (TVL) in on-chain derivatives has reached an all time high of $3.4 billion, even as the broader decentralized finance (DeFi) TVL remains about 50% off its previous cycle highs, the report added.  Investors shorting shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR), the software developer that has made a strategic decision to buy BTC, versus long bitcoin may be contributing to some of the recent market volatility, Coinbase said.

The exchange is looking to shift its global headquarters from Panama to Dubai.  Deribit, the world’s leading crypto options exchange, said on Tuesday that its Dubai-based unit, Deribit FZE, has won a conditional virtual asset provider (VASP) license from the local regulator.  The license allowing FZE to operate as a virtual asset exchange for spot and derivatives trading remains nonoperational until Deribit satisfies all remaining conditions and local requirements of Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA), Deribit said in the press release.  The license, once operational, will allow Deribit to serve institutional and qualified investors while continuing to serve retail investors through its Panama-based broker affiliate.  The exchange also said it is looking to shift its global headquarters to Dubai from Panama and announced Luuk Strijers, who served as chief commercial officer since 2019, as the new chief executive officer.  “Obtaining the full VARA spot and derivatives license is an important next step in our efforts to raise the overall quality & governance standards of our platform after obtaining ISO and SOC2 certification and appointing non-executive directors.

A year ago, Dubai’s VARA unveiled a regulatory framework for crypto that included a set of rules and required companies to secure licenses to operate in the country legally.  The VASP license is mandatory and a prerequisite for conducting virtual asset business in Dubai.

Related Reading: XRP And XLM Blast: Analyst’s 20X Rally Projection To ‘Melt Faces’ Santiment’s recent analysis reveals that the number of Ethereum addresses holding coins has reached highs of more than 118,000, with midterm MVRV suggesting a mild bullish signal. These indicators, combined with past data indicating Ethereum’s tendency for robust performance during Q2, fuel hopes for another season of positive returns. Ethereum: Historically Strong Q2 Performance Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a screenshot of Ethereum’s quarterly returns on social media platform X, highlighting the cryptocurrency’s significant spikes during previous second quarters, notably in 2017 and 2019. These spikes, with increases of 450% and over 100% respectively, have intrigued investors and led them to closely monitor Ethereum’s performance in the current quarter. Q2 has historically been very bullish for $ETH! However, we must consider the high probability that the @SECGov will delay the approval of a spot #Ethereum ETF, which may cause turbulence in the market. pic.twitter.com/TlZ3KZhr4e — Ali (@ali_charts) April 1, 2024 Several key financial players, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale, have expressed interest in launching a spot Ethereum ETF. However, the regulatory hurdles present significant challenges, raising questions about Ethereum’s integration into traditional financial markets. Market indicators reflect Ethereum’s current state, with nearly 5% decline in the last 24 hours, trading at $3,380. Despite this dip, Ethereum briefly surpassed $3,500 over the weekend, showcasing resilience amidst market fluctuations. Ethereum price action in the last three months. Source: Coingecko While market indicators point towards a potentially bullish period for Ethereum, uncertainty looms over the regulatory landscape, casting a shadow of caution over investors’ optimism. The impending decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the approval or rejection of the spot Ethereum ETF by May 23 is eagerly anticipated. Analysts cautiously estimate a modest 25% likelihood of approval, acknowledging the regulatory complexities surrounding cryptocurrency investment vehicles. Ether market cap currently at $406 billion. Chart: TradingView.com ETF Approval: Boon For Ether? Approval of the ETF could herald a new era for Ethereum, opening the floodgates for increased institutional investment and potentially igniting heightened market demand. Institutional investors, previously hindered by regulatory uncertainties and limited investment avenues, would gain access to a regulated and transparent platform, thus bolstering Ethereum’s legitimacy within traditional finance. Such a development could fuel a surge in Ethereum’s market value, attracting both seasoned investors and newcomers alike.

The market, accustomed to swift movements and rapid changes, may experience a period of turbulence as investors reassess their strategies in light of regulatory setbacks. Ethereum’s second quarter outlook is marked by a delicate balance between historical performance patterns, regulatory uncertainties, and market dynamics.

The changes were passed in parliament in 2021 but Singapore’s central bank made the changes live only on Tuesday.  Singapore has expanded the scope of what cryptocurrency-related activities it regulates to include custodial services, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced on Tuesday.  The change in scope also includes cross-border money transfers even when the money is not accepted or received in the city-state, and the facilitation of the transmission of crypto between accounts and exchanges,  The legislation was passed in 2021 with amendments to the Payment Services Act (PS Act), the framework to regulate payment service providers. It was supposed to be enacted in the fourth quarter of 2021, but the MAS made the changes live only on Tuesday. Since 2021, the cryptocurrency sector has seen huge turmoil with the crash of FTX, leading to regulatory changes across the world.  “This is a long-awaited expansion that gives regulatory clarity to key parts of the crypto ecosystem, such as custody services,” said Angela Ang, a senior policy adviser for blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs and a former MAS regulator.  The amendments would impose user protection and financial stability-related requirements on digital payment tokens (DPT) or cryptocurrency service providers.  The amendments include “segregating customers’ assets and placing them in a trust account for the benefit of customers, maintaining proper books and records, and ensuring that effective systems and controls are in place” and will take effect within six months from April 4, 2024.  Any entity that is already conducting crypto-related activities under the Payment Services Act will need to start a transition process within 30 days and submit a license application within six months from April 4, 2024, to continue activities temporarily till their application is reviewed.  The license application will require an attestation report of compliance with requirements around anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism, qualified by an external auditor within nine months.  Entities that do not comply with these requirements would have to cease all activities, the MAS said.

Data released on Monday shows that U.S. manufacturing activity unexpectedly picked up the pace in March.  June Fed rate cut probability dipped below 50% after the manufacturing data.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} faced selling pressure during Asian trading hours on Tuesday as upbeat U.S. factory data lifted the dollar index (DXY) to the highest since mid-November.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value fell 4% to $66,342 in a bearish resolution of the recent week-long consolidation between $68,000 and $72,000, CoinDesk data show. The broader crypto market nursed losses, with ether {{ETH}}, Solana's SOL and Dogecoin {{DOGE}} registering more significant losses. Meanwhile, the broader CoinDesk 20 index fell nearly 8%.  The dollar index, which tracks the greenback’s value against major fiat currencies, topped the 105 mark for the first time over four months, taking the four-week gain to 2.58%. A stronger dollar makes dollar-denominated assets like bitcoin and gold expensive, potentially leading to lower demand. Besides, sustained dollar strength is known to cause financial tightening worldwide, denting investors’ willingness to take risks.  The Institute for Supply Management’s (ISM) manufacturing purchasing manager’s index (PMI) released Monday showed that factory activity unexpectedly expanded in March, the first growth since September 2022.  The PMI rose 2.5 points to 50.3 last month following February’s 47.8 reading. The headline figure crossed into expansion territory above 50, halting 16 straight months of contraction and weakening the case for Fed rate cuts. The new orders index also moved back into expansion territory and the prices index jumped to 55.8%, up 3.3 percentage points compared to the reading of 52.5% in February.  According to Bloomberg, the amount of Fed rate cuts priced into swap contracts for this year has declined to less than 65 basis points following the manufacturing report. In other words, the market now expects the Fed to walk back on its forecast of three 25-basis point rate cuts for 2024. The probability the Fed will deliver the first rate cut in June has dropped below 50%.  “Markets are focused on the ISM report, though, with 10Y Treasury yields up 10bp on the back of the return of manufacturing growth and higher inflation readings from the sector. There are 20 or so individual Federal Reserve speeches this week, and the market is likely thinking that today’s outcome will make officials wary of committing to significant policy easing,” analysts at ING said in a note to clients on Monday.  Some analysts, however, believe the ballooning fiscal debt will eventually force the Fed to cut rates rapidly, offering a major bullish tailwind to crypto prices. The Fed raised rates from zero to 5.5% in 16 months to July 2023 to tame inflation. The so-called tightening was partly responsible for bitcoin’s 80% price crash in 2022.  Looking ahead, bitcoin may remain volatile for some time as several job reports are lined up this week, including Friday’s nonfarm payrolls figure and the unemployment rate.

Similarly, Charting Guy believes that XLM could follow a similar trajectory, reaching a target of $13. XRP and XLM have displayed symmetrical triangle patterns, according to Charting Guy's analysis. Optimistic Long-Term Prospects For XRP And XLM While these short-term targets are ambitious, Charting Guy’s outlook extends beyond the current market cycle.

Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison last Thursday for his conviction on seven different fraud and conspiracy charges.  Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and former CEO of the defunct crypto exchange FTX, has said that he is remorseful for his actions after he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for fraud last week.  Bankman-Fried was interviewed via email by ABC News from the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. Last Thursday, while announcing the sentence, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan said Bankman-Fried never offered “a word of remorse” for his “terrible crimes.”  “It’s most of what I think about each day,” Bankman-Fried told ABC News. “I never thought that what I was doing was illegal. But I tried to hold myself to a high standard, and I certainly didn’t meet that standard. I’ve heard and seen the despair, frustration and sense of betrayal from thousands of customers; they deserve to be paid in full at the current price.”  The former FTX boss said the insolvency of FTX was the result of several “bad decisions” he made in 2022. Bankman-Fried also noted that the customers “could and should” have been paid in 2022, and it’s “excruciating to see them waiting, day after day.”  “I’m haunted, every day, by what was lost. I never intended to hurt anyone or take anyone’s money. But I was the CEO of FTX, I was responsible for what happened to the company, and when you’re responsible, it doesn’t matter why it goes bad. I’d give anything to be able to help repair even part of the damage. I’m doing what I can from prison, but it’s deeply frustrating not to be able to do more,” he said to ABC News.  On Thursday, Bankman-Fried’s defense team said it would be appealing. During the interview with ABC News, Bankman-Fried said certain trial testimony “greatly misstated what actually happened,” and his defense was “not allowed to introduce crucial evidence or put on important witnesses.”  Read all of CoinDesk’s coverage on the Sam Bankman-Fried trial here.",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE,Amitoj Singh,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/04/02/sam-bankman-fried-now-feels-remorse-for-his-actions-after-getting-a-25-year-prison-sentence,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6795c279b3f20b19aa3053558169f9e733cba742-4037x2271.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

DOGE must stay above the $0.1750 support zone to start a fresh increase. DOGE struggled to stay above $0.225 and corrected gains against the US dollar. The price is trading above the $0.1750 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $0.2040 on the 4-hour chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could restart its increase unless there is a close below the $0.1750 support. Dogecoin Price Approaches Key Support After a steady increase, Dogecoin price attempted more gains above the $0.230 zone. However, DOGE struggled above $0.2250. A high was formed at $0.2294 and the price started a downside correction, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a drop below the $0.2050 and $0.200 support levels. The price dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1228 swing low to the $0.2294 high. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $0.2040 on the 4-hour chart of the DOGE/USD pair.

Source: DOGEUSD on TradingView.com On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $0.1950 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.200 level. A close above the $0.200 resistance might send the price toward the $0.2150 resistance. The next major resistance is near $0.2300. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.2500 level. More Downsides in DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to gain pace above the $0.200 level, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1820 level. The next major support is near the $0.1750 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1228 swing low to the $0.2294 high. If there is a downside break below the $0.1750 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.1480 level.

25106411,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=600871,1712026843,"FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried Breaks Silence, Announces Appeal For 25-Year Conviction","In a recent interview with ABC News, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), the co-founder and former CEO of the now-bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX, spoke about his remorse and plans for an appeal following his recent 25-year prison sentence for fraud. FTX Co-Founder Admits Errors Bankman-Fried, currently held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, shared his reflections on the unfolding events. He admitted to making several “bad decisions” in 2022 that led to FTX’s insolvency. Although he claimed he had never considered his actions illegal, Bankman-Fried acknowledged falling short of the “high ethical standard” he set for himself. Related Reading: Get Ready For A Bitcoin Cash Revolution: Analyst Forecasts Historic Breakout During the sentencing, US District Judge Lewis Kaplan accused Bankman-Fried of perjury and evasiveness during his testimony, criticizing his lack of remorse for the crimes committed. In response, Bankman-Fried affirmed his remorse and expressed empathy for the thousands of customers who suffered financial losses. SBF claimed the following: I’m haunted, every day, by what was lost. I never intended to hurt anyone or take anyone’s money. But I was the CEO of FTX, I was responsible for what happened to the company, and when you’re responsible it doesn’t matter why it goes bad. I’d give anything to be able to help repair even part of the damage. I’m doing what I can from prison, but it’s deeply frustrating not to be able to do more Bankman-Fried also acknowledged the impact on his co-workers, who reportedly dedicated their lives to FTX, and the charities he supported, whose funding was affected by the company’s collapse. The disgraced crypto mogul expressed deep regret for “throwing away” what they had worked hard for and expressed a desire to repair at least part of the damage caused. Despite his efforts from prison, Bankman-Fried admitted to feeling frustrated by the limitations on what he could do to rectify the situation. In his statement to the court, Bankman-Fried contended that if he or another FTX employee had remained CEO, customers would have been paid back by now. He attributed the delay in compensation to the company’s decision not to restart the FTX exchange, which he believed could have created long-term value. Sam Bankman-Fried Claims ‘Unfair’ Trial, Plans Appeal During the interview, Bankman-Fried also raised concerns about the fairness of his trial, specifically calling out Sullivan & Cromwell, the law firm representing FTX’s new owners. SBF accused them of colluding with the prosecution and preventing him from accessing key FTX documents shared with the prosecution. Bankman-Fried claimed this had a “detrimental effect” on the entire trial, including media coverage and the defense’s ability to present evidence in his favor. Responding to Bankman-Fried’s claims, a spokesperson for Sullivan & Cromwell referred to Judge Kaplan’s sentencing remarks, highlighting Bankman-Fried’s perjury on the witness stand and his strategy of blaming lawyers and the bankruptcy process instead of accepting responsibility for his crimes. Related Reading: Forget Bitcoin, Altcoins Are The Winners Of This Cycle, Crypto Analyst Says Looking ahead, Bankman-Fried revealed that his defense team plans to appeal the conviction later this year, primarily based on certain trial testimony that he felt greatly misrepresented the actual events. He also mentioned the importance of introducing “crucial evidence” and presenting key witnesses, which his defense was allegedly not allowed to do during the trial. As Bankman-Fried begins his prison term, he acknowledges the gravity of the situation, having lost everything. While expressing a desire to make a positive difference in the world, he recognizes the limitations of his current circumstances and remains committed to seeking justice through appeals.

This level of performance represents a culmination of investor confidence, market dynamics, and underlying economic factors that paint a broader picture of the digital currency’s “resilience and appeal.” Crypto analyst Ali has recently shed light on a critical juncture in Bitcoin’s journey, identifying a significant resistance level that could influence its short-term price movements. Related Reading: Get Ready For A Bitcoin Cash Revolution: Analyst Forecasts Historic Breakout Key Resistance Awaits Ali’s analysis brings to the forefront a specific resistance barrier that Bitcoin faces on its path to achieving a new ATH. According to Ali, a resistance level at $70,320, characterized by a total volume of 599,260 BTC held by 736,380 addresses, stands as the gatekeeper to further bullish momentum. Surpassing this threshold could potentially catalyze Bitcoin’s ascent, further solidifying its status as the pinnacle of the cryptocurrency market.

Caution Amid Bitcoin Record Streak Amidst this backdrop, author and former hedge fund manager Jim Cramer has voiced his observations, suggesting that the market is “the most overbought” it has been in a while. The observations come just as Bitcoin marks its seventh month of positive performance, a milestone last achieved in 2012. This period of growth is highlighted by a monthly candlestick chart closing higher than the peak of its last cycle. Adding to this “overbought” sentiment by Jim Cramer is a transaction of the seventh wealthiest Bitcoin address withdrawing 8,889 BTC from Bitfinex, valued at roughly $627 million, recorded by Peckshield.

25102979,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=600845,1712019640,Litecoin Soars Above $110 As LTC Breaks Out Of Macro Downtrend: Analysts,"Litecoin (LTC) has shown a notable performance in the first quarter of the year, reaching over 30 million transactions by March 30. Last year, this feat was achieved around July when LTC traded at around $113. The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) recently classified Litecoin as a commodity alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. The designation and rumors of a Litecoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) sparked bullish sentiment. Analysts and investors have forecasted a strong performance for the token. Related Reading: Litecoin ETF Rumors Fuel 10% Surge As Institutions Hint At Interest Is Litecoin Out Of The Woods? Litecoin surged 10% last week, seemingly fueled by the positive sentiment from its community. As a result, the token rose above $100 and tested its resistance above the $105 level. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital confirmed that, as April 1st started, LTC officially broke the macro downtrend for the first time since April 2021. $LTC Litecoin has Monthly Closed above the Downtrend It is confirmed The Macro Downtrend has been broken for the first time since April 2021 The Macro Downtrend is now officially over#LTC #Crypto #Litecoin https://t.co/yU7Gz7X1ck pic.twitter.com/ktgOYKTarz — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) April 1, 2024 According to the analyst, after successfully retesting its multi-year macro downtrend and turning it into a new support level, the token had to stay above the $94 price range to confirm the end of the trend. LTC closed the month above these levels. The token’s price soared past $110 for the second time this year. Nonetheless, the price didn’t hold for long, as it immediately faced a correction and dropped back to the $105-106 range. After the correction, analyst The Cryptonomist suggested in an X post that if LTC’s price gets a “clean break” above this level, investors could “comfortably see” the price surge to $200. Moreover, crypto investor Crypto Surf pointed out that Litecoin “managed to close at or slightly above the 200-week,” considering it a “not bad” performance. In the charts, Crypto Surf highlights key points from the token’s performance from 2017-2021 and 2021-2024. $LTC did actually manage to close at or slightly above the 200 week MA 😅 Let's see what these new quarter, month and week bring us⌛️ For now, we're above the meme lines, so not bad. https://t.co/xqTDWet7tv pic.twitter.com/GT3asJBQF2 — Surf (@_CryptoSurf) April 1, 2024 The $146 pre-halving top of Litecoin’s second halving event was surpassed approximately three months after breaking out of its 200-week moving average (MA). This breakout was followed by LTC’s all-time high (ATH) of $410 in 2021. After Litecoin’s third halving event, LTC’s pre-halving top reached the $115 price range. This top was tested and almost matched today when the token traded at $112. The charts suggest that, if history repeats itself, LTC’s price could be testing higher resistance levels and a new ATH in the coming months. However, market dynamics and external events could hinder the token’s potential targets. Was LTC’s Rise To $112 An April’s Fool Day Prank? After briefly reaching its highest price of the year, LTC faced a correction that shredded the gains registered over the weekend. The token closed its March monthly candle above important metrics and has resisted above $100 during the past three days. Despite this, the price dipped below that important support zone. LTC has hovered around the $98-99 price range for the past hour. This drop represents a 3.8% decrease from LTC’s price 24 hours ago and a 76.4% dip from its ATH. However, Litecoin’s LTC continues to register green numbers over longer timeframes. LTC has increased 8.8% and 8.9% in the weekly and monthly timeframes. More notably, the token had a 19.9% biweekly surge. Similarly, its daily trading volume has significantly surged by 186.5%, reaching $1.61 billion in the past 24 hours. LTC ranks as the 19th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap data. At the time of writing, Litecoin is trading at $99.13.

Emphasizing Bitcoin’s immense potential, the hedge fund manager has crowned it as the unrivaled “King” among digital assets. $150,000 Price Target Set For BTC Appearing in a recent interview with CNBC Television on March 27, Yusko shared a bold forecast of Bitcoin, predicting that the cryptocurrency will see a significant rise to $150,000 in 2024. When asked why he believes the cryptocurrency would have such an astronomical price increase, Yusko cited the impacts of the upcoming Bitcoin halving and Spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF), on the price of BTC. The hedge fund manager has revealed that historically after a BTC halving cycle is completed, the fair value of the cryptocurrency rises. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Breaks New 3-Year High – Here Are Factors That Could Drive The Price To $1 He explained that when the upcoming 2024 Bitcoin halving occurs in April, BTC miners will face challenges, with transaction fees poised to soar, consequently driving a price increase to $75,000. After the Bitcoin halving event, the cryptocurrency is expected to surge two times its fair value to $150,000. The hedge fund manager cited factors like increased interest from investors and Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) as triggers for this price spike. Yusko also revealed that after the Bitcoin halving, there would be a surge in demand for Spot Bitcoin ETFs, while the supply of new coins would decrease from 900 BTC to 450 BTC a day. “If there’s more demand than supply, price has to rise,” the hedge fund manager stated. The investment management CEO has expressed a strong belief in BTC’S value as one of the world’s leading digital assets. He envisions the cryptocurrency “easily” skyrocketing by 10x over the next decade. “Bitcoin is the king, it is the dominant token. It is a better form of gold or digital property. And I do think it will be the best,” Yusko said. Bitcoin Price Top Expected By Year’s End During his interview, Yusko predicted that Bitcoin could reach its peak price value by the end of 2024. The hedge fund manager disclosed that historically, nine months after a Bitcoin halving event, sometime in December, BTC undergoes a surge to its peak value before entering the next bear market.
