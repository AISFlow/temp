42408375,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaIOms,1714086060,UK Law Enforcement Agencies Can Now Seize Crypto More Easily as New Rules Take Effect,"New powers that will make it easier for law enforcement agencies to seize crypto come into effect on Friday.  The U.K. passed a crime bill last year to aid crypto seizures, allowing law enforcement agencies to seize funds before making arrests.  New powers that will help law enforcement agencies seize crypto used for crime came into effect on Friday, the U.K Home Office said in a press release.  As a result of these new rules, police in the country will no longer be required to make an arrest before seizing crypto holdings, the Home Office announced. The new rules came after the U.K. Parliament passed a crime bill last year, which laid the foundations for crypto to be seized more quickly.  ""This will make it easier to take assets which are known to have been criminally obtained, even if sophisticated criminals are able to protect their anonymity or are based overseas,"" Friday's press release said.  The police has stationed crypto tactical advisors across the country and has already seized hundreds of millions of pounds worth of crypto. In January, the National Crime Agency worked with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to investigate a drug enterprise which led to $150 million in cash and crypto being seized.  ""It is vital that investigators and prosecutors have the capability and agility to keep pace with this changing nature of crime which these new measures will greatly assist our ability to restrain, freeze, or eliminate crypto assets from illegal enterprise,"" said Chief Crown Prosecutor Adrian Foster in the press release.  Officers will also be able to transfer the crypto into a wallet controlled by law enforcement agencies. They will be able to destroy crypto assets ""if returning it to circulation is not conducive to the public good.""  The press release pointed to privacy coins as an example of an asset type where seized coins may be destroyed.  ""These reforms will also enhance our national security,"" Home Secretary James Cleverly said in the statement. ""Terrorist organizations like Daesh are known to raise funds through crypto transactions and these updated powers will enable our agencies to more easily strip them of their assets.""

This has triggered a wave of bearish sentiment in the market, causing a large number of crypto traders to go short on the pioneer cryptocurrency. As a result, these bears lose, risking a large amount if the Bitcoin price resumes its bullish rally. Bears Will Lose $7.2 Billion If Bitcoin Reclaims All-Time High In a post shared on X (formerly Twitter), crypto analyst Ash Crypto revealed an interesting trend concerning Bitcoin that has been developing.

However, they stand to lose a lot of money if BTC is able to clear this resistance and resume upward. According to Ash Crypto, there is over $7.2 billion worth of BTC shorts which risk liquidation if Bitcoin were to reach a new all-time high price above $74,000. At the time, the Bitcoin price had recovered above $66,000, spurring a flurry of bearish activity in the market.

Source: Coinglass BTC Bulls Are Not Giving Up Even though Bitcoin bears seem to be making bank with the price of Bitcoin falling, the bulls are far from done. Rather, they have been using this price decline as an opportunity to fill up their bags. This accumulation has been even more prominent among Bitcoin whales, who have picked up 1.4% of the total supply in the last month. On-chain data tracker Santiment reported that in the last four weeks, Bitcoin whales have added 266,000 BTC to their balance. The cohort responsible for this are those holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC, making them the mega whales. In total, they spent $17.8 billion on buying BTC in just one month.

ADA’s Key Metric Hits Low, What This Means For Investors","Data from analytics platform IntoTheBlock have illuminated a troubling trend within the Cardano (ADA) network, showing a significant dip in ‘profitability’ for its holders. While cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and TRX show a high percentage of holders in profit, Cardano stands in stark contrast, with only 35% of its holders currently seeing gains. This insight into the Cardano ecosystem reveals deeper challenges, as many of ADA’s transactions now appear to be at a loss. The chart below shows the percentage of holders in profit on several top layer 1 networks 👇 Bitcoin remains king, with $TRX being a close second. $DOGE and $ETH also have the vast majority of holders in profit. $ADA stands out with only 35% of holders in profit. But is this… pic.twitter.com/x9YwfuNIN4 — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) April 24, 2024 Details Into ADA Investors Profitability The report’s specifics indicate that out of 1.59 million addresses holding 14.07 billion ADA, a substantial amount of these tokens were acquired at higher price points that are not profitable under current market conditions. Related Reading: Cardano ADA Trades Below The $0.41 Mark, Will It Break The Barriers? In particular, 2.73 million addresses are underwater, holding 20.07 billion ADA purchased at price levels between $0.5975 and $0.7265. This significant segment of loss-bearing investments places downward pressure on ADA’s market price, contributing to recent price volatility. Despite the immediate bearish outlook, ADA has shown resilience with a weekly gain of 4.2%, bringing its price to $0.4661 at the time of writing. This slight recovery suggests that while short-term pressures are evident, investor confidence remains in the token’s fundamentals. Notably, the crypto community is buzzing about potential future gains for ADA based on historical data and technical analysis. Prominent crypto analyst Ali has pointed out that ADA’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio is lower than -22%, indicating that the asset is significantly undervalued. This situation is similar to June 2023, following which ADA experienced a substantial 75% increase in value. Ali forecasts a potential surge in ADA’s price to $0.80 from these past trends, which would mark a significant recovery and the highest value for the token in over a year. The last time #Cardano‘s MVRV Ratio dipped below -22%, $ADA‘s price soared by over 75%. With the #ADA MVRV Ratio back under -22%, we could see another impressive rebound! pic.twitter.com/ABf0mp4pR4 — Ali (@ali_charts) April 19, 2024 Cardano Technical Analysis Supports Bullish Predictions Another analyst, Trend Rider on X, further supported the optimistic projections for ADA and noted that Cardano’s technical indicators signal a potential bull run. According to Trend Rider, ADA’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Simple Moving Average (SMA) crossovers form a pattern that mirrors previous setups, leading to major price increases. For instance, a similar formation was observed before ADA’s monumental rise from $0.05 to $3.00. This confluence of technical and market value analyses presents a compelling case for Cardano’s potential turnaround. While current holder profitability is low, the technical indicators and historical performance suggest that ADA could be on the cusp of a significant upward trajectory.

26373706,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=605064,1714078839,Bitcoin Forms Death Cross & TD-9 Sell Signal: Brace For Impact?,"An analyst has explained how Bitcoin is forming both a death cross and TD sell signal, which may lead to potential dips in these targets. Bitcoin Looking In Trouble As 12-Hour Chart Forms Two Bearish Signals In a new post on X, analyst Ali discussed two signals that have recently formed in Bitcoin’s 12-hour chart. The first of these is a “death cross,” which occurs when an asset’s short-term simple moving average (SMA) dips below its long-term SMA. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Continue Buying, Now Hold 25.16% Of All Supply Regarding the death cross, the 50-day and 100-day SMAs make up for the short-term and long-term trend lines. Historically, such formations have been considered bearish signals, with the price potentially suffering once the pattern is confirmed. The other signal that has appeared for the cryptocurrency involves the Tom Demark (TD) Sequential. This indicator is popularly used for finding locations of probable tops and bottoms in any asset’s price. The TD Sequential has two phases: the “setup” and “countdown.” The first phase, the setup, is said to be complete once the asset has gone through nine candles of the same polarity. After these nine candles, the price may have reached a likely reversal point. Naturally, if the candles in the setup’s formation were red, then the signal would be a buy one, while if the prevailing trend were bullish, the reversal would be towards the downside. Once the setup is complete, the countdown phase begins. This phase works much like the setup, except that candles are counted up to thirteen instead of nine. After the countdown’s completion, the commodity may be assumed to have reached another potential top/bottom. Now, here is the chart shared by Ali that highlights how signals about both of these technical analysis patterns have been witnessed in the 12-hour price of Bitcoin recently: The two signals that the 12-hour BTC price has formed in recent days | Source: @ali_charts on X As is visible in the graph, the 12-hour price of Bitcoin first saw a death cross form with the 50-day SMA moving under the 100-day SMA. Then, it observed the completion of a TD Sequential setup, with the indicator suggesting a reversal to the downward direction. Since this double bearish pattern has appeared, BTC has been heading down, suggesting that these signals may already be in effect. “If BTC falls below $63,300, brace for possible dives to $61,000 or even $59,000,” says the analyst.

From the current price of the cryptocurrency, a potential drawdown to the first of these targets would mean a decline of 4.6%, while one to the latter level would suggest a drop of nearly 8%.

This downtrend can be attributed to the price movement of the flagship crypto, Bitcoin. Dogecoin Drops Alongside Bitcoin Dogecoin’s price also experienced a sharp decline as the flagship crypto dropped from over $66,000 to below $64,000 in the last 24 hours. Altcoins like DOGE are known to experience a similar downtrend whenever Bitcoin’s price records a correction like the way it has done. Generally, the global crypto market is down over 4%, thanks to this occurrence. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Exchange Balances Reach New Low As SHIB Bounces Off Golden Ratio Several factors are believed to have contributed to Bitcoin’s recent decline (and, by extension, Dogecoin and other altcoins). One is the upcoming release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation data on April 26. Despite estimates from the Cleveland Fed, predicting that the PCE data will show that inflation has slowed, crypto investors are still wary, given that the March Consumer Price Index (CPI) data didn’t show any disinflationary progress. Crypto investors are also still apprehensive about the conflict in the Middle East. Although tensions between Israel and Iran seem to have subsided, there is still the belief that things could quickly get heated again. The impact this geopolitical conflict has on the crypto market has become evident, and investors want to avoid getting burned again. Meanwhile, the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which now significantly impact the crypto market, have seen their inflows slow this month. The demand for these investment funds has drastically dropped, contributing to the unimpressive price action among crypto tokens like Dogecoin, given the amount of liquidity they brought into the market at their peak. Interestingly, the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, recorded zero daily inflows into its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) for the first time on April 24, further underscoring how bad things have become. DOGE Still Expected To Experience Further Price Declines Based on crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto’s recent analysis, the foremost meme coin is still expected to experience further price declines even when the crypto market picks up again. The analyst mentioned that the crypto market is getting to the point where liquidity in memes like Dogecoin and other altcoins will get sucked by Bitcoin as it makes its move to $100,000. Related Reading: Analyst Singles Out VeChain And XRP For Parabolic Surge, Here Are The Targets The crypto analyst predicts that Dogecoin could drop to as low as $0.5 when this happens, suggesting there wouldn’t be enough liquidity for the meme coin to maintain any uptrend. However, crypto analyst Kevin (formerly OG Yomi) offered a different opinion, noting that nothing on the monthly time frame suggests Dogecoin will drop to as low as $0.5.

The fintech giant stopped supporting bitcoin in 2018 during the first crypto winter.  Six years after dropping support for bitcoin {{BTC}} and, thus, crypto payments altogether, Stripe is bringing back the service later this summer, though initially only for Circle’s USDC stablecoin.  “We’re excited to announce that we’re bringing back crypto as a way to accept payments, but this time with a much better experience,” Stripe co-founder and President John Collison said Thursday in a keynote address at the company’s Global Internet Economy conference.  The payments processor has a long history in crypto, first tapping the bitcoin ecosystem in 2014. Four years later, in 2018, it discontinued all of those efforts, arguing that bitcoin was too volatile and would function as an asset rather than a medium of exchange. It had also criticized its lengthy transaction times and growing fees at the time.  That year saw bitcoin’s first “crypto winter” with the token dropping from a high of $19,650 in December 2017 to $3,401 at the end of 2018.  The fintech giant took a step toward re-entering the market the following year by becoming a co-founder of Facebook’s Libra project, but it stepped away later that year and Libra never got off the ground. In 2022, Stripe introduced a project to facilitate fiat-to-crypto payments.  “Crypto is finding real utility,” Collison said in his keynote Thursday. “With transaction speeds increasing and costs coming down, we’re seeing crypto finally making sense as a means of exchange.”  Payments will be available on the Solana {{SOL}}, Ethereum {{ETH}} and Polygon {{MATIC}} blockchains, Stripe said.  The company is currently valued at $65 billion, according to Bloomberg, and is one of the biggest payments providers in the world with over $1 trillion in transactions in 2023.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH | MATIC | SOL | USDC,BTC | ETH | MATIC | SOL | USDC,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/04/25/stripe-brings-back-crypto-payments-via-usdc-stablecoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/717af895aef836fe95b024859bfcedde5f6c3e71-5760x3240.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42408378,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaIOtU,1714070190,Consensys Sues SEC Over ‘Unlawful Seizure Of Authority’ Over Ethereum,"Ethereum developer Consensys has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, striking back against what the company calls an “unlawful seizure of authority” over Ethereum by the federal regulator.  The company wants a federal court to declare that ETH {{ETH}} is not a security, any investigation of ConsenSys based on the idea that ETH is a security ""would violate"" the company's fifth amendment rights and the Administrative Procedures Act, that MetaMask is not a broker under federal law, that MetaMask's staking service does not violate securities law and an injunction against the SEC investigating or bringing an enforcement action tied to MetaMask's Swaps or Staking functions.  In the complaint filed Thursday against the SEC and all five of its commissioners, Consensys revealed it received a Wells notice from the SEC on April 10, indicating its intention to bring an enforcement action against the company for violating securities laws via its MetaMask wallet product. Consensys denies that it acts as a broker, stating that the wallet is “simply and interface” and “neither holds customers’ digital assets nor carries out any transaction functions.”  The complaint adds that the SEC’s encroaching authority over Ethereum goes against its own past statements that the cryptocurrency is a commodity, not a security (citing former director Bill Hinman's 2018 speech), as well as the SEC’s sister regulatory agency, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), own authority over Ethereum, which oversees derivative products tied to ether.  In its suit, Consensys claims that it “built its business against the backdrop of this regulatory consensus”, and the SEC’s new grab for power – which it calls an “about-face” – over Ethereum would therefore “violate the Constitutional requirement of fair notice under the Due Process Clause.”  ""The SEC’s unlawful seizure of authority over ETH would spell disaster for the Ethereum network, and for Consensys,"" the suit claims.  A representative for the SEC declined to comment on the suit.  The suit also leans on the ""major questions doctrine,"" a Supreme Court ruling barring federal regulators from dramatically exceeding the scope of their Congressional mandates. Two judges have already rejected the idea that crypto falls under the doctrine during arguments brought by Terraform Labs and Coinbase.  ConsenSys filed the suit in the District Court for the Northern District of Texas, joining groups like the Blockchain Association and companies like Legit Exchange, which filed similar preemptive suits seeking to block the SEC from treating certain crypto companies or assets as securities.  In recent months, the SEC has also brought suits against crypto exchanges like Binance.US, Binance and Kraken. Uniswap Labs revealed earlier this month it had also received a Wells Notice from the regulator.

Related Reading: Solana Meme Coin Massacre: 12 Projects Gone In 30 Days, $27 Million Vanished Memecoin Trader Makes Millions According to Lookonchain data, a memecoin trader named James Wynn multiplied its PEPE investment by 1,503.

When the token started gaining momentum, he sold over half his holdings, 1.81 trillion tokens, for $4.57 million. jwynn.eth(@JamesWynnReal) – A smart trader who made $12.8M(1,503x) on $PEPE. He also traded $BOBO and $ANDY recently, making another $818K! 1/ Let’s dig into his trades.👇 pic.twitter.com/2vOkjObVPr — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 24, 2024 After the frog-themed memecoin became a market sensation, the trader’s unrealized profits on his remaining bag exponentially increased. Currently, Wynn holds 1.02 trillion PEPE in three wallets worth $8.25 million. The trader’s total profits from PEPE total $12.8 million. However, if he had held onto his tokens, the gains would have exceeded $20 million. Per the blockchain research platform, Wynn’s feat doesn’t end with PEPE. He has also made over $800,000 trading other memecoins over the week. He recently bought five tokens, two of which remain profitable: BOBO and ANDY. At the time of the report, the trader bought over 273.62 billion BOBO for $138.263, making a profit of $430,000. Similarly, he acquired 4.711 billion ANDY for $115.493, gaining over $338,000. Nonetheless, not all of Wynn’s trades resulted in success. According to the X post, the trader has a 45% success rate, gaining over $13.7 million with nine memecoins and losing around $350,000 on eleven tokens, including some rug pulls. Breakdown of the 20 tokens traded by Wynn. Source: Lookonchain Whales Go On PEPE Buying Spree As reported by NewsBTC, recent data showed that PEPE’s price decline over the last month has reduced the number of addresses carrying gains. However, this has not stopped whales from accumulating the token. This week, a whale accumulated 211.6 billion PEPE from Binance, Gateio, and Uniswap. The address bought the tokens at an average of $0.000007291, spending $1.54 million. The buying spree turned profitable as, some hours later, the token’s price increased by 17%. According to Spot On Chain, the holdings’ worth surged to $1.72 million, making $173,000 in unrealized profits. Other reports suggest that whales have continued accumulating and taking profits from their PEPE holdings. However, the token’s market activity decreased by 22.1% in the last 24 hours, with a $1.2 billion daily trading volume. PEPE’s market capitalization has also dropped 1.58%. Despite this, the token has regained its spot as the third largest memecoin by this metric, as dogwifhat (WIF) lost 13.88% of its market cap on the last day. It’s worth noting that WIF flipped PEPE on March 28 after becoming the newest sensation in the crypto market. As of this writing, PEPE is changing hands for $0.000007821, representing an 11.4% drop in the monthly timeframe.

The time when conversations about ENO were limited to specific groups interested in wine and cryptocurrency is now behind us. ENO aims to draw in a broad spectrum of people, seamlessly connecting the cryptocurrency domain with establishing vibrant communities. ENO spearheads the creation of the world’s inaugural decentralized platform dedicated to celebrating the variety of wine culture. Its mission is to bring together connoisseurs of wine and cryptocurrency from around the globe, using cutting-edge blockchain technology to nurture a dynamic community dedicated to cultivating and appreciating fine wines. The dynamic ecosystem of ENO includes a wide array of platforms, from the esteemed ENO Social Clubs and the innovative ENO Swap to the enchanting ENOVERSE and several other fascinating initiatives. ENO is trailblazing by integrating the venerable wine industry with the forefront of technology, creating a novel economic framework within its ecosystem. This venture into digital assets, including Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and special event access, represents a significant shift in our engagement with value and passions. Let’s see what kind of assets are supporting and fueling the ENO ecosystem. ENO token – the backbone of the whole ecosystem Throughout an extensive exploration and development phase, ENO identified significant gaps within various sectors, including wine, real estate, music, and art. These disconnects were primarily linked to marketing and the inability to resonate with the evolving preferences of newer generations. ENO believes that these divides can be bridged by creating all-encompassing social club ecosystems and cultivating trust and connectivity within its community. To achieve these objectives, ENO plans to deploy various tools, among which the ENO token stands out as a fuel for the ecosystem. This fundamental utility token is integral to all future systems deployed by ENO, with the level of token possession influencing a community member’s level of engagement within ENO’s expanding infrastructure. In addition, the ENO tokens are accessible at services offered by ENO Labs and ENO Academy, which provide expansive toolsets tailored to their specific applications and benefit all participants. Holders of the ENO tokens can access a wealth of educational resources, including various courses, virtual and in-person workshops, educational videos, articles, and much more. The ENO token, essential for participation across ENO’s forthcoming services, will dictate the depth of a community member’s involvement. Available on LAtoken, Bitmart, and Uniswap, the asset will soon be highlighted in a thorough token sale campaign scheduled for April. ENO Digital Assets – One-way ticket to a world of entertainment The initiative proudly offers many distinct and thrilling advantages through the ENO digital asset (EDA). Among these EDAs, NFTs stand out, providing a foundation for an economy where members can capitalize on their asset ownership for benefits like event participation and beyond. Yet, the scope of ENO digital assets transcends wine alone. These assets unlock a myriad of novel and thrilling opportunities within the ENO ecosystem, including NFTs that facilitate the establishment of an economy. Asset ownership can be leveraged for perks such as event access. In addition, ENO digital assets will be accessible to pay for tangible rewards at ENO social club gatherings, whether through augmented reality or in-person at various Bosque Real property events. Every EDA is distinct, granting its owner special access to specific experiences within the ecosystem. Exceptional EDAs might even allow their owners to attend private and exclusive ENO social club events or enjoy additional high-end ecosystem features. In a strategic partnership, ENO has joined forces with Bosque Real to host club events and activities. This alliance brings exclusive perks to NFT owners, including access to an elite golf course, a specialized workspace, and the distinctive ENO Embassy. Additionally, membership opens the door to engaging experiences, such as virtual reality experiences featuring the Bosque Real Logo, special dining discounts at the hub, and exclusive brand merchandise. As for the things to come Having done the heavy lifting, ENO doesn’t hold back and strives to innovate and reinvent once more. In the near future, according to ENO’s roadmap, we can expect launches of various NFT tools ranging from the ENO embassy badge and different NFTs to an exciting new marketplace. Most of these additions to the ENO ecosystem will be accomplished with the use of Arbitrum, a supporter of ENO from the very get-go. With its steps further, ENO is set to embark on a journey that redefines blockchain technology and cryptocurrency possibilities. The team is excited to welcome users, developers, and enthusiasts to join in building a greener, more sustainable future for the digital asset industry.

The financial expert has cautioned investors of the potential repercussions should BTC drop below critical resistance levels. Economist Predicts Bitcoin Price Decline In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, Schiff shared a price chart of Bitcoin against the United States Dollar (USD), pinpointing Bitcoin’s price at the time of the post at $63,814, alongside key support levels around $60,000. The economist has argued that Bitcoin’s current price position was not conducive for HODLers. Related Reading: Brace For Impact: Worldcoin Team Plans To Sell 1.5 Million WLD Tokens Every Week For 6 Months Emphasizing the importance of BTC maintaining a stronghold above $60,000, Schiff urged investors to proceed with caution and hope that the cryptocurrency successfully sustains support levels. He also predicted that if Bitcoin failed to hold critical support levels, a substantial price decline would be inevitable. While Schiff’s predictions may appear to align with his usual skepticism towards Bitcoin, the timing of his warnings coincides with a period of heightened uncertainty and volatility surrounding Bitcoin’s price. The cryptocurrency is currently trading at $63,909, marking a notable decrease from its previous all-time high of over $73,000 before the halving event. Data from CoinMarketCap has revealed a series of declines, with Bitcoin experiencing a 3.75% drop in the last 24 hours and a 4.38% decrease over the past month. This underscores the uncertain price condition of the pioneer cryptocurrency, hinting at the possibility of further declines unless the cryptocurrency makes a quick price correction. Schiff has stated that while experienced Bitcoin holders are accustomed to large price drops and periods of volatility, new investors who have recently entered the Spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) market should be prepared for a “rude awakening.” Crypto Analyst Says Potential Upsurge In Store For BTC On Monday, April 22, prominent crypto analyst, Ali Martinez shared insights on Bitcoin’s future price trajectory in an X post. Martinez noted that the price of Bitcoin was steadily rising, aiming to secure new highs around $66,000. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Exchange Balances Reach New Low As SHIB Bounces Off Golden Ratio The crypto analyst predicts that if Bitcoin can successfully break past key support levels at $66,000, the cryptocurrency’s next critical resistance level would be between $69,900 and $71,200. Despite this optimistic forecast, Martinez has also warned investors about a potential pullback, emphasizing the importance of exercising caution and closely monitoring Bitcoin’s price if it falls below $65,500. With Bitcoin currently priced at $63,909, it has fallen notably below the key support level highlighted by Martinez. This continuous price decrease could be attributed to recent trends indicating that Bitcoin’s accumulation score has dropped to zero. This suggests that whales may be moving away from the pioneer cryptocurrency or refraining from accumulating Bitcoin at its present price level.

The move allows investors of the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX) to transfer the fund's BENJI token between each other without any intermediary. The BENJI token, available on the Stellar {{XLM}} and Polygon {{MATIC}} blockchains, represents shares in the fund that holds government securities, cash and repurchase agreements and pays out a steady yield to token holders.  ""Allowing fund shares to be transferred peer-to-peer puts Franklin Templeton on the cutting edge of the financial sector where tokenized real-world assets are an industry staple and more open, transparent, and accessible,"" Jason Chlipala, chief business officer of Stellar Development Foundation, said in an email.  The development is important because transferability allows to expand the token's utility in the future such as trading on secondary markets or using it as collateral for loans in the decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.  ""Eventually, we hope for assets built on blockchain rails [...] to work seamlessly with the rest of the digital asset ecosystem,"" Roger Bayston, head of digital assets at Franklin Templeton, said in a press release.  Tokenized U.S. Treasuries are at the forefront of the race to bring traditional financial assets such as bonds to blockchain rails – also known as tokenization of real-world assets. The market for tokenized Treasuries have mushroomed to $1.2 billion, growing tenfold since early 2023, as digital asset investors have been seeking safe yields for their blockchain-based cash holdings.  BENJI, launched in 2021, is the largest and oldest of them with a $380 million market capitalization, rwa.xyz data shows.

42408380,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaIP3P,1714062732,Kara Swisher Downplays Crypto's Significance: 'It's Not the Center of Everything',"Tech journalist and author Kara Swisher downplayed crypto's transformative potential, comparing it to a minor eruption versus the internet's major explosion.  Swisher criticized crypto's hype and ""scammery,"" predicting digital assets will settle as a niche within the broader tech landscape.  AI is now the focus, attracting major tech interest and investment, though it faces its own inflated hype cycle.  In an interview with CoinDesk's First Mover, technology journalist Kara Swisher, author of the New York Times bestseller ""Burn Book,"" said that she is skeptical that cryptocurrencies have transformative potential, calling digital assets important but not world-changing.  ""The internet was a major Cambrian explosion. This is a tiny one. I guess a volcanic eruption on Indonesia,"" she said on First Mover. ""It's a very important area of technology, but it's not the most important. It's not the center of everything.""  Swisher argued that the cryptocurrency sector has been caught up in a ""huge hype cycle"" with a considerable amount of ""scammery"" involved.  ""Crypto people really overplayed their hand in that regard, saying it's going to change everything,"" she said. ""This is a typical thing of technologists … [saying] that it's going to change the whole world.""  Swisher believes crypto will ultimately settle into being just another niche within the broader tech landscape, comparing it to many other technological innovations that have come and gone without reshaping the world.  ""It needs to replace something that's better. Digital downloads of books, for instance, aren't necessarily better than physical books, but they are very good,"" she said. ""[Crypto] overstepped itself, but it will settle into a nice, small corner.""  What follows crypto?  So if crypto is fizzing out, and is yet to fulfill the grand visions of its most ardent supporters, where is the the hype going?  Artificial intelligence, says Swisher.  AI isn't profitable yet because ""these ventures are very costly, requiring substantial investment in computing power and development,"" she said.  ""Unlike the early internet era, where anyone could launch ventures like Uber or Airbnb inexpensively, AI requires significant capital,"" she continued, citing OpenAI's Sam Altman wanting to raise enormous sums for projects like chip manufacturing.  ""Only the big companies can afford to lose this money and afford to pay for this,"" she said.  But AI has captured the interest of the public and major tech companies in a way that's taken some of the momentum away from blockchain and crypto, albeit not without its own hype and exaggerated claims similar to those seen in the crypto space.  ""AI is a big deal in comparison,"" she said. ""It's just that everyone has to slap AI onto their company name, and then they're an AI company.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TECHNOLOGY,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/25/kara-swisher-says-crypto-will-change-a-little-corner-of-the-world,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/390e7fdb2cd0f86c935e67489b4722bb89f36808-3273x1842.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Ordinals protocol allowed individual satoshis to be identified and traded, attaching value to particularly notable sats for the first time.  ViaBTC, the mining pool that mined the first block after the Bitcoin halving on April 20, sold the ""epic"" satoshi it contained for 33.3 BTC ($2.13 million).  An auction for the satoshi, or ""sat,"" which has a face value of around $0.0006, ended at 16:00 UTC on crypto exchange CoinEx following a flurry of competing bids during the final few hours.  There was an expectation the first sat produced by the Bitcoin network after its fourth halving event on April 20 would attract considerable interest with some commentators estimating that it could fetch millions of dollars.  In the three previous halvings, there was little up for grabs other than bragging rights for mining the first block. However, the advent of the Ordinals protocol meant sats – the smallest denomination of bitcoin, equal to 0.00000001 BTC – could be identified and traded as if they were unique tokens, similar to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on other networks.  Casey Rodarmor, the creator of Ordinals, formed a system for categorizing the rarity of sats. These could be ""uncommon,"" the first sat of each block; ""rare,"" the first one after Bitcoin's fortnightly difficulty adjustment; or ""epic,"" the first after a quadrennial halving.

26363286,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=605085,1714060812,Is Bitcoin’s Rally Over? Leverage Drops As Halving Highs Fade: Report,"Recent trends in the crypto market have indicated a notable shift in trader behavior, particularly among those investing in Bitcoin. Using data from CryptoQuant, Bloomberg has revealed that the Bitcoin funding rate—the cost for traders to open long positions in Bitcoin’s perpetual futures—has turned negative for the first time since October 2023. This change suggests a “cooling interest” in leveraging bullish bets on Bitcoin, coinciding with the fading impact of major market drivers. Related Reading: Is A $72K Bitcoin Surge On The Horizon? Glassnode’s Latest Analysis Points To An Answer Bitcoin Market Dynamics Post-Halving The decline in Bitcoin’s funding rate correlates with a reduction in net inflows to US spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), which previously pushed the cryptocurrency to record highs. Despite the anticipation surrounding the Bitcoin Halving—an event reducing the reward for mining new blocks and theoretically lessening the supply of new coins—the price impact has been surprisingly muted. According to Bloomberg, this subdued response has compounded the effects of broader economic factors, such as geopolitical tensions and changes in monetary policy expectations, leading to increased risk aversion among investors. Following the latest Bitcoin halving, the market has not seen the bullish surge many expected. Instead, Bitcoin has only seen a correction of over 10%, from its all-time high (ATH) in March with prices stabilizing in the $63,000 region, at the time of writing. As CryptoQuant’s Head of Research Julio Moreno pointed out, the recent downturn in Bitcoin’s funding rates to below zero underscores a “decreased eagerness” among traders to take long positions. According to Bloomberg, this trend is supported by a significant drop in daily inflows to US spot Bitcoin ETFs and a reduction in open interest in Bitcoin futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), which indicates a broader cooling of enthusiasm for crypto investments. [1/4] Bitcoin ETF Flow – 25 April 2024 – UPDATE pic.twitter.com/ojRayOFlnu — BitMEX Research (@BitMEXResearch) April 25, 2024 In a Bloomberg report, K33 Research analyst Vetle Lunde noted that the “current streak of neutral-to-below-neutral funding rates is unusual,” suggesting that the market might be entering a price-consolidation phase. Notably, this period of reduced leverage activity could potentially lead to further price stabilization, but it also raises questions about the near-term prospects for Bitcoin’s recovery. Adjustments In Mining Difficulty And Market Implications Interestingly, alongside these market adjustments, Bitcoin’s mining difficulty has increased for the first time immediately following the fourth halving. The difficulty adjustment, which occurs every 2016 block, increased by 2%, reaching a new high of 88.1 trillion, according to Bitbo data. This adjustment contradicts past trends where the difficulty typically decreased post-halving due to reduced profitability pushing less efficient miners out of the market. This anomaly in mining difficulty suggests that despite lower rewards post-Halving, miners remain active, possibly buoyed by more efficient mining technologies or strategic shifts within mining operations.

42408382,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaIP6i,1714060800,Crypto for Advisors: The Professionalization of Crypto,"With so much to learn about in the crypto space and so little time, how do you create investment strategies for your clients? Eric Ervin, CEO of Onramp Invest, provides an overview of crypto investment models that advisors can consider as clients’ interest in crypto investments grows.  Leo Mindyuk, CEO of ML Tech, covers active vs passive bitcoin and crypto investment strategies in Ask an Expert.  –S.M.  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  The Tip of the Iceberg: Building a Crypto Strategy Without Burning Out  My team and I have been talking a lot about the tangible shift in the crypto market. In contrast, a year ago, it felt like everyone was speaking directly to investors, pushing them towards numerous exchange applications and autonomous investing. Now, we’re seeing a focused attempt to empower professionals in the space. Whether it’s tokenized securities, crypto-forward financial products from the world’s largest asset managers, or platforms that help financial advisors access this new market directly, there’s no question that the professionalization of crypto is here.  This is great news for advisors. Not only does it mean broader access to an array of digital assets for clients, but it also means advisors can now build out a new offering in their business, serving clients by giving them what they’re looking for and capturing more assets under management (AUM) along the way. Firms that are equipped with access solutions are set up to thrive. As we’ve clearly seen with the bitcoin ETFs, investor demand for exposure to crypto is palpable, and it’s starting to open the door to the broader world of digital assets for advisors. However, there are a lot of digital assets out there to learn about, and cryptocurrencies are still only estimated at a recommended 1-6% allocation in a portfolio. When you’re managing a book of business that’s 95% traditional market funds, how are you supposed to learn about every coin or every top-mover in a market that moves 24/7?  In the traditional market, there are expert asset managers to do this for you. So why not leverage the same tools for crypto?  Applying the tools you know to the market you don’t know (yet)  Just like in the traditional market, while SMAs are not meant to replace due diligence in practice; they allow advisors to leverage meticulously researched strategies built to cover the best parts of the digital asset market. Let’s break down how RIAs can apply this old tool to the new asset class:  5 ways crypto strategies from asset managers can be useful for advisors  Diversification: Crypto models allow advisors to offer their clients exposure to a diversified portfolio of cryptocurrencies. This diversification can help reduce overall risk by spreading investments across multiple assets with different risk profiles.  Customization: Advisors can tailor crypto models to meet the specific investment goals and risk tolerance of individual clients. They can adjust the portfolio composition based on factors such as market conditions, client preferences, and investment strategies.  Transparency: Many crypto asset managers provide real-time transparency into portfolio holdings and performance. This transparency helps build trust with clients by allowing them to track their investments and understand how their money is being managed.  Professional Management: Advisors can leverage the knowledge and insights of top asset managers to make informed investment decisions on behalf of their clients.  Time savings: Because asset managers provide up-to-the-minute market insights, automatic rebalancing, and thoughtful allocations without the need for hours of research on the advisor's part, they can save a considerable amount of time and let advisors focus on the larger portions of client portfolios.  Making the most of this asset class for clients  I know the saying “your money isn’t working hard enough for you” is cliche at this point, but the truth is that digital asset investing is no exception to the rules of portfolio diversification. Having all of your assets in bitcoin could be considered the same as having all of your funds in one stock. The digital asset market has seasons, meaning sometimes lesser-known cryptocurrencies or altcoins have higher performance than bitcoin or ether. When investors don’t consider a holistic crypto investment strategy, they are neglecting the potential to harness the market in a meaningful way. As a professional, you can now help them make the most of these opportunities by offering access to the larger ecosystem.  Meet demand and build expertise  It’s understandable to feel daunted by the amount of education needed to understand cryptocurrencies truly. Each one has a different purpose and a different value. Through asset manager strategies, you can tackle the market head-on and gain knowledge along the way while still meeting demand and keeping your firm relevant. This market is constantly growing, and leaders in the space, including all of us at Onramp Invest, a Securitize company, are committed to keeping you ahead of the curve.  - Eric Ervin, CEO, Onramp Invest  Ask an Expert  Q. What are the key differences between active and passive crypto investment strategies, and how do they impact risk and potential returns in the volatile cryptocurrency market?  Similar to the traditional markets, active and passive investment strategies in the cryptocurrency market offer contrasting approaches to building and managing a portfolio.  Passive crypto investment strategies involve selecting a portfolio of cryptocurrencies and holding them over a long period, regardless of short-term market fluctuations. Passive strategies can be implemented through buying an ETF or holding a diversified portfolio of cryptocurrencies, whether through the fund or an SMA structure. This approach typically requires minimal ongoing management, low transaction costs and simpler tax implications due to infrequent trading. In a successful passive strategy, the returns are generally close to the respective benchmark. For example, for a bitcoin ETF, the returns should be very close to the buy-and-hold strategy. In crypto markets, there are a lot of short-term price fluctuations, so passive strategies are typically associated with higher volatility and higher drawdowns.  Actively managed crypto strategies aim to generate attractive absolute returns or outperform the market by capitalizing on market inefficiencies and utilizing risk-management practices. Typically, an active approach is associated with constant monitoring and active risk management, higher transaction fees and higher performance and management fees paid to a professional asset manager. However, if implemented successfully, an active approach typically mitigates the volatility and drawdowns of the asset class and achieves higher risk-adjusted returns. There are various types of actively managed strategies which suit different investment objectives and risk-return targets.  In the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, the choice between an active and passive approach can significantly impact the results the investor can achieve.  Q. What types of active investment strategies are out there?  There are numerous actively managed strategies with different risk-return profiles for investors. Some actively managed strategies, such as funding rate arbitrage, basis arbitrage, statistical arbitrage, long-short, and short-term directional strategies, aim to achieve absolute returns. Typically, those are sophisticated strategies, involving various quantitative methods, complex and optimized execution as well as advanced risk-management techniques. These strategies are often not highly correlated with cryptocurrency prices and are able to achieve absolute returns with higher Sharpe ratios and lower drawdowns by monetizing the inefficiencies of the nascent asset class.  Another good example of actively managed strategies is strategies that aim to outperform the benchmark, e.g., bitcoin buy-and-hold strategy or market-cap weighted buy-and-hold strategy. Those strategies typically involve some sort of returns prediction, market-timing, and risk-management framework. If successful, an actively managed approach helps to achieve better risk-adjusted returns compared to the respective passive strategy. For example, a properly executed smart risk-managed exposure to bitcoin helps investors achieve higher returns with lower volatility than holding bitcoin ETFs.  Investors can typically get exposure to a variety of actively managed strategies through fund structures or separately managed accounts on spot or futures markets. Over time, I expect actively managed ETFs will be available for investors.  - Leo Mindyuk, CEO, ML Tech  Keep Reading  Bitcoin’s fourth halving occurred Friday, April 20th, 2024, without a hiccup.

42408368,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaIOMQ,1714058812,Samourai Wallet Charges Raise Existential Questions for Privacy Tech,"The U.S. government has put to rest any doubts that any involvement in or profiting from privacy tools beyond authoring code for crypto mixers is off limits.  Call it an assault on privacy or attack on free speech, but the reality on the ground is that any money that flows into an application designed to mix funds to shield user addresses is being treated as laundered funds, no matter the purpose or destination.  Bitcoin Fog. Tornado Cash. Now Samourai Wallet.  Samourai Wallet was (its servers have been seized) a bitcoin wallet that promised to ""keep your transactions private and your identity masked” through a privacy-preserving service called ""Whirlpool.""  Authorities say the wallet processed over $2 billion in unlawful transactions, including at least $100 million via illegal dark web marketplaces like the Silk Road and Hydra Market. Similar arguments were made about Tornado Cash, when it was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury, which essentially counted every dollar that flowed through it as criminal in nature.  “Together with our law enforcement partners, we will continue to relentlessly pursue and dismantle criminal organizations that use cryptocurrency to hide illicit conduct,"" U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement on Wednesday.  See also: Crypto OG Zooko on State of Digital and Financial Privacy  Op-sec  There is much to say about Samourai Wallet’s co-founders Keonne Rodriguez, 35, and William Lonergan Hill’s, 65, op-sec (i.e. “operational security), or apparent lack thereof. Rodriguez was arrested in Pennsylvania and will be arraigned this week, while the U.S. is still working to extradite Hill from Portugal.  “I don’t know how they thought they wouldn’t get arrested and prosecuted for this. It sounds like the DOJ has direct evidence of them saying they knew they were helping people conceal illegal transactions and charging for the service,” University of Kentucky law professor Brian Frye told CoinDesk in an interview.  The DOJ alleges that Rodriguez and Hill actively solicited criminal customers in their marketing and social media posts. Hill, for instance, reportedly said ""At Samourai we are entirely focused on the censorship resistance and black/grey circular economy. This implies no foreseeable mass adoption,” in an intercepted internal message.  “Ultimately if you’re knowingly facilitating illicit finance and profiting from it, which is alleged in the complaint, the outlook is bleak,” venture capitalist Nic Carter said in a direct message. “Nevertheless it’s disturbing the extent to which the Biden Admin[istration] is attempting to criminalize privacy.”  The Biden Administration has seemingly ramped up efforts to knock down mixing services. That includes arresting Russian-Swedish national, and Bitcoin Fog operator, Roman Sterlingov in April 2021 and participating in the arrest of the co-founders of Tornado Cash in 2023. However, crypto mixers have long been in the sights of criminal prosecutors. In Sterlingov’s case, investigators worked to establish evidence over a period of years.  See also: How a Bitcoin Mixer Laundering Conviction Might Be Appealed  As far back as May 2019, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has been concerned about cryptocurrency “tumblers,” finding that that “persons who accept and transmit value in a way ostensibly designed to protect the privacy of the transmittor [sic] are providers of secure money transmission services and are not eligible for the integral exemption.”  In other words, mixers are money transmitters, even though a person is generally only transmitting funds between two addresses they control to anonymize their funds. And if you’re deemed a money transmitter, FinCEN noted, you’re expected to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act.  “My opinion is that the crypto industry should treat regulation as 'de force majeure' and adjust to it,” Tal Be’ery, co-founder and chief technology officer of the ZenGo wallet, said. [Force majeure is a common legal clause absolving parties from liability.] “The U.S. government made it very clear that operating a mixer is unacceptable with the prosecution of Tornado Cash operators and therefore going after other mixers could be very much expected.”  Privacy dragnet?  Others are concerned that it isn’t just mixing services being targeted, but all privacy-preserving blockchain tech.  “From the cases against Tornado Cash to the IRS 'broker rule' to the arrest of Samourai Wallet's founders, it's clear that the U.S. government is moving aggressively against privacy tools in crypto,” Galaxy Digital head of research Alex Thorn told CoinDesk.  See also: Privacy Isn't Just an Edge Case for Crypto  It’s worth noting that, while Rodriguez and Hill remained active in overseeing the protocol since it launched over a decade ago, the Samourai wallet was non-custodial and open-source. The code was ""self-hosted” on the company’s open source GitLab repository, although the provided link no longer appears to be working. The Samourai apps have also been removed from the Google and Apple app stores, though theoretically the software can be built, run and hosted by anyone.  Some experts contacted by CoinDesk, including Frye, believe that crypto mixers could theoretically be legal to code, but likely not to market or maintain. Releasing software is generally protected by the First Amendment in the United States, because code is a language and language is speech.  “While crypto mixers might in theory be legal, if used only for protecting the privacy of legal transactions, using them to conceal illegal transactions is definitely illegal,” Frye said.  “It's clear that if developers maintain any involvement in privacy tools beyond authoring code – whether that be operating front-ends, facilitating any kind of money movement or taking fees – they will be targeted. For on-chain privacy to succeed in the future, tools must be completely decentralized,” Thorn echoed.  Others, like TradeLayer founder Patrick Dugan, noted that it also matters whether authors of crypto mixer code profit from their inventions. Samourai allegedly earned at least $4.5 million in fees from its wallet and mixer services, according to the indictment.  “The case will ultimately come down to any revenue mechanism the developers may have used that might constitute an operating enterprise in the eyes of prosecutors, making them culpable for money laundering done by proxy,” Dugan said, mentioning that, unlike Tornado Cash, Samourai did not have a token.  Fighting for privacy  Despite the realpolitik of the situation, many in the crypto community see the targeting of crypto mixers as an infringement of the basic human right to privacy.  “The government's seizure of Samurai and the arrest of the folks running it is troubling. It feels more like what an authoritarian regime would do rather than a free country. I think people have a fundamental right to privacy in their financial transactions, whether digital or physical,” crypto sleuth Ogle told CoinDesk in an interview.  “I'm a big fan of privacy services so I have no moral concerns about what was happening,” said one Bitcoin Lightning developer, who asked to remain anonymous in order to discuss the situation more candidly. “But it seems a bit silly on their part. If I understand the situation correctly these are two American citizens who didn't even do that great a job of covering their tracks. So an arrest is pretty unsurprising.”  Others noted that despite the increased heat on privacy services, there will always be demand for these protocols – from legitimate and criminal users.  See also: Privacy-Preserving Payments Shouldn't Be 'Niche', Monero Dev Says  “Given how easy it is to spin up or use another mixer, this doesn't solve the problem of illicit funds being washed,"" Ogle said. ""It just pushes it to another service.” Dugan noted that there are also privacy coins already in circulation for ""for those seeking pure Exit via cryptocurrency privacy,"" though ""it ain't easy."" He added, ""use monero, it's been delisted almost everywhere, so you know it's legit.""  Zooko WIlcox, founder of privacy coin Zcash, told CoinDesk: “It’s legal to create privacy technology in the USA, and we’re going to keep doing it, because privacy and freedom are core parts of American civilization.”  Additional reporting contributed by Cheyenne Ligon and Nikhilesh De.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/04/25/samourai-wallet-charges-raise-existential-questions-for-privacy-tech,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0b3a2095a47adc03090133058e1c5052f847505a-1599x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This drop comes amid growing speculation that the highly anticipated Ethereum ETFs will likely be rejected by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the upcoming May deadline. US Bitcoin ETF Issuers Brace For SEC’s Expected Denial According to a recent Reuters report, various US Bitcoin ETF issuers and firms anticipate the SEC’s denial of their applications to launch ETFs tied to the price of ETH. These expectations have been fueled by “discouraging meetings” between the applicants and the regulatory agency in recent weeks, as disclosed by four individuals familiar with the matter. Related Reading: Stellar The New Star: XLM On Tear As Analyst Predicts $0.47 Price Target Prominent investment firms such as VanEck, ARK Investment Management, and seven other issuers have submitted filings with the SEC to list ETFs that would track the spot price of Ethereum. As the first in line, VanEck’s and ARK’s applications are subject to the SEC’s decisions by May 23 and May 24, respectively. The sources involved in the meetings between Bitcoin ETF issuers and the SEC have reported that the discussions have been primarily “one-sided,” with agency staff not engaging in substantive details about the proposed products. This starkly contrasts the intensive and detailed discussions between issuers and the agency before the SEC’s landmark approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January. The issuers argued during the meetings that the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and Ethereum futures-based ETFs by the SEC in October set a precedent for the spot ETH products. They also made efforts to address potential regulatory concerns. Despite their arguments, the report notes that the SEC staff did not clarify specific concerns or engage in meaningful dialogue, further indicating a possible denial of the requests. Setback For Crypto Industry If these expectations materialize, it would be a setback for the cryptocurrency industry, which had hoped that the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs would pave the way for similar products and contribute to the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. According to Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF analysis at data firm VettaFi, the likely delay in approval or rejection until later in 2024 or beyond has left the regulatory landscape uncertain. While some issuers have expressed their intention to submit additional disclosure paperwork to continue the conversation with the SEC, the overall sentiment indicates a growing belief that the applications will be rejected. VanEck CEO Jan van Eck has already stated that the company’s application will likely be rejected, while ARK Investment Management has yet to comment. Rejected Ethereum ETFs Could Spark Potential Court Battles Several applicants expect the SEC to cite broader issues, such as the nature and depth of statistical data on the underlying ETH market, as reasons for their decision in the event of ETF rejections. Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, which has filed for a spot in Ethereum ETF, believes that the SEC may require more time to observe Ethereum futures and gather additional data. Related Reading: Why Is The Crypto Market Down Today? Key Reasons Explained Industry insiders further speculate that rejecting Ethereum ETFs could potentially lead to legal action, with one source suggesting that the courts may get involved before Ethereum ETFs eventually become a reality. The anticipated rejection has already influenced the price of Ethereum, with Hong Fang, president of the crypto exchange OKX, stating that the cryptocurrency is experiencing downward pressure as market participants factor in the likelihood of a negative outcome. Currently, ETH is trading at $3,100, further highlighting the cryptocurrency’s persistent downtrend over broader time frames. Over the past fourteen and thirty days, the token has experienced significant declines of 12% and 14%, respectively.

The firm was founded by Rushi Manche, 21, and Cooper Scanlon, 24 – Vanderbilt college dropouts who say they are on a mission to ""make blockchain security sexy"" with the launch of Movement L2, their new layer-2 Ethereum blockchain based on the Move programming paradigm.  Manche said he got interested in Move after reading an article a few years ago, when he was still in college, about Facebook's efforts in the blockchain space.  ""Security has never been a priority for the industry,"" Manche said in an interview. ""It's always, like, '$100 million hack,' '$20 million attack' – we're so succumbed and numb to the attack issue when in reality, that's a huge issue for retail.""  Move is today best known for its association with Aptos and Sui, layer-1 blockchains with a focus on low fees and high throughput. By extending the tech to an Ethereum layer-2 – a blockchain that writes data to Ethereum but offers faster and cheaper transactions – the Movement team hopes to achieve greater security and transaction speeds than layer-2 incumbents.  Movement's funding round saw participation from venture capital firms including Hack VC, Placeholder, Archetype, Maven 11, Robot Ventures, Figment Capital, Nomad Capital, Bankless Ventures, OKX Ventures, dao5, and Aptos Labs – the company behind Aptos.  ""Between 2022 and 2023, hackers exploited smart contracts for over $5.4 billion, affecting major protocols like Curve and KyberSwap through common reentrancy attacks,"" Movement explained in a statement. ""Movement’s EVM allows Move and Solidity developers to deploy code that is fully verified at runtime, preventing attack vectors like reentrancy from executing.""  ""With embedded firmware application runtime, we can stop 90% of attack vectors or more,"" Manche told CoinDesk. Move also uses parallelization – a method for processing multiple streams of activity at once that's used by Solana and Move-based chains to achieve greater transaction throughput. ""This combination of speed and security makes for a really powerful VM,"" said Manche.  Move is the stand-out product of Meta's ill-fated foray into blockchain technology. Then still called Facebook, the company made a big splash in 2019 with the announcement that it was launching a cryptocurrency called ""Libra"" (later renamed ""Diem""). Diem's blockchain was supposed to use Move, a new open-source programming language based on Rust that Meta designed to make the entire process of coding up a blockchain more secure and efficient.  ""In August 2022, I was in college with my co-founder at Vanderbilt and I read this article, 'Facebook is building a new programming language,'"" recalled Manche. ""I would use Cosmos and the [Ethereum Virtual Machine], but there weren't a lot of users – wasn't a lot of volume.""  ""To me, it was like, okay, Facebook, the biggest consumer app, they're all trying to get on-chain. They're doing this new initiative, new language, new VM. So I started digging,"" said Manche.  Though Meta's virtual currency plans were ultimately scrapped under regulatory pressure, some of the company's employees jumped ship to found the Move-based blockchain companies Aptos and Sui.  Before discovering Move, Manche says he experimented with crypto in college, mostly in the Cosmos blockchain ecosystem. Cooper was the first of the pair to build using Move – creating a yield aggregator for Aptos.  Barely old enough to drink, Manche says he and his co-founder's ages were initially a big quesion for investors as the pair were navigating the fundraising circuit. ""When we were first starting off, it was like, 'Who are these kids? What are they doing? How can we trust them?,'"" said Manche.  ""I think over time, especially me and Cooper, we've built a lot of trust up because we're category leaders. We showed a lot of traction in terms of development, traction in terms of the community ecosystem,"" said Manche. ""The age question was always a sticking point, but I think now everyone's pretty bullish.""  Aptos and Sui were the first to put Move to the test in the real world, and Movement Labs is the first to bring Meta's Move tech to a layer-2 network on Ethereum. The network will support programs developed using Move or Solidity, Ethereum's native programming language.  In addition to the Movement L2, the company is introducing the Move Stack – a blockchain execution environment that can be used to build other chains and has been designed for compatibility with popular blockchain-building frameworks such as the OP Stack and Arbitrum Orbit. It's also building a shared sequencer, meaning the method it uses to communicate between the L1 and L2 chains will have elements of decentralization.  Movement L2 will be ""one of the first main flagship L2s prioritizing decentralization and decentralized sequencers"" from the start, said Manche.  The Movement L2 will enter its testnet phase this summer.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | APT | ARB,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/04/25/movement-labs-raises-38m-for-rollup-based-on-facebooks-move-language,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f3f0cfee8f1f06171ffa020b5d826d65a44274c6-2143x1277.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The U.S. government's preliminary report for first quarter GDP showed growth of just 1.6%, substantially lower than the 2.5% analysts estimated and down from 3.4% in the fourth quarter of 2023. Meanwhile, the GDP price index came in slightly hotter than expected at 3.1% and up from 1.6% in the previous quarter.  The disappointing inflation data report spooked investors, with hopes for interest rate cuts this year dimming further, hitting risk assets across all markets. Major U.S. stock indexes such as the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq began the trading session down nearly 2%, while the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yield jumped 8 basis points to 4.73%, its highest reading since November.

42408386,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaIPGd,1714054248,The FTC’s Non-Compete Ban Is Good for the Crypto Industry,"When I read about the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s new rule banning non-compete agreements, I was reminded of when I left a blockchain startup a few years ago to join another early-venture company. My old employer sent me a cease-and-desist letter stating that I had breached a non-compete clause in my old employment contract.  There was little legal merit to their arguments. The non-compete clause was overly-broad and would probably have been unenforceable in court. The companies’ markets and products were distinctly different, and I was not a software engineer but a lawyer – a profession that is generally not subject to non-competes.  Linda Jeng is the Founder & CEO of Digital Self Labs, a blockchain advisory firm.  Nonetheless, this led to a protracted ordeal that kept me from working for many months. I lost over $80,000 in income, used up my savings, and bore the legal costs of hiring an employment attorney. But, worse than the financial costs, was the emotional distress.  I was fortunate that my new employer stood by me. Not everyone in my situation is so lucky. On their end, they shouldered the costs of hiring legal counsel and time spent negotiating with my old employer. More importantly, they lost months of what would have been my contribution to the company. The ordeal ended when my new employer realized that this was probably a delay tactic on the part of my old employer, which had rejected reasonable financial offers to settle.  The federal and local government were also losing parties. They lost tax revenue from my months of unemployment. In the third month, I had even begun the paperwork for unemployment benefits. Other losing parties include the venture capital investors whose funds were being deployed to handle the matter rather than on developing products and going to market.  I have never publicly written about these events. It was perhaps the most stressful period of my 20 year career. There are few statistics on how non-competes are used against departing employees, but I know I’m not alone.Nearly one in five Americans are subject to non-competes, and a 2023 US Government Accountability Officesurvey of 247 employers found that only 39% responded that they have never tried to formally or informally enforce a non-compete agreement. FTC chair Lina M. Khan says the new rule, once enacted, will create 8,500 new startups through greater competition.  I work in the blockchain and digital assets industry. Looking back, I see the irony that a blockchain startup violated the foundational principle of our innovative industry’s open-source ethos. Another irony was that the CEO was based in the State of California, which has not enforced a non-compete since 1872. Imagine what Silicon Valley would be today if California had been banning non-compete agreements all along.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Linda Jeng,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/04/25/the-ftcs-non-compete-ban-is-good-for-the-crypto-industry,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e0e3ca317c8c51a46068c5cb413b37f06129425c-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

HBAR Token Crashes By Almost 35% Data from CoinGecko shows that the HBAR token has declined by almost 35% since its price rose by over 100% on the back of the announcement, which many misinterpreted to mean that BlackRock tokenized its fund on the Hedera network. On April 24, the Hedera Foundation shared that Blockchain trading firm Archax and Infrastructure firm Ownera had collaborated to tokenize BlackRock’s ICS US Treasury money market fund (MMF) on Hedera. Related Reading: XRP Price Ready For 70% Breakout As Long-Term Consolidation Nears Its End Members of the crypto community, including influencers like CrediBULL Crypto and Mason Versluis, misconstrued this as meaning that BlackRock had tokenized its fund on Hedera. This assumption immediately created a bullish narrative for the ecosystem, leading to HBAR’s price rallying by over 100% and peaking at $0.176. However, the crypto token has since been on a downtrend, with BlackRock denying any involvement with Hedera. Specifically, a BlackRock spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the world’s largest asset manager “has no commercial relationship with Hedera nor has BlackRock selected Hedera to tokenize any BlackRock funds.” Meanwhile, Archax’s co-founder had also clarified on his X (formerly Twitter) platform that BlackRock wasn’t directly involved in the whole move. He claimed that tokenization of the fund can usually be done without the permission of the asset manager. However, he revealed that BlackRock knew they were tokenizing on the network. Why The News Is Still Bullish For The Hedera Ecosystem Despite BlackRock not being directly involved in this development, crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto offered some perspective on why this news is still bullish for Hedera and its HBAR token. He revealed that BlackRock is the fourth largest shareholder of ABRDN, a firm that is a primary investor in Archax. Related Reading: Brace For Impact: Worldcoin Team Plans To Sell 1.5 Million WLD Tokens Every Week For 6 Months Therefore, the crypto analyst believes that BlackRock must have signed off on this move, something he considers a “de-facto endorsement of the product.” Meanwhile, he also alluded to an interview that revealed that BlackRock chose Hedera, although ABRDN introduced them to the network. CrediBULL Crypto noted that even if BlackRock wasn’t building on the network, it is clear that “major enterprises are using Hedera.” They are “actively involved with building on the network and are constantly pushing to move it forward behind the scenes,” he added. He suggested that this puts Hedera above 99% of networks that can’t boast of such achievements.

Core is not selling shares and management has been buying while their competitors do the opposite. Emerging from bankruptcy, CORZ hasn’t gotten the uplift of large institutional ETF inclusion yet. Insider buy timing is indicative of the nearing tail of post-bankruptcy holder selling. Disclaimer / Disclosure Everyone should own at least some Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). What’s the right amount? 0% is too little. 100% is too much. For over a decade, my answer has been 10%. Should you buy or mine? I’ve done both. I participated in multiple government auctions for Bitcoin starting ten years ago and have continuously owned it both directly and indirectly up to today. While I’ve both purchased and mined it, my preference has largely been to simply buy it. I particularly liked buying crypto before various cryptocurrencies were added to convenient exchanges such as Coinbase ( COIN ), when they tended to get more expensive, and again when they were offered in spot ETFs such as Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ETF ( FBTC ). But that’s changed today. Today, there’s a single miner that offers more leverage to Bitcoin’s upside. I’m confident that Bitcoin will double from here at least once more. If it does, I don’t want to be just in Bitcoin – more than anything else, I want to be in Core Scientific, Inc. ( CORZ ). If Bitcoin doubles once more, then Core will likely (far) more than double. But there are a lot of catalysts that could benefit this stock even without a big BTC move. It is likely to get added to the Russell 2000 ( IWM ) and will get a big impact from index fund buyers. It is the largest public BTC miner, yet trades at a fraction of the value of peers such as Marathon ( MARA ) and Riot ( RIOT ): TheMinerMag Virtually all of these miners talk about getting into high-performance computing; Core is the only one who’s successfully done so . This speaks well to the quality of their team, the value of their assets, and offers a bit of diversification. Core is leveraged to the price of Bitcoin and should get the best returns in a Bitcoin bull market, especially as it isn't joining its competitors in diluting shareholders. No public competitor mined more in 2021, 2022, 2023, or so far, in 2024. Caveat Leverage works both ways; if Bitcoin crashes, then so will Core. Conclusion My conclusion is that Core is the best positioned cryptocurrency investment coming out of the halving.

Those chains include Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, StarkWare and zkSync. Users will be able to opt in or out to use Avail for data availability – a service needed by these ""rollup networks"" to stash the reams of data produced on all the transactions taking place. A key driver for DA solutions is that they can provide a cheaper and faster way of storing data than on the main Ethereum blockchain.  Avail came into the limelight alongside other DA projects, which have gained buzz over the past few months with protocols like Celestia that went live in October, and Eigenlayer’s EigenDA that went live earlier this month. Avail’s DA is still in testnet, but is expected to go live very soon, according to Anurag Arjun, the co-founder of Avail.  Avail last week released its plan for a token airdrop, and one of the groups that will be eligible for the AVAIL token are users of these rollups.  In February, Avail announced that it would be coming out with two more core products: Nexus, a layer that connects different rollups to each other through the Avail ecosystem (similar to Polygon’s AggLayer), and Avail Fusion, which will borrow the security of crypto assets like ether (ETH) or bitcoin (BTC) and contribute them to Avail’s security (similar to EigenLayer).  “DA is more production ready, because DA is going out soon,"" Arjun said in an interview with CoinDesk.

42408374,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaIOgG,1714049298,MicroStrategy Could Merit S&P 500 Inclusion If It Adopts New Accounting Rules: Benchmark,"MicroStrategy could boost earnings by over $3 billion if it chooses to adopt new standards, the report said.  Benchmark said if the company reports positive earnings it meets the final condition for S&P 500 inclusion.  This would boost MicroStrategy’s valuation as index funds would be forced to buy the stock, the broker said.  MicroStrategy (MSTR) could surprise Wall Street analysts and report better-than-expected earnings if the software company chooses to adopt new accounting standards, a move that means it could qualify for inclusion in America’s most important stock index, the S&P 500, broker Benchmark said in a research report on Thursday.  The company will report results for the first quarter 2024 after the close of markets on April 29.  MicroStrategy’s corporate strategy is partly based on the acquisition and holding of bitcoin. As of March 19 it held 214,246 bitcoin worth $13.9 billion at current prices. Benchmark notes that since the software company started holding bitcoin on its balance sheet it has recorded $2.27 billion in cumulative impairment losses due to a Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) rule called ASC 350.  The FASB issued new guidance in December last year that allows companies that hold digital assets on their balance sheet to measure them at fair value, and record changes in fair value in net income in each reporting period. The new rules become effective as of Jan. 1, 2025, but early adoption of the standard is allowed.  “The impact of doing so on MSTR’s reported earnings per share would be massive: the company in its 2023 10-K report estimated that early adoption would increase its 2024 beginning retained earnings balance by ~$3.1 billion,” analyst Mark Palmer wrote.  Analyst consensus is for MicroStrategy to report a first-quarter 2024 loss per share of $0.55. Benchmark estimates that if the company decides to opt for early adoption of the new standard it could report a gain of more than $300 per share for the quarter.  MicroStrategy currently meets nearly all of the criteria for S&P 500 inclusion, the report said. The company is based in the U.S., its shares are highly liquid, 50% of its outstanding shares are available for trading, and its market cap is greater than $18 billion.  For the index committee to consider a stock for inclusion in the S&P 500 it must also report positive earnings in its most recent quarter. Benchmark notes that MicroStrategy has reported losses in 10 of the past 14 quarters. Early adoption of the new standards means the software company could meet this final criterion.  “Inclusion in the S&P 500 would position MSTR’s stock valuation to receive an ongoing boost from the price-agnostic purchases of its shares resulting from enormous passive inflows,” Palmer wrote.  Still, uncertainty around the tax impact of adopting the FASB’s updated guidance could cause MicroStrategy to hold off on early adoption, the report added  Read more: MicroStrategy Should Continue to Rally as Bitcoin Halving Nears: Benchmark",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Will Canny,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/04/25/microstrategy-could-merit-sp-500-inclusion-if-it-adopts-new-accounting-rules-benchmark,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3f16b493932ec7b4961edca09eb32efb52e73c68-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

26355993,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=605058,1714048217,Why Is The Crypto Market Down Today? Key Reasons Explained,"The crypto market is in the red today, with a majority of the top-100 cryptocurrencies reflecting losses over the last 24 hours. Notably, only six altcoins, including two stablecoins, have managed to maintain a positive performance amidst a broader market sell-off. Several complex and intertwined factors have contributed to the day’s negative market sentiment, affecting major cryptocurrencies. Over the last 24 hours, the price of Bitcoin has decreased by 4.2%, Ethereum has fallen by 5.0%, Solana has dropped by 8.7%, XRP has declined by 4.7%, and Dogecoin has decreased by 8.3%. #1 Persistent Macroeconomic Uncertainty A primary factor influencing today’s market movements is the evolving macroeconomic landscape, particularly concerning US interest rates and inflation expectations. At the beginning of the year, the market anticipated aggressive monetary easing by the Federal Reserve. However, the sentiment has shifted considerably based on recent data and Federal Reserve signals. “Markets are pricing in fewer rate cuts for this year compared to the Fed’s dot plot projection of 3 rate cuts by year end. The implied fed funds rate for December has risen to 5.0%, indicating that the futures market is pricing in only 1 to 2 rate cuts,” Cetera Investment Management stated via X (formerly Twitter). This week, all eyes are on the release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index for March—the Fed’s favored inflation measure on Friday, April 26 at 8:30 am EDT. Until then, the market could be in a derisk mode. Related Reading: How To Outperform In Crypto: Arthur Hayes’ ‘Left Curve’ Strategy The PCE is anticipated to present a varied view of inflation trends, which could strengthen the Federal Reserve’s inclination to delay any increases in interest rates. Analysts predict a slight increase in the overall PCE Price Index, rising to 2.6% year-over-year from 2.5% in February. Additionally, they expect a decrease in the index’s month-over-month change, dropping to 0.30% from 0.33%. #2 Crypto Market In Shock Over Legal Action Against Samourai Wallet The crypto market has also been rocked by yesterday’s legal developments involving the Samourai Wallet. The US Federal prosecutors’ decision to charge the founders Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill with money laundering and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business has sent ripples through the crypto community. This action underscores the ongoing regulatory scrutiny within the crypto space. The prosecution of Samourai Wallet’s founders not only raises questions about the future of cryptographic privacy but also significantly impacts market sentiment as it underscores the legal risks inherent in the crypto sector. The implications of this case extend beyond the immediate legal concerns, influencing broader market perceptions and investor confidence. #3 Bitcoin And Crypto Are “Just Ranging” Further insights into market dynamics come from prominent crypto analysts who have commented on the state of market liquidity and trader behavior. “The market has gifted us with a beautiful reset in trader positioning for Bitcoin. OI weighted funding turned negative for the first time since October 2023. That was before Bitcoin ran from 27k to 46k without any meaningful dip,” said Ted, a crypto analyst on X. This reset refers to a reduction in the overheated futures market, which could allow the market to consolidate and potentially build a base for future upward movements.

On the bright side, despite this slowdown, there have been no outflows from either BlackRock or Fidelity. Grayscale’s GBTC remains the primary negative factor driving outflows. Furthermore, there seems to be a decrease in investment willingness among traditional sector investors; the total inflows through ETFs have been stagnant for more than 30 days, coinciding with a flat trend in Bitcoin prices.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value, has dropped 4% over the last 24 hours to less than $64,000. Ether also saw a significant downside, losing 6%, and the CoinDesk 20 Index, a measure of the broader crypto market, lost 6% as well. Reuters reported that U.S. issuers expect the Securities and Exchange Commission to deny their applications to launch spot ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) after discouraging meetings with the agency in recent weeks.In traditional markets, tech stocks declined after Meta failed to live up to high expectations for its first-quarter earnings report.  BlackRock’s spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), which trades under the ticker IBIT on Nasdaq, fell out of favor on Wednesday, preliminary data published by Farside Investors showed. For the first time since going live on Jan. 11, the fund did not draw any investor money, snapping a 71-day inflows streak. Seven of the other 10 funds followed IBIT’s lead. Fidelity’s FBTC and the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) registered inflows of $5.6 million and $4.2 million, respectively, while Grayscale’s GBTC bled $130.4 million, leading to a net cumulative outflow of $120.6 million, the highest since April 17.  U.S. House Representative Maxine Waters (D-California) indicated that the final version of a stablecoin bill could be ready soon. ""We are on our way to getting a stablecoin bill in the short run,” the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee told Bloomberg on Wednesday. Waters has previously called a version of the stablecoin bill “deeply problematic and bad for America."" “It’s about making sure investors and that the people are protected,” Waters told Bloomberg. “We have to ensure that they have those assets to back up stablecoins,” she said. The latest development strengthens hopes that the U.S. can get a new stablecoin law before the elections this year, which was considered a longshot at the start of the year.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows CryptoQuant's Coinbase premium index, which tracks the spread between bitcoin’s prices on the Nasdaq-listed Coinbase (COIN) exchange and the offshore giant Binance.  The indicator shows bitcoin is again trading at a discount on Coinbase, reflecting a weaker net buying pressure from U.S. investors.  Source: CryptoQuant.

42408388,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaIPNF,1714045521,"Stablecoins, U.S. Government Debt More Important Than Bitcoin ETF Inflows,  Crypto Analysts Says","Potential slowdown in stablecoin inflows and de-inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve could breed downside volatility in bitcoin.  Dips in risk assets are likely to be well supported ahead of the U.S. elections, one observer said.  While the crypto community continues to obsess about the daily flows into the U.S.-listed spot bitcoin {{BTC}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs), some market observers are focusing on stablecoins and shenanigans in the U.S. government bond market.  ""Stablecoin inflows have been a pillar of strength for the crypto market. While most have focused on the ETF inflows, stablecoin inflows have been a more meaningful driver and have kept crypto prices high,"" Thielen told CoinDesk in an interview.  ""If stablecoins inflows slow down, then we could see a meaningful correction,"" Thielen added.  Over the years, stablecoins, or tokens with values pegged to an external reference like the U.S. dollar, have been widely used to fund cryptocurrency purchases and derivatives trading. Hence, the supply of stablecoins is widely seen as a proxy for net capital inflows into the crypto market.  The capital has flown into the crypto market via stablecoins at a faster pace than spot ETFs. That's evident from the fact that the combined market capitalization of the top two stablecoins, tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), has increased by $25.6 billion to a record $143.8 billion since the spot ETFs began trading in the U.S. on Jan. 11. Meanwhile, the ETFs have amassed over $12 billion since going live on Nasdaq, according to data tracked by 10x Research.  The chart shows that while inflows into the spot ETFs have slowed in recent weeks, the supply of the top two stablecoins has continued to expand, keeping prices elevated between $60,000 and $70,000.  Another source of potential downside volatility could be the ""de-inversion"" of the U.S. Treasury curve, according to Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex Solutions.  The yield curve, or the term structure of interest rates, shows the yield on bonds with different terms to maturity. Normally, the curve is upward-sloping as investors demand a higher yield for investing or lending money to the government over long periods.  Nearly two years ago, the curve inverted, with the two-year note offering a higher yield than the 10-year note as the Federal Reserve rapidly raised interest rates.  Now, the curve is de-inverting, led by a faster rise in the 20-year yield (also called bear steepening). As of writing, the spread between the 10- and two-year yields stood at -0.28 basis points, the least since January. In other words, the curve is just 28 bps short of normalizing.  ""There's always nuance interpreting the curve, but take at face value, it [bear steepening] can imply loss of confidence in either fiscal or monetary policy – or both. For example, it could mean markets see a greater risk the Fed is falling behind the curve or borrowing is becoming unhinged without corresponding demand,"" Solot told CoinDesk.  ""That's not a good environment for risk in general, and, at least initially, should weigh on the crypto market as well,"" Solot added, saying the dip would be an opportunity for bitcoin to prove it is a hedge against fiscal and monetary instability.  The chart shows the spread between the 10- and two-year yields since 1980, with vertical shaded area representing economic recessions or consecutive quarterly contracts in the growth rate.  Historically, de-inversions have marked the onset of economic recessions and risk aversion in stocks.  According to Phillip Gillespie, managing partner at U.K.-based hedge fund AWR Capital, ultimately, risk assets will find their footing as long as the Federal Reserve continues to support the system with the overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) agreement facility.  The overnight RRP is the Fed's tool to remove excess cash from the money market. Since early last year, the RRPP facility has been drained, meaning the once dormant cash is being redeployed, supporting risk-taking in financial markets.  ""The Fed is continuing to support the market via overnight reverse repo facility, and although sticky inflation is a problem, there are now even talks of rate cuts given ballooning fiscal deficits and pressure from the government to curb the cost of financing its debts. Risk assets will oscillate here and there with geopolitical flare-ups or upticks in yields, but, in general, risk assets and crypto should be well supported for this year ahead of U.S. elections,"" Gillespie told CoinDesk.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/25/stablecoins-us-government-debt-more-important-than-etf-inflows-crypto-analysts-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6923046d9a52fac72269f7dd0d26ff84da658711-3240x1823.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42408371,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaIOZe,1714030295,Stablecoin Bill Could Be Ready for the U.S. House Soon Says Top Democrat Maxine Waters: Bloomberg,"The top Democrat on the U.S. House Financial Services Committee has told Bloomberg that a stablecoin bill could be ready soon.  The latest development strengthens hopes that the U.S. can get a new stablecoin law this year, before the elections, considered a longshot at the start of the year.  U.S. House Representative Maxine Waters (D-California) indicated that the final version of the stablecoin bill could be ready soon. ""We are on our way to getting a stablecoin bill in the short run,” the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee told Bloomberg on Wednesday.  Waters has previously called a version of the stablecoin bill “deeply problematic and bad for America.""  “It’s about making sure investors and that the people are protected,” Waters told Bloomberg. “We have to ensure that they have those assets to back up stablecoins,” she said.  The latest development strengthens hopes that the U.S. can get a new stablecoin law before the elections this year, which was considered a longshot at the start of the year.  Congressional movement, both in the Senate and the House, on stablecoin legislation picked up pace in the past few weeks. Waters said that the U.S. Federal Reserve, the Treasury Department and the White House have all had input in crafting the bill, the report said.  Waters and House Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), who have been negotiating for 22 months, reportedly met with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to get the legislation moving by tying it to a must-pass Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization due next month.  Last week, in the Senate, U.S. Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) introduced a new stablecoin bill, which proposed a ban on algorithmic stablecoins and required tokens of issuers to be fully backed by reserve assets.  Waters also told Bloomberg that she has discussed stablecoins with the Senate Banking Chairman Sherrod Brown. Earlier this month, Brown told Bloomberg he was open to advancing the stablecoins legislation.  A marijuana banking bill could also be paired with the stablecoin legislation. Brown’s committee has advanced the marijuana legislation but it could face opposition from Republican leader Mitch McConnell. However, Waters said she was hopeful of overcoming that resistance if it were to come.  In March, McHenry said the stablecoin bill is largely worked out in the Republican-controlled House and just needs a scheduled floor vote.

26346191,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=605030,1714030226,Head And Shoulders Alert: Dogecoin Could See A Price Crash Soon,"Crypto analysts are sounding the alarm on Dogecoin as a classic chart pattern, known for predicting bearish trends, has emerged. Technical analyst Josh Olszewicz, @CarpeNoctom, flagged a potential Head and Shoulders (H&S) formation on the DOGE/USD 12-hour chart on X, hinting at a possible significant price drop if the pattern validates. The H&S pattern is a technical indicator traditionally viewed as a bearish signal within the trading community. The pattern is composed of three peaks, with the central peak (the head) being the highest and the two outside peaks (the shoulders) being lower and approximately equal in height. The line connecting the lowest points of the two troughs (the neckline) can be horizontal or sloped and represents a critical support level. Dogecoin Must Hold $0.14 In the case of Dogecoin’s 12-hour chart, the price has completed the left shoulder and the head, with the right shoulder currently forming. The neckline of this H&S pattern is identified at approximately $0.14, as annotated by Olszewicz. This level is crucial; a decisive break below could confirm the bearish forecast suggested by the H&S formation. Another technical detail present on the chart is the Fibonacci retracement levels, which are horizontal lines indicating where support and resistance are likely to occur. They are based on Fibonacci numbers, a sequence famous in mathematics and nature for its proportionality. Related Reading: Expert Forecasts 700% Growth For Dogecoin (DOGE) As It Sets Sights On $1 Target Here, the 0.5 Fibonacci level aligns with the left shoulder around $0.18, while the 0 level coincides with the peak at approximately $0.23. These levels are key to determining the potential support and resistance areas in the market. Olszewicz has also highlighted a projected target area based on the H&S pattern’s typical behavior. This bearish target is identified using the height of the pattern from the head’s peak to the neckline, projected downward from the point of the neckline break. The target box, marked in green, shows a potential decline to $0.10 to $0.09, coinciding with the 1.618 and 2.0 Fibonacci extension levels. A fall to this level could lead to a price crash of 40%. The importance of the H&S pattern lies in its reliability as a trend reversal signal. It validates when the price breaks below the neckline following the formation of the right shoulder. For traders and investors alike, this pattern serves as a cautionary tale to brace for potential downside risks. Related Reading: Dogecoin To $1: Analyst Thinks Dream Milestone Could Be Hit In Coming Weeks As of the latest chart by Olszewicz, the neckline has not been breached, and the pattern has yet to be confirmed. It is critical for observers to watch the $0.14 level closely, as a break below it would likely activate a sell-off, fulfilling the H&S prophecy. However, until such a break occurs, the pattern remains a watchful indicator rather than a confirmed trend reversal. In summary, Dogecoin’s price chart is showing signs that could concern bullish investors. If history is any guide, the emerging H&S pattern, closely watched by analysts like Olszewicz, suggests a possible downward move in Dogecoin’s value in the near future. However, only a decisive break below the neckline will validate this pattern, turning a watchful eye into a bearish outlook. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.1509.

Morgan Stanley could become the first among its peers to allow bitcoin ETF solicitation.  The move could push substantial inflow into the ETFs.  Morgan Stanley (MS) is looking to allow its 15,000 brokers to recommend bitcoin {{BTC}} exchange-traded funds (ETF) to their customers, according to a report from AdvisorHub.  The Wall Street giant opened up bitcoin ETF purchases after they had been approved earlier this year. However, this was done only on an unsolicited basis. The bank is now looking to let its brokers pitch bitcoin ETFs directly to its customers, the report added.  The move is a testament to the demand for the spot ETFs and could bring additional inflows into the funds. The ETFs allow the customers to reap the benefits of investing in the oldest cryptocurrency without direct exposure.  “We’re going to make sure that we’re very careful about it...we are going to make sure everybody has access to it. We just want to do it in a controlled way,” AdvisorHub reported, citing a Morgan Stanley executive.  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 11 spot bitcoin ETFs in January. The firms that got the approval include investment behemoths BlackRock (BK), Fidelity, Invesco (IVZ) and others.  The approval brought massive inflows into the funds and, subsequently, bitcoin. However, the inflows have been dwindling for some time, with BlackRock registering zero daily inflow for its ETF for the first time ever on Wednesday, according to Farside.  Morgan Stanley allowing its brokers to recommend bitcoin ETFs could bring back momentum into the funds.  Morgan Stanley declined to comment on the report.

26344055,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=605017,1714026176,Negative Nirvana? Decoding The First Bitcoin Funding Rate Dip Of 2024,"The recent Bitcoin halving event, which cut the block reward for miners in half on April 20, 2024, has sparked a wave of optimism in the cryptocurrency market. While a brief dip in a key futures metric hinted at potential short-term bearishness, overall market indicators suggest a bullish trend taking hold. Related Reading: Solana Meme Coin Massacre: 12 Projects Gone In 30 Days, $27 Million Vanished Analysts at Kaiko, a market data provider specializing in crypto derivatives and futures, reported a shift in Bitcoin’s funding rate leading up to the halving. The funding rate is a fee paid between long and short position holders in futures contracts. A negative rate signifies that short positions are compensating long positions, potentially indicating a bearish outlook. Notably, Bitcoin’s funding rate dipped into negative territory for the first time this year on April 18th, just two days before the halving. Bitcoin Bounces Back With Renewed Bullishness However, this short-lived bearishness seems to have been overshadowed by a broader sense of optimism. Following the halving, Bitcoin’s funding rate swiftly recovered and currently sits at a positive 0.0051. This suggests a return to the status quo where long positions are incentivized, reflecting a more bullish market sentiment. Funding rates for $BTC perps turned negative for the first time since late 2023 in the lead up to the halving. pic.twitter.com/MjiU4C1L5m — Kaiko (@KaikoData) April 24, 2024 Further bolstering this positive outlook is the uptick in Bitcoin’s Open Interest (OI), a metric that represents the total amount of outstanding futures contracts. Despite a dip last week, OI has since rebounded to over $17 billion, indicating continued investor engagement in the Bitcoin market. Bitcoin is now trading at 64.250. Chart: TradingView Halving Impact Exceeds Historical Trends Perhaps the most intriguing finding from Kaiko’s analysis is the suggestion that this halving event might be having a more positive impact on Bitcoin’s price compared to previous halvings. At the time of the report, Bitcoin was up 2.8% since the halving, exceeding the price increases observed immediately after the 2012, 2016, and 2020 halving events. Despite a slight price correction in the following days, Bitcoin remains nearly 3% up since the halving. Related Reading: Solana Market Cap Skyrockets $11 Billion As Price Jumps 17% – Details However, analysts caution against drawing definitive conclusions from this initial data. The cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile, and short-term fluctuations are to be expected. Some experts point to historical trends where price increases following a halving event were often followed by periods of consolidation or correction. The true impact of the halving on Bitcoin’s long-term price trajectory might not be fully evident for several months. Bullish Sentiment Fueled By Macroeconomic Factors Beyond technical indicators, some analysts believe that broader macroeconomic factors are also contributing to the current bullish sentiment surrounding Bitcoin. The ongoing global inflationary pressures and geopolitical uncertainties have driven investors towards assets perceived as hedges against inflation. Bitcoin, with its finite supply due to the halving mechanism, fits this profile for some investors. Additionally, the increasing institutional adoption of cryptocurrency is seen as a positive sign for Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. Major financial institutions are actively exploring ways to offer Bitcoin exposure to their clients, suggesting a growing level of confidence in the asset class.

In exchange, Bankman-Fried has agreed to cooperate with the plaintiffs in the ongoing lawsuits against other defendants related to the collapse of FTX. Sam Bankman-Fried And Insiders Settle Per the report, if approved by a judge, this agreement would release Bankman-Fried from civil liability just weeks after being sentenced to 25 years in prison for fraud stemming from allegations of stealing billions of dollars from FTX. The settlement, filed in federal court in Miami, stipulates that the plaintiffs in the multi-district litigation will resolve all current and future claims against Bankman-Fried. Related Reading: Newbie Bitcoin Whales Hold 2x As Much As Veterans: What’s Behind This Trend? Other FTX insiders, including former executives Gary Wang, Caroline Ellison, and Nishad Singh, who testified against Bankman-Fried, were also sued by investors. However, they have agreed to settle and have already started providing information to support the plaintiff’s case, as stated in the court filing. Notably, this leaves the high-profile celebrities, sports stars, and social media influencers who promoted FTX to investors and customers as the remaining defendants. As part of the settlement agreement, Bankman-Fried has committed to assisting the plaintiffs’ lawyers in pursuing the remaining FTX endorsers. Additionally, he will provide all nonprivileged documents related to his assets and his investment in artificial intelligence start-up Anthropic. Bankman-Fried will also submit an affidavit certifying his net worth as negative and share documents about other defendants involved in the expansive civil litigation. The list of defendants in the consolidated FTX lawsuits is extensive, with financiers and celebrity endorsers such as Tom Brady, Shaquille O’Neal, and Gisele Bundchen accused of promoting “unregistered securities” and luring investors into a Ponzi scheme. Bankman-Fried’s agreement includes providing any relevant information about venture capital firms that invested in FTX and accountants and lawyers who worked with the exchange. If successful, the plaintiffs could potentially win substantial amounts in damages. According to court filings, the settlements with the promoters involved in the agreement are estimated to be valued at around $1.3 million. FTX Scandal Update Bankman-Fried’s spokesperson, Mark Botnick, stated that his client is determined to make amends. Botnick emphasized that since the collapse of FTX, Bankman-Fried has focused solely on returning the estate’s assets to customers and ensuring they are made whole at current prices. Botnick expressed Bankman-Fried’s commitment to continue working with Adam Moskowitz and his team, representing the plaintiffs, to achieve this goal. In their request for the judge’s approval of the settlement, the plaintiffs’ attorneys acknowledged the uncertainty and litigation risks associated with pursuing Bankman-Fried. They concluded that Bankman-Fried’s cooperation would be “valuable” in the remaining legal proceedings.

26337696,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=604938,1714014033,"Bitcoin Whales Continue Buying, Now Hold 25.16% Of All Supply","On-chain data shows that the Bitcoin whales’ holdings have grown to 25.16% of the entire supply, and their net accumulation has continued recently. Bitcoin Investors With 1,000 To 10,000 BTC Have Continued To Buy Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the BTC whales have accumulated more than 266,000 BTC since the start of the year. The indicator of interest here is the “Supply Distribution,” which keeps track of the percentage of the total circulating Bitcoin supply that the various wallet groups are holding right now. The addresses are divided into these cohorts based on the number of coins they currently have in their balance. The 10 to 100 coins group, for example, includes all wallets that own at least 10 and, at most, 100 BTC. Related Reading: Newbie Bitcoin Whales Hold 2x As Much As Veterans: What’s Behind This Trend? The Supply Distribution sums up the amount that investors belonging to a particular group as a whole are carrying and calculates what percentage of the supply they contribute. The 1,000 to 10,000 BTC cohort is of interest in the current discussion. At the current exchange rate, the lower limit for this cohort is $65 million, while the upper one is $650 million. Clearly, the investors belonging to the group are quite massive, and as such, they are popularly known as “whales.” As the whales can quickly move large amounts, they have the potential to influence the market. Due to this, their behavior can be worth watching. There are whales beyond this cohort’s 10,000 BTC upper limit as well, but at such massive scales, entities like exchanges also start coming into play, who aren’t exactly normal investors. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Supply Distribution for the 1,000 to 10,000 coins group over the last few months: The value of the metric seems to have observed a spike in recent days | Source: Santiment on X As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Supply Distribution for this key investor group has observed a net rise over the year 2024 so far. The whales have bought 266,000 BTC ($17.2 billion) over this period. However, this accumulation hasn’t been consistent. As is visible in the chart, the whales sold into the rally that would eventually lead to the asset’s new all-time high, and they bought back in once the drawdown was over. As BTC has consolidated, so has its supply. Still, the latest change in the metric has been towards the upside, implying that these humongous holders are perhaps backing the current recovery push. Following the latest accumulation, the 1,000 to 10,000 coins group holds 25.16% of the supply, which means that more than a quarter of all Bitcoin in circulation is sitting in the wallets of these large investors. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Top Already Here? This Historical Pattern Says So While whale buying is bullish, the current investor sentiment may not be so. As the data for the “Weighted Sentiment” metric attached by Santiment in the chart suggests, investors are currently showing FOMO towards the asset. Historically, Bitcoin has tended to move against the majority’s expectations, so FUD/fear has been ideal for uptrends to start. FOMO/greed, on the other hand, has been where tops have become probable. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $64,700, up more than 7% over the past week.

Starting from a low of $0.0875, HBAR skyrocketed to reach the $0.1821 mark by Wednesday. The sudden surge was triggered by the news of BlackRock’s tokenized fund, BUIDL, which generated high expectations among HBAR investors regarding a potential collaboration between the prominent asset manager and the Hedera protocol. Not Directly Connected To Hedera? Launched by BlackRock in March 2024, BUIDL operates as a tokenized fund on the Ethereum blockchain, providing US dollar yields through tokenization. Related Reading: Newbie Bitcoin Whales Hold 2x As Much As Veterans: What’s Behind This Trend? Initially, an announcement led to confusion among investors, who mistakenly believed that BlackRock would directly tokenize the fund on the Hedera network. This misunderstanding triggered a significant surge in the HBAR price. Upon closer examination of the announcement, it became clear that BlackRock and Hedera had no direct connection, although the initial reaction to the news was noteworthy. Crypto analysts, who use the pseudonym “CrediBull” on social media site X (formerly Twitter), shed light on the situation, emphasizing that explicit permission from BlackRock was unnecessary to list tokenized versions of their funds. It was not a deliberate decision by BlackRock to tokenize on Hedera; rather, an existing platform on the network took the liberty of tokenizing one of BlackRock’s funds. However, for the analyst, the fact that a platform on Hedera was among the first to tokenize a BlackRock fund reflects the platform’s leadership in the space. Analyst Clarifies Misconception Further examination reveals that Archax, the company behind the tokenized BlackRock fund on Hedera, is a portfolio company of ABRDN Investments, the largest asset manager in the UK, with approximately $500 billion in assets under management (AUM). Additionally, CrediBull emphasizes that BlackRock happens to be the fourth-largest shareholder of ABRDN. Notably, around ten months ago, Archax tokenized one of ABRDN’s money market funds, preceding their launch of the BlackRock fund. An interview by the Head of Digital Assets at ABRDN clarifies their involvement in the tokenization process on Archax. A “distribution agreement” was signed permitting the tokenization to proceed. If a similar agreement were reached with BlackRock, it would imply the asset manager’s endorsement of the product. Related Reading: Analysts Identify Key Scenario For Bitcoin Hitting $100,000 Ultimately, the interview with the head of digital assets at ABRDN underscores the fact that significant players are utilizing and contributing to the growth of Hedera behind the scenes. Following the clarification of the situation, the price of HBAR has retraced to $0.1199. Nevertheless, it remains up 8% over the past 24 hours and has recorded an impressive gain of nearly 60% in the past seven days. CoinGecko data highlights a substantial surge in HBAR’s trading volume, which has increased by over 1,100% in the past few days.

This has carried forward with the expectation that the price will continue to surge. One crypto analyst in particular, who goes by RLinda, has revealed why the cryptocurrency is set to surge 70%. XRP Price Completes A False Breakdown In the analysis that was posted on the TradingView website, crypto analyst RLinda outlined a number of reasons why the XRP price may be getting ready for a surge. One of these reasons is the fact that the altcoin has completed a false breakdown. Related Reading: Ethereum Resurgence: TRON Founder Justin Sun Goes On 127,388 ETH Buying Spree This is referring to the price crash that sent the price falling from $0.7 to $0.42, recording an almost 50% crash. However, the crypto analyst believes that this crash was bullish for the coin as it was basically a false breakdown, followed by a breakout. In scenarios such as this, the XRP price could be headed for a breakout similar to the breakdown and eventual recovery between August and November 2023. Such a case could see the price rise 50% with a higher end of 70%. Source: Tradingview.com Additionally, the XRP price has also been in long term consolidation, another factor that could contribute to this breakout. “XRPUSDT is forming a technical false break of support, in the long term consolidation above the zone should be formed with the purpose of continuation of growth, the potential of which can be opened by 50-70%,” the analyst stated. The State Of XRP XRP has already seen investors returning once it was clear the worst of the crash. Crypto whales, in particular, have been making their bets, moving 600 million XRP tokens. As NewsBTC reported, whales holding between 10 million and 100 million XRP increased their holdings by 30 million in just one week. But even more interesting is the fact that they have moved up to 600 million tokens in the space of two weeks. Related Reading: Ripple Vs.

One of those is crypto analyst Egrag Crypto who predicted that the XRP price is ready to spike as high as $1.4. This would mean an over 100% increase in price. However, XRP has not exactly been the market favorite in recent times. Its daily trading volume has seen a notable decline, with Coinmarketcap reporting a 20% drop to $1.33 billion in the last day. Nevertheless, the altcoin remains the 7th-largest in the space, with a market cap of $30.3 billion.

As the Bitcoin Average Dormancy chart shows, this trend recently hit a 13-year high. More Old Whales Moving Coins The Bitcoin Average Dormancy shows the average number of days each BTC has been dormant. On-chain data indicates that coins held for 3 to 5 years have changed hands and moved to new owners. While there was movement, interestingly, data shows that they were not transferred to exchanges. Instead, it is highly likely that they were traded over the counter (OTC). Related Reading: Brace For Impact: Worldcoin Team Plans To Sell 1.5 Million WLD Tokens Every Week For 6 Months Usually, any transfer to centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase could suggest the intention of selling. The more coins hit these exchanges, especially from whales, the higher the chance of price dumping. However, if trades are made via OTC, the impact on spot rates is negligible, which is a positive for bulls. Further analysis of these transfers using the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) indicator suggests that whales moving them made decent profits. Historically, whenever whales dump and register profits, prices tend to dip. Will Bitcoin Prices Retest All-Time Highs However, in a post on X, one analyst says prices will likely increase because of the impact of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These derivatives are like a buffer against price drops, considering the pace of inflows in the past weeks. Spot ETFs allow institutions to gain regulated exposure to BTC. Coupled with decreasing outflows from GBTC, the odds of prices rising remain elevated. According to Lookonchain data, GBTC unloaded 750 BTC on April 23. However, Fidelity and other eight spot ETF issuers bought 1,513 BTC on behalf of their clients. Spot Bitcoin ETF issuers sell shares representing BTC holdings. These coins can be purchased from secondary markets like Binance, via OTC platforms, or directly from miners. BTC prices remain muted and capped below $68,000, representing April 13 highs.
