35144726,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649825,1729899057,"Cardano Price Set To Skyrocket By 430%, Crypto Analyst Predicts","In an analysis published on TradingView, pseudonymous crypto analyst Melika Trader has provided a technical forecast for Cardano (ADA), highlighting a long-term upside scenario with a price target of $1.8. Using chart patterns and key price levels, Melika offers both short and long-term perspectives on ADA’s price movement. Long-Term Cardano Price Outlook Melika identifies a significant support zone for ADA between $0.30 and $0.35. This range has historically shown strong buying interest, characterized by an engulfing candle pattern and previously established supply and demand (S&D) zones. This base formation suggests a robust floor where Cardano has consistently garnered market support. The analyst points out the potential for a bullish reversal, noting that ADA’s price action appears to be forming a bottom within this support zone. “The price seems to form a bottom after engulfing the support region, hinting at a potential bullish reversal,” Melika states. Looking ahead, Melika sets a long-term resistance target between $1.20 and $1.80. This target area is not arbitrary but is based on previous price peaks, making it a significant hurdle for future price action. Should ADA maintain its support base, the path to these higher resistance levels may be realized as buyer confidence rejuvenates, setting the stage for a potential bull run. Related Reading: Cardano’s Pullback Short-Lived, Fresh Rally Underway For ADA? “The next major resistance is in the $1.20-$1.80 zone, marked as a long-term target, which aligns with previous highs. If the current support holds, ADA could be positioned for a sustained rally toward the long-term target, especially as buyers regain confidence,” Melika writes. However, she also cautions investors about a bearish scenario where ADA fails to maintain the $0.30 support level. A breach below this threshold could lead to a decline to levels below $0.18, presenting a substantial risk for holders. “A failure to hold support around $0.30 could see the price retesting to below $0.18,” Melika warns. Related Reading: Cardano Bullish Pattern Suggests A Breakout – Can ADA Reach $0.54? ADA Price Analysis: Short-Term Outlook In the immediate term, ADA is navigating a strong support zone identified between $0.33 and $0.34, aligned with a lower trendline that underscores its importance. “A bounce from this support zone could see ADA targeting the resistance zone at $0.38 – $0.39. The engulfed area suggests a possible reversal signal,” the crypto analyst claims. This resistance zone at $0.39 represents a critical point where previous sellers have previously dominated, making it a pivotal area for ADA’s short-term price action. A successful breach of this resistance could validate the bullish rebound scenario. “The $0.39 zone is a significant resistance where sellers previously controlled the market, making it a critical area to watch for any breakout,” Melika states. Conversely, if ADA fails to sustain its current support, the price could retreat towards the broader long-term support at $0.30, underpinning the downside risks highlighted by Melika. At press time, ADA traded at $0.3437.

35142970,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649919,1729895406,Bitcoin As National Reserve Asset: Key Insights From Forbes On Central Banks Interest,"A recent report published by the Bitcoin Policy Institute (BPI) and highlighted by Forbes explores the growing discussion around Bitcoin as a viable reserve asset for central banks. Authored by Dr. Matthew Ferranti, a Harvard-trained economist and former member of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, presents several compelling arguments for why central banks might consider adding Bitcoin to their portfolios. Bitcoin As A Modern Reserve Asset Dr. Ferranti begins by noting the trend of central banks increasing their gold reserves, suggesting that Bitcoin could serve as a modern counterpart. While only one central bank—the Central Bank of El Salvador—has publicly disclosed Bitcoin holdings, Dr. Ferranti highlights that Bitcoin represents just under 10% of El Salvador’s reserves. He argues that an optimal allocation would fall between 2% and 5%, allowing for diversification without excessive risk. Related Reading: Tether Defends Its Record, Blasts WSJ For ‘Irresponsible Reporting’ One of the key points raised in the report is Bitcoin’s historical performance during economic crises. Dr. Ferranti argues that a crucial feature of any reserve asset is its ability to provide returns when traditional assets falter. The report cites examples such as the financial turmoil surrounding the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023 and the US sanctions on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine in 2022, both of which corresponded with significant spikes in Bitcoin’s value. Despite Bitcoin’s short-term volatility, Dr. Ferranti posits that it has the potential to outperform traditional assets over longer periods. He attributes this to Bitcoin’s Halving cycle, which reduces the rate of new coin production and can lead to price increases. Furthermore, the economist notes that both Bitcoin and gold perform well during inflationary periods, suggesting that rising Bitcoin prices might indicate forthcoming inflation. No Default Risk And Immunity To Financial Sanctions The report also references findings from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which indicate that Bitcoin’s price is largely unaffected by macroeconomic news, except for inflation-related information. This quality, the doctor says, makes Bitcoin an effective diversifier within a portfolio, especially given its low correlation with traditional reserve assets such as gold and foreign currencies. Dr. Ferranti outlines three reasons why Bitcoin is devoid of default risk. First, the doctor contends that it does not represent a claim on future cash flows, unlike stocks and bonds. Second, the network is secured through a robust mining process. Lastly, Bitcoin is immune to financial sanctions—an important consideration for central banks—since it cannot be “frozen” in the same way traditional assets can be. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Ethereum Will Outperform Bitcoin And Solana, Is $12,000 Possible? While acknowledging that Bitcoin does not match the liquidity of the US Treasury market, Dr. Ferranti points out that its liquidity has improved significantly, with a current market cap exceeding $1.3 trillion. The economist concludes by suggesting that this level of liquidity is adequate for accommodating large transactions, making Bitcoin a more attractive option than in previous years for central banks worldwide. At the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market is trading at $67,500, down 1.5% in the 24-hour time frame.

This allows users to track transactions on the Solana network and get notifications when something happens, which was a missing feature for many observing the Solana ecosystem. 𝗦𝗢𝗟𝗔𝗡𝗔 𝗜𝗦 𝗡𝗢𝗪 𝗟𝗜𝗩𝗘 𝗢𝗡 𝗔𝗥𝗞𝗛𝗔𝗠 Arkham now supports on-chain data on the Solana blockchain. Here’s what you can expect: pic.twitter.com/M1BQVAgTIV — Arkham (@ArkhamIntel) October 25, 2024 As a result of the integration of Solana, the Arkham network can track large value transfers made between certain wallets on the Solana blockchain. This addition is especially beneficial for traders and investors who want real-time data on the transaction flow in Solana to discern important financial events and make their trades accordingly. Arkham also offers its users the ability to enable real-time trade alerts which make it easier for them to monitor large or suspicious activity happening on the Solana network. Also, the new functionality also provides for a ‘User Trade Tracker’ which enables users to track their trades directly on the blockchain and view the whole history of their investments. This feature is suitable for both individual and institutional investors who are interested in having a high level of control over their on-chain trading activities. Solana now in focus for memecoin tracking As Solana becomes the go-to blockchain for memecoins, Arkham’s new tracking features come at the right time. The platform’s tools have recently expanded to include the ability to track memecoin traders on Solana, which has been a rapidly growing space this year. As reported by Arkham, Solana is now the most popular blockchain for memecoin trading with high frequency. At the moment, Solana is ranked fifth in the blockchain market based on market capitalization, after BNB, with a market capitalization of $78.34 billion. Solana’s native token SOL was valued at $166.22 as of this writing and was down by 5.92% in the past 24 hours. This puts Solana at the top of several other networks, thus confirming its position in the crypto space. Solana’s daily trading volume hit a record $7.93 million last week. This has considerably risen since late September and shows that the network is strong and expanding. The previous record of $7.07 million was seen on October 19, and then there was a slight dip to $5.1 million the following day. The upward process reached a histological apex, which identified Solana’s strong economic activity. As reported by Cryptopolitan, the main factors that define the value of Solana’s economy are tips (Jito) and priority fees, which account for more than 90% of daily transaction volume. On October 22, tips occupied 48.3% of the total revenue and priority fees occupied 48.9%. Base fees and vote fees formed small proportions, namely 0.8% and 2% respectively. This distribution shows the increasing role of fee models in the financial system of the network.",POSITIVE,SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | SOL | ARKM,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/arkham-intelligence-solana-data-tracking/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/35142763.jpeg

35140392,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649815,1729890040,Solana Breakout From Bullish Pattern Could ‘Send SOL To The Moon’ – Crypto Analyst,"Solana (SOL) has shown remarkable strength in recent weeks, surging by 32% over the past fifteen days. This impressive price action has positioned SOL as one of the top-performing assets, outpacing Bitcoin and many other altcoins. Analysts and investors are increasingly optimistic about Solana’s potential, with many forecasting continued upward momentum in the weeks ahead. Notably, prominent investor Carl Runefelt recently shared a technical analysis on SOL, highlighting a breakout from a bullish pattern that could signal massive gains for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Number Of Bitcoin Bulls Increases As Funding Rate Shows Steady Growth – Details With this breakout, price action remains firmly bullish, indicating that the next major target for SOL is around the $185 level, where it will encounter local supply. If momentum holds, Solana could soon challenge this key resistance, further solidifying its place as a leader in the current market cycle. Solana Breaking Out Of Cup&Handle Pattern Solana is breaking out from a classic “Cup & Handle” pattern, often associated with strong bullish moves. This pattern has caught the attention of top analyst Carl Runefelt, who recently shared his technical analysis on X, indicating that Solana’s recent price action aligns with a breakout from a descending channel. According to Runefelt, this setup signals that Solana could be ready for a significant upward move. He shared a chart with a potential price target of $370, suggesting a substantial 115% surge from current levels. Runefelt’s optimism stems from the Cup & Handle pattern, where the price consolidates after an uptrend and then forms a small dip (the handle) before breaking out. This pattern is known to attract strong buyer interest, representing a period of consolidation and momentum building. However, while the breakout is promising, it may take some time to fully play out, as the entire crypto market appears to settle before its next significant move. Solana has consistently outperformed in this cycle, with price action and volume reflecting sustained investor interest. Related Reading: Dogecoin Liquidity Sweep Signals DOGE Is Ready For A Rally With Solana pushing through key resistance levels and establishing a solid foundation, the potential for a bullish continuation is high. If the breakout confirms and Solana’s momentum holds, the next weeks could see SOL pushing into new heights, solidifying its position as a top-performing altcoin and meeting investors’ bullish expectations for substantial gains ahead. SOL Testing Crucial Supply Solana is trading at $171, maintaining a strong uptrend with a well-defined bullish structure over the past two weeks. This level represents a key demand zone that previously acted as resistance, signaling a potential for higher gains if the price holds steady. A continued hold above $171 would support further bullish momentum, potentially pushing SOL toward the next significant supply area at $185. However, should SOL lose the $171 support, a retrace to around $160 is likely. This level has been pivotal in the past weeks, serving as a strong resistance point that capped previous price attempts to rise, creating a solid foundation for renewed bullish interest. A move down to $160 wouldn’t necessarily break the overall uptrend but would offer an opportunity to consolidate before the next push higher. Related Reading: Ethereum Bullish Breakout Confirmed – Top Analyst Predicts $3,400 Target As investors and traders watch these levels closely, the $171 mark will be an immediate gauge of strength. Holding above it keeps the uptrend intact, while a dip to $160 would still offer support for Solana’s longer-term bullish outlook. SOL’s resilience in these levels reflects the optimism surrounding the asset’s potential in the weeks ahead.

35139529,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649800,1729888236,"Dogecoin Price Flashes Bullish Pennant On Daily Heikin Ashi Chart, What This Means","Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade has drawn the community’s attention to a bullish pattern on the Dogecoin price chart. Based on this development, the analyst provided insights into how high the Dogecoin price could rise in the short term. Dogecoin Price Flashes Bullish Pennant Trader Tardigrade revealed in an X post that the Dogecoin price has reached the tip of a bullish pennant on the daily Heikin Ashi chart. With this occurrence, the analyst claimed a breakout was just around the corner. He added that an “easy target” measured from the pennant pole is $0.18. Related Reading: Ethereum Price At $10,000: Symmetrical Triangle Breakout Predicts Big Gains The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the Dogecoin price could reach this target before the month ends. DOGE has already enjoyed a massive uptrend this month as CryptoRank data shows that the foremost meme coin is up over 22% in October, a monthly performance that has only been topped this year by its price gains in February and March. However, a rise to $0.18 this month would match October’s price gains with those recorded in February, when DOGE enjoyed a monthly return of 50%. In March, the Dogecoin price recorded a gain of 87% as it rose to a yearly high of $0.22. The Dogecoin price uptrend this month is expected to extend until year-end and even continue in the new year, as crypto analyst Dima James said the price recovery trend will continue into 2025. Interestingly, the analyst predicted that DOGE could rally to as high as $10 and surpass it sometime next year. He made this prediction based on the 2021 bull pattern, which he claimed the meme coin is replicating again. Meanwhile, Trader Tardigrade recently mentioned that the Dogecoin price had replicated a ‘Reversal box’ move from the 2021 bull run. Because of this pattern, the analyst predicted that DOGE could reach $3.7 next year. The Run To A New All-Time High Of $3 Crypto analyst KrissPax has provided insights into how the Dogecoin price could run to this new all-time high (ATH) of $3. Using the law of diminishing returns, the analyst mentioned that he sees a resistance at $0.22, which, if DOGE breaks above, would send its price to $0.35, another resistance level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Numbers Return To January 2021 Bull Market Levels, Is A New ATH Coming? He claimed that a successful break above that resistance level would send the Dogecoin price to its current ATH of $0.73. Once that is done, KrissPax predicts that the foremost meme coin will run to a new ATH at around $3 in 2025. In the meantime, DOGE needs to clear the $0.14 resistance, with a successful breakout possibly leading to the rally to $0.20. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.138, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The inquiry, reportedly led by prosecutors from the Manhattan US Attorney’s Office, is said to focus on whether Tether’s stablecoin, USDT, has been used by third parties to finance illegal activities such as drug trafficking, terrorism, and hacking, or to launder the proceeds from these activities. Tether CEO Denies Investigation Claims In response to these serious allegations, Tether has issued a statement strongly criticizing the WSJ’s reporting. The company called the article “wildly irresponsible,” asserting that it is inappropriate for the WSJ to publish such definitive claims without verified sources or corroboration from authorities. The stablecoin issuer also emphasized that it has no knowledge of any ongoing investigations, characterizing the report as based on “pure rank speculation.” Related Reading: Shiba Inu Inflows Soar 555% In 3 Months – Will The Momentum Continue? Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, also took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to further address the issue, stating, “As we told to WSJ, there is no indication that Tether is under investigation. WSJ is regurgitating old noise. Full stop.” This response underlines the company’s commitment to transparency in the face of these allegations and the increased scrutiny it has faced in recent years, not only from the US authorities but also from news outlets such as the WSJ, and its stance against what it considers to be unfounded allegations. Commitment To Combating Cryptocurrency Misuse The article from the WSJ also reportedly downplays Tether’s extensive collaborations with law enforcement agencies aimed at combating illicit activities involving cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Hit $125,000 By Year-End If Trump Wins, Says Standard Chartered Tether highlighted its proactive measures to work with the authorities to ensure that its platform is not misused by bad actors.

42373503,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllmi2P,1729883505,Polymarket Is a Success for Polygon Blockchain – Everywhere But the Bottom Line,"Polymarket – the decentralized predictions market – has been a massive success for the Polygon blockchain, in terms of being an app that is organically breaking out, getting mainstream usage and attention.  But according to data, Polymarket has only brought in $27,000 in fees on Polygon’s PoS blockchain in 2024.  Polygon Labs CEO Marc Boiron agreed that $27,000 is a low figure, but argues that this shows how cheap it is to use the blockchain – a selling point. The fees for transacting on Polygon is about $0.007, easily below the sub-cent threshold that several teams have targeted.  Boiron arguest that apps like Polymarket aren’t expected to bring in large revenues in transaction fees, as one might expect from more transaction-intensive applications like decentralized crypto exchanges.  One of the major breakout successes this year for the team behind layer-2 blockchain Polygon is Polymarket – the decentralized predictions market where users have flocked this year to place bets on everything from presidential politics to the conclusion of an HBO documentary.  What's less clear to crypto analysts examining Polygon's performance metrics is whether the coup will bring relief to holders of the project's ailing tokens, down 65% this year.  Polymarket has soared in popularity among mainstream users, allowing them to make bets on the upcoming U.S. presidential election. Polymarket bettors have added nearly $2.4 billion on the question of whether Donald Trump or Kamala Harris will win the election in November. Bettors also recently made a market on whom a recently debuted HBO documentary about Bitcoin would attempt to identify as inventor Satoshi Nakamoto.  Polymarket is built on the Polygon PoS blockchain, and the application is one of the first major organic successes for the team – known for a past marketing strategy of paying partners like Starbucks to use the network.  So given the application's boom in usage, why has it only produced a small amount in dollar figures for the Polygon team, and barely any bump in the price of the native POL token?  According to data from Token Terminal, as of Oct. 23, Polymarket has only brought in about $27,000 of transaction fees for Polygon PoS in 2024.  The answer, in part, is that the fees are market-based. And lately, transacting on Polygon PoS is extremely cheap.  The average transaction fee on the Polygon PoS chain on that same day was $0.007.  Anytime a Polymarket user makes a bet, they’re creating a transaction on Polygon PoS. As part of those transactions, they pay fees to Polygon PoS, which is split up into a base fee and a priority fee. The base fee does not go towards validators; instead it is burned – sent to a null address that theoretically should benefit tokenholders by helping to reduce the supply.  “That base fee is adjustable and it's based off of network congestion,” Polygon Labs CEO Marc Boiron told CoinDesk in an interview. “So as the network gets more congested, that base fee increases.”  The priority fee is paid out to a validator.  “You're paying the validator to say, Please include me in a block,"" Boiron added. ""The higher a fee you pay, the earlier the validator will include you in a block if there's more congestion.”  If there's ample blockspace, there's less of a need to pay up.  Another issue is that, in the grand scheme of things, while Polymarket's bettors are quite active, the volume of transactions doesn't come close to the level of high-intensity applications like decentralized crypto exchanges (DEXs).  So far this month, 5.2% of transactions on the Polygon PoS chain came from Polymarket, according to Polygon’s research team. Chainlink makes up 10.38% of transactions on PoS, while transfers of the stablecoin USDT make up 4.89%.  Just to take the example of a recent day's activity. On Oct. 23, Polymarket accounted for about 8% of the ""gas"" used on Polygon PoS, based on data from the blockchain explorer PolygonScan. That made it the largest individual contributor. In blockchain terminology, gas is a measure of the computational intensity required for any given batch of transactions.  “I look at how it's built,"" Boiron said. ""I would never expect a lot of fees from Polymarket, because it doesn't have a massive amount of composability, like Uniswap. It has some, but not a lot. It's really just users coming there. They’re executing a transaction, and then stopping. So it's inherently never going to drive that much until, like, the number of users goes way up.”  Attention is the reward  Polygon for long has looked for its mainstream breakthrough moment, pouring millions into the partnerships with Starbucks and Meta to try and bring Web3 to the masses. Those deals never really took off.  The Polygon team is encouraged by the enormous attention that Polymarket has been getting, hoping the attention will feed into bigger numbers in the wider Polygon ecosystem.  Boiron told CoinDesk: “The question is, like, why is Polymarket so interesting if they are only bringing $20K? The obvious reason is just, let's call it attention.”  The success shows that “you can have an amazingly successful app on Polygon PoS that, like you can, you hardly even know that you're using a blockchain,” he said.  To look on the bright side, “Paying only $20K in transaction fees, frankly, just reflects how cheap it is to use Polygon PoS,” Boiron said.  The organic explosion of Polymarket has contributed to Polygon’s success because of the attention it brings to the ecosystem, he said.  “Different applications have different roles,"" Boiron said. ""For me, Polymarket’s role includes: We're giving them super cheap transactions that make it really easy. And attention is the thing – that is the value add – that Polymarket brings for us.”  “Now, that's very different from, let's say there's somebody who comes and builds an order book DEX on Polygon PoS,"" he said. ""If they were doing $20,000 of fees over multiple months, it would be a massive failure, because you would expect massive numbers of orders placed and canceled and filled, then that would drive huge numbers of transactions. So the key here is like, different applications have different intended purposes.”  Read more: Polymarket Reportedly Seeks $50M in Funding, Mulls Token as Election Bets Surge  UPDATE (18:17 UTC): Adds bullets at the top of the story.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | LINK | MARKET | MATIC,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/10/25/polymarket-is-huge-success-for-polygon-blockchain-everywhere-but-the-bottom-line,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d187999dfff38af306653967ba7707a43d22a4c3-2106x1246.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The world's oldest cryptocurrency on Monday hovered around the $70K threshold, but was not able to break into it. Since then, BTC has largely stayed below $69K and went down to $66.6K. ""BTC was again rejected at the $70,000 level this week but continued its positive uptrend from the September lows. Analysts expect higher prices but more price volatility for Bitcoin leading up to the U.S. elections next month,"" Nick Ruck, Independent Market Analyst, said. Meanwhile, altcoins have seen more sporadic behavior as DeFi tokens have continued a generally bearish trend while memecoins have taken much of the attention and liquidity from traders, Ruck added. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), like the broader U.S. equities markets, is widely expected to see increased volatility in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election. ""Bitcoin appears to be waking from its long slumber and breaking higher against its downward channel and looking to challenge the ATHs as we head into the elections,"" said Augustine Fan, Head of Insights, SOFA.org. With the focus on the U.S. election results being front and center, the most positive outcome for crypto would be a Trump win along with a Republican sweep (of House & Senate), allowing the Trump/Vance endorsed digital asset reform plans to have a realistic chance of passing through congress, Fan added. Some analysts have turned bullish for Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) prospects, and expected the cryptocurrency to break out of the current trading range. Over the week, BTC traded between $66.6K - $69.5K. The next big bull run in Bitcoin is underway, with targets between $180k-$300k once new all-time highs are achieved, said Seeking Alpha analyst BullBear Trading . Technical indicators show Bitcoin has plenty of upside potential, with weekly and daily RSI levels indicating room for further growth, said BullBear Trading and added, ""Short-term resistance may occur around $72k-$74k, but beyond that, Bitcoin has a clear path for a strong bullish advance.""

35136990,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649799,1729882838,On-Chain Indicator Signals Bitcoin Cycle Top Is Far Ahead – Data Confirms Bullish Outlook,"Bitcoin currently ranges between $65,000 and $69,500 following two weeks of bullish price action, sparking renewed optimism among analysts and investors. The prevailing sentiment is that BTC is on the verge of reaching new all-time highs in the coming weeks, with confidence building that March’s cycle top predictions may have been premature. Related Reading: Dogecoin Liquidity Sweep Signals DOGE Is Ready For A Rally Key metrics from CryptoQuant reveal that Bitcoin is still far from typical cycle-top conditions, instead signaling a bullish outlook as we move into November. As the U.S. election approaches November 5 and macroeconomic factors continue to shift, price action is expected to remain unpredictable and volatile. Market participants are watching closely, expecting that geopolitical and economic events could influence BTC’s trajectory. Given this context, many believe the next major move for Bitcoin could catalyze a fresh leg up, potentially breaking through previous highs. Bitcoin Calm Before The Storm? Bitcoin is holding firm above $67,000, showing resilience as it edges to a potential breakout above $70,000. However, the current price action indicates that Bitcoin may consolidate below this key level before moving up to new highs in the next leg. Market participants closely watch BTC’s behavior around these price levels, as a sustained push above $70,000 could set the stage for significant gains. CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler recently shared critical insights on X, highlighting the current Long-Term Holder (LTH) to Short-Term Holder (STH) SOPR Ratio, which sits at 1.8. This metric is often used to gauge selling pressure and market sentiment, with higher levels indicating increased profit-taking that could signal a market peak. According to Adler, when this ratio climbs to around 7, Bitcoin will be nearing a cycle culmination. The ratio’s bullish cross with its 90-day moving average reflects a positive outlook, supporting the narrative that BTC remains well below its cycle top. Related Reading: Number Of Bitcoin Bulls Increases As Funding Rate Shows Steady Growth – Details This metric’s movement and broader market strength paint a favorable picture for Bitcoin’s price action in the coming weeks. The data suggests that Bitcoin still has room to grow within this cycle, providing confidence to long-term holders and investors looking for continued upside. BTC Technical Levels Bitcoin is trading at $67,500, facing challenges after failing to maintain its bullish structure on the 4-hour chart. The price couldn’t set a new high above $69,500, marking a potential shift in momentum. A crucial support level now sits at $65,000, the local low that previously held the bullish trend intact. Holding above this level is essential to prevent a broader retrace and maintain confidence among bulls. Currently, price action remains indecisive, leaving the direction for the coming days unclear. A breakout above $69,500 would restore the bullish structure, likely drawing more buyers into the market and signaling another rally attempt. Conversely, a break below the $65,000 support would signal a retrace, potentially leading BTC to lower demand zones as bulls look to regroup.

With both bulls and bears vying for control, BTC’s ability to hold above $65,000 will be crucial to retaining bullish sentiment.

The latest data shows inflow from large holders has increased by 555% within the last 90 days, which means major stakeholders are taking positions to capitalize on an expected increase in value. This is especially significant due to the total bearish sentiment that many are experiencing across the crypto market. Related Reading: XRP Could Rally 27% This Week In ‘Tremendous Move’, Analyst Says Shiba Inu: Growing Market Trend While the market sentiment seems still negative, the current trend of Shiba Inu shows a developing resilience. According to Santiment, while the broader crypto market was marked by fear and uncertainty, the negative sentiment in SHIB has gone down dramatically by 718% within just one day. This sharp decline in percentage indicates growing investor pessimism, especially considering the fact that the price of SHIB had dropped from its weekly high at $0.00001929 below $0.000017. But this silver lining, as it is, shows that the 7-day sentiment for SHIB has spiked upward by over 2,800% and might be an antidote for the asset to get a bounce-back. 🐻 Crypto markets have corrected alongside equities as traders increase speculation that the bull rally has come to an end.

If the sentiment went bearish, then, generally speaking, price moved in the opposite direction. In the case of weighted sentiment being positive at 339% for 30 days for SHIB, hope is still not completely lost and maybe, it will be rallying within the coming days. Whale Activities Up The significant increase in large-holder inflows is particularly telling. Over the last three months, these inflows surged by 554.88%, indicating that major investors see value in accumulating SHIB at current prices. In fact, there was also a 163% increase in inflows over the past month, and even a modest uptick of 1.29% in the last week. Related Reading: 5 Million Strong: Active Ethereum Wallets Drive Strong Momentum Larger Holders End August With Neutral Positions Despite these positive indicators from large holders, trading volume has seen a slight decline of 5.23% in one day. This drop indicates that many investors are still hesitant to make significant moves in this volatile environment. They may be waiting for clearer signals before committing to trades. Further out, SHIB appears to be on an uptrend at a much slower pace, with a projected 90% rise for the next six months, possibly due to growing interest in the long-term potential, data from CoinCheckup shows. Even more encouraging, analysts also project a strong rise of 76% over the next year, clearly outlining positive growth expectations commensurate with the incrementing adoption of SHIB and its use cases.

CME Group Crypto futures and options saw increased trading activity amid market volatility in early August. The 2024 U.S. Presidential Election could also be a pivotal moment for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general, especially regarding the regulatory environment. By Jim Iuorio At a Glance Historically, bitcoin has reached new all-time highs between six and twelve months after each halving event CME Group Crypto futures and options saw increased trading activity amid market volatility in early August On April 19th, 2024, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) experienced its fourth ""halving"" since its inception in 2009. This event, hardcoded into Bitcoin's protocol, occurs approximately every four years – or more precisely, every 210,000 blocks mined. Its primary function is to reduce the reward that miners receive for validating transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain. The reward is cut in half, with several intended downstream effects on the coin: Supply Control: The halving mechanism is designed to reduce the rate at which new coins are created and entered into circulation. Create Scarcity: By reducing the rate of new bitcoin creation, the halving increases its scarcity over time. Price Support: By reducing the supply of bitcoin while demand remains constant, the halving theoretically supports price appreciation. The concept of a fixed total supply (capped at 21 million coins) and increasing scarcity has long been considered one of bitcoin's primary advantages over traditional fiat currencies and even other cryptocurrencies. This feature is often cited as a key factor in maintaining bitcoin's value proposition within the space. Bitcoin’s Ups and Downs Historically, new all-time highs have been achieved between six and 12 months after each halving event. However, it's important to note that the sample size is quite small, at only three. To fully appreciate the potential impact of the 2024 halving, it's essential to consider the broader market context of the past few years. Near the end of 2022, bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market experienced a severe downturn, with bitcoin's price plummeting by approximately 77% from its previous all-time high. The collapse of major crypto firms, including the high-profile FTX exchange, contributed to negative sentiment and ushered in a period of intense regulatory scrutiny. At the beginning of 2023, the narrative flipped, and the market began to focus on a series of positive headlines: Major financial institutions like BlackRock ( BLK ), Vanguard and VanEck made significant moves to increase their exposure to bitcoin. The approval and launch of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States marked a pivotal moment for mainstream access and acceptance. Bitcoin went on a historic tear, rallying over 300% in the subsequent 15 months, topping at an all-time high of $73,000 in mid-March, one month before the halving. With various unknowns still ahead, CME Group Bitcoin futures contracts have played a significant role in adding flexibility to investing in, trading, or hedging the risk of holding the coin. As market volatility surged in early August, so did interest in CME Crypto futures and options. The week of August 5 was the best trading week to date with over 960K contracts traded, and this contributed to a record average daily volume (ADV) for the third quarter. Higher Prices Ahead? The important question is: Did the market already discount the halving's effect on supply, or are we yet to see the past pattern of a delayed price spike? It’s hard to know for sure. Bitcoin’s ability to rally to new highs may come down to the alternative forces influencing the coin. Domestic interest rates should be a major factor – bitcoin prices rose over 2% within the first 24 hours following the Federal Reserve’s announcement of a 50 basis point cut in its September meeting. Lower rates could continue to be a tailwind for bitcoin for two reasons: Lower rates lead to currency weakness. This should boost fiat proxy and hedging instruments like gold and bitcoin. Lower rates make holding non-yielding assets more attractive. This concept makes more sense if you view the inverse first: Higher rates, or opportunity cost, makes holding non-yielding assets less attractive. The 2024 U.S. Presidential Election could also be a pivotal moment for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general, especially regarding the regulatory environment. As of mid-September, Republican nominee Donald Trump has voiced support for crypto, while Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris, has not shared an official stance on the subject. These factors, in addition to this year’s halving, could all influence bitcoin’s price for the remainder of the year.

The tokenized funds will be set up and issued under Kazakhstan's financial services law, under regulatory oversight of Astana Financial Services Authority (AFSA), where SkyBridge and Bitfinex are licensed to operate. Bitfinex Securities is responsible for the tokenization process, while SkyBridge will act as broker and manager of the tokenized fund. The products will be available to retail users, but with certain geographic limitations, and available to be purchased with Tether's stablecoin {{USDT}}.  Representatives of the companies involved signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) toward creating the tokenized funds on Friday in Lugano, Switzerland at a side event during the Plan B conference.  The vehicle will offer exposure in a ""fund of funds"" structure to various existing Lazard-managed funds focused on global equities and emerging market equities, which have been available only to professional investors and institutions before, Matthias Kruse, managing director at Lazard, told CoinDesk.  ""We are a B2B [business-to-business] investment firm, and this is a good way for us to service retail investors,"" Kruse said. Kruse also touted tokenization as a process that improves efficiency, liquidity and helps lower operational costs.  Tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) is a rapidly growing sector in the intersection of digital assets and traditional finance that involves placing assets such as bonds, credit and funds on blockchain rails. Participants do so in pursuit of faster settlements and increased efficiency compared to traditional financial plumbing.  The tokenization trend came to the forefront this year with global banks and asset managers, including BlackRock, HSBC starting offering tokenized products. The RWA market is poised to become a multi-trillion dollar market over the coming years, according to McKinsey, BCG, 21Shares and Bernstein.  Lazard's asset management business has $245 billion of assets under management (AUM). SkyBridge Invest is a Kazakhstan-based investment services firm, different from SkyBridge Capital of veteran Wall Street hedge funder Anthony Scaramucci.

35131941,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649801,1729872036,"Crypto Analyst Says Ethereum Will Outperform Bitcoin And Solana, Is $12,000 Possible?","A top crypto analyst has issued a bold prediction for Ethereum, forecasting it will outperform both Bitcoin and Solana in the coming months. Taking to social media platform X, a crypto analyst known pseudonymously as @IamCryptoWolf highlighted that Ethereum is still bullish, with price targets reaching up to $12,000. This analysis comes in light of a 6.22% decline in the price of Ethereum in the past seven days and a continued increase in the Bitcoin dominance. Analyst Says Ethereum Will Outperform Bitcoin Ethereum has mostly lagged behind Bitcoin in price performance since the current market cycle began, struggling to gain momentum above the $3,000 mark since July. Ethereum bulls have faced challenges in attracting significant inflows, which has kept the price below key levels while Bitcoin has surged. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Numbers Return To January 2021 Bull Market Levels, Is A New ATH Coming? Bitcoin recently climbed back above $67,000 and is now approaching its yearly high of $73,737. Solana has also found its way above $170 again and could continue on the momentum to break above its yearly high of $202. However, despite Ethereum’s underperformance relative to these two crypto heavyweights, crypto analyst @IamCryptoWolf believes the trend is going to reverse in the second half of the cycle. The analyst provided his Ethereum outlook in reference to its price movements on the 3-day candlestick chart. The chart shows Ethereum rebounding off the bottom trendline of an ascending triangle, indicating the potential for an upward move. Consequently, the analyst projected a full breakout of multiple price resistances when the momentum finally rolls into Ethereum. Should this breakout occur, @IamCryptoWolf predicts Ethereum will surpass Bitcoin and Solana in performance during the second half of this bull cycle. He further noted a price target range for Ethereum’s surge, placing the lower boundary at $8,428, with a high-end target reaching up to $12,000. This projected breakout has sparked renewed interest in Ethereum’s ability to regain a leading position, especially among investors who are still waiting for an altcoin rally phase led by Ethereum. What’s Next For ETH? At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,472, having lost about 3% of its value in the past 24 hours. This sort of performance has left many ETH investors feeling uncertain about the asset’s near-term outlook. According to data from IntoTheBlock, about 51.40% of addresses that bought in between $2,106.27 and $2,855.96 are in losses, not to talk of those that bought above $2,855.96. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Retests Bullish Channel At $65,000, Analyst Reveals What’s Next Interestingly, @IamCryptoWolf addressed this trend among ETH investors in another post on social media platform X. Here, he highlighted that Ethereum is still bullish despite the underperformance. The analyst explained that Ethereum’s current price movement appears to be forming either an inverted head and shoulders or an ascending triangle pattern on the charts, both of which are traditionally seen as bullish formations in technical analysis.

42424699,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHVyfh,1729869602,Aggregation Is the Only Way to Unify Web3,"In the early days of the Internet, networks were isolated and couldn’t communicate with each other. Then TCP/IP came along, connecting everything and changing the game.  Today, Web3 faces a similar problem to the early internet—blockchains and platforms are stuck in silos, fragmenting liquidity and making for a clunky user experience. Value can’t flow freely between networks, limiting what users and markets can actually do.  But aggregation would change all that by tearing down the walls and unlocking the full potential of Web3.  Marc Boiron is the chief executive officer at Polygon Labs, developer of the eponymous blockchain and, more recently, AggLayer.  The Missing Piece: Cross-Chain Settlement  Web3 needs an aggregation layer that can break down the silos between networks. This wouldn’t just fix the issues we see today—it would kick off a new chapter in the internet's evolution, unlocking new design spaces and possibilities for a truly unified crypto ecosystem.  With such a layer, every platform could access more liquidity and users across all connected chains. Any exchange could offer any asset, no matter which network it’s on. No more network integrations necessary to list new tokens. That’s the kind of future we should be building toward.  Aggregation is the key for Web3 to work like the Internet does today—everything is available from one place, with information, assets, and value moving around as easily as sending an email. Users could have a single universal profile and wallet that serves as their gateway to all of Web3, keeping a secure, unchangeable record of their history and credentials.  Additionally, a cross-chain settlement layer would unify the developer experience, letting builders create smoother, more powerful apps that are not constrained by bottlenecks of a single chain or fragmentation of the user experience and assets. By simplifying complex cross-chain processes into easy commands, projects could tap into the entire ecosystem, accessing any asset or tool from any chain.  Overhauling DeFi  While these ideas sound great in theory, it's the real-world applications that will unlock their full potential. Take decentralized finance, for example. Right now, liquidity in and users of DeFi dApps are stuck in ""walled gardens"" across different blockchains. Developers are forced to choose specific chains for deployment based on technical perks or grants, and users are left navigating these silos with limited options. The only current solutions—bridges and wrapped tokens—are often inefficient, expensive, and risky.  A cross-chain settlement layer would change all that, enhancing innovations such as unified yield farming, where users could seamlessly earn returns on their assets across multiple chains without having to rely on any third-party bridges or wrapped tokens. Combine that with cheap, easy token swaps and new opportunities in cross-chain arbitrage, and DeFi would become even more powerful than it is now.  An aggregated approach would also benefit tokenized real-world assets. Right now, the biggest hurdle to RWA adoption is the lack of cross-chain settlement between blockchains. Tokenizing an RWA on Ethereum, for example, limits its interaction with networks that are incompatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, fragmenting the asset’s value. This creates isolated pockets rather than a real market, which is why the European Central Bank has called for a shared digital ledger for tokenized assets.  Solving this problem would enable true cross-chain markets, where fractional ownership and funds could be backed by a wider variety of assets than ever before. Everything from land and art to stocks and investment funds could exist in a global digital economy, untethered from a physical location.  True Web3 Gaming and DePIN  Aggregated networks hold massive potential for Web3 gaming. For years, the promise of digital ownership and open markets in gaming has been on the horizon, but fragmentation has kept it from being fully realized. While ecosystems such as Immutable and Ronin exist, they can't easily move players or content between them.  Now, imagine all gaming platforms connecting to a single cross-chain settlement layer. Suddenly, every game would be part of the same ecosystem, like having a Steam account that gives you full access to games across PC, Nintendo, Xbox, and PlayStation. Developers would gain access to the entire global gamer base as potential users, breaking down the barriers between fragmented ecosystems.  This same concept applies to the emerging field of decentralized physical infrastructure networks. DePINs provide decentralized internet services through a network of incentivized physical devices, offering better performance than traditional centralized providers while removing concerns about Big Tech's data harvesting or infrastructure downtime.  Right now, DePINs operate in silos, making data sharing and system integration unnecessarily complicated and costly. An aggregation network solves these silos, allowing easy collaboration between different DePIN systems, cutting costs, and removing hurdles to cross-chain settlement.  * * *  These examples are scratching the surface, hinting at a wide range of possibilities in areas such as user data ownership and monetization. What’s even more exciting is that this kind of cross-chain settlement will let developers build entirely new projects and services we haven’t imagined.  The topic of interoperability and aggregation has been rapidly gaining momentum lately, with many well-known blockchain tech leaders working on solutions to unify Web3. Next month, the first-ever event focused on blockchain aggregation, the Aggregation Summit, will kick off in Bangkok ahead of the Ethereum Foundation's Devcon 2024 conference.  A fully connected, fast, affordable, and secure Web3 is within reach—and it's an internet with native value open to everyone. The key is aggregation.

42373490,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllmgw3,1729868608,Tokenized Treasuries Like Blackrock's BUIDL Will Challenge Stablecoins But Won't Fully Replace Them: JPMorgan,"Tokenized treasuries won't fully replace stablecoins, JPMorgan said.  Stablecoins have a regulatory advantage because they are not classified as securities, the report noted.  Liquidity in stablecoins is also much higher than tokenized treasuries, the bank said.  Stablecoins are unlikely to be fully replaced by tokenized treasuries, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report Thursday.  It is ""conceivable"" that over time, tokenized treasuries could replace most of the cash sitting unused within stablecoins, the report said.  Still, the bank said a full replacement of stablecoins seems unlikely. This is because tokenized treasuries are at a regulatory disadvantage due to their classification as securities. This means they are subject to more restrictions than stablecoins, limiting their use as collateral in the wider crypto ecosystem  The report also said the amount of ""idle cash"" within stablecoins is hard to calculate, but it is unlikely to ""represent the majority of the stablecoin universe."" For this reason, tokenized treasuries, such as Blackrock's BUIDL, will likely only replace a small part of the stablecoin market, JPMorgan noted.  A stablecoin is a type of crypto designed to hold a steady value and is usually pegged to the U.S. dollar, though other currencies and commodities such as gold are also used.  The bank noted that stablecoins currently have a large advantage over tokenized treasuries when it comes to liquidity. With a total market of almost $180 billion across many blockchains and centralized exchanges (CEX), stablecoins offer low transaction fees even on larger trades.  ""This deep liquidity supports seamless trading,"" analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.  Tokenized treasuries, in contrast, have much lower liquidity, the bank noted, adding that this disadvantage may lessen over time as the products gain more traction.

The Netherlands launched a consultation on Thursday on a bill that would require crypto services to share their users' data with tax authorities.

35129610,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649783,1729866606,"Bitcoin To Hit $125,000 By Year-End If Trump Wins, Says Standard Chartered","In a research paper dated October 24, Geoff Kendrick, Global Head of Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered Bank, predicts that Bitcoin could surge to $125,000 by the end of the year if former President Donald Trump secures victory in the upcoming US presidential election. When Bitcoin Could Hit $125,000 Kendrick’s analysis hinges on the interplay between Bitcoin’s price movements and the US political landscape. “We use daily BTC vol levels and popular strike levels to estimate post-election price moves,” he states in the report titled Bitcoin – Post-US Election Playbook. According to Kendrick, Bitcoin prices have been ascending in recent weeks, aligning with other trades favored by Trump supporters. The report forecasts that Bitcoin is likely to reach approximately $73,000 by Election Day on November 5, nearing its all-time high of $73,800 recorded in March. “Our base case is that Bitcoin rises to around $73,000 by Election Day, catching up to betting-market probabilities of a Trump win,” Kendrick notes. Related Reading: Is Too Late To Accumulate Bitcoin? What This Indicator Says Betting markets are reflecting increasing confidence in a Trump victory. “The average betting odds of a Trump victory now stand at 59%, according to RealClearPolitics. Furthermore, conditional probabilities in specific betting markets (Polymarket) suggest a 75% chance of a Republican sweep if Trump wins the presidency,” the report highlights. Should Trump win, Kendrick anticipates immediate bullish momentum for Bitcoin. “Assuming a Trump victory, options break-even implies a further price rise of about 4% when the presidential outcome is known, and around 10% in total within a few more days,” he explains. Related Reading: $200,000 Bitcoin In 2025? $791 Billion Asset Manager Calls It ‘Conservative’ The potential for a Republican sweep of Congress amplifies this outlook. “If the Republicans sweep Congress, our year-end target level of USD 125,000 should come into view,” Kendrick asserts. This scenario is underpinned by significant open interest in Bitcoin call options expiring on December 27 at the $80,000 strike price, suggesting rapid movement toward that level. What If Harris Wins? In contrast, if Vice President Kamala Harris emerges victorious, the report suggests a temporary setback for Bitcoin prices. “If Harris wins, we see BTC initially trading lower but still ending 2024 at fresh highs around $75,000,” Kendrick projects. This implies a resilient long-term outlook for Bitcoin regardless of the election outcome, though the magnitude of gains would differ. Kendrick emphasizes the role of options market data in gauging potential price movements. “Options info helps estimate initial post-election price moves,” he states. The heavy trading volumes and popular strike levels serve as indicators of investor expectations and market positioning ahead of the election. The recent dip in Bitcoin’s price to a local low of $65,200 was addressed as well. Kendrick believes this is “likely to be the last before the U.S. presidential election,” suggesting that any short-term corrections may be overshadowed by the impending political developments. At press time, BTC traded at $67,520.

35127254,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649774,1729861248,Bitcoin Soars Towards $68K Amid Microsoft’s BTC Investment SEC Filing,"Microsoft is preparing for a critical shareholder meeting on December 10, during which the future of Bitcoin as a potential investment will be a heated topic. At present, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $68,115, which represents an increase of approximately 1.22%. The rise in interest aligns with constant debates around the cryptocurrency as an inflation hedge, which some Microsoft investors find appealing. Related Reading: XRP Could Rally 27% This Week In ‘Tremendous Move’, Analyst Says Microsoft’s Position On Bitcoin Microsoft revealed in a recent application to the US Securities and Exchange Commission that it will propose evaluating Bitcoin investment during the forthcoming conference. The National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR) says that Bitcoin has done better than traditional investments and could be a good way to protect against inflation. JUST IN: Per an SEC filing, Microsoft will have a proposed board resolution for an “Assessment of Investing in Bitcoin”. The board is recommending that shareholders vote AGAINST the proposal. pic.twitter.com/0WveygitH9 — TFTC (@TFTC21) October 24, 2024 Microsoft’s board, on the other hand, wants shareholders to vote against this plan because the company has already looked at a wide range of investable assets, including cryptocurrencies. According to a spokesperson for the company: “Volatility is one of the important aspects for all the investments in cryptocurrencies for corporate treasury” This emphasizes the careful strategy that Microsoft has adopted as far as the management of its corporate treasury is concerned as well as for the benefit of enhancing the shareholders value for the long term. The board is of the opinion that the requested public appraisal is unnecessary, as they already monitor trends and developments in the cryptocurrency sector. Big-Wig Stockholders Microsoft’s major shareholders include a number of major institutional investors, such as Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street. These organizations own a large percentage of the company and have considerable power to affect its policy direction. Although some shareholders are advocating for Bitcoin investments, others may be more in line with the board’s cautious stance. It is important to note that BlackRock has been actively increasing its Bitcoin holdings through its ETFs. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF has registered inflows to the tune of over $317 million in a 24-hour timeframe, according to recent reports. This trend implies that there is an increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin, despite Microsoft’s reluctance to implement comparable measures. The Road Ahead As the December conference gets ready, the debate about Bitcoin’s importance in Microsoft’s investment plan gets more intense. The NCPPR argues that businesses should commit at least 1% of their whole assets to Bitcoin to help to reduce inflation risks. Despite this project, Microsoft insists that its present corporate treasury distribution policies are sufficient. Related Reading: 5 Million Strong: Active Ethereum Wallets Drive Strong Momentum Bitcoin has experienced a nearly twofold increase in value in the past year and has recorded a remarkable 414% increase over the past five years. Although Microsoft may not be completely prepared to invest in cryptocurrency investments at this time, the increasing interest from institutional investors such as BlackRock suggests that the discourse surrounding Bitcoin is far from over. Microsoft’s upcoming shareholder meeting will be the focus of all attention, and it is uncertain whether the tech giant will alter its position on cryptocurrencies or maintain its commitment to stability in its investment strategy.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 2,081.93 +0.82% Bitcoin (BTC): $67,929.41 +1.33% Ether (ETH): $2,539.37 +0.56% S&P 500: 5,809.86 +0.21% Gold: $2,723.02 -0.42% Nikkei 225: 37,913.92 -0.6%  Top Stories  Bitcoin traded between $67,500-$67,900 during the European morning following a retreat from above $68,000. BTC remains over 1.2% higher in the last 24 hours, outperforming other major tokens, which have posted more modest gains. ETH and SOL have risen around 0.75%, while DOGE is up nearly 1%. The broader digital asset market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index, has risen just under 0.8%. Bitcoin looks on course to close the week over 1% lower, according to CoinDesk Indices data, having failed to sustain any of its ascents north of $68,000.  The board of Microsoft has recommended shareholders vote against a proposal for the company to assess bitcoin as an inflationary hedge. In a filing with the SEC on Thursday, Microsoft laid out issues to discuss at the company’s next shareholder meeting. One of the proposals suggests that the tech firm should look into bitcoin to hedge against inflation and other macroeconomic influences. “As the proposal itself notes, volatility is a factor to consider in evaluating cryptocurrency investments for corporate treasury applications that require stable and predictable investments to ensure liquidity and operational funding. Microsoft has strong and appropriate processes in place to manage and diversify its corporate treasury for the long-term benefit of shareholders and this requested public assessment is unwarranted,” it said.  Balance, Canada’s long-standing crypto custodian, finally attained qualified custodian status this week, prompting the firm’s CEO, George Bordianu, to say it’s time to start bringing the country’s ETF digital assets “back home.” Bordianu is alluding to the fact that the safekeeping of crypto assets underlying funds issued by ETF providers 3iQ, Purpose Investments and Evolve, end up in sub-custody arrangements and held by blue chip U.S. exchanges like Coinbase and Gemini, rather than remaining on Canadian soil. “We have billions worth of retail assets in Canada’s crypto ETFs that sit in the United States,” Bordianu said in an interview. “We're trying to simplify the picture, to make it cheaper and a little bit easier for new asset managers to do a few more ETF and mutual funds in Canada.”  Chart of the Day  The chart shows bitcoin's options-based implied volatility and forward implied volatility, which is the projected volatility of the cryptocurrency over the coming months.  The higher forward IV for the Nov. 8 expiry indicates expectations for price turbulence likely stemming from the U.S. election result.  The 72% annualized forward IV figure means traders expect a price swing of around 3.8% on that day.

Here’s how this analyst’s “Risk Indicator” is looking for DOGE after this run. Dogecoin Risk Indicator Has Given A Red Signal Recently In a new post on X, CryptoQuant community manager Maartunn has shared a “Risk Indicator” for Dogecoin. As for what the metric does, the analyst has explained, I calculated the percentage change over the last 168 hours (one week). When the percentage change exceeds a specific threshold, it indicates a potential risk zone. Related Reading: Is Too Late To Accumulate Bitcoin? What This Indicator Says The risk here is toward Bitcoin and since the rest of the sector usually follows in its lead, it would also be toward cryptocurrencies as a whole. Below is the chart for the indicator posted by Maartunn. As is visible in the above graph, the Dogecoin Risk Indicator has been giving a signal during the past week or so as the DOGE price has registered a notable jump of 16% From the graph, it’s also apparent that each time the indicator has lit up in the past few months, the price of Bitcoin has probably hit some top. Indeed, since the latest signal has appeared, the BTC rally has been derailed, which implies fast growth in the memecoin’s price may once again have proven to be a bad omen for the sector. Now, why does this pattern exist? The reason is that whenever memecoins break away from Bitcoin and the company, it’s usually a sign that greed is taking over the market. Historically, cryptocurrencies have tended to move in the direction that the crowd expects, so excessive greed often leads to a bearish outcome. Investors have recently been speculating on memecoins like Dogecoin, seeking fast returns. Still, if this previous pattern is to go by, DOGE and others may have to slow down if the market has to continue its uplift. In some other news, the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has shared an update on how the average holding time compares between the major cryptocurrency networks in an X post. As displayed in the above table, Bitcoin is leading in this metric, with cryptocurrency investors holding for an average period of 4.4 years before transferring their coins. Related Reading: Analytics Firm Reveals Why Dogecoin & Apecoin Hit Tops Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu are all tied for second, with the figure at 2.4 years for each. Thus, while the memecoins do get a lot of speculative activity, they have still managed to establish a userbase that’s as stubborn as that of Ethereum.

MicroStrategy is just 8% away from reaching a $50 billion market cap valuation.  Disclosure: The author of this story owns shares in MicroStrategy (MSTR).  Bitcoin {{BTC}}-holder MicroStrategy’s (MSTR) soaring stock is driving up trading volumes relative to AI-proxy Nvidia (NVDA), one of the biggest companies by market cap, reflecting heightened investor enthusiasm.  MSTR has surged over 240% this year, with prices doubling to $236 in the past five weeks alone, according to data source TradingView. That’s the highest level for the stock since the dotcom bubble 25 years ago. The rally has MSTR closing in on a market cap of $50 billion, barely 1.5% of NVDA’s $3.44 trillion.  However, MSTR’s trading volume, as a percentage against NVDA, has continued to climb this year, reaching a high of 17.65% this month. According to Investing.com data, this milestone occurred on Oct. 11, as MicroStrategy saw 30 million trading volume, while NVIDIA had 170 million.  That’s a significant improvement since the bull market of 2021. Back then, MSTR peaked over $130 on Feb. 9 with a volume of 23.2 million, equating to just 8% of NVDA that day.  An increase in trading volumes alongside a price rally may confirm the stock's uptrend. That said, a continued surge in volume relative to NVDA might be telling of a build up of a speculative froth in the market.  MicroStrategy outperforms Nvidia  With a year-to-date gain of over 240%, MSTR has outperformed NVDA’s 192% surge by a big margin. Since MSTR adopted bitcoin as a treasury asset in August 2020, the gap has grown even bigger, with MSTR up 1,800% versus NVDA’s 1,150%, that’s probably the best evidence of MicroStrategy and its CEO Michael Saylor’s success.

MEW Hits $1 Billion Market Cap After New ATH,"Cat in a dogs world (MEW) has taken the market by storm after becoming the second cat-themed memecoin to hit a $1 billion market capitalization. The token joined POPCAT’s rally and reached a new all-time high (ATH) on Thursday, leading the whole feline sector. Related Reading: Web3 Automation Provider Ava Protocol’s Demand Surges 900% Ahead Of Token Launch MEW Hits Major Milestones Cat in a dogs world registered a significant 18.4% surge in the last 24 hours, propelling to a new ATH twice this morning. The cryptocurrency recorded its fifth ATH in the past two weeks, increasing over 95.2% and taking the memecoin sector by storm. After its surge to $0.01127, the cryptocurrency hit the long-awaited $1 billion mark, becoming the second cat-themed token to achieve this feat. As a result, MEW flipped Base Network’s token Brett as the tenth largest memecoin by this metric. MEW initially joined the memecoin’s top ten list back in Q2, ranking 8th among the dog-themed pack. It significantly retraced as POPCAT’s popularity grew, registering a 60% correction after leading the cat-themed sector during Q1. Nonetheless, the cryptocurrency has been on an uptrend for the past month after hovering between the $0.004-$0.006 price range during most of Q3. MEW’s rally this week seems to be fueled by the token’s listing on the Korean crypto exchange Upbit. Market watcher Crypto General noted the memecoin’s recent performance, revealing its next target for MEW. The analyst highlighted that the cryptocurrency has been “in a consistent uptrend from its launch, showing great strength and potential.” Crypto General expects parabolic surges in the coming days, suggesting that the cryptocurrency will target the $0.045 range for its price discovery period. As of this writing, MEW traders at $0.0112, 1.1% below its ATH. Has The Cat Season Arrived? Many crypto analysts have previously suggested that a cat-themed memecoin season was coming. Solana’s feline leader, POPCAT, recorded a new ATH on Thursday after hitting the $1.67 mark. The memecoin has registered an 82% growth in the last thirty days, becoming the first cat-themed token to achieve the $1 Billion market cap milestone a month ago. Alongside MEW and POPCAT’s remarkable rally, other cat-inspired memecoins have seen a notable performance over the past week. BNB Chain-based token Simon’s Cat (CAT) recorded a massive surge in the past week, nearing its all-time high price on Wednesday. CAT’s price skyrocketed 80.4% in the last three days following its Future Listing on the crypto exchange Binance. Related Reading: SUI To Face Another Pullback Following 5.3% Dip, Analysts Forecast 30% Correction The price jumped from the $0.0000245 level to the $0.0000442 mark, trading just 5% below its $0.0000462 ATH registered over a month ago. Despite being down 5.1% from yesterday’s surge, CAT still registers a 53% weekly increase. Crypto Trader Bluntz stated that the “cat season is truly underway” as the whole sector soars over 8%, according to CoinGecko data.

42373402,0QIBFkzmrXAdmecZt58828,1729849754,Newly-Qualified Crypto Custodian Balance Aims to Bring ETF Assets Held in the U.S. Back to Canada,"Earlier this week, Canadian crypto custody specialist Balance announced it had become a qualified custodian in the country.  Balance CEO George Bordianu says it’s time to bring Canada’s ETF assets back home from sub-custody arrangements in the U.S. with Coinbase and Gemini.  Balance, Canada’s long-standing crypto custodian, finally attained qualified custodian status this week, prompting the firm’s CEO, George Bordianu, to say it’s time to start bringing the country’s ETF digital assets “back home.”  Bordianu is alluding to the fact that the safekeeping of crypto assets underlying funds issued by ETF providers 3iQ, Purpose Investments and Evolve, end up in sub-custody arrangements and held by blue chip U.S. exchanges like Coinbase and Gemini, rather than remaining on Canadian soil.  “We have billions worth of retail assets in Canada’s crypto ETFs that sit in the United States,” Bordianu said in an interview with CoinDesk. “We'd like to bring those assets back home. We're trying to simplify the picture, to make it cheaper and a little bit easier for new asset managers to do a few more ETF and mutual funds in Canada.”  Bordianu makes the case that Balance does not avail itself of sub-custody partnerships because the firm has become a qualified custodian based on the strength of its own home built technology stack, as opposed to using third party technology such as a Fireblocks or a Digital Vault.  The bigger picture concerns the growth of the crypto sector in Canada more broadly. The amount of crypto collectively held in Canada’s ETFs might not seem like a big deal right now, Bordianu says, but given the growth of things like tokenized real world assets and the proliferation of stablecoins, Canada needs to focus on building its own infrastructure to handle these assets.  “It’s like saying the Toronto Stock Exchange should plug into the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation in the U.S. to clear and settle all of their transactions through that foreign infrastructure,” Bordianu said. “If you put it in those terms, it sounds absolutely bonkers.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/10/25/newly-qualified-crypto-custodian-balance-aims-to-bring-etf-assets-held-in-the-us-back-to-canada,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/826273778181d94b18b99fb69860d43c3c61863a-5477x3081.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Despite these fluctuations, a CryptoQuant analyst under the pseudonym BaroVirtual has shared some encouraging long-term insights regarding whale activity. According to the analyst, whales—large holders of Bitcoin—now control approximately 670,000 BTC, the highest amount ever recorded. This accumulation phase by whales is being seen as a positive signal for Bitcoin’s long-term outlook. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Current Decline Could Be Temporary—Key Signs of A Rally Revealed Whale Continues Accumulation BaroVirtual emphasized that when whale holdings reach such high levels, Bitcoin tends to remain in a sideways trading pattern or experiences mild price declines. This accumulation phase, however, often serves as a precursor to significant upward movement in the cryptocurrency’s value. The analyst described this phase as the “calm before the storm,” suggesting that a major price surge could be on the horizon as whales gradually reduce their holdings. This pattern has historically led to long-term price increases for Bitcoin. BaroVirtual also warned of potential risks tied to the upcoming US presidential elections, noting that if Bitcoin fails to update its all-time high between the elections and late November, it could signal deeper issues within the current bull cycle. The post on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform read: Finally, if the all-time price high between the US presidential elections and November 28 (+/- 21 days) is not updated, this will indicate severe problems with the current bull cycle, and things will get ugly. Bitcoin Market Performance And Outlook In parallel with these developments, Bitcoin has seen a rebound in price following a recent dip that followed its attempt to break through the $70,000 level on Monday. After the correction, Bitcoin is currently trading at $67,658, marking a 2.4% increase in the past day. This price recovery aligns with technical signals indicating a potential continuation of the bull run. A well-known crypto analyst known as CryptoBullet recently noted on X that Bitcoin’s weekly Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator has crossed into bullish territory for the first time since October 2023. CryptoBullet highlighted that this setup is reminiscent of Bitcoin’s 2021 price action, which saw a similar vertical rally followed by a mid-term correction. However, unlike 2021’s deeper correction, the current phase has taken more time to unfold but has not been as severe. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Retests Bullish Channel At $65,000, Analyst Reveals What’s Next The analyst remains optimistic, predicting that Bitcoin will likely break out of its multi-month consolidation phase, leading to a new all-time high in price. #Bitcoin Weekly MACD crossed bullish for the first time since October 2023! 👀 But this picture reminds me a lot of 2021: same Vertical Rally (MACD peaked) followed by a painful Mid Term Correction (however, this time it’s not that deep, it just took more time).

42373403,0QIBFkzmrXAdmecZt58838,1729844750,The Popular $100K Year-End Goal for Bitcoin Has Less Than 10% Probability in Options Market,"The way BTC options trading on Deribit are currently priced suggests a 9.58% chance of prices rising above $100,000 by Dec. 27.  The possibility of prices rising to $82,000 is higher, according to one observer.  Options market probabilities can change quickly with market conditions.  As sophisticated and retail investors rally around the possibility of bitcoin's {{BTC}} price surging to at least $100,000 by the year-end, the options market tied to the cryptocurrency assigns a low probability of such a surge materializing.  At press time, the way options were priced on dominant exchange Deribit showed a 9.58% probability of BTC topping the $100,000 mark by the end of December, according to data source Deribit Metrics.  Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to purchase or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option confers the right to buy, representing a bullish bet, while a put protects against downside price swings.  The near 10% figure may seem puzzling to the bulls, given the market has moved beyond the supply overhang fears of the second and third quarters and is reportedly on an bullish trajectory, largely due to the Federal Reserve's renewed bias for interest rate cuts.  That said, it seems consistent with the steady bitcoin implied volatility, suggesting that market participants don't expect wild moves in the short term.  Deribit's bitcoin implied volatility index (DVOL), which shows expected price turbulence over 30 days in annualized terms, remains locked between the three-month range of 50% to 60%, well below the 2024 high of 85% hit in March.  Options-implied probabilities are calculated by using the Block-Scholes model or other pricing models that take into account factors like current spot market price, strike price, time to expiration, volatility, and the risk-free rate. Options-based probabilities are positively correlated with implied volatility: The greater the volatility, the higher the odds of bitcoin hitting certain levels.  $82K realistic possibility  Several traders recently told CoinDesk that prices could rise to around $80,000 by the end of the year, irrespective of who wins the pivotal U.S. election, due Nov. 5.  The options market does suggest a possibility of a 22% price swing in either direction by the end of December, which means scope for a rally above $80,000 by the year-end.  ""The current market implied volatility of BTC at-the-money options expiring on Dec. 27 is 54%, which means that in the best-case scenario, the price of BTC will rise by more than 22% to around $82,000 by the end of the year,"" Griffin Ardern, head of options trading and research at crypto financial platform BloFin told CoinDesk.  ""However, volatility is bi-directional, so an equivalent drop cannot be ruled out either,"" Ardern said.  Probabilities are just probabilities  Options market probabilities can change quickly with market conditions, meaning the odds of a move to $100,000 by the year-end could improve if implied volatility jumps and prices set new highs.  The impending U.S. presidential election due on Nov. 5 could have far-reaching regulatory implications for the digital assets industry and could inject volatility into the market. Currently, the supposedly-pro crypto Republican candidate Donald Trump is ahead of his rival, Democrat Kamala Harris, in election polls. The election result will be declared on Nov. 8.  ""A Harris or Trump victory is not fully priced in and crypto investors need to be ready for a lot of volatility either way. This reminds me of biotech stocks on the dates the FDA determines if the drugs are approved. These stocks either fly or crash on those days and you can typically bet something volatile will happen,"" Alexander Blume, CEO of the SEC-registered digital assets advisory Two Prime, said in an email.  Blume added that a Harris win wouldn't be positive, at least for some time, as traders anticipating a Trump victory could square off their leveraged bets, injecting bearish volatility into the bitcoin market.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/25/the-popular-100k-year-end-goal-for-bitcoin-has-less-than-10-probability-in-options-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/79c87ed24d9e6fb0695064744696769b7b958db8-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

EMURGO, a founding entity of Cardano, will be among ecosystem buildings developing tools and services to attract the BTC capital and, vice-versa, send ADA tokens to the Bitcoin network.  BitcoinOS claims to be the first to have verified ZK proofs on Bitcoin in April, and its Grail bridge uses that security infrastructure to allow assets to flow between blockchains more securely.  “These bridges only require a single honest participant within a pool of potentially hundreds of operators (1-of-n) in a decentralized, dynamic, and permissionless operator set for your funds to remain secure,” BitcoinOS said in its release.  Bridges are blockchain-based tools that allow for the transfer of assets between different network where they aren’t originally supported. Zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) is a cryptographic protocol allowing one party to prove if a statement is true without revealing additional information.  Bridges are among the most attacked and vulnerable crypto tools despite their large importance in the ecosystem. A ZKP-based bridge, in theory, cuts down on those security fears.

42373416,0QIBFkzmrXAdmecZt588B8,1729840600,Polymarket Trader Betting on Donald Trump Win Ends Up Getting 99% Odds,"An individual or entity caused a brief mispricing on Polymarket by buying over 4.5 million Trump contracts for the 2024 Presidential Election, pushing the odds to 99% for a portion of the purchase due to the mechanics of the order book.  This anomaly occurred despite the actual market odds being around 63% at the time, highlighting how large trades can temporarily skew betting odds on prediction platforms.  Republican Donald Trump’s presidential victory odds on Polymarket spiked to 99% for one entity briefly earlier Friday, data shows, as their constant buying led to a temporary mispricing in the order book.  The ""GCorttell93"" account purchased over 4.5 million Trump contracts in the “Presidential Election Winner 2024” market spending over $3 million in a short period. However, due to how the orderbook works, a tranche of $275,000 was filled at 99% odds - a leap from the actual 63% offered odds at the time.  The rest of their bets were placed at varying prices, such as a $129,000 tranche at 65.9 cents and a $102,000 tranche at 62.7 cents.  How did the slippage occur?  On Polymarket, the price of shares in any outcome reflects the market's current belief in the likelihood of that outcome. If a 'Yes' share for an event costs $0.60, the market interprets this as a 60% chance of that event occurring.  However, these odds are dynamic and change with each trade as Polymarket works on a blockchain-based order book that lists all the buy (bids) and sell (asks) orders for shares in an outcome.  Bids represent the highest price someone is willing to pay for a share, while asks are the lowest price at which someone is willing to sell.  This system allows for price discovery and provides liquidity. Users can place limit orders, where they specify the price they're willing to buy or sell, which might not execute immediately if there's no match.  However, a market buy may lead to someone's bids getting filled at much higher prices.  As such, the order book allows everyone to see the depth of market interest at different price points, showing where other traders are willing to transact. This helps determine any bet’s true market price (compared to a centralized betting marketplace where brokers handle odds).  The election winner bet is the largest Polymarket by traded volume as of Friday, with over $2.2 billion in transactions. Trump leads the odds at 63%, while traders have given Democrat Kamala Harris a 36% chance of winning.",NEUTRAL,없음,MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/25/polymarket-trader-betting-on-donald-trump-win-ends-up-getting-99-odds,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fbf25bec2220f16365287df226ab3e12393c4de2-5184x2916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

35117894,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649707,1729839649,Ethereum ‘Verge’ Upgrade To Simplify Running Nodes On Phones And Wearables,"In a post published on October 23, Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin shared details about ‘The Verge’ upgrade, which aims to make it easier to run validator nodes. New Ethereum Upgrade To Make Running Nodes Easier Buterin highlighted several issues currently facing the Ethereum network, particularly the high resource requirements needed to run Ethereum nodes. Related Reading: Ethereum Demand Driven By Use In On-Chain Applications, Token Transfers: CoinShares According to research from Paradigm, an Ethereum client needs to store “hundreds of gigabytes of state data” to verify transaction blocks. Further, this data requirement increases by almost 30 GB every year, leading to fewer entities being able to run validator nodes. Through ‘The Verge’ upgrade, running nodes can be made more accessible and less resource-intensive by leveraging two key innovations – stateless clients and cryptographic SNARKs (Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge). The uninitiated, stateless clients function as fully-verifying nodes without the intensive hardware requirement associated with typical Ethereum blockchain clients. Specifically, stateless clients only need a few gigabytes of storage, in contrast to the current requirement of over 1 terabyte (TB), which makes running a full node considerably resource-intensive. Buterin posits that stateless verification will “make fully-verifying the chain so computationally affordable that every mobile wallet, browser wallet, and even smart watch is doing it by default.” By reducing storage needs, stateless clients can democratize network participation, lowering entry barriers – especially for solo stakers – and enabling more entities to secure and validate transactions on the Ethereum network. Buterin Encourages Solo-Staking By Lowering Requirements Buterin has recently emphasized the importance of making Ethereum solo staking more accessible by lowering entry barriers, such as the minimum amount of ETH required to stake and reducing bandwidth demands. Related Reading: Ethereum Proposal EIP-7781 Promises Network Performance Boost – Here’s What To Expect Additionally, Buterin discussed the advantages of SNARKs in strengthening cryptographic verification and defending against the potential threat of quantum computing. SNARKs are sophisticated cryptographic proofs that enable users to verify blockchain data without downloading all its data. “Download some data, verify a SNARK, done,” Buterin summarizes. In the detailed blog post, Buterin also shed light on the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4762, which deals with stateless gas cost changes in the context of stateless verification. EIP-4762 seeks to adjust gas fees for resource-intensive cryptographic operations to maintain Ethereum network scalability and security. The proposal also introduces ‘multidimensional gas’, which charges different gas fees for call data, computation, and state access functions. Ethereum’s native token, ETH, has attracted increased institutional interest as the smart contract platform’s adoption grows. A recent survey shows that nearly 70% of institutional investors are involved in ETH staking. Despite the overall bullish outlook for Ethereum’s future, this optimism has not yet translated into significant price movement for ETH. Nevertheless, long-term ETH holders remain confident in the token’s long-term potential. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $2,526, up 1.7% in the past 24 hours.

Pennsylvania is a crucial state for both Republicans and Democrats, roughly 12% of the 13 million people who reside in the state hold crypto.  The bill, developed with the assistance of the bitcoin advocacy group Satoshi Action Fund (SAF), reflects a growing trend of states attempting to establish regulatory frameworks for the crypto industry.

Improbable claims that the blockchain will process over 400,000 transactions per second.  Improbable, the British metaverse technology company creating Yuga Labs’ Otherside platform, has said the Somnia blockchain will enter its DevNet phase in the coming weeks.  The blockchain will process over 400,000 transactions per second (TPS) with sub-second latency and low fees, as well as being Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible, according to Improbable.  “The blockchain [will] enable very, very high transaction throughput and the ability to put more things on-chain,” Improbable co-founder and CEO Herman Narula told CoinDesk.  “Over the last 10 years, no one has managed to build a high-performance blockchain. I think the incentives in the space have really skewed people towards short term wins, pumping tokens [and] not actually solving real problems,” he said, adding that average transaction volumes on some chains are in the single digits.  The project is spearheaded by the Virtual Society Foundation, which Improbable helped to initiate in March this year. It is funded by Improbable’s M2, a network of interoperable metaverses backed by investors such as a16z and SoftBank.  He said his team had spent the last two years researching and building new technology that allows for hundreds of thousands of transactions a second, which is “really essential for building any kind of real applications.”  In a tweet thread earlier this year, Narula said the industry needs a better layer one to build real metaverses at consumer scale.  He used the analogy of a restaurant to explain the current challenges. “Parallel execution means more waiters so more tables can be served, that's fine unless everyone's orders start referring to everyone else’s orders… then things go horribly wrong. This needs a very different solution, one that is surprisingly similar to what we needed to do to handle billions of movement updates when a crowd exists in a single spot.” he said.  “Therefore our plan is not more waiters… to use a non technical analogy, we intend to give a single waiter a whole bunch of drugs to make them go faster...

35115669,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649720,1729834246,Bitcoin Price Dynamics: Analyzing The Effect of Trump’s Political Agenda On Crypto Markets,"Amid the surge in polls in favor of former President and Republican candidate Donald Trump over Vice President Kamala Harris, expectations for a further recovery of the Bitcoin price soared, but the rally seen in late September and the first weeks of October has faded, with experts attributing it to tightening financial conditions that could affect the broader crypto market. How Trump’s Campaign And Rising Yields Impact Bitcoin Price According to a recent Bloomberg report, Bitcoin’s association with Trump is becoming more pronounced as global markets react to his potential return to the White House. Nonetheless, the financial landscape is shifting, with rising bond yields and a strengthening dollar coinciding with Trump’s lead in prediction markets. Experts anticipate that a Trump victory could usher in a pro-growth economic agenda, thereby tightening monetary policy. Related Reading: Bitcoin MACD Turns Bullish Since 2023: Predictions Of Cycle Top And Next Bear Market Bottom Market analysts, such as Tony Sycamore from IG Australia Pty, emphasize that the current selloff in stocks and a stronger US dollar and rising yields signal tightening financial conditions. The analyst explains that this environment is generally unfavorable for the Bitcoin price and the broader crypto market, which tends to thrive in more liquid market conditions. Sycamore went on to say that while the initial monetary conditions were already loose, the speed of the tightening poses a significant threat to the Bitcoin price and other risk assets as the likelihood of Trump securing another term in the Oval Office increases. Regulatory Easing Under Trump’s Return? Trump’s campaign has openly embraced the cryptocurrency sector, promising to position the US as the “crypto capital of the world.” His approach starkly contrasts Harris’s more cautious stance, which involves supporting a regulatory framework to foster industry growth while ensuring consumer protection. The recent Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll reveals that Trump and Harris are statistically tied among likely voters in key swing states, indicating that the upcoming election could hinge on targeted advertising, rallies, and grassroots efforts—all of which could influence market sentiment. In the crypto market, investors are increasingly betting on a potential victory for former President Donald Trump on Polymarket. Current polls show Trump leading with 62% support compared to 38% for Vice President Kamala Harris as of Thursday, marking the largest margin since the race began. Related Reading: XRP Price Aims to Recover: Can It Reverse the Downtrend? Should Trump win in the upcoming election, Bloomberg notes that experts predict a potential yield increase, which could negatively impact risk assets, including the Bitcoin price performance. Caroline Mauron, co-founder of Orbit Markets, points out that while higher yields may pose challenges, the anticipated regulatory easing under a Trump administration could be pivotal in shaping the crypto landscape. Despite potential economic challenges that could negatively impact BTC’s performance, Mauron concludes that the regulatory shift could support Bitcoin and other digital assets in regaining their footing. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $67,670, up 2.4% over the past 24 hours.

The price could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $0.1425 and $0.1450 resistance levels. Dogecoin Price Eyes Upside Break Dogecoin price started a downside correction from the $0.1500 resistance zone. DOGE dipped below $0.1450 and $0.1420 levels. A low was formed at $0.1330 and the price is now recovering losses like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was also a move above the $0.1350 and $0.1380 resistance levels. The price surpassed the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1482 swing high to the $0.1330 low. However, the bears are active near the $0.1425 resistance zone. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.1425 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. The trend line is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1482 swing high to the $0.1330 low. Dogecoin price is now trading below the $0.1420 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.1425 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.1450 level. A close above the $0.1450 resistance might send the price toward the $0.1500 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.1550 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.1585. Another Decline In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.1425 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1365 level. The next major support is near the $0.1350 level. The main support sits at $0.1320. If there is a downside break below the $0.1320 support, the price could decline further.

The price must clear the $0.5400 and $0.5500 resistance levels to gain pace. XRP price is correcting losses from the $0.5120 zone. The price is now trading below $0.5380 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a short-term bearish trend line with resistance at $0.5280 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $0.5360 resistance zone. XRP Price Faces Many Hurdles XRP price remained in a bearish zone and extended losses below $0.5300, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a move below the $0.5280 and $0.5250 levels. The price even dipped below $0.5200 and tested $0.5120. A low was at $0.5117 and the price is now attempting to recover losses.

A clear move above the $0.5485 resistance might send the price toward the $0.5500 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.5550 resistance or even $0.5620 in the near term. The next major hurdle might be $0.5650. Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $0.5360 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5230 level. The next major support is near the $0.5185 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5185 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $0.5120 support in the near term.

35113453,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649679,1729828857,Tron Energy Needs Rise 100% In 3 Months: New All-Time High Incoming?,"Tron is now in the top 10 blockchains by market cap, flipping Toncoin and Cardano. While there were initial doubts about the network dying a natural death due to the then “superior” competitor Ethereum in the first few years, the smart contracts platform has surpassed expectations. Tron Energy Demand Doubles In 3 Months At spot rates, is TRX likely to print fresh all-time highs, and the mainnet is also thriving. According to IntoTheBlock, the Tron energy requirements have expanded 100% in the past three months. Related Reading: $200,000 Bitcoin In 2025? $791 Billion Asset Manager Calls It ‘Conservative’ Experts say the rapid increase in Tron energy indicates growing network activity and rapid adoption. Like Ethereum and other modern chains, Tron is energy efficient and relies on validators for transaction processing. However, in Tron’s case, energy is useful when executing smart contracts on the mainnet. As more people deploy meme coins or launch DeFi dapps, the mainnet’s “fuel” demand also increases. Rising resource needs push Tron energy to fresh levels. By how Tron is designed, more energy is needed during periods of high demand to prevent gas fees from spiking in case transactions are congested. That energy has been rising in the past few months is not surprising. Not only does Tron boast of a thriving DeFi ecosystem, but it also has a vibrant meme coin scene. Ecosystem Boom Driven By Meme Coins: TRX Priming For New All-Time Highs? DeFiLlama shows that all Tron DeFi dapps manage over $7 billion of assets. On the other hand, the recent launch of SunPump, a meme coin launchpad in August, has seen over 91,000 meme coins deploy on the network. Looking at Dune, over 1,700 tokens have been listed on Sunswap. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Retests Bullish Channel At $65,000, Analyst Reveals What’s Next Coincidentally, the spike came with the activation of SunPump in August. As of October 24, SunPump has helped Tron generate over $5.4 million in revenue, looking at Dune data. Others came from smart contract deployments via gaming, DeFi, and other diverse dapps on the platform. TRX is trading at around October 2024 highs at press time, defying gravity. Interestingly, despite the momentum challenges Ethereum faces, TRX, on the other hand, is less than 4% away from all-time highs. If bulls build on October 24 gains, the coin may easily break August highs, printing a new all-time high in Q4 2024.

Key Data Suggests New Investors Hold the Key","Bitcoin recent decline has led to a slight pushback in investor confidence and increased anticipation within the crypto community, with many now craving a rally back above $70,000 more than before. Amid this, a new analysis suggests that although the Bitcoin market could be on the brink of a major breakout, it hinges on a major indicator that concerns new investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Network Fundamentals Turn Bullish—Here Are The Details New Investors Hold the Key According to a CryptoQuant analyst, Avocado Onchain, new market investors could drive the next significant upward price movement. The analyst shared these insights on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, highlighting key data trends that point to a potential price surge. Avocado Onchain’s analysis focuses on “Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs),” specifically those under six months old. UTXOs represent the amount of cryptocurrency that remains unspent after a transaction, and they can provide valuable insights into market sentiment. According to the analyst, the decline in UTXOs under six months has stopped and is now leveling off. Currently, only 8.6% of Bitcoin investors are at a loss based on the present price of the cryptocurrency. In past market cycles, when the decline in UTXOs halted and showed an increase, Bitcoin’s price often surged, marking the beginning of a new bull run. Bitcoin Historical Patterns And Market Sentiment The CryptoQuanat analyst further highlighted that the data from previous Bitcoin market cycles reveals a pattern in which the percentage of investors holding losses converged toward zero before significant price increases occurred. Avocado points out that in those instances, as the number of investors in loss diminished, new investors entered the market in large numbers, driven by rising optimism. This influx of new participants tends to trigger a sharp price rise as new buyers increase demand for Bitcoin and fuel further upward momentum. For Bitcoin’s price to reach new heights, the analyst suggests that market sentiment must shift more favorably. This positive sentiment is typically fuelled by the entry of new investors who tend to buy in when market conditions are improving. Related Reading: Bitcoin Profitability Index Hits 202%: Is This Enough For A Top? Avocado also highlights that these new investors often show increased interest when Bitcoin nears or breaks through its previous all-time high, leading to an “explosive influx” of new buyers. If Bitcoin’s current market conditions align with historical patterns, the cryptocurrency could be on the verge of a significant breakout. The CryptoQuant analyst further notes that while Bitcoin’s price has recently been in a downtrend, this leveling off of UTXO data is a key sign that could indicate a reversal. The analyst noted: If history repeats itself, the current price of Bitcoin could be seen as being on the verge of an explosive breakout.

35108839,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649627,1729818025,Is Too Late To Accumulate Bitcoin? What This Indicator Says,"Here’s what the historical pattern of an on-chain indicator suggests regarding whether the time to accumulate Bitcoin is over or not. Bitcoin 150-Day MA aSOPR Currently Has A Value Of 1.01 As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the 150-day moving average (MA) of the Bitcoin aSOPR has a value of just 1.01 right now. The “Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio” (aSOPR) here refers to an indicator that basically tells us about whether the BTC investors are selling their coins at a profit or loss. This metric works by going through the on-chain history of all tokens being sold/transferred to see what price they were transacted at prior to this. When this price for any coin is less than the current price at which they are now being sold, then that particular token’s sale could be assumed to be leading to profit realization. Related Reading: Analytics Firm Reveals Why Dogecoin & Apecoin Hit Tops Similarly, coins of the opposite type could be considered to be adding to the loss realization. The aSOPR combines such profits and losses being realized across the network, and calculates their ratio. The “adjusted” in this metric’s name comes from the fact that it filters out transactions of coins that were moved inside an hour of their last transaction. Transfers like these are generally of no consequence to the wider market, so it makes sense to take them out of the data. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 150-day MA of the Bitcoin aSOPR over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the 150-day MA Bitcoin aSOPR has consistently remained above the 1 mark this year, which implies the investors as a whole have been realizing more profits than losses. Earlier in the year, the indicator had grown to a high of 1.04 as the investors had taken the profits of the rally. As the consolidation of the cryptocurrency has dragged on, though, the metric has declined, with its value now sitting at 1.01. In the chart, the quant has highlighted two zones that have historically been significant for the aSOPR. The first is the region under 0.98, where bottoms have historically occurred. At levels this low, the investors are participating in notable loss realization. Resolute hands pick up the coins from these capitulators, thus helping the price reach a point of turnaround. Related Reading: Bitcoin Profitability Index Hits 202%: Is This Enough For A Top? The other zone is the one above 1.08, where tops have formed in the past as a result of the aggressive profit-taking from the whales. So far, the current cycle hasn’t seen the Bitcoin aSOPR visit this territory. “Based on previous trends, accumulating Bitcoin until aSOPR reaches 1.04 could be a solid strategy for long-term gains,” says the analyst. “Timing the market by observing whale behavior may prove fruitful.” BTC Price Bitcoin had plunged to the $65,000 level yesterday, but the coin has already made recovery as its price is now floating around $67,100.
