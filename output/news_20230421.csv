The first product at Gemini Foundation, as the new division is called, will be a perpetual bitcoin (BTC) contract denominated in Gemini dollars (GUSD), the company said, followed by a perpetual ether (ETH) contract also linked to GUSD. Unlike conventional derivatives, perpetuals don't have an expiration date.  The decision coincides with U.S. regulators getting stricter about cryptocurrencies in the world's biggest economy – a campaign that's affected Gemini. In January, the company and Genesis (which, like CoinDesk, is owned by Digital Currency Group) were accused by the Securities and Exchange Commission of selling unregistered securities.  Rival crypto exchange Coinbase, which is also facing regulatory action in the U.S., would consider moving away from the country if the rules the industry must abide by do not become clearer, CEO Brian Armstrong said this week.

Still, some funds associated with the scam are reportedly being regularly sent to mixers and liquidated at spot rates, impacting prices. However, whether the Chinese government still holds these assets remain unknown. There is no official Bitcoin address to verify the status of these coins. PlusToken Scam was a global Ponzi scheme targeting Chinese and South Korean investors. It started in April 2018, taking advantage of unsuspecting people who thought they could make quick money from an investment opportunity. All users had to pay for registration using cryptocurrencies, mainly BTC, before investing. Perpetrators said they were developing cryptocurrency products. Six Chinese nationals were arrested in Vanuatu and extradited to China to face the law in June 2019. A year later, the Chinese Ministry of Public Security said they arrested other suspects, recovering over $3 billion of crypto assets. United States Is A Crypto Leader Cryptocurrency trading and related operations, including mining, are banned in China. Therefore, whether Chinese authorities will “trade” these cryptocurrencies for other assets is unclear for now.

11991597,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=528032,1682110826,XRP Correction Continues: Elliott Waves Theory Predicts Wave 2 At $0.38,"Since reaching its yearly high of $0.5842 on March 29th, XRP has experienced a significant price drop. The token has lost its bullish momentum and failed to breach higher levels, disappointing investors who were optimistic about the uptrend of one of the largest cryptocurrencies in the market. It is worth noting that XRP’s recent price drop is part of a wider market correction affecting the entire cryptocurrency market. Despite this, trader and crypto analyst “Dark Defender” believes that there is still further correction ahead for XRP. Related Reading: Is The Final Shakeout Moment Coming For Bitcoin? Expert Weighs In No Signs Of Recovery For XRP? On April 1st, Dark Defender made a bold prediction for the price of XRP based on Elliott Waves theory. According to Dark Defender, the token completed its first wave (W1) at around $0.59 and is expected to enter a second wave (W2) that will find support between $0.48 and $0.38. As of now, there have been no changes to Dark Defender’s prediction, and XRP remains in correction unless it breaks its resistance level of $0.59 and stays above it for three consecutive days. Dark Defender has provided a list of support levels for XRP, including $0.4812, $0.45544, $0.42044, and $0.38813. The analyst believes that XRP will finish this last correction at one of these levels before targeting the $3 mark. Furthermore, the analyst has provided a bullish prediction for XRP’s future, stating that the third wave (W3) of this structure is expected to reach between $2 and $3.47 by the end of this year. However, this wave 3 above $1.33 will be the predecessor of the Grand Wave 3. In scenario 2, Dark Defender predicts that XRP will continue to rise in value. As of this writing, XRP is currently trading at $0.4582, which represents a drop of over 2.6% in the last 24 hours. On wider time frames, the token has recorded significant drops of 11% and 9.2% in the seven and fourteen-day time frames, respectively. This means that if Dark Defender’s prediction is correct, XRP may still have plenty of downtrends to experience, potentially reaching the lower lows of March 21st at $0.380. XRP’s Wide Adoption Continues To Increase XRP has been gaining traction in recent months, with its unique utility in cross-border payments attracting attention from financial institutions and investors, which has been raising with its continuous innovations to provide a better service to its users. According to pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton, Uphold, a digital platform that allows users to buy, sell, and hold various cryptocurrencies and traditional currencies, currently holds $1.04 billion in XRP, making XRP the single largest asset holding on the platform. This amount is significantly greater than Uphold’s Bitcoin holdings, which currently stand at $131 million. In addition, the token volume accounted for 28.33% of total transactions on Uphold’s platform.

42420755,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqj9x,1682110389,Decentralized Media Is Breaking Barriers in a Web2 World,"On April 7, community-owned Web3 crypto news show company Coinage put forth its first governance vote. The proposal asked community members of Coinage’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to decide whether or not they should move 10% of the DAO’s treasury into the meme coin DOGE.  “Coinage haz much money in ETH but DOGE go ⬆️. Does DOGE haz much fortune?? Go wayz up???” the proposal reads.  The vote closed after 72 hours, with 60% (140 votes) against the investment and 40% (94 votes) in favor.  Zack Guzman, co-founder of Trustless Media, the company behind Coinage, voted in favor of the DOGE investment idea but was happy with the outcome because it showed that Coinage was truly decentralized.  “I think the first vote has proven this decentralized model works, where even I didn't get what I wanted,” Guzman told CoinDesk.  Decentralized media has become a prominent point of conversation among Web2 and Web3-native journalists alike. While covering cryptocurrency news is one thing, using Web3 tools to expand journalistic practices is another.  Some builders in the space feel that media distribution has become too focused on numbers, traffic and ad sales instead of creating content for its audience. Rather than publishing to generate revenue, what if the content was created with readers in mind, publications were co-governed by its audience and the nature of the media industry became more collaborative?  Several journalists who have spent years in Web2 media are seeking to shake up the industry and usher in a new Web3 era.  NFT Now and tokenized media  When non-fungible token (NFT) publication NFT Now launched nearly two years ago, its founders identified issues within the traditional media landscape they hoped to fix.  “We were intimately aware of just how broken the Web2 media model is,” said Matt Medved, CEO, editor-in-chief and co-founder of NFT Now. “That is something that from the very beginning … we knew that we wanted to do something and we wanted to do it differently.”  Medved was previously the editor-in-chief at music publication Spin Magazine and founded Billboard Magazine’s Billboard Dance. Believing that the Web2 media industry is overly motivated by revenue streams that are misaligned with audience interest, he’s made an effort to build NFT Now into a “true” Web3 publication through its content and publishing strategy.  Medved said that NFT Now has committed to never running programmatic ads, implementing cookies or tracking user data. It’s been slowly building its community ahead of the launch of the Now Pass, a non-fungible token that allows token holders to deepen their roots within the NFT Now community and media ecosystem.  “The Now Pass is the access pass to the Now Network, and the Now Network is our foundation for all of our initiatives to build the future of tokenized media,” said Medved. “The Now Pass is that first step for us in pioneering this community-centric media model, and starting to really redefine what the role is for a media brand in a Web3 environment.”  The Now Pass opened up its mint on March 23, selling 2,750 tokens for 0.25 ether (ETH), or about $500 each. It sold out in less than 48 hours, raising nearly $1.1 million to build out the publication’s steps into tokenized media.  Thus far, the Now Pass grants holders access to a Discord channel and “Alpha Chat” to share news and insights between members. It also allows holders to attend events, such as the NFT100 gala and an inaugural community meet-up held in New York during NFT.NYC.  Medved told CoinDesk that in the coming months, NFT Now will establish a membership portal where holders can earn rewards for their participation in the ecosystem. In addition, there are plans for an on-chain voting system for content curation and more token-gated events to bring community members together.  Enter the Dirtyverse  For a Web3 media organization to succeed, it needs to understand its audience and how to onboard readers to new technologies.  That’s how Dirt, a Web3-native publication, has risen in popularity over the past year and garnered praise from culture fanatics and NFT collectors alike.  Founded in 2021 by journalists Daisy Alioto and Kyle Chayka, Dirt aims to break down Web2 media regimes by publishing content from a network of freelancers, using blockchain infrastructure to keep media decentralized.  Alioto told CoinDesk that Dirt doesn’t exclusively cover cryptocurrency, making it one of the only Web3-native media organizations to report on a broader scope of content.  “The blockchain is simply a tool to re-architect the relationship between the subscriber and the publication,” said Alioto. “If you understand how to create compelling intellectual property and a network around it, you can build anything you want on those rails.”  Since Dirt launched in 2021 it has not only raised $1.2 million in seed funding, but it’s grown a community that engages with its content, which Alioto says has been called “the child of Vice and The New Yorker.” It has built its free newsletter that has 23,000 subscribers, but has found other ways to monetize content through NFTs.  Its annual subscription NFTs grant its 229 holders access to token-gated Discord channels to discuss topics such as movies, books and recipes, among other things. Dirt has also sold 322 Founder Passes, NFTs that grant holders a lifetime subscription to the publication as well as privileges to vote on content that Dirt produces.  Alioto told CoinDesk that Dirt has demonstrated how Web3 can create collectibility and credibility in media, bringing people to Dirt who were previously not represented by existing media infrastructure. She’s bullish on the future of Web3 media as Dirt expands its brand verticals.  “I have a vision for the future of media-centric businesses that has remained consistent for almost two years, and people who disagreed with me in the bull market are now scrambling to roll out newsletters and zines and airdrop free whatever,” said Alioto. “It doesn't work that way. You either have the sauce or you don't. The future is dirty.”  Coinage and co-owned media  While the proposal to move dogecoin into the Coinage treasury didn’t proceed as Guzman had hoped, the outcome showed how the decentralized media company is co-owning and co-creating its brand with its community.  Coinage, which Guzman co-founded in 2022 after years covering finance and cryptocurrency at Yahoo Finance and CNBC, pivoted to producing Web3 media with holistic Web3 roots.  In its first year, Coinage not only produced a Society of American Business Editors and Writers award-winning television show on cryptocurrency (see this interview with Terra founder Do Kwon on the stablecoin’s death spiral) but also empowers the community to help shape the content the show produces.  “The earliest users make Coinage valuable, and in any media company that's a pretty important number,” said Guzman. “Delivering value back to your earliest subscribers is essentially what we're doing, which is pretty Web3 and cool.”  In order to build a Web3 community around its show, Coinage has released three different tiers of NFTs. The Network membership passes, distributed at Coinage’s launch, help to fund and give holders the ability to co-own the content of the show. In addition, Subscriber membership passes allow exclusive access to Coinage’s content before it gets released to the public on YouTube and Caucus passes allow holders to weigh in on the topics that Coinage covers.  Among Coinage’s NFT holders is Marc Randolph, co-founder of Netflix.  “Randolph revolutionized the idea of media once before, and having someone like that excited by what we're building is pretty cool,” said Guzman. “One of the main reasons why he's intrigued by it is the thesis of breaking down the wall between your favorite content creator and their audience, and that unlocks a bunch of powerful network effects.”  While Coinage produces weekly shows covering a wide variety of cryptocurrency-related topics, it's beginning to take its first steps in building out community governance, authoring proposals and asking token holders which topics they would like to see covered before putting them to a vote.  In its most recent governance vote that concluded on April 17, 73% of members (76 votes) elected to cover the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the regulatory crackdown that the crypto industry has been facing over the past month.  Where is Web3 media going?  While the content may not always be focused on crypto, Web3 media is primarily emerging from publications native to the space. Still, the incentives for Web2 media companies to start experimenting with technologies such as NFTs and DAOs are growing.  There’s already a movement brewing among major media publications to implement Web3 technologies into their content distribution methods.  In February, men’s magazine GQ announced its first NFT collection. The GQ3 Issue 001: Change Is Good collection included a magazine subscription, GQ merchandise and an invitation to its party that was held last week during NFT.NYC.  Other publications that have dipped their toes into NFTs include CNN’s now-defunct Vault NFT marketplace as well as Time Magazine’s TIMEPieces collection that allows readers to collect digital artworks that serve as a membership to the publication.  As more Web3 media outlets continue to spring up, more Web2 publications may be motivated to make the switch to stay competitive and bring added value to their audiences.",POSITIVE,DOGE | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | DOGE | ETH | REGULATION,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/decentralized-media-is-breaking-barriers-in-a-web2-world,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/30aeab5adbefbc90adf4bc20b1aaeca66c375a3a-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420750,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqj5p,1682108099,Consensus Pitchfest 2023: Finance for the Unbanked,"For all the noise surrounding cryptocurrency markets, crypto has always offered something fundamental to human progress: an open, democratic financial system. Despite all the meme coins and joke products, there are still many testing the power of crypto to provide the easy access to resources to the world’s 1.4 billion unbanked people.  Gane, a freemium mobile provider, is one such firm that reaffirms our faith in this technology. Co-founded by Henry Baiz, Gane aims to make mobile services accessible to everyone by providing free cellphone services using Web3 wallets. (It is a contender in CoinDesk’s Pitchfest, happening next week at the Consensus festival.)  Through its service, customers can interact, learn skills and earn tokens that can eventually be swapped for free voice, text and data. “Today, with just two minutes a day on Gane [app], you can get 2 gigs [of data] a month,” said Baiz in a CoinDesk interview.  As of now, Gane is the first free mobile carrier in Latin America, with goals to expand in the United States, where many still use prepaid mobile services. Its services can also be used for easy and quick remittances globally.  “One out of every five weeks a [prepaid] user has no outgoing service, they only have Wi-Fi and incoming calls. Isn't that sad?” added Baiz, affirming the need for more accessible service options in the world.  Representatives from Gane are coming CoinDesk’s Pitchfest to talk more about its future. There the firm will get an opportunity to showcase how innovation in crypto can make the world a more financially inclusive space.  Speaking of financial inclusion innovation, Stable, a consumer app that offers global remittances and peer-to-peer payments, is also pitching at Pitchfest. Using Stable, customers can send money globally using the company's stable token and withdraw it in a fiat currency. One does not have to worry about the volatility of crypto using it.  “The whole [point] of Stable is risk dispersion and to a select basket of stablecoins, so the people don't buy and hold a specific stablecoin, but they have a stable token which [can only be traded] in our ecosystem,” co-founder Alvaro Jose Mosquera, said in a CoinDesk interview.  Today, the firm is focused on establishing trust and transparency in the market while safeguarding the most important asset of its customers – their money.  “We’re bringing back trust in a way that is auditable,” said Mosquera in an interview with CoinDesk, explaining that every dollar in Stable’s reserve is backed by a mixture of digital and fiat currencies, making it a reliable service for its customers.  As Stable continues to grow, its presence in CoinDesk’s Pitchfest will allow many to witness the firm’s game-changing plan to make global remittances easy, safe and not daunting for the average customer.  Financial inclusion isn’t the only challenge that contestants in the Pitchfest are taking on. Boto, a no-code platform for creating and sharing bots that automate decentralized finance (DeFi) activities, is on a mission to increase technical transparency for its users.  Boto allows its users to build automation by simply picking and dragging blocks that consume machine-readable information. One can find several “recipes” on its platform that help you perform Web3-related tasks, including tracking NFT sales and mints, without requiring you to code.  Alongside Boto, Magic Square, a discovery and Web3 platform will also present at the Consensus Pitchfest. This firm brings accessibility to Web3, making it effortless for its users to find new applications and games on it. Think of it as the Apple Store of Web3.  Magic Square’s user-friendly interface allows users to explore without compromising on their privacy and security. Additionally, the firm has over 300 listed apps and offers dynamic incentives to its users.  At Pitchfest 2023, these firms are bringing their game-changing innovations to showcase to the world that crypto is more than a technological revolution, it is a tool of empowerment that creates a safe, inclusive and accessible society.

But even the most draconian of clampdowns will not crush crypto, said Gün Sirer, whose company developed the Avalanche (AVAX) layer-1 blockchain.  “Suppose we ban crypto altogether?” he said. “Generation Z is digital-first, and they will not allow this technology to go away. They have seen how amazing these new rails can be.”  Several areas, Gün Sirer said, need to improve in order to get the next billion users into crypto, such as scalability, ease of use and adaptability. However, when asked about the feasibility of the secret sharing technology known as zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) to reach that scale, he was skeptical.  “This space is often waiting for the next shiny new thing, which I call ‘Godot’ solutions,” Gün Sirer said, in reference to Samuel Beckett’s absurdist play ""Waiting for Godot,"" where the main protagonists are endlessly waiting for the arrival of something that never comes.  “If something doesn’t work today, there is usually a very good reason for that,” he said. “ZKPs are fantastic tech but for scalability they are completely unproven. I have friends who are working on this, and I wish them the best. But if it does work, the latency will always be greater, and I worry about the user experience.”",NEUTRAL,AVAX,AVAX | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/04/21/ava-labs-ceo-calls-for-crypto-regulators-who-can-read-and-audit-code,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6168d4e4fd0c63da2e1a744db68f02b72f16260b-4030x2267.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42420736,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqiuT,1682107700,Ethereum’s Shanghai Upgrade Spurs Institutional Investment Into Staking,"Early signs show that Ethereum’s seamless Shanghai upgrade has spurred institutional investors’ interest in staking.  Top institutional-grade ether (ETH) staking service providers have already recorded about three times larger inflows in April compared to all of last month, Michiel Milanovic, analyst of Ethereum blockchain developer firm ConsenSys, told CoinDesk. Some 80% of the inflows happened after the Shanghai upgrade went live on April 12, he added.  Ethereum’s highly anticipated tech update, often referred to as the Shanghai or Shapella upgrade, starting April 12 enabled withdrawals of some 18 million tokens, worth $35 billion, previously locked up in staking contracts. After the upgrade, ETH’s price rallied to $2,100, its highest level in 11 months, defying earlier concerns the unlocking could lead to significant selling pressure and a price crash. The token recently has dropped below $1,900, aligning with a broader crypto market decline.  Allowing withdrawals also reduced the liquidity risk associated with locking up ETH for staking, which has kept some investors at bay before. “We expect this to naturally increase staking rates after the initial drawdown of ETH from long-term validators,” Milanovic said.  According to a survey by Kiln, an institutional-grade staking service provider, 68% of investors said they intend to start staking or increase their staked amount after Shanghai. The survey was conducted in February, before the Shanghai upgrade.  Thomas de Phuoc, Kiln’s co-founder and chief operating officer, said the firm experienced a fresh wave of interest in staking, even from traditional finance (TradFi) firms.  “Our sales team noted 60% more deals in the pipeline than at the same time last year, including from traditional institutions,” Phuoc said. “We are discussing at the moment with some brokerage firms, investment banking services holding companies in the U.S. or in Europe.”  Kiln has recorded $47 million (24,640 ETH) of new deposits since the Shanghai upgrade, according to a Dune dashboard by crypto venture fund Dragonfly’s analyst.  Rival platform Staked.us booked $111 million (58,592 ETH) in inflows, more than double the $51 million (26,667 ETH) of staking rewards withdrawn, per Dune data.  Still, it is early to draw definite conclusions, Milanovic noted, because not all staking providers have enabled withdrawals immediately.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/21/ethereums-shanghai-upgrade-spurs-institutional-investment-into-staking,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/984ba9187bd8e821f0c063127713086e62dd33f1-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to the creator of the Bollinger Bands, it’s once again “time to pay attention” — this time because BTCUSD has pulled back to a “logical” level. Bitcoin Begins Pullback To Logical Level Bitcoin reached almost double from current bear market lows, nearly convincing the crypto community a new bullish trend had begun. With BTCUSD now down more than 10% from local highs, fear is already back on the air in a major way. Bulls are now all but silent, after just recently declaring the bull market has returned. Bears are already celebrating the correction as continuation of the bearish trend getting underway. Related Reading: Brace Yourself: The Most Explosive Move In Bitcoin In Years Has Begun More tactical technicians, like John Bollinger, simply believe it’s “time to pay attention,” and haven’t yet taken a side. The quote has become a bit of a catchphrase for the creator of the Bollinger Bands. But what exactly is he talking about? The creator of the Bollinger Bands has spoken | BTCUSD on TradingView.com All About The Bollinger Bands The Bollinger Bands are a volatility measuring tool. The tool’s creator recently pointed out an expansion after a lengthy phase or narrowing. This behavior is referred to as a “squeeze” and suggests an uptick in volatility is ahead. Which is precisely what we are witnessing now. Volatility is the measure of price dispersion across a timeframe, and after very little movement, BTCUSD is like a rollercoaster once again. Ups and downs are par for the course. Related Reading: This “Super” Bitcoin Technical Tool Says Limited Resistance Remains The Bollinger Bands are made up of a 20-period simple moving average (SMA), to where price pulled back to and has now broken below. The upper and lower bands are set at two standard deviations of the SMA. The next logical level to look for support would be the lower band, located at around $27,000. Once Bitcoin hits the level it could continue downward with strength or snap back to the top of the band. One thing is for sure, the tool predicting volatility was accurate. Now it’s time to pay attention. As a journalist I often cover the greatest calls by the best in the biz. As a trader, I never forget the corresponding price action, allowing me to learn at every turn. Same vibes.

Coinmarketcap data reveals the token to be trading at $8.77 at the time of writing, a significant drop from where it was in price yesterday. The TORN token and its decentralized mixing service platform became controversial when its developer, Alexey Pertev, was arrested mid-last year allegedly for money laundering. However, news about the possible jail release of Alexey circulated the industry yesterday, April 20, and created a rally for the TORN token. Related Reading: FTT Token On a 8% Rockslide Despite FTX Ray Of Hope. Here’s Why Tornado Cash Developer Set To Be Released On This Date According to a recent report, the developer of the TORN token, Alexey Pertev, is expected to be released on April 26, 2023, after spending nine months in detention without trial. The news of his potential release came yesterday when the crypto markets were declining. However, the Tornado Cash token reacted to the news of Alexey’s release and defied market conditions by displaying bullish price action. While the rally drew investors’ attention, the token could not continue its upward movements today despite positive price speculations by crypto experts and analysts. Alexey Pertev, who is set to be released next Wednesday, will await trial from his home as ruled by a court in the Netherlands. Upon his release, electronic monitoring devices such as an ankle bracelet will be installed on him and other monitoring devices in his home, according to the report. At the time of writing, the TORN token is currently ranked among the top 3 losers in the cryptocurrency market. Alexey Pertev’s release date is approaching, and we may witness Tornado Cash reacting in price as it did with the news about his release.

42420740,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqixZ,1682106054,Aptos Introduces Delegated Staking to Increase Participation in Staking on Network,"Layer 1 blockchain Aptos has introduced a feature that aims to make staking on its network more accessible, according to a Thursday blog post.  The new offering, delegated staking, allows users to earn staking rewards without running nodes themselves. It also lowers the amount of the blockchain’s native token, aptos (APT), needed to participate in staking. Now users will only need 11 APT, worth roughly $117 at publication time, to stake their tokens with the blockchain.  “Delegated staking ensures that token holders continue to hold ownership of their APT in their own wallets, and do not have to resort to off-chain methods of funds aggregation,” the blog reads.  With delegated staking, users can enlist the help of a trusted validator to stake for them. In this way, token holders profit from locking up their crypto for predetermined periods of time without needing to obtain special hardware or pay a fee to run code to verify blockchain transactions.  Participants can stake APT directly in the Aptos Explorer or choose from staking interfaces created by the blockchain’s partners, such as Pontem Network and Nodes Guru.  APT is trading at $10.65, down 2% from its price 24 hours ago, according to CoinGeck data.

42420759,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqjC1,1682103407,The Most Intense Consensus Ever Seeks Everyone’s Voice,"I’ve attended eight out of nine Consensus events since 2015, when the first one was held at the Times Center in New York. (The nascent CoinDesk events team got 500 people to attend and managed to sign Citibank as title sponsor, quite a coup at a time when cryptocurrencies were still a mostly fringe topic.)  Since then, and including the past three years in which I’ve been the host of Consensus, the annual gathering has functioned as an all-inclusive bellwether for the state of the industry. The chaotic, jam-packed Consensus of 2018, for example, captured the frenetic bull market of the initial coin offering (ICO) era while the following year was more subdued, reflecting a bear market in which the focus turned to developers work on non-fungible tokens (NFT), layer 2 blockchains and decentralized finance (DeFi) prototypes that would later drive the next bull market 18 months later.  Looking back on all of them, I would say that no Consensus has felt as weighty as the one we will kick off next Wednesday at the Austin (Texas) Convention Center.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  As with 2019, trading losses, along with slimmed-down marketing and travel budgets, will ensure a somewhat smaller turnout than last year, which drew a record 20,000 attendees from more than 130 countries. (This year’s final tally won’t be known for a few days, but we know Consensus 2023 will still register as the second-largest in-person turnout in the conference’s history.)  What makes this one so important is not attendance per se, it’s the topics that will be discussed. Right now, there’s a confluence of seemingly disjointed forces that, combined, put crypto – with all its ups, downs, weighty issues and silly sideshows – into an important place in the global discourse around the future of money and digital citizenship.  Sure, the FTX debacle and crypto winter have soured mainstream opinion around this industry and, it seems, contributed to another major talking point of this conference: the U.S. “war on crypto.” But alongside that unprecedented regulatory crackdown, there’s also the background promise and anxiety stoked by the rapid encroachment of artificial intelligence into the broader digital economy.  Meanwhile, there’s the quiet but progressive engagement of traditional finance (TradFi) with digital asset technology – come hear Franklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson talk about what her 74-year-old firm is doing with music royalties – and that, whether we like it or not, governments continue to build central bank digital currencies (which is creating some strange bedfellows between conservative and progressive opponents of them.)  A lot rides on what happens in the policy and technical development front over the next few months and years. So, it’s important that such a wide array of people will gather in Austin to discuss such matters – developers from all the biggest protocols, regulators and politicians from inside and outside the U.S., academics, investment professionals, retail investors, venture capitalists, institutional investors, creators, marketing professionals and everyone in between.  This year, we’re taking advantage of the Consensus audience’s cross-sectional representation to bring stakeholders from different perspectives together to hash out their differences and try to collectively resolve some of crypto’s thorniest challenges, the results of which will be part of our inaugural Consensus @ Consensus report.  But while I’m excited for the in-depth, forward-looking conversations in those workshops and, more publicly, on eight different stages, programming this event has brought home the challenges in dealing with a technology that fosters such a wide range of opinions and emotions. People from a number of government agencies, financial institutions and mainstream consulting firms withdrew their previously agreed-upon speaking assignments in response to pressure from their internal public relations officers. This reluctance, it seems, reflects concerns about the image associated with this technology. (Note: A certain chairman of a certain securities regulatory commission turned down his third invitation in three years to speak at Consensus.)  What bothers me about this is that if one side of the debate is absent, they cede ground to the extremists on the other side. Not turning up is the best way for those who want a more regulated industry to allow the “crypto bros” to dominate the conversation. A more intensified echo chamber is hardly what we need. Now is the time for people to come together and address their differences, to advance the global conversation around this technology. It’s not the time to hide under a rock.  The good news is that, thanks to the engagement from regulators and businesses in non-U.S. jurisdictions, Consensus 2023 definitely will not feel like an echo chamber. In a number of sessions we’ll be highlighting the regulatory approaches and industry developments in Japan, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, the U.K. Bermuda, the Bahamas, South Korea, Switzerland and other countries, as well as from the International Monetary Fund. The outside world is engaging with crypto, even if the U.S. government establishment is showing it the hand. (As an aside, while we’re delighted to welcome back Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Rep. Patrick McHenry to the stage, it would have been nice to balance them with Democrats.)  At this pivotal moment, when regulation could drive innovation around one of the most important technologies of the century either into the shadows or toward people, companies and governments who can harness it and engineer systemic change, it is important that people are free to speak their mind. We need open, reasoned debate, not shrill fearmongering or demonizing. That’s what we plan to do in Austin. I hope to see you there.",NEUTRAL,없음,MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Michael J.

11988239,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=527977,1682101663,Is The Final Shakeout Moment Coming For Bitcoin? Expert Weighs In,"In January of this year, Bitcoin broke above its 200-day MA for the first time since the end of 2021. This was a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency, as it had not seen such a signal in over a year. This breakout was a clear indication of Bitcoin’s bullish momentum and its potential for further growth in the future. Additionally, Bitcoin retested the 200-day moving average in March and remained well above it, demonstrating its robust behavior. However, the leading cryptocurrency is approaching a lower-level retest at $28,000. Whether Bitcoin will withstand further price decline and continue its bullish trend or if a final shakeout is imminent. Bitcoin’s Halving Cycle And Potential Dip Below The 200-Day MA Recently, there has been speculation that Bitcoin’s price might be poised for a significant rally as spring arrives. However, the situation is not quite simple as with many things in the crypto world. According to the expert in the cryptocurrency industry, Mr. Ben Lily, the current halving cycle is an important factor to consider when evaluating Bitcoin’s price movements. When BTC comes off halving cycle lows, it commonly does not immediately clear the 200-day moving average (MA) and stays above it. Instead, it tends to return below the 200-day MA before ultimately moving on to form all-time highs. This pattern can be observed in the chart below, which shows the 200-day MA (represented by the dark red line) and the orange circles, which indicate when the price dipped below the 200-day MA. Furthermore, Lily argues that nothing suggests that the market should expect anything different this time. He believes a catalyst coming this summer will coincide with Bitcoin’s price dipping below the 200-day MA. FedNow Rollout And Bitcoin: A Tale Of Two Timing Additionally, Ben Lily has provided further analysis on the potential impact of the upcoming rollout of the Federal Reserve’s CBDC, FedNow, on Bitcoin’s price movements. According to Lily, if the rollout occurs as scheduled in July, it could benefit BTC’s price trajectory. However, Lily notes that in each of the last three halving cycles, Bitcoin’s price dipped below the 200-day moving average (MA) between 217 and 315 days before the halving itself. If this pattern holds for the current halving cycle, we can expect BTC’s price to dip below the 200-day MA sometime between June and August. With FedNow set to roll out in the middle of that period, Lily suggests we can expect regulator “war drumming” to be at a fever pitch. This could lead to a final shakeout moment as Bitcoin drops below the 200-day MA, creating a higher low in the market. At the moment of writing, Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is being traded at $28,000, indicating a decrease of over 2.5% in the last 24 hours. And, as reported yesterday by NewsBTC, the $27,700 line is key for Bitcoin, as a breakout below this level could signal a shift in the market sentiment and potentially lead to a further decline in price.

42420754,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqjAz,1682100843,"CoinDesk Had a 'Stash' of Bitcoin, and Other Stories Told by Consensus OG Joon Ian Wong","For years now, I’ve been saying that CoinDesk is one of the few companies in the crypto industry that deserves to have a book written about them. If you know anything of its 10-year history, the publication that’s sometimes called “Crypto's Paper of Record” has seen a host of complicated characters filter in and out, and has a narrative arc that would make director James Cameron blush. Founded by a London-based multi-millionaire and later bought by a New York-based billionaire (though it's complicated), CoinDesk has survived periods of severe penury as well as the excesses of multiple crypto bull markets – all the while publishing daily a staid accounting of the blossoming crypto industry (and biting commentary), including one of the most impactful financial news stories ever written.  Joon Ian Wong will be speaking next week at Consensus 2023 in Austin, Texas. Register here.  Joon Ian Wong, a journalist turned consultant and conference organizer with Cryptographic Media and Amplified Event Strategy, two startups he founded in the midst of the coronavirus panic, was at CoinDesk basically from the beginning. He covered the scene back when “the crypto market” was composed of only bitcoin and its various hard forks, before Ethereum had launched. He wrote profiles of, and sourced information from, the luminaries of the time, people who now would be nearly impossible to get on the phone, including BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes and Coinbase chief executive Brian Armstrong (see below).  Most importantly, however, Wong helped create Consensus – the flagship conference for CoinDesk, which has developed into something of a “Big Tent” event where all parts of the crypto industry can meet. Forgive me if this article seems a little salesy or self-indulgent (media people might also call it “inside baseball""), but there is value in hearing from people who have seen an industry mature and helped found some of its long-lasting traditions. Wong has insights for anyone looking to break into the lucrative crypto events business – and if that requires that we break the fourth wall by speaking to a former colleague, then so be it.  See also: Joon Ian Wong – Web 3 and the Rise of Small Media | Opinion  Wong discussed the founding of the historic conference, ahead of Consensus 2023 in Austin, Texas. We spoke about his early beat, and the people he met back then who have surprised him the most today. (This isn’t the only time CoinDesk will go meta at Consensus, which marks our tenth anniversary – we’re also putting together a package of stories called ""CoinDesk Turns 10,"" looking at the biggest stories of each year of its existence and why they still matter, and ""Consensus @ Consensus,"" a report digging into the agreed upon solutions that may emerge at the conference.)  The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.  So CoinDesk is doing this series called CoinDesk at 10 to celebrate its decade in existence. I was hoping we might get an oral history of Consensus, as you remember it, as one of the creators of the conference. Why did you guys think it was a good idea at the time to run a conference? [Editor's note:  At the time, CoinDesk was running out of money, and we needed a slug of cash. I think we sold our stash of bitcoin; I forget how many, maybe 10 bitcoin at $300 a pop.  CoinDesk had a stash of bitcoin?  Yeah, one of the investors had invested using bitcoin. I think it was Barry [Silbert, founder of Digital Currency Group – CoinDesk’s current owner] actually. One second, my audio is refusing to connect.  ...  [S]o we needed some cash. A conference was the best way to do it. I had built a successful conference before in Singapore – a tech startup conference, one of the biggest in the region. And so I kind of reluctantly raised my hand and said, you know, we should do a conference. And away we went. But you know, the pressures are tremendous. I mean, it was existential. If it didn't work out, there would be no money, right? The whole company would shut down.  Did you guys have something to model it on, or a way to know how much revenue it would bring in?  At the time, the main conference for the industry was an annual thing organized by the Bitcoin Foundation. I thought it was very partisan – for true believers. A publication like CoinDesk had an opportunity to do something that was, you know, more arm's length, more objective, more neutral, you might say, and investigate the industry a bit more. Consensus was always about bringing in people who would not necessarily be in a room together under ordinary circumstances. That first conference we had Bitcoin Core developers like Greg Maxwell and Mike Hearn. We also had a young developer named Vitalik Buterin, who was trying to build a new [blockchain] called Ethereum. And we had [former U.S. prosecutor] Katie Haun, who had investigated the Silk Road, the FBI, the IRS. So it was really a convening of people with an interest in the technology but who had never been asked to sit around the same table.  What were the vibes of conferences like back then – it was technically a bear market, no?  I only went to one at the time, something called Coin Summit in London, organized by an investor. I remember there were people from Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund – VCs, founders. It was essentially a Silicon Valley tech conference, as opposed to something ideological like the Bitcoin Foundation ones. The biggest conference back then was probably the big one in Amsterdam in 2014. That had a festival-ish feel to it crossed with a political rally. I’m saying this not as an attendee, but somebody who read coverage of it. Consensus aimed to be more about business, talking shop.  Correct me if I’m wrong, but CoinDesk then was still based in the UK. Why Manhattan?  I can't remember exactly why we chose New York … but we ended up picking it! Speaking as somebody in the conference business, events in the U.S. make more money. You can charge more, people expect to pay more for tickets. So that was probably the reason.  Speaking very generally, crypto has two long-standing identities – tech and finance, which are related at times. There’s the blockchain-for-apps side, and the crypto-for-money thing. Does the decision to choose New York say anything about the priorities of the industry at the time?  Yeah, the tech versus finance question is interesting. By 2015 bitcoin had dropped to $200, right, people were saying “this is over, we're moving on. This industry is dead.” The only activity left was coming from the blockchain-not-bitcoin people. These were major financial institutions and banks saying we can use this technology, but we don't need this bitcoin stuff – they were very keen to get away from the speculative aspects of bitcoin. A lot of people make fun of that disembodied blockchain stuff but, you know, in bear markets, that is one of the dominant narratives and it does keep interest and attention on the industry. So 2015 was one of those years. Blythe Masters, who had been an executive at JPMorgan, was getting into the space. Our main sponsor was Citi. PwC and Deloitte were issuing reports. It was things like that driving interest. I think this was before Ethereum even launched.  When would you say the lifestyle elements of crypto started filtering in?  The crypto lifestyle is basically the same as that of a “tech nomad,” but with money, right? Instead of being a broke freelance writer in Bali, you actually have [a load] of money and you fly business class and stay in nice hotels or at least nice Airbnbs. And you don't really care where you have dinner. I think, you know, there are people who live that lifestyle who go from country to country.  We are still playing at the edges of what [digital scarcity] really means.  How far down the rabbit hole are you?  I would say I’ve deeply adopted it.  Really?  In my work. Not really for me, personally.  This is a question that's been litigated too often, but how important is hands-on experience for understanding what’s going on?  In my own experiences as a working journalist covering the space, I would always try to use the technology – the products and features – before having conversations with people about them. I’d argue it's quite difficult to cover the space well, if everything's an abstraction. [Bloomberg columnist] Matt Levine is very good at understanding abstractions and commenting on them – he may not need to open a MetaMask wallet to understand what he’s reading. But for the vast majority of people covering crypto, it probably pays to use it.  Do you have a story you’re proud to have written?  Nor really, I think my reporting record with CoinDesk was largely undistinguished. I wrote one of the early profiles of Wall Street people who quit to join bitcoin – that was one of the narratives back then. A lot of those early stories were interesting snapshots of people in the very early stages of being who we know today.  Anyone who you’re completely surprised at how they turned out?  I did a profile of a young former trader named Arthur Hayes. You can Google around CoinDesk.com and see. I would message Arthur for, you know, comments on the bitcoin price. There were no market analysts back then you could ask for comments. There were traders and that was it. Arthur was just a guy with some professional Wall Street experience. There’s like this joke: Bitcoin went up a quarter and then quickly went down and I’d asked him why that happened. And he would always give some intelligent response. But I knew he was in Hong Kong, and I would always check the time and he’d reply to me at 6 a.m., 4 a.m. until 10 p.m. He would always respond immediately. It was always a mystery to me. But, you know, I guess he was very busy building the BitMEX [exchange]. It’s interesting looking back at those early sources and thinking about what they were like versus where they ended up today. You know, this person did this or that or they ended up in jail or they're a convicted felon. All of which can be true for one person.  This is fun. Give me another one.  I never would have thought Vitalik could have become quite the icon that he is today. Or that Katie Haun would be one of the most successful VCs of all time. Or even that Arthur Hayes would have this redemption narrative. For most people I think it would have been quite difficult to predict where they ended up today. Perhaps even Brian Armstrong. This is not directly CoinDesk related, but I interviewed him in 2014 when he came to London as part of this big Coinbase world tour. You have to remember Coinbase started out as a wallet, competing with the Blockchain Dot Info. There was no exchange business. I think it was the world tour when they pivoted to become a brokerage. We had the interview near the CoinDesk office in Fitzrovia in London, and then that evening there was this very long-running meetup called Coin Scrum, which has been running since 2013, at a bar in East London near where I live. It was a packed house. You know, Brian Armstrong is gonna come and talk to us (even back then Coinbase was one of the better-funded startups). So he gave his talk and I remember a band of people came into the bar led by Amir Taaki [who, at the time, was one of the most prominent Bitcoin Core developers] and started heckling him. You know, “you're centralized.” “You’re fiat.” There were three or four of these guys, who I think all lived in the same East London squat, shouting at him from the crowd. Even back then, he was very even-tempered. He was trying to respond to them point by point. But he kind of got drowned out. There’s this sort of endearing image of the space back then. I just don't think you'll ever see Brian Armstrong and Amir Taaki in the same room ever again. People like Gavin Wood or Vitalik, they would go to these meetups and bars and try to convince people that their thing – Ethereum, whatever – was this great, wonderful thing. You'd have a motley crew of people listening to them. And from those very unlikely beginnings, you have kind of these quote unquote corporate titans of the day.  See also: Crypto OG Amir Taaki Announces DeFi Platform 'DarkFi'  I guess that energy sort of shifted to conferences. What do you make of the phrase “it’s always crypto week somewhere?”  It's been largely true. Maybe not quite as true as in some of the more hectic days. In 2021 you had people spending marketing budgets. But there's a qualitative dimension to this: There are crypto weeks and there are crypto weeks. A lot of events lack substance where, for example, the speakers are sponsors. Real – to use a term of art – Schelling points are a breed apart and become genuine gatherings of a community, ecosystem or industry. Denver is one of those. DevCon is probably one of those. Consensus is one for a very broad community. Or even early ones like the North American Bitcoin Conference where Vitalik discussed the Ethereum white paper on stage and was mobbed by investors as he got off. The tradition of genuine product launches and innovation happening and collaboration happening at conferences runs quite deep. But I don't think they should get mixed up with this idea of “crypto weeks,” which were invented by CoinDesk beginning with New York Blockchain Week, or purely promotional events that take place.  See also: Decentralized Media Via Web3: A Solution to Bias and News Reporting | Opinion  What’s the role of marketing at these things, or in the industry in general – like, how much of crypto culture is genuinely bottom up?  It’s kind of recursive. To follow in the footsteps of George Soros, I think people often start with a narrative and then need the market or reality to respond in that way for it to actually gain traction. You might claim something as a narrative, but that doesn't mean it's gonna take hold. It is more likely to take hold if it is actually true. So if you say like, Ethereum is this revolutionary thing and all these developers are really interested in it – at some point you actually need those developers to actually show up and start building stuff. That's the recursive part of it. Lots of people try and do it but the best conferences are ones that do not just reflect existing sentiment but intensify it. Take the first Consensus. There was genuinely a lot of interest in crypto from various corporate financial parties, and the conference helped to intensify that feeling. It brought together all these people and put them in a room and let them talk to each other in a way that otherwise would not necessarily have been possible. That’s essentially the role of conferences and crypto media.  I tend to excuse the worst aspects of crypto by saying “it’s future-forward.” We’ve seen a lot of pushback on the idea recently – with people asking, it’s been 13 years, what does the industry have to show for it? Do you think we even know what crypto is for yet?  I mean, it's a cliche, but we're still early. If you think about [artificial intelligence], for example, you might claim you can trace its lineage back to cybernetics in the 1950s and only today do we have decent chatbots. I still think digital scarcity is the main innovation of crypto, and we are still playing at the edges of what that really means, particularly as digital material, you know, digital stuff, proliferates exponentially. This is kind of the counterweight to the original thought of the internet as this utopian place of abundance. You can copy everything. It's boundless. There’s just more and more and more stuff. We're only now discovering that, you know, all this stuff isn't great – like, there's a lot of downsides and more and more stuff. Crypto is a counterweight to that big overarching trend that's been happening since the commercialization of the internet in the 1990s. It adds a little friction.  That’s a beautiful way of putting it.  See also: 'We Blew It.'

42420746,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqj2j,1682094464,What Taylor Swift Can Teach You About Investing,"Angry victims of the FTX swindle are looking for restitution from the celebrity spokespeople who pitched the failed exchange, in a lawsuit that names Larry David, Tom Brady and Shaquille O’Neill, among others. One name not on that list is Taylor Swift, who was offered a reported $100 million sponsorship deal with the offshore crypto exchange – but dodged embarrassment and potential legal fallout by exercising some basic skepticism.  Swift reportedly asked FTX representatives, “Can you tell me that these [listed assets] are not unregistered securities?” in the course of negotiations, which ultimately failed. That’s according to Adam Moskowitz, the plaintiff’s lawyer in the FTX endorsements suit, speaking to The Block’s Frank Chaparro. Moskowitz describes learning about the incident in the discovery phase of the suit, and I haven’t seen confirmation from Taylor Swift’s camp.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  But even if it’s a bit of a just-so story, there’s a wealth of wisdom in this little parable. It wouldn’t be the first time Swift showed herself to be a brilliant and sharp-elbowed businesswoman on top of her musical talent – for instance, having muscled her way free of an onerous publishing deal.  The lesson of her FTX adventure, though, is a bit more abstract than it seems. Swift’s question about unregistered securities was remarkably prescient, given that we’re now seeing aggressive regulatory crackdowns on crypto exchanges. She has, it seems, been paying attention. But selling unregistered securities was not what brought FTX down – old-fashioned fraud was the culprit. Swift did not, it seems, ask FTX representatives “is your management team secretly sending user assets to an affiliated hedge fund?”  How, then, might her securities law question, largely unrelated to the risk that ultimately manifested, have led Swift to shy away from going into business with FTX? I’m speculating here, but one likely scenario is that she or her people weren’t satisfied with the way FTX handled this and other questions. For instance, maybe Bankman-Fried or his representatives were confused or uncoordinated or defensive – all useful signs of an organization that may have deeper problems. (Or maybe the Swift camp didn’t appreciate FTX’s boy wonder playing “League of Legends” during their meeting.)  Despite Moskowitz’s secondhand characterization, we can’t be sure this is how it actually went down. The negotiations between FTX and Swift were first reported back in December by the Financial Times. The deal would have netted Swift $100 million for placing FTX branding at concerts. According to the FT’s sources, though, there was skepticism of the deal within FTX because of its astronomical price tag (for comparison, FTX paid $135 million for naming rights to the Miami Heat stadium).  But taken at face value, the lesson of Moskowitz’s story is that maybe you don’t have to be completely up to speed on every single long-tail risk facing everything you invest in. What Swift did right wasn’t so much asking a specific question about the law or securities – it was asking any challenging and critical questions at all.  See also: Will Taylor Swift Ever Issue a Music NFT? | Opinion  A truly canny investor won’t be entirely focused on the content of the answers to hard questions, but also on the way a question is addressed. Whether you’re able to do it face-to-face as Swift reportedly did or by turning a sharp eye to a company’s public communications, that’s a basic and crucial evaluation tool in business and investing at any level.  At least in my mind-palace version of events, Taylor Swift smelled a rat in the responses to her questions about securities law.

42420752,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqj7t,1682093100,Traders Are Tired of Trump NFTs,"This week, former U.S. President Donald Trump tried to outdo his first bizarre foray into Web3, this time with a non-fungible token (NFT) collection with even more ridiculous art than the original. But it appears traders have grown tired of Trump’s digital trading cards, and volumes for both collections have plummeted on the secondary market. (Sad.)  Meanwhile, auction house Sotheby’s (BID) plans to sell a collection of high-value NFTs seized by liquidators of bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, putting rare CryptoPunks and Chromie Squiggles up for auction for the first time since the asset portfolio was compiled in 2021.  You’re reading The Airdrop, our weekly newsletter where we discuss the biggest stories across Web3. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Friday.  This Week's Alpha  Trump NFTs, take two: In case you missed out on the first round of outlandish NFTs featuring the former president in various costumes and poses, Trump’s digital trading cards are back for a second series. Although both collections sold out within a day of launch, the first series had greater success in terms of secondary sales. At the time of writing, Trump’s second collection had a floor price on OpenSea of 0.049 ETH – or about $97, which is less than its mint price of $99. Currently, the best offer for a non-fungible token in the collection is 0.0469 ether (ETH), or about $91, highlighting its shrinking perceived value among buyers.  Sales slump: According to data from OpenSea, the project’s trading volume began to slide the day after mint, and it has continued to flatline.  First series flump: Data also indicates that interest in the first collection has diminished among collectors, with its floor price dramatically dropping and losing about half its value after the second collection’s release.  No love for even rare Trumps: Even the rare 1/1s in the new collection aren’t attracting high bids. The highest sale for a Series 2 NFT to date was for 4.69 ETH (roughly $9,000) and features Trump as a wrestling champ. Contrast that with the 37 ETH sale (which was about $43,000 at the time of sale) of this tuxedoed Trump 1/1 from the first drop.  Bulls-eye for Three Arrows’ liquidators: Teneo, the firm tasked with liquidating bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, is teaming up with Sotheby’s to sell an impressive collection of seized NFTs worth millions of dollars. The auction house said the Grails collection includes ""some of the most significant digital artworks ever assembled,” including rare pieces from Dmitri Cherniak’s “Ringers,” Snowfro’s “Chromie Squiggle,” Tyler Hobbs’ “Fidenza,” CryptoPunks and more. The first sales from the collection will take place during Sotheby’s marquee sale week this May in New York.  Right on target: Three Arrows Capital filed for bankruptcy protection in July and reportedly estimated its assets at around $1 billion, including NFTs worth about $22 million. The auction of these high-value digital assets will help Teneo quickly recoup some losses.  Developers stay hot during crypto winter: According to data from Web3 developer back-end company Alchemy, Ethereum developers have continued to build decentralized applications despite frigid crypto conditions. About nine times more Ethereum wallet software developer kits have been deployed since the first quarter of last year – an all-time high for installing wallet infrastructure.  NFT trading was up 126% since the fourth quarter of 2022.  Developers across the Polygon, Arbitrum and Optimism blockchains deployed 160% more smart contracts year over year.  Projects on the Rise  Our Force 1  Who: Nike (NKE) via .Swoosh  What: Following in the footsteps of competitor Adidas, global sportswear brand Nike will soon release its first NFT collection through its recently launched .Swoosh platform.  The virtual sneaker, called Our Force 1, or OF1, is a play on the brand's iconic Air Force 1 design. Collectors will have a choice of two digital boxes – the ""Classic Remix"" and the ""New Wave"" box – with each box type corresponding to different possible designs, including a design co-created by four Nike fans in January.  Each box is priced at $19.82, a tribute to the year the Air Force 1 sneaker was first released. Holders of the OF1 boxes will be able to open them at a later date.  How: To start, Nike began airdropping ""posters"" to random .Swoosh users, granting them early access to the NFT sale taking place on May 8. On May 10, the entire .Swoosh community will be able to purchase the digital goods through its marketplace.

According to the WhaleStats report, a top ETH whale picked up $3.22 million worth of SHIB tokens over the past 24 hours. The Ethereum whale performed the purchase in two transactions, scooping over 311 billion Siba Inu tokens within minutes. Shiba Inu’s Price Correction Attracts Top ETH Whales Shiba Inu has been on the list of preferred assets among top Ethereum whales over the past few months. The whales actively packed large chunks of SHIB tokens between January and February. However, it appears the whales went on break, waiting for another opportunity to strike. Related Reading: Cardano In Strong Demand Zone, Breaking Through Key Level Crucial A recent alert from the crypto tracking platform, WhaleStats, shows the 254th-biggest Ethereum whale purchased 311,998,734,794 SHIB tokens on April 20. The whale performed the transaction in two consecutive transactions. The whale bought 194,114,774,578 Shiba Inu tokens worth $2,069,263 before initiating another transaction for 117,883,216 SHIB worth $1,256,643. The unexpected token accumulation comes as Shiba Inu’s price fell from its critical support level at $0.0000107. Shiba Inu Price Outlook Amid Burn Rate Spikes The recent price decline comes after several days of massive SHIB token burn by the Shiba Inu community to boost the meme coin’s price. In the days following the Shibarium PuppyNet launch, large chunks of Shiba Inu coins went into the dead wallets. On April 20, the Shiba Inu token burn rate spiked by 3,500%, according to the burn tracking website, Shibburn. Following Shibburn’s hourly update, April 20 saw another 5,180% burn rate spike. Related Reading: Cardano Racks Up Nearly 4% Gain Amid Short-Term Losses – Will Investors Hold Firm? Given Shiba Inu’s massive circulation supply of tokens, the recent burn had little effect on the meme coin’s price. The token traded bearishly yesterday, with a 7.0% price decline, and has continued in the downtrend today. SHIB is slightly recovering after forming three consecutive red candles on the daily chart. The bears have dominated the market, pushing SHIB close to its support zone. Shiba Inu has dropped below its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), a bearish sentiment for the short and long term. Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 41.22, close to the oversold region of 30. The indicator is moving downwards, suggesting further decline for the asset. SHIB’s support levels are $0.0000085 and $0.0000102, with resistance levels at $0.0000115 and $0.0000112. SHIB is close to the $0.0000102 support level. If the level does not hold, expect further price decline from the asset in the coming days. At press time, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00001061, and the price is rising after declining by 3.6%.

42420768,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqmAn,1682092801,Solana’s Annual Carbon Footprint Equals 18062 Flights From London to New York,"The Solana Foundation released an emissions dashboard Friday to track the carbon footprint created by the thousands of computer servers that power the Solana blockchain.  Solana’s servers emitted 10,651 metric tons of carbon dioxide in the 12 months prior to April 1, 2023, according to the dashboard built by footprint calculator Carbonara. That’s roughly equivalent to eight flights from London to New York, based on CoinDesk estimates derived from data showing that route would produce about 1,300 lbs of carbon.  Pressure is growing for the crypto industry to take more accountability on blockchain-related emissions’ contributions to the climate crisis. The Bitcoin blockchain especially has come under wide criticism among environmental advocates for the amount of energy needed to mine the cryptocurrency, and the Ethereum blockchain’s transition to a proof-of-stake network was partly motivated by the desire for a more energy-efficient system.  Decentralized blockchains rely on massive networks of servers spread around the world; keeping them running requires plenty of electricity, and thus emits plenty of carbon.  Read more: Crypto Carbon: Can Blockchain Networks Fix Carbon Offsets?  While most environmental critics’ crypto ire is focused on Bitcoin – its proof-of-work mining system is by far the most energy intensive process among the major blockchains – smaller networks like Solana are still committing to transparency reports that shed light on consumption.  Solana’s topline footprint is an estimate based on where the network’s validators (who handle transaction processing) and RPC nodes (who feed data into the blockchain) are in the world, Austin Federa, the Solana Foundation’s head of strategy, told CoinDesk. He said the dashboard models the local electrical grids.  “We're probably overestimating because data centers often have offset programs that we're not accounting for,” he said in a text message.  Future iterations of the dashboard could provide emissions data down to the wallet so that users of the blockchain can track their individual footprints, a blog post said.

42420770,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqmBp,1682090223,"With MiCA Past the Finish Line, UK's Crypto Industry Calls for Rules of Its Own","The European Union finalized its wide-ranging markets in crypto assets (MiCA) legislation on Thursday, making it one of the first major jurisdictions to clarify its approach on supervising the sector. With the EU’s 27 nations now set to comply with the new regulation, other jurisdictions such as the U.K. – whose split from the bloc went down in history as the infamous “Brexit” – may feel some pressure to speed up implementing their own crypto rules, according to industry groups.  “While not flawless, MiCA is an extremely relevant regulatory stack that puts significant pressure on the U.K. and U.S. in terms of delivering operational clarity for crypto,” London-based lobby group CryptoUK said in a tweet on Thursday.  The EU’s bespoke MiCA package – which sets out authorization requirements for crypto service providers and token issuers to be enforced by member states – differs from the U.K.’s staged approach, with different regulators setting out their own requirements.  The U.K.’s post-Brexit economic strategy is laid out in the Financial Services and Markets Bill going through Parliament, and it contains provisions to regulate crypto as financial instruments and stablecoins as payments. A consultation on potential regulations for the sector, published in February, proposes broad consumer protection rules.  On Monday, with the MiCA vote imminent, U.K. Treasury Economic Secretary Andrew Griffith told CNBC that the government hopes to set out specific legislation for crypto in the next 12 months.  However, the U.K. is already behind the EU in setting rules for the crypto sector. Industry lobby groups say this could weigh heavily on U.K. policy makers.  “With the adoption of MiCA, the EU has solidified its position as a regulatory leader for years to come,” CryptoUK said.  Meanwhile, the U.K. has looked to MiCA for inspiration.  “There are aspects of [MiCA] which are interesting and I think everybody likes so we have factored that in our paper,” Gwyneth Nurse, director general of financial services at the Treasury, said at Innovate Finance’s annual Global Summit in April, referring to the U.K. consultation on crypto rules.  The U.K.’s consultation said policymakers were considering an authorization regime similar to that of MiCA. While the EU also made significant room for rulemaking around asset-backed stablecoins, the U.K. is attempting to regulate them as payments. Diverging from MiCA, the U.K.’s crypto proposals leave out areas such as settlement and financial advice.  The EU’s advantage over the U.K. when it comes to crypto regulations may just boil down to the fact that the former has managed to finalize its approach and offer clarity. The U.K.’s approach comes with a period of “uncertainty,” because rules have yet to come out, said Rhiannon Butterfield, policy adviser on payments and innovation at London-based lobby group U.K. Finance, in an emailed statement.  However, many crypto firms she has spoken with value the U.K’s staged approach because it builds on existing financial regulation, Butterfield said.  The U.K.’s strategy enables it to adapt more easily to crypto as things change, Nurse said at the Innovate Finance conference.  While the EU may still need to draft a followup legislative package dubbed “MiCA 2.0,"" the U.K. will just bring out the relevant regulation at the right time, Riccardo Tordera Ricchi, head of policy and government relations at the London-based Payments Association, said.  It's unlikely the U.K. will try to speed up its efforts to regulate the crypto sector now, Ricchi said.

Zilliqa secured first place among top-gaining coins in the bearish cryptocurrency market with a 9% uptrend over the past 24 hours. This price move follows a network performance statistics update shared by a Twitter community member @inna_everstake. According to stats, Zilliqa reached a new milestone in network addresses and daily transactions. Zilliqa Hits Milestone In Network Activity Zilliqa is a permissionless public blockchain that offers high transaction throughput. It aims to improve blockchain scalability and speed using sharding as a layer2 scaling solution. The Zilliqa network relies on shards to solve scalability issues. Each shard processes transactions independently. The number of transactions increases as the Zilliqa network grows and the number of shards increases. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Momentum Screeches To A Halt: What’s The Outlook? The recent network performance statistics suggest the Zilliqa network is rapidly growing and has gained more traction. According to the update, Zilliqa recorded 4,582,116 addresses with 47,937,935 transactions and over 5.5 billion staked ZIL tokens. The statistics are incredible, given Zilliqa’s position in the cryptocurrency market compared to other Smart Contract platforms like Cardano, Ethereum, and Solana. Another notable fact is that the total addresses recorded participate in active daily transactions. Zilliqa’s improved performance could be due to the increasing number of new developers coming to build on the network. The Zilliqa ecosystem has been active in running innovative programs that attract new Web3 developers, which is why the network addresses and transactions skyrocketed. ZIL Price Outlook Amid The Boost In Network Performance Zilliqa is among the coins with the most dynamic price movement this year. Zilliqa opened in 2023 at $0.01585 but gradually rallied to its current price of $0.0331, a notable increase amid slight pullbacks. Although ZIL is still 87.33% down from its all-time high price of $0.2563, recorded on May 6, 2021, it has improved considerably since 2020. ZIL’s price is over 1,210% higher than its all-time low of $0.002477 on March 13, 2020. At press time, ZIL is trading at $0.331, a 9% price increase from the April 20 closing price of $0.03015. Related Reading: OKB Tallies 24% Increase But Active Addresses Fail To Keep Pace – Here’s Why Even ZIL’s trading volume has increased by over 38% from $116.69 million on April 20 to $190.71 million today, April 21. That could be a further confirmation of increased network activity. ZIL also recorded a nearly 11% price gain over the past seven days when coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum gave up theirs. The token now has over 12% price increase in the last two weeks. From the technical perspective, ZIL’s market sentiment is bullish, with the oscillators and moving averages flagging a strong buy signal.

Trading 1.8% lower as of shortly before 10:30 a.m. ET, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) was priced at $28.19K, sitting just above a key support level of $28K -- the summer 2021 low. ""From a technical analysis perspective this is a pivotal moment for Bitcoin,"" said Marcus Sotiriou, market analyst at digital asset broker GlobalBlock. ""If $28,000 fails to hold on the daily time frame, this would signal a deviation back into the range which it just broke out of (a 10-month consolidation)."" Sotiriou attributed the recent pullback in BTC -- down 7% in the past five sessions -- in part to the U.K.'s latest inflation data , which showed consumer prices in the country still remained stubbornly high. That might spur the Bank of England to hike interest rates even more, in a move that could bode poorly for the price of BTC. ""However, the UK real yield curve remains extremely low, which means that the current monetary policy might not induce sufficient tightening,"" he wrote in a note. ""We are already seeing stagnant demand as UK real GDP is still below Q4 2019, and unemployment increased to 3.8%.""

The first deposit is matched 300% up to £500, the second 100% up to £1,000, the third 100% up to £2,000, the fourth 50% up to £2,500, and the fifth and final deposit is matched 50% up to £3,500. This is a highly generous potential bonus but the wagering requirements are somewhat restrictive at 45 times the bonus amount. Fully acceptable terms, but a tad bit into the higher end of the scale. The games on offer are also impressive but less numerous than many competing casinos. The slots are numerous and include titles by all of the leading providers. However, the table games are less prominent and not given as much space in the catalog at many other casinos. Its live casino makes up for that slightly, as it includes a good number of games, including gameshows and immersive gaming experiences.

Payments at a Casino Not on GamStop Payments at a casino not on GamStop can vary depending on the individual casino. However, most reputable online casinos offer a range of payment methods, including credit cards, e-wallets, bank transfers, and prepaid cards. It’s important to note that some payment methods may not be available in certain countries or regions. When making a payment at a casino not with GamStop, it’s crucial to ensure that the website is secure and encrypted to protect your personal and financial information. Look for casinos that use industry-standard security measures, such as SSL encryption, to safeguard your data. It’s also important to check the deposit and withdrawal limits and processing times for each payment method. Some payment methods may have lower minimum or maximum limits than others, and processing times may vary depending on the payment provider and the casino’s policies. Overall, when choosing a casino not with GamStop, it’s important to consider the payment options available and ensure that they meet your needs and preferences. By doing so, you can enjoy a seamless and secure gaming experience without worrying about payment issues. Advantages of Playing at Non Gamstop Casino Sites UK players who choose to play at a non-Gamstop online casino have more control over their gambling experience, as the casinos are not limited by the same restrictions. Here are a couple of benefits that stem from playing at an online casino without Gamstop. Easier KYC Verification When it comes to making your payments at any online casino, there is often a couple of hoops to jump through, especially with Gamstop sites. You may find that non-Gamstop sites do not have the same verification requirements. They are often referred to as no-verification casinos, as the process is much quicker. In contrast, other sites may have a process that takes a couple of days. Less Brand Tax and More Bonus Rewards One of the biggest advantages of these offshore sites is that they often have fewer taxes to pay. While this is an advantage for the site itself, it also comes at an advantage for you as it means that they can expand and increase their range of bonuses and promotions while lowering the deposit requirements. Ideally Situated Many of these online casinos without Gamstop are still located in Europe. While they are non-Gamstop sites, they are still considered safe and accept UK players. They provide a wide range of perks to enhance the gaming experience. Disadvantages of Casinos Not on Gamstop A couple of drawbacks are tied to non-Gamstop online casinos, which also need to be taken into account. We take a look at some of the disadvantages these sites have to give you a clear view of the experience available on any casino site without Gamstop. Counselling on Your Own Dime When it comes to non-Gamstop sites, you don’t have the option of free counselling. This is something that isn’t always noticeable, but it can be a big help in cases where it’s needed. Most non-Gamstop sites don’t have counselling options. A Withdrawal Flow With most sites, you find set withdrawal limits that are quite strict. At non-Gamstop casino sites, you will notice a free flow in terms of withdrawals, enabling you to withdraw any amount you want at any moment. Not Always Telephone Support Some non gamstop casinos don’t offer telephone support. However, many of these casinos provide around-the-clock live support via chat, which can be just as efficient. If you prefer telephone support, it’s important to check whether this option is available before signing up with a particular casino brand.

Licensed sites incorporate the latest security measures like SSL data encryption to provide a secure betting experience.

The coin reaching a new 9-month high triggered euphoria in the market. However, it has begun to wear off as Bitcoin has now returned to $28,000 once more. The question now is where does BTC go from here? Does it continue its uptrend and is further downside more likely for the cryptocurrency? Analyst Shares Expectations For Bitcoin Speaking on where Bitcoin might go from here, analyst Micheal van de Poppe shared his forecasts. The analyst shared a BTC chart that showed unpredictable movement for the cryptocurrency at best, signaling that BTC had entered a region where forecasts are hard to come up with. Related Reading: Arbitrum Defies Bears As ARB Price Breaks Above $1.7 Resistance, But Can It Keep Up? He put the next crucial point for the digital asset at the $27,600 level. Given that Bitcoin had previously ranged support here before its run-up above $30,000, it becomes an important level. Van de Poppe explained that the rally could continue from here but it would need to be fast. “Could take liquidity beneath, but needs a fast recovery,” he explained. #Bitcoin is currently showing weakness. Broke back in the range, lost one of the crucial levels. Final crucial level is at $27,600. Could take liquidity beneath, but needs a fast recovery. If not, and no break of $28,800, then I suspect we'll see $26,200. pic.twitter.com/TuCaFq8eIk — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) April 21, 2023 On the flip side of this is the $28,800 resistance being mounted by the bears. At this point, the analyst explains that it becomes crucial to breach this level. In the event that bulls are unable to retake it, then he puts the price back in the $26,000 territory. BTC Enters A Perilous Position BTC is now at a point where it becomes very important for it to at least see some upside if it is to continue holding its value. This is because its decline to $28,000 has now put it firmly below its 20-day moving average. So while Bitcoin remains bullish for the long term, the short term has turned bearish very quickly. BTC falls to $28,000 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com Right now, there is support at $28,000 but there is no telling if this will hold as BTC is already below $28,100. The mounting resistance at $28,800 is also a deterrent right now for investors, who are choosing to keep their distance. Related Reading: Bears Drag Ethereum Below $2,100 Support As ETH Withdrawals Cross $2 Billion However, such a position also means that the possibility of the upside is just as high as that of the downside. For some, this retracement has presented a unique opportunity to get into the cryptocurrency at cheaper prices and could trigger an accumulation trend. As long as demand remains high, then $25,000 remains speculation for now. Bitcoin’s price is still suffering losses at the time of this writing. It is currently trading at $28,033 with a 2.70% decline in the last 24 hours. On the weekly chart, it is seeing 9.04% losses, but there has been a small uptick of 5.11% in its trading volume in the last day.

The non-fungible token (NFT) collection features original art from the late comic book artist Michael Turner and his frequent collaborator Peter Steigerwald, who are known for their work across Marvel and DC comics as well as teaming up to illustrate series for Turner’s Aspen Comics.  Mythos Studios owns a 50% stake in Aspen Comics, as well as the underlying intellectual property. The Ekos Collection centers around characters from series such as Fathom and the eponymous Ekos, Turner’s final project that was not released at the time he died.  Maisel has been a longtime fan of Turner’s work and began collecting it in 2003. Each NFT is built on the original line art of Michael Turner and adds color inspired by different elements, such as the Pop Art movement, black light posters or neon lights.  “We’ve worked so hard to create this Ekos Genesis Art Collection and we’re now extremely excited to give people a chance to own this Ekos-inspired 1-of-1 original hand-crafted digital art. This wouldn’t be possible without Web3,” said David Maisel in a press release shared with CoinDesk.  In 2021, a two-piece digital collection of Turner’s work that featured the original line art and published colored cover of the first issue of Fathom sold for $100,000, seen below:  On May 2 at 10 a.m. PT, the Ekos Genesis Art Collection will kick off a Dutch auction of 995 1/1 NFTs. The date holds special significance for Maisel, as it marks the 15th anniversary of the theatrical release of “Iron Man,” the movie that kicked off the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Dutch auction will last 88 minutes and bidding will start at 10 ether (ETH), then drop by 0.5 ETH every four minutes until the price hits 0.5 ETH. Finally, it will drop to 0.2 ETH for the final eight minutes of the auction, provided the collection has not already sold out.  Prior to the Dutch auction, interested buyers can place a deposit for the NFTs starting on April 24th at 10 a.m. PT. Anyone who deposits 10 ETH before May 1 can lock in a piece of Ekos Genesis Art.  The first 100 early deposits will also receive an Early Collector Bonus of an additional NFT, from a separate collection of “Ekos Genesis Art Portraits.” The collectors who qualify for one or more bonus NFTs will be able to select their specific pieces of art in an order that prioritizes the earliest deposits (so first to deposit gets first pick and so on). Finally, the top six collectors overall at the end of the auction period will be rewarded with one of six unique NFTs featuring art generated from the same Fathom cover art from the 2021 sale.",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | SPONSORED | TRADING,Toby Leah Bochan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/04/21/marvel-studios-founder-david-maisel-launches-ekos-genesis-art-collection,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/775cf26db0c9ef0c1029399cd7aecf97913a6cf8-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

11980932,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=527921,1682082020,"Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Spike, Bullish Sign?","On-chain data shows the Bitcoin exchange outflows have seen a significant spike during the past day, a sign that may be bullish for the price. Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Have Observed A Large Spike Today As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, a total of 2,138 BTC has been taken out of exchanges during the last day. The “exchange outflow” is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin that’s being withdrawn from the wallets of all centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric has an elevated value, it means the investors are transferring out a large number of coins from these platforms. Generally, holders withdraw their BTC from exchanges for holding onto them for extended periods in offsite wallets. Because of this reason, elevated values of this metric can be a sign of accumulation, and hence, can be bullish for the cryptocurrency’s price. On the other hand, the low values of the indicator imply there aren’t many withdrawals happening in the market right now. Such a trend can be either bearish or neutral for the asset, depending on how the “exchange inflow,” the counterpart indicator, is behaving at the moment. Holders usually deposit to exchanges for selling-related purposes, so when the exchange inflow has high values, it suggests the investors may be participating in a selloff of the asset. Naturally, this can have bearish consequences for the price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Supply Older Than 7 Years On The Move Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin exchange outflow, as well as in the inflow, over the last day: The value of the outflow seems to have been quite high in recent hours | Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin exchange outflow has registered a very sharp spike in the last few hours. In total, the investors have withdrawn 2,138 BTC (about $60.6 million at the current exchange rate) from exchanges with this spike. Since these large withdrawals have come while the price of the cryptocurrency has been in the lower $28,000 values (which are relatively low levels considering the price had been above $30,000 just a few days ago), it’s possible that these transfers out of exchanges are a sign of fresh buying taking place in the market. From the chart, it’s also visible that the exchange inflows have remained at low values at the same time, meaning that there aren’t any deposits happening to counteract these withdrawals. This may imply that there isn’t any additional appetite for selling at the current levels for now. Related Reading: Quant Explains Bitcoin Funding Rates Pattern That Precedes Uptrends This fresh unimpeded Bitcoin accumulation can be a positive sign for the market, as it means that there are at least some large investors in the sector who view the current prices as a discounted buying opportunity, and not as a sign of more decline to come.

In December, he was indicted with eight counts, including money laundering and securities fraud, and in February 12 more counts were added, including running an unlicensed money transmitting business. “We took our time and did a lot of due diligence on the business.

This has created a sort of Trojan Horse opportunity for a startup with a well-known pedigree to bring cash-like instruments to the cryptocurrency space, laying the groundwork for the company’s broader ambition to digitize the corporate bond market.  The startup is PV01, whose name is a piece of bond jargon, and it was co-founded by Max Boonen, who also helped get the giant crypto market maker B2C2 off the ground. Its first product: tokenized, on-chain versions of one-month U.S. Treasury bills. Those are among the safest assets in the world, so investors treat them as equivalent to plain-vanilla fiat cash. A tokenized version brings something crypto companies may be yearning for post-March.  “It’s a cash management product,” Boonen, who used to work as an interest-rates trader at Goldman Sachs in London, said in a recent interview. “It’s not our endgame but it’s in high demand.”  He continued: “We target either the crypto firms that find it difficult to move money back and forth [between the crypto space and conventional financial system] – which is most – and also people who have a lot of wealth in crypto who are simply unable or unwilling to bring it back into the fold of the traditional system And those are two pretty big segments.”  Read more: Blockchain Meets Bonds: How Crypto Can Solve Long-Standing Issues in Capital Markets  But PV01 dreams of getting corporations to issue bonds on a blockchain. This initial foray into Treasurys works as a proof of concept for that; rather than finding a bond issuer, PV01 will simply purchase and then tokenize fixed-income products issued by probably safest issuer in the world: the U.S. government. But companies are the longer-term target.  “This goes back two years ago. I thought we ought to have bonds on a blockchain like we have equity tokens,” Boonen said. B2C2 was the “second-largest player in lending after [CoinDesk sister company] Genesis, and it felt strange to me that private, bilateral deals drove it.”  And then last year’s credit crunch, fueled in part by the demise of hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, “was made more severe by the fact that no one knew who owned what debt and who owed what debt.” On-chain bonds could solve that.  PV01 isn’t the first firm to attempt tokenized securities or to try bringing U.S. government debt on-chain; earlier this week, blockchain-based lending protocol Maple Finance announced a cash-management product that also provides access to one-month Treasurys. Also this month, Ondo Finance announced a stablecoin backed by money-market funds, exploring similar turf.  Read more: Ondo Finance Plans Yield-Generating Stablecoin Alternative for Institutional Investors  Part of the allure of one-month U.S. bills is their yields have risen so much – to around 3.5% – because of the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes. “When rates were 0%, it was easy to do nothing. Stick it in stablecoins and wait,” Boonen said. PV01’s tokenized bills mean customers can have the benefit of those juicy rates while still technically keeping their money in crypto.  “If you want to buy T-Bills, you need fiat dollars,” he said. “But if you could just use stablecoins [to buy them] you remove one layer of the trade.”  PV01 is working with two unspecified brokers to secure the bills, which are then put in a special purpose vehicle (SPV).  Despite being U.S.-issued debt, PV01 won’t immediately operate in the U.S., where regulation and scrutiny of crypto is getting stricter. “We’re only going to offer our products broadly in the United States when we have a clear sense that it’s legal to do so based on the setup that we have put in place,” he said. “And if it’s never possible, then we never will.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING | ONDO,"Brandy Betz, Nick Baker",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/04/21/crypto-trading-legends-next-move-is-bringing-us-treasurys-to-crypto-with-plans-for-corporate-bonds-too,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fb7dfe2e082afd86487f319ea1b70e97992aade7-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin was down for a third straight day on Friday, falling 3% over the last 24 hours to about $28,000. The cryptocurrency has lost almost 10% since last Friday. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, has lost 8% during that period. This comes following a mostly down week for risky assets like cryptocurrencies. On Wednesday, $100 million in bitcoin positions was liquidated on Binance, but one possible positive development for crypto came on Thursday when the European Parliament passed comprehensive crypto legislation, becoming the first major jurisdiction to do so.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is advising brokers and investment advisers they need to look at crypto with more scrutiny before they recommend digital assets to ensure the risky products are in the best interests of their clients. A Thursday staff bulletin – outlining the duties the advisers have to customers – specifically mentioned crypto, continuing the agency’s recent focus on the sector after having largely ignored digital assets in its rules and guidance until last year.  Coinbase (COIN) has obtained a license to offer its services in Bermuda as it seeks to expand internationally, the company announced in a blog post on Wednesday. The U.S. crypto exchange received a Class F license from the Bermuda Monetary Authority, which allows the company to operate as a digital-asset exchange in that territory. The news comes two days after CEO Brian Armstrong indicated the U.S.-based exchange would consider moving out of the U.S. if clear crypto regulation isn't enacted.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the difference in the number of ether flowing into and out of the leading centralized exchange Binance in the past 48 hours.  More than 34,000 ETH ($64.8 million) were transferred to Binance early Friday, as represented by the green bars.  According to pseudonymous analyst @OnchainDataNerd, the large investor who moved these coins will earn a profit of $6 million if he chooses to liquidate his holdings.  Potential liquidation might add to bearish pressures on ether.

11979566,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=527922,1682078434,"Cardano (ADA) Outlook Looks Bullish Despite Recent Drop, Here’s Why","The crypto market-wide correction has also left its mark on the Cardano price. Nevertheless, ADA is holding up better than other altcoins. While Ethereum fell by 9.1% in the last seven days, Polygon (MATIC) by 11.1%, Cardano “only” fell by 7.6% in the same period. In addition to recent strong fundamentals, a bullish chart pattern for ADA in the 1-day chart is also likely to play an important role. In this time frame, Cardano has formed a massive reverse head-and-shoulders pattern since last October, which came to fruition just before crypto prices collapsed. The reversed head and shoulders price signals the end of a downtrend and is therefore a trend reversal formation. Ideally, the head and shoulders – as is currently the case with ADA – forms the conclusion of a long-term downtrend. It occurs after a pronounced downtrend with three lows. The middle low is the highest and is called the head. The surrounding highs are called shoulders. Investors usually enter a long position when the price rises above the neckline resistance, which can be considered a massively bullish sign. The current correction is bringing the ADA price back towards the neckline, although ADA had just broken out last week. Related Reading: Cardano In Strong Demand Zone, Breaking Through Key Level Crucial The move can therefore be seen as a bullish retest of the neckline. The level at $0.405 is the key price ADA bulls need to defend. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez pointed out the chart pattern lately and stated: The recent correction looks like a bullish retest before ADA reaches the target of this inverse head & shoulders formation. Still, the 200EMA on the daily chart at $0.39 must hold ADA for the bullish outlook to remain valid. Fundamental Outlook For Cardano Equally Bullish Ken Kodama, founder and CEO at Emurgo and co-founder of the Cardano project also shared a number of bullish reasons today that can be attributed to fundamentals. As Kodama explains, the Voltaire era and CIP-1694 are the biggest topics for Cardano right now. One point where Cardano stands out is developer activity. In 2023, Cardano is a frontrunner for developer activity on GitHub. In recent years, Cardano has been the most actively developed blockchain network, according to Santiment, and is consistently in the top 3 from month to month, according to Kodama. Related Reading: Cardano Racks Up Nearly 4% Gain Amid Short-Term Losses – Will Investors Hold Firm? The ADA co-founder also highlights the recent Dynamic P2P Nodes upgrade, which allows Cardano stake pools to be more decentralized and improve connectivity to other nodes. Voltaire and CIP-1694 will provide the foundation for community-driven on-chain governance of Cardano. Regarding stablecoins, Kodama states: Cardano native stablecoins are assets as they help with liquidity, allow for an on-chain safe haven, and a faster alternative to traditional payment processors. There are still questions about the use of stablecoins, but development continues and they are gaining traction. Cardano’s DeFi space is also making great progress, as NewsBTC shared recently. Cardano’s DeFi has reached TVL all-time highs in recent months. “DEXs, and other DeFi products continue to build and attract users, building the overall #CardanoDeFi ecosystem,” concluded the Emurgo founder. At press time, the ADA price was at $0.4023, fighting to accomplish a daily close above the neckline.

42420764,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqm3Z,1682076600,Unleashing the Green Economy: How Blockchain Can Transform Climate-Friendly Investment Opportunities,"In the face of mounting urgency to address climate change, the quest for innovative solutions to foster sustainable growth and resilience is more critical than ever. Coming from the realm of digital currencies, blockchain technology emerges as a trailblazing force, poised to drive a transformative shift within the green economy and catalyze climate-friendly investment and innovation across a multitude of sectors.  At its essence, blockchain operates as a decentralized digital ledger, meticulously recording transactions with unparalleled security and transparency across a vast network of computers. This revolutionary technology harbors the potential to redefine how governments, private companies, multinational corporations and communities adapt to and mitigate the multifaceted risks posed by climate change.  Osho Jha is the CEO and co-founder at dClimate, a decentralized network for climate data.  Though blockchain is a groundbreaking and invaluable tool, it represents just one element within a complex, interconnected web of solutions. Tackling climate change necessitates a unified, concerted effort from governments, businesses and individuals, each harnessing the power of diverse innovations, robust information-sharing networks and sustainable infrastructure.  Blockchain technology holds particular promise in the fight against climate change for three key reasons: it can amplify voluntary carbon markets to channel billions of dollars towards green investments, facilitate the widespread adoption of parametric insurance for climate events and accelerate development of open data infrastructure necessary to help coordinate global actors.  By unlocking the immense potential of blockchain, we stand at the precipice of a transformative era in the global movement towards a greener economy.  Open data infrastructure  A major challenge in addressing climate change is the lack of access to high-quality, reliable data. Accurate climate information is crucial for decision-makers – ranging from policymakers to investors – to make informed choices that promote sustainability. Blockchain technology can serve as the foundation for an open data infrastructure, enabling secure and transparent sharing of climate data.  Several decentralized climate information ecosystems have emerged to leverage blockchain technology, providing trusted, transparent platforms for sharing and monetizing climate data. By using smart contracts and token incentives, data providers can be rewarded fairly for their contributions while ensuring data integrity and accessibility.  An open data infrastructure would allow businesses to access reliable climate data, helping them identify new climate-friendly investment opportunities and assess risks associated with climate change.  Blockchain technology holds immense potential to drive sustainable growth and innovation across various industries amid an increasingly warming planet.  Corporations and institutions can leverage this open data infrastructure for transparent and accurate climate risk assessment and disclosure. Further, as regulatory bodies and investors demand better climate-related reporting and disclosures, companies can utilize blockchain-based platforms to demonstrate their commitment to sustainability and responsible risk management.  By providing a secure, transparent and accessible data ecosystem, blockchain technology can help bridge the information gap that has long hampered climate action, empowering businesses to effectively navigate the challenges and opportunities of a rapidly changing world.  Scaling the voluntary carbon market  The voluntary carbon market (VCM) has emerged as a critical mechanism for funding carbon reduction and removal projects. However, the current marketplaces have limitations including opaque pricing and verification processes, which has hindered the growth and potential impact of the overall industry. Blockchain technology can streamline and scale the carbon credit market by increasing transparency and efficiency, making it more attractive to businesses and investors.  Blockchain-powered platforms automate the tracking and management of carbon credits, reducing the risk of double counting and ensuring that credits are verifiable and unique. This increased transparency can lead to more accurate pricing and facilitate the flow of capital to projects with the highest impact, creating more climate-friendly investment opportunities.  Blockchain technology can also make buying and trading carbon offsets quicker and more transparent, eliminating the need for brokers and intermediaries. Moreover, smart contracts can directly connect buyers and sellers, reducing transaction costs and increasing market efficiency.  Tokenized carbon credits also facilitate monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) systems essential to keeping markets fair. Also, these tokens can be updated automatically when changes occur, ensuring their value accurately reflects the underlying carbon offset project's performance – which has proven challenging for the industry.  This level of transparency and automation is crucial for building trust among corporations and institutions in the carbon offset market as a viable tool for achieving sustainable investment goals. By leveraging blockchain technology, the voluntary carbon market can become a more efficient and reliable market, empowering businesses to take meaningful action against climate change and integrate carbon offsets into their broader ESG strategies.  Parametric insurance  The increased frequency and severity of climate-related events, such as floods and hurricanes, have exposed the limitations of traditional insurance models. Parametric insurance, which relies on predefined triggers based on measurable parameters to offer pre-specified payouts, are nontraditional but perhaps more efficient, transparent and scalable than other forms of insurance. Blockchain technology can play a pivotal role in the adoption and expansion of parametric insurance, benefiting both insurers and policyholders.  Similar to the case mentioned above, blockchain-based platforms can automate the processing and payment of parametric insurance claims using smart contracts, reducing the need for lengthy claims assessments and providing faster payouts to policyholders. By offering a transparent and secure system for managing and verifying data, blockchain technology enables the development of more accurate risk models and pricing, thereby promoting the widespread adoption of parametric insurance.  Decentralized oracle networks such as Chainlink play a vital role in this process by providing tamper-proof data streams to smart contracts, ensuring the agreed upon triggers for payouts used in parametric insurance are based on accurate and trustworthy information.  With access to accurate, real-time data, businesses can better understand their exposure to climate risks across their operations, balance sheets and supply chains. This may prove essential for corporations making informed decisions about their risk management strategies and climate plans.  Parametric insurance, built on a foundation of reliable real-world data secured by a decentralized oracle network, would therefore serve as a valuable tool for building financial resilience and mitigating the negative impacts of climate-related events. As a result, companies would be better placed to survive and thrive in an increasingly uncertain climate landscape.  Beyond blockchain  Blockchain technology holds immense potential to drive sustainable growth and innovation across various industries amid an increasingly warming planet. By providing a foundation for an open data infrastructure, streamlining the voluntary carbon market and supporting the expansion of parametric insurance, blockchain can be a transformative force in the transition to a green economy.

They're Being Ignored / Opinion  However, it is essential to recognize that blockchain is just one of many tools needed to accelerate climate action. Robust information sharing networks, green infrastructure and collaboration among stakeholders are also crucial for creating lasting change.  Embracing blockchain technology, along with a multitude of other innovative solutions, is vital in the search for effective ways to address the pressing issue of climate change.

Altcoins are any cryptocurrency other than bitcoin.  Data from TradingView show bitcoin's dominance rate rose to 48% from 42% during the first quarter and has struggled to surpass that level so far this month.  The metric has oscillated between 38% and 48% for almost two years, with declines from 46% to 48% coinciding with outsized gains in altcoins.  ""Bitcoin’s dominance could peak out, this would signal that altcoins would outperform,"" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto-services provider Matrixport, said in a note to clients on Thursday.  The chart shows that the total market cap of altcoins (white line, blue arrows) rose more than 60% to $1.39 trillion in the two months after the BTC dominance rate turned lower from 48% in July 2021. Similar bearish turnarounds in the dominance rate in mid-October 2021 and June 2022 also pushed altcoin valuations higher.  History could repeat itself, according to Thielen.  ""Bitcoin’s dominance appears to be peaking out at similar levels as in 2022 – accounting for 45/46% of the total crypto market capitalization,"" Thielen said. ""For bitcoin to continue outperforming the rest of the ecosystem would imply that only bitcoin matters, which appears to be unlikely considering the intellectual and financial firepower that is being deployed on other chains.

The overall market sentiment has been bearish, with many investors pulling out of the market in anticipation of further price drops. Fundamental Factors Behind OKB’s Bullish Momentum Meanwhile, OKB’s latest surge cannot be solely attributed to technical analysis, as fundamental factors played a significant role in its growth. Two key factors can be identified, the first being the announcement of the SUI blockchain and its integration with OKX. OKB holders will have the opportunity to purchase SUI tokens at a discounted rate, which has led to a significant increase in trading volume. The second factor driving OKB’s price is the upcoming launch of OKBChain, an L2 chain on Ethereum that will utilize ZK technology. The new chain will feature OKB as the token for gas fees, solidifying its role in the OKEx ecosystem. OKB/USD trading at $52.98 on the daily chart at TradingView.com Related Reading: Shiba Inu Gets Stuck In Price Range – Will SHIB Break Free? These fundamental developments have contributed to the resilience of OKB in the face of the current market downturn, and investors are closely watching to see how they will impact its future price trajectory. As the crypto market continues to evolve and adapt, it will be interesting to see where OKB’s price trajectory is headed. -Featured image from Blockchain News",POSITIVE,OKB | SUI,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | OKB | SUI,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/okb-rallies-22-today/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

42420774,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqmFx,1682072587,EU Crypto Industry Applauds MiCA – But Looks to What’s Next,"The European Parliament's landslide vote in favor of new crypto licensing rules was largely met with applause from the industry, but now attention turns to the details that need to be colored in.  A long-awaited and expected approval of the Markets in Crypto Assets regulation means the landmark law intended to protect consumers and ensure financial stability can take effect in mid-2024. The initial reaction has been warm.  Shortly after the vote, crypto exchange Coinbase tweeted that the vote is a “pivotal moment for crypto regulation,” because the law will “give crypto organizations the confidence to invest and grow in the region.”  The law, known as MiCA, requires exchanges and wallet providers to obtain a license and stablecoin issuers to hold appropriate reserves,  Antoni Trenchev, co-founder and managing partner at crypto lender Nexo, said the approval shows that the “crypto industry has finally had this affirmation,” adding in an emailed statement that “MiCA makes Europe fit for the digital age and will foster innovation and fair competition.” Last year, Nexo announced it would shutter its U.S. business, saying that talks with regulators there had reached a dead end.  Optimism about MiCA’s impact seems to be matched in the traditional-financial sector. “We perceive regulation as a net positive for the industry,” a report from Deutsche Bank (DB) staffers stated, citing the likely effects on corporate adoption, liquidity and volatility.  Crypto is “a dangerously unregulated sector,” research analysts Marion Laboure and Cassidy Ainsworth-Grace wrote in the report, and that has “exposed investors to massive losses across all crypto platforms.”  The key question now is how companies will prepare. John Ehlers, chief operating officer at crypto exchange Bitstamp, said that while the outlines of the law have been known for some time, there's a 12-18 month transition period that will start ticking in June or July, and getting ready will be a bigger task for some than others.  “For those that are new to this business, and coming into the European market, it is a step change in how they operate,” Ehler said on CoinDesk’s ""First Mover"" show on Thursday.  “If you’re new to this space, you’re not going to have very stringent AML (anti-money-laundering) requirements for account opening,” Ehlers said. “If you’ve already been regulated in the EU (European Union), you’re probably in pretty good shape.”  Long task  Even long-established players face a long road ahead. That includes Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by volume. It already holds a number of crypto registrations within the bloc, including under the relatively well-developed and MiCA-like regime in France.  “There are now clear rules of the game for crypto exchanges to operate in the EU,” Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao tweeted in response to the vote. “We’re ready to make adjustments to our business over the next 12-18 months to be in a position of full compliance.”  But, Zhao also said, “The fine details will matter.”  While the overarching MiCA law, known as a “level one” text, is now nailed down, EU agencies such as the European Securities and Markets Authority say they will have to draft and consult on the “substantial package of implementing measures” that lie underneath.  Crypto industry players will be watching closely.  “There are a lot of things that the MiCA level one text does not define – there are questions that will be answered in the so-called level two legislation,” Tommaso Astazi, head of regulatory affairs at lobby group Blockchain for Europe, said at an event in Brussels last month.  There were last-minute disputes among lawmakers and governments on how the law should treat NFTs and decentralized finance, and hastily drafted compromise language may not always be clear about, for example, what is or isn’t an non-fungible token or a decentralized grouping.  Policing  While the EU law sets a common standard, it will be enforced by individual national regulators in the bloc’s 27 member states, and some are concerned that countries could impose extra hurdles or in the other direction undercut each other in a bid to attract business.  Final details of the law should “ensure consistent MiCA implementation across member states, especially at the licensing stage, to ensure a level playing field and avoid regulatory arbitrage,” as well as making a smooth transition from existing national regimes, Mark Jennings, head of European operations at crypto exchange Kraken, wrote in an email sent ahead of the vote.  Those final steps could prove crucial to MiCA’s success, Jennings suggested.  “What once seemed a lofty legislative goal could soon become a universal standard for customer protection and business efficiency, if the EU can get the technical implementation of this framework right,” he said.

But unlike some of its peers, Shiba Inu seems to be stuck in a price range, leaving investors wondering if it’s the calm before the storm or the new normal. When a cryptocurrency, or any asset, is stuck in a price range, it means that it has been trading within a specific range of prices for an extended period of time, with little upward or downward movement. As the digital asset struggles to break free from its current slump, the question on everyone’s mind is: will Shiba Inu’s bark ever match its bite? Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Momentum Screeches To A Halt: What’s The Outlook? Shibarium Beta Progress A Ray Of Hope For Shiba Inu Shiba Inu’s dedication to growth and innovation is on full display with the recent public release of Shibarium beta’s documentation and continued project developments. However, while the platform is making strides forward, SHIB’s price remains stagnant, as the market remains hesitant and uncertain. Despite Shiba Inu’s best efforts to expand their ecosystem and improve its capabilities, its fortunes have taken a recent hit, with the cryptocurrency experiencing a 2.30% drop in just 24 hours and a 6.84% slump over the past week, as reported by CoinMarketCap. SHIB Burning Sees Mild Growth, Whale Trading Activity Down As the price of Shiba Inu takes a much-needed breather, the total number of SHIB tokens being burned has seen mild but consistent growth. Within the last 24 hours alone, over 5.2 million SHIB tokens were burned, indicating that the community is taking steps to regulate the token’s supply. Shiba Inu’s impressive performance hasn’t gone unnoticed either, as the cryptocurrency has been on a rampage for the better part of the week. The meme coin’s network activity reached a new high at the end of March, with nearly 36,000 SHIB addresses transacting on the network. #ShibaInu saw the largest spike in daily active $SHIB addresses over a year, with ~35,788 unique #SHIB addresses interacting on the network! pic.twitter.com/gNoH7UrYgf — Ali (@ali_charts) April 1, 2023 According to crypto-analyst Ali Martinez, citing Santiment data on Twitter, this was the highest daily surge in active addresses recorded in 2023, setting a record high for network activity since the beginning of the year. However, despite the launch of the highly anticipated Shibarium L2, whale trading activity has continued to decline. This suggests that the market’s largest players may be sitting on the sidelines for the time being, waiting for the right moment to make their move. As the price of SHIB remains stagnant, it remains to be seen how these developments will impact Shiba Inu’s overall trajectory in the long run.

As Shiba Inu navigates through a period of uncertainty, it’s worth examining what the future holds for the cryptocurrency. While the recent Shibarium L2 launch and increased network activity have been promising developments, whale trading activity has continued to decline. This could be an indication that the market’s largest players are adopting a wait-and-see approach, looking for more clarity and stability in the market before making any significant moves. -Featured image from Jake A Carlson",NEUTRAL,SHIB,BUSINESS | ICO | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/shiba-inu-stuck-in-price-range/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/11976290.jpeg

At press time, the AXS price was $8.22, down 12% for the week, CoinDesk data shows. The cryptocurrency had a total valuation of $941.7 million, the third largest in the play-to-earn and gaming sector, behind market leader Decentraland's MANA and The Sandbox's SAND.  Data from TokenUnlocks show on April 23 Axie will unlock 18.89 million tokens, worth $155.27 million at the current rate, amounting to 7% of the cryptocurrency's total supply of 270 million.  Axie kicked off a staggered 65-month token unlock in 2020, and so far 176.55 million tokens have been made available. The remaining 77.76 million will be unlocked by the end of 2025.  Unlocks are widely considered bearish catalysts. That's because holders benefiting from the unlock have the new ability to sell their coins, potentially adding to the supply in the market. It's common for early-stage projects to lock tokens to prevent big holders, typically early investors or project team members, from selling their coins all at once and causing a price slide.  Still, unlocks don't always lead to lower prices, and in the past AXS has rallied in the leadup to the unlocking event. Besides, the broader crypto market has faced selling pressure this week, with top cryptocurrencies bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) losing 8% and 10%, respectively. Most play-to-earn and gaming tokens are down between 5% and 10%.  In other words, AXS' decline, at least partly, seems to be driven by broader risk aversion.  Amid AXS' price drop, the dollar value locked in futures tied to the token has declined by nearly 20% to $44 million this week, according to data tracked by Coinglass.  A decline in both price and open interest suggests the fall has been caused mainly due to closures of bullish positions rather than outright shorts or bearish bets.",NEGATIVE,AXS | BTC | MANA,AXS | BTC | MANA | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/21/axs-nurses-losses-as-axie-infinitys-156m-token-unlock-looms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/31e6bd02df9f33f43938ed63bc83017362a6dde0-1727x968.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A large number of traders had recently opened bullish bets on a sustained rise in Bitcoin and Ethereum, an easy play for market makers to liquidate these positions through major sell-offs. According to Coinglass, liquidations of leveraged positions exceeded $262.5 million across the crypto market yesterday (Thursday). This is the highest level so far this year and shows that the greed in the market was too high. According to @coinglass_com data, yesterday saw the largest long liquidation event this year. pic.twitter.com/hzgx4fDeVJ — tedtalksmacro (@tedtalksmacro) April 20, 2023 Every dip was bought by traders with leverage in anticipation of a bounce to the range high. This unhealthy market behavior needs to be flushed out of the market to create a sustainable price rise (as before) through spot buying. Bitcoin And Crypto Continue To Be In The Danger Zone Technical analyst and founder of Eight Global, Michaël van de Poppe, believes Bitcoin is not out of the danger zone yet because the price is currently exhibiting weakness: Bitcoin is currently showing weakness. Broke back in the range, lost one of the crucial levels. Final crucial level is at $27,600. Could take liquidity below, but needs a fast recovery. If not, and no break of $28,800, then I suspect we’ll see $26,200. From an on-chain perspective, the price level at $28,300 might be crucial as Bitcoin’s Realized Price – UTXO Age Bands (1 week to 1 month) is located here. As analyst Crazzyblockk writes via CryptoQuant, the level can be considered as a psychological level for people looking for short-term gains. Related Reading: Bitcoin In Danger Zone: Bulls Must Hold $27,700 For Price Recovery, Expert Suggests The reaction to this area could be instrumental in judging the strength or even weakness of the bulls. “If Bitcoin receives a reaction from the short-term at these levels, it will be a sign of renewed interest in holding and entry by these people, and if this level breaks, these players will continue to sell,” the analyst predicts. Traders should also keep an eye on the US dollar index (DXY), as US dollar strength will be a headwind for the crypto space. As we reported in previous market updates, the DXY could initially gain strength in the coming weeks before writing new lows – as Glassnode’s co-founders expect.

Remarkably, according to Bloomberg, hedge funds are betting on a significant rise in the US dollar for the first time in over a year. At press time, the Bitcoin price was trading at $27,952, continuing the downward trend of the last two days.

Time and time again, with volatility in the underlying crypto markets, we see a migration of investors moving from more crypto native spot platforms to futures. With uncertain and volatile markets, the ability to borrow and go short spot crypto has dried up. As such, futures have become the venue in which institutions can efficiently gain short exposure. By Payal Shah At a glance Recent events have sparked a migration of investors moving from crypto-native platforms to futures. A regulated futures marketplace provides continuity of risk transfer and price discovery for the crypto industry. The digital asset market skyrocketed in value and influence in late 2021. 2022 was, in stark contrast, defined by a series of market events underpinned by structural issues that quickly spread into nearly every area of the digital asset industry – and beyond. The market turmoil of 2022 will be remembered with the collapse of Terra Luna and its stablecoin UST, and later the bankruptcy filings of Three Arrows Capital, Voyager ( VYGVQ ), Celsius Network and BlockFi. And to cap the year, the failure of FTX, including the contagion that occurred as a result, has gone down as of one of the largest cases of fraud in the history of U.S. financial markets. In addition, over the year, bitcoin prices made consistent lower lows, resulting in a prolonged bear market sentiment. Fast forward to 2023, we are now dealing with a series of significant market-moving events driving inflation to multi-decade highs. Perhaps most notably, the pace of interest rate hikes in the U.S. has dampened the bond portfolios of banks, wiping out capital buffers – earmarked by the recent banking failures of Signature ( SBNY ), Silvergate and Silicon Valley Bank. In the wake of the collapse of prominent crypto firms and contagion concerns, the starting point for cryptocurrency investment decisions should center on risk management... and then risk management again. Liquidity and Price Discovery Time and time again, with volatility in the underlying crypto markets, we see a migration of investors moving from more crypto native spot platforms to futures. We saw it on November 8, 2022, following the FTX collapse, when CME Group Cryptocurrency products were traded in record numbers. On March 13, 2023, with the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, CME Group Cryptocurrency futures once again proved their use case and saw their best trading day of the year, exceeding 90,500 contracts (representing more than $4.6 billion in notional traded). The Value of a Regulated Marketplace With uncertain and volatile markets, the ability to borrow and go short spot crypto has dried up. As such, futures have become the venue in which institutions can efficiently gain short exposure. This underscores the role that a regulated futures marketplace plays for the industry in terms of continuity of risk transfer and price discovery. Turbulence in the broader crypto market has increased the use case for CME Group’s Cryptocurrency futures and options for a number of key reasons. First, our regulated product suite continues to offer deep liquidity and price discovery with growth in both volume and open interest. Since the launch of Bitcoin futures just over five years ago in 2017, and Ether Futures in 2021, CME Group’s transparent rules, regulations and operational controls have helped to consistently allow customers to manage cryptocurrency risk against rapid price swings and other market-moving events. Battle-tested functionality like dynamic circuit breakers are in place to monitor significant price movements, while also allowing price discovery to continue, even amid rapid price fluctuations. Position limits protect customers against the risk of over-concentrated positions by a small number of participants. Cryptocurrency futures are cash-settled contracts and margins are set in line with the volatility and liquidity profile of the asset, affording market participants greater predictability regardless of price fluctuations. As a regulated derivatives exchange, CME Group also maintains segregated customer accounts at both the clearing house and clearing firm levels. Futures Commission Merchants (FCMs) act as intermediaries and serve as a risk buffer between the customer and the exchange where the trade occurs. The clearinghouse becomes the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer and guarantees the clearing and settlement of transactions on the exchange. Futures and Cash in Alignment CME Group Cryptocurrency futures settle on the last Friday of every contract month to the Bitcoin Reference Rate or Ether-Dollar Reference Rate . Both are regulated benchmarks under European Benchmark Regulation and have expert oversight committees. The reference rates are published daily at 4 p.m. London time and are derived from bitcoin-dollar or ether-dollar transactions from six leading cryptocurrency spot exchanges. As more participants start trading in both spot and derivative markets, we see the development of a highly interrelated ecosystem, bringing the price discovery that’s happening in futures in alignment with the cash markets. It could be said that recent events might actually accelerate the next wave of institutional crypto adoption, rather than impede it.

42420769,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqmCr,1682045023,"Heavy Demand for Madlads NFT Breaks Internet, Delays Mint","One of the hottest non-fungible token (NFT) mints in Solana’s recent history is getting pushed into Friday after a groundswell of interest in the Madlads collection broke the internet infrastructure behind it.  The Madlads collection – a project closely tied to the growing realm of Solana duo Armani Ferrante and Tristan Yver – will open to public minters at 7 p.m. ET (23:00 UTC) Friday, an account tied to the supercharged non-fungible token (NFT) project tweeted late Thursday.  Delaying nearly 24 hours could buy Madlads’ creators time to solve a problem they didn’t think to expect: way too much internet traffic. “Billions” of requests routed through the crypto wallet Backpack (itself a production from Ferrante and Yver) outpaced the platform’s abilities, effectively resulting in a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack.  “This is orders of magnitude more insane than anything we've dealt with up until this point,” Ferrante said on a Twitter Spaces with about 9,500 listeners, explaining why the mint was being pushed back.  New kind of NFT  The delay came after a day of electric interest in Ferrante’s and Yver’s custom take on NFTs. They’re called xNFTs, and they’re more than just a JPEG on a blockchain: They also represent “tokenized code representing ownership rights over its execution,” according to the website of Blue Coral Inc., the duo’s startup that focuses on Solana development.  Madlads is meant to be the first xNFT.  On the Twitter Spaces, Ferrante recounted a cascading series of internet outages that restricted the public’s chance to access the mint, first for an hour, then a day. He said heavy demand knocked out two RPC nodes (access points to the Solana blockchain) and also the user interface on Cloudflare, which, among other things, tries to prevent DDoS attacks.  Popular demand for the collection of novel JPEGs has already likely spelled a signup boom for Coral’s wallet app, Backpack. That’s the only Solana wallet where would-be owners can mint the Madlads collection, and also the only wallet that supports it, given market leader Phantom isn’t playing.  The palpable excitement among Solana’s developer community manifested in unexpected ways as NFT traders searched for any edge that might guarantee them access to the collection.  Some desperate seekers even followed the advice of a Substack post that implied, erroneously, that buying into custom RPC nodes from Solana developer project Helius could benefit would-be minters.  The signups to Helius’ $19.99 “Hacker plan” grew so much Thursday that it prompted CEO Mert Mumtaz to ward off the ill-informed.  “While I appreciate you thinking of us, it's important to understand that this RPC won't actually increase your chances of minting a Madlad all that much, if at all,” Mumtaz posted in Helius’ Discord server midday Thursday.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin continued its two-day swoon, dropping below $28K at one point. The head of research at Canadian crypto asset manager 3iQ linked its decline to U.S. regulatory woes and also noted that ""market liquidity remains heavily tilted to Asia.""  Insights: With MiCA and a separate crypto-related rule, European legislators have built a promising, regulatory foundation for digital assets.

So wrote Mark Connors, the head of research at Canadian crypto asset manager 3iQ, in a series of texts discussing BTC's stumble from what seemed safe heights above $30,000.  ""The Kabuki theatre that unfolded in Washington this week suggests Asia and other jurisdictions will continue to gain market share from the U.S., Connors wrote to CoinDesk, adding: ""Coinbase’s decision to get licensed in Bermuda to launch an exchange as early as next week shows that U.S. digital asset companies are now voting with their feet. So this week we had both price and regulatory volatility, with only one clear loser, the U.S. economy.""  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $28,100, down about 2.7% over the past 24 hours. But earlier on Thursday, bitcoin fell briefly to $27,991 on Coinbase, its lowest level since April 9. The decline continued a two-day slump that started early Wednesday amid a hot U.K. inflation report and massive sell-off on Binance. BTC is down about 10% from last week's high near $31,000 with investors more fretful than upbeat about crypto assets' path forward.  Connors noted that ""market liquidity remains heavily tilted to Asia, so he was ""not surprised to see bitcoin's downswing start as markets in that part of the world closed. ""Remember, last May and June dislocations occurred in a similar window,"" he wrote.  Ether was recently changing hands at about $1,936, off a few fractions of a point and well off its recent, Shanghai upgrade highs above $2,100. Other major cryptos were largely in the red, mostly darker shades. XRP, the token of the XRP open-source public blockchain XRP Ledger, and ARB, the native crypto of the Arbitrum layer 2 blockchain, were both down more than 3.5%. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets overall performance, was recently down 1.3%.  Equity markets fell, albeit not severely, with the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500, which has a strong technology component, off 0.8% and 0.6%, respectively. Gold hovered comfortably over $2,000, suggesting that investor appetites for assets that hold their value in good times and bad remained strong.  Despite encouraging first-quarter earnings from a number of major banks, investors remain warily watchful, given the decline of a number of important economic indicators that may foreshadow recession. Recent jobs data has indicated a fall-off in the torrid employment market, and on Thursday, the National Association of Realtors monthly report showed home prices registering their biggest decline since 2012 and mortgage rates rising.  Meanwhile, Connors wrote that ""more volatility"" was likely in store, ""but not the [year-to-date] ‘upside’ volatility we have seen so far in 2023.""  ""We may be entering a period of consolidation as U.S. regulation dims hopes and prompts regulatory reboots by many players.

European Union legislators also passed a separate crypto-related rule known as the Transfer of Funds regulation that imposes stronger surveillance and identification requirements for crypto operators, CoinDesk’s Jack Schickler reported.  The rules were described as a ""world first” by the European Commission's Mairead McGuinness, and also an “end of the Wild West era for crypto assets,"" according to Green Party lawmaker Ernest Urtasun. The laws, which will be enforced at the state-level, still need to be officially approved by the supra-governmental body called the EU Council, are just about cleared to take effect next year. (The Council’s approval is more of a formality at this point, considering it already approved the text of the law last year.)  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  For many, MiCA represents a crucial step forward for the crypto industry. It’s the first major attempt to provide a comprehensive set of rules for crypto companies so they know in advance what they can and cannot do and where their responsibilities lie if they want to operate in the 27-nation strong trading bloc. The European Union hopes it sets the global standard (and, in some sense, is worried about MiCA’s effectiveness in the EU if similar rules are not adopted everywhere).  CoinDesk has written a number of overviews of the legal framework. But. in short, MiCA requires crypto firms – like wallet providers and exchanges – to be licensed by the EU, and comply with money laundering and terrorism finance safeguards if they want to serve EU-based customers. Some have balked at the reporting standards, which will undoubtedly weaken privacy for crypto users in the name of customer safety and national security.
