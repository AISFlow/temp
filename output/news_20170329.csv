42379356,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87Z55,1490826622,"Where to, Bitcoin? Traders Offer Mixed Opinions on Market Direction","The path forward for bitcoin prices isn't clear, market analysts say.  While some described the market to CoinDesk as bearish overall, other observers offered a more optimistic stance about the prospects for future price developments. Their input comes as bitcoin prices have largely traded rangebound in the last few days, fluctuating between $1,010 and $1,060, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  While bitcoin prices reached an all-time high of more than $1,300 earlier this month in the lead up to the US Securities and Exchange Commission ruling on the bitcoin ETF proposed by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss twins, they have fallen since. Interestingly enough, bitcoin prices were little changed when the SEC shot down a bitcoin ETF proposed by SolidX.  Others highlighted that sentiment has, for better or worse, changed in recent days. Much of the attention seems to have squared on the prospects of a possible bitcoin hard fork – and the resulting tension that has taken hold.  ""The market has seen a switch in sentiment from hope of ETF approval to the ugliness of internal fighting,"" said Charles Hayter, founder and CEO of CryptoCompare.  Fork blues?  Some analysts pointed to this ongoing dilemma when providing their overall bearish views of the market. One lingering concern is that a fork could drive down prices sharply, prompting some to hedge their bets ahead of any possible disruption.  According to Jacob Eliosoff, a cryptocurrency fund manager, the situation is becoming a key driver of that bearishness.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Bitcoin is a very fundamental market right now: the price is going down because the dev project is imploding in near civil war.""  Not all agreed with this assessment, however. OTC trader Harry Yeh struck a more practical outlook, arguing that bitcoin's upside has been limited as a result.  ""We see this as being priced in now and don't foresee major prices moves past $1,200 in the near term,"" he said.  Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Asset Management, offered similar sentiment, telling CoinDesk that ""hard fork concerns are capping upward movement"". However, he also emphasized that ""solid BTC fundamentals, interest and growth potential"" were creating a floor for prices.  While Enneking offered a moderate assessment of the situation, a handful of analysts insisted that bitcoin's long-term trend was bullish. Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform BitMEX, stated that the digital currency's recent pullbacks in price represent a ""healthy correction"".  ""The additional uncertainty surrounding the potential hard fork also acts as a price dampener,"" he added.

42379354,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87Z03,1490804027,Panasonic Among New Contributors to Hyperledger's Iroha Project,"Five new companies are contributing to Iroha, one of several projects attached to the Hyperledger blockchain initiative.  Among the companies joining is Japanese electronics conglomerate Panasonic, marking its first major foray into the blockchain space. Other firms involved include Indetail, Intec, CAC and NTT Data, the last of which is a founding member of Hyperledger.  Unveiled last year  , Iroha focuses on the creation of a framework for user-friendly applications for mobile devices. Soramitsu, which initially proposed the Iroha project, said that the firms involved will all put forward development time and resources.  ""This means they will work to develop code to create Hyperledger Iroha, contributing it to the open-source community,"" the startup said.  The ultimate goal is to develop a robust library of components that can be easily used among others running digital ledgers based on Hyperledger's technology. Specifically, the team behind Iroha seeks to create reusable components in C++ that can call from other programming languages such as GO.  Along with Iroha, the Hyperledger umbrella includes distributed ledger projects like Sawtooth Lake, Fabric and Cello.

42379352,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87Z1J,1490800074,Emirates NBD Enlists UAE Central Bank in Blockchain Check Trial,"One of the Middle East's largest banking groups is partnering with the central bank of the United Arab Emirates on a blockchain trial focused on bank check fraud.  Emirates NBD  first waded into the blockchain world last year, when it started testing the tech for payments applications and joined an expansive research and information-sharing effort backed by the Dubai government.  According to Ali Sajwani, Emirates NBD's chief information officer, those early efforts (both internal and collaborative) yielded key insights, namely that ""the technology already has some real world applications for the short to medium term"".  That led to the payments trials as well as ongoing work to apply the tech to its paper check process. Under the proposed system, the beneficiary of a cheque (as well as their bank) would be able to check whether it is valid, relying on a blockchain as a tamper-proof verification layer.  That work, Sajwani said, has continued to advance, and Emirates NBD is working with the UAE’s central bank on the initiative.  He went on to explain:  ""We are currently working with the central bank of the UAE to add the blockchain security feature to our paper cheques, so we can prove that the technology is fit for purpose at production volumes. We are very excited at this prospect and we welcome the cooperation of other banks and institutions in developing the use case into not only a new standard for cheques but also to develop best practices that we can apply in other use cases.""  Remittance work  In comments, Sajwani also touched on the bank’s participation in a cross-border payments trial with India-based banking institution ICICI.  That test, unveiled in October, involved transmitting a transaction between an ICICI branch in Mumbai to an Emirates NBD branch in Dubai, recording on a distributed ledger.  When asked about the results, Sajwani said that while informative, the test wasn’t aimed at solving immediate barriers to payments - namely speed.  ""While cross-border payments seem like a natural fit for application of blockchain technology between banks, they are largely solved with current technologies in terms of speed,"" he told CoinDesk. ""As an example, our direct remittance service to India, Pakistan, or the Philippines takes a minute today.""  At the same time, the bank positioned the test as one with an eye on the horizon, indicating that future developments around the tech could tip the scales to further applications.  “Even though today’s blockchains cannot operate with such speed and volume, we know this is only temporary. Blockchains provide tremendous potential in standardizing message flow between transacting parties and simplifying network architecture,"" Sajwani said, adding:  ""Our cross-border remittance tests aim to leverage the technology to open more channels with much less effort.""

42379361,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87ZA7,1490790680,Inside IC3: How Cornell is Advancing the Science of Bitcoin,"We’re squeezed into a small room filled with tall black server racks. Fans interweave with computers, sputtering cold air.  The whirring noise is so loud it drowns out Cornell PhD candidate Adem Efe Gencer as he explains that inside the mundane set of racks is Cornell's ambitious attempt to model the global bitcoin network – all in the name of science.  The servers, he notes, make up about half of a bitcoin testbed that comprises more than 1,200 nodes. More are in the basement below.  Called 'Miniature World', the project is named after the diorama copies of real-world places presented at tourist attractions. Except, rather than toy cars and cardboard buildings, Miniature World models bitcoin's sprawling network of nodes.  Gencer remarks:  ""I don’t think there’s any other institution with such a big cluster.""  The most obvious question then, is, what are they doing with this massive complex of nodes? Gencer is a part of IC3, a Cornell arm that's dedicated solely to the study of cryptocurrencies, and he's studying how the system as a whole may react to a different rules or possible adversarial conditions.  The team has big plans for the 'little' network.  ""We want to expand it. The ultimate goal is to make it as large as the bitcoin public network,"" he said.  To be clear, that's a lot of nodes. According to bitcoin network statistics from Bitnodes, there are nearly 7,000, but including non-listening nodes (those that don't accept new connections to other nodes), the count adds up to more than 50,000.  Bitcoin science  Paired with this testbed, Cornell has developed a framework for what Gencer views as a more ""principled"" way of comparing protocols, one that involves measuring metrics such as delays in passing information and the system's resilience to centralization.  Miniature World is capable of running any client or more inventive protocols, like Bitcoin-NG, which radically re-engineers bitcoin with the goal of scaling it to support more transactions.  ""As long as a client is given to our system, we can run it,"" he said.  Gencer framed this way of measuring affects to the network in contrast to the systems bitcoin uses in its decision-making today – some would argue to questionable effect.  ""There's another approach in bitcoin community that is quite popular, which is discussion,"" Gencer joked, alluding to the constant dialogue on social media platforms such as Twitter and Reddit.  Others have suggested that simulations aren't perfect yet, either, given that the technology is in its early stages and it's difficult still to tell where they're effective.  Falcon network  Miniature World isn’t IC3's only bitcoin project, however.  Falcon  , which launched last year, is one of the institution's more notable public blockchain efforts, aiming as it does to help decentralize the bitcoin network.  The network, made up of 10 nodes maintained by Cornell, provides a 'fast lane' that miners and mining pools of all sizes can use to send and receive blocks more quickly.  ""This equalizes the playing field [between miners] a lot,"" said Cornell graduate student Soumya Basu while white-boarding the system.  To date, Falcon has been lauded for offering a second bitcoin relay network to help miners propagate blocks across the network more quickly. Previously, there was only one: FIBRE, formerly known as the Bitcoin Relay Network.  Basu emphasized that a diversity of options could be useful for miners.  ""If you only have one relay network and it goes down for some reason (maintenance, being attacked, etc), then block propagation becomes much slower for that time period,"" he said.  IC3 co-director Emin Gün Sirer agreed, arguing that with additional implementations, users don't have to put trust in just one open-source network and the volunteer group that maintains it.  Real impact  Again, the project isn't there just for efficiency's sake.  In interview, Basu argued that having multiple initiatives like Falcon could help bitcoin better achieve its goals by minimizing trust.  ""Relay networks are in a position of power. If a relay network decides to propagate some blocks slower than other blocks, they can make attacks such as selfish mining easier to pull off,"" he said.  Here, Basu hinted at how Cornell is interested in the game theory behind bitcoin as well.  ""If you have multiple relay networks propagating blocks, then the benefit of slowing down a particular miner's block is very limited,"" he said.  Basu, Sirer and IC3 associate director Ittay Eyal, the drivers of the project, also say they have come up with an innovation – called 'cut-through routing,' that's now included in FIBRE – which increases the speed at which the network can propagate blocks.  Widening scope  Today, Cornell's Miniature World is one of a number of notable bitcoin simulators. Although there are others including one open-sourced by Swiss technology university Eth Zürich.  But, it's also seeking to maintain a lead by expanding its work to other notable blockchain and cryptocurrency projects.  To that end, Gencer said Cornell is working on a version of ethereum that will run on the same infrastructure as the current testbed.  He said:  ""As far as we know, no one's doing this for ethereum right now.""

42379355,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87Z3p,1490787044,Economic Forum Highlights China's Rise in Blockchain R&D,"Blockchain technology will likely boost financial inclusion, but there's still some way to go before a major impact is felt, according to industry experts speaking in China last week.      At the 2017 Boao Forum for Asia annual conference in Hainan Province, speakers including Li Lihui, former president of the Bank of China, and Shi Wenchao, president of Chinese bank card provider UnionPay, discussed blockchain and digital currencies, and how they view developments in the technology.      Proving the tech's credibility in finance remains the top obstacle, according to Li, who now heads the Blockchain Research Working Group at the National Internet Finance Association of China.      ""Blockchain is able to establish credibility for individuals and to incorporate regulations into smart contracts,"" Li said at the Boao event.      He added:      ""If the technology can solve such issues, its applications will have a significant impact on inclusive financing and improve the value of finance.""              Ellen Richey, vice chairman of risk and public policy at Visa, also at the panel session, spoke of a prototype that her company is developing for consumers.      Connecting car dealers, car insurance companies and loan services, the platform uses blockchain to share the identity information of car buyers. In this way, it avoids the need for multiple documents to be filled with the same information time and time again, according to Richey.      ""It is soon to be ready for commercial use,"" she said during the discussion. ""And we believe more applications at this level will be available in the following years.""    Challenges ahead    Still, while such projects are indicative of the high hopes for the technology, progress has been slow, according to the panelists.      ""We still haven't had a breakthrough for the core technology including consensus algorithms and smart contracts. And the lack of a standardized regulation is also a pressing issue,"" Li said.      Another challenge for blockchain is the profit model, according to Shi.      ""It will be a problem if such an investment cannot find a way to justify its cost,"" he said.      Shi also argued that more extensive use of decentralized blockchain platforms needs to be driven by centralized organizations.      He said:      ""Almost all the R&D in blockchain technology that has achieved substantial progress is led by centralized organizations. Otherwise, we cannot locate an entity to be in charge.""              Li agreed, saying that, whether it's IBM or R3, ""what they are researching on are multiple centralizations instead a complete decentralization.”      While UnionPay has built a blockchain R&D team, Shi concluded that he doesn't believe the emerging technology will disrupt its operating model in the short term.

42379351,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87YxX,1490783415,Survey: Europe's Online Shoppers Are Wary of Digital Currencies,"European consumers are largely shunning digital currencies when making e-commerce payments, according to a recent survey commissioned by MasterCard.  The online survey polled just under 43,000 people between the ages of 18 and 64, from 23 different countries, who said they shop online. The results revealed that just 2% of respondents who make mobile payments for e-commerce said they use digital currencies, an amount mirrored when the group was asked about shopping online from a PC or laptop.  The report also included data on overall interest in new payment types, with the survey focusing on a list that included digital currencies, banking apps, e-wallets and QR code scanning. Digital currencies ranked last, with 11% of respondents expressing interest.  MasterCard also reported that, based on the countries it surveyed, Spain was the top country for consumer interest in digital currency, followed by Croatia and Italy.  That the firm would seek input on the thinking of online spenders about digital currencies is perhaps unsurprising. Last November, the US Patent and Trademark Office published four patent applications submitted by MasterCard, which focused on integrating blockchain-based currencies into its systems.

42379360,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87Z7b,1490766519,Digital Currency Exchange ShapeShift Raises $10.4 Million Series A,"Digital currency exchange startup ShapeShift has closed a $10.4m Series A.  Led by Berlin-based Earlybird Venture Capital, the round included participation from Lakestar, Blockchain Capital, Pantera Capital and Access Venture Partners, the firm said today. Existing ShapeShift backers, including FundersClub, Digital Currency Group and Erik Voorhees (the company’s founder and CEO) also took part in the round.  The fresh capital will be used to expand the exchange's engineering team, a move that would come ahead of two exchange-related products set to be released later this year.  In interview, Voorhees said that many of those hires would come on the engineering side, both in preparation of those launches as well as an anticipate rise in volume. According to ShapeShift, platform growth has averaged 48% per month in the last three years, seeing an average monthly trade volume of about 50,000 bitcoins spread across 40 digital currencies and assets.    Although tight-lipped about the exact nature of future ShapeShift products, Voorhees indicated that both were new types of exchange, one built entirely around smart contracts.    More broadly, Voorhees spoke to the exchange's clear vision of the potential diversity of cryptocurrency tokens, which was less well understood by the industry in 2014.  He told CoinDesk:    ""What we saw when we started was that tokens were going to become a widespread phenomenon. We believed there would be blockchain tokens representing all sorts of value beyond currency, and that's become increasingly true, which is why ShapeShift's frictionless exchange is important.""    Voorhees also said that ShapeShift's policy of not holding any customer assets or other details helped to give confidence that the effect of any hacks or other breaches would be minimal.  ""We take consumer protection to a new level by not endangering them in the first place,"" he said. ""In the hack we suffered a year ago, it was the first exchange hack where customers weren't at risk either in funds or personal information.""  The funding coincides with a broader uptick in interest for alternative cryptocurrencies, with this market experiencing a recent boom some suggest is a sign it is developing into a new asset class.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in ShapeShift.
