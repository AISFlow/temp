42377256,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX706uP,1400710214,Bitcoin's Newest Merchant Peter Schiff: Gold Still Better Than BTC,"Euro Pacific Precious Metals, one the world's largest gold and silver dealers by volume, announced today that it is accepting bitcoin through merchant bitcoin processor BitPay.  Founded by famed financial personality Peter Schiff — host of popular financial radio show ""The Peter Schiff Show"" and a vocal detractor of bitcoin, the company's decision unsurprisingly reverberated throughout the bitcoin community, with many optimistic that Schiff had reversed his stance on digital currency.  However, in an interview with CoinDesk, Schiff framed his company's move as more strategic to its business goals than supportive of bitcoin itself.  Schiff told CoinDesk that his decision to accept bitcoin does not represent an about-face on his views, and that, for the moment at least, cashing in on bitcoin is simply good business, stating:  ""Chances are your average bitcoin holder is more likely to be a precious metal buyer than a person who doesn't own bitcoin. [...] I think it makes sense to target bitcoin holders as customers.""  Schiff reiterated that he's still ""a skeptic of bitcoin and other alternative currencies"", and that the move is aimed in part at capturing customers who may also be worried about the ability of bitcoin's price to rise in light of recent negative developments in the space.  Prices will go down  Schiff told CoinDesk that he personally believes the price of bitcoin will decline, and that investors would be smart to turn some of their bitcoin into gold or silver.  For example, he noted how the collapse of Mt. Gox and bitcoin's subsequent decline in value have not only created negative market sentiment, but also a compelling case that investors should diversify their assets:    ""There might be some people getting nervous about where the price is going to go. What if it goes down to $100 or lower? Maybe it will, people can take some risk off the table by buying some gold or silver.""            Further, Schiff is quick to note that he believes silver is the better buy, given that he projects it to rise from its current value of $19 to as much as $50.  He regrets not buying bitcoin  Given that Schiff was aware of the currency as far back as early 2013, he understandably regrets he didn't capitalize on bitcoin's rise in value, but said that this doesn't have any impact on his outlook for digital currencies, explaining:  ""Obviously, I could've bought them then and could've done pretty well, sure. I regret not buying a bunch of them, but that doesn't mean I'm going to buy them now.""  He continued, explaining that his company is unlikely to hold any of the bitcoin it accepts, adding: ""We're not accepting bitcoin, we're accepting dollars. BitPay is accepting bitcoins"".  One reason is that he says he's unable to differentiate between bitcoin and the many available altcoins on the market, saying:  ""I still don't feel that any of these digital currencies are likely to survive long term. Is it possible that some may? But, then how do you know what one?""  He's considered launching his own currency  Despite the fact that he is bearish on bitcoin's potential, Schiff told CoinDesk that he has also considered a digital currency project, similar to the one adopted by NoFiatCoin — using gold and silver to back the coin.  However, he says his uncertainty about the process ultimately led him to abandon the idea:  ""I thought it would be very expensive to do it and I didn't know how much money I could make, because I'd have to back it by gold and I couldn't really mark it up that much.""  Still, Schiff seemed to suggest that he sees a potential application for bitcoin as a technology, even if he believes the currency is not a great investment, stating that governments could launch asset-backed digital currencies in the future.

42377273,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX707DH,1400708409,Meet the US Politicians Who Are Embracing Bitcoin,"The long-awaited decision by the US Federal Election Commission (FEC) to allow political candidates to solicit campaign contributions in bitcoin was issued earlier this May, effectively giving campaigns the green-light to accept up to $100 per donor.  The decision, an advisory opinion, treats bitcoin as cash when establishing limits on donations, though they must be reported as in-kind contributions.  As a result of this announcement, a number of federal candidates have rushed to begin accepting the digital currency, joining an already strong number of local and state politicians.  However, the FEC's decision is by no means expansive. Wisconsin Alderman Mark Clear, for example, was forced to return the $100 in bitcoin that was donated to his campaign on 5th May.  He explained to CoinDesk:  ""Because I'm running for a state office, it's the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board (GAB), not the FEC, that governs the election.""  But, while Clear and his campaign has not yet been able to take in any bitcoin fundraising, he is one of the many US politicians helping to increase awareness nationwide.  Here are the other forward-thinking candidates currently accepting bitcoin:  Greg Abbott, Candidate for Governor, Texas  The state attorney general for Texas since 2002, Abbott recently announced he would seek to become governor following the announcement that governor and former Republican presidential hopeful Rick Perry would not seek a fourth term in office.  Abbott is currently collecting bitcoin donations via his websitehttps://www.gregabbott.com/bitcoin-donation-form/, which notes that Texas law allows political campaigns to ""accept contributions of currency or other assets"".  Notably, Abbott has suggested that bitcoin is a reflection of his broader political ideology, stating:  ""Something as innovative as bitcoin is an opportunity for us to continue this focus, especially given the fact that it embodies free market principles, which Texans are very fond of.""  Bob Barr, Candidate for US Representative, Georgia  A former four-term Congressman, Barr was first elected to the US House of Representatives in 1994. But recently announced he would accept donations for a new bid for a seat in Congress via Georgia-based merchant processor BitPay.  In 2008, Barr was the Libertarian presidential nominee, running against candidates John McCain and Barack Obama, though he ultimately only received 0.4% of the general election vote.  Barr is campaigning on a platform that calls for the federal government to cut taxes and spending. If re-elected, reports suggest he would be the first US Representative to return to office after a lengthy gap in service.  Paul Dietzel, Candidate for US Representative, Louisiana  A Republican from Louisiana's 6th Congressional district, Dietzel is running on a platform that calls for the US to pay back its national debt and balance its budget.  Dietzel announced via Twitter that he would accept bitcoin, and at press time, he is accepting bitcoin through his official campaign website.    Alert: now accepting BitCoin donations! Please visit http://t.co/etpZgCD1Sq and donate now! #bitcoin #FEC      — Paul Dietzel II (@PaulDietzel) May 8, 2014    Will Hammer, Candidate for US Representative, Virginia  A member of Libertarian Party of Virginia, Will Hammer took to reddit on 16th May to inform the bitcoin community that he would accept bitcoin as part of his campaign.  Hammer told CoinDesk that he is a bitcoin buyer and miner, having purchased two dedicated mining rigs. He elaborated on his passion for digital currency, saying:  ""The genius of bitcoin is that it is not only a currency but also its own payment system. I love the idea of an open source, decentralised, encrypted, convenient and finite currency that just happens to be its own payment system as well.""  In the post, Hammer noted that he is still focusing on getting out the vote for his campaign, and that he needs to collect 1,000 signatures by 10th June in order to appear on the ballot.  If elected, Hammer told the reddit community he would work to abolish the Federal Reserve.  Jared Polis, US Representative, Colorado  Congressman Jared Polis, a Colorado Democrat, is perhaps the most well-known bitcoin supporter for his satirical response letter to West Virgina Senator Joe Manchin's bid to ban bitcoin.  However, he has also provided the best demonstration to date of the benefits bitcoin donations can bring to a campaign. One week after the FEC decision, Polis raised $1,500 from 39 voters through California-based bitcoin exchange and wallet provider Coinbase.  Polis, who first took office in 2008, has since won two reelection campaigns, most recently in 2012 when he defeated Republican Kevin Lundberg with 55% of the vote.  Polis is currently raising money for his 2014 re-election campaign.  Gavin Newsom, Lieutenant Governor, California  Once a self-proclaimed bitcoin detractor, Democratic Lieutenant Governor Newsom now says he is ""fascinated"" by the technology.  Announcing his decision via the San Francisco Chronicle on 20th May, Newsom wasted no time upping the ante for his own acceptance, even joking with Jared Polis that he aims to raise more than the Colorado Democrat in bitcoin donations.    Hey @jaredpolis, thanks for leading the way. My mission? To raise more #bitcoin than you. Game on?      — Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) May 20, 2014    Newsom is also a published author, who has written about the intersection of digital innovation and politics. His book, Citizenville, penned with Lisa Dickey, was published in February, 2013.  He is currently campaigning for reelection this fall, and has been endorsed by The Los Angeles Times.  Bryan Parker, Candidate for Mayor, Oakland, California  One of the more outspoken proponents of the potential benefits of digital currency, Parker has championed bitcoin as a way to attract more technology companies to Oakland, address poverty and increase fundraising for civic development.  Parker's platform calls for ""bold, progressive"" action to promote increased economic activity in the city.  The mayoral candidate is now accepting bitcoin through a partnership with internationally focused bitcoin merchant processor GoCoin.  Parker notably held a bitcoin fundraiser in January that featured a talk from venture capitalist and newly elected Bitcoin Foundation board member Brock Pierce.  Steve Stockman, Candidate for Senator, Texas  A tenured politician who has served in various elected positions — including as a member of the House of Representatives — since the mid-1990s, Stockman is now accepting bitcoin donations through BitPay on his official campaign websitehttps://stockman2014.com/bitcoin-donation.  Stockman notably made waves in the bitcoin community when he appeared at Inside Bitcoins NYC in April to declare he planned to introduce a new bill, the 'Virtual Currency Tax Reform Act', that would seek to question the IRS' ruling that bitcoin is property.  Stockman was positive in his remarks about the technology at the time, stating:  ""We need to encourage [bitcoin], not discourage it. There is risk associated with every budding industry in America.""

The partnership will be on display during the tour’s upcoming event at The Complex in Salt Lake City on 12th June.  There, concert-goers will have the opportunity to spend bitcoin at participating concession stands, and Coinbase and Budweiser will promote the event by distributing US$10 worth of bitcoin to eligible concert-goers.  The BMIA Concert Series  began in April in Madison, Wisconsin, and runs through the end of August with shows in Philadelphia and Los Angeles.  The promotion notably follows Coinbase's decision to provide $10 in BTC to students who sign up for its service, and could be seen as its latest bid to enroll younger users.  Limited supply  To participate, concertgoers need to opt-in when they register for their tickets on the BMIA Concert Series website. They agree to receive an invitation to create a Coinbase wallet, connecting the user to the company’s service.  After going through the normal registration process for a Coinbase wallet, the user is credited the US$10 in bitcoin, Budweiser explained.  US residents are eligible to opt-in, although Budweiser noted that the offer does not apply to residents of California, Ohio and Texas.  The company added that there is a limited supply of bitcoins available.  Bitcoin in entertainment  Bitcoin is slowly but surely making inroads in the entertainment and sporting industries, most notably in the US.  Earlier this month, the San Jose Earthquakes announced that it would integrate bitcoin payments - also facilitated by Coinbase - at its home stadium. Like the BMIA Concert Series, attendees will be able to use bitcoin to pay for items at concession stands.  However, this trend is being seen on the international stage as well.  In March, Polish soccer club GKS Katowice announced plans to accept bitcoin. At the time, chief executive Wojciech Cygan told CoinDesk that the club was ""open to new technologies"".

42377255,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX706vf,1400701525,"Bitcoin Foundation Holds $4 Million in Bitcoin, Spends $150k Each Month","The Bitcoin Foundation has released its annual Members Meeting Transcript, a 22-page document that provides a broad overview of the non-profit's recent initiatives as well as its future plans for promoting bitcoin around the globe.  Perhaps most notably, the Bitcoin Foundation revealed new details about its finances, with Executive Director Jon Matonis indicating the company is now spending $150,000 per month on its operations, or roughly $1.8m per year.  Matonis went on to note that the foundation has $4.6m equivalent in assets, and that 90% of its assets are in bitcoin. However, he suggested at the height of bitcoin's price increase, the foundation had accumulated roughly $7m in assets.  The Executive Director said that the foundation is likely to pursue plans to continue to improve how it uses the funds it earns from individual members, corporate members and anonymous donations, stating:  ""The strategy going forward and with revamping the fees is that we will be able to continue and expand our budget without going cash flow negative and without borrowing from our endowment.""  At present, Matonis said the foundation is not cashflow positive, and that it is borrowing about 40% from its endowment each month.  Expanding operations  The board discussed its progress on one of its main initiatives for 2014, spreading awareness for bitcoin abroad through the addition of affiliate programmes, which most recently included new chapters in Mexico, Germany and the Netherlands.  Matonis indicated that the foundation is currently aiming to grow to 18 affiliate programmes by the end of the year, noting that the approach provides the organisation with a low-cost way to expand its footprint.  Overall, Matonis suggested the foundation and its members may adopt a more active approach that targets key global markets, stating:  ""We may decide that India is a great place to go into and plant our flag there and really make a push in India. Go into China and really make a push there. These don’t have to be the things that are driven by whether or not those countries are ready, we can proactively steer that.""  He reiterated that these local chapters need not change their rules or by-laws to join the programme and that all appointments are subject to a two-year agreement that either party can terminate.  Educating lawmakers  Addressing the need for more favourable bitcoin regulation, board members suggested that the foundation may see this as more of a long-term goal.  For example, Matonis noted the lawmakers must be first educated about bitcoin and its potential benefits before tackling any policy issues. This isn't to say that the foundation doesn't intend to expand its efforts to increase awareness of bitcoin among global lawmakers, he said.  Matonis continued, saying that the foundation is currently in the process of taking what it learned from dealing with regulators in the US and replicating it in key jurisdictions:  ""Brussels obviously is top on that list. London is high on the list. I would say that after that, we would start looking at the places in Asia as well.""  Increasing facetime  In regards to criticisms about the board members' own interactions with the community, the foundation noted that it would like to see a greater use of its online community forum, which is currently only used by roughly 10% to 15% of its membership.  Further, Matonis said the foundation is taking steps to ensure the community that does use this channel has its concerns addressed in a timely fashion, stating:  ""We just hired resource part time to be that interface so that if there’s things that are getting unanswered that are really important, we promoted our moderator to be the member communicator on the forums which I think is a very positive step because now things will get answered.""  Future for conference series  The foundation revealed that it is not currently earning proceeds from its annual conference, the most recently of which – Bitcoin2014 – took place in Amsterdam last weekend.  Matonis suggested that the foundation is exploring the idea of licensing out future conferences, but that it would seek member input on such decisions.  ""We currently have an opportunity to do that similar to the way that the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) does it in Las Vegas or in Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. We’re looking into those options.""  Board member controversies  Matonis also discussed the controversial resignations of former board members Charlie Shrem and Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles, stating that the board was fortunate that both members resigned voluntarily:  ""They recognized both on their own that it was the appropriate thing for them to do for the foundation, for the membership and also for bitcoin to resign from the foundation. There were no votes or anything that were held to eject them. I think that we’re very fortunate that that’s the way that it happened.""  Board members also briefly answered a member question relating to the recent appointment of venture capitalist Brock Pierce, with unidentified one board member stating:  ""Generally, I think that kind of thing is a huge distraction for us and it does take resources and time and energy and I would prefer we not have to do that.""

In a post on popular blogging platform Medium, Neville discussed a host of topics, including how the company will plan to monetize its service, how it will deal with bitcoin's price volatility and how it aims to insure customer funds from security threats.  Overall, Neville framed the post as a way for the company to respond to the many ""reasonable questions"" Circle had received from the community after its highly-publicized debut.  Perhaps most notably, however, Neville addressed how the company aims to offer instant access to bitcoin banking and storage free of charge, revealing that Circle intends to develop a line of high-level, revenue-generating products to support its drive for more mainstream consumers, adding:  ""We’re interested in the long-term value of digital money, not optimizing for minor short-term profit.""  The news follows the official debut of Circle's first product, Circle.com, at the Bitcoin2014 conference in Amsterdam.  Not a trading platform  Neville went on to talk about Circle's fiat-to-bitcoin conversion rate, noting that it may fluctuate to be higher or lower than other exchange services, but that the company does not view this as a margin for producing revenue.  The CTO also compared Circle's revenue strategy to larger issues relating to Internet monetization, saying:  ""The Internet wants movement of information on its rails to be free, or very close to free, and revenue-generating value to be built on top of those basic democratized rails.""  Further, Neville suggested that those who deposit – buy – bitcoin via its service via credit card will need to pay the associated interchange fees.  Not self-insured  In response to questions about how it Circle insuring customer deposits against security threats, Neville provided a cursory overview of the business relationships that support this initiative:  ""We worked hard to secure an initial policy that covers 100% of assets under management – that includes all customer balances as well as Circle reserves – through underwriters with excellent S&P ratings.""  He went on to speculate that more companies in the bitcoin ecosystem will adopt insurance policies as a means to attract more consumers.  Not done yet  While Neville did not provide many details, he also hinted that Circle will seek to further define its product, noting that ""not all intended features are yet present"".  In particular, he suggested the company may be considering novel ways to ensure Circle customers aren't exposed to bitcoin's price volatility, stating:  ""We have a specific approach in mind for addressing volatility and will debut that when it’s more mature.""  He concluded by asking the community for its continued patience as it develops its products, adding: ""We are quite seriously trying to change the world, and we are prepared for that to take time"".

42377249,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX706pN,1400693569,European Central Bank: Bitcoin a Risky Alternative to Euro,"European Central Bank (ECB) executive board member Yves Mersch said during a speech on 19th May that as a payment system and a store of value, the euro is superior to digital alternatives like bitcoin.  Mersch was speaking at Cash Symposium 2014, a day-long event held in Frankfurt on 19th May by the Bundesbank, Germany’s central bank.  His talk focused on euro banknotes and their performance, and their characteristics as a system of payment.  Touching upon digital currencies as an emerging payment method, Mersch remarked that a lack of significant transaction fees makes them attractive to consumers, saying:  “Their special feature is that payments are made directly between the participants without a bank as an intermediary. The elimination of any bank charges achieved in this way is often claimed to be an advantage.”  However, he went on to say that “exchange rate losses can quickly cancel out this advantage"", a characteristic that he suggested makes it a poor alternative to the euro.  Security and legality  Mersch commented that the legal and security complexities in the bitcoin market make it difficult for consumers to completely understand the process, even though acquiring a wallet and purchasing digital currency is not inherently difficult.  This lack of consumer insight, Mersch stated, opens the door to greater risks, saying:  ""Although interested parties can very easily download the application for bitcoin, they neither understand how this payment system works exactly, nor the risks they run when using it.""  By comparison, Mersch said that euro banknotes possess ""a modern design and the latest security features"".  Regional currency  Notably, Mersch sought to identify bitcoin as a regional rather than a truly global payment system.  There are ""probably a maximum of 2 million bitcoin users"" within the broader network, he noted, and that ""only a few thousand business and services providers which accept bitcoins"" exist.  The latter figure runs counter to statements from payments companies in the bitcoin ecosystem that have claimed tens of thousands of merchant and organization customers.  Mersch said that bitcoin, owing to the size of its network and the fewer number of participants relative to traditional global payment networks, could be called a “regional currency of the Internet”.  Previous statements  The ECB official’s comments reflect earlier statements made in regards to bitcoin this year.  In March, Mersch spoke at the ECB/Banca d’Italia Workshop on Interchange Fees, where he suggested that bitcoin was ""too small"" to have an impact on banking or retail payments.  At the time, Mersch left the door open to the digital currency’s future role as a bigger payment system.

42377265,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7079V,1400688082,Coincove Launches With Plan to Become 'Coinbase of Mexico',"Coincove is bringing a Coinbase-like wallet and exchange service to Mexico with its public launch today, allowing users to covert peso bank transfers into bitcoin.  Tomas Alvarez, a co-founder of the company, told CoinDesk that the service is important to bitcoin adoption in the Latin American country.  In the past, he indicated, it has been difficult to make the peso-to-bitcoin conversion, which sometimes meant having to deal with foreign exchanges.  “[Mexican users previously] didn’t have a way to get bitcoins except for wiring money to Bitstamp, or before to Mt. Gox,” said Alvarez.  Bringing the unbanked onboard  Coincove  has been operating a private beta over the past few months with approximately 250 users.  Alvarez expects that, initially, most of Coincove’s post-beta customers will already be familiar with bitcoin. Over time, though, the company’s plan is to encourage more people into using the digital currency.  Bitcoin in Mexico is currently all about wagering on its price, as Alvarez readily admits, but there are some very promising use cases for digital currencies in that country – especially in services for the unbanked.  With that in mind, the company's aim is to promote its wallet as an easy-onramp into bitcoin, as well as a springboard into faster financial transactions.  These will be off-block chain and will not require confirmations to complete, said Alvarez, explaining:  “[The] benefit is [really] instant transactions; user-to-user. For normal users, I think that is a very important feature.”  Remittances targeted  Another big opportunity for Coincove is in remittance – for the most part, money being sent from the US to Mexico. ""We are actually talking with some bitcoin ATM companies to integrate remittance,"" said Alvarez.  The company believes Texas is an ideal state for testing US-to-Mexico digital currency remittance.  A recent ruling in Texas means bitcoin exchanges do not require money transmission licences there. The same situation exists in Mexico, making for an ideal corridor to start trialling US-to-Mexico bitcoin remittance services, said Alvarez, adding:  ""Texas says it is a digital asset. Mexico says it is a digital asset. You don’t need licences to start testing the system.""  Over $20bn in remittances were sent from the US to its southern neighbour in 2013. According to the World Bank, the average cost of sending $200 from either a bank or money operator from the US to Mexico is $8.40.  Reducing those fees is an opportunity to take market share from incumbent players and is a key reason why Coincove and competitor Bitso are planning to move into the remittances arena.  Relaxed regulatory attitude  Mexico's policymakers appear to be taking a wait-and-see approach towards bitcoin, according to Alvarez:  “I talked to some representatives from the Bank of Mexico a few weeks ago. And they say that, for the moment, they’ll treat bitcoin as a digital asset.”  This means Coincove doesn’t have to follow the same type of KYC (know your customer) and AML (anti-money laundering) procedures that traditional financial institutions in the country have to.  Even so, they have decided to play it safe and put such procedures in place anyway:  “We are acting as a financial institution every though we are not required to,” said Alvarez.  About the company  Coincove recently completed the Boost VC startup incubator programme. During its time at the accelerator, it shifted its focus from remittances in Argentina – primarily made because of that country’s policy stance on bitcoin.  Coincove has spent a lot of time in the US in order to raise money and build its business, but it also plans to have a base of operations in Guadalajara, Mexico.  Alvarez says that Coincove has already hired one developer in the city and believes that it is vital to be as close to the company’s userbase as possible:  “At least the development team, we think, should be in Mexico. The feedback loop [for users] is faster and more efficient.""  Coincove is now open for public registration. According to recent prices on its website, 1 BTC is worth around $5,882 MXN.

Bitcoin integration at the team's Buck Shaw Stadium will take place on 25th May, in time for the Earthquakes' match with Houston Dynamo. Coinbase is acting as the stadium’s bitcoin payments processor, leveraging the exchange’s tablet app to accept payments.  Team President Dave Kaval told CoinDesk that the the organization became interested in bitcoin thanks to nearby Silicon Valley’s strong association with the digital currency, saying:  “We felt that, talking to a lot of our fans, especially in Silicon Valley, there were people who had inquired about whether or not we actually accepted bitcoin in the stadium. That kind of fed off inquiries on our side.”  Bitcoin rollout  The Earthquakes are planning on integrating bitcoin payments at a number of key areas at Buck Shaw Stadium. Game attendees can use bitcoin to buy tickets at the box office and additionally will be able to pay for concessions at certain locations and buy merchandise at the stadium gift shop.  Kaval said that while not every point-of-sale terminal will be ready to accept bitcoin on 25th May, he said that more support will be added soon after.  He noted that the Earthquakes team is expecting a strong turnout for bitcoin-using customers, saying that many people in the area are familiar with digital currencies and are looking for opportunity to spend their bitcoins:  “I think we’re gonna have more people than we think. I think it will attract a lot of new fans and people.”  Entertainment role  Kaval suggested that, like credit cards, bitcoin could easily be integrated as an alternative payment method at sports arenas and and other entertainment centres, adding that it’s a matter of allowing the technology to catch on with consumers:  “If you think back to the ’80s or early ’90s, you would go to a lot of places and they wouldn’t accept credit cards. Especially concerts and things like that – it was all cash. So think about how far that’s come.”  Kaval went on to say that integrating bitcoin enables entertainment venues to tap into payment methods that are easiest for customers. Otherwise, venues run the risk of failing to capitalize on that nascent demand.  Other sports clubs have adopt bitcoin as a form of payment this year. In March, Polish soccer club GKS Katowice announced that fans could use bitcoin to pay for tickets and buy merchandise.  At the start of the year, the Sacramento Kings became the first NBA team to begin accepting bitcoin payments. The franchise later opened a bitcoin-only online store.

42377248,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX703Tn,1400677049,Julian Assange: Bitcoin is a Major 'Intellectually Interesting Development',"Wikileaks founder Julian Assange has issued a glowing endorsement of bitcoin, labelling it ""the most intellectually interesting development in the last two years"".  The 42-year-old Australian national was speaking via video link this morning at the Net Prophet technology and trends conference, taking place in Cape Town, South Africa.  He believes  the next major innovation the world will witness involves the finance sector, and he suggests bitcoin will have a part to play in this.  Assange emphasised that traditional financial systems require laws to govern their operation, but digital currency doesn't – the code behind it makes sure transactions are carried out correctly.  He emphasised his support of a financial system not controlled by regulators, claiming that the absence of regulation has enabled bitcoin and other cryptographic protocols to evolve and innovate incredibly quickly.  However, he conceded that the innovative nature of cryptocurrency and the financial diversity it facilitates has created difficulties for those working in the space. For example, a number of banks across the world have blocked customer involvement with bitcoin and even closed the accounts of some companies operating within the digital currency sphere.  A great proponent of decentralisation, Assange said there is a need for more decentralisation of centralised organisations across the globe, and not just those involved in finance.  Assange was speaking from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he has been residing for over 700 days while battling extradition.  He remains under investigation by the US government since WikiLeaks published leaked military and diplomatic documents in 2010. That same year, he was accused of sexual offences against two women in Sweden.  Assange has said he will go to Sweden to face these allegations if he is given a diplomatic guarantee that he will not be turned over to the US.  Last year, Bitcoin donations to WikiLeaks spiked after Assange pledged his support to whistle-blower Edward Snowden.  In January of this year, WikiLeaks revealed via Twitter that the majority of its public funding now comes through bitcoin and litecoin donations.  Wikileaks image via haak78 / Shutterstock.com.

Despite warnings from the litecoin community across forums like reddit, the pool briefly crossed the 50% mark this week – leaving the litecoin network vulnerable to a so-called ‘51% attack’.  A 51% attackhttps://ripple.com/wiki/Bitcoin_51PercentAttack allows an attacker to make double-spend transactions, reverse transactions, prevent confirmations and corrupt the network.  The total hash rate of the litecoin network stands at 212.947 GH/s and Coinotron’s hash rate peaked at 115 GH/s. The litecoinpool chart below pegs the pool's current hashrate at 102 GH/s.  Although Coinotron has urged users to leave, its response has not gone down well with the community. Users have been criticising the pool over its failure to address the issue on the Coinotron bitcointalk thread.  Coinotron insists it is working to resolve the problem, but some community members feel it is simply not doing enough, with miners also shouldering part of the blame.  Although the situation has improved over the last few hours – Coinotron claims its hash rate has gone down from 115 GH/s to 93 GH/s – it is still litecoin's biggest mining pool by far.  Are ASICs to blame?  An increasing number of specialist scrypt ASICs have gone online in recent weeks, and their appearance has amplified the problem of centralisation on the network.  Most of these ASICs are operated by relatively large miners, the top five account for about 50 GH/s. This means the network is anything but decentralized, yet many of these big miners are not solo mining – they are in the Coinotron pool.  More ASIC miners are on the way, so it is also possible that a sudden influx of new ASICs distributed between alternative pools will help level the playing field.  Bitcoin experienced a similar crisis  Back in January the bitcoin network faced a similar threat, when the Ghash.io mining pool started approaching the 51% mark. The pool took action to reduce its hash rate and issued a number of statements over the matter.  The temporary crisis led many in the community to develop a somewhat different approach which would essentially be a peer-to-peer mining pool with cross-platform support. Developers are still tackling the challenge, but so far such solutions have not been implemented on a large scale.",NEGATIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | LTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/05/21/litecoin-miners-urged-to-leave-coinotron-pool-over-51-threat,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fea9334feb61d615d2b8cc34d6b1f174949e258e-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377237,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX703Fx,1400668302,Google: KryptoKit Wallet Extension Issue Caused by Malware,"Google has managed to identify and fix a problem that started plaguing users of the bitcoin wallet extension KryptoKit yesterday and caused many to worry that their bitcoins might be irretrievably lost.  Early on 20th May, KryptoKit users started reporting that the extension was mysteriously removing itself from Chrome without prior notice. They also found that the extension had disappeared from the Chrome app store.  KryptoKit project  developers tried their best to work out a solution, but it soon became apparent that Google itself was behind the abrupt removal.  Malware alert  Google reinstated KryptoKit’s account a few hours after the issue was detected, but, it did not offer an explanation at the time.  Finally, Google’s Chrome team took to reddit last night to explain what happened, with Google Chrome Product Manager Tyler Odean apologizing for the confusion and explaining what caused the problem.  Odean stressed that no data was compromised or removed from user machines at any point, adding:  “What happened in a nutshell was that real malware was mimicking KryptoKit, which caused our blacklisting protections to get confused.”  The post indicated that the malware developer was trying to steal bitcoin keys using the KryptoKit codebase to build their own malicious extension. Much of the code was identical, so Google flagged the real KryptoKit extension, blacklisting it along with the malware version.  As soon as the issue made it to reddit, the team realised the mistake and reenabled KryptoKit on users' machines.  Bitcoin enthusiasts  Tyler went on to point out that Google has not changed its stance on bitcoin:  “Obviously this is a learning experience for us and we are continuing to perfect our protections in the webstore. But we wanted to emphasize that we are definitely not seeking to limit Bitcoin extensions in general or the KryptoKit extension in particular – but rather trying our best to keep users safe from malicious exploits.”  Interestingly, Odean said many Chrome team members are bitcoin enthusiasts, and ended his reddit post with a strong hint that he is too: “Cheers, Tyler, Bullish”.

42377232,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7039f,1400664303,New Decentralized Crowdfunding Platform Could Reshape Bitcoin Landscape,"BitcoinJ developer and former Google engineer Mike Hearn is working on a new decentralized crowdfunding platform that will support bitcoin transactions and could lead to a reshaping of the peer-to-peer finance landscape.  The crowdfunding platform, called 'Lighthouse', was announced during a talk led by Hearn at the Bitcoin2014 conference in Amsterdam. Hearn later elaborated on the announcement in a 17th May blog post.  Like other crowdfunding platforms, Lighthouse will serve as a means for users to create projects and pledge funds to others. Hearn wrote, however, that its primary aim will be to help fund more advanced features and services within the bitcoin network, explaining:  “To make these features come alive takes work, and because they’re inherently about decentralised infrastructure it’s often hard to find anyone who will pay for that work. With no way to own the infrastructure once built, many traditional funding models can’t function.”  Lighthouse is being designed to solve this problem and will provide project fundraisers with a lightweight, encryptable wallet that is build on the same code as the Android wallet app designed by Andreas Schildbach.  How it will work  Lighthouse will function on the premise of 'assurance contracts', which means that projects are funded on the basis that the money is only collected and utilized if enough money is raised. The platform will use the block chain itself to verify transactions directed toward a project.  However, the bitcoin network will only verify the transactions once the goal has been reached, said Hearn.  Additionally, users will be able to revoke their pledges before the round is complete. Lighthouse will double spend the funds back to the user’s account, freeing them up for other uses.  Hearn framed these characteristics as making the crowd funding process much easier for both project owners and contributors, saying:  “This simplifies life for everyone: the project owner doesn’t have to worry about being hacked, they can go on vacation for a while and not have to worry about handling withdrawals from the pot, and anyone who pledges knows they can get their money back whenever they like before the goal is reached.”  Decentralized solution  Cost and security, Hearn told CoinDesk, are some of the issues involved with centralized crowdfunding platform that can be solved by a service like Lighthouse.  Websites like Kickstarter can charge as much as 10% of a project’s total funds, he pointed out, making it harder for projects to successfully raise enough money:  “If you're trying to raise money from a community, that's a big problem because it's quite demoralising to wonder if you're one of the 10% of people whose pledge will just be eaten by middlemen. For smaller projects it can render the entire process unworkable.”  Hearn added that in many cases, centralized platforms impose restrictions on project creators that add to the burden of their task. Decentralization, on the other hand, empowers them to raise funds in a more proactive manner.  From a security perspective, Lighthouse protects users by not hosting private keys on any centralized server. This makes the platform a poor target for hackers or other exploiters, said Hearn.  He also cited the idea that decentralized crowdfunding allows for more comprehensive vetting processes. In turn, this helps projects prove themselves to possible donors and increase their chances of success.  With Hearn still hard at work on Lighthouse, it remains to be seen what features and characteristics will ultimately define this decentralized crowdfunding platform.
