42419487,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEfQz,1696285712,Bitcoin Slumps Below $28K as Yields Spike; Ether Futures ETFs Fizzle on Lukewarm Investor Interest,"Bitcoin (BTC) ended the first U.S. trading day of the week in the green, but it gave up some gains as the U.S. 10-year yield spiked to its highest level in more than 16 years. In the last 24 hours, the world's largest digital asset dipped into the red and is down by 1.57%. Meanwhile, the much-hyped ether futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) failed to capture the interest of investors, with low volumes reported on their first day of trading.  Bitcoin is set to end the U.S. trading day just below $28,000, up around 3%, according to CoinDesk Indices data. Meanwhile, ether is changing hands at approximately $1670, down modestly for the session. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) is higher by 1.6% over the past 24 hours.  In the equities market, stocks were mixed Monday after U.S. lawmakers over the weekend prevented a government shutdown with a stop-gap bill. Interest rates continued to push higher, with the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield soaring another 11 basis points to 4.69%. The yield rose after unexpectedly strong manufacturing data underlined the resilience of the U.S. economy, with the ISM figures coming in at 49 versus a forecasted 47.7, suggesting that more rate hikes could be in the cards.  For crypto, all this is happening as the industry enters October, historically one of its strongest months.  The crypto market, especially bitcoin, has seen a sizable rally recently, influenced by factors like the SEC's ether futures ETFs approvals and other government decisions, QCP Capital wrote in a recent note, highlighting that bitcoin has gained 15% in the last two weeks. However, QCP has concerns regarding the rally's sustainability, with shifts in demand and historical data suggesting potential market downturns.  “We would even go further to say a futures-only ETF is arguably detrimental to spot price - as it potentially directs demand away from the spot market into a synthetic market,” they wrote. QCP says it is taking advantage of this rally to buy the downside hedges, expecting resistance to hold around $29,000-$30,000.  As far as the recently launched ether futures ETFs, volumes remained low throughout the trading day.  ""Even if these ETFs come out, and they don't massively drive price changes, that's okay. That's what assets are supposed to do. They're not supposed to be all over the room,"" Dexterity Capital Managing Partner Michael Safai said on a recent appearance on CoinDesk TV.

Crypto Analyst Explains How,"As the largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC) has always dominated the headlines and drives the mainstream hype around cryptocurrencies. In terms of performance, it’s no news Ethereum (ETH) has followed behind BTC in the past few years. However, according to crypto analyst Dave the Wave, Ethereum could outperform Bitcoin in the coming years. A Different Perspective Dave the Wave took to social media to share his views on the Ethereum/Bitcoin price action. The current trajectory shows Ethereum has been falling against Bitcoin in terms of performance since the beginning of the year. Related Reading: IPO Frenzy: What Happens To XRP Price If Ripple Stock Climbs To $600? A more in-depth examination reveals that Ethereum has been following a pattern of lower highs and lower lows, which is indicative of a continued downward trend.

The longer time-frame trumps the shorter…. and helps to predict future price action, which is what speculation is all about, as opposed to simply describing recent past price… pic.twitter.com/kMrqN3istb — dave the wave🌊🌓 (@davthewave) September 29, 2023 A closer look into a multi-year timeframe shows a falling wedge has been forming in the Ethereum/Bitcoin pair’s performance since July of 2022. The current situation shows the formation of this wedge might be nearing its end which indicates a decrease in downside momentum and a potential trend reversal. This possible reversal is reiterated by the Fibonacci indicator, which shows the downward trend is at the 0.236 level. Can Ethereum Outperform Bitcoin? Ethereum has frequently outperformed Bitcoin for periods stretching months at a time. The ecosystem also has a few key advantages over BTX that could help it outperform in the coming years. Although Bitcoin still reigns as the top cryptocurrency, Ethereum seems poised to gain more mainstream traction in the coming years. As more projects and blockchains are built and connected to the Ethereum network, we could see Ethereum flip Bitcoin in terms of performance as early as next year.

Singapore's favorable investment landscape and growing foreign direct investment make it an ideal location for Coinbase to establish a crypto hub. Despite challenges with profitability, Coinbase is well-positioned to benefit from institutional adoption and is expected to perform well in the crypto industry. Thesis Summary Coinbase ( COIN ) is making headlines again, as it has just received a full business license to operate in Singapore. This is a huge move for the company, as Singapore has the capacity to attract a lot of international business, including institutional players. Hopes of a new bull market are flourishing again as Bitcoin (BTC-USD) breaks above $28,000, and we are also seeing some good moves in altcoins. Looking at where we stand in the Bitcoin cycle, this is the time to accumulate. If I had to guess, though, I think we could see one more low in Bitcoin and Coinbase before a real reversal. In my last article on Coinbase, I mentioned that the company was well-positioned to benefit from institutional adoption, and this move in Singapore supports that thesis. Furthermore, I warned investors they might be able to buy the dip at $70. COIN reversed at $69, and now is a good time to pull the trigger. Back In Business It's been a rough year for Crypto and Coinbase. Cryptocurrencies have come under regulatory scrutiny, prices have fallen, and so have Coinbase's revenues. But with all the bad news out of the way, it might now be time for the market to price in some good news, and that's what the market is doing today. Coinbase has obtained full regulatory approval in Singapore, which opens up the door to significant institutional investments. Where we see the (full license) also come into play is in helping us to accelerate relationships with stakeholders, particularly those that are regulated, such as banks. Source: Mr. Hassan Ahmed, director of Coinbase Singapore As mentioned by the company's director, this move brings Coinbase one step closer towards getting business from regulated institutions. Singapore could certainly become a new hub for crypto investment. The country is already very popular with international investors, thanks to its favourable investment landscape. Singapore FDI (Doing Business) As we can see, Foreign direct investment in Singapore has been growing at a fast pace, and that may be because Singapore scores so highly in transparency, responsibility, and shareholder power. This makes Singapore the ideal place for Coinbase to establish a worldwide crypto hub. The Big Picture Coinbase's business and stock price are highly correlated to that of Bitcoin and crypto. Looking at where we currently stand in the ""Bitcoin cycle"", this would seem like a great place to add. BTC cycle (TradingView) Bitcoin has tended to rally ahead of and following its halving cycles. The next halving is set to take place around March 2024. This means we should now be in a good accumulation phase. Ahead of the 2020 halving, Bitcoin rallied towards $10,000, only to collapse in value just ahead of the halving and then begin its rally towards $60,000. If this were to happen again, we might see Bitcoin retest lower levels, but I believe the low setback in December should hold. Technical Outlook In my last article, I proposed an Elliott Wave count for Coinbase, which has played out quite well so far. COIN TA (Author's work) Following a strong rally to over $100, Coinbase has now returned a little over 50%. This is to be expected in an Elliott Wave ii. COIN has made a strong reversal at the $70 level, and we have enough to consider this retracement to be done. With that said, we are now battling the 50-day MA. If we fail to break this, then another low could still be in play. There's a lot of support coming in at $65, which is the 61.8% retracement and where the 200-day MA lies. In my opinion, at $65, Coinbase would be an absolute gift to investors. Risks Despite my positive outlook, Coinbase will face some challenges moving forward. My biggest concern right now is that the company is struggling with profitability. COIN Adj EBITDA (Quarterly Report) On adjusted terms, the company was able to turn an EBITDA profit, but this was only after laying off a significant amount of employees and cutting down on costs aggressively. Current EPS estimates still have Coinbase not turning a profit until 2027. EPS estimates COIN (Seeking Alpha) Though I think these are overly pessimistic, the lack of profitability does raise concerns over the financial health of Coinbase and the possibility that the company will have to raise capital. Takeaway The crypto industry has become a challenging one this year, but to me, this means the players left could benefit even more. Coinbase is one of the few crypto exchanges that can actually bring institutional investors into the space, and as this plays out, I expect the company to do very well.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4638563-coinbase-institutional-money-may-start-pouring-in?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/18305589.jpeg

Some level of excitement has returned to the market. Meanwhile, DAUs are down and exchange supply has slightly increased since the beginning of September. On-chain metrics are giving competing signals from where I sit. If you're a long-term holder, $26k or $28k will make little difference two years from now. When I last covered Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) for Seeking Alpha in mid-June , Bitcoin had been benefiting from deep corrections in many of the alt-coins that have lost favor over the last two years or so. In the festival of risk that is the crypto market, Bitcoin can be looked at as the ""safe haven"" asset. With Bitcoin dominance still high, a block reward halving a little over 6 months away, and a dollar index that has rallied over 7% since the July lows, I think it's a good time to reassess the setup for BTC. In this update, we'll look at on-chain metrics, holder data, and the macro setup. Traders Running Wild? Data by YCharts As of the article submission, the price of BTC has pumped more than 15% in a matter of just a few weeks. After crossing under $25k in mid-September, Bitcoin is currently flirting with $28k and even hit $28.6k intraday on October 2nd. The question is why? 24hr Liquidations (CoinGlass) The simple answer might be speculator liquidations. In the last 24 hours, over $61 million in BTC bets have been liquidated, with $45 million of that coming from the short side. Still, I don't think some sort of short squeeze explains the big move higher in the last few sessions. BTC Open Interest (CoinGlass) While still well off the lows from earlier this year, there has been a slight decline in open interest peaks for Bitcoin over the last few months or so. After topping out at just under $15 billion OI in June, BTC options OI has generally stayed in the $9-10 billion range. On Chain Activity From a daily active user's standpoint, we sometimes see moves in the price of Bitcoin that correlate to real network usage. But from where I sit, that doesn't explain what we're seeing in Bitcoin's price to start the month of October, either. In fact, it's been the exact opposite: Bitcoin DAUs, 1 year trend (Token Terminal) At 280k, October 1st was actually the lowest level of daily active users on-chain in the last year per Token Terminal. It was even lower than the 287k DAU figure on May 7th in response to the fee spike due to Ordinals. Ordinals Inscriptions (Dune Analytics) Speaking of which, Ordinals activity has remained solid through the summer. There are currently over 35 million cumulative inscriptions through the Ordinals project. BTC Fees (IntoTheBlock) However, even with robust daily inscriptions via Ordinals, we have not seen NFT usage on Bitcoin generate a meaningful spike in transaction fees the way we did in early May. So this doesn't really explain the drop in usage either. Address Count and Exchange Flow Data Raw holder metrics can give a sense for how Bitcoin's network adoption is developing. While it's far from a perfect growth indicator given the certainty that Bitcoin holders often use multiple different addresses on-chain, the non-zero address figure reached a fresh all-time high of 49.8 million on September 23rd: Non zero addresses (CoinMetrics) Interestingly, since then we've seen a 1.7% decline in the number of non-zero BTC addresses down to 48.9 million. That figure is closer to where it was at the end of August, though still up a little over 12% year to date. Something else to consider however is the flow of BTC between holders and exchanges. BTC Exchange Balance (CoinGlass) Data from CoinGlass currently has a little over 1.82 million BTC on aggregated exchanges. The broad trend is still very much in decline. However, since the low at the end of August, there has been a noticeable uptick in BTC on exchange and a shift in where some of that BTC has been held: Ranking Exchanges Balance 24h Change 7d Change 30d Change 1 Binance 544,333.79 -4,572.05 -2,702.55 -14,183.62 2 Coinbase Pro 432,197.05 483.08 -1,536.48 -5,373.19 3 Bitfinex 373,373.79 2,400.24 4,070.01 1,145.17 4 OKX 123,511.89 860.13 -402.87 -858.4 5 Gemini 100,950.09 -99.7 987.63 3,766.08 6 bitFlyer 51,503.29 31.39 -54.81 -106.32 7 Kraken 48,682.46 297.52 2.78 -164 8 BitMEX 42,959.18 -103.65 -530.89 -804.37 9 Bybit 35,044.79 -702.8 -1,198.28 30,420.71 10 Bithumb 13,867.23 240.84 1,018.15 1,762.9 Source: CoinGlass, values in BTC as of 10/2/23 Binance ( BNB-USD ) has seen the biggest outflow of BTC by far, with over 14k BTC coming off exchange in the last 30 days. Most exchanges have seen negative supply net flow over the last month, with Bybit being one of the larger beneficiaries of positive net flow. It's generally viewed by many in the market that supply coming off exchange is bullish. This can be interpreted as a sign that holders aren't preparing to sell. Balance by time (IntoTheBlock) What is also telling is the holder balance by time data. IntoTheBlock considers funds that haven't moved for a year to be ""hodler"" funds. Importantly, funds that move around in a month or under are considered to be ""trader"" funds. At just 5%, traders currently have their lowest share of total BTC supply on record. This could be a sign that the market is gearing up for the halving. Macro & The Halving It is no secret at this point that Bitcoin's block reward will be cut in half from 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125 BTC per block in April 2024. This gives long-term Bitcoin holders a little over 6 months to front-run that event. For me, this is the most likely reason we're seeing declines in usage coupled with a spike in coin price. Miner Rewards (LookIntoBitcoin) As I've said in other Bitcoin and Bitcoin-proxy articles for Seeking Alpha, just because history tells us that BTC is usually higher 6 to 12 months following a halving, it doesn't mean it will happen that way again. We have a much different cost of credit environment than we've ever had during Bitcoin's history up to this point. FRED While I'm as surprised as just about anybody that the Federal Reserve hasn't pivoted yet on interest rates due to a multitude of reasons, the fact of the matter is the central bank has held firm so far. Bitcoin's 2020 post-halving bullish run came during the ZIRP era, but it should be noted that the 2017 bull run happened when Powell was raising rates during the last hiking cycle. Of course, those hikes weren't nearly as aggressive as the hikes we've seen in the last 16 months or so, but it's worth mentioning that there is history of BTC rallying while the Fed has raised. BTC hasn't done much since the Fed started hiking last year, but the coin is still well off lows. Summary For me, there are a lot of competing signals in this data. I think that's probably why Bitcoin hasn't been able to sustain a larger move in either direction outside of $26-28k in recent months. DAUs are down, exchange supply is flat to slightly up in recent weeks, and hodlers are eating supply share. Speculators have largely been getting rinsed in both directions in recent months. Is Bitcoin more attractive on October 2nd at $28k than it was just a few days before at $26k? I can't say yes. Ultimately, buying BTC comes down to your purpose for the purchase and your planned timeline for an exit. Long-term holders that DCA might be able to get a better price later this month. But I suspect 12 to 24 months from now, any buyer under $30k will be very pleased.",NEUTRAL,BTC | BNB,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4638562-bitcoin-breakout-fakeout?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/18305421.jpeg

A total of nine of the ETFs offering exposure to ether futures came to market on Monday. Five will hold only ether futures, while four will hold a mix of bitcoin and ether futures. One of those funds, Valkyrie’s Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF) – soon to be renamed – has been in existence for about two years as a bitcoin-only fund, but is changing its strategy to include ether. The rest of the vehicles are new to market.  “Pretty meh volume for the Ether Futures ETFs as a group,” said Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.  Among the more popular of the new ETFs today, VanEck’s Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) traded just shy of 25,000 shares at a price roughly averaging $17 per share for total dollar volume of just $425,000.  As comparison, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) – which launched in October 2021 amid a raging crypto bull market – traded more than $1 billion in in dollar volume on its first day.  The crypto industry continues to await a decision from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over numerous recent and older applications for both spot bitcoin and spot ether ETFs.

The defense wants clarity about whether it can argue that FTX, a big crypto exchange that collapsed last year, was not regulated in the U.S., though FTX.US did follow applicable rules, according to a Monday filing. Other questions include whether Bankman-Fried would be able to discuss the possibility that FTX creditors could secure massive recoveries in the exchange's ongoing bankruptcy case, and whether the one-time FTX executive can mention his charitable giving and philanthropy.  The defense also seemed concerned about the Department of Justice's plan to ""admit evidence concerning the alleged illegal campaign finance scheme.""  Judge Lewis Kaplan ruled in favor of the DOJ earlier this month when he granted prosecutors' motions to block Bankman-Fried from making certain arguments at trial. In the ruling he said that the defense did not object to those DOJ motions – statements the defense is now disputing.

Expert Analysis Says Yes,"Bitcoin prices could be bottoming, looking at price charts, and this might be one more opportunity for the savvy to accumulate before prices rip higher, according to one optimistic analyst. Taking to X, the analyst, Cryptocon_, said the “Ultimate Oscillator” indicator suggests that Bitcoin is at a “cyclical bottom,” adding that for the “first time,” the indicator has crossed into the cycle bottom zone in the two-week time frame. Bitcoin Likely Bottoming: Here’s Why Whether this prognosis is accurate depends on how Bitcoin prices pan out in the next few trading sessions. However, Bitcoin prices have since added roughly 4% since Cryptocon_ first laid out the analysis. Bitcoin is changing hands at around $28,000, up 12% from September lows. Following the sharp expansion on October 1 lifted BTC above September 2023 highs, a strong start for Q4 2023. The Ultimate Oscillator is a momentum indicator built on moving averages. Technically, the indicator is based on the idea that prices tend to close near the highs or lows of the recent trading range. Accordingly, based on Cryptocon_, Bitcoin is presently at “cyclical bottoms,” the same zone where BTC found support in the tail end of 2022 before bouncing off strongly in Q1 2023. Related Reading: XRP Price Bloodbath On The Horizon? Report Casts Doubt On Recent Rally If historical performance guides, Cryptocon_ believes “Bitcoin is offering traders one last accumulation opportunity,” but “most people will squander the pullback predicting and worrying about the macro.” Current macroeconomic conditions favor another round of interest rate hikes, especially in the United States. Although the Federal Reserve (Fed) kept rates unchanged in the last session, there are concerns that another hawkish environment could crash the crypto market like it did in 2022. Is BTC Heading Back To $32,000? At press time, Bitcoin is trading above August 29 highs in what appears to be a continuation of the bull run set in motion in late August. Still, it is unclear whether Bitcoin bulls have the momentum to push on. The daily trading chart shows that the coin is still trending inside the bear candlestick of August 17. The bar was wide-ranging with high trading volumes, cementing the bearish preview that continues to hold from the volume analysis perspective. Despite buyers expecting more gains in the sessions ahead, there must be a solid close above August 17 with rising trading volumes, completely reversing losses of mid-August. This move will likely cancel out the bearish preview that, as aforementioned, holds. This might set the ball rolling for a leg up to $30,000 and $32,000 in the sessions ahead.

18303478,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553795,1696276800,"Crypto Crisis Imminent, Warns Bloomberg’s Mike McGlone, Despite Bitcoin’s Surge To $28,000","On October 2, Mike McGlone, Commodity Strategist at Bloomberg, took to social media X (formerly known as Twitter) to express his concerns about the state of the crypto market. Despite Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent rise, McGlone highlighted a disturbing trend and raised the possibility of a cryptocurrency recession. Factors Behind Crypto Market’s Recession Risk McGlone pointed out the concept of “positive beta vs. negative liquidity” and its implications for the cryptocurrency market. Bloomberg’s senior Macro Strategist suggested that the weakness observed in the third quarter of 2023 could be either a temporary blip in the recovery or a sign of an impending recession. Related Reading: Optimism (OP) Climbs 6% A Day As Crypto Market Rebounds, What’s Next? According to McGlone, the latter scenario is more likely, given that most risk assets experienced gains in 2023 but have since rolled over into the new quarter. The strategist also drew attention to the actions of central banks worldwide, noting that many are tightening their monetary policies despite signs of contraction in the United States and Europe. Additionally, McGlone highlighted the ongoing property crisis in China, which carries deflationary implications. He argued that the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index’s (BGCI) relative underperformance may reflect changing conditions for an asset class that has thrived in a zero-interest-rate environment. Drawing historical parallels, McGlone mentioned the swoons in Bitcoin’s price preceding Federal Reserve (Fed) pivots, implying that cryptocurrencies could serve as leading indicators for broader market liquidity. McGlone suggested that a revival of liquidity may be necessary to support the crypto market. Bitcoin Maximalist Identifies Key Factors For Remarkable Market Growth In addition to McGlone’s forecast, increased regulatory scrutiny and implementing stringent regulations by governments and regulatory bodies can significantly impact the cryptocurrency market. The United States regulatory bodies have been actively cracking down on the crypto market, causing delays in what was expected to be a bullish run. Lawsuits filed in 2023 and signals of continued regulatory actions by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have created uncertainty and restrictive regulations that can dampen investor sentiment and contract the market. Moreover, economic factors contribute to concerns about a potential recession in the digital asset ecosystem. Cryptocurrencies are interconnected with the broader economic landscape, meaning global recessions, monetary policy changes, inflation, or deflation can affect the cryptocurrency market, potentially leading to a recession. On the other hand, some view the largest cryptocurrencies as safe havens during significant declines in the world’s largest economies. Bitcoin maximalists, including “The Bitcoin Therapist,” assisted by Artificial Intelligence (AI), have identified key factors necessary for Bitcoin and the overall market to achieve remarkable growth. These factors include mass adoption, global economic uncertainty, institutional investment, limited supply, increased transaction volume, technological improvements, regulatory clarity, positive market sentiment, halving events, and a global currency crisis. While progress has been made in factors such as global economic uncertainty, limited supply, increased transaction volume, technological improvements, and halving events, achieving mass adoption, institutional investment, regulatory clarity, positive market sentiment, and a global currency crisis are still pending. Related Reading: Chainlink Signal That Preceded Crashes Of 34% Is Back The strategist’s remarks underline the cautious sentiment surrounding cryptocurrencies despite recent positive movements in Bitcoin’s price. McGlone’s analysis suggests that the cryptocurrency market may face significant headwinds due to changing economic conditions, central bank policies, and potential liquidity challenges.

42419485,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEfS1,1696274842,Congress Can't Let Gary Gensler Regulate Digital Assets Out of Existence,"The advent of blockchain technology and digital assets offers an opportunity for the global economy not seen since the dawn of the internet. These innovations open doors for the unbanked, providing a pathway for success to those who are shut out of traditional financial systems.  Despite the boom in blockchain technology and digital assets, bureaucrats like Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler want to stifle their development in the United States through unlawful, overbearing regulations based on a misguided approach that lacks understanding of their potential. Thankfully, the courts have slapped down Gensler’s attempts to drive digital assets out of the U.S. economy. Now, Congress must act to ensure Gensler and the SEC are kept at bay.  Former Representatives Tim Ryan and David McIntosh are co-chairs of the Blockchain Innovation Project. Mr. Ryan served as a Democrat U.S. Representative from Ohio, and Mr. McIntosh served as a Republican U.S. representative from Indiana.  Gensler intends to take his authority to regulate “as far as [it] go[es]” while saving “transactions, products, and platforms from falling between the regulatory cracks,” according to his remarks at the 2021 Aspen Security Forum. In his latest attempt at unauthorized bureaucratic overreach, Gensler aims to regulate American digital asset firms out of existence.  Why is Gensler so against progress and innovation regarding digital assets? Because of the embarrassment associated with Gensler’s failure to prevent Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX from committing one of the largest fraud schemes in United States history.  U.S. Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-NY) labeled Gensler as “singularly responsible” for failing to expose Sam Bankman-Fried's fraudulent FTX cryptocurrency exchange in 2022. Gensler was asleep at the switch and failed to assert SEC oversight before it was too late in the FTX case. Now, Gensler’s solution is to punish law-abiding citizens within the industry due to a personal vendetta against one bad actor. As a result, Gensler is attempting to impose rules so drastic that digital asset firms leave America all together and move their operations overseas.  In his latest defeat, the federal appeals court for the District of Columbia ruled against the SEC in their attempt to prevent Grayscale Investments from turning their Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a listed Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). In the decision, Judge Neomi Reo directed Grayscale’s order to review be granted and the SEC’s order to deny the GBTC listing application to be vacated, citing that the SEC did not offer any explanation as to what Grayscale had done wrong. Despite this victory, there are no signs that Gensler and the SEC will retreat from their crusade.  Read more: David Z. Morris - The New Crypto Bill Gary Gensler Doesn’t Want You to Know About  Congress must act promptly to thwart any new burdensome regulatory attempts in the future. Thankfully, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer has taken the lead in these efforts to combat Gensler and the SEC by introducing an amendment to the Financial Services and General Government appropriations bill. If enacted, this rider would prohibit the SEC from using taxpayer dollars for illegal enforcement actions against digital assets without clear legal authority.  The importance of this rider cannot be overstated, and The Blockchain Innovation Project, a bipartisan advocacy organization designed to educate elected officials on digital assets and blockchain technology, supports the adoption of this rider. At a time when many Americans can hardly reach a consensus on anything, Republicans and Democrats can agree that the overbearing nature of Gensler’s SEC is unacceptable.  Digital assets are not going away. These assets offer Americans a unique opportunity to build wealth and grow our economy. If the SEC imposes crippling regulations on the industry domestically, the United States will fall behind our adversaries in the global marketplace. Individuals, not the government, should have the freedom to develop, grow and manage their own financial assets.

42419500,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEfMr,1696274611,Is Michael Lewis Throwing Out His Reputation to Defend Sam Bankman-Fried?,"You might be surprised to hear just how many people in crypto cite Michael Lewis, the former Wall St. bond slinger turned biggest living finance writer, as their favorite author. Many in the industry still wholeheartedly believe that crypto is something of a reformation event for the church of capital, a way to clear away decades of bureaucracy, become more personally involved in personal finances and align the world with the professed ideals of redistribution, inclusion and equality. And many see Lewis as an Abrahamic figure because of his role exposing the rot at the center of modern finance most notably through “The Big Short,” the 2008 best seller adopted by director Adam McKay for the big screen.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  ""Going Infinite"": The Controversial Interview  And so, if I tell you that Lewis has essentially become persona non grata within the world of crypto, it’s with a heavy heart. Almost overnight, Lewis’ reputation as the Virgil of Wall St., the financial crime writing extraordinaire, has tanked — all due to what can only be described as a profoundly ill-advised “60 Minutes” interview on Sunday, which served as the kickoff media event for his latest book “Going Infinite.” It was an appearance that all but solidified the idea that “Going Infinite” (Lewis’ 21st book), will be a hagiography of Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced founder of the now bankrupt crypto exchange, and one that raised serious questions about the veteran author’s role in this long nightmare.  We should caveat this with a few hugely important details: almost no one outside of publisher Norton or Lewis’ circle has read the book, which publishes tomorrow, coinciding with the start of Sam Bankman-Fried’s trial, where the fallen magnate is set to plead not guilty to multiple counts of fraud. It’s also forgivable that Lewis, like most reporters with direct access to SBF, missed the red flags at FTX. Bankman-Fried was a media phenomenon, a self-made billionaire who stood for capitalism done right — represented by his political donations, charitable commitments and shabby attire (even if he didn’t exactly come from rags).  Things that now seem like obvious warning signs, like FTX’s meteoric growth and seemingly boundless spending, were part and parcel to the story everyone wanted to tell. As Lewis told “60 Minutes:” “You gotta remember, I knew nothing about him … All I knew was I was supposed to evaluate his character. And that 18 months earlier, he had nothing, now he had $22.5 billion dollars and was the richest person in the world under 30.” It was, as Lewis said, an “incredible story.""  See also: Sam Bankman-Fried Blames Everyone but Himself for FTX's Collapse | Opinion  But what Lewis has chosen to do with his firsthand account and access to the media is to muddy the waters. This is true whether or not Bankman-Fried is ultimately convicted. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, and Bankman-Fried certainly deserves his day in court, but there are matters of fact and lines that simply should not be blurred when writing or promoting non-fiction.  In the interview, Lewis claims “if there hadn't been a run on customer deposits [at FTX], they'd still be sitting there making tons of money,” a statement that completely misses the fact that crypto exchanges are not banks, are not supposed to lend or use customer deposits and are not “fractional reserve” institutions.  For a writer who built a career making convoluted financial fraud dead simple to miss something so fundamental is bizarre, to say the least. Whether or not FTX brought in revenue is not being litigated, and bringing it up is to — again — miss the gigantic fraud-shaped hole in FTX’s books (and it's an SBF talking point). It’s enough for a CoinDesk editor ask me, maybe rhetorically, whether Bankman-Fried “has something” on Lewis. There doesn’t have to be an embarrassing photo of Lewis, like, kissing a goat at a Bahamian rave, for this to be a question worth asking.  See also: Understanding How FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried's Trial May Play Out  In fact, on “60 Minutes,” Lewis notes that he essentially worked as an advisor for FTX, which raises the issue of potential conflicts of interest. To be fair, this was likely informal, and a result of Bankman-Fried’s boundless impropriety — Lewis reportedly met with the wunderkind more than a hundred times, speaking for countless hours over two years. But the idea that Lewis could be a “neutral observer” is shattered. Others have brought up the chance that Lewis may have been and could still be financially ensnared in the web of FTX corporate, a tangle of over 100 shell companies and subsidiaries.  Venture capitalist Nic Carter, for instance, flagged the partnership between the U.S. unit of FTX and IEX, an alternative stock exchange that Lewis profiled in the 2014 book “Flash Boys.” Fortune speculated the exchange tie-up could’ve been a way to bring more of the international FTX operation to the states through a backdoor. Before FTX bought a stake in IEX, they held multiple meetings with notorious crypto skeptic Gary Gensler, who heads the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Regulatory and financial oddities aside, it’s clear that Lewis was always destined to write something that’d spin FTX in the best possible light. Bloomberg investigative journalist Zeke Faux notes in his recent book “Number Go Up” how jarring it was to see his literary hero on stage at an FTX-hosted conference in the Bahamas more or less proclaiming the religiously unkempt Bankman-Fried as capitalism’s savior. In a sense, this is the most forgivable of Lewis’ perceived crimes against journalism. Bankman-Fried failed in his purported mission, but you can still admire the zeal (even if it was a front).  It’s one thing to present opinion as fact — like saying FTX would be a going concern if Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao didn’t trigger a panic run, or that SBF was simply making SO MUCH MONEY he didn’t notice an $8 billion hole in the balance sheet (afterall, Bankman-Fried at least privately admitted his hedge fund Alameda Research was unprofitable and illiquid). It’s another to want to see the best in people (or believe people could be good). “There is still a Sam-Bankman-Fried-shaped hole in the world that now needs filling,” Lewis said, referring to someone willing to take risks principally to benefit the world.  Effective altruism, Bankman-Fried’s professed motivation, in my opinion, is noble at a small scale and psychopathic when scaled up. Mosquito nets have been delivered, even if it sometimes seems like those in EA are mostly preoccupied with minimizing their taxes. Lewis seems to be an adherent, or at least sees John-Galt-but-charitable as a great protagonist. But life is not an Ayn Rand novel, and it seems like the writer has been tricked by a fabulist. The lowest point of the interview was when Lewis parroted the idea that customer funds went missing due to a criss-crossed banking situation to dispel the notion of outright theft.  See also: FTX Affiliate Alameda Research Loaned $4.1B to Employees  Considering the circumstances, it seems better to leave the possibility of fraud having been committed to the courts to determine. The best defense Bankman-Fried has is that he was profoundly oblivious and that FTX was for all intents and purposes, if not actually, criminally mismanaged (now that he can’t blame bad legal counsel). That Lewis seems willing to speak up for a perennially “misunderstood” man-child with few other public defenders is basically a gamble. What he’s wagering is a well-earned reputation.

So while Ripple has stated it has lost over $200 million in its fight against the US SEC, it seems that is not the only loss that has been incurred in the drawn-out battle. SEC Allegedly Damaged 75K XRP Followers John E. Deaton, a pro-XRP lawyer has taken to X (formerly Twitter) to publicly admonish the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its series of legal actions and enforcements against XRP, the native token of Ripple Labs. Related Reading: Crypto CEO Very Bullish On XRP Price, Sets Make Or Break Point Deaton has been a strong advocate for XRP since its fight against the US SEC began in 2020, and the cryptocurrency enthusiast and lawyer has actively participated in the community, airing out his views in defense of the cryptocurrency and its value as a global payment asset. In a recent post, Deaton stated that the US SEC has negatively affected thousands of XRP investors and users and these people have been protesting against the SEC’s actions toward the ecosystem for three years. “The SEC harmed a lot of innocent people in the process. 75K investors, users, developers, and small businesses have been screaming the above for 3 years,” Deaton stated. According to a civil filing, the SEC has destroyed more than $15 billion worth of assets owned by innocent holders of XRP who had acquired the token on secondary marketplaces. Ripple And SEC Legal Battle Developments RealClearPolicy (RCPC), an American policy website, recently published an article titled “The SEC is not King” on Thursday, September 30. In an X repost, Deaton acknowledged the article which highlighted significant aspects of the Ripple and SEC legal case from when the regulatory body filed a lawsuit against the crypto firm earlier in 2020, alleging that Ripple was selling unregistered security offerings. Ripple had aggressively defended itself against the SEC and achieved a partial victory after Judge Analisa Torres ruled in favor of Ripple and rejected the SEC’s allegations that sales of XRP tokens on exchanges are security sales. In a possible attempt to salvage its reputation and also gain the upper hand against XRP, the SEC filed an interlocutory appeal to reevaluate the Judge’s ruling and its case against the token. In light of this, Deaton published a blog post titled “The Irony of Interlocutory Appeal” last week, castigating the SEC’s appeal scheme to potentially delay the litigation. Related Reading: XRP Price Threatened As Ripple Unlocks 1 Billion Coins The US SEC has also been struck by a blow that may put a dent in its case with XRP. The defense team of Ripple recently exposed a pile of internal SEC documents and secret positions about the token which could significantly undermine the SEC’s argument that XRP should be treated as a security. This recent development has thrown a curveball in the ongoing legal battle between the US SEC and XRP, raising questions about the SEC’s intentions for the crypto industry and its method of handling cryptocurrencies.

42419489,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEfXB,1696272008,Fed Report: Silvergate Bank Got Fatally Ensnared in Crypto While Examiners Shrugged,"Silvergate Bank transformed from a community lender to a high-flying crypto bank without its Federal Reserve examiners raising an alarm, according to a report from the Federal Reserve’s Office of Inspector General (OIG), allowing the bank to take risks that would turn fatal.  Arising from obscurity, Silvergate was a go-to bank for the digital assets sector that was treated with suspicion by larger, more traditional institutions. For a decade, the bank largely operated as a single-industry lender, and the OIG concluded that this change in course should have required a different type of registration that its government supervisors failed to demand. And there were several problems that Fed examiners were too slow to deal with as the bank headed toward its voluntary wind-down in March after last year’s crypto mayhem shattered its customers.  “Examiners should have taken more aggressive and decisive supervisory action to escalate several issues in light of the bank’s unchecked growth; its volatile funding and deposit concentrations; and its significant, pervasive, and persistent weaknesses in key control functions,” the report found.  Under the banking regulations, Silvergate should have filed an application with the Fed when it pivoted into full-time crypto, the OIG concluded. But the California bank’s examiners had decided that because it was still taking in deposits and making loans to its customers, Silvergate remained a standard commercial bank and was never pushed to set up new risk protections to match its overhauled strategy.  Silvergate’s problems also extended to its “ineffective” senior management that was beset by nepotism, according to the OIG, which issued its findings last week. The report didn’t detail the nepotism allegations, but former CEO Alan Lane had taken heavy criticism for employing multiple members of his family in senior roles.  “The bank’s corporate governance and risk management capabilities did not keep pace with the bank’s rapid growth, increasing complexity, and evolving risk profile,” the report concluded.  Its move to voluntarily liquidate means Silvergate didn’t technically fail, and no government intervention was required to pay back depositors.  The OIG made several internal recommendations for how Fed examiners should handle similar situations in the future, though, and the Federal Reserve Board of Governors has agreed to develop new and expanded guidance on rapidly growing banks that change their focus.

18300533,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553766,1696269635,"Bitcoin MPI Forms Death Cross, End of The Rally?","On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Miners’ Position Index (MPI) has formed a death cross recently, a sign that the asset’s rally may end. Bitcoin MPI Has Formed A Bearish Crossover Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the 365-day moving average (MA) of the BTC MPI has crossed above the 90-day recently. The “MPI” here refers to an indicator that measures the ratio between the miner outflows and the yearly MA. The “miner outflows” are the amounts these chain validators transfer out of their combined wallets. Generally, the miners take out their coins for selling purposes, so the miners outflows can measure how much dumping they are currently partaking in. Miner outflows are usually not that unusual, though, as this cohort has to constantly sell what they mine to pay off their running costs like electricity bills. What can be notable, however, is whether their selling deviates from the norm. Related Reading: Ethereum ETF: Valkyrie Halts Purchase Of ETH Futures Contracts The MPI provides us with information about precisely this since it compares the outflows against their 365-day MA. When the metric is greater than 0, the miners are selling more than the average for the past year, while negative values imply the opposite. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 90-day and 365-day MAs of the Bitcoin MPI over the last few years: The two MAs of the metric appear to have crossed the path of each other in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant The above graph shows that the 90-day MA Bitcoin MPI (colored in orange) has declined during the last few weeks. Recently, the metric crossed below the 365-day MA, consolidating sideways. Historically, the crosses of the two MAs of the BTC MPI have appeared to be significant for the cryptocurrency’s price. In the chart, the quant has highlighted the major crossovers that occurred during the last few years. Whenever the indicator’s 90-day MA has observed a cross above the 365-day MA, BTC has gone off to witness some bullish momentum. Such a cross preceded the April 2019 rally, the 2021 bull run, and the rally that started this January. On the other hand, the opposite type of cross has proven to be bearish for the asset’s value, as steep declines have followed it. Since this death cross has once again formed for Bitcoin recently, it may signal that this year’s rally has reached its conclusion. Related Reading: Chainlink Signal That Preceded Crashes Of 34% Is Back However, the crossover is still in the process of forming, meaning that the coming weeks may be important. If the 90-day MA can turn itself around quickly, then the death cross may not form, but if the metrics continue in their current trajectory, the bearish signal would be solidified. BTC Price Regardless of the death cross, Bitcoin has observed some sharp bullish momentum during the past 24 hours, as the asset has surged to the $28,300 level.

Here’s Who Else We’ll Hear From,"FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried goes on trial this week after the crypto exchange's collapse and alleged theft of billions.  Key witnesses include former colleagues and friends, notably Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang, who had deep ties to FTX and Alameda Research. Ellison, once romantically involved with Bankman-Fried, has insights into FTX's internal workings and admitted to misleading actions.  Other witnesses like Nishad Singh and Wang held significant roles at FTX and Alameda, and have pleaded guilty to related charges.  It’s been almost a year since the global crypto exchange FTX shattered and its founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried lost all credibility. This week, he will try to convince a jury of his peers that he deserves to be a free man again – but first, we’re going to hear from some of his closest friends.  The six-week trial will see prosecutors pore through testimonies, internal documents, emails and mountains of evidence certain to shed new light on the crypto exchange’s alleged theft of billions of dollars in customer funds. The most striking evidence could come from the prosecutors’ witnesses – those who Bankman-Fried once counted as his friends and allies.  Read More: The Latest News on the Sam Bankman-Fried Trial  Several of Bankman-Fried’s former colleagues and friends will testify against the one-time crypto mogul following plea deals they struck with the U.S. Department of Justice, including his former romantic partner Caroline Ellison and childhood friend Gary Wang, who were both deeply involved in the daily workings of both FTX and its quant-driven trading shop, Alameda Research. Another two individuals, who prosecutors have yet to publicly name, may testify if granted immunity, suggesting they may also be tied to the exchange. The DOJ also announced over the weekend that prosecutors intend to call former FTX customers from around the world and investors as witnesses during the trial.  Caroline Ellison  Caroline Ellison is among the most highly-anticipated witnesses expected to take the stand against Bankman-Fried. As the one-time head of Alameda Research – the crypto hedge fund tied to FTX – she can speak to the companies’ relationship and the amount of FTT it held, court documents indicate. Perhaps somewhat more salaciously, she also had a personal relationship with the FTX founder. She is said to be one of the few insiders who actually knew what was going on inside FTX.  Ellison, the child of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists, first met Bankman-Fried at their previous employer, the Wall Street-focused trading firm Jane Street. They reunited in October 2021 after Bankman-Fried convinced her to join his crypto company over a Bay Area coffee.  In a plea hearing shortly in December 2022, shortly after the collapse of FTX, Ellison admitted to knowingly misleading lenders and receiving “an unlimited line of credit without being required to post collateral” from FTX for her then-hedge fund Alameda Research, even though the company didn’t need the money.  Ellison pleaded guilty to fraud charges and signed a plea deal, sans criminal tax violations. Her insight into FTX and Alameda’s alleged comingling of customer funds could prove pivotal from the stand.  She is also thought to be the person that knows Bankman-Fried best on a personal level, given the nature of her romantic relationship with the former crypto mogul, which slowly fizzled out in February 2022, according her diary, which Bankman-Fried leaked to the New York Times in August.  In her diary, she wrote mostly about her feelings for Bankman-Fried and how going through multiple breakups with him was affecting her work at Alameda Research, which she wrote “felt too associated with [him] in a way that was painful.”  Though she didn’t mention anything about her living situation in her diary, it is known that Ellison, among other FTX employees, lived together with Bankman-Fried in a $40 million penthouse in Albany in the Bahamas.  This makes Ellison one of the few insiders who seemed to have been around Bankman-Fried 24/7, both professionally and romantically, which gives her a unique perspective to speak about the former FTX founder’s ethic as a businessman as well as his character on a personal level.  Nishad Singh  Nishad Singh was another early hire at Alameda Research, when the trading firm was still based in a Berkely, California apartment with only four other employees. Singh, who in his high school days was close with Bankman-Fried’s brother, served as director of engineering at Alameda and like Ellison, lived with Bankman-Fried in his 10-person luxury penthouse in the Bahamas. After a year and a half at Alameda, he began a new role as the head of engineering at the then-newly launched FTX derivatives exchange, where he had minimal supervision.  Read More: Who's Who in the FTX Inner Circle  Singh was reportedly one of three people who controlled the keys to FTX’s matching engine, the system that facilitated the exchange’s processing of buy and sell orders and allowed those with a key to move around funds in any way they wanted. He also had knowledge of the exchange lending customer funds to Alameda. Like Ellison, he pleaded guilty in February this year to six criminal charges, including fraud and conspiracy.  Gary Wang  Gary Wang is the co-founder of Alameda Research and FTX – and was Sam Bankman-Fried’s right hand. Wang served as chief technology officer for both firms and has been described as a critical player in the FTX saga.  Wang also knew Bankman-Fried on a personal level, from being his buddy at a math camp in high school to later sharing a dorm in college at MIT. He was also one of the 10 roommates at the Nassau penthouse Bankman-Fried resided in. The Commodities and Trading Commission (CFTC) alleged that Wang “allowed Alameda to maintain an essentially unlimited line of credit on FTX.”  In December 2022, together with Ellison, Wang pleaded guilty to charges related to FTX’s collapse.  Andria van der Merwe  Andria van der Merwe is an economist specializing in complex regulatory investigations of financial markets, according to her biography on consulting firm Compass Lexecon's website. As an expert in financial regulation and market risks, she may provide insight into how Bankman-Fried and his inner circle allegedly conspired to violate federal securities and commodities law. She may also attest to the impact of FTX's collapse on the broader financial markets.  Peter Easton  University of Notre Dame Professor Peter Easton will provide an overview of Alameda Research and FTX’s financials, including the Alameda balance sheet that set into motion the collapse of Bankman-Fried's multi-billion-dollar crypto empire, prosecutors said. His testimony will discuss how customer funds were held and whether balances in actual bank accounts matched balances in FTX’s internal ledgers.  Defense witnesses  Thomas Bishop  Tom Bishop, a corporate consultant, specializes in forensic investigations and accounting issues. His court disclosure does not reveal much about his planned testimony, except that he may offer insight into “calculations of financial figures and metrics"" for FTX and Alameda based on “publicly available documents and records…including, but not limited to, balance sheets for Alameda,"" according to court filings. Defense attorneys said they intended to call Bishop to rebut possible DOJ testimony if needed.  Brian Kim  Brian Kim, a data analytics and forensics expert, may speak to internal messaging between Bankman-Fried and his employees at FTX and its sister companies. If he is called to the stand, he may testify on “the content, metadata, and file paths associated with Slack data and Google documents,” that allegedly prove Bankman-Fried instructed his employees to destroy evidence of his companies' alleged fraud. That data would include “the fields [of documents and messages] listing the author, custodian(s), and viewer(s), as well as the content created, modified, viewed, saved, and/or deleted dates,"" court filings show. Like Bishop, if he is called to testify, his focus would be on rebutting DOJ testimony.  Joseph Pimbley  Joseph Pimbley, a financial consultant, is an expert in financial risk management. In his testimony, he may tell the jury that “FTX’s software infrastructure … had insufficiently  robust reporting and insufficient testing and quality assurance of data integrity and code,” that external users, like Bankman-Fried, could not have seen or easily uncovered, a court filing said. Defense attorneys said they intend to call him to counter testimony from Wang and Singh.  Andrew Di Wu  Andrew Di Wu, a professor of finance and technology at the University of Michigan, may provide the jury with an overview of how cryptocurrency exchanges, and the blockchain technologies that undergird them, operate. As part of his testimony, he may also explain to the court ""the unique complexities in operating centralized cryptocurrency exchanges, particularly those with cross-border operations…and the challenges in processing transactions in multiple fiat and cryptocurrencies,"" a court filing said.. The defense said Wu’s testimony could come in response to an FBI agent testifying for the prosecution.  Who aren’t we hearing from  As of Sept. 29, some key executives and other individuals closely tied to Bankman-Fried were not publicly named as possible witnesses, including a few key figures at FTX.  Sam Trabucco  Before Caroline Ellison took over as the sole CEO of Alameda Research, she shared the position with Sam Trabucco – who stepped down as co-CEO in August of 2022 after only a year in the position. He oversaw Alameda’s expansion beyond its initial business as a market maker for lower-volume crypto assets into riskier trades and led the firm to “huge” profits, he claimed in a post on X in 2021. Trabucco was not named as one of the executives aware that FTX sent customer funds to Alameda in a Wall Street Journal article last year.  Dan Friedberg  Daniel Friedberg was FTX’s chief compliance officer from March 2020 to November 2022. He’s previously been tied to an online poker website that was caught up in scandal in which an estimated $20 million of funds were misappropriated and where he reportedly told an ally to put the blame on an unnamed consultant to the company. He joined FTX after being a partner at Fenwick & West LLP, where he led the firm’s cryptocurrency division.  Last November, he reportedly provided details about FTX to federal prosecutors. Reuters reported that he “expect[ed] to be called as a government witness” in Bankman-Fried’s trial, though his name has not yet been confirmed. His attorney did not pick up when called for comment.  Ryan Salame  Ryan Salame, a co-CEO of FTX’s Bahamian subsidiary, FTX Digital Markets, became the fourth highest-ranking official within Bankman-Fried's inner circle to plead guilty to federal charges after accepting a plea deal this fall.  Under Bankman-Fried's direction, Salame made millions of dollars worth of illegal campaign donations to dozens of U.S. congress people, campaign finance records show. However, despite helping his former boss gain influence on Capitol Hill, Salame alleges he had no knowledge of the depths of FTX's financial troubles or its executives' alleged crimes.  Salame has reportedly handed over some documents relating to FTX's collapse to federal prosecutors, but according to the New York Times, he will not testify in court. A previous court filing said he would invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination if called to the stand.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | RESEARCH,"Helene Braun, Elizabeth Napolitano",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/02/sam-bankman-frieds-closest-friends-will-testify-against-him-heres-who-else-well-hear-from,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7487a6f8fd2c3c1138d0b10b0bb1d1134d910d6c-1145x644.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

18298673,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553801,1696265437,XRP Price Bloodbath On The Horizon? Report Casts Doubt On Recent Rally,"Over a billion dollars in liquidations sent the XRP price and the crypto market back from the dead and into local highs. However, new data suggests the rally might be short, pushing down the nascent sector into critical support. Related Reading: Tellor (TRB) Is Up 640% In 2023, Back To 2021 Highs Ahead of Bitcoin, XRP? As of this writing, the XRP price trades at $0.5 with a 4% profit in the last week. The cryptocurrency rallied in the previous 24 hours but has been retracing its steps over the past few hours, hinting at potential losses unless buyers step in and defend these levels. XRP Price Braces For Impact? According to the trading desk QCP Capital, the current rally in the crypto market coincides with seasonality. In the nascent sector, October is known as “Uptober” because major cryptocurrencies, including the XRP price, trend to the upside. In the past years, every Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP price rally began in October, making it the best month for the market, as seen in the chart below. However, the trading desk warned its followers on social media X about a potential reverse that could have negative effects on cryptocurrencies: However, we are not fully convinced by this move, and we think that BTC might test super key 25k support sometime in the final quarter of 2023 (…) This aggressive bounce has been due almost entirely to exogenous factors thus far and might not have the momentum to sustain. The trading desk believes these factors may lack the power to sustain the current price action. In addition, the narrative around approving an Ethereum future Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) in the US could set the stage for a bloodbath. Two years ago, when the price of Bitcoin reached its all-time high of $69,000, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved a BTC futures ETF. This event marked the crypto market’s top, making the current ETH future ETF an ominous event for XRP and the altcoin market. QCP Capital claims that the newly approved financial asset could increase selling pressure in the sector due to adding “synthetic coins” to the market. In other words, the ETH futures ETF creates a disbalance between the supply and demand forces in the sector. The firm added: We would even go further to say a futures-only ETF is arguably detrimental to spot price – as it potentially directs demand away from the spot market into a synthetic market. Good News In The Short Term For XRP The XRP price could benefit from the US government shutdown in the macro arena. The analysis shows that in the past 30 years, each US government shutdown preceded a bull run for the financial market. This is the only positive news for the cryptocurrency in the medium term. Related Reading: Ripple CTO Addresses Bitcoin Adviser’s Claims That XRP Is Centralized In the short term, XRP still has a chance to run back above $0.6; as for Bitcoin, the trading firm expects the $29,000 to $30,000 resistance to remain intact.

18297400,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553749,1696262435,XRP Price Disappoints: Crypto Analyst Reveals Why He Will No Longer Accumulate,"The sentiment around the XRP price has been mostly bullish lately with numerous predictions coming through for a potential rally. However, not everyone has joined the bull bandwagon after being disappointed by the XRP price performance. One analyst in particular has expressed its displeasure at XRP’s performance over the years, and as a result of this, the analyst wants to abandon the token. XRP Price Value Weakens One analyst who goes by CryptoCheck on the TradingView platform has put forward reasons for why he is no longer bullish on the XRP price. The analysis shows how XRP has underperformed the rest of the crypto market over the years, leading to the belief that the value of the token has weakened. Related Reading: IPO Frenzy: What Happens To XRP Price If Ripple Stock Climbs To $600? CryptoCheck points to the fact that XRP has been unable to reclaim its first and only all-time high even though Bitcoin and a lot of altcoins have been able to do the multiple times. The crypto trader refers to this price performance as unusual when compared to other assets in the industry. The analyst laments the inability of XRP to put on the same kind of performance as other coins over the years despite its value proposition as being a cryptocurrency for institutions. “Other coins have long surpassed their ATH’s. But XRP made one high, and never again. This speaks of weakness in terms of value. And that can no longer be ignored,” the analyst writes. Furthermore, CryptoCheck compares the token to the likes of Dogecoin (DOGE) which is widely known for having no value and being a meme coin. Nevertheless, DOGE has hit multiple all-time highs while the XRP price continues to lag behind. “The truth is, if I bought as much DOGE as I did XRP, my portfolio would have been up x100 compared to now,” CryptoCheck adds. Weak support and stronger resistance | Source: Tradingview.com Will No Longer Accumulate XRP The culmination of CryptoCheck’s analysis comes from the fact that he will no longer be buying the token. According to the crypto trader, he had been religiously buying XRP due to his strong belief and ideology about the value proposition of the token. However, the XRP price performance has been nothing to write home about. The analyst attributes this to low trading volume for the token and investors not being interested in buying the token. Also, CryptoCheck points to what he referred to as a “Pump and Dump” price action which has led to XRP constantly forming “weak support zones and strong resistance zones.” Related Reading: XRP Price Threatened As Ripple Unlocks 1 Billion Coins Additionally, he explains that the rising unpopularity of XRP translates to weak confidence. As such, investors who are already holding the tokens are looking for a good opportunity to sell and exit, especially short-term traders. As for the analyst, he explained that the next course of action was to sell. “I have decided I will no longer accumulate. Instead, as soon as the price reaches higher than what I bought for, I will be looking to sell my bags,” he revealed.

While data shows that the value of transactions in both China and Hong Kong have dropped over the last year because of Beijing's continued strict prohibition on crypto assets and a prolonged downturn in the crypto market, Chainalysis argues that the presence of large OTC markets – and their relative stability in the face of both regional and global decline – shows a certain degree of tolerance by Beijing to crypto.  “The increasingly close relationship between China and Hong Kong leads some to speculate that Hong Kong's growing status as a crypto hub may signal that the Chinese government is reversing course on digital assets, or at least becoming more open to crypto initiatives,” it said in its report.  Chainalysis said that Hong Kong dominates in large institutional crypto transactions compared to other Asian regions. Its data shows that 46.8% of Hong Kong's annual crypto trades were institutional transactions exceeding $10 million, while retail trades under $10,000 accounted for just 4% of the City’s volume, marginally below the global average of 4.7%  On the other hand, South Korea leans heavily on retail trading on centralized exchanges, with “professional” traders between $10,000 and $1 million in transaction volume making up 40% of volume.

42392446,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6lZt,1696261120,Yield Farming: What Is It and How Does It Work?,"Yield farming is one of the most popular yield-generating opportunities in the global DeFi markets, enabling you to potentially earn above-average yields by depositing crypto in yield farming protocols.  Read on to learn more about yield farming and how it works.  This is partner content sourced from Laura Shin’s Unchained and published by CoinDesk.  What Is Yield Farming?  Yield farming refers to depositing tokens into a liquidity pool on a DeFi protocol to earn rewards, typically paid out in the protocol’s governance token.  There are different ways to yield farm, but the most common involve depositing crypto assets in either a decentralized lending or trading pool to provide liquidity. In exchange for providing liquidity to these platforms, liquidity providers (LPs) earn a certain annual percentage yield (APY), which is usually paid out in real-time.  DeFi projects enable yield farming to incentivize the use of their platforms and reward their community for contributing liquidity, which is the lifeblood of most DeFi platforms.  How Does Yield Farming Work?  While the yield farming process varies from protocol to protocol, it generally involves liquidity providers, also called yield farmers, depositing tokens in a DeFi application. In exchange, they earn rewards paid out in the protocol’s token.  Yield farming rewards are expressed as APY. These tokens are locked in a smart contract, which programmatically rewards users with tokens as they fulfill certain conditions.  Generally, the yield farming process works as follows:  Choose a yield farming protocol. Let’s go with an automated market maker (AMM) like PancakeSwap for this example.  On the decentralized trading platform, you click on ‘Liquidity’ to access the section for liquidity providers.  Then, you choose which assets you would like to deposit in a liquidity pool. For example, you could deposit BNB and CAKE in the BNB/CAKE pool.  You deposit the two assets in the trading pool and receive an LP token.  You then take that LP token, go to ‘Farms,’ and deposit it in the BNB/CAKE yield farm to earn your yield farming rewards (in addition to the transaction fees you receive as your share of the liquidity pool).  Many DeFi protocols reward yield farmers with governance tokens, which can be used to vote on decisions related to that platform and can also be traded on exchanges.  Benefits and Risks of Yield Farming  Yield farming offers an opportunity for individuals to earn passive income. However, the potentially high returns also come with substantial risk. Let’s take a look at the benefits and risks of yield farming.  Benefits of Yield Farming  Passive income: Rather than just holding, users can put their holdings to work and earn rewards in the form of additional tokens and fee income without actively trading.  Liquidity provision: Yield farming enables efficient trading and reduces slippage on DEXs. By providing liquidity, users play a crucial role in the functioning of the DeFi ecosystem.  High yields: Some DeFi projects offer attractive yields that exceed traditional financial instruments. Depending on market conditions, users can potentially earn substantial returns on their capital.  Risks of Yield Farming  Impermanent loss: Impermanent loss primarily occurs in AMMs because of the mechanism used to maintain balanced liquidity between the tokens in the pool. If the prices of the tokens in the pool change significantly after you’ve provided liquidity, the platform’s automated system may rebalance the pool by buying more of the cheaper tokens and selling the more expensive ones. This rebalancing action can result in a loss for yield farmers.  Smart contract flaws: DeFi protocols are built on smart contracts. Hackers can exploit any bugs or vulnerabilities in the code, resulting in the loss of deposited funds.  Fluctuating rates: Yields change based on supply and demand dynamics, which makes it hard to predict the potential rewards in the future. For example, yields can collapse as more people supply assets.  Volatile prices: Cryptocurrency prices can be highly volatile, affecting the value of rewards and the assets you’ve deposited. if the token you are earning your rewards in drops significantly in value, all your profits could be eroded away.  Is Yield Farming Worth It?  While yield farming can be a lucrative way to earn yields in the crypto market, it is also one of the riskiest activities you can engage in.  Even if you are yield farming on reputable DeFi protocols, smart contract risk, and hacks could still lead to a complete loss of funds.  Moreover, your potential yield farming profits are highly dependent on the price of the protocol token you receive as your yield farming reward. Should the value of the protocol token drop, your yield farming returns could easily dwindle.  Finally, the yield you receive today may not be the yield you receive tomorrow. High yields tend to compress as more yield farmers start to move funds into a high-yielding farm, affecting your returns.  If you can stomach the risk, yield farming can be an exciting way to earn yield on your crypto. However, you should conduct your own research and never invest more than you can afford to lose.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Unchained,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/yield-farming-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-work,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2abe6169f89042c943136f0b6ebb09a0f7bb54bb-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The regulator declined to comment on individual firms like ByBit, Luno and PayPal halting certain services to comply with the new rules – but said it welcomed all efforts to comply.  Some foreign crypto firms have responded poorly to the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority's attempts to engage them about its upcoming promotions rules for the sector, officials at the regulator said during a Monday interview with CoinDesk.  The promotion rules requiring crypto firms to have appropriate warnings on websites and implement a 24-hour waiting period for new investors to confirm they want to enter into a contract with companies will take effect on Oct. 8. The regulator has also given firms the option of applying for a three-month extension to comply with the rules.  While the FCA has tried to engage crypto firms serving U.K. clients about the promotions regime, it's ""concerned about a lack of engagement from some unregulated overseas firms,” said Lucy Castledine, director of consumer investments at the regulator.  ""There are some [overseas firms] that have not engaged to the standard that we would expect and the provision of information back to us has been poor,” she added.  Conversely, crypto firms like ByBit, Luno and payments platform PayPal, who recently announced they were halting certain services to the U.K. market in order to comply with the rules, received a nod of approval from the watchdog.  “You will appreciate we can't comment on specific firms but what we can say is that, of course, where firms are making decisions to actually get to the standards we want to see, that's really positive,” said Matthew Long, director of payments and digital assets at the FCA.  Meanwhile, the regulator is prepared to monitor firms' compliance and has the ability to scan 100,000 websites on a daily basis, said Castledine.  When firms don't comply, “we will issue warnings against those particular firms. We also have the ability to issue takedown requests ... and we've been working with the other big online tech platforms to make sure that illegal promotions don't actually appear in the first place,” Castledine said, adding that companies like Google are working to ensure paid financial promotions comply with FCA rules.  Unauthorized ads or promotions could mean jail time, the FCA warned in February.  The regulator will also have powers against overseas companies serving U.K. clients without registering with the FCA, but how they will handle them will vary case by case Castledine added. The regulator submits information on non-compliant firms to global watchdogs like the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) to be added to alert lists, she said.  “That international response is quite key and quite critical for us and we're working very hard on those relationships,” Castledine said.

42392452,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6m4f,1696258901,How Spot Trading Works in Crypto,"Crypto spot trading provides traders with a way to trade and invest in digital assets. Especially new crypto traders prefer spot trading over margin or derivatives trading as it offers a simpler trading experience, and you actually own the digital assets you buy.  This guide will teach you about spot trading in crypto and how it works.  This is partner content sourced from Laura Shin’s Unchained and published by CoinDesk.  What is Spot Trading in Crypto?  Spot trading in crypto is the process of buying and selling digital currencies and tokens at current market prices. The goal is to buy at prevailing market prices and then sell at a higher market price to generate a trading profit.  Unlike margin or futures trading, where traders bet on the upward or downward movement of cryptocurrency prices, spot trading allows traders to buy and sell the actual cryptocurrencies, providing ownership to buyers.  Having said that, spot trading shouldn’t be confused with investing or HODLing, as the aim of a spot trader is to make gains in the short term by regularly buying and selling cryptocurrencies to capitalize on price movements.  How Spot Trading Works in Crypto  The simplest way to engage in spot trading is to use a centralized exchange (CEX) or a decentralized exchange (DEX) to place the trade. CEXs often come with a simpler experience than DEXs, which makes them appealing to beginners.  Spot trading allows you to buy cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), with your local currencies or trade across several cryptocurrency trading pairs.  To trade crypto on the spot market, choose an exchange and set up an account. For this example, we chose the centralized exchange, Luno.  You will then need to deposit fiat currency or transfer crypto from another wallet to the exchange. Then, choose the cryptocurrency pair you want to trade.  Select your preferred order type between market, limit, and stop limit. In this example, we are using the BTC/USDC trading pair.  Enter the amount you want to trade, and then click ‘buy’ crypto.  Finally, your buy order will be executed as soon as it matches with a sell order in the orderbook, and you will receive your BTC in your exchange account. Conversely, if you place a market order, your order will be filled within seconds, and the trade settles almost instantly.  Pros and Cons of Crypto Spot Trading  Crypto spot trading has several advantages and a few disadvantages.  Pros  Coin ownership: Spot trading enables you to own the digital assets you purchase, which you can use for various purposes, such as for collateral to borrow other crypto assets or earn interest in decentralized lending pools.  Simple to use: Spot trading is relatively straightforward, especially for those new to trading.  Less risky: It’s less risky than margin and futures trading, which means your losses are limited to the capital you put in.  More crypto options: Generally, there are more cryptocurrencies supported for spot trading than margin trading on cryptocurrency exchanges.  Cons  Limited gains: Spot trading doesn’t offer leverage, which means you need to use your funds, which can limit potential gains (but also losses).  Fees: Spot trading can involve various fees, including trading, withdrawal, and network fees for trading cryptocurrencies that can impact your overall profitability.  Crypto Spot Trading vs. Margin Trading: What’s the Difference?  The main difference between crypto spot trading and margin trading is that while you will need cash for spot trading, the latter allows you to borrow funds for your trades with the use of leverage.  But that’s not all. Here are some of the key differences between crypto spot trading and margin trading.  Spot crypto trading is an easy way to participate in cryptocurrency trading. However, like any other investment or trading approach, there are still risks involved, and you could potentially lose all of your capital. Finally, it’s important to research the cryptocurrency you are buying and only trade what you can afford to lose.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Unchained,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/how-spot-trading-works-in-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8c577c8acd771e99a74ffdaa662635d762885f99-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Chainlink 30-Day MVRV Ratio Recently Hit The 20% Mark As explained by an analyst in a post on X, the last two times the 30-day MVRV ratio broke above the 19% level, the price of LINK registered a sharp decline. The “Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio” is an indicator that measures the ratio between the Chainlink market cap and the realized cap. The “realized cap” here refers to the total amount of capital that holders of the cryptocurrency have invested into it. As the MVRV ratio compares the spot valuation (the market cap) with the amount that the investors bought the asset with, its value can provide hints about whether the holders as a whole are in profits or not. When the metric has a value greater than 1, it means that the market cap is more than the realized cap, and hence, the average investor is in profit right now. The more the holders get into profit, however, the more likely they become to sell, so high values of the MVRV ratio can suggest the asset is becoming overpriced and a correction may be due. Related Reading: This Bullish Combination Has Finally Formed For Bitcoin, Rally Ahead? On the other hand, values under the threshold suggest the cryptocurrency may be undervalued currently as the overall market is holding some net unrealized losses. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 30-day version of the Chainlink MVRV ratio, which looks at the profitability of only the investors who bought within the past month: The value of the metric seems to have sharply surged in recent days | Source: @ali_charts on X In the above graph, the value of the 30-day MVRV ratio is represented as a percentage relative to the break-even level. As is visible, this indicator has observed some sharp uptrend recently as Chainlink has enjoyed its rally. During this latest rapid growth, the metric had managed to hit a peak of 20%, which means that the market cap had become 20% more than the realized cap of the 30-day investors. The analyst has pointed out an interesting trend that LINK has followed during the past couple of years. It would appear that whenever the 30-day MVRV ratio has broken above the 19% mark, the cryptocurrency has followed up with a steep drawdown. This has happened two times in the period of the chart and coincidentally, Chainlink’s decline was about 34.5% in both of these instances (although the time the drawdown was spread out over was different in the two cases). Related Reading: Bitcoin Eyes Turnaround: Could A New All-Time High Be On The Horizon? Analyst Predicts Since the 30-day MVRV has once again surged above this apparently significant level, it’s possible that LINK may also register a similar drop in the coming days or weeks. LINK Price Chainlink has observed some sharp uptrend over the past month, as its price is currently trading just under the $8 level, having gone up almost 34% in the period. If the MVRV ratio is anything to go by, though, this impressive run may finally be coming to an end.

42392444,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6lUl,1696258358,What Is Ethereum Sharding? A Beginner’s Guide,"The Ethereum developer community has been keen to address the blockchain’s prevalent scalability challenges via development updates. Following the shift to proof of stake (PoS), the next scalability step is Ethereum sharding.  This is partner content sourced from Laura Shin’s Unchained and published by CoinDesk.  Read on as we define sharding, explain how it works on the Ethereum network, and highlight its importance.  What Is Sharding?  Sharding is a scaling solution aimed at improving the Ethereum network’s capacity and transaction speed.  The Ethereum “mainnet” is divided into smaller, interconnected networks called “shards.” Each shard processes its own transactions and smart contracts parallel to the others, significantly increasing the network’s throughput and helping to reduce gas fees.  Sharding also helps to decentralize the Ethereum network as it reduces the load on individual nodes by distributing the transaction load across many nodes.  How Does Ethereum Sharding Work?  Ethereum sharding starts with the division of the network into multiple sections. Each shard handles a set of nodes that process transactions. Consequently, the nodes in each shard process transactions that belong to that shard. The validators on each shard verify the transactions and maintain the state.  Allocation to a shard is random and requires validators to have a stake to participate. Under the proof of stake consensus mechanism, a validator stakes a certain amount of ETH for their participation.  The sharding technique departs from the current transaction processing format, where all nodes are involved in every transaction. Cross-shard communication prevents role duplication, with shards sharing information about their transactions.  Currently, full nodes take up plenty of space and continually increase in size as more users join the platform. Sharding reduces node sizes since users only need to store a part of Ethereum’s transactional information.  Benefits and Drawbacks of Sharding Ethereum  Sharding Ethereum presents various benefits and drawbacks. Here’s a look at the most significant ones.  Pros  Increased Efficiency & Scalability  Instead of a single chain processing transaction, sharding enables parallel processing, which increases the number of transactions. This will go a long way in rivaling Web2 transaction speeds. Payment systems such as MasterCard and Visa process up to 24,000 transactions per second (TPS), while Ethereum currently stands at 20-30 TPS.  Increased Participation  Sharding offers the opportunity to scale without compromising transaction security. Ultimately, people can validate transactions without specialized hardware or high electricity consumption.  Cons  Attack Vulnerabilities  With transaction processing broken down to the shards level, attackers could potentially target a single unit. If such an action were successful, the bad actors could share information on invalid transactions with other shards, potentially compromising the entire network’s security.  Centralization Concerns  The possibility of collusion arises with the splitting of nodes into smaller groups. Such collusion could potentially lead to a form of centralization that goes against the ethos of Web3.  However, danksharding is a possible solution to the challenge of ensuring diversity and randomness in the composition of the committee members.  Smart Contract Compatibility  Developers may need to modify their smart contract codes since not all may be compatible with sharding. For those already live on the network with no upgrade option, that may present a challenge in their execution due to the incompatibility.  Why Is Sharding Important?  Sharding offers a solution to the high gas fees and low transaction speeds that hinder the use of the Ethereum mainchain from mass adoption.  Overly optimistic projections suggest sharding could help hit 100,000 transactions per second. Such speeds would present Ethereum as a convenient payment infrastructure that could rival mainstream payment rails.  With the number of participating nodes increasing, the power distribution also increases (provided there’s no collusion). This would lead to increased security as a highly decentralized network lacks a single point of failure.  Successful sharding implementation could open up new use cases for Ethereum as more businesses could choose to embrace the fast and secure transactions the network could provide. However, the successful implementation of sharding relies on the Ethereum developer community identifying potential challenges and developing solutions.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH,Unchained,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-ethereum-sharding-a-beginners-guide,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e0a664a91664f590f30e4cda1c45ff20fc3d8182-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42392439,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6kzz,1696258092,What Are Crypto Trading Bots and How Do They Work?,"Cryptocurrency trading happens round-the-clock, making it challenging to seize all market opportunities, even for the most experienced traders. Therefore, experienced crypto traders often turn to crypto trading bots to compensate for these limitations, using algorithmic trading programs to auto-execute thier trading strategies on their behalf.  This is partner content sourced from Laura Shin’s Unchained and published by CoinDesk.  In this article, we explore crypto trading bots, how they work, their pros and cons, and some examples of popular crypto trading bots.  What Are Crypto Trading Bots  Crypto trading bots are automated algorithmic programs designed to use specific trading strategies based on predefined parameters to execute trading strategies in the global crypto asset markets.  Crypto trading bots can work 24/7 in the crypto market to compensate for the trader’s human limitation and achieve optimal trades.  The types of trading strategies algorithmic trading bots can execute vary from bot to bot, with some professional traders developing their own programs to capitalize on inefficiencies in the market.  How Do Crypto Trading Bots Work?  Cryptocurrency trading bots are automated trading software built by a third party. You can buy or subscribe to trading bot software or download a free bot trading program. However, you need to have at least some basic understanding of coding and technical analysis in most cases.  You use automated crypto trading bots by connecting them to exchanges using an Application Programming Interface (API). In crypto trading, an API is an interface that acts as a bridge between crypto trading bots and the exchange platform to allow bots to execute trades and manage the trader’s portfolio.  Crypto trading bots make trades based on simple or complex predefined market indicators and parameters. Some common parameters bots use include price, time frame, and order volume, while common market indicators include moving averages (MAs), relative strength index (RSI), and more.  However, you still need to choose the trading parameters and indicators carefully since they determine how the crypto trading bots monitor the market and make trade decisions. The bot executes trades once the market conditions align with your predetermined parameters.  Since automated crypto trading bots have direct access to your crypto assets and can make trades on your behalf, you must restrict your API on what actions bots can take and only use bots you trust. Moreover, you need to backtest your trading strategy under different market scenarios to increase the chances of it generating a profit in the live markets.  Advantages & Disadvantages of Using Crypto Trading Bots  There are a lot of benefits to using automated crypto trading bots, but this software also comes with a set of challenges. Let’s look at some advantages and disadvantages of using crypto trading bots.  Advantages of Using Crypto Trading Bots  Crypto trading bots offer efficient trading by automating the trading process. It helps traders keep track of all their digital assets and observe different markets simultaneously, removing the manual labor otherwise involved.  Crypto trading bots offer round-the-clock trading of the volatile crypto market. Traders are limited in monitoring the market 24/7 and might lose out on opportunities, which is where trading bots come in.  When set on the right parameters, crypto trading bots have better trading accuracy and market timing. The highly volatile market is all about finding the right time and digital currency to trade and gain profits.  Crypto trading bots eliminate human emotions in the trading process and make fewer mistakes if coded well. Traders are bound to be affected by some emotions when making exchanges which can drastically affect their outcomes.  Disadvantages of Using Crypto Trading Bots  The trading bot needs to be running for it to trade, which means your computer should also be constantly running. There is always a risk of the computer going off or the bot failing to execute, so you still have to keep an eye on them.

42392442,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6lAF,1696257365,Crypto Arbitrage Trading: What Is It and How Does It Work?,"Arbitrage trading is a strategy used in financial markets where traders profit from small price discrepancies in an asset across different exchanges. The same strategy can also be applied to the crypto markets. This guide will help you understand what crypto arbitrage trading is, how it works, and the risks it entails.  This is partner content sourced from Laura Shin’s Unchained and published by CoinDesk.  What Is Crypto Arbitrage Trading?  Crypto arbitrage trading is a way to profit from price differences in a cryptocurrency trading pair across different markets or platforms.  Arbitrage traders aim to profit from the price differences by buying the cryptocurrency at a lower price in one market and simultaneously selling it at a higher price in another market.  Though this trading strategy started with traditional assets, it has become commonplace in the global crypto markets because cryptocurrencies are traded across several exchanges and countries worldwide. This makes cryptocurrencies potentially lucrative for arbitrage and allows traders to benefit from price discrepancies across these exchanges.  Imagine that BTC/USD is trading at $30,000/30,100 on Coinbase and at $30,200/$30,300 on Crypto.com. An arbitrage trader could quickly buy 1 BTC on the Coinbase exchange for $30,100 and simultaneously sell it on Crypto.com for $31,200, making a profit of $100.  How Does Crypto Arbitrage Trading Work?  Crypto arbitrage trading involves making money from price differences of cryptocurrencies between different exchanges. Traders or, more commonly, algorithmic crypto trading bots monitor the prices of cryptocurrencies across various platforms and regions, seeking instances where the same cryptocurrency is priced differently on other exchanges.  When such a price gap is identified, traders move swiftly to gain on the opportunity.  Arbitrage trading is possible because of how exchanges determine cryptocurrency pairs’ prices. The common way prices are discovered on most exchanges is through an order book, which lists buy and sell orders for a specific crypto asset. Depending on the exchange, buyers and sellers might bid different prices, resulting in mismatched prevailing prices across exchanges.  An arbitrage opportunity arises when a significant price difference is detected for a specific cryptocurrency. You can then calculate the potential profit by considering trading fees and other associated costs. The last step in the process is to buy the cryptocurrency on the exchange where the price is lower and simultaneously sell on the exchange where the price is higher. In most cases, trading bots take care of this trading approach as they can determine arbitrate opportunities faster and execute trades quicker.  Types of Crypto Arbitrage Strategies  There are different types of strategies used in crypto arbitrage trading. Let’s take a look at some of the most common.  Triangular arbitrage: This strategy involves exploiting price discrepancies among three different cryptocurrencies traded in a triangular formation. For example, if there’s an arbitrage opportunity between BTC, ETH, and LTC, a trader could execute a series of trades to profit from the imbalances in their exchange rates.  Cross-exchange arbitrage: This method involves simultaneously buying and selling the same cryptocurrency on different exchanges. This can include moving assets between exchanges to take advantage of price differences.  Time arbitrage: It involves monitoring the same cryptocurrency on a single exchange to take advantage of price fluctuations within short timeframes. This strategy requires quick execution to capitalize on price movements in minutes.  Inter-exchange arbitrage: With this strategy, traders exploit price differences between trading pairs on the same exchange. Traders can identify correlated pairs and execute trades to capitalize on the mispricings.  Is Arbitrage Trading Risky?  Like any trading strategy, arbitrage trading also has risks. It’s possible to lose money due to slippage, trading fees, and unforeseen shocks in crypto price movements. Some of the risks to consider include:  Price Slippage: This is one of the most important considerations in arbitrage trading, particularly in fast-moving markets with high volatility. Slippage can lead to differences in the actual execution price and the expected price due to the rapid price changes between the time a trade is initiated and the time it is executed. If the price moves significantly between the moment a trader identifies an arbitrage opportunity and the moment the trade is executed, the expected profit might be smaller or result in a loss.  Transaction Fees: The accumulation of trading fees, withdrawal fees, and other overhead costs can impact the profitability of an arbitrage trade.  Execution Speed: Successful arbitrage trading relies on the quick execution of trades to capture price discrepancies. Delays in execution, whether due to technical glitches, slow internet connections, or exchange-related issues, can result in missed opportunities or losses.  Knowledge Gap: Like every trading strategy, successful arbitrage trading requires a deep understanding of the market and trading platforms. Without much experience, you might struggle to identify genuine opportunities or navigate the complexities of the process.  Arbitrage trading could be profitable with the proper understanding of how this strategy works and the right tool to execute it efficiently. But as always, do your own research and only deploy as much capital as you can afford to lose.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Unchained,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/crypto-arbitrage-trading-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-work,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c04ab4e6cfce3d8e6e918f42209bbfe91485b45f-1920x1325.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42392440,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6l57,1696256110,What Are Crypto Derivatives? A Beginner’s Guide,"Crypto derivatives have become an increasingly large part of the global crypto asset markets, enabling traders to speculate on price movement or hedge their market exposure.  Read on to learn what crypto derivatives are, what types there are, and how they work.  This is partner content sourced from Laura Shin’s Unchained and published by CoinDesk.  What Is a Crypto Derivatives Contract?  A cryptocurrency derivatives contract is a tradeable financial instrument that derives value from an underlying crypto asset, enabling traders to gain exposure to the asset’s price movement without actually owning it.  Crypto derivatives work like derivatives in traditional financial markets. Two parties enter a contract that specifies the conditions for the purchase or sale of the underlying asset, including the contract’s validity period, price, and quantity.  Cryptocurrency derivatives enable experienced digital asset traders to execute advancing trading strategies using leverage. They can also be used to hedge digital asset portfolios or a large long position in a particular crypto asset.  For example, a Bitcoin mining company may sell Bitcoin futures contracts to hedge its natural long position in BTC against a steep drop in the price of bitcoin.  Types of Crypto Derivatives  There are three main types of derivatives contracts in the crypto markets: futures, options, and perpetual swaps.  Futures  Futures are financial derivatives contracts where you have the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined date at an agreed price in the future.  Cryptocurrency futures enable you to go long or short a crypto asset using leverage, allowing you to speculate on future price developments or hedge market exposure.  Options  Options are derivative contract agreements where you receive the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a set price at a predetermined date in the future. The option buyer enjoys the right, but the option seller has an obligation to fulfill their part of the contract if the option holder so chooses.  Similarly to futures, you can use cryptocurrency options to speculate on price movements or hedge digital asset market exposure.  The key difference between the two is that options give you more flexibility than futures because you are not obliged to exercise the option. If your option isn’t “in the money,” you don’t have to exercise it and only lose the premium (i.e., the price) you paid for the option.  Perpetual Swaps  Perpetual swap contracts are financial derivatives that allow you to speculate on the price movement of crypto assets using leverage. But unlike traditional futures contracts, perpetual swaps don’t have expiration dates.  Perpetual swaps utilize a funding rate mechanism that helps ensure the contract’s price matches that of the underlying asset. The difference between the contract’s trading price and the underlying asset’s spot price determines the funding rate.  The structure keeps the demand for long and short positions balanced by offering incentives for the less popular market side. For example, if a perpetual swap’s price is higher than its underlying asset’s spot price, long position holders are charged the funding rate, which they pay to traders in the short position.  The funding rate system also ensures that the swap is anchored to its underlying asset.  Pros & Cons of Crypto Derivatives  Now let’s look at the benefits and drawbacks of cryptocurrency derivatives.  Pros  Leverage: Derivatives allow traders to enter larger positions than their capital would allow in the spot market.  Risk Mitigation: Crypto derivatives can be used to hedge digital asset market exposure, thus reducing market risk.  Ability to execute complex trading strategies: Cryptocurrency derivatives allow traders to deploy advancing trading strategies, such as betting on the volatility of the price of a crypto asset.  Cons  Leverage: While crypto derivatives traders can potentially benefit from using leverage to amply their potential trading profits, the leverage used can also amply losses. Given the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, losses can be significant if not adequately hedged.  Regulatory: Cryptocurrencies’ legal framework is inconsistent across jurisdictions and can present certain compliance and regulatory risks.  Counterparty Risks: In the over-the-counter (OTC) derivative market, traders face default credit risk. The due diligence and transaction security exchanges offer isn’t available for OTC derivatives trade.  As the global crypto markets continue to mature, the digital asset derivatives market grows with it. Perpetual swaps have become especially popular among crypto traders, but even the futures and options markets have seen continuous growth over the years, signaling that there is demand for derivative contracts in this nascent digital asset class.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING,Unchained,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-are-crypto-derivatives-a-beginners-guide,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/20bafd5c2b38151380adf480170e3fd5696502c8-1536x1024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42392453,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6luP,1696255475,What Are Multisig Wallets And How Do They Work?,"With security being a common concern among cryptocurrency users, multisig wallets are one of the most advanced security-enhancing tools available. Provided the keys are properly stored, multisig wallets can help eliminate the single point of failure that traditional single-key wallets face.  This is partner content sourced from Laura Shin’s Unchained and published by CoinDesk.  Read on to learn about multisig wallets, how they work, the various types available, and when to use them.  What Is a Multisig Wallet?  A multisignature wallet, also known as a multisig wallet, utilizes multiple private keys to access cryptocurrency assets or transfer them. The parties use smart contracts to determine the access rules when accessing the wallet.  With multisig wallets, you can enjoy a version of multi-factor authentication. This feature is especially relevant when the assets belong to multiple parties in a company or a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).  How Do Multisig Wallets Work?  Multisig wallets work by requiring two or more private keys to execute a transaction. Using a smart contract, the wallet owners agree to the access rules, including the minimum number of keys.  These wallets are a seedless form of self-custody since the owners govern them on-chain based on the rules established in the smart contract. Multisig wallets are a departure from traditional wallets that are user-controlled endpoints.  Types of Multisignature Wallets  The required number of keys for a transaction distinguishes the various types of multisig wallets.  1-of-2 Signatures  Two parties that trust each other can use this multisig wallet to share funds without requiring the authorization of the other.  2-of-3 Signatures  This is one of the most popular multisig wallets that requires two private keys to execute a transaction. The common practice is having one key online, another offline, and the third with a security company.  3-of-5 Signatures  The key holders store four keys in different offline locations, and the fifth remains with the wallet provider or a security company for improved security. Access to your crypto assets is possible if you can access two of the four offline keys.  All Private Keys Required  All three multisig wallet types above are threshold signature wallets. You can set the smart contract to require all private keys for access. If the predetermined number of signatories is five, all five keys are required to validate any transaction.  Pros & Cons of Multisig Wallets  There are several benefits associated with multisig wallets.  Adaptability: The wallet users can edit the multisig wallet’s smart contract anytime as needed.  Transparency: The smart contracts are open source, meaning anyone can audit the code to gain insight into the parties controlling the fund. In group settings, such as DAOs, can audit the smart contracts periodically to ensure the funds are secure and safe.  Key Person Risk Elimination: In one of the most famous examples of key person risk, QuadrigaCX lost over $104 million when the only person with access to the company’s private keys died. Multisig wallets ensure access is possible with the remaining keys even if one key becomes inaccessible. With exit scams plaguing the crypto industry, multisig wallets also minimize this risk since access requires the cooperation of multiple key holders.  Multisig wallets aren’t all rosy; there are some disadvantages as well.  Technical Knowledge: Setting up a multisig wallet requires understanding the various technical details to understand the option that best suits your needs. This might limit some potential users since they may lack the knowledge required.  Legal Ramifications: Conflict between the key holders can create a stalemate. Given that multiple parties control access, a legal determination of the parties with the legal right to access can be challenging.  Transaction Speed and Cost: Transactions involving multisig wallets combine multiple on-chain signatures, which can lead to a large transaction size. This can lead to higher gas fees and confirmation delays. Additionally, coordination between the key holders can take time.  Multisig Use Cases: When Does it Make Sense to Use Mutlisig?  Below are various instances where using multisig wallets comes in handy.  Escrow Protection  Escrow transactions between two parties can use 2-of-3 multisig wallets. With the two parties in agreement, the transaction proceeds without a hitch. In case of a dispute, the third party arbitrates and decides on the transaction direction.  Decentralized Finance  Trading, borrowing, and lending can occur through collective decision-making without involving intermediaries. A transaction can occur if there is a consensus among the minimum threshold of key holders.  Collaborative Ownership  In cases where parties collectively own crypto assets, multisig wallets make it easier to build trust among wallet users. Transactions involving shared assets can only occur when all parties agree on using the funds.  The crypto industry is marred with several fraud cases, making wallet security paramount. In addition, the rampant exit scams make collaboration and investment challenging. As the cryptocurrency landscape changes, multisig wallets provide an excellent option for cryptocurrency holders to maintain control of their assets and keep them secure.",POSITIVE,없음,REGULATION | TRADING,Unchained,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-are-multisig-wallets-and-how-do-they-work,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/46899fab50286e0a8ff9a1fa227986dfaacf80a7-5568x3712.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

18294449,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553739,1696255227,"Optimism (OP) Climbs 6% A Day As Crypto Market Rebounds, What’s Next?","Optimism (OP) has posted notable gains today, October 2, trading at $1.45, with a 5% increase in the last 24 hours. Furthermore, its price has gained 15% in the last seven days. OP’s rise coincides with the improvement in the general crypto market, which showed a remarkable recovery. However, whether OP will sustain the ongoing rally remains to be seen. But a close look at a few technical indicators may provide vital insights into its next price moves. OP Approaches Overbought Zone As Buyers Sustain Rally OP continues to show positive price momentum as buyers dominate the market. Also, it has formed a fifth consecutive candle on the daily chart, confirming active accumulation by traders. Its rally became prominent on September 29, when it broke above the Donchian Channel (DC) median band. OP flipped the $1.41 resistance level to support today and edges closer to the upper band of the Donchian Channel towards the $2.50 resistance level. If the buyers sustain the rally above the $1.50 resistance, OP will likely move into the overbought zone. Additionally, the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) has risen above its signal line, displaying a strong buy signal. Also, the Histogram bars are green, confirming that the buyers are still active. More so, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator displays a value of 64.2 and is rising to the overbought region of 70. Based on these indicators, OP will likely enter the overbought zone in the coming days, implying that accumulation will continue. However, traders should look out for bearish resistance at the $1.50 level that could serve as a potential entry point for sellers. What Could Be Behind OP’s Recent Gains? Besides the general recovery in the crypto market, Optimism records exciting developments in its ecosystem. One notable change is a September 29, 2023, proposal to change Optimism’s security model. According to the proposal, the OP team aims to hand over the admin key for the OP Mainnet to public and decentralized participants. These participants will be the Security Council held accountable for Optimism’s Governance. Although this proposal awaits approval, it creates engagement in the OP ecosystem, thus increasing investor interest and activity. And this increased activity exerts higher buy pressure on the token. Furthermore, the Optimism Superchain is another innovation driving ecosystem growth. According to blockchain data provider Covalent, the Superchain is an interlinked blockchain network of individual chains tagged “OP chains.” Interestingly, builders can use the Superchain to engage in on-chain development. However, they must comply with the Law of Chains, a set of community rules on how teams support public goods and decentralization. The OP Mainnet is the first member of the Superchain. Again, it has recorded increased daily active addresses, higher than Arbitrum, which is declining in on-chain activity. BuildOnBase, created by Coinbase, is the second member of the Superchain, aiming to attract billions of users. BuildOnBase ranked as one of the best-performing chains in 2023 and the fastest L2 to reach 100,000 users in 56 days. These developments are likely driving the growth in the Optimism ecosystem, evident in its recent price surge.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TRADING | ARB | OP,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/optimism-2/optimism-op-climbs-6-a-day-as-crypto-market-rebounds-whats-next/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/18294449.jpeg

42392447,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6lf1,1696255200,"Chainlink Unveils ‘Data Streams’ to Reduce Latency, Expands Decentralized Computing","Chainlink Data Streams has now entered early access on Arbitrum.  Chainlink also announced new decentralized computing capabilities with Functions Beta and Automation 2.0 on mainnet.  The products are designed to increase efficiency for users and reduce cost.  Chainlink, the blockchain data oracle provider, has launched “Data Streams,” a new product designed to reduce network latency.  The offering has now entered early access on layer 2 platform Arbitrum, the company said Monday in a press release.  Chainlink Data Streams combines low latency market data and automated execution “to unlock a new generation of ultra-fast and user-friendly derivatives products,"" according to the company. Low latency market data refers to financial market data that is delivered without delay.  The product uses a ""pull-based"" data oracle solution, where ”high frequency market data is continuously made available off-chain,” the press release said. Oracle reports are generated per block, and users can retrieve them off-chain and then validate with their on-chain transaction. This differs from the push-based solution where oracles proactively feed data to smart contracts at various time intervals.  Using a pull-based system reduces the latency – how much time it takes for a data packet to travel from one point to another – of updates. Latency is a common problem that afflicts distributed networks, since messages have to propagate to nodes, often causing delays in finalizing and synchronizing transactions.  “Data Streams not only enables DeFi (decentralized finance) protocols to support execution speeds and a user experience that rival centralized exchanges, but to do so without compromising on the core Web3 value of fair, transparent, and decentralized infrastructure,” Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov said in the release.  Also on Monday, the company announced new decentralized computing capabilities with Functions Beta and Automation 2.0 on the main network.  Chainlink Functions will enable developers to connect decentralized applications to any application programme interface (API), an intermediary layer which processes data transfers across systems.  Meanwhile, Chainlink Functions allows high value jobs to be automated at a tenth of the cost, saving up to 90% in gas costs, Chainlink said in the press release.  ""With all these new updates, we are creating a standard for how all developers can connect heterogenous Web3 components with any existing system they can think about, move data and value seamlessly across multiple chain ecosystem, and create new verifiable applications,"" Kemal El Moujahid, chief product officer at Chainlink Labs, said in a statement provided by a spokesperson.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin (BTC) rose above the $28,000 mark early Monday to log its highest price in over a month as analysts pointed to ETF optimism and seasonality among the reasons behind the gains. Traders at Japanese exchange Bitbank were already eyeing the $28,000 level for bitcoin last week, as CoinDesk reported. The $28,500 acted as a major support in the previous bull market and could be a key price to watch for in the coming weeks as it potentially flips into a level of resistance. In the past 24 hours, ether (ETH) bumped over $1,700, bnb (BNB) and cardano (ADA) added 3.3%, while polygon (MATIC) rose 5.5%. Solana’s SOL tokens led major gains at 14.5%, mainly on renewed optimism for the network among some traders.  It is officially trial week for FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. It’s been exactly nine months and 20 days since the former crypto CEO got arrested at his then-home in the Bahamas. On Tuesday, he is set to start the trial in which he will win back his freedom, or be locked up for what a federal judge says could be a “very long” time. Thousands of pages of evidence, ranging from internal documents to audio recordings, will be presented and fought over in the next six weeks as U.S. prosecutors try to prove that the former FTX founder knowingly defrauded customers and business partners. Arguably the most damning evidence – or lack thereof – could come from the recollections and personal opinions of Bankman-Fried’s former colleagues, friends and housemates.  Deus X Capital, a family office-backed investment firm, launched today with Tim Grant as CEO, the company said in a statement. The company begins with $1 billion of assets, including existing investments and capital to be deployed in private equity, venture capital and fund allocation opportunities in the digital asset, blockchain, fintech and institutional capital markets sectors. Grant was previously head of EMEA at Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital (GLXY.TO). Prior to this he was CEO of SIX Digital Exchange and worked at TradFi giant UBS. Stuart Connolly has been appointed chief investment officer, the firm said.

42392443,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6lKV,1696252800,Chia Network Lays Off Third of Its Staff as Loss of Banker Delayed Going Public,"Chia Network joins the steady trend of crypto firms cutting staff, saying its loss of banking partner Credit Suisse caused a costly delay of its effort to list as a public company.  The company said it got a new bank last week, but uncertainty remains about how long the Securities and Exchange Commission may take to review its request.  Chia Network cut more than a third of its workforce today as the blockchain platform sought to reestablish a lost banking relationship, the company told CoinDesk, further delaying what Chia had hoped would be a rapid path to listing as a public company.  The open-source software business, which had prided itself on seeking a U.S.-compliant route to establishing its listing on a U.S. exchange, informed 26 of its 70 employees today that their jobs were ending. That move comes five months after Chia, which was founded by BitTorrent inventor Bram Cohen, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to start its process to go public – a situation partially derailed by the collapse of its bank, Credit Suisse.  “Unfortunately, we’re going to lose some great people as we’ve endured a challenging funding environment over the past several months,” said Chia CEO Gene Hoffman, who said the layoffs are focused more on “ecosystem support” than sales and marketing. “It was a difficult decision to give the company the runway it needs.”  While the crypto company slashes its staff, it’s also looking to sell from its stockpile of its own token, XCH, Hoffman said. That mountain of 21 million XCH represents almost three quarters of the supply of those coins, with nearly 9 million in current circulation, but Hoffman said the company would only unload a limited amount as a backup source of funding on the runway to its initial public offering (IPO).  “Certainly, we’re not going to be selling even a material amount,” Hoffman told CoinDesk in an interview.  Under its structure, Chia has an unencumbered 2.6 million XCH it can easily unload, which would be worth $70 million at the current price, though that value would inevitably be affected by large-scale selling. After the news emerged, the price of XCH fell about 2.3% to $27.18 from the day's trading high.  Chia had never sold any of its tokens because of uncertainty over how the SEC would classify them, but Hoffman said recent court cases involving Ripple and Terraform Labs have demonstrated that a carefully decentralized token can satisfy current standards for defining a digital commodity.  On the IPO front, Hoffman said the company, which has been working with the World Bank and has tokenized carbon credits, secured a new banking relationship with a U.S. institution at the end of last week. He declined to identify the bank, citing the preliminary stage of the SEC negotiations.  Even with a new bank on board and reduced expenses, Chia faces an uncertain process with the regulator, which has been combating several other crypto firms in federal court.  While much of the industry is waging an open legal war with the agency, Chia has tried to walk a tightrope to meet U.S. regulators’ expectations. That puts the layer-one provider somewhere in the no-man’s-land between Prometheum Inc., a controversial startup seeking to establish itself as an SEC-approved trading firm, and most of the rest of the crypto industry that insists the regulators are making it impossible for digital assets businesses to comply.  “Our interaction with the SEC has been quite normal, which is saying something in this space,” Hoffman said, adding that it’s difficult to predict how long the process will take. “We've expected it's going to take a little longer than average to get through the SEC for somebody like us.”  The SEC had previously approved Coinbase Inc.’s effort to go public, though it eventually followed up with an enforcement action accusing it of violating securities law as an unregistered exchange.  The regulator may also run into its own delays as it faces a potential shutdown of the federal government caused by a congressional impasse over the U.S. budget. Chia’s filing would be in the hands of a “skeletal staff” if that happens, according to testimony this week from SEC Chair Gary Gensler.

42392454,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6mEv,1696252786,What Is GameFi and How Does It Work?,"GameFi presents an opportunity to earn crypto tokens while playing online games. Read on to learn about GameFi, why it is so popular, and you will discover a list of popular play-to-earn (P2E) games.  This is partner content sourced from Laura Shin’s Unchained and published by CoinDesk.  Introducing GameFi  GameFi, or game finance, combines online gaming and decentralized finance to achieve an in-game economy and convenience. It introduces the concept of play-to-earn (P2E), where in-game activity earns the player digital assets, rare items, and more.  Considering the already multi-billion-dollar industry is still growing, market forecasts predict it to rise to over $38B by 2028.  There is still a major chance that the industry will reach over $100B, contributing to the success of DeFi, NFTs, the metaverse, and more.  In most previously published video games, players could earn rewards. But still, they can only trade the most valuable skins everyone wishes to have. Additionally, they have little value outside the game’s virtual space. At the end of the day, centralized game publishers control who owns what, as these items are under their servers’ control.  However, blockchain technology and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have given sole ownership to players in GameFi. Furthermore, players can get remunerated for their time playing the games through in-game earning mechanisms that pay out in crypto tokens.  How Does GameFi Work?  While GameFi varies depending on specific projects, there are overall components that make it what it is.  The first is blockchain technology, which powers the games and the in-game tokens. Smart contracts also play a role, helping to decentralize much of the online gaming experience.  Additionally, decentralized finance, non-fungible tokens, and play-to-earn mechanisms help to make GameFi possible. Let’s look at these three aspects in a bit more details.  DeFi  DeFi contributes to the GameFi economy by creating opportunities like staking and liquidity provision. Considering GameFi initial DEX offerings, DeFi also plays a significant role in raising project funds. DeFi is also responsible for in-game rewards and incentives.  NFTs  To enable easier in-game item exchanges, NFTs come into play. They also facilitate digital asset ownership rights within the games. NFTs vary from avatars, costumes, weapons, land, and collectibles. The rarer the items, the more expensive you can expect them to be.  Marketplaces within the games help streamline this exchange and build an economic system in the game.  P2E  Earlier produced virtual games, especially massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) like World of Warcraft, required players to pay to play. However, the concept of GameFi is for players to engage with the game and earn rewards. These rewards could vary from tokens to rare collectibles. This can happen through completing levels, breeding in-game characters, developing virtual land, competing with other players, and more.  Other features that make GameFi work are gaming DAOs and community decision-making to help create a fairer environment for players.  Pros and Cons of GameFi  There are advantages and disadvantages to GameFi’s emergence.  Pros  P2E is an alternative to the traditional pay-to-play models of earlier video games. It gives way to more earning opportunities by simply engaging in blockchain games. Additionally, it also incentivizes more industry involvement, increasing its adoption.  NFTs are a way to promote virtual asset ownership without control by centralized entities. For many who have never seen the advantages of in-game items, NFTs are a way to maximize income and acquire valuable and rare collectibles.  Some traditional games prevent enthusiasts from selected places globally from playing. On the other hand, GameFi transcends borders and allows every user worldwide to engage with the ever-evolving industry. The opportunities promote financial inclusion and more knowledge concerning the tech industry.  Cons  Playing blockchain games may be challenging if someone does not have extensive knowledge about virtual games. This factor demands easier-to-navigate games from game developers.  NFTs and GameFi tokens are subject to fluctuating prices. In that case, you can incur GameFi losses during highly volatile periods.  GameFi has yet to have definitive regulations, which means there is a regulatory risk in playing blockchain games and earning and trading GameFi tokens.  Some projects in crypto are not always developed with the best interests at heart. The rising cases of scams, rug pulls, hacks, and more subject any crypto user to bad actors. This reason is another source of investment security worries.  Examples of Popular GameFi Platforms  Below are some popular GameFi platforms you can participate in.  Axie Infinity  Axie Infinity is among the most famous blockchain games in the industry today. It features creatures called Axies that you can collect, upgrade, and use for your Axie Infinity battles. Axie Infinity’s marketplace allows players to trade their Axies, with the most expensive ever sold at 300ETH. Axie Infinity mainly uses the AXS token to power the game, allocate rewards, and facilitate staking.  Illuvium  Illuvium, a long-awaited game before its launch, entered the industry in 2022. The autobattler describes itself as an Interoperable Blockchain Game (IBG) with P2E properties that encourage open-world adventures. To play, you are required to collect Illuvials and train them for better chances at battles. You can use its token, ILV, for in-game purchases and staking.  Gods Unchained  Gods Unchained is a card game on the Ethereum blockchain, promising complete ownership of the cards you acquire in the game. The tactical game requires you to beat your opponents through extensive calculation, not luck. The game depends on the GODS token for its in-game economy and voting rights. You can play to stack your deck, collect cards, sell/ buy them to/from other players, or achieve a higher status by accumulating the perfect deck.  It’s still early days for GameFi, with a handful of promising games that could potentially help bring the play-to-earn model to the mainstream. However, the distrust towards anything that looks like in-game purchases in the online gaming community will be a big hurdle to overcome for the GameFI movement before it can take off.",POSITIVE,AXS | ETH,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Unchained,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-gamefi-and-how-does-it-work,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7e0540d7ab04f140e56704cd8d3aed0b945fd977-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Based on his examination of the 1-day chart patterns of XRP, he suggests three primary phases for its future price – labeled as White, Blue, and Green. The ‘White’ phase, which Egrag claims has already concluded, saw XRP settle at $0.93. The ‘Blue’ phase, currently ongoing, aims for a target of $1.5. The ‘Green’ phase, which will begin after the completion of the ‘Blue’ phase, sets an ambitious target of $4.5. The Roadmap For XRP Price In The Coming Months Diving deeper into the analysis, Egrag believes that XRP exhibited a classic break-out, retest, and continuation pattern, suggesting a bullish trajectory. He further urges the crypto community, especially the XRP army, to remain steadfast as the price surge might catch many off guard. The analyst downplays any bearish forecasts for the upcoming months, hinting at their irrelevance. Related Reading: Crypto CEO Very Bullish On XRP Price, Sets Make Or Break Point A significant point from Egrag’s analysis is the formation of a “Mega Ascending Triangle” (Mega AT) in the XRP price chart. Should XRP close above $0.5207, its price might escalate to $1.40 quickly, surpassing its previous peak caused by Ripple’s legal victory against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Back then in mid-June, the cryptocurrency formed a “Mini Ascending Triangle” (Mini AT) and surged by nearly 100%, approaching $1. Egrag pinpoints the strong support zone between $0.4199 and $0.4803, with a key resistance range set between $0.5365 and $0.60. If XRP breaks this resistance, Egrag anticipates a significant move where $0.75 to $0.87 becomes the new supply zone. He emphasizes the $1 threshold as a critical structural and psychological barrier. Bypassing this mark paves the way for a rise to $1.40, marking the full realization of the “Mega AT”. However, the $4.5 target price, which represents a substantial hike, may take a more extended period to materialize. Egrag hints at the potential for a sudden market pump, even with minimal investment. He thinks, “the market is thin, small amount will pump the market.” However, Egrag adds: “No Timing, just showing the road.” He further advises: “Just wait and be patient.” Related Reading: Bitcoin, XRP Price Receive Boost Following This Coinbase Announcement At press time, XRP was trading at $0.52118, up slightly by 0.3% in the last 24 hours. XRP price bounced up from the 200EM in the 4-hour chart. However, the bulls had not been able to show enough buying force. The price failed to overcome the 23,6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.52778. This resistance is crucial for the price to rise to the 20-day high at $0.55768.

Speaking at the New York Fed Conference on Fintech: Artificial Intelligence and Digital Assets in Manhattan, Skingsley emphasized the need for central banks to embrace technological advancements, including cryptocurrencies and tokenization. Skingsley highlighted the distinctive approach of the BIS Innovation Hub, which focuses on researching and investigating the impact of new technologies on central bank operations. Unlike other institutions, the Innovation Hub actively engages with emerging technologies, including cryptocurrencies, and shares its findings with the global community. Skingsley expressed pride in the Innovation Hub’s project portfolio, which sets it apart from similar initiatives. Related Reading: Solana Rebound Potential: Is $30 The Next Target? In their most recent report titled “BIS Blueprint for the Future Monetary System,” BIS researchers underscored the significant potential of tokenization in enhancing efficiency and transparency within financial markets. However, the report also questioned the current value proposition of cryptocurrencies themselves. Tokenization’s Promise And Crypto’s Limitations The report acknowledged that cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance (DeFi) have provided a glimpse into the potential of tokenization. Still, it criticized cryptocurrencies as a flawed system that cannot assume the role of the future of money. Despite these reservations, Skingsley stressed the importance of central banks preparing for a tokenized future. “If the future is tokenized, if we’re going for a future where we will have tokenized assets on a broad scale, what would that mean for central banks?” Skingsley pondered. “What sort of infrastructure do you have to have?” Bitcoin performs better today at $28,332. Chart: TradingView.com SEC’s Role In Crypto Regulation In a related development, Paradigm, a prominent crypto investment firm, raised concerns about the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s approach to crypto regulation. Paradigm voiced its worries in an amicus brief filed in the SEC’s lawsuit against Binance, a major cryptocurrency exchange. Related Reading: Uniswap Soaring User Engagement: How It’s Transforming UNI Price? Paradigm’s brief highlighted the potential consequences of the SEC’s strict stance on crypto, warning that it could spill over into other asset markets beyond the SEC’s purview. The firm argued that the SEC’s interpretation of the securities laws could hinder the development of crypto technology in the United States and disrupt other significant markets. “Here, and in other cases, the SEC has acted in excess of its statutory authority,” Paradigm stated in its brief, emphasizing the importance of correct interpretation of the Securities Laws. As the financial world continues to grapple with the transformative impact of digital assets and tokenization, the calls for central banks to stay vigilant and adapt to this rapidly changing landscape grow louder. Skingsley’s message is clear: readiness is key in navigating the terrain of the digital future.

Marathon Digital management would rather dilute shareholders than hold to 2026 a cheap debt instrument. Tough times could be ahead for Marathon Digital due to the Bitcoin halving hence management elected to dilute existing shareholders to gain liquidity. Marathon Digital’s ( MARA ) stock has been quite the rollercoaster ride year to date. MARA stock price movement has been correlated with the price of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). Given the recent strong performance of Bitcoin in the past few weeks, it was no surprise to see MARA stock do well. Bitcoin started 2023 with a price of $16,670 and nearly doubled as it rallied to a high of $31,475. Bitcoin is currently trading at $27,003 as of writing for a 62% YTD return. Marathon Digital’s stock on the other hand had an even more blockbuster performance. MARA stock started 2023 at the price of $3.40 per share and has delivered a 150% return YTD as it is currently trading at $8.50. This gap is not unusual for mining/commodity companies, as typically asset price increases flow straight to the bottom line. However, due to the recent issues with Marathon Digital (and a lot of Bitcoin miners), I believe that there is a risk that MARA stock will underperform Bitcoin. Marathon Dilutes Shareholders It might be tempting to attribute the decline of MARA stock from its peak of $20 to the corresponding decline in Bitcoin’s price. While that may be the case, the recent dilution may continue to depress the share price. Data by YCharts Marathon Digital recently completed the exchange of its 1% Convertible Senior Notes. The company exchanged its $417 million worth of notes for 31.7 million new shares. This implies an actual conversion price of around $13 per share. According to the press release, the transaction represents a 21% discount to the bond's par value. While this is a good discount to get, I am not sure if this was the absolute best deal for the shareholders as I’ll discuss below. As you can imagine this is good news for the company as it suffers from liquidity issues. The company reduced its long-term convertible debt by around 56% leaving $331 million worth of debt remaining. The company is calculating savings of $101 million in cash savings from reduced interest expenses. There’s a lot of “happy talk” going on in the company’s press release but dilution generally hurts share prices in the short-term. The number of shares outstanding jumps from 174.3 million to 206 million, an increase of 18%. The company claims that this conversion would result in an accretion in shareholder value. However, this assumes that the company’s price will stay steady. New shares coming into the market in a bad macro environment have the tendency to be sold off though. So I think this might end up being an overhang on MARA stock price. Accretion analysis (Company Press Release) Reading Between the Lines There are a lot of things about this conversion that don’t make sense to me. Obviously, as I am not an insider in the company these are all conjectures and speculations I have based on pieces of publicly available information. The first thing that is confusing me is that as far as I know the notes were supposed to be due on 2026 which is still 3 years from now. The interest rates on these notes is also incredibly favorable at 1%. Based on the company’s Q2 2023 financial statements, Marathon Digital had an interest rate expense of $2.8 million in Q2 2023 and $6.6 million in YTD 2023. Now unfortunately we can’t calculate the traditional Interest Coverage ratio as the company has been operating at a loss. However, compared to Q2 2023 Revenue of $81.7 million and 2023 YTD revenue of $132.8 million, interest expense is a small driver of costs. Furthermore, had the company decided to wait until 2026 the holders of the debt would either get their principal back or convert at a much higher price. These debt notes were issued near the peak of the market in 2021. Because of this, it has a very high conversion rate of 13.127 shares per $1000 worth of principal implying a price of $76.17. It's unlikely that these debtholders would have converted though given that Marathon Digital’s share price is $8.50. They would have taken a substantial haircut if they did. So, the most likely scenario is that the principal amount would be needed to be repaid. If this is the situation that management wants to avoid, it is imperative to analyze why. In its press release, Marathon Digital management has weighed the refinancing option. However, they were fearful of the increase in interest rate expense due to having to refinance in a higher interest rate environment. Management also mentioned that its cash flows would have been burdened by this additional expense. Marathon Digital management would rather dilute shareholders than hold to 2026 a cheap debt instrument. Furthermore, it is this line in the press release that worries me, “the Company believes it is crucial to increase resilience and reduce its risk profile prior to the next Bitcoin halving event”. The next Bitcoin halving event is April 2024, only a few months from now. A “halving event” would increase the price of Bitcoin. However, it is detrimental to miners as it cuts in half the Bitcoin they are able to mine. So despite Marathon continuing to increase its operational hash rate, its efforts will be negated by this upcoming halving. Marathon hash rate (Investor Presentation) Conclusion It is my view that Management believes that tough times could be ahead for Marathon Digital hence they elected to dilute existing shareholders to gain liquidity. The company posted a loss of -$0.13 EPS missing both revenue and earnings analyst estimates. Marathon Digital’s EPS miss of -$0.13 was much lower than the average analyst estimate of -$0.08. The company had a cash burn from operating activities of $142.8 million in the six months of 2023. The company has a combined Cash and Bitcoin position of $445 Million. It also has, as of August 2023, an Installed Hash Rate (EH/s) of 23.1 and an Average Operational Hash Rate of 13.2. Despite these improvements, the company still sits on a knife’s edge when it comes to liquidity, especially given the circumstance of the Bitcoin halving in only a few months. I still believe in the long-term potential of Bitcoin but with Bitcoin ETFs coming soon there will be other options for investors. I believe that MARA stock is something that investors should avoid due to the myriad of issues facing the company.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4638431-marathon-digital-dilution-and-halving-better-to-just-own-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/18289439.jpeg

42392448,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6lk9,1696240800,Sam Bankman-Fried Goes on Trial Tomorrow,"It is officially trial week, everyone – or as Bloomberg’s Joe Weisenthal would likely put it, “this is why we get up in the morning.” It’s been exactly nine months and 20 days since Sam Bankman-Fried got arrested at his then-home in the Bahamas. Today marks the last day before he is set to start the trial in which he will win back his freedom – or be locked up for what a federal judge says could be a “very long” time.  You're reading The SBF Trial, a CoinDesk newsletter bringing you daily insights from inside the courtroom where Sam Bankman-Fried will try to stay out of prison. Want to receive it directly? Sign up here.  Thousands of pages of evidence, ranging from internal documents to audio recordings, will be presented and fought over in the next six weeks as U.S. prosecutors try to prove that the former FTX founder knowingly defrauded customers and business partners.  Arguably the most damning evidence – or lack thereof – could come from the recollections and personal opinions of Bankman-Fried’s former colleagues, friends and housemates.  Caroline Ellison, Nishad Singh and Gary Wang were close friends and roommates of Bankman-Fried as much as they were colleagues. Ellison was emotionally invested with the FTX founder and troubled by the former couple’s on-and-off relationship, which according to a diary entry from her, slowly fizzled out in February 2022.  Prosecutors also say they intend to call up FTX customers and investors, including non-U.S. customers, over the course of the trial.  On another note, do you remember when FTX suddenly announced it was hacked and lost some $600 million worth of crypto? This was the same day it filed for bankruptcy last November. A decent portion of those funds sat in a wallet for a few months – and then started moving this weekend. Around 15,000 ether (worth around $26 million at Sunday night’s prices) moved out of a wallet through various routers and privacy tools between Friday night and Sunday morning.  We never got an explanation for what, exactly, happened and how the exploit was carried out. I imagine federal investigators are probably closely tracking this episode, however.  On a logistics note, Judge Lewis Kaplan ruled in favor of the DOJ’s motion to prevent Bankman-Fried from getting into the weeds on what his lawyers may or may not have said about FTX’s operations in his opening statement. However, Bankman-Fried’s defense team can still raise the “advice-of-counsel” defense later on, with notice to the court and DOJ.  In court filings, the defense said the argument would be that FTX’s in-house and external lawyers were part of decisions to use auto-deleting messaging platforms, set up legal entities in the U.S., loan funds to FTX and Alameda executives and other aspects of the FTX/Alameda relationship.

18287824,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553723,1696239740,Solana Rebound Potential: Is $30 The Next Target?,"Solana (SOL) has been on an impressive winning streak, with its price chart resembling the formation of an inverted head and shoulders pattern, a bullish technical indicator signaling potential upward momentum. This surge in SOL’s value has grabbed the attention of crypto enthusiasts and traders alike. At the time of writing, SOL is trading at $24.39, according to CoinGecko. Over the past 24 hours, the coin has rallied by an impressive 14.5%, contributing to a seven-day surge of 25.4%. Notably, SOL recently breached the resistance level of $22.2, which now acts as a robust support zone in case of market pullbacks. Related Reading: Uniswap Soaring User Engagement: How It’s Transforming UNI Price? Solana: Potential For Further Gains Analysts are closely monitoring SOL’s ability to maintain its foothold above $22.1, as this could lead to another 13% price surge, with a target zone of $26 to $30. However, a word of caution is in order, as the presence of a long wick rejection around the $24 mark on the daily chart suggests the possibility of a minor pullback. SOL market cap nearing the $10 billion mark. Chart: TradingView.com In a separate report, it is noted that one SOL is currently trading at approximately 0.01281 ETH. This holds significant implications for traders and investors, particularly those closely following the SOL/ETH trading pair. This price point signifies an increase in volatility for Solana, potentially opening up more trading opportunities and the prospect of higher returns. Perhaps even more intriguingly, it highlights Solana’s growing dominance in certain aspects of blockchain technology when compared to Ethereum. SOL/ETH Trading Pair Signals Opportunity And Competition Ethereum has traditionally been the go-to platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. However, Solana has been making substantial headway due to its high throughput and lower transaction costs. A breakout in the SOL/ETH trading pair could signal that the market is increasingly recognizing Solana’s potential to rival, and even surpass, Ethereum in specific use cases. SOL seven-day price advance. Source: Coingecko Related Reading: CRV Price Surges 16% – What’s The Next Move For Curve DAO Token? The implications of SOL’s recent price surge and potential breakout against Ethereum are twofold. Firstly, it indicates a renewed interest and investment in Solana, potentially driving its market capitalization higher. Secondly, it raises the possibility of a more competitive landscape within the blockchain space, with Solana emerging as a serious contender in the world of decentralized applications and smart contracts. As crypto enthusiasts continue to watch these developments closely, the future holds exciting prospects for Solana and its investors.

Lewis’ account of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s rise and fall comes out Tuesday.  Crypto tycoon Sam Bankman-Fried saw billions of dollars in missing funds in his financial empire as a “rounding error,” biographer Michael Lewis told CBS’s 60 Minutes aired on Sunday.  As Bankman-Fried prepares to stand trial on fraud charges this week, Lewis, who has previously chronicled the Wall Street misdealings that led to the 2008 financial crisis, set out allegations of management failings at FTX – and a plot to pay off Donald Trump to stand down from his 2024 U.S. presidential ambitions.  The Department of Justice has accused Bankman-Fried of shifting customer funds from the FTX exchange to sister company Alameda Research, where they were used to fund his lavish lifestyle. Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty and appears to have downplayed the incident to Lewis.  Lewis said he asked Bankman-Fried how he was unaware “that $8 billion that’s not yours is in your private fund,” and received the reply that “when it went in there, it was a rounding error… it felt like we had infinity dollars in there… I wasn’t even thinking about it.”  Lewis also appeared to support allegations made by FTX’s new leadership, which took over on Nov. 11 when the company filed for bankruptcy, of poor corporate governance under Bankman-Fried’s tenure.  “Even his best friends, inside the company said, ‘Sam is just not built to manage people,’” Lewis said, adding that Bankman-Fried didn’t know the names of other members of the board of directors, and appears to have viewed their role as mere rubber-stamping.  Before FTX’s collapse, Bankman-Fried had also floated paying as much as $5 billion to Donald Trump to keep him from running for president again, added Lewis, whose book on Bankman-Fried comes out on Tuesday, the same day the fraud trial is scheduled to start.  Bankman-Fried “genuinely thinks he’s innocent,” added Lewis, who described FTX as a “great real business” that could have survived if bad publicity hadn’t led to a run on deposits.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/02/bankman-fried-saw-missing-ftx-billions-as-rounding-error-biographer-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/384d03e3c70c48bd6afc824b6cb8d2dd0f10dc53-1918x1079.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The SEC alleges the firm helped its clients – including 62 entities registered with the regulator – to break federal securities laws. It seeks an injunction against the auditor and wants it to pay fines and give up any profits made from illegal activity.  Prager Metis audited FTX's international arm and reported $1 billion in revenues in 2021, CoinDesk reported in November, on the same day that FTX filed for bankruptcy in the U.S. – with a $7 billion shortfall on its balance sheet. The company also had plans to open a location in the Metaverse. The SEC's complaint, however, isn't centered on the auditor's ties to FTX but on agreements the firm made with its numerous clients.  According to Friday's filing with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Prager Metis violated auditor independence standards by entering into agreements that included indemnification provisions – where clients agreed to release Prager from liabilities and costs from its services ""attributable to any knowing misrepresentations by management.""  The regulator also alleged the auditor was notified of these violations since at least January 2019.  “Auditor independence is critical to both protecting the integrity of financial reporting and promoting public trust. As alleged in our complaint, over a period of nearly three years, Prager’s audits, reviews, and exams fell short of these fundamental principles. Our complaint is an important reminder that auditor independence is crucial to investor protection,” Eric I. Bustillo, director of the SEC’s Miami regional office said in a press statement.

42392451,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6lzX,1696234677,"Bitcoin Surges Over $28K, but Analyst Questions ETF Optimism Angle","Bitcoin (BTC) rose above the $28,000 mark early Monday to log its highest prices in over a month as analysts pointed to ETF optimism and seasonality as a few reasons behind the gains.  Traders at Japanese exchange Bitbank were already eyeing the $28,000 level for bitcoin last week, as CoinDesk reported. The $28,500 acted as a major support level in the previous bull market and could be a key price level to watch for in the coming weeks as it potentially flips into a level of resistance.  In the past 24 hours, ether (ETH) bumped over $1,700, bnb (BNB) and cardano (ADA) added 3.3%, while polygon (MATIC) rose 5.5%. Solana’s SOL tokens led major gains at 14.5%, mainly on renewed optimism for the network among some traders.  Short liquidations on crypto-tracked futures may have contributed to the rise in bitcoin and ether. Data shows some $94 million in bets against rising prices were impacted on Sunday, creating a “short squeeze” – which occurs when there is a lack of supply and an excess of demand for the stock due to short sellers having to buy stocks to cover their short.  Some 30,000 bearish bets were liquidated, the data shows, with most liquidations taking place on the crypto exchange OKX.  Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader's initial margin. This happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position or fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open.  Elsewhere, some traders pointed to historic seasonality as a driver of Sunday’s gains.  “These gains in cryptocurrencies come with the bullish impression that characterizes the month of October in general,” shared Samer Hasn, markets analyst at XS.com.  “Bitcoin has not recorded monthly losses in October since 2013 except twice, which prompted this month to be called “Uptober” within the cryptocurrency community,” Hasn added.  ETF angle questioned  While some are attributing the rise in prices to optimism about crypto-related ETFs – after all a number of futures-based ether ETFs opened for business on Monday morning and Grayscale applied with the SEC to convert its $5 billion Ethereum Trust (ETHE) to a spot ETF – Dexterity Capital Managing Partner Michael Safai isn't so sure.  ""ETF issuers don't know the markets like traders do,"" he told CoinDesk TV. ""Their optimism is a bit misplaced; anyone who wants bitcoin or ether surely has it.""

18285204,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553688,1696233635,"Bitcoin Price Skyrockets Past $28,000, Here’s Why","The Bitcoin price trajectory has once again taken a sharp upward turn, marking its ascent past the $28,000 landmark for the first time since its notable surge on August 29. This prior leap had been attributed to Grayscale’s triumph over the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in their legal battle regarding the Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) conversion to a spot ETF. In a striking demonstration of Bitcoin’s infamous volatility, the BTC experienced a price escalation of over $800 within a minuscule 5-minute window on Sunday evening, rocketing from $27,250 to a peak of $28,053 between 6:15 and 6:20 pm ET. Why Is Bitcoin Price Up Today? One primary catalyst behind this dramatic price movement, as pinpointed by the esteemed crypto analyst Byzantine General, is the phenomenon known as a “short squeeze.” In the realm of futures trading, a short squeeze is characterized by a rapid price increase, forcing traders who had bet against the asset’s price (short sellers) to buy it to prevent further losses. This reactive buying can intensify the asset’s price jump. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To Reach $170,000 in 2025 – Mathematical Model Predicts During yesterday’s surge, a staggering $392 million in Bitcoin short positions, or about 7.7% of the total open interest in the market, were swiftly liquidated. Byzantine General further elaborated on the market’s resilience, observing that the Bitcoin open interest bounced back swiftly with an increment of $350 million, humorously suggesting the market’s willingness to embrace such a volatile maneuver again: “The whole market was actually like ‘I’ll fucking do it again.” Crypto analyst Fabian D. deepened the analysis by pointing out the intricate interplay between short sellers being ousted and the potential for further Bitcoin appreciation. He indicated that the upward trajectory of Bitcoin from this point hinges on two primary factors: the entry of spot buyers driven by the fear of missing out (FOMO) and whether short sellers decide to re-establish their positions. Fabian also alluded to the absence of institutional buying activity in the week preceding this surge but underscored the importance of monitoring premium rates on platforms like Coinbase and CME upon market opening today. Adding to the complexity of the market landscape, Fabian flagged two impending events: the anticipation surrounding the Ethereum Future ETF inflows, and the court hearing concerning the Celsius platform, which might potentially refocus attention on its creditor distributions. Drawing insights from on-chain data, analyst Maartunn introduced another layer of optimism, noting that “Net Taker Volume has crossed into the green zone, indicating that buyers are in control. The last time was four months ago.” Diving into granular analytics, quant trader Skew shed light on the dynamics at play on platforms like Binance and Bybit. He emphasized that the recent price upswing wasn’t entirely unforeseen, particularly given the noticeable shift away from short positions and the robust perpetual bid leading up to the spike. Related Reading: Bitcoin News: BTC Price Drops To $2,700 On Binance, CZ Explains Why Looking at the Bitcoin aggregate CVDs & delta, he further noted: “Mostly seeing sell pressure just in perps for now. Price decline with Perp CVD decline & Perp sell delta picking up. Next move that decides the fate of this entire move is spot.” Highlighting the evolving market dynamics, Skew pointed out that the BTC Binance Spot exhibited a notably broad order book with a significant amount of available and resting liquidity. He inferred that such a setup could lead to more pronounced price reactions. Highlighting the evolving market dynamics, Skew remarked that the BTC Binance spot market exhibits a notably broad order book with a significant amount of available and resting liquidity. He inferred that such a setup could lead to another pronounced price reaction. “Increasing ask liquidity on spot order books; implies greater volume needed by spot takers to clear $28K – $29K (Market structure shift),” he warned. It is also interesting to note that the price movement was already evident in the 1-day chart. As explained in the last Bitcoin price analyses, the price broke through the (black) downtrend line established in mid-July last Thursday. While the successful re-test of the trendline took place on Friday and Saturday, confirming the bullish momentum, the expected bounce occurred yesterday.

42409630,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcM7tn,1696232846,FTX 'Hacker' Moved 15K ETH This Weekend,"All 15,000 ether (ETH) sitting in a wallet associated with last year's $600 million attack on FTX's wallets have now moved through privacy tools and bridges.  In November 2022, hours after FTX and its related companies filed for bankruptcy, an unknown party managed to drain various wallets of as much as $600 million. About $26 million worth of ETH – 15,000 ether – sat in a single wallet until earlier this weekend, when a first tranche of 2,500 ETH ($4 million) began moving, ultimately ending up at the Thorchain bridge, the Railgun privacy wallet, or intermediary addresses.  The remainder of these funds have now moved, with many of them similarly landing up at the Thorchain router. Some of these funds also went to a contract labeled ""Metamask: Swap Router.""  Railgun is a privacy wallet that lets users store tokens and use funds for decentralized financial services, such as lending and borrowing. These transactions are shielded, meaning the exact use of such funds is not known. On the other hand, Thorchain is a bridge that lets users freely swap tokens between different blockchains without the fear of getting their transfers blocked.  As such, addresses associated with the exploit may have moved over $32 million worth of ether using THORChain, as per estimates.  The moving funds, coming soon before FTX founder and former chief executive Sam Bankman-Fried goes on trial, deepens one of the ongoing mysteries around the exchange's collapse last year. The identity of the party or parties behind the attack was never identified.  Read more: Millions in Ether Tied to FTX 'Hacker' on The Move  After the exploit, several addresses amassed various tokens, such as ETH and the dai (DAI) stablecoin, and swapped it all into 37,000 ether. The address held more than 288,000 ether at peak and was once the 35th-largest owner of the cryptocurrency, as previously reported.  Bankman-Fried was charged with two counts of wire fraud and five counts of conspiracy to commit various forms of fraud by federal prosecutors last year, weeks after stepping down from his role at FTX. He resigned the same day FTX filed for bankruptcy.
