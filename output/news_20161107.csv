42399463,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjDKa,1478560619,Overstock Invests in Blockchain Voting Startup SettleMint,"E-tail giant Overstock has invested in a Belgium-based blockchain startup.  The seed investment in SettleMint, the amount of which was not disclosed, was made by Medici Ventures, a venture arm of Overstock that is focused on its blockchain-based trading platform initiative. In April, Overstock invested $4m in Caribbean digital currency exchange Bitt, and the firm has stakes in other companies like PeerNova and Identity Mind as part of its crypto-exchange project.  According to the e-tailer, the investment in SettleMint is aimed, in part, at shoring up the voting capabilities for its tø platform. The startup recently unveiled a new voting tool geared toward this year's US presidential election.  Patrick Byrne, CEO of Overstock, said in a statement:  “Two years ago we identified six functions that will be fundamental to this new age, one of which was voting. Among SettleMint’s several great attractions to Medici Ventures’ capital has been their early work on blockchain voting. The immutability and universal accessibility of the blockchain make it the perfect technology for achieving higher confidence in the democratic process, for everyone.”  The proposed use of the technology to enable shareholder voting has gained steam in the past year, leading organizations like the EU Parliament's research outfit to propose using bitcoin as a basis for cataloging votes. Major proxy voting vendors like Broadridge have also begun working in this year.  The investment represents another step in the company’s ramp up to blockchain-based stock trading, as Overstock is planning to begin conducting an offering of its own stock via blockchain next month.  Earlier this week, announced a new partnership with Connecticut-based investment bank Source Capital Group, which will serve as dealer-manager for the offering. Overstock has also been investing heavily in the project, booking a $3m pretax loss in the third quarter of last year on its Medici business line.

42399448,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjD9l,1478557065,Bitcoin or Ether? College Teams Compete in $10k Crypto Investment Contest,"Students from 13 colleges worldwide are vying for a $10,000 first prize in a cryptocurrency investment contest.  Sponsored by digital currency exchange Kraken and curated by The Economist, the “Kraken Case Study Competition” sees teams aiming to craft what they believe is the most effective strategy for investing $1m in a digital currency portoflio. Participants must choose whether to stock their portfolios with bitcoin, ether (the cryptocurrency of the ethereum platform) or some combination of the two.  From there, they'll need to defend their choice, not just for the short-term but the long term as well – their portfolio, according to the rules, would need to sit for 5 years before any returns can be realized.  In order to win, the teams involved must make their case via video – the entries can already be seen online. Second and third place entries will take $5,000 and $3,000, respectively, with a People’s Choice award (along with a $3,000 cash prize) up for grabs following online voting.  Jesse Powell, CEO of Kraken, said in a statement:  “The teams must look at strengths and weaknesses of each technology and their use cases, adoption, project governance, developer and investor sentiment, historical performance and global regulatory issues. The complexity of this evaluation coupled with the tremendous upside potential for a correct bet is why we felt this was the perfect question for this challenge.""  Some of the schools involved in the contest include Rutgers Business School, John Hopkins Carey Business School and Worcester Polytechnic Institute, among others. Entry videos can be found here.  The winners are expected to be announced next month.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Kraken.

42399465,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjDMY,1478542368,Australian Travel Agency Tests Blockchain Bookings,"A hotel bookings company based in Australia has developed a blockchain proof-of-concept in partnership with Microsoft.  Using the tech giant’s Microsoft Azure platform as a basis, Webjet created what it described as a platform “to create shared, independent and trustworthy documents”.  The company is live testing its blockchain solution across several of the Web-based services it operates, with an eye to expand over the next year. According to the Australian Financial Review, the trials began six months ago.  The launch is notable given that Webjet began accepting bitcoin as a payment option in early 2015. Webjet is a public company which trades on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), a firm that has been experimenting with blockchain applications of its own. Other companies in the travel accommodations space, including Airbnb, have also moved to explore the tech.  For now, company execs say, the focus is on growing the scope of the pilot. John Guscic, managing director for Webjet, said in a statement:  “We realized facilitating bookings in the travel industry could become an additional business we could enter in the future, and the same technology could also help solve problems outside the travel industry.”  Representatives from Microsoft indicated that the core elements of the Webjet project could be applied elsewhere.  “By working with Webjet to use our digital platform, together we have created an innovative blockchain solution in Australia that has the potential to not only transform the travel industry but many other industries as well,” Mark Russinovich, Azure chief technology officer, said of the project.

42399449,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjDBj,1478528379,UK Regulator Adds 9 Blockchain Startups to Fintech 'Sandbox',"The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has unveiled a number of blockchain and digital currency projects to its regulatory ‘sandbox’ in a bid to promote product testing and consumer safety.  Nine blockchain startups (out of a total of 24) are involved in the fintech sandbox, a development which comes more than two years after the FCA first launched its financial tech-focused initiative ‘Project Innovate’. Within the sandbox, startups test new services and products under the supervision of regulators. The startups involved are Billon, BitX, Epiphyte, Govcoin Limited, Otonomos, Nivaura, SETL, Tradle and Tramonex.  FCA executive director of strategy and competition Christopher Woolard said in a statement:  “It has been an intense process for both firms and ourselves and we are grateful for their cooperation and hard work in getting us all to this position. We look forward to these businesses bringing new products and services to market whilst we ensure that appropriate consumer protection safeguards are in place.”  The news comes months after the FCA indicated an open stance toward the technology. Woolard argued during a speech in February that blockchain applications need “space” to grow.  Looking ahead, the FCA said it is beginning the process of adding more startups to its fintech sandbox. The agency will begin accepting applications one more later this month, with an eye to open those firms to sandbox testing by next May.

42399464,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjDLZ,1478525112,Digital Asset Targets World's Biggest Banks With New Blockchain Tech,"Digital Asset Holdings has revealed new blockchain technology it believes could one day connect the world's most important financial institutions.  Instead of a single ""full stack"" of its own applications, languages and execution capabilities, the company (headed by former JP Morgan executive Blythe Masters) is going for a more modular approach with its new Global Synchronization Log (GSL), revealed for the first time late last week.  Intended to serve as a foundation for independent distributed ledger implementations, GSL also aims to help other blockchain products focus on improving their smart contract services.  Digital Asset Holdings CTO Shaul Kfir went so far as to say the startup's goal is industry-wide standardization.  Kfir told CoinDesk:  ""Rather than a series of competing full-stack implementations, which each have to re-implement their own solutions to common problems, the GSL focuses on a very specific subsection of a platform so that it can be reused and combined with other components.""  Presented for the first time at a meeting of the Hyperledger open-source blockchain consortium, the white paper details how popular enterprise blockchain frameworks including Hyperledger's Fabric, R3CEV's Corda and CoinScience's MultiChain could each interface with the distributed log.  The benefits from such a ""wider collaboration,"" the paper argues, include more robust metrics about transactions and allowing other blockchains to focus on improving the quality of their own throughput and version management.  From the paper:  ""We believe this solution is suitable for systemically important financial institutions. We further believe that these components are reusable across many use cases, platforms and industries, which would all benefit from wider collaboration.""  Choosing a method  Presented in detail by Digital Asset's chief ledger architect, Tamas Blummer, the paper positions the GSL as aligned with Hyperledger's stated objective of becoming an ""umbrella"" organization that connects corporations.  To help ensure that happens, GSL was developed in response to demands Digital Asset encountered in its work with highly regulated global financial infrastructure providers, according to the paper. (That includes the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), which has invested at least $17m of Digital Asset's $60m raised to date).  The New York-based company identified five existing methods it said are currently being used elsewhere to protect user privacy. The first two of which — obfuscation and encryption, the paper argues, don't provide enough privacy for customers.  During the presentation, Blummer compared these two methods to those provided by the bitcoin blockchain, Hyperledger's Fabric and the new blockchain project, Zcash, the best-known blockchain to implement zero knowledge proofs.  While touted as a step forward in blockchain privacy, the Digital Asset team concluded Zcash's technology had not been tested enough in real-world applications. (The blockchain project officially went live last week).  With the remaining options left, the GSL combines segregated ledgers and data execution commitments.  The former, the paper defines as an interconnected network using ""common protocols or trusted intermediaries"" to move data from one place to another. The latter, being a ""network wide blockchain"" that ""carries fingerprints of sensitive data"" while the actual data is broken off and transmitted over private channels.  How it all comes together  The first function of the GSL is to ensure that ""mutually exclusive events"" are in fact unique. Or to put it another way, to ensure that smart contracts only exist in one place and that if an older contract is referenced by a newer contract, only the new one survives.  Notably, the paper does away with the term ""smart contract"" altogether, opting instead for the more traditional term ""contract.""  But in addition to ensuring duplicate contracts don't exist, the service works as a messaging system to inform all parties affected by a contract — perhaps thousands of them — that something has happened on the blockchain that they should know about.  To do this, the contract is processed off-chain. This could include processing ranging from flows of transactional data to common models of workflow behavior. While these contracts are designed to be code-enforced agreements which participants must follow they are not, for that matter, intended to be legally binding, according to the paper.  In fact, these contracts, taken together as a single collective state are how the paper defines the blockchain itself.  So long as these contracts remain capable of executing a command they will remain a part of the blockchain. But as soon as a new contract references the old one, it ""replaces or consumes"" the predecessor.  This process of replacing is similar to the contract version of ensuring there isn't a double-spend. Importantly, in light of the problems that led to the downfall of The DAO (which was unable to turn off its own self-executing smart contracts), unreferenced agreements can also be manually archived to make them inactive.  Transactions vs contracts  A transaction on the GSL results in a modification to the state by either activating or archiving a related smart contract.  To increase the sense of security, Digital Asset designed the GSL to make these modifications without having to ""understand or make transparent"" the content of the third-party’s message.  The end result of this separation could be an increased willingness of other potentially competing projects to integrate — if the benefits of doing so end up paying off.  From the paper:  ""At Digital Asset, we use our domain-specific language — DAML — to model and execute agreements between financial institutions with certainly and finality, but the GSL aims to support multiple implementations.""  One possible risk to Digital Asset's method is that transactions that occur on the GSL could be associated with events in the open market. The resulting correlation would amount to data leakage that could be captured by competitors or other observers.  To address this potentiality Digital Asset breaks down each of its transactions into two parts.  The first part is a Merkelized hash of the events with an accompanying notification sent to all parties impacted by the state change of a contract. ""Crucially, this shared secret cannot be understood by any other party,"" according to the paper.  These messages are designed to be easy to store, easy to recognize and cheap. That the transactions are light and affordable is considered essential for their final purpose, which according to the paper is to efficiently inform the thousands of potential parties that could be impacted by a change in a contract multiplied ""billions"" of potential contracts.  The second part of the transaction is opened specifically to auditors so they can check to ensure that contracts are only referred to once. This access, however, only gives them the ability to see the contract details they might need to do their job.  Regulatory involvement  In addition to sending messages to every party that agreed to the terms of a contract, the GSL software helps validate that the stream of information is updated and accurate.  To do this, Digital Asset allows networks running on the log to restrict which parties in a community of users can do which tasks. But, in order to ensure the overall network remains accurate, all parties involved have the ability to verify the transactions once they are made.  ""Thus, each participant behaves as a real-time auditor to the validity of commitments to the ledger as they pertain to the subset of the ledger visible to them,"" according to the paper.  In addition to the participants doubling as auditors in a similar way as happens in the bitcoin blockchain, regulators are also given special access.  Specifically, different types of regulators can be granted particular forms of access.  These forms might include a ""notification auditor"" who could insure all affected participants have been notified of a change to their contract and an auditor specifically empowered to make sure the current state of the blockchain directly follows from the previous state.  Next step  Digital Asset said it intetended for the white paper to now elicit feedback on the proposal from Hyperledger's members, with the meeting serving as a first step in the process.  Perhaps due to the fact the paper was provided shortly before the meeting, there was initial confusion as to the intent of the technology among participants, with one member questioning whether it was a competitor to R3's Corda.  Based on their current work and that feedback the company said it plans to release a series of other papers elaborating in greater technical detail exactly how the technology will work.  More importantly perhaps, the future papers will explain how the technology might be integrated — or not integrated — by the other Hyperledger members.  Kfir told CoinDesk:  ""We will be releasing a subsequent publication on the API that our GSL implements and look forward to collaborating with the Hyperledger community.""
