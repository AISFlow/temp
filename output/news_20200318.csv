42404227,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhdS2,1584567759,Payments Unicorn Square Gets Limited Bank Charter for Merchant Lending,"Square is launching a bank in 2021.      On Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Board (FDIC) gave the payments startup conditional approval for a bank charter to launch Square Financial Services, an Industrial Loan Company. Headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, the bank also received approval from the Utah Department of Financial institutions for the charter.      The bank’s primary business will be deposit products and small business loans for its commercial lending business. It plans to continue its business of selling loans to third-party investors, and Square doesn’t expect the bank to have a “material impact on Square's consolidated balance sheet in 2020.”      Square is led by bitcoin advocate and Silicon Valley mogul Jack Dorsey. Profits related to bitcoin made up half of Square’s Cash App revenue in the fourth quarter 2019, and the company is active in the crypto venture capital space, most recently funding Transparent Financial Systems, a startup developing a real-time “cryptographic settlement” network. But the bank has no plans to offer any features related to cryptocurrency, a Square spokesperson said.      Square’s banking services lead Lewis Goodwin will be the bank’s chief executive and the company’s finance lead will be its chief financial officer. Goodwin was previously president and CEO of Green Dot Bank, and has held senior banking roles at Toyota Savings Bank, Chrysler Financial Bank, and West One Bank.

42404249,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhdgn,1584567163,Dollar-Backed Stablecoins Are Holding Their Own Amid Coronavirus Chaos,"As the global equities markets continue along their uncertain path, most major stablecoins are holding up to the ""stable"" part of name amid the worst global pandemic since 1918.      Cryptocurrencies have fallen to historic lows with most major assets trending at the same prices seen nearly a year ago, erasing most of the bullish gains experienced throughout the last quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020.      In the broader markets, the ASX 200 fell 8.9 percent on Monday, its worst single-day loss since 1987, and is down 10.6 percent since the start of the week. U.S stocks also shared a similar fate, is off by 11.6 percent since Friday's close. Oil is down to its lowest point in nearly four years while gold, often praised as a safe-haven asset during economic uncertainty, is still trending significantly down from its March 9 peak of $1,703 to stand at $1,491 per troy ounce.      Read more: Stablecoins 'Flip' Ethereum's Native Currency in Transfer Value      What seems to be unflappable during the COVID-19 outbreak, however, are tokens known as stablecoins. Their values are generally pegged to fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar or the Chinese yuan and, more recently, exchange-traded commodities such as gold.      Stablecoins provide ease of access for traders and investors in the crypto markets and increase liquidity that would otherwise take hours or days to process via traditional payment rails going from fiat to crypto or vice versa.      According to CoinDesk Research data pulled from Messari, top U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins such as Paxos Standard (PAX), Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), Binance USD (BUSD) and TrueUSD (TUSD) have all retained their market capitalization º that is, they are trading at the value of their deposited assets º over the past seven days, shifting less than 0.25 percent.      ""With the significant level of 'risk-off' trading in every asset class, cash is again king, and in the crypto market the best representation of that is the more liquid USD [U.S. dollar] stablecoins,"" said Richard Galvin CEO at Digital Asset Capital Management based in Sydney, Australia.      ""Our view is sellers are either doing this with a view to buy back at lower points in the future or because these stablecoins are their best and/or only way to hold U.S. dollars,"" Galvin added.      Looking at the performance over March, the story remains the same amid the backdrop of one of the worst months in crypto's history. While most of the market has been down since March 13, the industry's top 5 stablecoins have barely shifted in value over a much larger timeframe.      Traditional assets have been taking a hit and major cryptos such as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) have experienced huge bouts of volatility and declines in value but stablecoins are looking more like a safe haven for those who want to remain in the market without exposing themselves to too much risk.

42404237,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhdZu,1584563760,Hawaii Hints It May Relax Onerous Rule to Lure Crypto Firms,"Hawaiian regulators have launched a digital currency sandbox initiative that exempts participating crypto companies from Hawaii’s infamous double-reserve requirement.      The “Digital Currency Innovation Lab” by Hawaii’s Department of Commerce, Division of Financial Institutions (DFI), and the Hawaii Technology Development Corporation (HTDC) will give “selected” firms a two-year reprieve from Hawaii’s state money transmitter license requirement, according to a press release shared Tuesday, as the state begins to develop new cryptocurrency legislation.      It may also mark the beginning of the end for perhaps the most restrictive state-level crypto licensing regimes left in the U.S.      DFI never banned crypto businesses from Hawaii. But when the regulator decided in 2017 that companies hold just as much fiat as their clients held crypto – the “double-reserve” requirement – previously licensed crypto companies, including Coinbase, fled the state arguing that the mandate was irrational, untenable and bad for consumers.      DFI now appears to recognize that its bar was too high. In the sandbox initiative's FAQ, HTDC writes that DFI “wanted to address the concerns” of businesses who could not meet the regulatory requirements.      A DFI spokesman confirmed that the sandbox does away with the double reserve requirement.      DFI pledged not to take action against sandbox participants, the press release said.      “DFI is leveraging its statutory authority to provide an innovative way to introduce digital currency issuers into the State of Hawaii, while ensuring the safety of our consumers,” Iris Ikeda, Commissioner of Financial Institutions, said in the press release.      Ikeda further stated that the sandbox would allow regulators to “craft legislation that is conducive to [cryptocurrencies] development in Hawaii.”      Hawaii’s sandbox is not a regulatory free-for-all, according to the press release.

42404242,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhddq,1584563252,"Data Sets You Free: Self-Quarantine Diary, Day 3","Michael J. Casey is CoinDesk's chief content officer. The views expressed here are his own.      Due to a prior medical condition that puts me at higher risk, I made a decision to ride out this coronavirus crisis in my bedroom, physically separated from my family and others. I started writing a daily diary to reflect on what all this means. The first post, laying out my (possibly flawed) reasoning, is here. The second, here. This is the third, addressing a positive change in circumstances. I welcome comments. We’re all figuring this out together.      Well, I am definitely no Nelson Mandela.      Apologies to anyone placing bets on my having to do this for the long haul, but my “solitary confinement” has ended. (Not this daily diary, though).      I’m downgrading from extreme social distancing to the regular standard that I hope most of you continue to apply. I’ve hugged my kids and kissed my wife.      Why the abrupt end to my social self-denial after just two days? Quite simply, I finally got the two pieces of information I needed: trusted medical opinions and test results.      They both came back negative. No, two doctors told me, I do not necessarily have a predisposition toward an auto-immune shock just because I once had sarcoidosis. And no, the New Rochelle, N.Y., testing facility told me, no one in my family currently has COVID-19. In short, I have no reason to believe I am any more at risk than any other 52-year-old of dying from the coronavirus.    Getting comfortable with uncertainty    It’s important to remember that my doctors could not provide information on what might sound like an important counterfactual.      That is, they could not conclude that my prior contraction of a lung-impairing disease does not put me at higher risk. They simply don’t have enough information, either from the rather murky generalized data on sarcoid (it’s a very poorly understood disease), or the very fresh, incomplete data around COVID-19. There may well be an unknown heightened risk relationship, but it’s just as possible that my sarcoid experience has made me less vulnerable; maybe it hardened my immune system. They just don’t know.      Some might find this conclusion unsatisfying. In a panicked world that’s absorbing horrifying stories of under-resourced hospitals, the “what if’s” keep going through your head. Indeed, it’s the not-knowingness that makes the whole coronavirus experience unsettling.      In the age of Google, Siri and Alexa, we’ve become used to immediate facts at our fingertips or ears. That’s just adding to how jarring the limited information on this frightening topic is for us.      The reactions to this information void are doing great harm to our way of life and economy as it necessitates drastic actions like the one I originally decided to take.      So, how about this? Just imagine if we knew where all the contagious people were (not their names and identities!). What if there were a threshold of comprehensive-enough testing and data gathering that, if crossed, would trigger appropriate adjustments to practices? Deploy resources here, apply a stricter containment policy there, figure out which of the less affected regions can be opened up and monitored to keep the economy going and to provide vital resources to those in lockdown.      That would limit the economic and psychological damage. Instead, we are all forced to take extreme measures “out of an abundance of caution,” as so many school closure statements have said.      Still, the lesson from my experience is that we don’t need perfect information – a concept that’s obviously an illusion at the best of times – just a sufficient amount, and of reliable quality, to make well-justified decisions.      The caveat of uncertainty from my pulmonologist was always a given. There’s nothing he could say to take that away. What mattered is the absence of any information suggesting that I am at higher risk, and the fact that this was communicated to me by a professional who is well-informed and – this is key – trustworthy. It meant I could look upon all those terrifying stories I’d read about sepsis in a more rational way. There was nothing to say my immune system was more or less likely to experience such a self-destructive overreaction than anyone else’s.      That, for now, is comforting. I’m still working from home, still rationing my family’s interactions with the outside world, and still practicing a far greater level of good hygiene than I ever did before. But the point is that I got useful information that gave me greater peace of mind.      It meant that in balancing the risk to my physical health from expanded social exposure against the need to protect my mental health and emotional wellbeing by staying close to my loved ones, I could, for now, err toward the latter.    Emotional well-being    I want the same thing in the wider world. We need reliable, collective information to make community decisions that benefit our shared economic and social wellbeing. And that all depends on data – lots of it, of good quality.      Finally, U.S. testing is ramping up. Without getting me started on the whole, stomach-churning CDC vs. WHO test kit debacle that delayed this process, let’s all now collectively think about how to get this new data out and into decision-makers’ hands.      The good news is information technology is one thing the U.S. does really, really well. America has the best data scientists in the world. Also, here’s where the good part of Silicon Valley comes in: there’s a rebellious instinct that’s always looking for workarounds, that’s biased toward “permissionless” action. It’s the instinct that essentially gave us the Internet. These qualities will save us.    'Permissionless' testing data    I’ll leave you with one example of this bias toward innovation that truly raised my spirits yesterday: a website created by Danny Yang – the founder of block explorer Blockseer. (For the crypto newbies reading this, a block explorer is a tool that makes it easier to read and follow the transactions recorded in a blockchain.)      Danny’s creation, which you can find at coronavirusapi.com, scrapes official coronavirus test data in real-time from all 50 states and D.C. and aggregates them into easy-to-comprehend reports and charts. It is the first aggregator of this vitally important information that uses official numbers rather than news reports. Now, they’re looking into smart, blockchain-based solutions to timestamp the reports to reinforce the transparency, accountability and reliability around that data. That combination is what’s key: fast, comprehensive, easy to read, but also trustworthy.      Here’s a snapshot of what the home page looks like.      No permission was needed for this site. No official deal between the White House and Google was made. There’s no back and forth over the right outward-facing PR about a website whose capabilities are being overpromised by misinformed leaders. Just a quick and dirty solution to an important problem and a natural bias toward quickly publishing the information.      It’s about getting access to the right data, making sure it’s trustworthy, and putting it out there to let the people decide. This reminds me of the spirit of the early days of the Internet, as well as of the early days of Twitter and other social media providers, before advertisers and surveillance capitalists took them over.      Restoring that bias toward information and community action may well be the silver lining in this otherwise frightening experience.      We’ll get through this, people. But the more trustworthy information we get out there, the quicker we will do so.      #DataSavesLives",NEUTRAL,없음,TECHNOLOGY,Michael J.

The new director for European sales will promote and grow Gemini's business across Europe and the U.K. as well as ""generate new business"" by creating relationships with institutional clients, the exchange said in a LinkedIn post on Tuesday.      The new sales director will work closely with Gemini's European managing director in the London office but will report directly to the managing director of operations based in New York. While the exchange already has a U.S.-based sales team, the new role is designed to enhance the exchange's institutional global sales capability.      Speaking to CoinDesk at the CryptoCompare Digital Asset Summit last week, Julian Sawyer, managing director of Gemini Europe, said European expansion was ""critically important.""      ""Gemini is very well known in the states, particularly in New York; coming here, Gemini has a lower profile ... so we need to build that up and the credibility,"" said Sawyer, who joined Gemini in December after being chief operating officer of Starling, a U.K. challenger bank.      ""Part of what I'm doing is just letting people know that we [Gemini] are here ... that we've got a little bit more serious in the crypto world by hiring bankers,"" he added.      As part of this new charm offensive, Sawyer said Gemini was already talking with local fintech providers about possible API integrations. The newly formed institutional sales division will begin cultivating relationships with big players in both the U.K. and Europe months or even years before they consider becoming a full Gemini client.      Although Gemini is only hiring a sales director currently, Sawyer added the exchange planned to hire more members for its European sales team as its regional presence continues to expand.

According to a job opening posted late last month, the firm wants to hire a director of anti-money laundering (AML) and blockchain strategy. The new staffer at PayPal’s New York City office would be responsible for “evaluating blockchain use cases with an eye towards financial crimes risk management and overseeing AML investigative activities and emerging trends in this space,” the ad states.      The new director will also assess risks related to the companies in PayPal’s blockchain-related portfolio and “lead external partner diligence meetings related to blockchain opportunities and potential.” The successful candidate will need to be a compliance professional with no fewer than 10 years of experience.      PayPal has already been expressing interest in blockchain-based compliance initiatives. Last April it invested in Cambridge Blockchain, a startup using distributed ledger for managing sensitive data. PayPal chose to invest in Cambridge Blockchain “because it is applying blockchain for digital identity in a way that we believe could benefit financial services companies including PayPal,” a company spokesperson told CoinDesk at the time.

42404243,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhdcr,1584547211,Controversial Group Behind Coronavirus Tracking App Has Crypto Ties,"The coronavirus crisis may highlight the overlap between the surveillance state and the cryptocurrency industry.      The Israeli tech company NSO Group, best known for selling spyware to Saudi Arabia and other governments, is reportedly working on a new product to monitor the spread of coronavirus. Nearly a dozen countries are testing the software, Bloomberg reported.      NSO Group’s surveillance technology has attracted widespread criticism from privacy-minded technologists in the crypto sector and beyond – for covertly accessing phones, activating cameras and collecting location data. Still, the company’s top ranks have significant ties to the blockchain industry, CoinDesk has learned.    Several NSO Group foundershttps://www.foundersgroup.com/great-ideas-1 and investors are also funding blockchain companies. For example, co-founders Omri Lavie and Shalev Hulio have invested in the bitcoin startup Simplex, while NSO Group investor Eddy Shalev has invested in the non-custodial wallet startup Portis, the exchange platform eToro and the privacy startup QEDIT. Eddy Shalev’s LinkedIn account also listed him as on the board of the bitcoin mining company Spondoolies Tech, which reportedly closed in 2016.    “There’s a lot of what the cryptocurrency space is doing that is recreating what is already happening with traditional finance,” QEDIT CEO Jonathan Rouach said of Eddy Shalev. “He was one of the first people to recognize that banks will be interested in the same [blockchain] technology, but maybe not public consensus [mechanisms].”      The three investors did not respond to requests for comment by press time. Another source with knowledge of QEDIT’s operations said the startup is not involved with the NSO Group’s coronavirus monitoring app.      Although it’s unclear how these investors personally interact with the bitcoin (BTC) market, a former NSO Group employee allegedly tried to sell stolen software for $50 million worth of cryptocurrency in 2018. A source familiar with the matter said the above-mentioned investors are active bitcoiners, but declined to provide more details.      Many bitcoiners imagine the crux of their movement lies in the divide between government agencies and cypherpunks. As a company making software tools for intelligence agencies, NSO Group shows there may be a significant overlap between the two worlds.      NSO Group isn’t the first case of such overlap either. Coinbase famously sparked industrywide backlash in 2019 when it acquired Neutrino, founded by three former members of a controversial Italian surveillance vendor called Hacking Team.      To quell the kerfuffle, the San Francisco-based crypto exchange said those members would ""transition out of Coinbase,"" but has not since confirmed such a transition took place.

The Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) will begin more strictly regulating virtual currency companies, transactions and activities following after new rules take effect on June 1, according to a departmental report released in early March.      “A major priority in the near term will be the implementation of new regulations arising from recent legislative change” that gave FINTRAC new oversight of the virtual currency space, the agency said in the report.      Passed as an amendment to Canada’s criminal finance framework last June, the sweeping powers are “expected” to produce an “enhanced AML/ATF Regime,” in Canada, FINTRAC said in the report. FINTRAC is the Canadian counterpart to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) in the U.S.      Some of the highlights include a requirement that companies with $10,000 CAD in crypto activity register as a money services business, which comes with new regulations. Companies must also document sender and receivers’ name, address, birth date, phone number and crypto type for crypto transactions over $1,000 CAD in some instances. More extensive documentation requirements apply to transactions of $10,000 CAD and above.      Violations are largely classified as “minor” infractions under the amendments.      The virtual currency amendments were Canada’s response to FATF’s blistering 2015-2016 assessment of its virtual currency AML and CFT frameworks as “deficient.” As a member of FATF, Canada is expected to meet certain thresholds.      FINTRAC alluded to this “expectation” in its March report, saying “the overall legislative and policy framework must serve Canada's interests while staying attuned to international expectations.”      Other countries, and exchanges, are also working fast to get in line before FATF’s June deadline.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/03/18/canadas-financial-crimes-watchdog-gets-ready-for-fatf-compliance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fc77e7449242c9123ab6cb21d7f65bac2f77dd78-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404246,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhdep,1584540000,Tezos Co-Founder Turns to Gaming With ‘Hearthstone’ Competitor,"Digital card games like Hearthstone are fun, but getting the cards needed to play is not.      That's a problem Coase – a company launched by Tezos co-founder Kathleen Breitman – aims to solve with its new game, Emergents.      The new title, whose alpha version opens up to a select few in early April, comes as the market for online card games nears $2 billion in size and coronavirus-related shutdowns drive gamers indoors.      Coase’s innovation: Let people easily acquire and swap the cards they actually want.      ""Providing optionality makes people feel better and also it promotes experimentation, which is something that seems to have been lost in the transition to digital,"" Breitman told CoinDesk in an interview.      In collectible card games, there are two giants. The original, analog version, Magic: The Gathering, which is arguably the most successful brand in the Hasbro portfolio; and the digital Hearthstone, which brings in an estimated $400 million for its owner, Blizzard Entertainment. But both have issues with how cards get distributed.      For those who have never played Magic, cards are distributed in physical packs, which each have a distribution of cards of different rarities. Generally speaking, only one or two cards per pack are worth holding. Anyone who plays knows they will inevitably end up with loads of unwanted duplicates. There's a strong secondary market for Magic cards but the game's maker has largely pretended it doesn't exist.      Hearthstone is more complicated. Players get free cards. They can buy packs. They can also trade in their cards to get other cards, sort of, but they lose a lot of value when they do that. So, ""Hearthstone"" has a built-in secondary market, but it's very extractive.      For Coase co-founder Zvi Mowshowitz – who is also a 2007 inductee to Magic Hall of Fame – both distribution approaches leave a lot to be desired.      Emergents will take a radically simple approach: Let people buy the cards they want.      Brian David-Marshall, a third co-founder, said Coase has ""an economic model for doing a collectible card game on the blockchain that captures a lot of what makes physical card games great.""    Cards as tokens    Coase will be the primary and secondary marketplace all in one. Like bitcoin on Square’s Cash App, Coase will be the seller and the buyer for Emergents cards, essentially acting as a market maker.      The company is using bonding curves, much like Ethereum's token-swapping platform Uniswap, to distribute the cards. Cards will have a fixed supply and their prices will swing with demand, determined by an algorithm. New cards will come out and be sold on the site at a low price.      Each card sold will make the next card sold just a little pricier, but each card sold back to Coase will make the next card sold a little cheaper. When the market for a given card is saturated, it will be cheap. As the card gets scarce, it will go way up in price.      Cards can be sold back to the company at something like 95 percent of their value. ""One of the things we wanted to take advantage of with this blockchain technology is giving people the opportunity to feel really smart,"" David-Marshall said.      So, for example, there could be a card that looks just OK to most players, but any longtime player of Magic knows that the value of cards can change swiftly as the community learns the game. If some player built a deck that did great things with that card, word would get around and it would go up in value fast.      So in this case ""feeling smart"" would also mean the option to sell a card back to Coase's market for a nice gain.      Users can trade directly, of course; this is crypto, and people will be able to set up exchanges for the cards as well. But the founders hope the user experience of buying and selling most cards through Coase will be so good that players will primarily rely on their markets.      That said, the founders were very clear that the company will not resist users trading cards however they wish. Once they buy them, they are theirs to use however they wish.      The whole project is being built on Tezos, so all trades will be made in the blockchain's native cryptocurrency, XTZ, but the company is also working to hide this behind fiat rails for users who don't care about the crypto aspect.      Going digital also allows the company to spin up interesting mechanics. For example, one of the most popular forms of Magic is ""draft,"" where everyone buys three packs but players get some choice about what cards they keep.      Emergents plans a phantom draft, where players will have a similar experience but can then choose whether they want to buy cards they played with at the end of the game (or not).    Blockchain's perks    Some cards will become more unique with use, which is where there might be opportunities for exchanges in uniquely blockchain-y circumstances.      For example, Magic cards cannot keep track of games the cards have played. Digital cards can.      So it all depends on how popular the games get, but if the fandom gets big enough, serious fans might care about somewhat intangible qualities of the game that can be logged and proven on the blockchain, even if they don't impact gameplay.      ""Our cards have memory,"" Mowshowitz said.      That means a card could have a record showing that it played in the winning deck at a major tournament. An artist or player could also digitally sign someone's card, proving that the collector has met someone from the digital experience.      Coase's bonding-curve-governed pools probably won't be good at illuminating the card's memory, which could create an opportunity for entrepreneurs to create a marketplace for cards with unique provenances. If the fanbase gets large enough, that is.      However, one key question anyone from centralized gaming will wonder is this: Will the company mess with supply?      For example, if the game suddenly spikes in popularity and supply gets tight, will they wreck card values by quickly pumping up supply?      The Coase co-founders were very clear on this: No. Cards will come out with fixed supplies and they will stick to it, which could be painful one day for players who really want something but also great for people who got that card early.      The view of the Coase team was that it had to be that way.      ""This is crypto,"" Mowshowitz said.    Enough about the cards. What about the game?    Right, the game.      Of course, the plan for Coase works best if its first game comes out strong.      Emergents is still in alpha, but basically it's a game of pitting super-beings against super-beings. The intellectual property is from an analog deck-builder created by David-Marshall called Emergents: Genesis.      Players act as the team leader of a gang of super-beings who are slowly coming out and attempting to attack the other player. To attack they first have to get past their opponent’s own team of super-beings. The games are divided into different factions, powered by different sorts of resources.      ""The way you build your resources to play cards is by playing cards,"" David-Marshall said.      There are some elements of the game where the Coase team believes they've added innovations to the form, but these don't hinge on the game’s usage of blockchain technology.      ""I think the needle that Zvi and Brian are trying to thread,"" Breitman explained, ""is making a game that has a lot of strategic depth that can also be enjoyed by novices.""      There's also the ability to put cards on the field without using them immediately. That is, removing them from your hand but waiting for the right time to activate them.      To start, there will be a bunch of tutorials. The company will release a base set of free cards everyone can start with, in a format called ""free card constructed."" Then other cards will come out each week that players can buy. This means there will be new cards all the time; it also means when the game gets out of balance in some way, Coase can quickly print new cards that deal with it.      Additionally, the company will eventually release a software development kit (SDK) that would even allow users to create experiences for using their cards (new formats, new rules, new limitations). Magic cards have a basic game attached to them but players have invented lots of new games based on the cards. A player with some coding skill could do the same eventually with Emergents.      And if blockchains start communicating effectively, Emergents could even evolve beyond Tezos. There is, after all, a full metaverse for games out there.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/18/tezos-co-founder-turns-to-gaming-with-hearthstone-competitor,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ec99bc047a15a09b936fb0d831446642c9166913-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

CoinZoom supports most prominent cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin (BC) or ether (ETH), in pairs with the U.S. dollar, providing a fiat gateway into the asset class. The platform also includes a staking facility for selected proof-of-stake (PoS) coins, which provide rewards for holders.      The exchange, which already has a trading app available for Apple iOS devices, can also be used as a remittance solution, according to CoinZoom founder and CEO Todd Crosland.      “CoinZoom is not only the first U.S. cryptocurrency exchange to provide a Visa card to its customers, but also offers ... industry-first features like ZoomMe, CoinZoom’s free Peer-to-Peer crypto and fiat payment system,"" he said      Last year, U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, which is also a registered MSB with FinCEN, released its own Visa-backed debit card, but only for users based in the U.K. and European Union.

42404225,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhdT1,1584536400,Argentina's Gas Regulator Greenlights Industry Blockchain Built With RSK Tech,"Argentina’s national gas regulator has given Gasnor, a natural gas distributor for two million residents, approval to pilot a smart contract-based certification platform.      Gasnet, a permissioned blockchain platform from IOV Labs and software builder Grupo Sabra, was launched Wednesday with approval from regulator Enargas, according to the firms involved. Running on an enterprise version of the RSK Smart Contract Network, Gasnet is designed to secure and speed Argentina’s chronically delayed gas certification processes.      “When you want to certify a new gas connection for a home or a company today you need to send many documents,” said Grupo Sabra co-founder Pedro Perrota. From technician-consumer agreements to certification paperwork and other documentation, “all those things today in Argentina take a lot of time” to process, Perrota said. Up to three months, in fact.      Not so under Gasnet. In the now-operational consortium network, certification documents and transaction details zip between Gasnor and Enargas, each of whom run a network node. That increases visibility and smooths out otherwise crippling delays, Perrota says, allowing technicians to ultimately bring consumer’s gas services online faster.      “They are basically using the blockchain to certify the different steps,” said IOV Labs CEO Diego Gutierrez. “They’re giving private keys to each one of the professionals involved in the process, so they do the certification work using this shared system.”      Certification is just the beginning, though. IOV Labs and Grupo Sabra say Gasnet’s shared ecosystem can facilitate any number of services. Technician’s credentials, for example, are crucially important, given the dangerous nature of natural gas infrastructure.      But what of an unscrupulous contractor who flees a checkered safety history in Buenos Aires and sets up shop instead in, say, the far smaller town of Salta in the country's north? Under the current system, his track record does not necessarily follow him north, but with Gasnet it would.      “When you have a common database, everyone can see your track record,” Pedro Perrota said.      Gasnet has even bigger goals, too. It wants to become the common database for Argentina’s entire gas distribution ecosystem, for all nine regulated companies, Perrota and Gutierrez said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/18/argentinas-gas-regulator-greenlights-industry-blockchain-built-with-rsk-tech,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3bd6055b19c469105f1857328535ab5a7807c496-1500x995.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404228,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhdU0,1584532800,BitGo Allows Customers to Extend Crypto Insurance Cover Over $100M,"Customers of digital asset security specialist BitGo can now boost their insurance limit beyond $100 million to cover the loss or destruction of crypto stored in special vaults.      BitGo came out with a Lloyd’s-backed cold storage insurance product in February 2019 and is now allowing customers to extend the $100 million worth of cover to suit their needs. It’s a sign of the continued maturation of the crypto insurance sector.      “We’ve had lots of demand from small to large firms,” said Rodrigo Vicuna, BitGo’s CFO. “There have been small exchanges looking for an extra $5 million or $10 million. We also have had requests for as high as a couple hundred million. It really just depends on the size of the client and how much financial backstop is right for them.”      A couple of years back, crypto custodians and large exchanges struggled to secure insurance against the loss of digital assets. But more recently, syndicates within Lloyd’s of London specialist insurance market have been taking on more risk and increasing capacity in the market.      BitGo’s crypto policy is covered by Lloyd’s “specie market,” to use insurance industry parlance. This means insurance against theft or damage from vaults that typically hold cash, gold, fine art and so on.      For crypto, this means a $100 million worth of cover, plus any excess added on, is to insure against the loss of digital assets from devices that are not and will never be connected to the internet. It covers loss from insider theft and if a third party gains physical access to storage media and cryptographic keys.      BitGo announced the first customer for its new policy is Hong Kong-based exchange Crypto.com. Kris Marszalek, co-founder and CEO of Crypto.com, said in a statement, “BitGo carries a robust insurance program, elevating the scope of protection for our digital assets in their custody and providing further assurance to our customers that their funds are safe and protected.”      BitGo’s excess policy offering is arranged through insurance broker Woodruff-Sawyer & Co. in partnership with London’s Paragon Brokers.      As well as expanding its cold storage cover, BitGo also gives customers the option to add some hot wallet cover, thanks to a relationship with U.K.-based Coincover, which recently announced it was backed by Lloyd’s. Coincover offers a crime policy covering third-party hacks, by far the most common means by which crypto is stolen.      BitGo had previously teamed with Digital Asset Insurance (DAI), which later changed its name to Coincover. The partnership meant BitGo business clients could purchase theft insurance and a key recovery service.      “Anybody with a BitGo wallet could get hot-wallet coverage with us,” said David Janczewski, Coincover’s CEO.      Janczewski said Lloyd’s offers the policy on a case-by-case basis. In terms of the typical limits to what is available for hot wallet cover “it's in the millions, possibly tens of millions,” he said.      “When we came out with that announcement back in 2019 saying you can now have optional hot wallet insurance up to your limit, the reason we designed that program was so BitGo would provide the initial protection,” said BitGo’s Vicuna. “Then, on top of that, clients each have their unique needs.”",POSITIVE,DAI,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | DAI,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/18/bitgo-allows-customers-to-extend-crypto-insurance-cover-over-100m,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a301291419eb5e3b030f53a120c45f984355352a-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404244,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhdfo,1584530464,Bitcoin Faces Another Down Day as Equities Reject Stimulus Efforts,"Bitcoin (BTC) is again feeling the pull of gravity as investors offload risk in traditional markets despite the massive U.S. stimulus package this week.      The top cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading near $5,050, having failed to establish a strong foothold above $5,500 late Tuesday., according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      Prices were better bid 24 hours ago when global equities were flashing green. Sentiment, however, soured during Wednesday's Asian trading hours and futures tied to the S&P 500 fell by 5 percent, triggering a ""limit down"" – the maximum percentage decline possible in one trading day.      Asian equities also put in a weak performance, providing negative cues to the major European equity indices, which are currently down at least 3 percent.      “Global equities markets continue to reject stimulus efforts put forward by the U.S., with the S&P 500 recording its largest one day drop on Monday since 1987,"" said Matthew Dibb, co-founder and COO of Stack, a provider of cryptocurrency trackers and index funds.      See also: Why Bitcoin Is the Only Truly Free Market, Feat. Dan Tapiero      The U.S. Federal Reserve delivered an emergency rate cut of 100 basis points early Monday and announced new quantitative easing in the form of at least $700 billion in asset purchases. Further, the Trump administration said Tuesday it's planning to send checks directly to U.S. citizens as part of a $1 trillion stimulus program.      Even so, the stock markets are flashing red, which likely indicates investors are worried that monetary easing will not spur economic activity. After all, the threat to global supply and demand is not being caused by institutional systemic failures but by measures related to the growing coronavirus pandemic.      As a result, a sustainable price recovery in both stocks and bitcoin may remain elusive until there is a stabilization in the coronavirus infection curve.      ""However, if the impact of the coronavirus outbreak intensifies beyond the global lockdown we are already experiencing, it could spark a further run for cash,"" Simon Peters, analyst and crypto-asset expert at multiasset investment platform eToro, told CoinDesk.      Should that happen, investors may again look to bitcoin as a source of liquidity, leading to another wave of selling.      Bitcoin is currently consolidating, showing indecision in the marketplace, said Peters. That seems to be the case as the cryptocurrency is stuck in a triangle pattern on an intraday chart.    4-hour chart    Bitcoin has carved out an ascending triangle that comprises two trendlines – a horizontal line connecting price resistance and a rising trendline joining higher lows.      A four-hour close above the upper edge of the triangle, currently at $5,945, would open confirm an ascending breakout and open the doors for $6,425 (December low).      However, if the lower end of the triangle at $4,865 is breached, more sellers may join the market, yielding a re-test of recent lows under $4,000.    Daily chart    The 14-day relative strength index is signaling oversold conditions with a below-30 reading, while the MACD histogram is producing higher lows below the zero line, a sign of weakening bearish momentum.      A triangle breakout on the 4-hour chart, if confirmed, could be followed by a quick rally to $6,000.

Karanjit Singh Khatkar and Jagroop Singh Khatkar, both from Surrey, British Columbia, were sentenced on March 17 to 24 months in federal prison with three years supervised release for conspiring to commit wire fraud and money laundering involving bitcoin (BTC).      According to a U.S. Department of Justice Attorney's Office press release Tuesday, a probe by the Federal Bureau of Investigation found the defendants sought to trick victims into thinking they were discussing customer service matters with representatives from Hong Kong-based crypto exchange HitBTC.      In October 2017, the defendants used a Twitter account with the handle @HitBTCAssist to pose as HitBTC staff to manipulate one victim into handing over 23.2 BTC (worth $118,000 at today's prices) from a HitBTC wallet to Karanjit Khatkar’s wallet on the Kraken exchange.      The Khatkars also convinced the Oregon resident to hand over information that could be used to compromise the victim's accounts including email as well as exchange account details.

On Dec. 16, 2019, the Khatkars pleaded guilty to the charges and were ordered to pay $142,349 in prepayment restitution during a change of plea hearing.

42404235,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhdYv,1584525600,"Banks Have to Embrace Distributed Ledger Tech, Even if It Kills Them","Chuck Fried is the president and CEO of TxMQ, a technology consulting and integration company specializing in the financial services industry. He has more than 30 years of experience helping banks set up, manage, transform and evolve their IT systems to improve customer service and reduce the risk of fraud and data loss.      As someone who spends a large amount of time inside IT departments of major banks, I like to tell people two things. The first is that some of the brightest and cleverest people I’ve ever met work in bank technology groups. The second is that many banks have facilitated a culture of complacency when it comes to technological transformation.      I find this attitude often presents itself as fear – more specifically, fear of change. It’s understandable: Over time a leading market position, steady successes and routine, if not staggering, annual growth starts to make one feel immune from competition. You begin to become complacent. And what is complacency really but fear of change?      Nowhere is this complacency more evident than in the way the banking industry is looking at distributed ledger technology (DLT or blockchain). I see DLT treated as anything from a passing fancy to an unwelcome distraction by banking IT leaders. In my experience, these attitudes are the result of a lack of information about the tech. To that end, here’s what I tell bank leaders about blockchain and DLT.    The power of entropy    For decades, banks operated in virtual vacuums. Few external pressures could touch them. Customers made deposits and took out loans. The delta between savings rates and loan rates was the bank’s operating profits. That business model created tremendous wealth for banks in the U.S. and around the world. The system all worked perfectly – until it didn’t.      Throughout banking history what little innovation that has occurred has proceeded at a glacial pace, typically being driven by what we would today call “fintechs.” New technologies came primarily in the form of point solutions built by outside firms: Check imaging, for instance, didn’t originate in bank in-house technology groups, but rather at external firms that were later absorbed by banks. In short, most of the tech we see, use and expect from our banks was built somewhere else and later acquired by banks.      Now, though, banks are increasingly threatened by the rise of competitors including alternative banks and the modern fintech economy. These businesses come primarily out of Silicon Valley startup culture, which emphasizes disruption rather than continuity with established business models. With either innovative tech (mobile banking) or innovative business models (e.g., online lending marketplaces) or both, they are gobbling up whole customers bases that have been traditionally held by the big banks. Take mortgages, for instance: The top five U.S. banks accounted for just 21 percent of mortgage originations in 2019, compared to half of all mortgages in 2011.    Beyond 'innovaphobia'    These developments are forcing banks to confront their fear of change in a way they haven’t had to previously. The result is that many are forcing themselves to innovate faster than they ever have before. That’s why when I work with banking clients I’m constantly bringing up DLT as one of a number of new technologies to explore.      It should be taken as gospel that banks have an inherent fear of innovation, but even within that mindset DLT occupies a uniquely anxious space. Technology may be all ones and zeroes but there’s something about digital ledgers that makes bank IT teams' heads spin.      What I tell these skeptics is that while they’ve been complacent and resting on their laurels, blockchain POCs have been quietly winning the day. The technology works. Works amazingly well for the right use cases. Blockchain startups, pursuing applications from cross-border payments to supply chain management to digital identity management, are now too numerous to name. Major economists have in recent years embraced blockchain as part of a solution to address various global finance challenges. The upshot: If your banking institution isn’t already putting R&D work into blockchain solutions, then you’re already behind.      I’ve found that clients don’t really know what to do with DLT. They don’t understand the right use cases, and so often suggest ideas that sound really interesting, but aren’t well suited to the technology. Educating banks on what DLT can do and what it cannot is thus crucial.    Banking on blockchain    It bears noting that some of the most interesting and potentially game changing use cases are those that present the greatest existential threat to banks. Banks are middle people. Intermediaries. Customers deposit, banks lend.      What if we didn’t need this service and could eliminate this need for the bank as a ""third party"" to transact? What if we could interact directly using DLT, without a need for a financial services intermediary at all?      This is the true promise of blockchain. Transactionality in a trustless world. This is where fintechs play, and banks fear to tread.      Thus, paradoxically, DLT is both a threat and an opportunity for banks. The threat as laid out above is that banks’ own resistance to change will lead to them watching the opportunity of DLT pass them by – because DLT is going to transform the economy, with or without their leadership. If banks want to secure their futures, it is vital that they confront their fear of change and embrace innovation in all its disruptive splendor. That’s the opportunity in front of them now.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Chuck Fried,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/18/banks-have-to-embrace-distributed-ledger-tech-even-if-it-kills-them,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cc3c40f3b1e39163a5ebbf1cbbada5e503e9a034-1200x675.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404232,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhdVy,1584517500,Wave Financial to Tokenize $20M Worth of Bourbon for New Whiskey Fund,"Digital asset manager Wave Financial is tokenizing a whole year's production of Kentucky bourbon so global investors can gain exposure to the growing U.S. whiskey market.      Wave announced Wednesday it had finalized an agreement with the Danville, Kentucky-based Wilderness Trail Distillery to tokenize between 10,000 and 20,000 barrels of bourbon whiskey, worth up to $20 million, that will be made publicly available through a specialized digital asset fund.      Known as the Wave Kentucky Whiskey 2020 Digital Fund, investors will be able to purchase asset-backed tokens linked to an inventory of whiskey barreled this year. Stored and maintained by the Wilderness Trail Distillery, Wave estimates the fund will represent as many as four million bottles of bourbon.      The U.S. whiskey market has experienced something of a renaissance, becoming the most exported U.S. spirit in 2018. Over the past 10 years, domestic production capacity has repeatedly expanded year on year in order to meet demand.      By tokenizing it, Wave says investors can gain exposure to bourbon's value appreciation and can also share some of the proceeds from when the whiskey is sold wholesale to merchants, three years after the whiskey is first distilled and tokens issued to investors.      Wave's president and manager of the new whiskey fund, Benjamin Tsai, said in an announcement the fund gave investors a ""rare opportunity to access this unique asset class traditionally unavailable due to high upfront costs and purchase minimums, low liquidity, scarcity of production capacity, and technical know-how.""      Unlike many other consumable goods, which perish and lose value over time, whiskey does the opposite: the older the whiskey, the more valuable it becomes.      This is due to whiskey's natural aging process. Once distilled, the spirit is stored in a barrel so ingredients continue to mix and the water either evaporates or soaks into the wooden barrel, improving the whiskey's flavor and making it more valuable.      Specifically with the bourbon Wave selected, markup can increase from $1,000 per barrel when first distilled to as much as $4,000 five years down the line.      Tsai told CoinDesk that a fund administrator and auditor will calculate the value of the barrels on a quarterly basis, which will be presented a regular inventory report and will provide investors will a benchmark price for their tokens.      Users will be able to trade their tokens at whatever price they wish.

Gox has claimed the plaintiff holding him liable for losses incurred after the exchange collapsed breached precedent by changing the claims in his complaint.      In a motion filed with the federal court of the Northern District of Illinois on Monday, Mark Karpeles claims Gregory Greene, who first sued in February 2014, changed the underlying basis for his claim in an attempt to ""thwart"" a motion calling for summary judgment.      Karpeles says Greene – who filed his initial complaint against Karpeles and Mt. Gox the day the exchange declared bankruptcy – violated court precedent by bringing a ""host of new factual allegations"" not alleged in the original class action complaint.      ""Mr. Greene doomed his fraud claim by directly contradicting the underlying allegations in his Complaint of the purported fraud or deception during discovery,"" reads the filing. ""His addition of new allegations of fraud in response to a motion to summary judgment violates Seventh Circuit precedent.""      The filing claims Greene changed his claim to include allegations from other complainants that signed up to the exchange on the basis of Mt. Gox's Terms of Use, which assured users the exchange had enough cash and bitcoin (BTC) to cover users' deposits.      Although Greene argued he has always said this was part of his complaint, Karpeles argued in the filing that this was ""impossible, as [Greene's] creation of an account and making a deposit on the Mt. Gox Exchange preceded the existence of the Terms of Use by at least more than two weeks.""      Karpeles has accused Greene of attempting to change his claim so it could stand up to summary judgment – a motion allowing a presiding judge to rule on a case before it goes to trial and usually granted in cases where the outcome is considered a foregone conclusion.      Greene's original complaint included three claims: the fraud claim, as well as since-dismissed counts of negligence and conversion. Some original allegations, like a purported statement on the Mt. Gox website claiming the exchange was useful as a safe place to store bitcoin, were renounced at the original deposition.      Last March, a judge refused a motion by Karpeles to stay the U.S. case. In a separate case brought forward in Japan, Karpeles was cleared of charges of embezzlement and breach of trust but found guilty of manipulating exchange data.

Avanti Financial Group, the first firm to announce its application to be a special purpose depository institution in Wyoming, announced five new executive hires who will also be co-founders on Tuesday, including Bitcoin Core developer Bryan Bishop and Figure Technology’s Zev Shimko.      “It was important to find people with experience in both crypto and traditional finance services because the two are so different,” Caitlin Long, CEO of Avanti, told CoinDesk. “It’s hard to find an innovator in the core banking business, but we needed one because we’ll be integrating crypto with core banking software.”      A SPDI bank looks like a regular custody bank without the ability to lend. SPDI banks regulated by the Wyoming Division of Banking can offer services for digital assets without the oversight of the risk adverse U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.      Bishop is coming on as the firm’s chief technology officer. In 2018, Bishop was a senior blockchain engineer and custody architect at LedgerX, the first Commodity Futures Trading Commission-regulated options exchange and clearinghouse for digital assets. He has also created Bitcoin Vaults, a pre-signed anti-theft recovery and drawback mechanism for bitcoin.      “For everybody, crypto custody is a given core skills set,” Long said. “The fact that Bryan has already done this at LedgerX puts him in a small group of people who have built secure crypto custody platforms that are proven in the marketplace and have survived daily attacks from adversaries.”      Community banking veteran Britney Reddy will become the bank’s chief of banking operations and chief financial officer. Reddy has held CEO, president, CTO, CCO and COO roles at multiple Wyoming banks.      Shimko, who was a director at Figure, will become Avanti’s chief operating officer. Before Figure, Shimko was head of corporate development at SALT, a crypto-backed lender. Shimko began his career at Morgan Stanley in global capital markets.      Former Blockchain Consulting CEO and LedgerX Chief Compliance Officer Chuck Thompson is joining the firm as chief legal officer. Prior to that, he was in-house counsel at multiple capital markets firms, including Morgan Stanley.      In February, Avanti announced it was teaming up with blockchain technology startup Blockstream to provide payment, custody, securities and commodities activities for institutional customers using digital assets. The bank plans to launch in early 2021, pending the approval of its SPDI charter by the Wyoming Division of Banking.

42431650,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4Yrh,1584504000,"Thieves Swindle $2M From Coronavirus Preppers With Hand Sanitizer, Face Mask Scams","Scammers purporting to sell pandemic essentials – such as face masks, hand sanitizer and medication – have stolen at least $2 million in cryptocurrency from panicking consumers, claims blockchain security firm AnChain.AI.      The haul comes from low-budget malicious actors putting a fresh riff on a classic ruse: money paid for products never delivered. Striking amid a public health crisis in which hospital systems from Milan to Seattle are getting crushed by COVID-19 patients and governments are fretting if their emergency stockpiles can meet unprecedented demand, scammers are looking to consumers, also weary of the novel coronavirus, as a boon.      “Criminals are exploiting the fear and uncertainty created by COVID-19 to prey on innocent citizens who are only looking to protect their health and that of their loved ones,” said INTERPOL Secretary General Jürgen Stock, in a recent coronavirus consumer fraud notice from Europe’s police force.      Some of these scams are being facilitated through crypto, said Steven Yang, AnChain.AI’s marketing director. His firm claims to have traced millions of dollars worth of swindled crypto funds in the first two weeks of an investigative partnership with an unnamed “affiliated law enforcement agency” in Asia.    Scammers strike    AnChain.AI’s leadership has taken a top-down approach to investigating the coronavirus medical supply scams.      “Our CEO actually ordered some face masks off of Amazon and had this done to him,” Yang said of AnChain.AI CEO Victor Fang, who in early February paid for a 100-pack of surgical masks that still have not come. (Fang did not pay in crypto for these masks).      Fang brought the scam to AnChain.AI’s immediate attention, but coronavirus fraud schemes have already been raging for months. Primarily in Asia, and particularly in regions infected well before the contagion’s recent march west, consumers have thronged to any apparent source of hard-to-come-by medical supplies, sometimes paying dubious vendors in crypto.      AnChain.AI said that two weeks ago it began investigating at the request of the unnamed law enforcement agency.      Investigators noticed a pattern: Scammers posted supplies on trusted e-commerce sites including Amazon, eBay, and social media marketplaces; then lured consumers off the sites, to messaging platforms with no third-party oversight; they then took payment and printed a phony shipping label as “proof” to fool the marketplace and the consumer.      Buyers were left thinking their medical supplies were days or weeks from arriving at their doorstep, realizing only weeks later they had been scammed. In some instances, Yang said, the scammers sent an empty box.      By that point the victims' crypto was long gone.      “They launder the money through a large number of jumping and pass-through addresses, or using things like tumblers and mixers, before liquidating through exchanges,” Yang explained.      So far, more than 90 percent of the scam crypto transactions were received in tether (USDT), 5 percent in bitcoin (BTC), 2 percent in ether (ETH) and a small amount in “a wide breadth” of other cryptocurrencies.      Many of the scams began in east and Southeast Asia, but some are now popping up around the world – even in the United States, according to Yang.      The swindled crypto does flow back to Asia, though.      “While we are still investigating this process, and the scam itself is observed worldwide, the liquidation itself is primarily going through big Asia-based exchanges,” said Yang, who suspects this is because of exchange rate and liquidity concerns (he declined to name the exchanges).    What to look out for    Yang said AnChain.AI’s investigation is ongoing and may begin expanding to other “nationalities.” Coronavirus shows no signs of stopping, and as such it is unlikely scammers will die down either.      In the long term AnChain.AI hopes to identify scammers at the point of exit – the exchanges – which would likely need to happen through official law enforcement inquiries and legal procedures. More immediately, though, the firm wants to raise awareness with a general public desperate to buy supplies and protect themselves during the ongoing public health crisis.      Yang offered some recommendations for pandemic shoppers: Don’t buy medical supplies from untrusted marketplaces; never conduct deals over WhatsApp and WeChat; and approach crypto-first vendors skeptically – some are indeed legitimate, but others may well be scammers.      “Anyone who is thinking of buying medical supplies online should take a moment and verify that you are in fact dealing with a legitimate, reputable company, otherwise your money could be lost to unscrupulous criminals,” Interpol Chief Jurgen Stock said in his presser.",NEGATIVE,BTC | USDT,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | USDT,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/18/thieves-swindle-2m-from-coronavirus-preppers-with-hand-sanitizer-face-mask-scams,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3145a7f8aa01a826dd48325b70550cafa4446937-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
