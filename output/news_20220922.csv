This event was the single most anticipated upgrade in the history of the network, and it had affected both price and funding rates in adverse ways. However, as the market begins to settle into the new normal of Ethereum being a proof of stake network, things are beginning to stabilize. One of those is funding rates returning to pre-Merge levels. Funding Rates Stabilizing The days leading up to the Ethereum Merge had been extremely volatile for the crypto market. Ethereum itself had borne the brunt of this, and even though the days leading up to the upgrade were filled with positive movement, it had quickly changed.

42373761,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvV5TX,1663884908,Ethereum Miners’ $319M Crypto Hoard Hangs Over Market After Merge,"In the years and months leading up to the Ethereum blockchain’s historic shift last week to a more energy-efficient system, data miners working for rewards on the network had accumulated nearly $341 million worth of the cryptocurrency ether (ETH).  Now, a week after the Merge, crypto analysts are warning that miners’ sales of their hoards could become a source of near-term, downward pressure on the cryptocurrency's price, with the market already sinking by 19% in the past month.  “Miners dumping their ETH is an overhang that we’ll have to get through over the coming months in order to resume up-only mode, but it will happen,” Lucas Campbell, editor of the Bankless newsletter, wrote Monday.  Blockchain data assembled by OKLink appears to show miners starting to sell down their stashes over the past week.  Ethereum miners dumped over 16,000 ETH from Sept. 12 to Sept. 19. (The Merge took effect on Sept. 15.) The decline reduced the miners’ combined balance to about 245,000 ETH, or about $319 million worth.  Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock, attributed the decline in the balances to “miners moving onto other chains.”  They’re “taking profits from their ETH holdings,” he said.  It’s also possible that some miners may have sent some ether to exchanges to handle an “airdrop” of new tokens from a splinter blockchain that aimed to continue on with the Ethereum blockchain’s now-abandoned “proof-of-work” system, Outumuro said. That effort has since mostly fizzled.  Ether’s price had soared in the weeks before the Merge, as some traders also jockeyed for the airdrop, while others speculated that the shift might lead to a surge in institutional investment. But when the Merge actually took place, the cryptocurrency's price suddenly plunged – in what analysts termed a “buy-the-rumor, sell-the-fact” market reaction.  The sell-off also coincided with the runup to this week’s Federal Reserve’s meeting, which included a pledge to aggressive monetary policy that has put downward pressure on risky asset prices, from stocks to cryptocurrencies.  “If miners had accumulated Ethereum at a profit, or they need to pay their electric bill, they would be incentivized to sell at a profit, especially with the expected and actual increased volatility,” said Alexandre Lores, director of blockchain market research at Quantum Economics.  ”For the first time, these miners have no future business relationship with Ethereum,” Lores said  It's possible that miners' move may have contributed to the immediate weakness in prices post-Merge, according to Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer of digital-asset management firm Arca. The ether price was trading around $1,300 Thursday.  It’s not a sure thing that all miners will liquidate their holdings, Dorman said.  “Maybe some [miners] will turn into speculators and hold on for better price,” Dorman said. “Maybe some will turn into stakers and secure the new network, but that [mining] business is over."" The new network relies on ""stakers"" – investors who help to secure the blockchain by ""staking"" their ether – instead of the energy-intensive ""proof-of-work"" mining that Ethereum previously used.  To be sure, the miners’ remaining holdings represent a fraction of the total ETH supply of 119 million, based on CoinDesk data.  Ex-Ethereum miners who choose to continue proof-of-work mining can shift to a different chain. Related altcoins’ prices have seen a significant increase, with Ravencoin (RVN) up 64% and Ethereum Classic's ETC token gaining 75% in the past 90 days.  Chainalysis economist Ethan McMahon said he sees the miner selling as “a temporary shift” in moving away from Ethereum, “if miners’ initial reason for holding Ethereum was for the store-of-value or investment purposes.”",NEGATIVE,ETC,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETC | MARKET | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/22/ethereum-miners-319m-crypto-hoard-hangs-over-market-after-merge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/35300e391b436edd8ed8417879c610cf2580968b-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42393762,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpAmZJ,1663884810,The ETH Merge Did Little to Energize a Tepid NFT Market,"As Ethereum continues its reign as one of the dominant blockchains for launching non-fungible tokens (NFT), some speculated that its milestone transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake last week would help reinvigorate an NFT market that’s been trending downward for the better part of two months. But data shows little movement in either direction despite major improvements to the blockchain’s energy use, speed and scalability.  In the weeks leading up to the Merge, NFT trading decreased overall, and this past week has been just slightly better. One of the industry's top marketplaces, OpenSea, has seen $84 million of volume in the past seven days for Ethereum-based NFTs, a 5.3% increase from the week leading up to the Merge, according to data from DappRadar. The average weekly price for an Ethereum-based NFT on OpenSea stands at $199, a 14.5% decrease from the previous week.  Still, the total number of traders on the platform increased 9% within the past week, totaling 156,000 unique wallets.  Read more: What is the Ethereum Merge?  The lack of appetite for post-Merge NFTs, for some, has come as a surprise, with many traders believing Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake would lure in potential traders previously concerned by exorbitant energy consumption. Salesforce, for example, was scolded by employees who opposed its plans for an NFT cloud platform out of concern for the environmental impact of the technology, despite the fact that the company had emphasized that it would not support proof-of-work blockchains. But post-Merge, there have not been any meaningful conversations about how NFTs on Ethereum are now significantly less taxing on the environment and create fewer emissions.  In addition, concerns about forked NFTs – a worry that NFTs would be duplicated and have one version on the main, new proof-of-stake blockchain as well as a version on the forked ETHPOW chain – have been raised, though no such issues have yet materialized.  A report released by DappRadar on Thursday concluded that Ethereum-based NFTs are operating normally post-merge, and holders won’t need to take any additional actions to ensure normal market functionality. The first NFT minted on Ethereum using proof-of-stake happened 26 minutes after the Merge, and it was purchased for 36 ETH. Bloom, which claims to be the first NFT collection minted in Ethereum’s new proof-of-stake era, also experienced a successful launch.  Zooming out, September 2022 is shaping up to be one of the worst months for NFTs at large since its mania in August 2021. The industry is on pace for under $600 million in total sales for September, a fraction of its $5 billion monthly peak last January, according to data from The Block.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/09/22/the-eth-merge-did-little-to-energize-the-tepid-nft-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/61642461842fdb0bf32fe03e1ef072c6b53bde3f-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The order penalizes the protocol and its founders Tom Bean and Kyle Kistner $250,000 for offering illegal, off-exchange trading of digital assets, registration violations and neglecting to adopt a customer ID program required by the Bank Secrecy Act compliance program.  The CFTC has simultaneously filed a civil enforcement action charging the Ooki DAO, the successor to bZeroX, with violating the same laws as bZeroX. It seeks restitution, disgorgement, civil monetary penalties, trading and registration bans and injunctions against further violations.  “These actions are part of the CFTC’s broader efforts to protect U.S. customers in a rapidly evolving decentralized finance environment,” said Acting Director of Enforcement Gretchen Lowe in a statement. “Margined, leveraged, or financed digital asset trading offered to retail U.S. customers must occur on properly registered and regulated exchanges in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.

The platform currently offers 2.5 million tickets, which are tokenized when purchased and converted into non-fungible tokens called NFTickets, TravelX Chief Blockchain Officer Facundo Martin Diaz told CoinDesk.  After acquiring an NFTicket, a customer can auction, sell, transfer, gift or exchange them through a peer-to-peer system on TravelX, Diaz said.  To purchase tickets on the platform, users can fund the TravelX wallet — which also serves to manage the NFTickets — or pay via Binance Pay. Diaz added that the company is in talks to integrate other exchanges.  TravelX is built on the Algorand blockchain and made its infrastructure open so that other companies – such as exchanges or marketplaces – can use TravelX's APIs to create their own marketplaces.  Within six to 12 months, the platform hopes to incorporate the inventory of more than 60 airlines, with a special focus on Latin American and European operators. In 2023, Diaz said the company will focus more on the U.S. and Middle East.  In November, the company closed a $11 million seed round led by Borderless Capital, said Diaz, who added that it plans to raise a Series A funding round early 2023. The company has 85 employees.  TravelX was founded by Diaz and Juan Pablo Lafosse, who previously founded Almundo.com, a tourism marketplace sold to CVC Corporation for $75 million in 2019.  As of now, the platform allows transactions using the USDC stablecoin and has no plans to incorporate other stablecoins, although it could eventually integrate coins developed by airlines, Diaz added.

42411741,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfXoJ,1663882701,Kraken: How to Get Started on the Crypto Exchange,"Kraken is a centralized crypto exchange co-founded by Jesse Powell and Thanh Luu in 2011, making it one of the oldest exchanges in the space. Powell, who has made headlines for his “anti-woke” workplace stance, recently stepped down as the company’s CEO. Kraken’s current chief operating officer, Dave Ripley, will take over as CEO once someone is hired to fill Ripley's position.  Kraken officially launched its exchange in 2013 and offered bitcoin, litecoin and euro trades. Over the years both its offerings and its clients have grown. Currently, Kraken allows investors to purchase over 100 cryptos and serves 9 million clients in nearly 200 countries.  Since 2013, the exchange has added staking, margin trading and futures, and has announced plans to launch a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace. The exchange offers both a desktop and mobile app for users.  Here’s how to get started on the exchange and some of the key factors that you should consider when deciding if it’s the right exchange for you.  How to sign up on Kraken  The first thing you're going to have to do is create an account. Head over to Kraken.com and click on the sign-in button on the top right-hand corner of the screen.  Follow the sign-up procedure: Add your name, contact details and then click on submit. Once that's done, Kraken will send you an email for you to activate your newly created account and enter the activation code.  After having typed in the activation code you are technically signed up. However, if you want to actually use the exchange service and not just poke around the interface, you're going to have to go through another verification step.  Kraken asks for different levels of verification depending on what services you want to use. The more information you are willing to divulge, the more features you will have access to use. But the more pro you go, the more time it will take to verify your documents. Because you're just getting started, we recommend going through enough of the know-your-customer (KYC) process to get access to the intermediate level (shown below), which will allow you to most of the most-used features.  Once you've verified your account you can start buying and selling crypto on Kraken. Depending on where you live, you can fund your account with fiat deposits via wire or ACH bank transfers, credit card or with crypto by transferring from another exchange.  Kraken’s pros  When trying something new, it's always good to take a positive approach before dishing the dirt, so let's begin by looking at some of the pros of Kraken's platform.  Easy to navigate  The most important thing about any platform, app or program is its simplicity and ease of use. Kraken's design makes it very intuitive to navigate the exchange platform for the first time.  Clean and simple, the headline and its ribbons are easy to find and understand. Whether it's the prices of the various cryptos Kraken has to offer or its learn content that will help you get up to scratch with your crypto knowledge, everything can be accessed from the central dashboard.  One of the more tricky things to do when starting out on a new exchange is to make a deposit. Kraken makes sure you can easily generate an address to which you can deposit funds on the platform.  Affordable fees  Like most exchanges, Kraken charges you fees for buying cryptocurrency. There are two ways to buy cryptos: Kraken Pro or Instant Buy. If you're just starting out, the Instant Buy method is the easiest to use.  For the easiest way to purchase crypto, you can do cash-to-crypto and crypto-to-crypto transactions. However, you will pay a 0.9% fee if you buy stablecoins with another stablecoin and up 1.5% if you purchase a stablecoin with non-stablecoin crypto.  When transferring money from your bank account to Kraken's exchange you will also be subject to fees. If you moved $100 to Kraken, you would end up with $98 worth of crypto as opposed to the $100 you transferred.  That being said, Kraken still has lower-than-average fees for ots most basic transfer option when compared with other exchanges such as Coinbase.  Security  If security is a top priority, Kraken will meet your needs. It offers a solid verification process, two-factor authentication and a global time lock setting for when you're away from the platform.  Kraken has also started to conduct proof of reserve audits, an industry-leading step to help verify investors' balances. So far, BTC, ETH, USDT, USDC, XRP, ADA and DOT, which account for 63% of holdings, are audited.  Kraken also says that 95% of its deposits are held offline in cold storage. The company also claims that its service is monitored around the clock by guards and technological surveillance tools.  Kraken's cons  Despite all the pros, Kraken is not infallible. There are cons that could make it not a fit for your needs.  Availability  The key area Kraken could improve upon is its availability in different jurisdictions. For instance, investors residing in New York and Washington state in the U.S. cannot access Kraken's platform. In Germany and the U.K., traders cannot use off-chain staking.  This, of course, narrows Kraken's reach and means that investors should check if they can access Kraken's services in their countries.  A lack of service to certain areas is a serious con if you are in one of those areas.  Verification is a lengthy process  Having opened a new account and gone through the process of verifying from start to finish, the time taken to get fully verified is not insignificant. Although Kraken states how long each step should take, realistically it takes longer than estimated.

42373743,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvV5Gx,1663880855,Push to Enhance CFTC’s Crypto Watchdog Role Gets a Boost in US Congress,"Congress’ attempt to make the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) the primary U.S. cryptocurrency regulator took a procedural step forward on Thursday, with a House of Representatives lawmaker introducing a bill supporting a parallel effort in the Senate.  The Senate legislation – introduced in August by the leaders of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and senior Republican, John Boozman (R-Ark.) – is a relatively narrow effort to install the CFTC as a leading agency to oversee digital assets trading and to exercise new authority over crypto spot markets. Now, that effort has been joined in the House, shepherded by Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.), the chairman of the Commodity Exchanges, Energy, and Credit Subcommittee and also the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.  “It is essential that we have robust oversight and regulation so that we may provide strong customer protections,” said Maloney, who introduced the bill along with Stacey Plaskett, a Democratic delegate from the U.S. Virgin Islands who is also on the committee.  The Stabenow-Boozman bill has already been through a hearing in their committee last week. When the lawmakers introduced it they underlined how serious they were about trying to get the bill across the finish line. To that end, they focused the language in such a way that it could be done in their single committee, though that decision limited the members from making more comprehensive decisions about defining distinctions between crypto commodities and securities.  It’s unclear whether the Senate legislation will have enough runway in this dwindling congressional session to get to an overall floor vote, and Maloney’s bill would similarly need approval from the House Agriculture Committee and the overall House before the bills can unite and face White House consideration. The advantage of having matching bills in both chambers is that it could streamline the process and get to the president’s desk more quickly if they win support in the Senate and House.  The House has already had a similar bill from Republicans on its agriculture committee, the Digital Commodity Exchange Act, but it hasn’t budged in months.  While lawmakers debate their approach, CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam is already preparing his agency to become a top crypto regulator, getting his staff organized as the “right regulator” for the industry. The agency would get a flood of new funding through industry fees authorized in the legislation, and Behnam said it would cost the CFTC $112 million in the first three years to get up to speed.",POSITIVE,없음,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/22/push-to-enhance-cftcs-crypto-watchdog-role-gets-a-boost-in-us-congress,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ae8e8812f3d2abab8985433b8933454262e84a15-1037x778.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42373759,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvV5Un,1663880306,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Holds Over $19K, Continues Wild Ride","Price Action  Bitcoin pushed higher on Wednesday, reversing course after a roller coaster day of trading on Thursday.  Bitcoin’s (BTC) rose 4.5% on Thursday, following a 2% decline on Wednesday. The relatively mild 2% Wednesday loss obscures a wild ride as bitcoin traded in a $1,600 range (8% of the current price) over approximately six hours. As markets digested the totality of Tuesday’s interest rate increase, initial optimism related to the hike only being 75 basis points yielded to the reality of the Federal Reserve’s increasingly hawkish long-term outlook.  Ether (ETH) rose 6.9%, trading in concert with bitcoin and surpassing the $1,300 mark. Despite the differences between the two assets, ether is still highly correlated to bitcoin. Following the increase in interest rates, ETH prices ranged from a high of $1,407 to a low of 1,218, a $189 swing that equates to 14% of current ETH prices.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures performance across a basket of cryptocurrencies, rose 3%.  Economic Calendar: The U.K.’s central bank took the interest rate stage Thursday, raising its key interest rate by 50 basis points. This marks its seventh consecutive rate hike and pushed U.K. borrowing costs to a 14-year high.  Countries worldwide are in a phase of aggressive monetary tightening policy; the central banks of Canada, Switzerland and the eurozone have recently taken similar actions.  The broader concern is the extent to which restrictive monetary policy suppresses economic output, which is likely to have a negative impact on the prices of risk assets like bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  U.S. Equities: Traditional equities declined, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), tech-heavy Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 down 0.4%, 1.4% and 0.8%, respectively.  Commodities: WTI crude oil rose 0.8% while natural gas fell 7%. European Brent crude increased 0.8%, while gasoline (RBOB) rose 1.5%. In metals, traditional safe haven gold rose 0.4%, while copper futures increased 0.09%.  The Dollar Index (DXY) was relatively flat, declining 0.04%.

Technical Take  Bitcoin indicators don’t paint a rosy picture yet  Technical indicators aren’t giving those investors long bitcoin a lot to be excited about.  Bitcoin’s 10-day exponential moving average (EMA) crossed below its 20-day EMA. Measuring the RSI (Relative Strength Index) between the negative candle on Sept. 13 to the negative candle on Sept. 21 implies a bearish confirmation, highlighted by increased volume into the 18% price decline.  “Candle” refers to the representation of an asset’s open, high, low and closing price on a given day. The RSI is a technical indicator that measures price momentum. An increase in negative trading volume following a greater than 10% decrease in price implies that bearish sentiment of an asset remains.  In a bearish confirmation, both price and RSI slope downward in tandem. Should the RSI slope begin to flatten as prices decline, that is an indication that the downturn is weakening.  There are early signs this is occurring, as Thursday’s RSI is up slightly. Its overall value of 40, however, implies that BTC is fairly priced at the moment.  On-chain metrics show that potential room to the downside still exists. The percentage of unique BTC averages in profit has fallen to 52.05%, per blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.  The metric reached a 2022 peak of 82% in March, when BTC was trading near $48,000. The lowest the metric has reached in recent history was 41% in March 2020, when BTC was trading at $5,000. Still, at the current 52% level, it's beginning to approach the sub-50% range, where BTC would be considered oversold.  The supply of BTC held by addresses with a balance between 1,000 and 10,000 coins has dropped 8% since this February, and 12% since its peak in February 2021. Those coins are likely being absorbed by smaller investors as supplies for addresses holding less than 1,000 BTC have increased over the identical time period.  On a more promising, on-chain note, “Whale Net Volume” on exchanges has turned negative, signaling that addresses that hold 1,000 or more coins are moving coins off centralized exchanges. The significance of this trend is that large deposits onto exchanges often signal that investors are looking to sell bitcoin.

The company filed for Chapter 11 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas and owed as much as $500 million to at least 200 creditors, according to a filing.  Compute North in February announced a capital raise of $385 million, consisting of an $85 million Series C equity round and $300 million in debt financing. But it fell into bankruptcy as miners struggle to survive amid slumping bitcoin (BTC) prices, rising power costs and record difficulty in mining bitcoin. The filing is likely to have negative implications for the industry. Compute North is one of the largest data center providers for miners, and has multiple deals with other larger mining companies.

CEO Dave Perrill stepped down earlier this month but will continue to serve on the board, the spokesperson added. Drake Harvey, who has been chief operating officer for the last year, has taken the role of president at Compute North, the spokesperson said.  Compute North has four facilities in the U.S. – two in Texas and one in both South Dakota and Nebraska, according to its website.  Some of the company's partners include Marathon Digital (MARA), where Compute North has brought online 40 megawatts (MW) of a 280MW wind-powered facility at its Upton County in West Texas. Bitcoin mining hosting and brokerage services firm Compass Mining also said recently that it will work with Compute North on a 75MW hosting partnership for its Granbury, Texas, data center. Compass said in a tweet that it's reviewing the bankruptcy petitions and Compute North has informed the company that the filing shouldn't disrupt mining operations.  Marathon also tweeted that the bankruptcy protection filings won't affect its current mining operations and its in communication with Compute North.  Meanwhile, crypto miner Hive Blockchain (HIVE) also entered into a deal with Compute North on March 7, for 100MW worth of mining capacity. Shares of Marathon were down slightly in post-market trading on Thursday, while Hive remained unchanged.  However, Hive decided to back out of the deal with Compute North, after seeing risk of higher power costs in Texas, president and chief operating officer, Aydin Kilic, told CoinDesk. ""In doing our due diligence on the mining ecosystem in Texas, we saw the risk of rising power costs as well as the delays on the energization of new projects due to the new approval process required by ERCOT,"" Kilic said. ""While HIVE did travel to Texas on numerous occasions this year to explore business development, including to conduct technical diligence by visiting a Compute North operating Tier0 data center site, definitive agreements were not entered into, and HIVE currently operates in Canada, Sweden and Iceland,"" he added.  Additional deals that Compute North signed included Singapore-based Atlas Mining, Chinese Crypto Miner The9, bitcoin miner BitNile Holdings (NILE), Bit Digital (BTBT) and Sphere 3D (ANY). Shares of BitNile was down about 1% in after-hours trading, while Bit Digital rose slightly.  On July 14, Celsius Network's mining unit, which said in March it planned to go public, also filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, along with its parent company, in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. Meanwhile, Poolin Wallet, the wallet service of one of the largest bitcoin (BTC) mining pools, has announced on Sept. 13 it will issue IOU (I Owe You) tokens to affected customers after it froze withdrawals prior week.

42393772,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpAnYr,1663879046,Cardano’s Vasil Upgrade Marks an Important Milestone in the Blockchain’s Evolution,"The average crypto watcher, aware that Ethereum has just completed its long-awaited transition to a proof-of-stake validating system, may be wondering what the overall takeaway is from the Vasil hard fork upgrade on the Cardano blockchain that happened at 21:44 UTC on Thursday, Sept. 22. I(t is expected to finalize in five days, on Sept. 27.)  The significance of Vasil’s rather technical set of changes, which improve the ledger’s programmability and its throughput potential, perhaps requires some zooming out to view a bigger picture.  Read more: What Cardano’s Highly Anticipated Vasil Hard Fork Will Bring  Cardano, sometimes touted as an “Ethereum killer,” is playing a long game. Critics of this process (split into “eras” named after Romantic poets, computer scientists and Enlightenment thinkers) often criticize the protocol for lagging behind other smart contract blockchains that already host thriving decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems and have amassed billions of dollars in total value locked.  But the early achievements of the foremost smart contract platform, Ethereum, are “brilliant but unstructured,” according to Aggelos Kiayias, chief scientist at Cardano builder Input Output Global (IOG). Smart contracts on Cardano are “different,” says Kiayias, who is also a professor in cryptography at the University of Edinburgh.  Smart contracts on Cardano  This is because Cardano is grounded in functional programming, a precise and mathematical way to write code that uses immutable data to tell the program exactly what to do, as opposed to achieving results through objects that alter a program’s state.  “I think many people had difficulties when smart contracts were launched in Cardano because they were hoping there would be a simple way to immediately port complex contracts from Ethereum to Cardano,” Kiayias said in an interview with CoinDesk. “But it requires a familiarity with functional programming and having to rethink, what would be the best way to program things in this new environment?”  For Kiayias, not only is functional programming a simple and natural approach to take, but when it comes to critical infrastructure it makes perfect sense. That’s because the intent of a computer program then becomes very clear and easy to verify. This simplicity also invites the possible automation of that verification. And while some investment of time is required, Kiayias said the intricacies of Cardano’s functional-based Plutus script can be simplified using domain-specific languages such as Marlowe.  Cardano is not the only blockchain to prize formal verification of smart contracts; the Tezos blockchain was also designed with this in mind. These days, however, such concerns may have fallen out of fashion amid the breathless rush of DeFi.  Bitcoin in the blood  Another fundamental difference between Cardano and most other layer one smart contract chains is its choice to use a design borrowed from Bitcoin.  Unlike Ethereum, which uses an account-based model rather like a bank’s, Cardano is based on the “unspent transaction output” (UTXO) system, a way of calculating what’s held in bitcoin wallets by keeping tabs on the change left over when fractions of coins are spent. But Cardano extends this practice so it’s not constrained by the Bitcoin blockchain’s data limits, an approach known as “extended unspent transaction outputs” (EUTXO).  This design was a natural fit for a deterministic functional approach and comes with important advantages, explained Kiayias.  “Either a transaction fits the current extended UTXO set and spends some UTXOs and introduces others, or it doesn’t fit,” he said. “So I have this deterministic assurance with how my transaction is going to interact with the blockchain state and not be modified by any other transactions.”  This is not the case for an account-based model like Ethereum, Kiayias pointed out. “In this case, I cannot fully predict how my transaction is going to interact with the blockchain state because other transactions can be ‘sandwiched’ before my transaction, modifying it, and then my transaction is basically engaging with a state that did not exist when I issued it. This actually makes a huge difference for smart contracts.”  Security at scale  Tying this back to the changes being implemented by Vasil, Cardano’s UTXO model will be more easily referred to, keeping more load off the chain, which is better for scaling and is also preferable from a security perspective.  “The Vasil upgrade will make it feasible to refer to UTXOs, and there’s substantial space savings because of that,” Kiayias said. “So while in theory it’s a small bookkeeping consideration, it’s a huge advantage in practice.”  Kiayias said it’s nothing new in the world of technology to see people rushing forward, which has arguably turned DeFi into a kind of hacker’s playground.  “If I want to improve usability or speed, I can always do better than you by sacrificing security,” Kiayias said, defending Cardano’s methodical approach and painstaking process of academic peer review.  “But I think we always need a scientific way of assessing the security of systems,” he added.  Cardano's native cryptocurrency, ADA, is up around 4% over the past 24 hours, trading at 46 cents at time of publication.

In these main sentiments, there are two zones that have historically been particularly important for prices of coins like Bitcoin. These are the &apos;extreme greed&apos; and &apos;extreme fear&apos; regions and they occur at values greater than 75 and below 25, respectively.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) says James Wolfgramm, 43, of Spanish Fork, Utah, wooed his victims by portraying himself on social media as “a multimillionaire who made his fortune in cryptocurrency.” Indeed, Wolfgramm’s Twitter account, which has 10 followers, declares him to be “one of the most well-known entrepreneurs on the planet” and a “financial advisor that helps more than 10,000 clients each year.”  Wolfgramm is accused by the Justice Department of using images of crypto wallets holding millions of dollars worth of digital assets, a suitcase full of cash and expensive sports cars to lure victims with his supposed investing acumen.  Through one of Wolfgramm’s companies, Bitex, authorities say he convinced two investors to give him $1.7 million by “purporting to sell a high-powered cryptocurrency mining machine – the ‘Bitex Blockbuster’ – that did not actually exist.” Instead, according to the DOJ statement, Wolfgramm used a fake machine in Bitex’s Utah office, which was connected to a monitor that “displayed a pre-recorded loop that simply gave the appearance of mining activity.”  Another one of Wolfgramm’s businesses, Ohana Capital Financial (OCF), allegedly offered financial services to companies that could not get traditional bank accounts, marketed with the slogan “Banking the Unbankable.” Wolfgramm supposedly told investors that OCF had a board of advisers and that customer funds were bonded, when, in reality, he was spending millions of dollars of customer money on “unrelated business expenses.”  Wolfgramm is also accused of a third financial scheme in which he allegedly agreed to purchase an indoor soccer complex outside of Salt Lake City for $15 million. He claimed to have taken possession of the property and began collecting money from customers without ever making a payment to the seller on the sales contract.

42373749,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvV5Lz,1663865730,Celsius Network Might Be Planning to Turn Its Debt Into Crypto ‘IOU’ Tokens,"Bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network appears to be considering a plan to turn its debt into crypto “IOU” (“I Owe You”) tokens.  Celsius filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July, a month after halting withdrawals because of a liquidity crisis it blamed on “extreme market conditions.” Subsequent bankruptcy proceedings in the Southern District of New York have revealed the depths of Celsius’ financial troubles: The lender owes 500,000 creditors nearly $5 billion.  Even if Celsius sold all of its assets – including its mysterious, half-finished mining subsidiary, Celsius Mining that Celsius’ executives and bankruptcy lawyers have pinned their hopes on to get out of debt – it would still be left with a $1.2 billion hole in its balance sheet.  Instead, a leaked audio recording of an internal Celsius meeting – shared by Celsius customer and YouTuber Tiffany Fong – indicates that Celsius is considering an alternative method for repaying customers: wrapping the bitcoin, ether and USDC it owes customers into a token that, as Celsius co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Nuke Goldstein explains, “represents the ratio between how much we really owe and how much we really have.”  Customers could then either redeem the wrapped “IOU tokens” (though a timeline for these redemptions remains unclear), trade them on the open market or hold them to speculate on Celsius’ potential recovery in the long term.  In another leaked call shared by Fong, Celsius executives told employees at an all-hands meeting on Sept. 8 that Celsius’ CEO Alex Mashinsky had already shared the plan to issue the IOU tokens with the unsecured creditors committee, which reacted with “positive feedback.”  “This is really how we resolve this, how we get out,” Oren Blonstein, Celsius’ chief compliance officer, told employees at the meeting. “What we do in this pivotal moment can be through unprecedented, really innovative solutions and this [plan] is one of them.”  The plan, if accepted by the unsecured creditors committee, however, wouldn’t exactly be unprecedented.  Liquidity-strapped Chinese mining pool operator Poolin suspended withdrawals from its wallet service earlier this month. A week later, it announced that it would issue IOU tokens to affected customers representing a 1:1 ratio of user balances across six cryptocurrencies.  The plan also bears some resemblance to Bitfinex’s recovery plan following a hack that drained 120,000 bitcoins (BTC) from the exchange’s reserves in mid-2016. The exchange issued debt tokens to customers affected by the hack, which were then traded on the open market – often for much less than their $1 face value. By April 2017, Bitfinex had bought back all of its remaining debt tokens.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/09/22/celsius-might-be-planning-to-turn-its-debt-into-crypto-iou-tokens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dae7c8989f23d5825aaf6aac7d74736d4a94ad0c-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411732,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfXNr,1663864986,What Is Ethereum?,"Ethereum is a blockchain-based software platform that supports the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization after Bitcoin. Like other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum can be used for sending and receiving value globally and without a third party watching or stepping in unexpectedly.  Value exchange is the main use case of the Ethereum blockchain today, often via the blockchain’s native token, ether. But many of the developers are working on the cryptocurrency because of its long-term potential and the ambitious vision of its developers to use Ethereum to give users more control of their finances and online data. The ambitious idea – which sometimes leads to Ethereum being referred to as “world computer” – has been met with its share of critics who say it probably won’t work. But if this experiment rolls out as planned, it would spawn apps very different from Facebook and Google, which users knowingly or unknowingly trust with their data.  Ethereum enthusiasts aim to hand control back to users with the help of a blockchain, a technology that decentralizes data so that thousands of people around the world are handed a copy. Developers can use Ethereum to build leaderless applications, which means that a user’s data cannot be tampered with by the service’s creators.  Ethereum was first proposed in 2013 by developer Vitalik Buterin, who was 19 at the time, and was one of the pioneers of the idea of expanding the technology behind Bitcoin, blockchain, to more use cases than transactions.  While Bitcoin was created with the goal of disrupting online banking and day-to-day transactions, Ethereum’s creators aim to use the same technology to replace internet third parties – those that store data, transfer mortgages and keep track of complex financial instruments. These apps aid people in innumerable ways, such as paving a way to share vacation photos with friends on social media. But they have been accused of abusing this control by censoring data or accidentally spilling sensitive user data in hacks, to name a couple of examples.  The platform officially launched in 2015, turning the idea of Ethereum into a real, functioning network.  Ethereum and a decentralized internet  Before you can understand Ethereum, it helps to first understand intermediaries.  Today intermediaries are everywherehttps://imgflip.com/i/4e5oef. Behind the scenes, they help us accomplish all sorts of digital tasks. Gmail for instance helps us send emails. Venmo helps us send $10 to a friend.  This means that our personal data, financial information, and so forth are all largely stored on other people’s computers – in clouds and servers owned by companies like Facebook, Google or PayPal. Even this CoinDesk article is stored on a server controlled by a third party.  This structure can be problematic, according to decentralization advocates. It means less direct control for users, and it also opens up opportunities for censorship, where the intermediary can step in and prevent a user from any action, whether buy a certain stock or post a certain message on social media, or block them altogether.  The idea of Ethereum is to change how apps on the internet work today, awarding users more control by replacing intermediaries with smart contracts that execute rules automatically.  Many, including inventors of the internet, believe the internet was always meant to be decentralized, and a splintered movement has sprung up around using new tools to help achieve this goal. Ethereum is one of the technologies to join this movement.  Ethereum FAQ  How is Ethereum different from Bitcoin?  Ethereum draws inspiration from Bitcoin. They are both cryptocurrencies. Ethereum uses the same technology behind Bitcoin, a blockchain, which uses a shared, decentralized public ledger to decentralize the network so it’s not under the control of just one entity.  But while Bitcoin is used primarily as a store of value, the idea behind Ethereum is to decentralize other kinds of applications and services, from social media networks to more complex financial agreements.  Why is Ethereum sometimes called a ‘world computer?’  Many advocates see Ethereum as a “world computer” that could decentralize the internet.  With Ethereum, centralized servers are replaced by thousands of so-called “nodes” run by volunteers all over the world thus forming a “world computer.” The hope is that one day, anyone in the world will be able to use it.  How does an Ethereum app work?  Scrolling through a typical app store you’ll see a variety of colorful squares representing everything from banking to fitness to messaging apps. The long-term vision of the Ethereum community is to make apps that look just like these, but that work differently under the hood.  In short, the goal is for Ethereum apps to return control of the data in these types of services to its owner.  The apps built on Ethereum that offer this functionality are known as decentralized apps. Users need ether, Ethereum’s native token, to use them.  What are the next steps for Ethereum?  A huge upgrade to the Ethereum known as ""the Merge"" was officially completed on Sept. 15, 2022, moving the blockchain from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake for its consensus mechanism. The project took years to accomplish and reduced Ethereum's energy consumption by over 99%.  This isn't the end of the journey however. Ethereum's relatively high fees and slow speeds, are the next challenges for the blockchain to address. Neither of these issues were addressed by the update and remain a blocker to expanded adoption.

42422296,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0jbfh,1663862774,"UK Introduces Law to Seize, Freeze and Recover Crypto","The U.K. introduced a bill to make it easier for law enforcement agencies to seize, freeze and recover crypto assets when used for criminal activities such as money laundering, drugs and cybercrime, the government said Thursday.  The 250-page Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency bill, first promised in May, was introduced by the Home Office, Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, Serious Fraud Office and Treasury and covers more than just crypto. It had its first reading in the House of Commons on Thursday, with the second reading scheduled for Oct. 13.  ""Domestic and international criminals have for years laundered the proceeds of their crime and corruption by abusing U.K. company structures, and are increasingly using cryptocurrencies,"" Graeme Biggar, director general of the National Crime Agency, said in the statement. ""These reforms – long awaited and much welcomed – will help us crack down on both.""  Even without the bill, the authorities have not been powerless. London's Metropolitan Police seized a record 180 million British pounds (US$200 million) of crypto linked to international money laundering in July of last year following a 114 million-pound haul in June, the BBC reported.  The bill is designed to build on the earlier Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Act that helped regulators place sanctions against Russia and freeze relevant assets in the country. Regulators have been concerned that some Russians have been using crypto to avoid sanctions imposed following the invasion of Ukraine.  Earlier this month, the Treasury updated guidance so that crypto exchanges and wallet providers reported suspected sanction breaches, following the example of other nations. The U.S. and the European Union also clarified that their sanction rules extend to crypto.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | REGULATION,Camomile Shumba,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/22/uk-introduces-law-to-seize-freeze-and-recover-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c5233fd6fe1df1f3541430cf6488448036287b7c-2880x2160.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42422308,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0jbzh,1663862700,Here’s What’s In the White House’s Crypto Reports,"The White House published a number of reports filed by federal departments in response to President Joe Biden’s executive order on crypto. I read through the nearly 300 pages so you don’t have to. What follows are the highlights.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  The narrative  We’re starting to see some real results from U.S. President Joe Biden’s executive order on crypto, which he signed in March. The White House, Treasury, Commerce and Justice departments published a total of seven documents on Friday in response to the order, looking at everything from crypto’s role in illicit finance to analyzing the different considerations around a central bank digital currency.  Why it matters  The reports came out more or less simultaneously. Reporters were able to join a press call previewing some of the reports, but they were all live by Friday.  At first glance, these reports seem to be interesting but not especially promising in terms of concrete action. They’re largely summaries of past events, analyses of ongoing research or recommendations for future action with no timeline or commitment. However, this does indicate real progress in terms of how the federal government is approaching cryptocurrencies and regulation. The curious emphasis on central bank digital currencies (CBDC) aside, there is a lot that the crypto industry should be paying attention to in the different reports.  Breaking it down  There is a lot to unpack in the reports published last week. I’m just going to take them in turn, highlighting whatever sticks out to me in particular.  White House Fact Sheet:  The White House published what it described as the “first-ever comprehensive framework for responsible development of digital assets.” As others have pointed out, the term “framework” is perhaps a bit generous; it’s full of hedges and “will considers,” rather than any specific concrete actions that we can see the administration take.  That being said, there are a lot of tidbits that, if the White House does follow through, will dramatically reshape how crypto companies operate in the U.S.  The biggest thing to me, and we’ll revisit this in one of the Treasury reports, is the idea that the U.S. would consider a “federal framework to regulate nonbank payment providers.”  Depending on whether or not crypto exchanges are nonbank payment providers, this clause could hint that there may soon be a federal regulatory framework. One long-running hope for the industry is that the U.S. might adopt a framework that would allow crypto companies to seek a federal license allowing them to provide services nationwide, rather than having to seek 49 different state licenses to operate in that state alone.  To its credit, the fact sheet does provide a comprehensive view at the different issues the Biden administration is considering, and does lay out what the different federal agencies are expected to do in future.  The U.S. Department of Justice:  The Justice Department has a clear, enforcement-focused view in its report. The first part looks at crypto’s role in illicit finance, noting that “cryptocurrency is also the payment method of choice for ransomware and other digital extortion activities.” Crypto is also used by terrorists, though to a lesser extent than traditional financial tools. There's not a lot that’s new here. It’s mostly just recapping for those who don’t follow Justice’s activities in the crypto space.  Part of the report continues in this vein, analyzing crypto’s use in various criminal activity types and contrasting to fiat use. The Drug Enforcement Agency, U.S. Marshals Service, Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Secret Service have all played roles, according to the report.  The more notable aspect may be the “Digital Asset Coordinators” network (or DAC), a group of 150 federal prosecutors nationwide who will specialize in crypto crimes.  “The report also addresses the Executive Order’s request for recommendations on appropriate regulatory and legislative actions. It proposes actions designed to enhance law enforcement’s ability to gather evidence and initiate prosecutions; strengthen certain laws and penalty provisions that play an important role in digital asset prosecutions; support regulations that would enhance customer-identification efforts and other anti-money-laundering requirements under the Bank Secrecy Act; and ensure that law enforcement and regulatory agencies have adequate resources to conduct the technologically sophisticated investigations inherent in the digital assets space,” an accompanying press release said.  Justice is recommending three proposals: applying a law that prohibits financial institution employees from “tipping off suspects to ongoing investigations” to crypto companies; strengthening laws making it illegal to operate an unlicensed money transmitter; and lengthening the statute of limitations for certain crypto crimes.  U.S. Department of Commerce:  The Commerce Department’s report purportedly looked at how the U.S. could remain competitive in the digital asset sector. Broadly, its conclusions call for “effective regulatory approaches,” international and public-private engagement, and more technological research and development.  “To that end, federal departments and agencies should continue to engage internationally to promote development of digital asset policies and CBDC technologies consistent with U.S. values and standards. Where relevant and appropriate, Commerce and other federal departments and agencies may promote U.S. digital asset businesses and their products and solution” the report said.  The document goes on to say that the Commerce Department could support educational initiatives, particularly in “minority-serving institutions.” The report also suggests that “fostering a skilled workforce” would benefit the U.S.  In a statement, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said, “The framework offers a path forward to promote U.S. competitiveness, responsible innovation and leadership in digital assets. I look forward to engaging with government partners, industry, consumer groups, universities and civil society as we implement the framework.”  U.S. Treasury Department’s ‘Future of Money’ paper:  The U.S. Treasury Department published three reports. One looked at “the future of money” broadly, but a good chunk of the report focused on the idea of a central bank digital currency.  There are various policy design choices to keep in mind, the report said, looking at the role it might play in the payment system, what role intermediaries might play and whether the CBDC should be a wholesale or retail tool. The report does not make any recommendations as to whether any given set of characteristics would be superior to others (the report does recommend that the U.S. government continue researching a possible CBDC in case the creation of one is deemed to be “in the national interest”).  The report also recommended boosting work on real-time payment systems.  The most interesting aspect, to me anyway, is the revisiting of the possible federal framework for nonbank payments providers.  Read more: Digital Dollar Likely Won't Be Part of Retail Banking World, US Lawmaker Says  “Nonbanks are increasingly providing payment services, including issuing money (or money-like) liabilities and processing payments. On the one hand, participation by nonbank payments companies may contribute to higher levels of competition, inclusion, and innovation. On the other, if these firms are not adequately regulated and supervised, there may be risks to consumers, the financial system, and the broader economy,” the report said.  The report does not explicitly say that these nonbank payment providers are crypto exchanges, but it does note that current providers are largely regulated at the state level.  This state-level regulation does not address run or payments risks, the report said.  If such a framework is developed, it could help these nonbank payment providers act as intermediaries for a U.S. CBDC, the report hinted.  White House Office of Science and Technology Policy:  The White House science office, which made waves earlier this month by daring to criticize aspects of the crypto mining industry’s energy use, published a report on some of the technical considerations for a digital dollar.  One of the more interesting notes is that the report says a technical design choice “does not presuppose” that a CBDC would use a distributed ledger.  Like the Treasury report, the science office report evaluates different technical possibilities for a CBDC, and how these different technical bases might impact compliance with anti-money laundering laws or interoperability.  It does take a strong stance on data privacy, saying that “sensitive data should be private.”  “The CBDC system should maintain privacy and protect against arbitrary or unlawful surveillance,” the report said. “The CBDC design, deployment and maintenance should adhere to privacy engineering and risk management best practices, including privacy by design and disassociability. Built-in protections and design choices should ensure that privacy is included by default, including ensuring that data collection conforms to reasonable expectations and only data that is strictly necessary for advancing CBDC system policy objectives is collected.”  In a blog post published with the paper, White House officials said the science office and the National Science Foundation are creating a digital assets research and development agenda to study cryptography and other issues which may support a future CBDC.  U.S. Treasury Department’s Action Plan on Illicit Financing:  The Treasury Department’s second report, like Justice’s, looked at some of the criminal activity that involved cryptocurrencies, similarly highlighting ransomware as a major illicit use.  Some ransomware perpetrators are going so far as to ask for privacy coins rather than bitcoin, which is more easily traceable and recoverable, the report said.  Read more: US Treasury Wants Public to Comment on Crypto’s Role in Illicit Finance  The report lists seven “priority actions,” including monitoring possible threats, boosting the global anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFTC) laws, updating the Bank Secrecy Act, engaging with the private sector and other recommendations.  U.S. Treasury Department’s report on consumer considerations:  The Treasury also analyzed what cryptos might mean for the general American public – “consumers, investors and businesses.”  The current primary use case is to trade, lend or borrow other cryptos, with limited other activities at the present, the report said, though it acknowledged that there may be future activities.  This report’s recommendations were similar in tone to the others: It called for supervisory guidance or rules, “comprehensive oversight” and said the Financial Literacy and Education Commission should work to present clear information about cryptocurrencies to the public, in an effort to tamp down on frauds and scams.  Miscellaneous:  Decentralized finance (DeFi) came up quite a few times, but nothing especially out of the ordinary.

Lit aims to give individuals agency within Web3 ecosystems by giving users a private key that is interoperable across decentralized finance (DeFi), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and non-fungible tokens (NFT) on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), Cosmos and Solana chains. Lit protocol founder David Sneider said users will have greater security and autonomy over their data and digital assets.  The demand for cross-chain interoperability has been on the rise this past year. In August, several Solana-based projects teamed up to create the Open Chat Alliance, an interoperable messaging platform. In April, decentralized social graph protocol CyberConnect raised $15 million to build out a platform to make data interoperable across platforms.  Lit is continuing to make strides in the crypto space by releasing Programmable Key Pairs, a feature that works with its encryption service to help users custody their own keys to build interoperable apps. “We're starting to see applications and imagine a future where you have automated agents as it relates to how your data and finances are treated, ” said Sneider.

42421437,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoMOr,1663861969,Why Devcon 7 Should Be in Istanbul,"Devcon, the most important event for Ethereum developers and researchers, might well be in Istanbul next year. If it happens, it would be thanks to a campaign from the Turkish cryptocurrency community, which has evolved into a truly powerful community.  This year's Devcon will be held in Bogota, Colombia, in October, but the organizers have already started thinking about next year’s destination. A recent survey on the Devcon forum received seven suggestions so far. A couple of young Turks proposed Istanbul as a candidate and received huge support: The volume of comments and views in favor of the proposal is far ahead of the next candidate, Nha Trang City, Vietnam.  Turan Sert is a tech entrepreneur and financial writer with a focus on Web 3. He currently acts as an adviser to BlockchainIST Center and Paribu, both based in Turkey.  Leading figures in the Turkish crypto community have already established an informal committee to organize what could be the most important crypto event in the country’s history.  Why Istanbul?  Recent market research suggests 8 million Turks are holding crypto assets. High inflation (80% year over year) and devaluation of local currency Turkish lira (126% year over year against the U.S. dollar) are among key reasons why Turks are seeking alternative investments that hold their value. While foreign currencies and gold have historically been prominent tools to hedge against inflation, cryptocurrencies have emerged as a popular option, which led the International Monetary Fund to coin the term “cryptoization” in its “Global Stability Report” released last October.  There are plenty of non-crypto reasons for choosing Istanbul for Devcon 2023. Easy access is one (almost 600 direct flights from 117 countries to Istanbul daily, with either no visa required or available at the entrance for most visitors). Proximity to Europe and Asia is another. Meanwhile, the city has safe and affordable neighborhoods with lots of attractive venues.  These are all valid points but there has to be more than that for organizers to select a city. They will wonder: Is there an active crypto community and would organizing a conference here make a difference in that community?  See also: Devcon 1: Ethereum's Woodstock Moment - CoinDesk  In Turkey, the developer community has always been relatively small compared to crypto asset holders but it is growing rapidly with university students taking the lead. The country has one of the youngest populations in the world – (almost half of the population is younger than 30) of which 8.4 million are enrolled in higher education. How about crypto interest? In our latest count, there were 41 university blockchain clubs with hundreds of members (a leading one, ITU Blockchain, has roughly about 2500 volunteers alone). When I was appointed as an advisor to BlockchainIST, the first university blockchain research center in Istanbul, a couple of years ago, this number was less than 10.  Why such a dramatic increase? I asked several blockchain clubs and they came back with similar response.  The appetite for growth  First of all, there is a growing appetite among the new generation for integration into global markets. Digital opportunities with blockchain projects are among key avenues to fulfill this dream. But visa requirements and the recent devaluation of Turkish lira against all major currencies have effectively made it almost impossible for young people to move out of the country, either for pleasure or work.  Despite this, students have started to attend global events since restrictions due to COVID-19 pandemic were lifted. Following a local hackathon last December, 10 or so students from three different university clubs joined Avalanche Barcelona Summit. Soon after, small groups managed to travel to ETHAmsterdam, ETHPrague, ETHBarcelona, ETHCC 5, Eth Mexico City and lastly ETHBerlin. A group of 10 students is planning to attend Devcon Bogota as well. Those were all made possible by scholarships granted by organizers, local businesses (such as LykaDAO and Paribu) as well as global players (such as Aave and Talent House).  Several local initiatives have sparked the interest in the local community as well. First, several hackathons, including AvalancheHacks, NFT and Metaverse Hackhaton and Blockcircus. Several and student club organizations such as Blockchain and Beyond Summit and Blockchain Networking Day attracted significant crowds. Several corporate events namely Blockchain Economy Summit, NFT Summit, Eurasia Blockchain Summit, Kriptofest, Istanbul Blockchain Week all raised the awareness in corporate world (though the quality of such events varies significantly).  On top of that, recent gatherings such as Cyptist and Mina Developer Meetup also attracted interest from the developer community. The momentum continues with weekly CryptoMondays events, and several people aiming to organize an ETH Istanbul in the near future.  Boosting the potential  Kaan, a pseudonymous employees of Ethereum Foundation, had a similar experience. He became interested in the area only after he took a blockchain class while an undergrad at Bogazici University. Most of his friends chose AI/ML [artificial intelligence/machine learning] back then. Had there been a blockchain club around or events organized at the time, many more of his friends would have opted for blockchain projects.  Let's not forget that the Turkish developer ecosystem here is not confined to Turks. Recent unfortunate events in Ukraine resulted in a flood of developers from Ukraine and Russia coming into Istanbul and coastal regions of Turkey. A friend of mine helped three businesses with close to 200 software engineers to relocate here. This fresh influx of talent will have a positive impact on the growth of the developer community in the region.  See also: Lessons From the Turkish Government's Hasty Attempt to Regulate Crypto | Opinion  In short: Turkey has a young population with strong potential but with limited access to the global crypto community. A handful of them get scholarships and attend global events (and win prizes).

42411725,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfX7K,1663859282,How Does Ethereum Staking Work?,"Put simply, Ethereum staking is the process of locking up an amount of ETH – the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain – for a specified period of time in order to contribute to the security of the blockchain and earn network rewards.  People who do this are known as “validators” or “stakers,” and are tasked with processing transactions, storing information and adding blocks to the Ethereum blockchain. As a reward for their active involvement in the network, validators can receive rewards and interest on their staked coins, denominated in ether.  What is proof-of-stake?  As part of plans to enable a faster and environmentally friendly transaction validation process, Ethereum protocol developers executed a switch from a consensus model known as proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) broadly known as ""the Merge"".  Proof-of-stake is a consensus mechanism that requires users to stake an amount of cryptocurrency to become validators. Validators tie up some of their ether, giving them a personal stake in keeping the network running securely, to participate in the process. They receive rewards in ether when they attest to a new block, which means they agree it is accurate, or they ""win"" a block, meaning they are randomly selected to create the next block.  Oftentimes, a validator in a PoS system will increase the chances of earning rewards on the network by staking more coins. Depending on the PoS system, users may also be able to delegate their stake to another user who can perform the responsibilities of being a validator on their behalf.  Why did Ethereum switch to PoS?  One of the main reasons for the consensus switch is to dramatically reduce the energy requirements for validating transactions and issuing new ETH. According to Vitalik Buterin, the change lowered the world’s energy consumption by 0.2%, and reduced Ethereum’s energy use by 99.988%.  One reason for that is the minimum hardware requirements to run a PoS validator node are significantly cheaper and easier to access for the average user than the advanced computer hardware needed to be a crypto miner. Ethereum staking, unlike mining, can be done on everyday computers or laptops, and so it removes the need for electricity-guzzling mining equipment. Because it's more accessible, it also means there's a strong possibility the new system will attract more node operators. That, in turn, will help boost the new network's decentralization.  PoS on Ethereum is also intended to lay the groundwork for “sharding” – a partitioning technique that allows multiple parallel chains to share data and transaction load efficiently. These shard chains, when combined with a secondary scaling product known as ""rollups,"" could allow Ethereum to process upward of 100,000 transactions per second. That's a huge leap compared with the 10-15 transactions per second it processed under proof-of-work.  Rollups involve batching dozens of transactions together off the main chain, creating a cryptographic proof for them (evidence of their validity) and then submitting that to the main chain.  Read more: What Is Sharding?  How does Ethereum staking work?  Unlike the PoW-based blockchain, the PoS-powered blockchain bundles 32 blocks of transactions during each round of validation, lasting 6.4 minutes on average. These bundles of blocks are what’s known as “epochs.” An epoch is considered finalized – that is, the transactions contained are irreversible – when the blockchain adds two more epochs after it.  During the validating process (also known as the “attesting process""), stakers are randomly grouped into “committees” of 128 and assigned to a particular shard block.  Each committee has a set time for proposing a new block and validating the transactions inside of it, called a “slot.” There are 32 slots in each epoch, meaning 32 sets of committees are required to complete the validation process in each epoch.  Once a committee is assigned to a block, one random member of the group is granted the exclusive right to propose a new block of transactions while the remaining 127 members vote on the proposal and attest to the transactions.  Once a majority of the committee has attested the new block, it’s added to the blockchain and a “cross-link” is created to confirm its insertion. Only then does the Ethereum staker who was chosen to propose the new block receive their reward.  Cross-linking is the process of reconciling individual shard states with the main chain.  Note that block proposers and attesters have varying reward models. The block proposer receives a fraction of the base reward, known as ""B,"" while the attester receives the remaining fraction of B, which is adjusted based on how long it takes for the block proposer to submit the attestation. The attester has to submit it as fast as possible to earn the entirety of the remaining B reward. For each slot that passes without the attester including the attestation to the block, the reward reduces.  A base reward is the fundamental primary determiner of the issuance rate of Ethereum post-merge. The more validators are connected to Ethereum, the lower the base reward per validator. That is because the base reward is inversely proportional to the square root of the total balance of all Ethereum validators.  How to get involved  Those interested in staking on the Ethereum network will need to have at least 32 ETH they are willing to lock up and will have to set up a staking node by running an Ethereum client. Ethereum clients are just software that enables nodes to interact with the Ethereum network.  Compatible software clients for staking nodes include:  Prysm: It is a Go language variant of the Ethereum software.  Teku: This is an enterprise-focused software client written in Java.  Lighthouse: This software client uses Rust programming language.  Lodestar: This software client was created by Chaincode Labs and uses JavaScript/ Typescript.  As a minimum requirement, you’ll need to use a computer with enough memory space to download the Ethereum blockchain.  Validators are also expected to keep their nodes connected to the blockchain 24/7. Therefore, a quality internet connection is a core criterion. After you install your validator software on your computer, the next step is to lock away a minimum of 32 ETH to the appropriate Ethereum staking contract address.  There's a lot of very specific requirements that you should review through this checklist before you begin. Check through the list and then visit the launchpad to get started.     How profitable is Ethereum staking?  The reward distributed to stakers depends on the total number of ETH staked and the number of validators on the network. When the pool of staked ETH dips, the annual interest rate increases.  For example, when there were only around 500,000 ETH staked, the annual percentage rate of interest (APR) was a little over 20%. By August, 2021, there were more than 6,800,000 ETH locked on the blockchain, meaning the APR had dropped to about 6.0%.  As soon as the pool of stakers is large enough to promote a decentralized ecosystem, the interest rate drops.  What is an Ethereum staking pool?  Understanding that not all interested stakers can afford 32 ETH to participate in the network – which at present costs over $40,000 – some platforms have begun to provide staking products that allow investors to combine their financial resources to meet the minimum requirements for becoming a validator. That is also an ideal option for individuals who don’t want to undertake the technical requirements that come with staking. In essence, users need only to deposit and lock their capital on a third-party platform and start earning returns. It’s staking without the hassle.

Market Move: The XRP token has rallied sharply this month on the anticipation of a resolution of an SEC lawsuit against Ripple, XRP's issuer.  Chart of the Day: The U.S. Treasury yield curve is now at its most inverted point in four decades.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover, our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC) was up 3.3% Thursday at around $19,100 – roughly back to where it was early Wednesday before a wild 24 hours of price swings that spanned the Federal Reserve’s latest announcement that it will continue its campaign of aggressive interest rate hikes.  The Fed’s rate moves have been pushing up the dollar’s value in foreign-exchange markets, and now cracks are starting to appear: Japan announced its first currency intervention in more than two decades to shore up the yen. Meanwhile, Switzerland, Norway and the U.K. all raised borrowing costs in the wake of the Fed’s decision.  Tighter monetary policy, in general, is seen as weighing on prices of risky assets like bitcoin. But it’s possible that the dire scenario is already priced into the market.  ""Even if central banks tighten monetary policy further, the situation will not worsen more, for the current performance of crypto assets is terrible enough,” Griffin Ardern, volatility trader from crypto asset management-firm Blofin, told CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole.  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, was gaining along with bitcoin, up 4.5% on the day to about $1,300. The broad CoinDesk Market Index was higher, led by Algorand’s ALGO with a 12% gain over the past 24 hours.  In the news, community members of the crypto-powered wireless project Helium voted to ditch their own blockchain and instead move operations onto the Solana blockchain under a plan to save resources.  The crypto exchange FTX, which is led by billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried, is reportedly in discussions to raise up to $1 billion in capital at a $32 billion valuation.

Market Moves  As XRP Rallies, Some Traders Buy Year-End Bullish Bets in the Options Market  By Omkar Godbole  Payments-focused cryptocurrency XRP has rallied sharply this month, outshining larger cryptocurrencies. Some traders are snapping up bullish bets in the options market in hopes of continued gains into the year end.  The cryptocurrency, ranked fifth by market value, traded at 42.6 cents at press time, a 28% gain for the month, according to CoinDesk data. Market leaders bitcoin and ether were down 4.5% and 17%, respectively.  ""We have seen interest in buying XRP year-end upside call options in anticipation of a resolution in the ongoing lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,"" Dick Lo, founder and CEO of Hong Kong-based quant trading firm and liquidity provider TDX Strategies, said.  A call is a derivative contract giving the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset – in this case, XRP – at a predetermined price on or before specific expiry date. A call, therefore, is preferred by bullish speculation, while a put option represents a bearish bet.  Read the full story here.  Chart of the Day  U.S. Yield Curve is Collapsing  By Omkar Godbole  The U.S. Treasury yield curve is now at its most inverted point in four decades, with the spread between yields on the 10 and two-year Treasury notes sliding to -0.52%.  ""The yield curve screams economic slowdown but also validates Powell's hawkish credentials,"" Ilan Solot, a partner at Tagus Capital, wrote in the daily market update, referring to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.  The relentless curve inversion could only add to the dollar's ongoing bullish momentum and make matters difficult for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.  The 90-day correlation coefficient between the dollar index and the yield curve was -0.8 at press time, indicating a strong inverse relationship between the two.

The funding will be used for hiring, product development and security, which includes bug bounties and additional audits, Hyperlane co-founder Jon Kol told CoinDesk in an email.  Other participants in the round include crypto financial services firm Galaxy Digital, CoinFund, Circle, Figment, Blockdaemon, Kraken Ventures, and NFX.  “The current state of crypto is fragmented, as there has been a proliferation of blockchains and applications, but users on a given blockchain can’t access applications on another,” Kol said. “It’s confusing and complex, and results in a user experience that many, even crypto veterans like our team, find cumbersome and unruly,"" he added.  Security vulnerabilities in cross-chain bridges led to an estimated $2 billion in cryptocurrency losses this year, according to a Chainalysis report last month.  Hyperlane has already completed several security audits and further security efforts will be a major use of the new funding, Kol noted.  The Hyperlane platform provides developers with a messaging application programming interface (API) and software development kit (SDK) to easily build apps that can be accessed from any blockchain. Hyperlane continues to update the platform with the recently launched Interchain Accounts and the upcoming Sovereign Consensus features, which expand the ways developers can configure the cross-chain communication.  Hyperlane was co-founded by Asa Oines and Nam Chu Hoai, who were among the first engineers at decentralized finance platform Celo, and Kol, who previously co-led Galaxy’s venture investment business. The firm is headquartered in Greenwich, Connecticut.

Other backers in the round were Electric Capital, Polygon Ventures, Samsung Next, P2P Capital, North Island Ventures, Third Prime Ventures, Lattice Capital, and Stratos DeFi.  Immunefi focuses on bug bounty and security services for Web3 projects. Since its inception in December 2020, the firm has saved over $25 billion in users’ funds, according to a statement on Thursday. Immunefi said it has paid out $60 million in total bounties, and supports over 300 projects including Chainlink, Wormhole, and MakerDAO.  The next big thing  Bug bounties are increasingly becoming an attractive revenue stream for security researchers and an efficient way for tech firms to identify weaknesses in their products. In 2020, Google announced it had paid over $21 million in bug bounties under its vulnerability reward program since 2010, spending $6.5 million in 2019 alone. In 2020, hackers from dozens of countries earned up to $40 million just by identifying system vulnerabilities for various organizations.  Bug bounty rewards have slowly been increasing across crypto as well. In 2019, crypto exchange Coinbase Global (COIN) forked out $30,000 bounty for identifying a critical bug in its systems.  The popularity of bug bounties is also due to the fact that decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, such as Balancer Labs, are increasingly vulnerable to hacks and theft. DeFi refers to financial activities carried out directly on the blockchain without any third party involvement.  According to a report by crypto sleuth CipherTrace, in the second half of 2020 half of all targeted entities for crypto-related hacks were DeFi platforms, making up 14% of total hacked volume (amounting to $47.7 million).  To this effect, in 2021 DeFi insurance brokerage ArmorFi paid a bounty of $1.5 million to a white-hat hacker who found a ""critical bug"" that could have seen all the firm’s underwriting funds drained.  “Open code and directly monetizable exploits have made web3 the most adversarial software development space in the world,"" Mitchell Amador, CEO of Immunefi, said in the statement.  “By shifting incentives towards white hats, Immunefi has already saved billions of dollars of users’ funds,"" Amador said.

42411734,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfXXm,1663851000,3 Ways Traditional Investors Can Gain Crypto Exposure,"A growing number of people are interested in crypto investment, which means financial advisors need to understand the various ways to invest into cryptocurrency and crypto related strategies.  While the asset class is still new, especially when compared to the rest of traditional finance, there are a few different ways to invest into crypto and crypto companies.  Some of these investment strategies involve direct investment in cryptocurrency and require advisors and clients to undertake a series of new steps.  Other strategies are available at traditional financial custodians and are more similar to ordinary investments.  1. Cryptocurrencies and tokens  Clients may express a desire to own cryptocurrency directly.  Building a portfolio of cryptocurrencies and tokens is relatively straightforward but must be done through a cryptocurrency platform or exchange. Companies such as Coinbase, Kraken and KuCoin are crypto exchange platforms that anyone is able to use to purchase and trade crypto assets.  Much like creating a self-directed investment portfolio on a traditional custodian, any investor can open their own account on a crypto platform and begin investing in whatever crypto asset they wish. From there, investors may choose to move their currency off the crypto exchange into self-custody with a hardware wallet. However, they are still owners of the cryptocurrency or token if they hold it on the exchange and they may decide to do so.  After creating an account on an exchange and purchasing any number of cryptocurrencies available there, advisors will need to set up a process that allows them to routinely view the accounts their clients have on these crypto platforms. This will allow them to help the client best navigate financial decisions.  Some clients may prefer this method of direct investment into cryptocurrencies but want their advisor to do it for them. The advisor may hire an SMA manager to accomplish this. SMA crypto strategies are still a growing part of the market although some firms have built these strategies and are offering it to other RIAs/Advisors.  Read more: Swan Bitcoin Moves Into TradFi With Platform for Financial Advisers  2. Hedge funds  Cryptocurrency hedge funds are growing in popularity and there are quite a few of them available.  These hedge funds allow affluent investors to allocate to crypto in an outsourced method. These clients allow the hedge fund to be the asset manager rather than buying cryptocurrencies directly and managing a crypto portfolio themselves.  Crypto hedge funds may invest in a specific part of the crypto industry, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), stablecoins, crypto mining and crypto trading firms.  However, hedge funds are for accredited investors and carry a high amount of risk for investors. Hedge funds also typically have less liquidity than other strategies and usually have higher fees, which both are things advisors must ensure their clients understand before making an allocation.  Read more: Two Sigma Ventures Raises $400M for Two Funds, Plans Crypto Investments  3. Publicly traded vehicles  Clients who wish to invest in the crypto asset class but do not wish to buy cryptocurrencies directly or use a new custodian or fund can consider publicly traded vehicles.  There are a few different publicly traded vehicles that advisors may consider in order to accomplish this goal.  Bitcoin futures ETFs: There are a few different bitcoin (BTC) futures exchange-traded funds available on the market. These allow investors to gain exposure to the price movement of bitcoin, without owning bitcoin directly. An advisor may decide that this is appropriate because the client wants price exposure but does not want to open an account on a crypto exchange. However, there are certain things that the advisor must be aware of – and disclose to their client – when using a futures-based product, including expense ratios, contango and backwardation, among others.  Bitcoin trusts: The most popular crypto trust is the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has over $12B assets under management and is a convenient way for advisors and investors to gain access to bitcoin through a traditional custodian. Shareholders of GBTC own equity in a trust and that trust owns bitcoin, but shareholders of GBTC do not own bitcoin directly. There are fees to own the various products offered by Grayscale and advisors must understand what these fees are. It’s important to note that GBTC currently trades at a -33% discount to net asset value. Grayscale has filed with the SEC to convert GBTC to an ETF, yet the conversion has been denied multiple times. There is currently no spot Bitcoin ETF available in the U.S. public markets. [Grayscale, like CoinDesk, is owned by Digital Currency Group.]  Read more: A Bitcoin ETF Is Long Past Due, Crypto Lobbyists Say in New Report  Crypto and blockchain companies: There are quite a few publicly traded companies that specialize in cryptocurrency or blockchain related services. A) Square, PayPal and Coinbase are all publicly traded companies that are integrated with the crypto industry. B) Several crypto mining companies are also available for trading on traditional exchanges. Investors can buy shares of publicly traded crypto mining companies such as Riot or Marathon Digital. C) Technology companies such as MicroStrategy also fall into the broad crypto category. MicroStrategy is a software company that also owns a tremendous amount of bitcoin. Because of its bitcoin ownership, its stock price is closely correlated with the price movement of BTC.  Crypto and blockchain company funds: Investors may wish to buy a diversified basket of these crypto-related companies instead of owning individual equities. There are quite a few exchange traded funds available that focus on crypto-related companies. The largest ETF (by AUM) is the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (symbol: BLOX), which has over $600,000,000 in assets. These ETFs are considered “thematic” strategies. They are designed to invest into a specific theme – in this case blockchain and cryptocurrency. Advisors may use these funds as a part of their strategy for clients.  Weigh the pros and cons  While the crypto asset class is still developing, there are quite a few strategies currently available to investors.  Advisors must understand the pros and cons of each method, the potential benefits and risks associated with the different strategies, and must be able to communicate them to their clients.  Advisors must understand how cryptocurrency exposure could help their clients and then help their client decide on the best method to invest in the asset class.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Jackson Wood,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/3-ways-traditional-investors-can-gain-crypto-exposure,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9ad98261aec6682f0b4166ed4a72f74dcdec1a3d-5119x3417.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421444,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoMU1,1663850814,The Merge Doesn’t Solve Ethereum’s 'Atomic Composability',"The Merge of Ethereum’s network is a significant accomplishment in the history of open-source software and Web3. For the most part, this transition from the more energy-intensive proof-of-work consensus mechanism to the less energy-intensive proof-of-stake has been celebrated for its increased sustainability.  But while the story of the day is about energy conservation, the Merge skirts a looming problem for Ethereum. Network updates after the Merge are intended to finally begin improving Ethereum’s scalability – but these proposals threaten the viability and sustainability of a healthy Web3 ecosystem.  Jeremy Epstein is the chief marketing officer of Radix, a layer 1 smart contract platform. You can follow him at @jer979 on Twitter.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  “Atomic composability,” which made decentralized finance (DeFi) on Ethereum possible to begin with, becomes compromised. And when you break atomic composability, you hinder the very thing that makes an ecosystem truly sustainable long-term.  See also: Evaluating Ethereum: 1 Week After the Merge  What is atomic composability and why does it matter?  Atomic composability is a technical term for saying that any application on a network can frictionlessly interact with any other application. Ethereum is going to consciously break composability by segregating parts of its network from each other in the implementation of sharding or layer 2 systems.  To make this concept more concrete, let’s consider the health of a rainforest or a desert.  Without pollinators, one-third of all our edible fruits and vegetables could not grow, according to experts.  You’ve most likely heard about the declining bee population, but the story repeats itself over and over and over again all over the world. The destruction of agave plants for tequila production jeopardizes the survival of the bats that pollinate the most important cactus in the desert, putting the entire ecosystem at risk. Whaling ultimately leads to the destruction of fish stocks.  The fact is that biodiversity is essential for the survival and growth of natural ecosystems, and when this cycle is threatened the consequences are far-reaching and devastating.  As far back as 2009, the Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity organization put out a report highlighting just how much economic value for humans is directly connected to ecosystem biodiversity, including up to 50% of the pharmaceutical industry and 100% of the agricultural industry, among many others.  So if biodiversity is so important and valuable for physical ecosystems, why wouldn’t application diversity be essential for the survival and growth of digital ecosystems?  The answer: It is.  The more application diversity within an ecosystem, the more its apps are able to “cross-pollinate” with each other, leading to a more robust, resilient ecosystem that can fuel all kinds of growth. This can also lead to new species of applications and new wealth creation for the humans who rely on them.  Protecting the 4 superpowers is the key to Web3 eco-diversity  Web3 has four superpowers: tokenization, decentralized applications, two-sided markets without intermediaries and composability.  Taking away one of these superpowers by walling off certain applications from each other through specific types of blockchain sharding or layer 2 implementations (as nearly every smart contract platform does) is like separating the bat from the plant it pollinates.  We’re witnessing the impact on our world as we destroy natural diversity, separating flora and fauna from the ecosystems in which they have thrived and are interdependent.  See also: JPMorgan Sees Concerns for Ethereum Blockchain After the Merge  Now, at the dawn of Web3, as we look to birth the most dynamic, flourishing digital ecosystem for the future of global finance, we can’t afford to make that same mistake.  Decentralized networks that preserve all four superpowers, including atomic composability, will give emergent digital ecosystems the most room to flourish.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Jeremy Epstein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/09/22/the-merge-doesnt-solve-ethereums-atomic-composability,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/706167ba5d7744be5be086011908a0c9d8d1f044-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It has allowed us to communicate and connect with the world in a way that has never been possible in human history. Furthermore, it offers us the ability to form bonds with the world and find like-minded individuals who share the same ideas and beliefs. However, social media is not without its limitations. One of the largest of which is to do with how information is presented and passed along. Social media platforms are practically all 2-dimensional, meaning that all data is displayed in a 2-dimensional format (i.e., on a screen). This means that people can only connect via text, images, sounds, and videos. While this is certainly still good, it cannot be denied that it leaves us longing for more. We live in a 3-dimensional reality, which means we experience the world in a much richer way than current-day social media can display.

42393945,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brdDdb,1663848000,Indonesia Has Global Plans for Local Crypto Tokens,"If the Indonesian government is right, locally issued crypto tokens could one day join palm oil or coal among the southeast Asian country's major export commodities.  While Jakarta takes an active interest in regulating the crypto industry, President Joko Widodo’s administration apparently sees merit in helping the local token economy grow – hoping to even benefit from taxing local digital assets that make it onto global trading platforms.  “Indonesia is looking forward to having a lot of commodities to be exported. And we can grab this opportunity to make crypto as one of the potential products for exports,” Jerry Sambuaga, Indonesia’s vice minister of trade, told CoinDesk in an interview.  For more local coverage of Indonesia, visit the new CoinDesk Indonesia website.  In Indonesia, the use of crypto as a currency for payments is forbidden under both local regulations and Islamic law – which applies to roughly 87% of the country’s 273 million people. Crypto assets, however, are classified as commodities in the country, lumped into the same category as things like grains or gold.  And thanks to a growing national love of speculative trading online, crypto is wildly popular in Indonesia, making it one of the most dynamic markets in the world.  According to Indonesia’s trade ministry, the country has more than 14 million crypto users, compared with nine million stock traders. The number of crypto traders as of March surged 300% from 2020, driven in part by a large unbanked population. Although the crypto bear market has slashed volumes traded globally, and the Southeast Asian nation was no exception, Indonesians have already traded 212 trillion rupiah ($14.3 billion) worth of crypto in the first half of 2022, trade ministry data reviewed by CoinDesk shows.  Read more: Indonesia Wants Citizens to Steer Local Crypto Exchanges: Report  Crypto as exports  In Indonesia, cryptocurrencies are classified as commodities and regulated by the country’s Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency (Bappebti) under the Ministry of Trade. Bappebti works with the Blockchain Association of Indonesia (ABI), a trade group, to set up and maintain licensing rules for crypto assets and service providers.  On Aug. 1, Bappebti published an updated list of 383 cryptocurrencies– many of them globally traded digital assets like bitcoin and ethereum– that Indonesians are allowed to trade.  According to Sambuaga, Indonesia has big plans for locally issued tokens, as well. If Indonesia could foster and develop approved local tokens into “valuable products,” those tokens can be treated –and consequently taxed– as Indonesian commodities traded on global markets, he said.  Sambuga indicated local token issuers could also boost the country’s economy. He said these issuers have recently hosted events and run promotions in Indonesia and overseas, consequently bringing in “consumers,” “potential investors” and “stakeholders that would like to collaborate with local coin developers.”  Read more: Indonesia to Establish 'Crypto Stock' Exchange by 2022-End  That’s not to say, however, that it’s easy to get a local token on the coveted Bappebti white list for approved assets.  Agustino Wibisono, founder of the Indonesian crypto startup Sangkara, has been trying to get his token greenlighted by local regulators since last November. Without the approval, the token can’t be listed for trading on regulated crypto exchanges in the country.  “We hope we will get our license quite fast,” Wibisono said, optimistic that a recent venture capital injection in his startup will tip the scales in his favor.  Wibisono is one of many local entrepreneurs who are trying to get their tokens approved in order to list them on local exchanges.  Only 10 out of the 383 licensed tokens in Indonesia are local, Sambuaga said in August. Hopefuls like Wibisono have to go through a rigorous assessment conducted by the ABI before their tokens can be approved for trading.  Wibisono says he has been updating regulators about his startup’s operations on a regular basis since last December in the hopes of securing approval for his token. Earlier this month, CNBC Indonesia reported that a local token ASIX wasn’t approved for the white list, and will have to apply again.  The token assessment  To be able to trade in Indonesia, a digital token must be based on distributed ledger technology. It must also be classified as an “asset” or “backed asset,” because the use of crypto as a means of payment is forbidden under local regulations, as well as under Islamic law.  All local token issuers seeking a spot on the white list must also go through an assessment called the “analytical hierarchy process” (AHP), which is conducted by the ABI and Bappebti.  The ABI looks at the market capitalization of the asset, the exchanges it is listed on as well as the economic benefits and risks associated with the token and gives the asset a score before Bappebti reviews it.  “As long as it meets the criteria, then they could be included in the white list. So it's a very open and very transparent method of creating a white list,” said Jay Jayawijayaningtiyas, the country manager of crypto exchange Luno, which is a member of the ABI. Luno's parent company, Digital Currency Group, owns CoinDesk.  But this is where things get rough for local token issuers, according to Asih Karnengsih, chairwoman of the ABI. Karnengsih says new local tokens that haven’t been listed on exchanges or that are traded on only a few platforms aren’t likely to score high on the AHP test conducted by the association and crypto exchanges.  “The regulation is quite clear, but it's not ideal yet. So what the association is trying to do is to help [regulators] to explore how we can make the process better, specifically to make sure the local projects can grow here in Indonesia,” Karnengsih said.  Indodax, which is one of the country’s largest crypto exchanges with more than 5.5 million users, has an easier time listing popular and global cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum than local tokens, according to co-founder and CEO Oscar Darmawan.  “But we believe that the situation will change because the government is saying that they will try to list as many local tokens as possible … so the crypto exchanges can trade localized tokens as well,” Darmawan said.  Through the AHP assessment, Indonesian regulators are allowing the industry to self-regulate to a certain degree. But self-regulation in the crypto world doesn’t have the best track record. Regulators in Japan have fallen out with an industry body– which perhaps led the world’s most prominent crypto self-regulation experiment– over management issues and delays in implementing anti-money-laundering regulations.  Karnengsih says Indonesia’s regulators are leaning on the ABI for assistance due to a lack of human resources, particularly with the technical knowledge of the crypto industry.  “They try to involve us a lot because, yeah, they don't really have people who can actually really see the industry. So that's why we do a lot of work,” Karnengsih said.  Local regulators also deploy other tactics to make the industry safer and more transparent for users. Recently, the regulator set up a help line called “Lini Bappebti” to respond to complaints and help with general requests for information on crypto assets. Bappebti has also increased monitoring and supervision of crypto traders and exchanges.  ‘Open’  The recent market downturn has slashed the value of the average transaction on Indodax by half, but new users on the exchange are still growing at a steady rate, according to Darmawan.  “I think the appetite for the investors in Indonesia is still extremely positive. This is reflected in the number of people entering the crypto space. Obviously, it's not as fast as 2021. But it's still faster compared to the other industries,” Luno’s Jayawijayaningtiyas said, referring to the discrepancy between the number of stock traders in the country compared with crypto investors.  Sambuaga, the vice minister of trade, says the goal of developing local tokens is to eventually tax them, Indonesia taxes crypto investments at a far lower rate than some other Asian markets do. In Japan, crypto retail investors are taxed up to 55% for capital gains on crypto profits. By contrast, Indonesia implemented a 0.1% capital gains and value-added tax on crypto income and transactions earlier this year.  Read more: South Korea Plans to Tax Crypto Airdrop Recipients: Report  Darmawan says the tax is an effort to formalize crypto as a form of investment, as opposed to a restrictive measure.  “Indonesia is open for any kind of investment, collaboration, and we are seeing crypto commodities as one of the potential products for our potential exports,” Sambuaga said. “We are promoting our local tokens and we are happy, and let's say we are certain that in the future, we will be one of the key players in crypto.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | COMMODITY | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,"Sandali Handagama, Ni Dan",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/22/indonesia-has-global-plans-for-local-crypto-tokens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a3f5b4f84f86bb31243b46475a3c07aa340bd9d3-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The chain, a so-called ""rollup"" for the Ethereum blockchain, is expected to maintain its strength, because it increased its lead in both speed and costs with its recent Nitro upgrade. It has also launched a Web3 and gaming chain called Nova, the report said.  Rollups such as Arbitrum and rival layer 2 blockchain Optimism scale the Ethereum network by processing transactions and executing smart contracts – computer programs that run on some blockchains – on their own chains.  Bernstein said it expects a host of trading, gaming and non-fungible-token (NFT) projects to be released on the blockchain. NFTs are digital assets on a blockchain that represent ownership of virtual or physical items and that can be sold or traded.  The broker also noted speculation of a potential Arbitrum token launch in the near term, which could be used to reward early users.  Ethereum’s large user and developer base “will continue to act as a feeder to rollups,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agrawal wrote, adding that they “expect a new growth cycle to emerge in crypto as rollups drive mainstream application building on Ethereum.”  Layer 2 blockchains are “providing the first proof of concept that rollups work while relying on the security and settlement network of Ethereum,” the note said. “This retains the relevance of Ethereum and makes it competitive versus peers.""  Arbitrum recently paid about 400 ether, worth about $530,000 at the time, to a hacker who flagged a vulnerability in the upgrade. Developers behind the scaling tool had missed a change that would have allowed attackers to steal all funds sent to the network.

The business&apos;s 65% ownership will be held by creditors, as described in a term sheet the company released. 15% of the company&apos;s outstanding shares will be allotted to the team, and they will accrue over time through an employee share option program (ESOP). Investors in the Series B round will continue to hold shares of the restructured business. CoinFLEX Deal With BCH Alliance According to CoinFlex, the plan also included a deal with the BCH alliance under which the collaboration would take over the management of the SmartBCH Bridge.

The BOE's second straight 50 bps move came a day after the Federal Reserve delivered its third consecutive 75 bps rate hike and signaled a higher terminal rate or peak rate of 4.6%.  The BOE said the inflation peak is likely to be lower than projected in August, at just under 11% and maintained that its policy isn't on a preset path.  The Swiss National Bank also lifted its borrowing cost by 75 basis points early during the day, exiting the negative interest rate policy. Meanwhile, Japan intervened in the foreign-exchange markets to stall the yen's slide.  The coordinated tightening, which began early this year, represents reverse currency wars – a race among central bankers to raise rates and support their fiat currencies to keep inflation in check.  The reverse currency wars indicate the path of least resistance for risky assets, including cryptocurrencies, is on the downside. Some analysts, however, believe the crypto market has already taken a beating and there is little downside left.

ShareRing said the decision to slash conversion steps from three to two would drastically boost efficiency, lower the cost of conversion, and save time. $SHR is native to ShareLedger, a Leased Proof-of-Stake blockchain that&apos;s scalable and energy efficient. Compliant with the ShareRing standard, the token is primarily used to pay transaction fees. However, because the token is cross-chain and can be held in various blockchains, including the BNB Chain, and Ethereum, all $SHR transactions can be tracked on the ShareLedger blockchain. There is a trail that prevents fraud by ensuring a simple and reliable tracking mechanism on the ShareLedger blockchain. Before this announcement, $SHR token holders were required to shift their BEP-2 token first to the BEP-20 version in the BNB Chain through the non-custodial Binance Wallet. In the second step, they had to move the newly converted BEP-20 $SHR to Ethereum as an ERC-20 token through the Multichain Bridge. Afterward, they had to move them to ShareLedger (ShareRing App) as an SPL3 token. This three-step procedure was not only tedious but consumed many resources.

Proof Collective, the company behind Moonbirds, raised $50 million on August 30 in a round that was co-founded and backed by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z).

42422290,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0jbVh,1663844509,JPMorgan Sees Concerns for Ethereum Blockchain After the Merge,"JPMorgan spelled some concerns about the Ethereum blockchain following the network's transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, a process that was called the Merge.  The change earlier this month spurred a hard fork, splitting the blockchain in two and giving rise to an offshoot chain called Ethereum PoW. Some exchanges and platforms have shown support for the forked version, which still uses proof-of-work (PoW) verification, and at least 19 former ether mining pools are active on it, JPMorgan said in a research note on Wednesday. The forked chain could divide the Ethereum community, the firm said.  Read more: Ethereum Already Showing Signs of Increased Centralization  A second concern is that the blockchain has become less decentralized, the bank said, “as [just a] few entities command the majority share of staked ETH.”  JPMorgan noted that the price of ether (ETH) has declined sharply. This drop was probably caused by a combination of “buy-the-rumor/sell-the-news flows specific to Ethereum’s Merge event,” together with widespread weakness in risky assets as a result of more hawkish central banks, the report said.  The Merge is the first of five upgrades planned for the blockchain.  Meanwhile, a move to ""backwardation"" in the futures market is a “manifestation of the shift towards more bearish sentiment in crypto markets in recent weeks,” the note said. Backwardation occurs when the spot price of an asset is higher than its futures price.  In terms of mining, Ethereum Classic's ETC token has been the main beneficiary of the Merge. The network's hashrate has doubled, with the tokens of other graphics processing-unit-compatible PoW blockchains such as Ravencoin and Ergo also witnessing big increases, the note added.

The exchange hired at least four Wall Street traders to form a group called Coinbase Risk Solutions to use the firm's own cash to trade crypto, the report said.  Proprietary trading is when a firm engages in trading of stocks, bonds, currencies or commodities using its own money as opposed to that of its clients. Such activity is fraught with risk and the potential of conflicts of interest for the financial firm should its trades have an effect on the prices of those assets, which could in turn hurt its clients.  Coinbase executives said in December that it did not engage in proprietary trading when they appeared in Congress.  However, with the price of digital assets encountering a downward trajectory throughout 2022, dragging Coinbase stock down in the process, Coinbase may have turned to trading on its platform as a means of creating new avenues for profit.  In response, Coinbase said the WSJ report had confused ""client-driven activities"" with proprietary trading.  ""Coinbase does, from time to time, purchase cryptocurrency as principal, including for our corporate treasury and operational purposes,"" the exchange said.  ""We do not view this as proprietary trading because its purpose is not for Coinbase to benefit from short-term increases in value of the cryptocurrency being traded.""  CRS' role is to expand institutional participation in crypto by offering services to investors who are still getting to grip with digital assets, Coinbase added.

42422340,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0jc3h,1663841118,"As XRP Rallies, Some Traders Buy Year-End Bullish Bets in the Options Market","Payments-focused cryptocurrency XRP has rallied sharply this month, outshining larger cryptocurrencies. Some traders are snapping up bullish bets in the options market in hopes of continued gains into the end of the year.  The cryptocurrency, ranked fifth by market value, traded at about 43 cents at press time, a 28% gain for the month, according to CoinDesk data. Market leaders bitcoin and ether were down 4.5% and 17%, respectively.  ""We have seen interest in buying XRP year-end upside call options in anticipation of a resolution in the ongoing lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,"" Dick Lo, the founder and CEO of Hong Kong-based quant trading firm and liquidity provider TDX Strategies, said.  A call is a derivative contract giving the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset – in this case, XRP – at a predetermined price on or before specific expiry date. A call, therefore, is preferred by bullish speculation, while a put option represents a bearish bet.  In December 2020, the Securities and Commission (SEC) charged San Francisco-based payment protocol developer Ripple Labs, which has close ties with XRP, with violating securities laws by raising $1.3 billion through XRP sales to investors. As a result, the token crashed even as bitcoin and the broader market went berserk.  Last week the SEC and Ripple Labs filed for a so-called summary judgment – a legal process where a court makes a decision based on the facts that have been provided without ordering a trial – raising expectations of a final ruling before the year-end. That would eliminate a significant source of uncertainty in the XRP market.  The XRP rally indicates that news- or event-driven trading is the flavor of the season. Another sign: ATOM rallied sharply early this month on expectations that network Cosmos will announce the interchain security at a Sept. 26 conference, opening doors for the token to capture value from the entire network.  For XRP, the daily chart appears to have flipped bullish with the token exiting a 10-month-long bearish trendline.  ""If the ruling is in Ripple's favor, XRP could rally quickly to [68 cents] and then potentially to [93 cents] (Fibonacci retracement levels),"" Lo told CoinDesk, adding that fund clients and high-net-worth individuals have been buying 50 cent strike XRP calls expiring on Dec. 30.  Theoretically, buyers of the 50 cent strike calls are betting that the cryptocurrency will rally beyond 50 cents before the expiry.  ""Buying a call option provides exposure to the potentially explosive upside move while capping the potential loss,"" Lo said.  A call buyer pays compensation in the form of options premium to the seller for offering protection against price rallies. The premium paid is the maximum money a call buyer stands to lose in case of a market slide. In contrast, the maximum profit can be unlimited, because, in theory, an asset can rally to infinity.  However, trading options is generally more complicated as several factors, such as time to expiry and volatility, influence prices. It is better suited for sophisticated or institutional investors with ample capital supply.",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/22/as-xrp-rallies-some-traders-buy-year-end-bullish-bets-in-the-options-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5c12d559510cd6bb059717c7509556221601e848-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Three members of the Senate Banking Committee – Sens. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Steve Daines (R-Montana) and Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) – and four members of the House Financial Services Committee – Reps. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio), Ted Budd (R-N.C.), Trey Hollingsworth (R-Indiana) and William Timmons (R-S.C.) – submitted an friend of the court (amicus) brief on Thursday, urging a Wyoming court to dismiss the Federal Reserve’s motion to dismiss a suit filed by Custodia.  A similar brief has also been filed by the state of Wyoming.  Custodia (formerly known as Avanti Bank) filed suit against the Fed in June, alleging that the U.S. central bank was unlawfully delaying its decision on whether or not to grant the crypto bank’s application for a master account, and calling for an immediate approval. At the time of the suit, Custodia had already waited 19 months to hear back about its application – seven months longer than the allotted one-year statutory deadline for such a decision.  In Custodia’s complaint, lawyers for the Wyoming-based bank argued that a master account was “vital to Custodia’s ability to operate effectively and efficiently,” and that the Fed’s continued waffling on the decision was detrimental to Custodia’s customers – and, furthermore, indicated a “black box bureaucratic process with no clear rules” that allowed it to “act in complete secrecy, whenever and however they choose.”  Sen. Lummis and her fellow lawmakers have echoed Custodia’s concerns in their brief, arguing that the Fed’s indecision is unlawful under the Monetary Control Act of 1980, which requires the Fed to issue a master account to every qualifying depository institution in the U.S. “without exception.” Failure to do so, they argue, is discriminatory.  “The Board [of Governors] and the Reserve Bank are not empowered to determine what is – and what is not – a ‘depository institution’ under the existing statutory scheme,” they write. “It is not conceivable that the Board or the Reserve Bank should have the authority to essentially determine what depository institutions are ‘real depository institutions’ and which are not.”  The lawmakers also back up Custodia’s claims that the Fed’s failure to issue them a master account has negatively affected their business, writing:  “A depository institution that does not have a master account ‘can’t really function as a financial institution’ and if the Federal Reserve has the ability to determine which depository institutions can and cannot receive a master account, the Fed would essentially be the ultimate decision-maker for what is and is not a bank in this country.”  The Federal Reserve, for its part, has argued that it needs more time to consider the broader ramifications and logistics of offering crypto-based institutions access to its payment systems.

Striga was given the authorization to operate on Sept. 20, the Estonian financial intelligence unit (FIU), an anti-money laundering enforcer, said in a statement dated Wednesday. The company, part of Bitcoin Lightning startup LastBit, is now registered under an anti-money laundering law which seeks to clamp down on a previously liberal regime for regulating crypto firms.  The head of the FIU, Matis Mäeker, told CoinDesk in May that he wanted to professionalize the sector via the new regime. Many of the hundreds of companies registered in the country had no proper business plan or nexus in the country, Mäeker said.  Striga Chief Executive Officer Bernardo Magnani said at the time that the approval process had been “challenging, to say the least … [F]or us it was hard to predict how it was going to look.”  Existing firms also had to renew their licenses under the new Estonian law, which took effect in March. The challenge of complying with the new hurdles, which include requirements to hold minimum levels of capital and to have dedicated compliance officers, has led the number of registered firms to plummet from 381 in December to 177 as of Wednesday.  “Regulation in this space is just starting,” Magnani said during a Thursday telephone interview, with the European Union just now finalizing its landmark Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA), and more potentially still to come. “We believe that being at the front of that will allow us to be very competitive.”  Read more: In Estonia, the Party’s Over for 'Hippie' Crypto Firms",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/22/estonia-grants-first-crypto-license-to-lastbits-striga,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c03f34d735ff8af9be8190429d3f1fbe6b040e4e-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Thirteen digital assets related proposals are in the pipeline.  After issuing an arrest warrant for Terra co-founder Do Kwon, South Korea has also asked Interpol, the international police organization, to issue a ""red notice"" for Kwon so that he can be arrested wherever he is found. The arrest warrants for Kwon and five others, all Korean nationals, came after the collapse of the $40 billion Terra ecosystem and the ensuing shockwaves that rattled the crypto markets and lead to a series of bankruptcies.

Accumulated across 20.49K aggregate sales, up around 48%. On September 8, 2022, the trading volume of ENS domains surpassed $2.6M, making it the highest trading volume in the last 30 days, and notably became the top of the NFT market trading volume. Over 8.93K unique owners have reportedly acquired an ENS name, a trend which has become increasingly popular thanks to leading crypto and NFT influencers adding their ENS (.eth) names via social media apps like Twitter. Notably, the price of the ENS Index token, ENSDOMAIN, which was introduced by MEXC, surged by over 300% with the rise in popularity of ENS Domains. MEXC splits 4-digit ENS Domain NFTs (or non-fungible tokens) into 26,000,000 ENSDOMAIN index tokens (1,000,000 ENSDOMAIN for each NFT). The ENSDOMAIN index offers clients the option to trade unique, blue-chip NFTs at an affordable cost. If a trader owns a considerably large percentage of the index, then they are able to exchange their index holdings for any one of the 26 ENS Domains NFTs. MEXC will reportedly expand the collection based on market demand, and MEXC&apos;s total position will not surpass 10%.

Opera, one of the original web browsers, has been building crypto products since 2018. It released a beta version of its specialist “Crypto Browser Project” in January.  In March, the Norwegian browser company added in-browser crypto wallet support for eight other blockchains, including Solana and Polygon.  Opera and other crypto-focussed browsers, like Brave, have been betting big on an explosion in Web3, which refers to the third generation of Internet services driven by blockchain. The increased Web3 integration will make it easier for users to interact with different decentralized finance (DeFi) and other on-chain ecosystems.  “The vision we share and the common goal of minimizing user onboarding friction into Web3 are the driving force behind this new collaboration,” Beniamin Mincu, CEO of Elrond, said.  Later this year, Opera will add support for Elrond’s dapps, blockchain applications that run without a central administrator, and its native token EGLD, Senior product manager of Opera Crypto Browser, Danny Yao told CoinDesk.

42421093,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXZSc1,1663833896,"EU Project to Fight Fakes Succeeds by Being Open, Founder Says","Eonpass is the latest startup to try to find business applications for Web3 technology that can grow to real-world scale.  Galvanized by official backing from the European Union, its founder believes the company can succeed where others have failed, with open-source technology meaning anyone can join forces to stop the influx of counterfeit goods.  Distributed ledgers, which in principle offer an immutable record of provenance that can’t be altered, should be a good way to verify supply chains. But Eonpass’ leadership is well aware of the problems that have previously bedeviled the sector known as enterprise blockchain.  Eonpass has an advantage. In March, it won a competition run by the European Union’s intellectual property office, EUIPO. Alongside partners including consulting firm EY and freight forwarder Jet Air Service, Eonpass had the best model for using blockchain technology to detect fraudulent goods arriving at the border, according to EUIPO, a branch of the EU’s administration responsible for trademarks and similar issues.  That has put a spring in the step of Eonpass’ founder, Thomas Rossi.  “As a startup I have to be optimistic,” Rossi told CoinDesk in an online interview. “I took a lot of time to study why previous enterprise blockchains – I don't want to say they failed, but they didn't scale.”  EUIPO’s interest is clear: Counterfeiting costs.  A 2019 study by consultants at the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) put the global price tag of fake pharmaceuticals at between $75 billion and $200 billion, with phony electronic parts costing a further $100 billion. EUIPO itself says 6.8% of the EU’s imports from the rest of the world are fake, corresponding to around $134 billion per year. Plus there’s the nonfinancial cost of having unsafe drugs or children's toys on the market.  Fighting this isn’t easy. Customs officers the world over have a stark choice of whether to trust easily forged paperwork or force individual pallets open to check. Banks stake significant volumes of trade finance on the outcome.  Opaque  Trade in conventional goods – like prescription drugs or electronics – “is a very opaque industry and there is no way to link one shipment to the originating brand owner that approves the content of the shipment and this destination,” Rossi said.  More innovative assets like non-fungible tokens, blockchain-powered assets which are supposedly used to prove an item’s ownership and authenticity, can still be faked: he cites the appearance of knock-off Hermès NFTs on OpenSea, and compares NFT platforms to a Wild West free of intellectual property rights.  Rossi – like BCG – believes blockchain can help, providing customs officers with an unfakeable attestation. While IBM’s product runs on the company’s own blockchain, based on the open-source Hyperledger, Rossi’s will be adaptable enough to work with brands who might already have opted to use Ethereum rather than an alternative blockchain such as Polygon, he said.  “The most important function of blockchains is that they create a shared clock,” Rossi said. “So you cannot cheat on the chronological order of events.”  Existing blockchain products – he cites TradeLens, an initiative of computer giant IBM and shipping company Maersk – might have worked well for a small handful of well-resourced big businesses, but not for what he calls the “long tail” of numerous, smaller subcontractors.  IBM’s initiative is “not really open source, so there is no way to spin up a node and connect to a network,” Rossi said. “Maybe inside their closed system, everything works fine … but leaving the system or letting someone else from another system come in – that part is extremely difficult.”  Contacted by CoinDesk, a spokesperson for IBM said that TradeLens is “built on open standards” and “enables supply chain participants to securely and transparently share data with one another.”  Following the publication of this article, IBM further clarified that TradeLens has more than a thousand participating organizations which include small logistics firms and trucking companies. The initiative has thus far covered 65 million containers and 4.7 billion shipping events, such as a clearing of customers or transfer between carriers, which IBM says is ""not a small number."" The platform can also accept data from ocean carriers whether or not they are members, and it can run in multiple environments beyond IBM Cloud.  Read more: IBM and Maersk Struggle to Sign Partners to Shipping Blockchain  Closed, proprietary systems have their advantages, notably allowing a tighter grip on revenues to recoup investment. Yet, grabbing even a sliver of the $10 trillion spent on global trade would be worthwhile. Rossi has a plan for that, too.  Early on, Rossi reckons he can make money by consulting for big business clients; later, by offering efficient data services for trade financers. He wants to move up from the three companies already testing to 10 by the end of next year, and 100 within a couple of years.  “I've already spoken with a couple of banks here in Italy. They're really looking forward to having some more efficient way to handle the decisions that they make about the financing of value shipments,” he said. “The monetization comes after the network is as large as possible.”  Unlikely evangelist  Support from the EUIPO is helpful, Rossi says, not least for making potential luxury brand clients sit up and take notice. And the EU agency remains an evangelist for a system it thinks could help overworked border guards.  “Given the limited resources of enforcement officers, technologies such as blockchain could prove to be game-changing tools in the fight against trade in counterfeit products,” a spokesperson for the EUIPO told CoinDesk in a written interview. “Globally stakeholders are using various systems, which when operating are often disjointed, and this isolation is used by criminal networks to their advantage.”  Results of the proof of concept for Eonpass’ model will be presented early next year, with a basic product publicly available by the end of 2023, EUIPO says. The EU agency itself is creating a database to match brands to public keys, so customs agents can check declarations signed on the blockchain are valid. It’s also working with U.S. counterparts, and presented a paper to the World Intellectual Property Organization earlier in September.  The vision is an infrastructure “where any interested party (producers, consumers, transport services, etc.) can easily check the authenticity of a product and alert right-holders when an infringing product is detected,” said a leaked version of the paper, whose authenticity EUIPO has since confirmed.  All will be watching to see if, with EU backing, business-focused blockchain ideas can actually thrive in the wild.

The HIP 70 proposal concluded voting early Thursday morning, with some 81% voting in favor of migration in early Asian hours. Participants staked the helium token (HNT) to participate in the on-chain vote. In order for a vote to migrate the network to pass, a two-thirds majority was needed.  Some 6,177 community members voted in favor of the move by staking over 12 million HNT. Just 1,270 voted against it.  Developers behind Helium proposed the migration to Solana to help scale the protocol through more efficient transactions as well as interoperability. The move will transfer all tokens, applications and governance to the network.  ""Solana has a proven track record powering some of the world’s most important decentralized initiatives and they were an obvious choice for us to partner with,"" Scott Sigel, COO of the Helium Foundation, said in a statement. ""Moving to the Solana blockchain allows us to focus our efforts on scaling the network as opposed to managing the blockchain itself.”  The migration will see HNT, MOBILE and IOT issued on the Solana network, which will continue to be the tokens in the Helium ecosystem. Once the migration is complete, a new version of the Helium Wallet App will be made available. Additionally, the Helium layer 1 blockchain history will remain public. Users will be able to access the new application by updating their current wallet app. HNT holders can also use other wallets within the Solana ecosystem, such as Phantom or Solflare.  However, although the votes show overwhelming support for the migration, not everyone has been on board with the network’s choice to move to Solana. Last week, Borderless Capital, an Algorand-focused VC that is backed by Helium, took to Twitter to suggest the network reconsider its choice to move to Solana, and instead move to Algorand.",POSITIVE,HNT,BLOCKCHAIN | SOL | HNT,"Cam Thompson, Shaurya Malwa",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/09/22/helium-ditches-own-blockchain-in-favor-of-solana-after-community-vote,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/688bd08c790f7d8ead22140ee2fe41d690516748-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Over the last 24 hours, SOL has depreciated 2.6%. In the past week, the altcoin&apos;s gains were negated by the ongoing lateral trading. Buying strength has remained low over the last week and that has further pushed Solana price to their closest support line. If buyers push the price higher, SOL could attempt to topple over the $33 price level. As sellers continue to dominate, it could be tough for SOL to experience a breakout from the $30-$32 price zone. The bulls failed to hold onto the $33 price mark and ever since that, the coin has continued to spiral downwards. Increased consolidation of SOL has reduced buyers&apos; confidence.

Crypto Prices Sink During Seesaw Day  By James Rubin  The Fed decreed and crypto markets scrambled, sending assets higher in the initial hours following the U.S. central bank's latest, hefty interest rate hike, and then spiraling.  Bitcoin was recently trading at about $18,500, a more than 2% decline over the past 24 hours, although the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization dipped well below $18,400 at one point Monday (UTC), its lowest level since early June. A year ago, BTC's price was more than double its current level.  Ether was recently changing hands at roughly $1,250, a roughly 5.5% drop from the previous day. The price of the second largest crypto by market value has been tumbling in the aftermath of last week's Merge, the landmark technological overhaul of the Ethereum network as investors prioritize its potential, longer-term benefits over immediate price impact. Investors will soon be eyeing next year's Ethereum’s “Shanghai” upgrade, which will allow users to withdraw staked ETH.  Other cryptos followed a similar price pattern, rising immediately after the rate announcement before plummeting, with EOS recently off more than 10% and YGG and ADA both down over 4%.  Other assets  Crypto prices tracked major stock indexes, which also seesawed during the day, rising early before plunging post-announcement. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500, which has a robust technology component, each dropped 1.7%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell 1.8% as markets chewed over Federal Reserve comments indicating more harsh inflationary medicine to come. The declines did not sweep up exchange giant Coinbase and other crypto-exposed companies, which rose on the day.  The Fed raised interest rates by a robust 75 basis points for a third consecutive time after the most recent price data showed inflation remaining stubbornly high and the economy slowing more gradually than the bank had hoped, including a still torrid job market. The consensus among officials involved in the latest policy decision is for the bank to raise rates a total of 1.25% at its two remaining Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings this year.  The Fed hopes to lower inflation to 2% from its current, near four-decade high over 8%. ""My main message has not changed at all,"" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said during a press conference, referencing his speech at the Fed's Economic Symposium last month in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. ""The FOMC is strongly resolved to bring inflation down to 2% and we will keep at it until the job is done.""  The rate increase highlighted a day of concerning events for the global economy. Two-year Treasury yields, which have moved in opposite direction of crypto prices, soared over 4% following the Fed announcement, their highest level in 15 years. And home sales declined for a seventh straight month. With 30-year-fixed mortgage rates already soaring to 6% for the first time in almost 15 years, the drop-off should continue.  Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin ratcheted up macroeconomic uncertainty, announcing the call-up of 300,000 troops to bolster the country's rapidly faltering invasion of the Ukraine. The unprovoked attack has affected energy prices and global supply chains.  Yet, inflation and monetary policy remained central for most crypto investors and observers of the space. Riyad Carey, a research analyst at crypto data firm Kaiko noted ""a sharper price reaction to the CPI release than to the [Ethereum upgrade] Merge.""  ""I don’t foresee crypto, especially BTC and ETH, bucking the Fed’s influence any time soon,"" he said.  Biggest Gainers  There are no gainers in CoinDesk 20 today.

By Shaurya Malwa  Last week’s Ethereum Merge drew 40,000 viewers to one popular viewing party, but the long-awaited shift to a faster, more environmentally friendly proof-of-work protocol did little to impress many traders.  In a textbook sell-the-news scenario, traders sent ether prices tumbling more than 15% during the past week. The decline has dovetailed with plunging equity markets and rumblings in the Twittersphere about possible centralization of the Ethereum network.  “Lido and Coinbase alone represent just under 45% of total validation,” Paul McCaffrey, crypto strategist at KBW, highlighted in an email to CoinDesk. “Lido leads at 30.1% with ~ 4.16M ETH, followed by Coinbase at 14.5% with >2M ETH.”  Ether’s decline has raised fundamental questions about Ethereum’s future. While optimism runs high about the platform’s potential long-run benefits, some prominent observers also have concerns that the Merge will create new obstacles.  A lure for ESG investors?  McCaffrey said he remained “in the bullish camp” over the medium to long term as more network validators join the network and alleviate such concerns over time.  “The Merge represents a landmark industry event and has the potential to draw ESG investors into the mix who will appreciate the energy efficient angles and the opportunity ETH brings to the masses (especially the unbanked),” he explained.  Others shared the sentiment, saying they viewed the Merge as a long-term indicator of strong fundamentals, despite recent price hiccups.  “The Merge could be more of a longer-term playout in the price as the upgrade is likely to attract more institutions, which could benefit ETH/USD price over a longer term,” Austin Kimm, director of strategy at Choise, said. “Ethereum is still the granddaddy of all blockchains with approximately half of all tokens being created on and using the network.”  A starting test  Elsewhere, Anto Paroian, executive director at the crypto hedge fund ARK36, told CoinDesk that Ethereum’s “big test” had only just begun.  “Although the proof-of-work and the proof-of-stake blockchains have successfully merged, only now would it be possible to discover the full impact of the Merge on the vast ecosystem of apps built on top of the Ethereum blockchain,” Paroian said, referring to the billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies locked up on Ethereum-based applications.  “This includes the [decentralized finance] space which is currently valued at around $56 billion. We should all be prepared for strong downside volatility in case of any glitches and previously unforeseen mishaps,” Paroian noted.  Apart from the near-term market and technological impact, some observers say ether is likely to receive legal scrutiny in the coming months due to the rewards that the network awards to users to run nodes, or specialized blockchain software, to process transactions on Ethereum.  “(There’s) the possibility of recognizing ETH as a security token. On the one hand, after the transition to PoS, the coin will have signs of [acting like a] security, such as, for example, the expectation of making a profit. And many financiers say that such an outcome is possible,"" Serhii Zhdanov, CEO of crypto exchange EXMO, said in a Telegram message.  Zhdanov warned that such an outcome would create a “disaster for ordinary users,” one that could even see “delisting of [tokens] from crypto exchanges” in the worst-case scenario.

After the asset consolidated for a few days, it finally travelled north. Over the last 24 hours, the XRP price registered a 6% appreciation. In the past week, the coin has rallied by over 20%. Buyers were attempting to push the price up, and they finally succeeded over the last 24 hours. XRP was stuck at the $0.38 price mark for a considerably long period of time, but buyers rescued the altcoin despite broader market weakness. Continued pressure from the buyers could make XRP move past its immediate resistance, which would make it invalidate its bearish thesis.
