42431222,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN17lh,1575676258,"SEC Reveals Telegram's Communications With Investors, Seeks to Question Advisor","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) wants Telegram’s former chief investment advisor to testify and hand over documents related to the company's $1.7 billion 2018 token sale.      The SEC has asked the High Court of England and Wales to obtain the testimony and documents from John Hyman, a former investment banker with Morgan Stanley and Renaissance Capital who resides in the U.K.      The trans-Atlantic request was revealed in a trove of documents filed by the SEC Friday with the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of New York. The agency is seeking to halt the launch of TON, Telegram’s ambitious blockchain project, and the issuance of TON’s tokens, named grams. The SEC considers grams unregistered securities – an allegation Telegram has repeatedly denied.      According to the Friday filing, the SEC is seeking Hyman’s testimony as he has been closely involved in raising funds for TON and communicated with “over a dozen” investors. Telegram CEO Pavel Durov described Hyman in January 2018 as the chief investment advisor at Telegram and the person who “runs the distribution of Grams,” the SEC says.      Hyman “communicated with Grams purchasers, confirmed transaction details, and provided ongoing updates to investors about investments.”    Eye on the grey market    The filing, relying on the company's email exchanges with U.S. investors, reveals some fundraising tactics used during Telegram’s unprecedented $1.7 billion token pre-sale.      For example, in one email, Hyman said that Telegram “decided for regulatory reasons that we will never do any form of direct public offering, … the public will be able to buy grams once network is working … not from Telegram directly.”      Writing to Google Ventures’ Blake Byers in May 2018, Hyman said there would be a third private round, in addition to the two completed in February and March – the plans that apparently got shelved at some point.      The advisor has been also keeping an eye on the grey secondary market for grams that emerged immediately after the first round of sales in February 2018, the filing says.      Although TON investors were strictly forbidden to resell their allocations under the threat of losing their future grams, the secondary market, in fact, flourished, with multiple offerings from small exchanges, brokers and individual OTC dealers, as CoinDesk previously reported.      According to the communications between Hyman and one of the investors’ representatives, Telegram’s advisor would regularly ask for updates on the secondary market of grams. “Hi Stan have you seen any grey market gram activity if so at what prices,” one of Hyman’s emails read.    Durov's mail    The filing contains, among other attachments, an email exchange between Telegram CEO Pavel Durov and some of the prospective TON investors in the beginning of 2018. For example, in January 2018, Durov scheduled a meeting between himself, Hyman and the investment firm Kleiner Perkins’ partner Mamoon Hamid in London.      The communication between Durov and Hamid started in October 2017, when Hamid was introduced to Durov by a person named Jared Leto – it’s unclear if the popular singer and actor himself was involved. However, the person used the email hosted on the celebrity’s official website Jaredleto.com. A request for comment from Leto's agent was not immediately returned.      Durov asked Hamid about his interest in investing in blockchain tech and said that he had to cancel his U.S. trip as the gram presale “reached 2x oversubscription too soon.”      Hamid, in turn, told Durov that blockchain was “an active area of interest for me and K[leiner]P[erkins]. At my previous firm, Social Capital, we invested 2% into BTC in 2013 and we were one of the biggest investors in the DCG (Digital Currency Group) since 2011,” Hamid wrote.      Apart from Kleiner Perkins, Durov introduced Hyman as Telegram’s chief investment advisor to other potential investors, including the founder of Insight Venture Partners Jerry Murdock, Dave Munichiello of Google Ventures, Pete Briger from Fortress Investment Group, Yosuke Sasaki and Rajeev Misra of Softbank.    Reluctant witness    The SEC asked the U.S. court to issue a Letter of Request to the Senior Master of the High Court (Queen’s Bench Division) of England and Wales, requesting the deposition of Hyman, a UK citizen who is currently residing there, the filing says. The procedure is possible thanks to the Hague Convention, which allows courts to seek evidence and testimonies beyond their own jurisdictions, the filing says.      Hyman won’t meet the SEC voluntarily, the filing says, this is why the court should be seeking the help of the overseas judicial system. Initially, SEC attorney Jorge Tenreiro reported contacting Hyman’s counsel, Greg Campbell, in London and got a response that Hyman agreed to appear voluntarily for a deposition.      However, after that “Mr. Campbell has refused to return multiple phone calls and emails regarding Mr. Hyman’s deposition,” so the SEC decided to get the British court involved. The last emails sent between Tenreiro and Campbell attached to the filing are dated Nov. 27.      In addition to Hyman’s testimony, the SEC is also seeking to obtain his written communications with Telegram’s leadership and investors, documents about his employment at Telegram and his own investment in grams.      According to the SEC information, Hyman left his job at Telegram and is now working at Gram Vault, the custodian for grams that earlier claimed to be working with TON’s largest investors. Gram Vault has also negotiated the listing of grams at the crypto exchange Poloniex, explaining that Telegram itself can not do so.      Working at Gram Vault, Hyman also helped to establish a connection with the crypto custodian Anchorage, which was expected to be Telegram’s partner serving U.S. customers, according to his email exchange with the company. Anchorage wasn't immediately available for comment.    Exemption unavailable    The filing also expands on the SEC’s reasoning about why it believes grams are unregistered securities, despite Telegram’s arguments to the contrary and the fact that it reported the offering as exempt under Regulation D.      According to the SEC, Telegram claimed that the Grams Purchase Agreements (SAFT contracts) were exempt from registration requirements but did not claim the same for the gram tokens themselves. Plus, “in any event, the exemption from registration under Regulation D is not available to Telegram,” the filing says.      Insisting that grams were securities by design, the SEC writes that Telegram allowed the investors to buy grams with a goal to later resell them with profit on a broad secondary market and did not take steps against that.      “Telegram’s marketing materials reasonably led purchasers of Grams to view them as an investment into a common enterprise from which they could hope to profit based on Telegram’s efforts to develop a business,” the SEC said. As a result, the investors “acquired substantial quantities of Grams that would far exceed any purported use of the Grams in whatever ecosystem Telegram promised in the future.”      Previously, the court ordered the depositions of Telegram's CEO Pavel Durov, vice president Ilya Perekopsky and investor relations officer Shyam Parekh. Telegram had to postpone the launch of its TON blockchain this October due to the lawsuit from the SEC.      The company is expected to meet the SEC in court on February 18-19, 2020.",NEGATIVE,TON,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TON,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2019/12/06/sec-reveals-telegrams-communications-with-investors-seeks-to-question-advisor,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d05f4036333f8e9a44c3a278f4d28b231a080a44-1200x795.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431215,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN17Zh,1575656104,State Street: 38% of Clients Will Put More Money into Digital Assets in 2020,"The majority of asset managers that bank with State Street are interested in digital assets such as bitcoin, but none have asked the global custodian to store them yet.       “We’re talking to them less about ‘Can you custody this,’ and more about how we can work together to make sure these changes aren’t disruptive to our business models,” said Jay Biancamano, State Street’s managing director of digital product development and innovation.       The firm will have a better idea of what it will do with digital asset custody in 2020, he said at an event sponsored by the bank Thursday in New York. After custody, State Street is interested in looking at fund administration, private placements, issuance and trading of digital assets, he said.       Despite their lack of interest in a custody solution, the Boston-based bank’s clients are continuing to invest more in the new asset class.       According to a survey to be released next week, 94 percent of State Street clients hold digital assets or related products (e.g. bitcoin futures) and 38 percent of them said they will increase their allocation of digital assets in 2020. Forty-five percent said their allocation would stay the same, according to the survey, conducted for the bank this year by quantitative analysis firm Oxford Economics.       State Street is embracing digital assets as it retrenches from an effort to retrofit its plumbing using distributed ledger technology (DLT), a sign that Wall Street is moving away from the mid-decade mantra of “blockchain not bitcoin.”       Earlier this year, the bank laid off more than 100 blockchain developers. This team’s responsibilities were separate from that of Biancamano’s team, however, which focuses on working with clients and third parties around digital asset and tokenization proofs of concept.       “Being able to provide custody and servicing around digital assets is different than building our entire backend infrastructure and prioritizing our technology stack to support Hyperledger blockchain,” Biancamano said. “They were parallel paths. ... We can continue to pursue digital assets and go into that business should we need to without having to have a number of DLT engineers. We still have the expertise on staff, but we put less emphasis on the infrastructure piece and more emphasis on the digital asset piece.”       The survey, based on a sample of 101 primarily US-based asset managers and owners, also showed that 62 percent of clients said tokenization will improve risk management and 55 percent said it will enhance security, though only 36 percent said it would democratize investing for retail investors or increase liquidity.      The firm’s clients may also be more bullish on DLT than State Street is. More than half of the respondents (62 percent) said that the technology will be integrated into their trading process in 2020; only half said the same for artificial intelligence. Sixty-five percent said that DLT will improve financing products.       Forty-five percent of survey respondents also said they believe that a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) will receive U.S. regulatory approval in 2020. However, similar vehicles are already available for big-money investors, Biancamano noted.       “Honestly, institutions already have the ability to invest in these funds,” he said. “VanEck is doing a private placement. WisdomTree announced the ability to invest on the Swiss exchange. I would like to see regulators become more comfortable with a bitcoin ETF… but I think the ability to invest in bitcoin in a fund or directly is there.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/12/06/state-street-38-of-clients-will-put-more-money-into-digital-assets-in-2020,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eb031291e2386b41b88f8e5978dbd4408c69de4d-1500x856.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The bank announced Friday that it completed pricing and issuance of the bonds for the first period this week and the two-year bond will come to the market with 3.25% coupon rate, according to a statement. The bank aims to raise funds to support these businesses.      “We have used our own blockchain-based bond issuance system in the process,” the bank said in the statement. “This is also the first bond issuance ledger system that is based on blockchain in the country.”      The bank used its own blockchain system to issue digital certificates that prove ownership, form groups of underwriters and document proof of transactions.      The bond issuance is part of the country’s effort to support entrepreneurs with more efficient access to capital. As of September, the bank has lent 404 billion yuan ($57.7 billion) to more than 410,000 small and micro sized enterprises, the bank said.      Financing for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) has been one of the major blockchain use cases for banks and financial services companies in China.      Industrial and Commerce Bank of China (ICBC), the largest bank by assets in the world, started to offer factoring services (transactions where a business sells account receivables to a third party at a discount in return for immediate cash payment) to SMEs on their blockchain platform in February 2018.      Ant Financial, the fintech arm of tech giant Alibaba, announced it would launch its own blockchain platform to provide SMEs with more reliable financial services in three month.

42431229,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN17xh,1575640816,Asset Manager Secures SEC Approval to Create Novel Bitcoin Futures Fund,"The New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG) has secured approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer institutional investors shares of a new fund focused on bitcoin futures.      According to a filing published on an SEC database Monday, the NYDIG Bitcoin Strategy Fund, a portfolio fund in the Stone Ridge Trust VI, will invest in cash-settled bitcoin futures contracts traded on exchanges registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The fund does not intend to invest in bitcoin directly, or any other cryptocurrencies.      “The Fund will seek to purchase a number of Bitcoin futures so that the total value of the Bitcoin underlying the Bitcoin futures held by the Fund is as close to 100% of the net assets of the Fund (the “Target Exposure”), as it is reasonably practicable to achieve,” the filing said.      It cautioned that “there can be no assurance that the Fund will be able to achieve or maintain the Target Exposure.”      NYDIG, which received a BitLicense and a limited purpose trust charter from the New York Department of Financial Services last year, is looking to raise $25 million through the fund.      At press time, CME is the only exchange to offer cash-settled bitcoin futures contracts in the U.S. (while Bakkt intends to offer cash-settled bitcoin futures starting next week, they will trade on ICE Singapore).      The SEC has long been loathe to approve certain fund products touching cryptocurrencies – exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as the main example. However, Monday’s approval may signal a slight shift in its stance.      Indeed, Dalia Blass, director of the SEC's Division of Investment Management, appeared to reference the fund in a speech earlier this week, calling it “a prime example” of industry engaging with the agency on new types of products.      “Last year, I issued a public letter calling on the fund industry to engage in a dialogue on the investor protection and substantive issues presented by such investments,” she said.      These issues included valuation, custody, liquidity, arbitrage efficiency and potential manipulation. The letter called for funds to find ways of answering these questions.      “As a result of this engagement, we are at the point that a registered closed-end interval fund with a bitcoin futures strategy is preparing to launch,” she said. “To reach this point, the fund first responded to each of the issues identified in the staff letter.”      While Blass did not identify the NYDIG fund by name, she noted that it would invest in cash-settled bitcoin futures, meaning it does not face crypto custody issues, and would value its holdings using the settlement price on a CFTC-registered futures exchange.      She touted other aspects of the fund as examples of how it addresses her previously stated concerns.      SEC Commissioner Hester Peircetook to Twitter to praise the approval, calling it “a bit of progress.”      NYDIG declined to comment on the fund through a spokesperson.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/06/asset-manager-secures-sec-approval-to-create-novel-bitcoin-futures-fund,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/105d89047666adaca8bdd763c7cf39a39ff48368-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431235,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN187h,1575638334,"Key Bitcoin Price Indicator Turns Bearish, But It May Not Be Bad News","View  Bitcoin’s monthly MACD histogram, a lagging indicator, has turned bearish for the first time since May.  A break below the recent low of $6,511 is needed to validate the MACD’s bearish turn. That level may come into play if prices find acceptance under the Dec. 4 low of $7,087.  A UTC close above $7,087 (Nov. 29 high) would revive the short-term bullish outlook.    A widely followed long-term bitcoin chart indicator has turned bearish for the first time since May.      The monthly MACD (moving average convergence divergence) histogram, an indicator used to identify trend changes and gauge trend strength, has crossed below zero to indicate a bullish-to-bearish trend change in prices.      Some observers have called the MACD’s bearish turn bad news for bitcoin. The indicator, however, is based on 12- and 26-month exponential moving averages (EMAs) and tends to lag prices.      Therefore, the latest bear cross has limited predictive powers and is more a confirmation or result of the prevailing bearish trend as represented by the sell-off from the June high of $13,880 to the November low of $6,500.      A popular Twitter analyst going by the name of ""Mr. Anderson"" (@TrueCrypto28) told CoinDesk that, as the the monthly MACD is a lagging indicator, traders should focus on smaller time frames.      ""Even if we are about to interpret it as bearish, that is coming after a mover from $14K to $7k and is woefully late,"" Mr. Anderson said. ""If someone likes the MACD, the weekly is plenty proficient. And the daily would do you just fine as well.""      Some analysts may argue that monthly MACD crossovers have proved reliable in the past. For instance, BTC dropped sharply in 2014 and 2018 following bearish crossovers of the histogram.      Monthly chart    The MACD’s move below zero in July 2018 was followed by three months of sideways trading and a sharp slide to levels below $4,000 in November.      On similar lines, in 2014, bitcoin fell from $490 to $150 in the five months following the confirmation of the bear cross in August.      Even so, the latest crossover should not demoralize the bulls, as the broader market conditions are different today than those in the above instances.      Back in 2014 and 2018, bitcoin was coming off record highs and, with the histogram’s bearish turn, traders likely found a reason to take profits or sell the cryptocurrency.      This time, the MACD’s shift is not preceded by record highs: the cryptocurrency topped out at $13,880 (well short of the lifetime high of $20,000) at the end of June.      More importantly, the 52 percent drop seen over the last five months is widely being viewed as a corrective move in a broader uptrend from lows near $4,000 seen in early April. Additionally, there are signs of seller exhaustion on the technical charts.    3-day chart    Bitcoin charted a classic long-tailed hammer candle in the three days to Nov. 26, signaling bearish exhaustion near six month lows. The cryptocurrency posted a strong bullish follow-through in the following three days, confirming a bullish reversal.      The short-term bullish case weakened with Wednesday’s strong rejection at $7,800, however. Prices are still holding above $6,511, even so, meaning signal of seller exhaustion is still valid.      The monthly MACD’s bearish reading would gain credence only if prices find acceptance below $6,511.    Daily chart    A UTC close above the Nov. 29 high of $7,870 is needed to invalidate the lower-highs setup and revive the short-term bullish case. A bullish close, if confirmed, would open the doors for $8,500.      On the downside, $7,087 is key support. A drop below that level would validate an inverted bearish hammer created on Dec. 4 and likely invite stronger selling pressure leading to a drop to recent lows near $6,500.

Enjin coin (ENJ) started to rise sharply from Wednesday afternoon (UTC) as news spread of a rewards scheme from the tech giant that uses Enjin technology and the ethereum blockchain. Known as Azure Heroes, the scheme rewards community members with crypto collectibles (or NFTs) for good deeds, such as mentoring, providing demos, creating content and more.      This is Enjin’s second major news-based rally this year, after Samsung added Enjin's cryptocurrency to the Blockchain Keystore on its flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S10, in March.      At the time, prices rose by more than 70 percent on rumors surrounding the release. Since then, ENJ has declined from a high of around $0.25 down to as low as $0.046 on Nov. 29.      With the latest Microsoft-fueled rally, price peaked at around $0.1059 on Friday morning (UTC), CoinMarketCap data shows. A press time, the rally looks to be losing steam slightly, with prices down to $0.0987.      Daily chart      As seen above, price action for ENJ had been stuck between two defined areas of support and resistance, between $0.051 and $0.068 for a period of about 72 days.      In all likelihood, Enjin coin bulls were beginning to grow thirsty for more developments to light a fire under prices. Now it would seem their prayers have been answered with the sharp breakout prompted by this week's news.      Rico Solo, a long-time investor in small-cap coins and an ENJ trader said he plans to take around 25 percent profit on this rally to guard against further downside risk in prices.

Since Libra was announced in June, much to the chagrin of the globe's regulators and central banks, Mnuchin indicated he's met with Facebook a dozen times to talk over regulatory concerns. That's slowed the pace of the payments project's move toward launch, he said.      Libra will be a stablecoin for payments through Facebook platforms and other wallets and products and is likely to be pegged to a basket of national currencies and government bonds.

42431231,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN181h,1575630000,Microsoft Is Using Blockchain to Help Firms Trust AI,"Microsoft is pitching blockchain technology as a way to make artificial intelligence less scary for its corporate customers.      Much like consumers who are wary of AI, enterprises are queasy about putting their full trust in a “black box” where machine learning algorithms are indiscriminately applied to vast data sets. But Microsoft, which helps thousands of firms manage their data, claims a blockchain can add trust and a degree of transparency, assuaging such concerns.      Underpinning this is a new tool called Azure Blockchain Data Manager, which the software giant released at its annual Ignite conference in Orlando, Florida, but was overshadowed by the announcement of a platform for creating enterprise tokens.      Blockchain Data Manager takes on-chain data and connects it to other applications. So transaction data from nodes or inside smart contracts can be sent to other databases or data stores. These are the sort of places where AI can be deployed, or in the case of supply-chain, where internet-of-things (IoT) information can be brought to bear.      ""From manufacturing to energy to public sector to retail, AI is digitally transforming businesses in every vertical,” said Marc Mercuri, principal program manager for blockchain engineering for Microsoft Azure, the company’s cloud computing business. “Blockchain can ensure that everything from the algorithms to the data going in and out of them is trustworthy.""      Acting as a trust anchor for downstream data analytics might sound like a rather abstract and modest innovation for blockchain. But blockchain on its own has shown few tangible benefits among companies that rode the initial wave of hype.      Data trail      A distributed ledger can be used to look at the provenance of data before AI parses it, Mercuri said. “Where did it come from? Where was it transformed? What was the code used to transform that? What was the input and the output of that transformation?”      The concept is plausible to Avivah Litan, a vice president and distinguished analyst at Gartner Research.      Blockchain, AI and IoT could be combined in the tracking of shipments of organic beef from Argentina, for example, she said.      In this case, the blockchain would allow participants to agree on all the conditions and exact location of the shipment, informing the distribution strategy further down the line, which is where AI might come in.      “Now, you could do that without blockchain,” said Litan, “but with blockchain you get a shared, single version of truth and an immutable audit trail so it's a much better source of data to feed your AI models.”       Microsoft’s data manager is designed to be “ledger-agnostic,” meaning it could be used with various types of blockchains, although the company’s forays in the sector have traditionally been linked to ethereum, including enterprise versions like JPMorgan’s Quorum.      Test customer      One of Microsoft’s customers, Icertis, a cloud-based platform for contract management, tried out Blockchain Data Manager “in preview,” prior to the release at Ignite, and built use cases involving ethical supply chain contracts and the way certain subsidized pharmaceutical drugs are used. Icertis used Quorum for the Data Manager builds, but the firm has used R3's Corda as its main blockchain previous to that.      An example that demonstrates the concept of trusted AI involves contracts that include a limitation of liability or a particular type of disaster recovery clause, for instance. By feeding data into an AI model, the level of risk for the end-user, if they agree to the contract terms, can be predicted.      Monish Darda, CTO and co-founder of Icertis, said the aim was to show the end-user what made the AI reach its conclusion, proving that it was not prone to any kind of data-led bias.      “I can go in and see what data was used to reach that decision,” said Darda.      “If my model is trained from that data, it gives me a transaction ID or a hash of the transaction written in the blockchain, and I can then go deep and say, ‘hey, two years ago I got these 10 data points that I used in my machine learning model, that influenced my calculation of risk’,” he said.      KPMG too      Big Four consultancy KPMG also has a blockchain-based trusted AI release slated for January.      Arun Ghosh, U.S. Blockchain Leader at KPMG, said a large part of machine learning is not data science but data engineering.      “It’s cleaning and collating and integrating information, and then you run the algorithm,” he said. ”What we are finding is that you can compress the data engineering process by adding a trusted layer that is immutable by nature.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/12/06/microsoft-is-using-blockchain-to-help-firms-trust-ai,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/97efb2520cea3cd340ad3d16480b81c8a5c4d67d-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431224,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN17jh,1575626400,Four Insights on Crypto Liquidity From Binance US and FTX,"The Takeaway  Trading fees are going to come down  Dinky coins matter to bitcoin liquidity  Market data is never reliable  Nothing in crypto is ""institutional grade""    Fragmented markets are a salient feature of the crypto asset class. Nowhere else does a single asset trade across so many small pools of liquidity.      Bitcoin itself could be considered a thinly traded asset, and this market structure makes it difficult to agree upon a bitcoin price--let alone to prevent manipulation or move large amounts of the asset without paying slippage costs.      To get at the heart of this problem, CoinDesk Research's webinar series brought in the chief executives of two young crypto exchanges. Catherine Coley is CEO of Binance US, the US arm of one of the largest crypto spot exchanges by liquidity and volume. Sam Bankman-Fried is CEO of Alameda Research, a quantitative trading firm based in Hong Kong that earlier this year started up FTX, a crypto derivatives exchange. Both exchanges have shown some fast early growth and attracted attention from crypto pundits and traders.      Here are four takeaways from our conversation with Sam and Catherine. For the full digest, sign up and listen to the entire webinar and check out our other live conversations at coindesk.com/webinars.    1. RIP good times (for exchanges)    Ask anyone to list the top firms on Wall Street, and what names would you expect to hear? ICE, the firm that operates the NYSE, is an admirable company, but you'd be surprised to hear it named on that list.      In crypto, it's exactly the opposite, Bankman-Fried pointed out during our conversation. Exchanges are the biggest, the deepest-pocketed and among the most influential crypto firms operating today. In part, that's because bitcoin and ethereum aren't firms. In part, it's because of crypto's immaturity: speculating on the speculative activity of others is the only use case that's really been proven; it's turtles, all the way down, as the old theological joke goes.      Crypto exchanges rule the roost because of their fee structure: 1 percent trading fees are typical, something you'd never see on a stock brokerage. (Discount firms like Schwab offer zero-commission trading, these days.) However, there are ways in which crypto's fee structure is friendlier than other asset categories, Coley pointed out.      ""I blame and credit my experience on the FX desk for making me realize some of the largest money movers out there pay nothing,"" she said. ""Whereas myself when I was on my desk moving Hong Kong dollars in to US dollars for, say, Christmas gifts or travel, I was paying 8 percent...on a currency that's pegged. That was hard to digest.""      Volume discounts also exist in crypto, but perhaps not to the same degree. Buying and holding so-called exchange tokens offers a sort of a loyalty program for traders looking for lower fees. Still, Coley said, for many, 1 percent fees are a barrier to entry. Exchanges are able to charge those rates today, perhaps due to FOMO (fear of missing out) or the novelty of the crypto asset category. Neither Bankman-Fried nor Coley expect those rates to last.    2. Bitcoin needs dogecoin    To attract order book depth both Binance US and FTX have added a long tail of thinly traded crypto assets.      Binance US began operations in September with seven markets and at the time of our webinar listed some two dozen. The chart above is just a 24-hour snapshot, but it shows how small some of these markets are by volume. Despite their diminutive size, they are an important driver of volume and liquidity into the larger markets on the exchange, both Coley and Bankman-Fried said.      It's ""Come for the shitcoins, stay for the bitcoin,"" Bankman-Fried said.      Options for trading in smaller-cap crypto assets are limited, he said. An investor wishing to trade in them will incur the capital costs, time and risk of onboarding to a new exchange. In larger-cap crypto assets like bitcoin and ether, it's harder to differentiate.    3. Believe nothing you hear, and only one half that you see    Recently, CoinDesk Research analyzed alleged bitcoin price manipulation, focusing on what is possible, or likely, when a relatively liquid market depends on a relatively illiquid market. FTX faces this problem from one side, as a derivatives market that relies on price data from less-liquid spot markets. Binance US faces it from the other, as a provider of price data to traders.      According to Bankman-Fried, there's no easy way around it. Derivatives markets must build indexes with many component spot markets, because they are likely to be ingesting erroneous or manipulated price data from exchanges, and there is no way to filter the good from the bad. Prices move so unpredictably in bitcoin and other crypto asset markets that it is impossible to distinguish fake pricing data from real.    4. No, you may not have the keys to the car    Since 2017 and before then, bitcoin bagholders have been hyping the ""institutional"" capital that is waiting on the sidelines for...something. Custody. Derivatives. Trading on credit.      The truth is, bitcoin markets, and markets in any other crypto asset, are not ready to meet the expectations of institutional asset managers.      Bankman-Fried, whose firm Alameda Research acts as a market-maker on FTX and other exchanges, said he's no longer surprised by the gaps in market structure he encounters when engaging with a new exchange. Some have low withdrawal limits; others have long withdrawal times. Others have risk checks that flag institutional accounts too frequently. Many, he said, have API rate limits of 10 queries per second, or less. That means on an exchange that lists 100 markets, it would take an institution 10 seconds just to find out its open orders.      Coley, from the other side of the table, agreed. ""Seeing how institutions expect markets to behave, there's a lot more that needs to be done,"" she said.

42431228,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN17zh,1575622800,Kadena Blockchain Taps Healthcare Data Firm to Track Medical Cannabis Product,"The first application on Kadena’s public blockchain is a tracking platform for CBD oil.      The platform is expected to launch after Kadena’s smart contract becomes fully functional on Jan. 15, 2020.      The cannabis project is only the first step for Kadena to tap into the multibillion-dollar healthcare industry, Will Martino, the firm’s CEO, said in an interview.      “We have much greater visions that include putting together a much larger healthcare data marketplace,” Martino said.      In the long term, Kadena hopes to achieve this goal via a partnership with Raleigh, N.C.-based Rymedi, a technology firm that provides data services for pharmaceutical, healthcare and other life-sciences companies and institutions.      In particular, Kadena and Rymedi could provide clients with an immutable and auditable record-keeping platform that could accelerate the drug approval process with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).      Consumers will be able to scan QR codes on products and look up production records. Using prospective consumer feedback, Martino said Kadena could launch a similar platform for prescription drugs in the future.      “This validates purchasing and authenticity, especially useful in geographies and industries where fraud and quality concerns remain potentially life-threatening issues,” Kadena said in a statement.      In April, Rymedi became one of the members of an FDA-approved consortium to study the use of blockchain technology to track and verify specialty prescription drugs in several U.S. states with a focus on intra- and inter-health system medication transport and usage.      “With their deep experience in financial markets and transaction data, Kadena is a uniquely aligned partner for us,” Rymedi CEO David Stefanich said in a statement.      Kadena claims to have one of the most scalable proof-of-work platforms for facilitating cross-chain transactions. The firm announced mining on its mainnet had begun on Nov.4 with plans to raise an additional $20 million in a November token sale.      The firm will enable miners to trade KDA tokens on Dec. 17.

42431208,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN147h,1575590404,Multicoin Capital Hires Principal in Asia as Crypto VCs Look East,"As American cryptocurrency markets remain relatively subdued, investors are turning to Asia for fresh lifeblood.      Case and point, Multicoin Capital just hired Beijing-based investor Mable Jiang, formerly of Nirvana Capital, to spearhead the venture firm’s hunt for new deals in Asia.      The Texas-based Multicoin started publishing research reports and announcements in Mandarin last summer, so Jiang will also help “capitalize on the structurally broken information flow for secondary-market investment,” the company said in a blog post shared with CoinDesk.      “I think we’ll see a wave of really interesting China-native projects and dapps come to market next year,” Jiang said. “We also believe a global presence is one of the best ways to deliver more sophisticated views to people in different markets.”      Multicoin is merely one of many American crypto hedge funds and venture capital firms seeking a foothold in token-hungry markets like China and Korea. For example, Polychain Capital increased its investment in the Chinese token project Nervos, alongside China Merchants Bank International, and sent partners to travel in Asia for a variety of meetings.      “Several firms have asked us for help in sourcing Asia partners and employees,” Dragonfly Capital’s Alexander Pack said in August. “Asia leads the world in crypto users and adoption by a mile – it’s not even close.”      Despite reports of a Chinese regulatory crackdown, which crop up routinely but have yet to quell demand, SimilarWeb indicates more than half of the traffic for the crypto exchange Huobi comes from mainland China in addition to 35 percent of the global traffic to OKEx. As of October, SimilarWeb shows Korea was the fourth greatest source of traffic for the token-centric site Etherscan, behind China and the United States, with the Korean exchange Bithumb listed as the third most popular referral site in the world.      However, Electric Capital co-founder Avichal Garg said he helms one of the few Silicon Valley funds not looking to expand in Asia because it is “such a different universe” that requires significant resources to address sustainably.      “You see a lot of trade volume. A lot of the pushing of boundaries is coming out of Asia, in part because the regulatory climate there is different,” Garg said. “But most [funds] are hiring more junior talent [in Asia], which I think is a mistake. … Dragonfly is potentially doing this the best where they have extremely high caliber people in both geographies.”    Bridge-building    Jiang may bein the first half of her career trajectory, but she also said she has a unique opportunity to leverage local knowledge.      “Localization is absolutely a key component in the accuracy and speediness of judgment,” she said. “For a fund to manage a ‘global’ asset, it has to connect the geographic dots and seek to understand the behaviors driving each investment culture.”      In a letter sent to Multicoin’s investors last month, the firm said, ""a significant amount of information travels through word of mouth, WeChat groups, and Mandarin-only social media properties."" As such, the letter said, Mable’s job will be to close the information gap.      In some ways, this renewed Asia push is a continuation of a trend that started during the 2018 bear market, when BlockTower Capital became one of the first funds to shift strategies by hiring multilingual Goldman Sachs alumni Steve SeungKeun Lee.      On the other hand, Jiang said this isn’t a trend; it’s a new way to look at stateless assets. From her perspective, crypto requires diverse investors with local cultural competence contributing to a mosaic approach.      “Crypto is one of the few assets that is truly ‘global,’” she said. “I think the biggest misconception is the urge to generically stereotype things with a tag of ‘east’ or ‘west.’”      Ada Hui contributed reporting.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/06/multicoin-capital-hires-principal-in-asia-as-crypto-vcs-look-east,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/95edd43566f02dd4c88119352a358049fe1f1c9e-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
