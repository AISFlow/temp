Here’s what’s happening:  Market moves: Bitcoin stabilized above $42,000, although investors continued to monitor tensions on the Ukraine border and inflationary data.  Technician's take: BTC upside appears limited as buyers lose momentum.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $42,727 +1.1%  Ether (ETH): $2,941 +2.1%  Top Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Internet Computer ICP +5.0% Computing Solana SOL +3.4% Smart Contract Platform Cosmos ATOM +2.9% Smart Contract Platform  Top Losers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Dogecoin DOGE −5.1% Currency Ethereum Classic ETC −4.9% Smart Contract Platform XRP XRP −0.9% Currency  Markets  S&P 500: 4,401 -0.3%  DJIA: 34,566 -0.4%  Nasdaq: 13,790  Gold: $1,871 +0.7%  Market moves  After dropping sharply Friday, bitcoin found firm footing in the $42,000 to $43,000 range during U.S. trading hours as investors continued to hold their breath about a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine, particularly the implications for the global energy supply.  At the time of publication, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading just below $42,800, up slightly over the last 24 hours. Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was trading at above $2,900, up more than 2% over the the same time period. Major altcoins were mostly in the red. Trading was light.  Crypto's performance largely mirrored prices on major equity exchanges. The tech-focused Nasdaq composite was flat, the first trading day after it dropped more than 2% on Friday. The S&P 500 and DJIA were off slightly.  Oil prices have risen to $90 a barrel, their highest level since 2014, and a war that could mean sanctions on Russian production could send the price to over $100, a number of analysts have predicted. Natural gas prices jumped 6% on. Monday. ""The possibility of war between Ukraine and Russia has put oil prices on a one-way road higher,"" wrote Edward Moya, senior market analyst for The Americas OANDA.  Moya noted that crypto prices ""appears to be stabilizing,"" despite rising U.S. Treasury bond yields. ""Bitcoin has weathered the regulatory storm and China [mining] exit,"" Moya said. ""There's a strong belief that bitcoin is going to do well in a gradually increasing Treasury yield environment.  If tensions on the Ukrainian border decrease in the days ahead, Moya said investors will ""focus on U.S. economic data."" He said that Tuesday's Producer Price Index (PPI) report, the average change in the selling prices received by domestic producers for their goods and services, will ""be closely watched"" as a window on inflationary trends.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Weighed Down by $46K Resistance; Support at $35K-$40K  Bitcoin (BTC) was roughly flat over the weekend as price momentum continued to slow.  The cryptocurrency remains stuck below the $46,000 resistance level, although lower support at $35,000 and $40,000 could stabilize pullbacks over the short term.  The 50-day moving average was unable to demonstrate a positive slope over the past week, indicating continued selling strength. Indicators also approached overbought territory, which typically precede pullbacks in price, consistent with the downtrend since November.  For now, BTC upside appears to be limited as momentum signals remain negative on weekly and monthly charts.  Bitcoin was trading around $42,000 at press time and is down 3% over the past week.

42396032,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0Znc,1644878311,"Federal Judge Releases 'Razzlekhan,' Orders Other Bitfinex Hack Laundering Suspect to Remain in Jail","WASHINGTON, D.C. — A federal judge has ordered one half of the couple accused of laundering the proceeds of a 2016 Bitfinex hack to remain in federal custody until they face trial.  Prosecutors allege that Ilya Lichtenstein, 34, and his wife, Heather Morgan, 31, conspired together to launder 119,754 bitcoins – worth over $5 billion in today’s prices – that were stolen during the 2016 hack of Bitfinex. The couple faces two conspiracy charges each that could see them face up to 25 years in prison. A judge ruled Monday that Morgan could be released on bail under strict conditions, but Lichtenstein will remain in custody pending trial.  Monday’s decision, made by Beryl Howell, chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, overturns an earlier order made last week by a New York magistrate judge to allow the couple to be released on bond. Howell had already previously stayed the order on an emergency basis after the New York judge said they could be released on bail.  Howell sided with prosecutors’ position that the couple have both the motive and means to skip bail and flee the United States.  Earlier this month, federal agents seized approximately 94,000 bitcoins (worth over $3.6 billion) held in a wallet whose private keys were found in one of Lichtenstein’s cloud accounts. However, the government alleges the couple still has access to bitcoin worth over $300 million.  Prosecutors also say searches of the couple’s documents revealed evidence of the couple’s alleged plans to set up a life in Ukraine or Russia, including the establishment of financial accounts and phone numbers during a 2019 trip to Ukraine and files on Lichtenstein’s computer containing stolen Russian and Ukrainian identities, both male and female.  The ‘smoking gun’  At Monday’s pre-indictment hearing, Howell shut down allegations made by plaintiffs in documents filed last week that the case against Lichtenstein and Morgan was “flimsy,” that the blockchain tracing technology used to link them to the stolen funds was “confusing” and the evidence against them “circumstantial.”  “I totally disagree with that characterization [of the evidence],” Howell told Samson Enzer, an attorney for the defense.  Prosecutors told Howell, a crypto savvy judge, about the wallet, referred to as “S4,” containing $3.6 billion worth of bitcoin seized last week. Because the private keys were found in an encrypted file on Lichtenstein’s cloud account, the government alleges that the wallet must then have been in Lichtenstein’s control.  Howell concurred, telling the court she understood that crypto investors “jealously guard” their private keys.  “Defense counsel has argued that the government has not offered anything resembling direct evidence,” Howell told prosecutors. “Would you say finding the keys is pretty clear direct evidence?”  When prosecutors answered in the affirmative, Howell continued:  “Sort of like the smoking gun?”  The prosecutors confirmed, again.  Howell also asked prosecutors to expand on the alleged money laundering conspiracy, as well as what evidence the government had that the couple was in control of the remaining bitcoins not recovered in the seizure of S4’s contents.  They attempted to explain a complex web of transactions out of wallet S4 and into various wallets, exchanges and shell companies but claimed that many of them were “single transactions,” from the wallet controlled by Lichtenstein.  Prosecutors told Howell that approximately 7,500 missing bitcoins had been traced to 24 addresses believed to be controlled by the couple that the government has not yet been able to find. The bitcoins in most of the 24 wallets were “direct sends” from S4, prosecutors say.  “It appears they were setting up savings accounts,” prosecutors said of the wallets.  Morgan: Mastermind or ‘naive wife?’  Howell also considered the defense’s position that the case against Morgan was weaker than the case against Lichtenstein, and that the only evidence against her was she had “allegedly received funds that are tied to the act.”  Howell told prosecutors she wanted to address concerns Morgan was “some sort of a naive wife” who had no idea what her husband was doing.  Prosecutors told the court Morgan has a “graduate degree in economics,” was familiar with crypto and had taken an active role in the alleged money laundering conspiracy, lying to banks, crypto exchanges and her accountant about where the funds had come from and actively using her company to launder funds through Hong Kong-based shell companies. (Morgan used to live in Hong Kong, prosecutors pointed out).  Morgan would “absolutely have the ability and connections” to hide the remaining bitcoins and “disappear,” prosecutors told Howell.  Prosecutors also told the court Morgan’s startup, Salesfolk, despite allegedly being used to launder “hundreds of millions” worth of crypto from “non-existent customers for non-existent work that [Morgan’s] business hasn’t actually done,” had never been paid in crypto from a legitimate client.  Howell ultimately sided with the defense and agreed to release Morgan on bond, upholding the original conditions set by the New York magistrate judge last week.  Conditions include house arrest with no internet-connected devices, no cryptocurrency trading and a $3 million bond – including her parents’ home in Northern California, where Morgan’s parents have lived since 1997.  “I want an ankle bracelet,” Howell said.  Private islands and frozen embryos  Morgan’s list of health problems, including recent breast surgery, asthma (defense attorneys told the court that Morgan suffered a “serious asthma attack” over the weekend in jail because she had not been given an inhaler) and lung damage from a prior infection featured heavily in the defense’s argument that she should be released on bond.  Morgan’s struggle with endometriosis, which her attorneys told Howell led her to have her eggs frozen “several years ago,” was also referenced frequently by the defense.  The couple’s attorneys told Howell they had been preparing for in-vitro fertilization before the investigation began and had frozen embryos stored at a New York hospital.  “It’s the only realistic prospect of them having children,” Enzer told the court. “They would literally be leaving their future behind if they left.”  Howell pushed back, saying that if the couple had access to the $330 million prosecutors say they do, they could obtain quality health care in other countries.  Enzer also told Howell the lien against her parents’ house – their only asset – would serve as a “moral suasion” for her to cooperate with the court.  Prosecutors fired back, saying they didn’t doubt the sincerity of either Lichtenstein’s or Morgan’s parents, but “several hundred million dollars of crypto [could buy each set of parents] a private island.”  UPDATE (Feb. 15, 2022, 01:30 UTC): Updated with additional context from the hearing.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/02/14/federal-judge-releases-razzlekhan-orders-other-bitfinex-hack-laundering-suspect-to-remain-in-jail,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f20cac78701b8ee5439d8e59c1fb48137399c500-3264x2448.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The bullish Bitcoin narrative was put to the test this week as geopolitical tensions between Ukraine and Russia, as well as the likelihood of a 50 basis point Federal Reserve interest rate hike in March, weighed on the world&apos;s largest cryptocurrency. However, Bitcoin fundamentals show that BTC is still in upward momentum. Here are some factors to consider. Bitcoin Spot Price Exceeds Futures Interesting activity has been taking place in Bitcoin derivatives markets during the ascent to and fall from local highs. Open interest leverage has been evaporating from futures markets, as reported by Twitter observers including Glassnode chief analyst Checkmate, and with it the possibility of being deleveraged or &apos;liquidated.&apos; Checkmate tweeted Sunday alongside a chart showing the de-risking: &apos;Bitcoin futures leverage has fallen significantly this week, falling from 2.0% of Market cap, to 1.75%.

42396039,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0ZsX,1644873669,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Rangebound as Traders Hedge Risks,"Traders continue to monitor the conflict between Russia and Ukraine on Monday, which has weighed on equities and cryptocurrencies.  The U.S. announced it will temporarily relocate its embassy operations in Ukraine from Kyiv to Lviv, farther away from the Russian border, due to the ""dramatic acceleration in the buildup of Russian forces."" And Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zalenskyy said Wednesday – two days from now – will be the ""day of the attack,"" in a speech on Monday.  ""This fear is due to the uncertainty of war but also the fact that U.S. President Joe Biden has said he will shut down the Nord Stream 2 pipeline if Russia decides to invade,"" Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at the U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  Nord Stream 2 provides a significant portion of Europe’s natural gas, so a shutdown could cause oil prices to climb, which could result in higher inflation, according to Sotiriou. Central banks are tightening monetary policy to combat rising prices, which is a headwind for speculative assets such as cryptocurrencies.  Bitcoin (BTC) traded in a tight range between $41,000 and $42,000, while oil, gold and the U.S. dollar traded higher over the past 24 hours.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $42228, −0.61%    ●Ether (ETH): $2900, −0.32%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4402, −0.38%    ●Gold: $1873 per troy ounce, +1.76%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.00%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Traders seek protection  The bitcoin futures term structure, which reflects the market expectation on future implied volatility, has flattened through March. That could reflect uncertainty among crypto derivative traders.  Through the end of 2022, the term structure shows a very modest 6% annualized premium, ""suggesting the market is quite far from anticipating a wild bullish impulse any time soon,"" Glassnode stated in a blog post on Monday. Further, ""the market appears to be de-risking and curtailing leverage in response to the plethora of macro uncertainties.""  The chart below shows the recent increase in put options relative to call options, indicating greater demand for downside protection among bitcoin traders.  Crypto fund inflows rise  Crypto funds attracted $75 million of fresh investment last week, the fourth straight week of net inflows.  Ethereum funds saw their first inflows in 10 weeks, at $21 million. Meanwhile, bitcoin funds saw inflows of $25 million last week, a slower pace of growth compared with the $71 million of inflows the week before.  The inflows remain relatively minor in comparison to the inflows during the fourth quarter of 2021, according to CoinShares.  The firm noted that there were regional differences in the week's data, with $5.5 million of outflows in the Americas and $80.7 million of inflows into European investment products.

42396036,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0ZqZ,1644872105,Drained Crypto Accounts at IRA Financial Leave Victims Searching for Answers,"They joined IRA Financial Trust eager to build a nest egg in crypto. Instead, some users told CoinDesk their retirement accounts were drained, frozen and locked – with little explanation of what happens next.  It’s been nearly one week since an apparent security breach threw IRA Financial’s clients into crisis mode. With $36 million of their retirement savings in limbo and no full explanation from either IRA Financial or Gemini – the crypto exchange owned by the Winklevoss twins, Cameron and Tyler, and custodian where their crypto was held – they’ve begun organizing a response to crypto’s latest hack.  Users, appearing to count in the dozens, have begun reaching out to news organizations and regulators, wanting to know how they lost possibly millions of dollars on Feb. 8, when an apparent bad actor began withdrawing funds en masse from Gemini. IRA Financial Trust is one of a handful of firms that run their retirement account services atop Gemini’s institutional trading and custody suite.  The apparent victims tell CoinDesk they are trapped in a knotty morass of incomplete facts that only confound a fraught situation. Even basic details – how many accounts were breached, who (if anyone) will cover their losses – remain unclear. Some receive occasional terse email updates from IRA Financial while others are forced to call every day, users tell CoinDesk.  What’s clear is this: Around 5 p.m. ET last Tuesday an account labeled “Benjamin Choe'' began withdrawing bitcoin, ether and U.S. dollars from user accounts. One user said he lost 13 ETH, 1 BTC and thousands of dollars in a matter of minutes despite multiple account security layers, like two-factor authentication.  Gemini says it was not hacked; IRA Financial Trust has acknowledged an incident occurred and is investigating it, telling CoinDesk in an emailed statement the “suspicious activity” affected “a limited subset of our customers with accounts on the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange.”  “We are working closely with third-party forensic specialists to determine the nature and scope of this incident,” a spokesperson from IRA Financial’s hired crisis communications firm told CoinDesk.  Crypto IRAs  The incident is one of the first high-profile exploits to hit crypto retirement accounts in the U.S. Appealing to tax-savvy bitcoiners, this cottage industry has for the past few years hawked products in partnership with top crypto brands. For example, Directed IRA also works with Gemini; Kingdom Trust serves a number of competing products.  IRA Financial, a South Dakota Trust company, has told clients since 2019 that their retirement savings would be safe with its institutional accounts on Gemini, a crypto giant which operates under the New York BitLicense, the toughest digital asset regulatory regime in the U.S.  Tricky U.S. tax laws make setting up these institutional accounts far more complex than retail customer fare, especially in the retirement space. For starters, you can’t wholly control a self-directed IRA yourself. It has to be run through a third party like IRA Financial Trust that can attest your account is following IRS rules.  That didn’t bother “lucidBTC” a member of a Telegram group where Feb. 8 hack victims have gathered to strategize. A former Silicon Valley tech worker, he told CoinDesk he signed up for IRA Financial’s product specifically because it had partnered with Gemini, a company he’s traded with for years.  Deploying two-factor authentication and setting a list of whitelisted withdrawal addresses, he assumed his retirement crypto would be safe with Gemini. Statements from IRA Financial bolstered that view.  “You have total control over your cryptos,” IRA Financial CEO Adam Bergman said in a May 3, 2021, video walk-through of “Gemini IRA account” onboarding, which included linking the IRA Financial and Gemini accounts together. In a later video on crypto insurance, his company assured viewers that “Gemini is regulated and insured against theft, so your cryptos are protected.”  “We got in a car we presumed was safe,” lucidBTC said in a phone interview. Gemini was the car, with “safety belts, airbags and anti-lock brakes. And IRA Financial was the chauffeur. But the chauffeur fell asleep at the wheel and hit a tree.”  Now he and others in the Telegram group say they’ve lost over $2 million in crypto and cash.  “How can a financially regulated thing like a retirement account just move my money without any authorization?” he said.  Suspicious activity  Dozens of users began seeing unauthorized withdrawals on their Gemini accounts, victims told CoinDesk. One user, Jacob, who declined to give his last name, said he lost $20,000 in fiat to an account he did not control. Others described losing bitcoin and ether in full coin increments.  In an emailed statement, IRA Financial said it was investigating “the scope of the breach” and was attempting to recover funds. It said it had notified law enforcement. The company gave no details about the incident.  IRA Financial’s post-hack emails to customers have been equally mum.  But a memo distributed to customers on the morning of the breach hints that even hours before the hack, IRA Financial knew something was amiss.  “We have reason to believe that there are some bad actors posing as IRA Financial employees looking for crypto account-related information,” the email read. It warned users to remain wary of phishers.  Nearly 24 hours later IRA Financial gave a terse update:  “Late in the day on Tuesday, February 8, 2022, we believe we were targeted by hackers. To protect your assets and data, we took immediate actions to suspend access to your IRA Financial/Gemini accounts.”  Those defensive mechanisms appear to have been too little, too late for dozens of customers.  “Almost my entire Roth that I've had for over 20 years” was stolen, said one victim who had invested much of it in bitcoin and ether. Two other victims said they were locked out of their accounts; they can’t even see the damage. The full theft is likely well under $50 million, according to a source familiar with the situation.  Crypto tracing company Chainalysis confirmed the hack involved $36 million in cryptocurrencies.  Corporate response  Gemini’s emails to customers provide a somewhat clearer picture of what went down.  “Although our investigation remains ongoing, the facts discovered to date indicate that transfer requests were made by utilizing properly authenticated accounts controlled by IRA Financial Group, which were used to execute asset transfers to another account,” the firm wrote late Sunday night. “At the time, these requests complied with IRA’s approval processes and appeared to Gemini to be legitimate, authorized transactions. To date, our investigation has found no indication of any unauthorized access to your account resulting from any security failure or breach of Gemini systems.”  This finding would place the blame entirely on IRA Financial. It would also, in Gemini’s telling, absolve it of any responsibility to cover the loss with its own insurance policy. Gemini advised the customer to ask IRA Financial about its insurance policy.  By sheer happenstance, IRA Financial’s Bergman went in deep on the issue of crypto IRA insurance just last month.  “Are crypto IRAs insured?” he asked viewers on Jan. 28. “We’re insured,” Bergman said, referring to cash deposits covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC). He later implied that Gemini was responsible for covering the crypto deposits themselves.  IRA Financial's YouTube account took a harder stance in the video’s comments section:  “Technically, only cash is only FDIC insured at a bank. Gemini is not a bank, so the cash is technically not protected by FDIC insurance. However, the cash will likely not sit for long in your Gemini account, as you will be buying cryptos. Gemini is regulated and insured against theft, so your cryptos are protected.”  IRA Financial Trust did not respond to questions about whether it has crypto insurance.

42410933,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtSeq,1644869076,SEC Enforcement Against Wonderland Could Mean Trouble for DeFi,"When is DeFi truly decentralized? That question could soon be at the center of an SEC investigation.  One of the strangest stories in the history of decentralized finance (DeFi) may soon also count among the most legally significant, experts told CoinDesk in a series of interviews. According to multiple legal professionals, recent events could provide the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other agencies a long-awaited foothold in the largely unregulated, $211 billion DeFi sector.  In late January, noted on-chain sleuth ZachXBT revealed that the treasury manager for Wonderland, a popular DeFi protocol, was in fact Michael Patryn, a convicted felon and the co-founder of the fraudulent former Canadian cryptocurrency exchange QuadrigaCX.  Prior to the reveal, Patryn – then working under the pseudonym “Sifu” – and Wonderland founder Daniele Sestagalli grew notorious for aggressively leveraging one of DeFi’s trendiest new tools: Protocol Controlled Value, or PCV. According to the Wonderland documentation, PCV is a term for “the amount of funds the treasury owns and controls,” and the Wonderland treasury currently manages in excess of $700 million, down from a peak well over $1 billion.  Depending on how a protocol’s treasury is managed, PCV often undermines DeFi’s claims to decentralization.  Read more: How Did a Former Quadriga Exec End Up Running a DeFi Protocol? Wonderland Founder Explains  While some decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) leverage on-chain governance and votes directly and programmatically lead to fund disbursements, others simply use DAO token-holder votes as “signals” from the community to a centralized group of fund managers who theoretically may or may not choose to enact the community’s wishes – a dynamic that could draw the attention of regulators.  While Wonderland’s PCV was ostensibly owned by token holders, it was largely unilaterally managed by the Sestagalli and Patryn using only a multi-signature scheme for security – a common tool that requires multiple “signers” to approve transactions from a blockchain address.  For many who were skeptical about Wonderland’s centralized treasury management, Patryn’s unmasking was a clear example of why the sector should strive to avoid centralized intermediaries, pseudonymous or not.  According to a number of legal experts, however, it may also be exactly the case that the SEC has been looking for.  “If you’re the SEC, this is probably one of the better opportunities to get some precedent on the books that would at least let you start clawing into DeFi,” Collins Belton, a managing partner at Brookwood P.C., said in an interview with CoinDesk.  Belton “absolutely” expects there will be regulatory activity on the PCV front – the first of what could be a number of cases where agencies test the sector’s claims to decentralization, as the agency analyzes “whether they’re dealing with a securities instrument, or a vehicle that needs to be regulated under the Investment Company Act.”  The bizarre, headline-grabbing nature of the Wonderland incident could also “invite political will for enforcements,” said Ross Campbell, a legal engineer at LexDAO, which could ultimately accelerate the timeline on the SEC taking action.  Read more: Wonderland Founder: ‘I’m Here to Fix This and Make It All Back’  “I think in terms of how quickly this could happen, it could happen this year, honestly,” said Campbell.  DAO in name only  According to Belton, the trend of centrally-managed PCV is a sign of broader froth that permeated DeFi markets in late 2021, a period during which Wonderland reached a peak of well over $1 billion in PCV under Sestagalli and Patryn’s oversight.  It was a largely euphoric phase where “everybody kind of lost sight of fundamental values” such as decentralization and censorship resistance, he said.  “People kind of get away with that because there’s a lot of new entrants and they don’t have that prior training, and the experienced hands saw there was money to be made – ‘Oh hey, maybe this stuff never did matter at all because we’re all making money,’” said Belton.  Indeed, he noted that the PCV trend has been broadly referred to as DeFi, despite failing to live up to the label.  “Over the past year and a half, DeFi has become a term for anything related to finance in crypto. If anything, [centrally-managed PCV] is just unregulated traditional finance,” he added.  These distinctions aren’t merely a matter of ideology, however, and may in fact be a focal point for SEC enforcement.  “I very frequently bifurcate things [definitionally] in crypto along the lines of custodial or managerial decision-making on one side, and relinquishing those controls on the other,” Belton said. “Frequently, I think, to the extent that you get in front of a court willing to engage in a fundamental-based analysis, that’s oftentimes the dividing line for where the court’s assessment will be.”  Belton noted that central management of funds increases the likelihood that Wonderland’s TIME and wMEMO tokens could be considered a security, especially given how active and vocal Sestagalli was about his management as a perk of the protocol.  “[Regulators] will be looking at the manner in which people are managing the fund, or the extra layer of value on top of the token, that’s creating issues with respect to retail. People enter into these investments based on their efforts, and based on their involvement in the operation,” said Campbell.  Sestagalli failing to disclose Patryn’s identity could also prove to be a particular sticking point as well, as it was information that may have caused some investors to reassess their position.  “Often times what they’re looking at is, ‘Are there individuals that we can uniquely point to as providing the essential managerial efforts to either drive profit, to manage risk, that would be in possession of some type of information asymmetry they could uniquely take advantage of relative to the general public,’ et cetera,” Belton said.  Test case  These clear points of centralization and the lack of disclosures both dramatically increase the odds of the SEC using Wonderland as a “test case” to explore when a protocol’s claims to decentralization are not backed up in terms of the actual power distribution, said Campbell.  “The SEC or other, similar regulators in other jurisdictions might say, ‘This looks a lot like a centralized enterprise because effectively the checks and balances are not enforced by code.’ You have soft power via signal Snapshot voting, but the hard power is held by the multi-sig,” he said.  Indeed, over the past year the SEC has been threatening to establish a more active stance in the regulation of DeFi protocols, but so far has yet to take meaningful action – possibly due in part to the legal tangle created by decentralized decision making.  Read more: State of Crypto: The SEC Takes on DeFi  With many DeFi protocols, such as Uniswap v2 and Aave v1, once published the protocol operates entirely autonomously and is non-upgradable – it is impossible to ""take the protocol down,"" and their operation requires no oversight, leading to ambiguity concerning what practical steps regulatory agencies could take towards enforcement.  “Why there’s been a reticence to do more than send requests for information to DeFi companies is because part of the challenge is they have to come up with a legal theory that allows them to provide that, despite the fact that these people are not actually either taking affirmative action to facilitate or execute transactions, and they’re not exercising discretion or managerial decisions, they should still be liable and beholden to the users of these platforms – that’s actually very difficult in the United States,” said Campbell.  Belton also noted that some legal observers have argued that if a case was appealed in higher courts, including the Supreme Court, the current composition of the court is “radically pro-business” and “radically free speech-leaning,” which could make enforcement arguments against a more thoroughly decentralized entity difficult.  “They’ll always have an easier time going after select actors, versus going after a specific technology or going after thousands of people that might be involved in a DAO,” Campbell added.  By comparison, a handful of publicly known money managers are a significantly easier target. According to Belton, it prompts a simple question: “Do we go after these guys who are anon and make these novel legal arguments, or do they go after this identifiable human being who is actively calling his thing a SPAC, which we already regulate?”  Unlike with autonomous and decentralized protocols, there are more clearly-identifiable actors and steps for taking action against them.  “If you’re a Gary [Gensler], you’re saying, ‘Here’s an opportunity where a lot of things look more similar to a slam dunk to us than other protocols,’” added Campbell.  Building precedent  Adding further to the probability of enforcement action, the SEC has already established precedent with regard to investment DAOs.  “I have to remind people, the first significant thing the SEC did [in crypto] was the DAO report,” said Belton.  Read more: The DAO Report: Understanding the Risk of SEC Enforcement  Indeed, in 2017 the SEC released the now-landmark DAO report, in which it revealed it had been investigating the initial coin offering (ICO) of The DAO, an early collective investment experiment that failed after a hack in 2016.  While automated market makers (AMMs) and peer-to-pool lending markets may be new developments, in light of the DAO report, PCV is in some ways just a new term for structures that the SEC has extensive experience with. The first line of the SEC report even notes that parties related to organizing The DAO “may have violated the federal securities laws.”  “Way before Wonderland these guys were focused on treasuries managed by DAOs,” Belton said of SEC staffers. “Those are two things [treasury management and DAOs] that they are intimately familiar with and are things they think is within their purview.”  If and when the SEC successfully brings enforcement against Wonderland, however, it could be a stepping stone in pursuing other protocols, especially ones that build and manage treasuries in a centralized manner.  “That’s the goal of common-law jurisprudence. You want to build precedent you can build on,” said Belton.  Indeed, in a worst-case scenario for the industry, any protocol raising and managing treasury funds at all could eventually become targets if the SEC builds enough precedent, working their way into the industry over a period of years with successful enforcements.  “What Gary Gensler has said specifically about DeFi protocols, decentralized exchanges, and how token holders earn fees, that seems high on their list nowadays,” Campbell said of recent statements from the SEC chairman.  Self-enforcement  Ironically, many observers have pointed out that looming encroachment from the SEC may have been avoided if DeFi users demanded more thorough decentralization from the projects they invest in, as well-designed DAOs by nature give token holders and organizations methods to “clean up their own messes,” and investors often “have exit rights,” said Campbell.  “We need more effective on-chain governance and veto power by people who hold tokens. Those things together would allow more self-regulation against an enforcement action because the SEC tries to prioritize in terms of what brings the most bang for the buck and where they can make the most law by bringing an enforcement action,” Campbell added.  In a blog post, Inverse Finance founder Nour Haridy called on the Wonderland DAO to move away from the multi-signature and instead institute on-chain governance, and offered assistance with the transition.  “Due to the severity of the recent events, the future of the Wonderland story and how it unfolds will be remembered as a turning point in the history of crypto,” Haridy wrote. “In my opinion, it is up to us all in the crypto community to do our part and make sure that it is remembered as a moment where we all stood together to ease the pains of the thousands of everyday people who are hurt by this situation and to find a viable solution that puts them back in control of their own future.”  The notion of self-regulation for DeFi has some real-world precedent as well, according to Casey Hewitt, the founder of Hewitt Law. Standardizing any self-enforcement principles could prove difficult, however.  “If the goal is autonomy and self-regulation, there needs to be some accepted standards (even if it involves some level of anonymity) that everyone follows,” she said via Twitter.  Established financial entities, such as the CME Group, can do it, Hewitt said; so too should a sector of the crypto economy touching over $200 billion in assets.  “If DeFi wants to prove it can self-regulate, it needs to really do it,” she said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/02/14/sec-enforcement-against-wonderland-could-mean-trouble-for-defi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e697d4885897b3dee6f5db553cf797167021e46f-6210x4003.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421846,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwSQX,1644868495,What is a Distributed Ledger?,"Ledgers, the foundation of accounting, are as ancient as writing and money.  Their medium has been clay, wooden tally sticks (that were a fire hazard), stone, papyrus and paper. Once computers became normalized in the 1980s and '90s, paper records were digitized, often by manual data entry.     These early digital ledgers mimicked the cataloguing and accounting of the paper-based world, and it could be said that digitization has been applied more to the logistics of paper documents rather than their creation. Paper-based institutions remain the backbone of our society: money, seals, written signatures, bills, certificates and the use of double-entry bookkeeping.  Computing power and breakthroughs in cryptography, along with the discovery and use of some new and interesting algorithms, have allowed the creation of distributed ledgers.  In its simplest form, a distributed ledger is a database held and updated independently by each participant (or node) in a large network. The distribution is unique: records are not communicated to various nodes by a central authority, but are instead independently constructed and held by every node. That is, every single node on the network processes every transaction, coming to its own conclusions and then voting on those conclusions to make certain the majority agree with the conclusions.  Once there is this consensus, the distributed ledger has been updated, and all nodes maintain their own identical copy of the ledger. This architecture allows for a new dexterity as a system of record that goes beyond being a simple database.  Distributed Ledgers are a dynamic form of media and have properties and capabilities that go far beyond static paper-based ledgers. The short version is they enable us to formalize and secure new kinds of relationships in the digital world.  The gist of these new kinds of relationships is that the cost of trust (heretofore provided by notaries, lawyers, banks, regulatory compliance officers, governments, etc…) is avoided by the architecture and qualities of distributed ledgers.  The invention of distributed ledgers represents a revolution in how information is gathered and communicated. It applies to both static data (a registry), and dynamic data (transactions). Distributed ledgers allow users to move beyond the simple custodianship of a database and divert energy to how we use, manipulate and extract value from databases — less about maintaining a database, more about managing a system of record.

Bitcoin Exchange Whale Ratio Surges Up As Price Declines As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC exchange whale ratio has risen to very high values recently. The &apos;exchange whale ratio&apos; is an indicator that measures the ratio between the sum of the top 10 transactions to exchanges and the total amount of Bitcoin moving into exchanges. In simpler terms, this metric tells us what part of the total exchange inflows the ten largest transactions make up for. Usually, these large transactions belong to the whales. So if the value of the indicator becomes high, we can tell that whales are sending large amounts to exchanges as they now make up for a bigger part of the total inflows. Such a trend can prove to be bearish for the price of Bitcoin as it may show that whale dumping is going on currently. On the other hand, if the ratio goes down, it means a healthier balance is returning the market as whales control a lesser part of the exchange transactions.

42394299,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbQNl,1644863579,Why You Should Curb Your Enthusiasm About the 'Crypto Bowl',"Don’t say we didn’t warn you.  To the surprise of absolutely no one, the ads of last night’s Super Bowl broadcast were dominated by the usual stuff – beer, cars, snacks, sports betting – but also, inevitably, crypto.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Coinbase, FTX, Crypto.com and eToro all brought crypto-related sales pitches to the big game, as did TurboTax, with an ad nodding to the nightmare of handling digital assets during tax season. Meta had a commercial, too, albeit a somewhat depressing one.  This glut of fintech advertising is being called the “Crypto Bowl.” Larry David and Lebron James were there. Matt Damon was not there, despite past appearances in crypto commercials.  Crypto enthusiasts rejoiced, predicting imminent mainstream adoption (this time, surely!). Everyone else cringed (including viewers old enough to remember the 2005 Super Bowl, when the “winner” of the ad competition was a boiler-room subprime mortgage lender that shut down two years later as the housing bubble burst).  Here’s my brief (subjective) ranking of the crypto- and fintech-adjacent ads from this year’s Super Bowl broadcast, from worst to best.  6. “Old Friends. New Fun” – Meta  In this, a profoundly evil advertisement, an old animatronic dog from a retro diner relives his glory days through the power of Meta’s VR platform.  We see the dog face years of neglect, treated as a prop, forgotten on the side of the road and ultimately put out to pasture. Just before he’s crushed by a trash compactor, he’s saved by a kind stranger who repurposes him for one of Meta’s VR demonstrations. A headset is strapped to his face, and he’s suddenly transported to a digital replica of the diner he lost so many years ago. He warmly embraces the illusion.  It’s the “Make America Great Again” of Super Bowl ads, except somehow even more cynical – a suggestion that better days aren’t coming in the real world. Mark Zuckerberg’s proposed virtual world lets us cling to those ghosts of the past, the losses and regrets we couldn’t quite handle here on Earth.  At least the other tech-related ads this year were somewhat forward thinking. Increasingly, Meta feels like a company whose best days are behind it.  5. “Flying Your Way” – eToro  This ad, for the digital brokerage eToro, felt like a nod to the meme-stock/online trading movement that blossomed in the wake of last year’s GameStop short squeeze. It’s very much about investing together – everyone else is on board, so why shouldn’t you be, too?  “To the moon?” asks one trader, lifting a new recruit into a shifting mass of online investors.  There were even cameos of a Shiba Inu, the mascot of the cryptocurrency dogecoin, and another one from the Bored Ape Yacht Club.  You could say it’s sort of irresponsible to promise these kinds of moonward gains to an audience that’s potentially just now making its first crypto investments.  Unfortunately for dogecoin holders, the ad didn’t do much for the price.  4. “Matchmaker” – TurboTax  Boring, safe. Even Jason Sudeikis couldn’t save this one.  3. “The Moment of Truth” – Crypto.com  Crypto.com already drew plenty of ire (and garnered a “South Park” jab) for its ads with Matt Damon, which portrayed blockchain tech as a historical development on par with the invention of the airplane, and breathlessly promised traders that “fortune favors the brave.”  Its Super Bowl ad, starring basketball star Lebron James, repurposes that same tagline for a more lighthearted take on the concept. In it, a digitally de-aged Lebron talks with his present-day self in a messy bedroom circa 2003. It’s meant to evoke that feeling of taking a big leap, diving into something new with the potential for world-historic consequences.  On one of the bedroom walls, there’s a poster of Mars – the same shot from the end of the Matt Damon commercial.  It’s visually ambitious but conceptually simple. (It also flirts with the same recklessness as the eToro ad).  Fair play, Crypto.com.  2. Coinbase QR Code  This ad – just a QR code changing colors while bouncing around on a black screen, with a final splash screen reading “Coinbase,” was apparently so popular it crashed the exchange’s website.  It took Coinbase’s mobile platform to No. 2 on the App Store, and was hailed by Adweek as the year’s best Super Bowl ad.  “Coinbase spending $16,000,000 on a Super Bowl ad to direct people to [its] website and $0 to make sure that website doesn't crash 10 seconds after the ad starts is so very internet,” tweeted National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden.  It's certainly the most inventive of this year’s Super Bowl ads, but the trade-off was a lack of personality. At least it’s honest about what it’s selling – probably more than you can say for the Crypto.com ads.  1. “Don’t Miss Out” – FTX  The basic concept behind this ad is that Larry David, of “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” is a notorious curmudgeon – the poster child of curmudgeonliness, a curmudgeon’s curmudgeon. Here, he plays a naysayer throughout history, shunning each “next big thing” in its early days.  The invention of the wheel? “I don’t think so.” The beginnings of American democracy and the signing of the Declaration of Independence? “No king?”  The reaction to this ad, so far, has been overwhelmingly negative.  “Larry David in a crypto ad is a pretty succinct answer to ‘Is it ever possible to have enough money?’” wrote the comedian Patrtick Monahan. The Los Angeles Times ran an opinion piece with the title, “Et Tu, Larry?” – a nod to the endless river of celebrities joining the crypto parade. A Washington Post editor suggested the ad was part of a high-concept bit, wherein the next season of “Curb Your Enthusiasm” would deal with the backlash that comes with promoting crypto.  Whatever. Imagine, for a second, you didn’t know this ad was about crypto. The reality is that it’s pretty clever! I’d take it over that regressive, pessimistic Meta ad any day.  Bonus points to FTX for going to such lengths to conceal the actual product.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | DOGE | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | SHIB,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/02/14/why-you-should-curb-your-enthusiasm-about-the-crypto-bowl,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a4fbddecb824adf9c211bd85613db6b9417ba12c-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396037,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0ZrY,1644857953,Why Investors Have Been Slow to Trust Security Tokens,"Security tokens, seemingly poised for a comeback several months ago, have not been accepted by the wider investment community as quickly as some might have hoped.  Blockchain concepts such as digital wallets and smart contracts are not easily understood among traditional investors and regulators. Also, there has been a lack of trust regarding the quality of offerings on security token platforms.  Security tokens represent ownership shares in a company that does business using blockchain technology.  U.S. regulators have already provided a framework that would allow private companies to bypass traditional initial public offerings (IPO) and use blockchain technology to digitize the capital-raising process. Companies such as tZERO, Securitize, and Texture Capital, for instance, facilitate the trading of tokenized securities, catering to a sophisticated investor base.  But educating the public about security tokens, and being transparent about offerings, has taken more time than expected.  ""The security token space has been slower to adopt [by investors] than previously thought,"" Scott Harrigan, CEO of Securitize Markets, said during an interview with CoinDesk. The company launched its digital marketplace last year.  There is the potential for widespread adoption. Goldman Sachs has noted the efficiencies provided by security tokens for issuing digital debt. State Street wrote that ""all financial markets will have to digitize their processes and tokenize their assets to remain relevant"" in a December article.  “Investors are judging unique offerings based on the expected return on investment,” said Dave Hendricks, CEO of Vertalo, an Austin, Texas-based startup that helps issue and manage digital securities. But company ""founders decided that issuing a security token would attract a class of investors that were more interested in how the security was formatted rather than the underlying quality of the offering.”  Unlocking private capital  Some issuers and investors are showing growing interest in the security token space.  A report last month by Arca Labs showed that 71% of 100 financial service professionals surveyed in July were interested in investing in digital asset securities, and they believed that most securities would be digitized and settled on a blockchain in the next five to 10 years.  A majority of investors, especially individuals, have been locked out of participating in early-stage deals despite the flood of new capital in private markets versus public markets. Most secondary market transactions are handled by private equity funds with long holding periods.  Theoretically, tokenizing securities could make it easier for retail investors to access and trade private offerings.  Gaining the trust of family offices, wealth managers and other accredited investors hasn't come easy.  Marketplaces need to grow demand and expand quickly, according to Richard Johnson, CEO of Texture Capital. ""There's been some educational requirements for investors, and some weariness. There needs to be good deals,"" Johnson said during an interview with CoinDesk.  Blockchain-based alternative trading systems (ATS) provide greater transparency, increased speed and lower transaction costs, according to industry heads. The goal of security tokens is to make illiquid assets liquid, which requires a large pool of buyers and sellers that can easily trade on a digital exchange.  Gaining the trust of all stakeholders  The security token industry has been advocating for greater adoption through various events. ""Momentum is picking up,"" Harrigan said during a Jan. 27 digital asset security event hosted by Arca Labs. ""We're starting to see more trust in the system, which is key to liquidity.""  ""We recently launched two index funds with S&P, and we're seeing larger institutions take advantage of that. The biggest appeal is holding assets in digital wallets, which opens up the investor base,"" Harrigan said.  Experts on the panel also noted that regulators are more engaged in the security token industry despite onerous registration and compliance hurdles. Alternative trading systems have existed for securities for decades, Alex Vlastakis, president at tZERO ATS, said during the panel.  ""What's new and exciting is the innovation around trading and clearing of securities"" with blockchain technology, Vlastakis said.  But not everyone is convinced. ""It has become unclear as to what purpose or what efficiencies security tokens would offer to the global securities marketplace,"" New York City law firm PKA Law stated in a February 2020 letter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on behalf of a client.  ""It seems likely that the introduction and use of 'Security Tokens' will create undue burden on market participants, exchanges, custodians, clearing firms, retail and institutional investors,"" PKA Law stated.  Improving the security clearing process  Experts say regulators have not fully embraced the blockchain.  For example, despite recent improvements to the ATS settlement process, some digital security custodians are still required to maintain traditional book entries despite having an automated transparent record of ownership recorded on the blockchain.  Regulatory updates have allowed an ATS to ""directly convey settlement instructions to custodians on behalf of customers, which is a critical step in moving digital asset securities to a more mainstream securities trading process,"" Sean Bowden, CEO of Symbridge Capital, said during the panel. The company plans to launch a digital asset exchange later this year and is talking to potential issuers.  ""As the industry evolves, we look forward to ultimately getting on-chain settlement,"" Bowden said.  The compliance process can be cumbersome. It took 18 months for Texture Capital to receive regulatory approval versus the traditional five- to 12-month period for U.S. broker dealers.  Firms competing for a spot in the emerging arena are focused on attracting large-sized quality offerings in real estate, mining, sports leagues, and businesses who want to tokenize employee ownership.  ""We're building a new market structure from scratch, but we need to reach critical mass to boost liquidity,"" Richard Johnson, CEO of Texture Capital said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Damanick Dantes,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/14/why-investors-have-been-slow-to-trust-security-tokens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5308fe83e5f9e138da8125cd4237f8c3e1c781ea-2940x1960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42417120,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcS6fYj,1644855557,Canada Crypto Tax Guide 2022,"For Canadian citizens who cashed out any of their crypto assets over 2021, the time to start preparing for crypto taxes is fast approaching. Tax returns can be filed as early as Feb. 28 all the way up to the filing deadline of April 30.  While the filing process is generally quite straightforward for things like traditional employment, it gets much trickier when cryptocurrencies are involved – and yes, you are required to pay taxes on crypto in Canada.  The Senate reviewed crypto tax information in 2014 and recommended Canada’s leading body for taxes, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) issue guidance on how this new form of currency should be treated in the country.  This piece is part of CoinDesk’s Tax Week.  When do Canada citizens have to pay crypto taxes?  Under the guidance produced by the CRA, taxable events occur upon the disposition of any cryptocurrency. Disposition is the CRA’s term for “giving, selling or transferring” something, which in this case is a crypto asset. In general, common crypto dispositions that would be considered as taxable events include:  Paying for goods and services using cryptocurrency.  Selling crypto assets  Trading one cryptocurrency for another (including swaps, exchanges and peer-to-peer trades)  Cashing out cryptocurrencies into fiat currency  Gifting crypto assets to friends, family or work colleagues  This definition only views crypto transactions as taxable events, and there are no tax requirements for simply holding crypto. In short, the Income Tax Act holds that any bartered transactions, like the disposition of cryptocurrencies, will have income tax implications.  Read More: Avoid Crypto Tax Headaches: What You Need to Know if You Bought or Sold Crypto in 2021  The CRA treats cryptocurrency as a commodity under the Income Tax Act. Under this definition, crypto transactions can be treated as either business income or capital gain, depending on the type of transaction.  Business Income  Taxable business income is crypto income earned as part of a business operation. Determining whether income is business income is determined on a case-to-case basis. However, some common signs of business income include:  Promoting a product or service  Commercial activities that are done in a “viable way”  Intent to make a profit, irrespective of whether you’ll likely to do so in the near future or not.  Acting like a business, such as preparing a business plan and acquiring inventory.  Although business activities can be seen as regularly occurring, sometimes a single transaction can constitute business income. Because it's a case-by-case basis, the CRA will typically look at the “adventure or concern in the nature of the trade.” While this sounds complex in practice, it can actually be more straightforward. In determining whether you are acting as a cryptocurrency business, the CRA has provided further guidance on specific transactions and some common examples of crypto businesses including:  Running a cryptocurrency exchange  Crypto mining operations  Capital gains  If the disposition of a cryptocurrency does not constitute business income and it sells for more than the purchase price, then the CRA considers the taxpayer to have realized a capital gain. Capital gains are considered income for your tax year, but only half of realized capital gains are subject to the capital gains tax (“taxable capital gains”).  How much crypto tax do you pay in Canada?  Capital gains  Your capital gains taxes are determined by what is called the inclusion rate (IR), which is made up of taxable capital gains and allowable capital losses. IR has changed on multiple occasions but is currently at 50% of your total IR (taxable capital gains - allowable capital losses).  Business Income  Generally, different provinces in Canada will have different rates for income tax. Lower rates are typically reserved for income eligible for the federal small business deduction. While provinces can typically set whatever the maximum business limit is for this income, most use the federal business limit as a guide. Any business income above the business limit is required to pay the higher rate. The rate table is as follows:  Further Reading from CoinDesk's Tax Week  The Automatic Tax Man Cometh  Crypto won’t save you from taxes, but it may eventually make them easier to pay, says futurist Dan Jeffries.

DARMA (Digital Asset Risk Management Advisors) is making $100 million worth of its filecoin (FIL) holdings available to be loaned out, removing the need for users to buy the token to participate in the network, and allowing more storage providers to earn returns through the system’s proof-of-stake mechanism.  Turning the potential yield of filecoin into a swap – a contract where two parties typically exchange fixed and variable asset-backed cash flows for a set period of time – is being accomplished through the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), DARMA said in a press release on Monday. The CFTC is the agency that regulates derivatives markets in the U.S.  Managing data storage on the internet – a service currently offered by large firms like Amazon – but doing it in a decentralized manner, is a cornerstone of so-called Web 3, the next generation of interconnecting blockchain apps and services.  Filecoin storage providers, who hold files for the network and retrieve them when necessary, provide their spare hardware and meet electricity costs, but also have to acquire filecoin (FIL currently trades around $20 a token), an additional cost that presents an obstacle to many, according to DARMA Managing Partner Andrew Keys.  “People are used to bitcoin mining, where electricity, real estate and the hardware are needed,” said Keys in an interview. “It’s not the same hardware in the case of filecoin, but another huge hurdle that I don’t think people modeled for was the acquisition of the actual filecoin.”  Unlike a lot of crypto lending, which requires 80%-120% of the notional amount as collateral, DARMA’s swap requires only enough collateral to cover the risk of slashing, the penalty proof-of-stake participants can incur if they go offline or behave unpredictably.  The duration of the filecoin swaps range between 1.5 and 2.5 years. “Based on the current conditions on the Filecoin network, storage providers typically earn about 60%-80% on their pledged filecoin, contingent upon the amount of block rewards each storage provider respectively wins,” DARMA Product Manager Hyunsu Jung said in an email.  Jung said the use fee that storage providers are charged is a FIL-based rate that takes a share of the storage provider’s FIL rewards generated over the duration of the swap.  As well as removing the capital expenditure hurdle, another driver is diversifying the network away from China, where around 65% of Filecoin storage providers are concentrated, DARMA CEO James Slazas said.  “From a macro perspective, we want to get this out of China over the next 12 months,” said Slazas in an interview. “Most enterprises are going to have certain types of restrictions about data being held in China. So now we have a nice way to have it deployed in different jurisdictions, like the U.S., Europe and Australia.”  UPDATE (Feb. 14, 13:07 UTC): Changes DARMA to allcaps throughout.",POSITIVE,FIL,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIL | SPONSORED,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/02/14/darma-capital-unveils-cftc-regulated-filecoin-swap-product,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fa54177b1422784d721f3ad33ed2ea9038162071-690x444.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Under the leadership of Animoca’s Richard Robinson, the program will fund up to $500,000 per guild. Among priorities for acceptance will be projects with a focus on sustainability and those that support and give back to player/scholar communities.  “Guilds can help transform education, skill development, agriculture, R&D and almost any industry where access to tools and assets historically prevented anyone with time to innovate, up-skill and thus earn a living,” said Manav Gupta, founder of Brinc.  The Guild Accelerator Program comes as the play-to-earn (P2E) industry has boomed over the last year – Axie Infinity leading the way with more than $2 billion in trading volume just in the third quarter of 2021.  Crypto-related gaming guilds offer users the necessary funding and tools needed to play blockchain-based games, as some have significant barriers to entry, such as high starting fees. In return for providing the necessary funds or tools, the guild takes a cut of the earnings made from playing the P2E game.

The firm determines whether ransomware strains are affiliated with Russia based on three criteria: Whether they avoid attacking former Soviet countries, markers such as language and location and whether they are related to Russia-based cybercrime organization Evil Corp., Chainalysis said on Monday.  Ransomware attacks have grown in the past year, according to a joint report of U.S., U.K. and Australian cybersecurity authorities. North American addresses are the biggest targets, according to another Chainalysis report. The U.S. government is pushing for measures to combat this type of attack, in which hackers hold a firm’s data hostage.  In 2019-2021, between 29% and 48% of all crypto going to addresses belonging to businesses in Moscow City, the Russian capital’s financial center, came from “illicit and risky” addresses, said the research report.  The recipients included Suex, an over-the-counter exchange that has been sanctioned by the U.S. government; Eggchange, whose co-founder was reportedly arrested by Russian authorities in November; and peer-to-peer exchange Bitzlato.  These firms are linked to money laundering of the illegally obtained funds, Chainalysis said.  Some instances of firms receiving low proportions of illicitly obtained crypto can be attributed to their lack of awareness, rather than criminal activity, the report said.  Of all the crypto going to Moscow City, funds coming from scams at $313 million and darknet markets at $296 million made up the majority of illicit crypto in that time period. Ransomware came third at $38 million.

13400888,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=227516,1644839400,ETH Technical Analysis: Buyers’ Weakness And Risk Of Falling To $1780,"The trading week on the ETH market was spent in an attempt by byers to take control of the $3000 mark. Buyers were able to break this mark and test the global trend line, which was lost in mid-January 2022. However, the weekly candle closed not in favour of buyers. By lowering the ETH price below the weekly opening price, sellers formed a pin up and a false breakdown of $3000. If buyers fail to take control of $3000 this week and the price closes below this mark again, the end of February 2022 could be quite deplorable for investors. In this case, the Ethereum price will fall to the range of $2400 and this will be only the first target. The final target of sellers is around $1780. For such a sharp fall of the ETH price, it is also necessary for the BTC price to break the $42,000 mark. In this case, the entire cryptocurrency market will actively continue its fall wave. Technical Analysis Of ETH On The Daily Timeframe https://www.tradingview.com/x/jvnMpWZy/ Analyzing the movement of the ETH price on the daily timeframe, we see that there is still a chance to continue the growth of ETH.

The Nasdaq-listed firm's debut in the most expensive commercial airtime slot on the U.S. advertising calendar prompted ""more traffic than ... ever encountered,"" Chief Product Officer Surojit Chatterjee said in a tweet.  Coinbase had to ""throttle traffic for a few minutes,"" Chatterjee tweeted at 8:17 p.m. ET. According to Downdetector, users had been experiencing problems accessing the exchange since 7:20 p.m. The exchange announced on its main Twitter account that it was back up and running at 8:23 p.m.  With viewership in the U.S. consistently around the 100 million mark over the last decade or so, commercial airtime during the National Football League's annual championship showpiece is among the most sought after in the world. The price of a 30-second Super Bowl ad slot on NBC was reportedly around $6.5 million – up around $1 million from last year – with some slots costing as much as $7 million.

42396024,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0Zfk,1644831590,Indian Crypto Exchanges Met With Finance Ministry Officials to Seek Tax Reconsideration,"Representatives of India’s cryptocurrency industry met with senior policymakers at the Finance Ministry in a bid to make officials reconsider some aspects of the new crypto taxation policy.  The meeting was the first interaction between the crypto industry and policymakers since Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the crypto taxation policies during the national budget speech on Feb. 1.  Economic Times first reported that the meeting was held on Friday. However, CoinDesk learnt from multiple sources that a meeting was held on Thursday. Also, on Monday representatives from at least one major exchange held an unofficial consultation with a senior finance ministry official, according to a person who was present at the meeting.  TDS could discourage smaller traders  The senior leadership of the crypto exchanges sought a review of the 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) on all crypto transactions, saying it was not feasible and difficult to comply with. CoinDesk has learnt that Finance Ministry officials are assessing the concerns and their legitimacy.  Exchanges are also framing a formal and detailed proposal with the help of an industry body, the Blockchain and Crypto Assets Council (BACC), and the big four auditing firms, led by EY. BACC, which is a part of the Internet and Mobile Association of India, has been leading consultations with the government on behalf of crypto exchanges and the industry.  The framework is being created to convince the government to exclude the 1% TDS clause from the finance bill, said people familiar with the work. “The Finance Ministry is open to talks and has asked for a formal proposal,” said a person familiar with the matter.  On Feb. 5, the crypto industry was in a huddle and held a meeting to discuss the TDS issue. The takeaway was that TDS could discourage small traders and potentially move them towards informal peer-to-peer (P2P) trading and decentralized exchanges.  However, industry experts and tax officials are divided on whether the government would reconsider removing the TDS or whether removing it is the best move forward.  Industry views and expert opinions  “The government has introduced a removal of difficulties clause and this enables the department to be able to change the law,” said Anoush Bhasin, founder of New Delhi-based cryptocurrency tax advisory Quagmire Consulting.  “So, we will have to wait for parliamentary proceedings and discussions to see whether the government will reconsider. If not, the trading industry will be severely impacted. An alternate mechanism to collect transactional data must be explored with marketplaces/exchanges. The 1% TDS provision poses practical difficulties in implementation and an onerous compliance burden. It could severely dent investing and trading activity in India,” Bhasin said.  Gaurav Mehta, a crypto tax expert and founder of Catax, a one-stop-shop for crypto taxes, blockchain auditing and forensics, does not believe the government would reconsider saying that “in the interest of price discovery, risk management and compliance as primary responsibilities of exchanges, the exchanges should not have a problem with the 1% TDS.”  “Uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrency regulations, limited knowledge of the capital market and a desire to maximize profits drove exchanges to innovate unnecessarily, to the point where complexity became too much to handle – taking positions against the market, custodian, settlement, evangelism, airdrops and initial coin offerings (ICO), and incentivizing trades with rewards. Obviously, TDS is complicated for them. For exchanges engaged in standard exchange operations, TDS should be a cakewalk,” Mehta said.  Sidharth Sogani, founder and CEO of cryptocurrency research organization Crebaco, believes the government can come up with an alternate method, saying, “The potential of the crypto space is being ignored. If we make compliance simple, the industry will grow faster. Third-party auditors can be appointed to provide reports rather than applying TDS for the sake of transaction tracking.”  Capital gains tax also on the agenda  Apart from the 1% TDS, exchanges are also concerned about the 30% tax on all crypto investment gains. However, the reduction of the tax rate is a secondary priority.  “The crypto industry also hopes for a reduction in the 30% flat tax rate on gains but is unlikely to press on this at the moment,” Sogani said.  The budget included new rules for the crypto ecosystem, such as a 30% tax on any income from the transfer of virtual digital assets and a 1% TDS on all crypto transactions. The new rules will become law when the finance bill is passed by the parliament, which is expected in a few weeks.  Sumit Gupta, co-chairman of BACC and the CoinDCX exchange’s CEO, had earlier tweeted that the “30 [percent] tax will discourage traders.” Several industry leaders had echoed the same sentiment.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Amitoj Singh,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/02/14/indian-crypto-exchanges-met-with-finance-ministry-officials-to-seek-tax-reconsideration,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/039f52b233ef27178686d2317edb3a3d2dd87665-1405x1012.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Currently, users need to call a banker to place an order for crypto over the phone. The plan, Gupta said, is to make it online and self-service.  DBS has yet to announce additional details about the platform, such as if you’d be able to transfer digital assets purchased on it to other providers or wallets.  The Monetary Authority of Singapore has a licensing regime in place for retail exchanges. In December, Binance withdrew its licensing application and recently shut down its local binance.sg exchange.  Recently, the bank expanded the trading hours of the desk to be 24/7 to match the tempo of crypto. Prior, trading was done on bankers’ hours within Singapore’s time zone.  In a recent interview with CoinDesk, Lionel Lim, CEO of DBS Digital Exchange (DDEx), said DBS Digital Exchange’s full-year trading volume for 2021 was about $819 million (S$1.1 billion).  In the last quarter of 2021, trading volume was approximately $595.5 million (S$800 million), which was over double the trading volume for the three prior quarters.  Last year DBS issued a $15 million bond as a security token offering. STOs are regulated token offerings.  This class of offering hasn’t attracted much attention in Asia. Some experts have said the nature of STOs needing to stay within the borders of a securities clearinghouse is antithetical to the idea of crypto and thus won’t attract much interest from investors.

In comparison, fees today are 71.15% lower than the $52.46 average transaction fee that was last seen on January 10, 2022.

42421211,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXgrfR,1644823800,Israel's Securities Regulatory Chief Lays Out Crypto Plans,"The Israel Securities Authority (ISA) has big plans to regulate the country’s fintech space. As a first step, it is hosting its first ever fintech hackathon next month.  The ISA is looking to attract blockchain-based solutions that can improve the infrastructure supporting the securities and sovereign debt markets in Israel with the hackathon. The securities regulator has partnered with the Ministry of Finance in Israel, Start-Up Nation Central, as well as tech providers like VMware, Digital Asset and Algorand to host the onsite hackathon, which will be held on March 24, 2022, in Tel Aviv.  The hackathon will be led by privacy tech provider and World Economic Forum (WEF) Technology Pioneer QEDIT, which plans to help teams discover and bridge gaps in privacy compliance and regulation.  According to Anat Guetta, chairwoman of the ISA, the blockchain hackathon is part of a larger initiative for the ISA to not only collaborate with professionals in fintech innovation, but to also start gathering the expertise and influence needed to regulate the fintech and the crypto sector more broadly.  An economist and banker with decades of experience, Guetta has been serving as the chairwoman of the ISA since 2018. In 2020, Guetta said distributed ledger technology had the potential to transform Israel’s capital markets.  CoinDesk spoke to Guetta about the ISA’s plans for the hackathon and Israel’s long-term goals for regulating crypto.  The following has been edited for brevity and clarity.  CoinDesk: Why is Israel’s securities regulator hosting a blockchain hackathon?  Guetta: The ISA is now the leading fintech regulator in Israel, and the hackathon is part of the activities that it is leading as part of this role. The main motivation behind the hackathon is to facilitate the transfer of technology from a developmental environment to applications in a large-scale live environment that may bring to light various technological, business and regulatory issues. We hope to integrate novel technologies to Israel’s existing capital market infrastructures, and we believe the ISA’s steps will encourage other regulators in the country to promote projects involving new technologies.  We also expect the hackathon to serve as a catalyst for effective and high-standard collaboration between various actors in Israel's financial system. The hackathon will serve as a meeting site between the ISA and developers, technology firms and academic scholars. Bringing together the teams of these technology providers will create an opportunity for regulators and for other stakeholders to gain in-depth technical knowledge on global fintech developments. This is also the first fintech focused hackathon to be organized by Israeli regulators.  How does this hackathon fit into the ISA’s broader plans for crypto?  I must say that first of all, regulators are lagging behind when it comes to technology. It was always a fact, and it will be so also in the future. We are not so advanced, and we do not have the risk appetite that the industry has. We are here to balance and to monitor and to supervise.  We see crypto and blockchain as two separate phenomena. We see great potential for blockchain technology. Crypto activity is a separate issue that we are examining and considering how it should be supervised in a holistic way in Israel, as it should be in other areas in the world.  What blockchain-based fintech solutions will be the focus of this hackathon?  The first thing that the hackathon will examine is the issuance of securities and government bonds. Different asset types like stocks and bonds have different issuance requirements, sometimes involving several different parties like brokers. It means that the originators of an asset do not usually have a direct channel to investors and buyers, which complicates the processes. This experiment will educate us about other innovative ways to lead issuances of securities and government using blockchain in the future.  How does Israel’s approach to regulating blockchain and crypto compare to other jurisdictions?  The ISA is part of the IOSCO organization, which is the association for securities regulators worldwide. It’s part of the main committees that are active on blockchain and crypto. My regulatory approach is that because Israel is not the biggest country in the world, because we are a very small and smart country, we don't have to reinvent the wheel each time that regulatory needs come up. I believe that the right way for Israel is what we call the passporting attitude. It means that we would accept an entity that has a current license from regulators that are accepted by the ISA. I believe that we will have to learn the state-of-the-art regulations by watching regulatory updates worldwide and learn how to adopt the rules for Israel.  Looking beyond the hackathon, what should be the most urgent focus of a regulator in establishing oversight in the blockchain space?  At the end of the day, our aim is to get the power that we need in order to supervise and to build this new market for new participants because we understand that regulation, as in many other fields, is the license to do business. Blockchain producers, creators or marketers need regulation in order to have a clear idea of what is permissible.  We see the statistics. We see that most blockchain companies are not operating in Israel. They prefer to operate outside of Israel. I think that we’re losing them as an economy and as a country. We need very precise and clear laws in order to bring them back here. And we should create the conditions to let them work from Israel in a legitimate and acceptable way. So, our higher mission is to get the right powers in order to enable this.  How do you see the ISA regulating the crypto space?  I believe that crypto needs a holistic regulatory framework in Israel that will cover the industry end to end. We’re looking very closely at what the U.S. and its Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are doing.  I think that the nuances that regulators are trying to find between different types of crypto assets is wrong. I think that we should take crypto as a whole and implement regulatory supervision on it because, otherwise, technology is smarter than us. Regulators did not notice when the initial coin offering craze started in early 2018. Today we have very sophisticated issuances of crypto that are not exactly securities like stablecoins or utility coins. We should take a very wide definition of crypto and have authorities supervise it. I think that this is the right direction.  The nuances between securities and crypto are not very clear. We cannot always define them using our legal tools. I think that, in the end, securities regulators should adopt crypto as a security regardless of its format without going into details. The public is exposed, and we cannot protect investors and consumers in the way that they should be protected from the crypto phenomenon. Opportunities are also going away because we cannot define what is eligible and what is not eligible in our market. So, this is the endgame that we should aspire to.  I read that in January 2021, a company called Kirobo tried to prove that they were issuing a utility coin but the ISA ruled it was a security. Is this what you mean?  Yes, we have some cases where a token was defined as a security by the ISA, but if we have 14,000 different crypto tokens today and the ability to print a new one almost seamlessly, we cannot use the resources that were provided to us to protect investors to analyze each case. This is why my opinion is that we should have very wide responsibility for this new industry end to end and this is the only way to close the gaps that we have between the point that we should stand on and protect our public and the point that we are standing on today.  When you said crypto assets should broadly be considered as securities, did you also mean cryptocurrencies like bitcoin as well?  I don't want to go into specific examples, but I think that bitcoin is not different from any other. When bitcoin was created in 2009, it was a very small phenomenon before it became what it is today. Many other crypto assets that are active today are on the same path. So I don't differentiate between bitcoin but, as I mentioned, bitcoin is not defined as a security today and to go there, the ISA will have to get the rights and legislation to give us the right powers that we need that we currently do not have.  We have to wake up and understand that there is no real difference between crypto and securities and we have to unify the definitions in order to protect consumers and investors, and to make this industry legitimate.

42375295,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw79fJ,1644802200,"Young, Crypto-Savvy Voters May Hold Key to South Korea's Next Election","The Takeaway:  Young crypto investors have become a major force in South Korea's March 9 election.  Real policy details will come post-election once a new administration comes to power.  Taxes, investor protections, the travel rule and policies to bring crypto companies back lo South Korea are likely to be in the cards.  All of South Korea’s presidential candidates have announced crypto-friendly stances in a bid to win over young voters ahead of the election next month.  Real estate is the biggest issue on voters’ minds in South Korea now as young people under the age of 24 earn salaries of around KRW 2.6 million (US$2,176) a month, face expensive Seoul rent and have no hope of buying an apartment. Many of them have turned to stocks and crypto.  According to Edward Hong, head of platform at crypto venture capital firm Hashed, there are more than 5 million individual crypto accounts across the country’s top three crypto exchanges. Hong estimates that about 10% of this year’s voters are crypto investors.  Around 91% of South Koreans own a smartphone. Internet penetration is 96.5%. Gaming is popular, and the average person has some level of trading experience. Combining all that forms a population that is highly receptive to crypto assets, and a swath of Gen Z voters have emerged as a serious electoral force in the country.  Political calculations  Candidates have offered little so far in terms of concrete policies about regulation crypto, in contrast to their detailed pledges on fixing housing issues. They have, however, made statements about their support for the industry.  “They are incentivized to say more crypto-friendly statements or not say anything negative, as that might lose them votes from the young generation,” said Steve Lee, an investor at BlockTower Capital, a hedge fund focused on crypto asset and blockchain technology.  In September, the current administration proposed a 20% tax on crypto gains made in a one-year period over KRW 2.5 million (US$2,122), but had to walk that back after backlash from crypto investors.  While there have been drafts for blockchain-specific legislation that would require investor protection and disclosure rules, no law has been passed, and the lack of clarity is deterring potential institutional investors.  “There has been progress in 2021, but regulatory guidance on crypto investment still needs more clarity,” Lee said.  Jin Kang, head of legal at Hashed, said the lack of regulation is a “calculated risk” to make sure that the ruling party can attract voters with its proposal of a regulatory framework.  There are 14 crypto-related bills circulating at the moment. ""Something has to happen after the presidential election,"" Harold Kim, former director of Korea Blockchain Association, said.  Bringing companies back  Candidates have pledged to bring crypto companies back to South Korea. There is now a de facto ban on initial coin offerings (ICOs) as a result of a notice posted on the Financial Services Commission’s website in 2017, though it never made it into legislation or regulation.  After the notice, crypto-related companies moved to Singapore or other jurisdictions so that they could conduct business without regulatory uncertainty.  Kang said that rescinding the notice won't be enough to attract companies to move back. He said only a “more comprehensive package” will get people to bring their crypto businesses back to South Korea, which might include tax incentives coupled with educational or job-related incentives and benefits for employing locals.  So far, more comprehensive policy packages have been issued only at the local government level. The city of Busan, for instance, has been designated as a regulation-free blockchain special zone, which allows projects to test technology and services.  Consumer protection  Recent headlines in South Korea have highlighted the issue of insufficient protection for crypto investors.  After gaming company WeMade announced that it would launch play-to-earn games, its stock price soared.  “This shows the level of NFT (non-fungible tokens) hype among retail investors, but also how listed companies or brand names drive hype,” Lee said.  Last month, after news spread that WeMade was selling off its WEMIX tokens in tranches, its token price fell sharply as the company faced allegations that it was enriching itself on the back of retail investors.  In its white paper, WeMade stated that 74% of its tokens would be used to support the growth of its ecosystem. It has said that its intention was for the token to become an in-game currency for at least 100 games.  At the present time, there is no clear standard for disclosure or any standard on how clear a company should be about its holdings. Chang Hyun-guk, WeMade’s CEO, has pledged to make transactions more transparent and compensate investors.  Many of South Korea’s largest entertainment and gaming companies have indicated their interest in the crypto sector, saying at annual and shareholder meetings that they will pursue NFTs or play-to-earn games.  Some industry observers, meanwhile, have argued against blaming WeMade; instead, they cite the regulatory vacuum.  Exchanges  The consolidation of exchanges due to new rules means that users can use a government-issued currency at only four exchanges in South Korea. Upbit, with its partnership with app-based lender K bank, is the largest crypto exchange in South Korea with about an 80% market share.  Still, there are uncertainties over listing criteria.  “I don’t think there are many tokens that could meet stock market standards,” Kim said. “We’d like to see a set of rules.”  Some new bills require that token issuers be in contact with exchanges. For example, with ether, an exchange would have to seek approval from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and his team. Some criteria also require that a financial history be provided for tokens as it is for stocks.  There is also uncertainty over the travel rule and how prices will be registered, information verified and infrastructure put in place.  Moreover, some exchanges are suffering as difficulties in moving funds overseas means they have a presence only in South Korea.  The candidates and their positions  Yoon Seok-youl  People Power Party candidate Yoon Seok-youl made an appearance at the 2022 Virtual Assets Conference last month, where he spoke of the need to overhaul unreasonable regulations. Yoon has promised a shift to using negative regulation to regulate the virtual asset market.  Yoon argues that infrastructure should be ready before a crypto tax is announced. Last month, he pledged to make the no-tax threshold for crypto gains the same as that for stocks (KRW 50,000 million or US$42,450). He said he will allow initial exchange offerings and plans to set up a digital industry promotion agency. The government will be able to confiscate profits obtained through market manipulation, he said.  Lee Jae-myung  Democratic Party candidate Lee Jae-myung has touted the possibility of bringing initial coin offerings back. He visited Upbit's offices last month. Lee has released NFTs and said he would accept crypto for his campaign donations.  He has set up a gaming and metaverse special task force and has spoken about making the country a crypto hub, pledging to create a national crypto asset and distribute that to the public. He is calling that proper procedures be put in place before the government rolls out a crypto tax.  Ahn Cheol-soo  People Power Party candidate Ahn Cheol-soo has gained votes following scandals involving the top two candidates. He has pledged to make South Korea into a ""sci-tech"" nation and said that he wanted his party to run on blockchain technology.  He has said that listing standards should be clearer for tokens and that investors should be able to access information and analysis about what they are buying.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Lavender Au,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/02/14/young-crypto-savvy-voters-may-hold-key-to-south-koreas-next-election,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a8fc8a356f2791ef600b277aecfac2523064fb3c-1500x936.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
