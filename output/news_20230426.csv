42393667,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj29EH,1682552829,Crypto and Regulators Are Speaking the Same Language When It Comes to Financial Transparency,"One of the issues that happens whenever an industry grows is it becomes difficult to tell if everyone is speaking the same language. Nowhere is this clearer than in the conversations between builders of decentralized finance (DeFi) and financial regulators. Can linguistic consensus be found at Consensus? It seems unlikely.  For the most part, financial watchdogs in the U.S. (and the international bodies that are essentially offshoots of the U.S. Treasury Department) have said crypto clearly fits into the existing regulatory framework. Crypto’s governing rules have already been written, supposedly.  This article is excerpted from The Node newsletter, which will send two editions daily during the Consensus 2023 conference running down the biggest news from the event. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here. It's not too late to get IRL or virtual tickets for Consensus 2023 here.  And so, you have situations like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chairman, Gary Gensler, telling crypto operators to “come in and register” with the agency and FinCEN advocating for stricter know your customer/anti-money laundering (KYC/AML) requirements across crypto.  Crypto, with exceptions, has largely promoted itself as a square peg that cannot fit in the round hole of the so-called Howey Test (the guidance the SEC uses to determine whether something is a security, which essentially probes whether ""the investing public is anticipating profits based on the efforts of others”).  This is one of the sticking points for Chamber of Digital Commerce founder and CEO Perianne Boring, who spoke Wednesday at Consensus’ Mainstage. In crypto the terms “community” and “collaboration” are thrown around a lot – terms that mean one thing to insiders, and another to regulators.  “What does it mean to work collaboratively?” Boring asked. To the SEC the answer doesn’t matter; when a group of people organize to build a potentially valuable system, it “triggers our laws,” she added. At least on stage, Boring didn’t seem confident this different definition cold be explained away – not by lobbying or commenting on proposed guidance, she said.  Still, not all is lost for crypto in the U.S. In a panel discussion between Uniswap’s legal chief Salman Banaei, dYdX’s marketing lead Nathan Cha, Maple Finance co-founder Sidney Powell and The Defiant founder Cami Russo, the decentralized finance advocates were adamant that regulators will come around to the power and purpose of DeFi.  Regulators and DeFi advocates are on the same page. They both want increased transparency within the finance system (and that doesn’t necessarily mean that non-custodial, permissionless apps will all eventually add KYC procedures). Instead, what regulators try to do with the written word, DeFi can do through code.  You’ve heard the argument before. DeFi provides real-time auditability, an immutable record of transactions and the ability to easily track users. As designed, on-lookers may not immediately know the identity of DeFi users, but given time and resources that information can be determined – precisely the job of financial regulators.  See also: Kristin Smith Sees 'Bright' Outlook for U.S. Crypto Policy  This isn’t just marketing speak, Banaei came prepared with statistics. According to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), seizure rates of illicit funds within the traditional financial system are around 0.1% – meaning regulators have recaptured about one-thousandth of the funds known to have been used for criminal activity. The seizure rate for crypto: 27%, according to Banaei.  This isn’t to say crypto is a pigpen of financial crime either. At least according to analytics firm Chainalysis, only a miniscule amount of crypto transactions can be tied to criminal actions. What all this means is that if the government is concerned about terrorist financing or money-laundering, it should likely opt for crypto's unequaled transparency.

42393673,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj29j3,1682551592,Technology Is Blocking Mass Adoption of Web3,"AUSTIN, Texas — More brands and creators are entering the Web3 space but are facing a bottleneck until the user experience in the ecosystem is improved to onboard new members and push forward mass adoption, a panel including Web3 executives, a consultant and an agent discussed at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2023 conference in here.  “Every click that you need to take in the (onboarding) process, you're going to lose 50% of people,” said Julie Garneau, head of Web3 at brewing giant Anheuser-Busch, during “The Opportunities and Roadblocks of Mass Adoption” panel discussion. “I need the tech people to help me fix that on-ramp because it's so critical.”  Andy Sack, co-CEO of Forum3, a Web3 loyalty startup to advise retailers such as the Starbucks Odyssey project, sees the concept of protecting a wallet in order to have an experience as “an alien one for consumers.”  Read full coverage of Consensus 2023 here.  Meanwhile, a flurry of crypto-native and Web2 brands have been making efforts to bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3 audiences to push mass adoption. Chris Jacquemin, head of strategy at talent agency WME, which has signed more than 50 Web3 creators, said that when discovering various communities through social media, the “vocal minority within Web3 is literally the foundation of actually establishing credibility.”  The brands need to “​​figure out how you can balance the partnership and relationship between somebody that has no presence currently in this space but needs to build it because this will be here forever,” Jacquemin said.  Ariel Wengroff, vice president of communications at offline private-key storage company Ledger, however, thinks Web3 is the first time brands can have a direct maintainable relationship with the interested audiences and direct accountability to that relationship.  “Any creator or brand should be absolutely terrified by the social communities that they have right now because you have no actual control over it,” Wengroff said. “You don't actually know who they are. Any brand that says they have a community is lying to you.”  Looking ahead, Wengroff sees having ""enterprise security"" and ""governance"" as essential for a brand such as an additional proof of record for a product the consumer purchases regularly.  ""I think the power will be when other brands learn from what everyone else is doing, Starbucks included,"" Anheuser-Busch's Garneau said.  Another huge influence on onboarding to Web3 will be artificial intelligence, with both positive and negative impacts, said the panelists. ""AI is going to drive Web3 usage,"" Sack said. ""AI is going to create the need for the blockchain.""  ""AI and the speed with which it's moving, and the deep fakes and really the destruction of reality in the metaverse, or the ability to manipulate it, is going to require a system of trust,"" he added. ""And that will also require a system of cryptography to verify one's identity.""  The panelists were unanimous in worrying about how AI will onboard users, however. ""I don't expect that transition to be smooth,"" said Sack.

Dawn Harflinger, CEO of Lili’uokalani Trust, and others who invest in the crypto sector offered a tone of optimism despite recent market destruction, which Harflinger equated with the famous bloodbath of the “Red Wedding” episode of the HBO series “Game of Thrones.”  Harflinger said she’s actually looking forward to running into the “burning buildings” of this market, specifically saying she’s excited to get additional exposure to secondaries, participating directly in the funding rounds of growth stage blockchain companies.  Read full coverage of Consensus 2023 here.  She shared a panel at Consensus with Matt Halstead, the director of real estate and digital assets for Texas Teachers, and Dan Tapiero, chief investment officer at 10T Holdings.  Halstead contended that digital assets are “an investment that has the potential to be integral to the future of technology,” emphasizing the broader impact of the innovations. Halstead also acknowledged both the volatility of digital assets along with their willingness to accept it, indicating that they have very little opinion on market timing.  “It’s not clear how the industry is going to evolve, but we think the future’s bright,” Halstead said. The overriding theme is the opportunity in digital assets is multi-faceted, he said, and that valuations – while in decline – are worth the gaining of exposure.  This message was echoed by others on the panel.  The digital asset ecosystem is broader and deeper than in the past, Tapiero said, and assets have lower correlations to bitcoin itself. Despite asserting that “I’m not hearing anyone say that bitcoin is going to zero,” he said the existence of uncorrelated digital assets gives institutions the opportunity to expand beyond bitcoin, such as investing in discounted altcoins and tokens.  Increased adoption of digital assets from traditional finance led to valuations being pushed to excessive levels, said Tapiero. Asset valuations from 10x to 12x revenue, were replaced by valuations of 50x to 100x. The resulting declines led to crypto winter being felt by a wider number of participants.  As valuations have come back in line, Tapiero argued the timing is promising for big returns.  “If you know what you like, and what kind of portfolio you want to build, it's the best time for crypto investing,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | ZRX,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/26/tradfi-sees-opportunity-in-crypto-despite-red-wedding-burning-buildings,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/68809048610abc75be1a1b8fb7ab4431ce6b1779-3734x2100.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last year turned down the asset manager's request to convert the biggest bitcoin (BTC) trust into an ETF. The conversion could help Grayscale eliminate the infamous discount for the product; GBTC's market value is far below the actual value of all the bitcoin it holds.  Grayscale (which, like CoinDesk, is owned by Digital Currency Group) then sued the SEC over that decision, and its CEO, Sonnenshein, said Wednesday that he anticipates a decision in that case by the end of September.  ""We're eagerly anticipating a decision from the courts between now and then,"" he said.  Read full coverage of Consensus 2023 here.  The SEC has defended its rejection, saying its reasons for denying Grayscale's applications were consistent with its earlier decisions to deny every other spot bitcoin ETF application it had received.  Sonnenshein didn't say if he expects the ruling to be in Grayscale's favor. However, he expects to ""work expeditiously"" with the SEC to ensure that the conversion happens and list the product on the NYSE Arca exchange, if the decision goes in favor of the asset manager.  In terms of future of the crypto industry, Sonnenshein said the price of the digital assets won't be the best indicator of the health of the ecosystem. The underlying technologies, developments and use cases that are drawing investors today are going to look very different further down the road.

Countless internet think pieces have eulogized the metaverse and the larger concept of Web3, once championed by tech powerhouses such as Meta Platforms and Nvidia following the onset of the crypto market downturn. But Web3 could make a comeback, Mathieu said, if the people building it focus on creating a community around decentralization and other values important to young people who will ultimately populate these experiences.  “Decentralization of the internet for the people [and] by the people … is one of the key elements that needs to be part of the reinvention of the reboot of Web3, "" said Mathieu. “It’s going to come back because it fundamentally is not just a technology but corresponds to the values of the new generation.”  Read full coverage of Consensus 2023 here.  The values of Web3 are generally understood to be the promotion of decentralization, transparency and self-sovereignty. But those values won’t be the only driver of the mass adoption of the internet’s next iteration, according to Mathieu: The movement must also adopt a business model that responds to the needs of the next generation of internet users. Citing the landmark release of the iPod, which put 1,000 songs in your pocket, Mathieu alluded to Web3 still needing its killer app.  “The iPod was not a huge technological innovation, but it was a user interface [and] business model innovation, and it was also a communication innovation,” said Mathieu. “It gave birth the way we live with mobile and web technology today.

He said a world in which the blockchain enables investors to buy treasuries with additional functionality would have “great appeal” to mainstream users, which is why the New York-based asset manager is preparing to launch a crypto wallet on the Apple App Store in the second quarter this year.  Read full coverage of Consensus 2023 here.  The wallet will enable trading of tokenized real-world assets such as gold or real estate, said Steinberg. And he sees this as a huge advantage to holders of illiquid assets: “We thought through tokenization and blockchain-enabled finance that you could add functionality … When you put tokenized, physically backed gold with peer-to-peer exchange and payments, gold now becomes currency, like it was hundreds of years ago.”  Steinberg said that such a wallet doesn’t exist in the market yet. “Tokenized securities don't yet have a venue to launch on,” Steinberg said. “Anyone with a brokerage account could buy an ETF without paperwork and that's pretty democratized but nothing's more democratized than your smartphone. You can reach virtually the whole world,” he said.  “So for Wisdom Tree, it's just building on a new channel, building on our strength in bringing exposures to the market in a safe and compliant way and we'd like to try to do the same thing for crypto as well.”  WisdomTree’s embrace of crypto as the next evolution of ETFs is controversial, Reynolds said during the onstage interview.

But nothing will have the effect of actually launching” the wallet, he said, “which is really just the beginning of the journey.”  WisdomTree, which announced this month that it cracked the $90 billion asset-under-management mark, currently has nine crypto funds approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that invest in traditional assets such as U.S. Treasuries.

Just as how big corporations were initially uncomfortable with cloud computing but it's now normalized for institutions as cautious as the Central Intelligence Agency, real-world assets will be eventually tokenized on private blockchains, then permissioned chains, and finally public chains, said Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo on stage.  ""Firms are getting more comfortable with it,"" Domingo said. ""Private blockchains are okay, but it only solves part of the problem.""  Read full coverage of Consensus 2023 here.  Tokenization is the process of putting ownership of tangible assets, such as precious metals, on the blockchain, and offers the convenience of buying and selling these assets around the clock because the transactions do not involve traditional brokers.  Christine Moy, head of Digital Assets at Apollo Global Management, added that tokenization ""changes how value is transferred"" and is only possible now because the technological gap has been closed.  ""The concept of tokenization isn’t new, but it’s taken on new legs in the past,"" Morgan Krupetsky, Avalanche Labs' Director of Business Development for Institutions, added, saying that institutions and investors have gotten comfortable with the technology as we've come a long way since 2017 when the idea first emerged on the market.  Rising interest rates have also added a sense of urgency in getting this technology ready for the mainstream because, Krupetsky said, because rising rates have compressed token prices and created a demand for new things on chain. We are at the point where the customer just has to say ""yes please"" to tokenization, she added.  If tokenization gets the positive market reception that the panelists on stage hoped it would, it would represent the next chapter in crypto, according to Securitize's Domingo.

42393669,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj2999,1682541821,Art Blocks Co-Founder Erick Calderon Uses Free Market Ideals to Defend NFT Royalties,"AUSTIN, Texas — Erick Calderon, the co-founder of Art Blocks, tried to turn down the heat on the battle around non-fungible token (NFT) creator royalties at CoinDesk’s Consensus Festival. He made his own opinion on the matter clear, however: According to Calderon, royalties “let the creator keep creating.”  Art Blocks is an NFT collection and organization focused on generative art – artwork that is generated autonomously according to rules set by its creator. (In the context of NFTs, the term usually refers to art that’s generated by computer programs that are made to live on blockchains.) Recently, Art Blocks debuted an NFT marketplace that bakes in creator royalties as a default feature.  Royalties – money paid out to an NFT’s creator each time it is sold – have long been a matter of debate among creators and collectors. Some artists view built-in royalties as a key value-add – if not the key value-add – of NFTs, and they've been dismayed when NFT marketplaces and collectors have taken steps that erode the practice of rewarding royalties as a norm.  Read full coverage of Consensus 2023 here.  In his address at Consensus, Calderon made a case for creator royalties while remarking that the fundamental value-add of NFTs – royalties aside – remains the same.  “No matter what the stock market cycles do, no matter what [failed crypto exchange] FTX does and no matter what happens with our regulation in our government, the value proposition of being able to prove ownership of a digital asset cannot and will not change,” said Calderon.  Referring to buzzy concepts such as international marketplaces and creator royalties that are unlocked by NFTs, Calderon said that “all of those are value-add on top of the basic premise of being able to prove ownership of a digital asset.”  On the subject of royalties, however, Caderon said they are valuable for creators as well as for the wider NFT ecosystem – including the collectors and investors who might typically avoid purchasing assets that require artists to get a cut each time they are sold.  There are obvious reasons why an artist might prefer to sell NFTs that pay out a royalty.  “The concept of being able to not slog through continuously releasing artwork in order to make a living – but being able to be more thoughtful on your releases and create something that can generate in perpetuity, additional income,” is appealing to creators, said Calderon.  As for NFT buyers that want to avoid royalties that can cut into their profits, “there are opportunities that can be missed here if we just look at royalties as a transfer tax,” said Calderon.  Calderon delivered a defense of creative royalties – and the incentives that they encourage on the part of artists – that wouldn’t be out of place in an Ayn Rand novel. According to Calderon, NFTs incentivize artists to think more deeply about their artwork and engage continuously in the NFT community. With the prospect of a bigger, prolonged payday, Calderon thinks artists will create better, more valuable artwork – with the benefits (and profits) trickling down to speculators.  Royalties aside, argued Calderon, the Web3 art marketplace will always be fundamentally more artist-friendly.  “A lot of things in the traditional art world happened behind closed doors,” he said. “Here, everything is happening in the open. We are all building in the open. We are all innovating in the open. We are all transacting in the open. We know exactly who's paying royalties and who's not paying royalties.”  Anti-royalty marketplaces and NFT collectors still have a place in this ecosystem, he continued. When the debate around NFT royalties boiled over earlier this year, “it was a lot of people shaming people for operating within a way that this ecosystem perfectly permits them to operate in.”  Calderon admitted his free-market logic in defense of creator royalties also applies to those who seek to dismantle them: “It's like gun laws. You have these rights, and people get very aggressive about their ability to retain that right. When you're talking to a decentralized ecosystem, actually, you have every right to participate in it however you wish.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/04/26/art-blocks-co-founder-erick-calderon-uses-free-market-ideals-to-defend-nft-royalties,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/38b530fef2b4fa4777a1ff06ca2b962429a74140-4030x2267.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

12119973,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=528764,1682537101,This Highly Profitable Bitcoin Cross Has Just Formed Again,"On-chain data shows that a Bitcoin cross that has proved quite profitable has once again formed for the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Realized Price Of Short-Term Holders Overtakes Long-Term Holders As an analyst in a CryptoQuant post explained, the realized price of the 1 to 3 months holders has just exceeded that of the 6 to 12 months investors. The “realized price” here refers to a metric derived from the “realized cap,” which is a capitalization model for Bitcoin that assumes a coin’s true value is the price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain rather than the current BTC price as the usual market cap says. The realized price is obtained when the realized cap is divided by the total number of coins in circulation. Since the realized cap accounted for the prices at which the investors acquired their coins (their “cost basis”), the realized price represents the average acquisition price in the market. This means that whenever the Bitcoin price dips below this metric, the average cryptocurrency investor holds assets at a loss. Similarly, a break above implies a transition towards profits for the average investor. In the context of the current discussion, the realized price of three specific segments of the market is relevant; the holders who bought between 1 month and 3 months ago, 3 months and 6 months ago, and 6 months and 12 months ago. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: NVT Golden Cross Enters Overbought Zone The first two of these are parts of the “short-term holder” (STH) cohort, while the third one is part of the “long-term holder” (LTH) group. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin realized price specifically for these segments of the market: Looks like two of these metrics have come together in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As shown in the above graph, an interesting pattern formed during the leadup to the 2021 bull run. First, the realized price of the 1-month to 3 months cohort exceeded that of the 6- 12 months group. Following this crossover, BTC saw some sharp uptrend, but it didn’t last long. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market At Decision Point: aSOPR Retests Crucial Level Then, as this price increase winded down, the 3- 6 months segment also crossed above this LTH cohort. These crossovers implied that fresh purchases were happening in the market as the rally built up. Since the prices were rising during this leadup, the STHs had to buy at higher and higher prices, which is why their realized price went up and eventually became higher than the LTHs’. After these crossovers were completed, the BTC bull run ramped up. Recently, the first of these crossovers seem to be forming again, as the realized price of the 1-month 3 months group is now equal to that of the 6 months to 12 months band. While it’s uncertain if the second crossover will also go and take shape now, Bitcoin could observe at least some bullish momentum from this initial cross alone (assuming that it’s not just a fake-out), just like it did back in 2020. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $29,800, up 1% in the last week.

Speaking at CoinDesk’s Consensus Festival on Wednesday, Johnson said the future of the industry “will be regulated,” and that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC) were a “distraction” from crypto’s real innovation, blockchain technology.  “Bitcoin is the greatest distraction from the greatest disruption [coming to the financial system], and that’s blockchain,” Johnson said.  Read full coverage of Consensus 2023 here.  “I can tell you, if bitcoin ever became so big that it became a threat to the U.S. dollar as the reserve currency, the U.S. would limit … the use of bitcoin. Currencies are very important for governments … to manage their economies,” said Johnson. “They will not cede their currency to this concept of a global currency.”  Johnson added that it’s better for companies to engage directly with regulators as they develop new products. Johnson added that Franklin Templeton, which manages $1.5 trillion in assets, has been in close contact with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as it developed its newly launched blockchain-based mutual fund.

Johnson said that regulators, both in the U.S. and outside of it, are nervous about passing regulations that could have unintended consequences.  “This is a complicated space, and the regulators are trying to be thoughtful,” Johnson said.  Regulatory uncertainty aside, Johnson is still bullish on the potential for crypto and blockchain technology to disrupt the financial industry.

In the long term, decentralized exchanges (DEX) will strengthen the backbone of future financial systems, panelists said during the ""DeFi vs. CeFi: A Distinction With a Difference"" panel at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2023 conference here.  The main roadblock to mass adoption of crypto by average users has been the complexity of the technology. This is why centralized exchanges such as Coinbase (COIN) have been able to provide on-ramps for many jumping into digital assets.  ""If my grandparents wanted to buy bitcoin, are they going to download MetaMask, figure out how to hold their own keys and all that? Probably not,"" said Nathan Cha, marketing lead at crypto derivative exchange dYdX during the panel.  Read more: DeFi vs. CeFi in Crypto  However, the lack of transparency in a CeFi exchange is what eventually led to failures such as the spectacular collapse of FTX in November. When a customer uses a centralized exchange the money goes into a wallet but everything behind that is controlled by an entity that isn't transparent and is not using blockchain infrastructure, said Sidney Powell, CEO of crypto lender Maple Finance, using two failed companies, BlockFi and Celsius Network, as an example.  ""Effectively, it was a private ledger,"" Powell said. However, that's not the case for decentralized finance (DeFi) because there is more transparency in how the money is being stored and moved. ""If you contrast that with DeFi lending, whether it's Aave, Compound or Maple, you can see the movement of funds at all times and it's always controlled using Solidity and using smart contracts,"" he added.  ""The core difference [between CeFi and DeFi] is ... self-custody. But more than that, from a technology perspective it's the use of smart contracts and a blockchain to actually operate the business,"" Powell said.  However, he added, that doesn't mean there will be mass adoption of the DeFi ecosystem anytime soon because CeFi will still likely be the main avenue, in the short term, for traditional finance customers and older users to adopt the digital assets.  Read more: Will DeFi Emerge From Crypto Winter Stronger?  Also, the current regulatory environment in the financial market integrates well with the CeFi model, said panelist Salman Banaei, head of policy at Uniswap Labs. ""CeFi has an advantage in the sense that their business model, with clear control persons, is reflected in kind of the regulatory infrastructure that we currently have,"" he said. He noted that this makes it an easier transition for CeFi to fit into securities or commodities or banking laws.  DeFi, on the other hand, has a disadvantage on that front because it relies on an open-source protocol that reduces ""control surface area"" from a regulations perspective, Banaei added.  However, this will change in the longer term, he said. Over time the role of CeFi won't change drastically from what it is right now, whereas DeFi will eventually become the main infrastructure for the future of the financial system, Banaei said.  Down the line, ""DeFi kind of becomes the backbone for a new economy, while CeFi kind of plays – continues to play – that kind of on-ramp role into this much richer DeFi-based environment,"" Banaei added.

12118763,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=528765,1682532052,Bitcoin Bulls On Edge As Pivotal Level Sets Stage For Potential Price Surge Or Slump,"Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has experienced a volatile market over the past few days, with its price fluctuating between highs and lows. However, BTC has recently bounced back from a major trend line at $27,000 and is currently trading at $29,600, representing a profit of over 8% in the last 24 hours. This latest surge in BTC’s price comes after the collapse of a major US bank, First Republic Bank. The news of this collapse may have contributed to the uptick in BTC’s price, as investors seek alternative investment options after the bank’s failure. Related Reading: XRP Trades Near Crucial Support Of $0.46, Will This Level Hold? Another Bank Failure Tied To BTC’s Price Surge Theto the trader and analyst, who goes by the pseudonym “CJ,” has identified what they believe to be the current parameters for the market. According to CJ, if Bitcoin’s price closes above 30k and the US dollar index (DXY) breaks to a range of 97-100, the market will likely reach the 33k liquidity level. However, if Bitcoin’s price rejects this level and closes below 29250, it could be a bearish re-test. It is worth noting that Bitcoin has recently bounced from a key pivotal support level of $27,000, which is good news for bulls in the short term. However, the market is still uncertain whether Bitcoin will break above the $30,000 resistance again or experience another slump. On the other hand, the recent bank failure, as described by Nick Gerli, CEO and Founder of Reventure Consulting, has highlighted the potential risks associated with traditional banking and finance. This has led investors to question the stability of the traditional financial system and seek alternative options. On the contrary to this situation, Bitcoin has been on the rise since the beginning of 2023, and some analysts believe that the current economic climate could be a contributing factor. The recent contraction in the money supply in the US has led to a decrease in available capital, which could lead investors to seek alternative investment options. With its decentralized nature and limited supply, Bitcoin has become an attractive option for investors looking to diversify their portfolios. Furthermore, Bitcoin’s recent price uptick can be attributed to several factors, including increased institutional adoption and growing mainstream acceptance. However, the current economic climate has undoubtedly played a role in Bitcoin’s recent surge in value. As the economic outlook remains uncertain, many investors turn to Bitcoin as a safe haven asset. The cryptocurrency has been touted as a hedge against inflation and economic instability, and its recent price uptick could reflect these beliefs. Bitcoin Highs Already Made For The Year? The Puell Multiple, a metric used by cryptocurrency traders and analysts to gauge the value of Bitcoin, has recently made a perfect retest of its uptrend, according to CryptoCon, a trader and analyst of the crypto market. This retest suggests that the upward trend of Bitcoin remains intact and could potentially lead to much higher valuations in the future. The Puell Multiple is calculated by dividing the daily issuance value of Bitcoin by the 365-day moving average of the daily issuance value. It is a useful metric for understanding the current state of Bitcoin’s mining ecosystem and can provide insights into the potential future direction of Bitcoin’s price. With the Puell Multiple’s recent retests of its uptrend, CryptoCon suggests that the upward momentum of Bitcoin remains strong and could lead to even higher valuations in the future. This is welcome news for bulls eagerly anticipating a continued rise in Bitcoin’s price. Related Reading: Cardano ADA Trades Below The $0.41 Mark, Will It Break The Barriers?

The investment giant said in a press release, during Consensus 2023, that it continues to see operational efficiencies through use of blockchain-integrated systems, including increased security and faster transaction processing.  Read full coverage of Consensus 2023 here.  The fund is the first U.S. registered mutual fund to use a public blockchain to process transactions and record share ownership, the investment firm claimed in the press release. On Monday, the Stellar Network announced the fund is available on its network. Stellar has a $2.5 billion market capitalization and Polygon's is over $9.5 billion.  “Extending the reach of the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund to Polygon enables the fund to be further compatible with the rest of the digital ecosystem, specifically through an Ethereum-based blockchain,” said Roger Bayston, head of digital assets at Franklin Templeton, in the press release.  Franklin Templeton, which has been a proponent of blockchain technology in the past, continues to see operational efficiencies through use of a blockchain-integrated system, according to the statement. The firm announced in September that it will offer digital asset strategies to wealth managers.  The fund, which aims to provide steady income for its holders, invests at least 99.5% of its assets in government securities, cash and repurchase agreements. Money market funds are mutual funds that invest in highly liquid and short-term investments that intend to offer investors with low-risk options.  In the wake of recent market volatility and banking crisis, investors have been pouring into money market funds to hedge their investment risks. With more institutional investors pushing further into digital assets, traditional finance (TradFi) players are using this opportunity to merge both worlds by offering such funds via blockchain technology. Most recently, Ondo Finance said it is offering a stablecoin alternative that will be pegged to the U.S. dollar and backed by money-market funds that trade on traditional exchanges.  One share of Franklin Templeton’s fund is represented by one ""BENJI"" token, where the holders are able to gain exposure to the fund through digital wallets via the Benji Investments app, according to the press release.  ""Tokenized assets are going to positively rewire the global financial system, and Franklin Templeton is at the forefront of this movement,” said Colin Butler, global head of institutional capital at Polygon Labs, in the press release.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | MATIC | SPONSORED,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/04/26/a-14t-financial-giant-expands-its-money-market-fund-on-polygon,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e7344bb7352ed5ce5e3234988f9717c9c6e57d4d-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Reddit, Starbucks, Nike, Adidas, PepsiCo and hundreds of brands have tapped into Web3 and non-fungible tokens (NFT) ecosystem in the last year as a way to deepen their relationship with their audiences and customers. But with a flurry of U.S. regulatory enforcement activity, the status quo of regulatory unclarity has been “our biggest challenge to date” to roll out Web 3 strategies, Brady said on stage at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2023 conference in Austin, Texas.  “We have to structure ourselves to comply with the current regulations, and unfortunately they are very limited or antiquated based on the 1940s written securities laws,” Brady said. “Until we can figure out a lot of that, we're still limited in what we're doing.”  Read full coverage of Consensus 2023 here.  Amanda Cassatt, CEO at Serotonin, agreed, adding that “regulatory clarity brings growth.” Cassatt pointed out that the long-awaited Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) legislation passed by the European Parliament last week, makes a distinction between centralized and decentralized projects in the space.  “I think we're gonna see some of the best, highest-quality regulation that comes out make that distinction, which is super cool and going to push people in the direction of true decentralized blockchain,” Cassatt said.  Brands are making efforts to shift the language from crypto-native terms to more general terminology to reach a broader array of customers, said Shiva Rajaraman, chief business officer at NFT platform OpenSea. He said that it's critical for brands to find their own language and easy crutches to onboard new audiences.  ""Maybe it's about the intersection between a brand's language, what they want their community to say and do,"" Rajaraman said. ""Start with that, and then try to map Web 3 principles or artifacts onto that.""  “It’s about weaving a kind of poetry between the DNA of what your brand is, what makes it successful in Web 2, understanding what the substrate of Web 3 is, and how those things can intertwine to create something new,” Serotonin’s Cassatt said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/04/26/regulation-clarity-will-bring-more-consumer-web3-users-on-broad-pepsicos-executive-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ec4becf8e84fcb6d1dde811b4099bc1b00e78066-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The model will probably go to a community-wide vote in late May, Head Chef Jared Grey told CoinDesk. The changes, if approved, will include overhauling the protocol’s “Chef” contracts to improve the code that underpins its activities following a multimillion-dollar hack earlier this month.  “V3 helps us make tokenomics more efficient [and] vice versa. With v3’s improved capital efficiency and improved and sustainable tokenomics, we will scale growth across our more than 30 supported networks,” Grey said.  The changes will also increase decentralization, improving the protocol’s security, Grey told CoinDesk.  The exchange is attempting to beef up security in the wake of the exploit, which drained $3.3 million from the platform’s wallets earlier this month. The hack exploited a vulnerability in SushiSwap's Route Processor 2, a smart contract component that aims to execute trades more efficiently while boosting liquidity provisions. Some funds have since been recovered.  SushiSwap has patched the bug, and has stealthily introduced v3 of its router on some networks to support v3 adoption, Grey tweeted. The router will launch on more networks soon.  SushiSwap’s team also plans to roll out a series of changes to the protocol’s interface that aim to facilitate cross-chain swapping, according to Grey’s tweets.  The sushiswap (SUSHI) token is trading at $1.08, up 5.4% in the past day, CoinGecko data shows. The price has increased by roughly the same percentage over the past month.

However, according to recent reports, the asset may just be gearing for another rally. In the last 24 hours, another major United States bank was reported to be facing a financial run signaling insolvency issue or bankruptcy. Another Major Bank Collapse Could Impact Bitcoin Rally According to the latest update, First Republic Bank (FRC) is currently experiencing a financial run as the bank disclosed it lost nearly $100 billion in deposits amid last month’s banking crisis. The bank said it is currently unloading between $50 billion and $100 billion in debt instruments as part of its “strategic options” to resolve the massive capital outflow. However, the White House has expressed concern about a way to assist the bank out of insolvency, as reported by the Financial Times, which revealed that officials from the Biden Administration, the Federal Reserve, and the Treasury Department have consulted the bank’s top executives in the past few days. Related Reading: Notorious B.I.D. 2.0: Biggie-Sized Bidder Will Fuel Bitcoin Rally Again? Despite this, investors and traditional bankers seem to have begun panicking, searching for a safer haven or alternative for the store of value. Following the news, the First Republic shares plunged by more than 40% reaching an all-time low in Tuesday’s trading session. Particularly, FRC shares hit an all-time low of $8.10 as the markets closed on Tuesday. Interestingly, while that happened, Bitcoin prices began to experience a bullish movement. This bullish movement can be attributed to the panic of traditional bankers seeing BTC as a bold alternative as major banks continue to collapse. BTC Could Be Warming Up For Another Rally The last time a similar banking crisis occurred in the US in March this year, Bitcoin reacted positively to the news and tapped $30,000 for the first time in nine months. And according to Bitcoin’s latest price action, the asset seems to be affirming expected price action based on past price action exposure to the banking crisis news. In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin has recorded gains in its value, surging 7.5% with a market price of $29,817. Over $30 billion has been added to its market capitalization in the same period. Its trading volume has also surged indicating a buying pressure. According to on-chain data provider Santiment, Bitcoin’s social dominance has increased compared to other altcoins in the market. Santiment noted this “happens during market euphoria or (in this case) fear.” The data provider further noted, “Prices can rebound quickly.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Reclaims $29,800, Driven By These Factors Santiment is not the only one that anticipated Bitcoin’s rebound from its previous bearish price action. Popular crypto analyst Michael Van de Poppe stated: Bitcoin isn’t looking bad on the higher timeframes. Healthy correction, and as long as Bitcoin sustains above $25,300 it’s likely we’ll continue this rally towards $42,000. According to the analyst, as long as Bitcoin remains above $25,300, which it currently is as the asset trades above $29,000, Bitcoin will enjoy another rally to trade above $40,000.

42393684,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj2Lil,1682527170,Circle Unveils New Method for Moving USDC Between Blockchains,"Austin, Texas — USDC issuer Circle Internet Financial on Wednesday released a new method to move the major stablecoin between blockchains that it says is faster, safer and cheaper than the “bridges” that are widely used in decentralized finance.  Called the “Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol,” or CCTP, the technology will be used initially for USDC transfers between the Ethereum and Avalanche blockchains, with more chains coming in the second half of 2023. DeFi apps can integrate relevant smart contracts to make it easy for users to move their stablecoins.  The technology attempts to break down the barriers now fragmenting USDC’s $30 billion market cap across many different blockchains. Though Circle issues “native” USDC on many top networks, including Ethereum and Avalanche, those asset tranches were more or less partitioned; those who wanted to ""bridge"" the divide had to engage in complicated and sometimes expensive cross-chain transfers.  Read full coverage of Consensus 2023 here.  Circle’s new method seeks to replace bridges, which solved that problem by creating another asset, a derivative token called a wrapped asset. CCTP works by destroying USDC on the source chain and recreating it on the destination chain.  The process could pay the biggest dividends when it comes to asset swaps. It could be used to move cross-chain and cross-token transfers behind the scenes.  “With CCTP, developers can simplify the user experience and their users can trust that they are always transacting with a highly liquid, safe and fungible asset in native USDC. This milestone makes USDC a natively multi-chain digital dollar,” Joao Reginatto, vice president of product, said in a press release.  Wallet company MetaMask, bridge operator Wormhole and bridge aggregator LI.FI are among the infrastructure providers with CCTP coverage at launch.  Circle couldn't immediately be reached for comment.

Snapping its five-day losing streak, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) surged 8.7% to $29.77K as of shortly before 1:00 p.m. ET, eyeing the $30K resistance zone that the token has had a tough time fully breaking out of throughout much of April. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), the world's largest altcoin, also jumped 6.8% to $1.94K, and cardano ( ADA-USD ) +8.4% , polygon ( MATIC-USD ) +8.5% and solana ( SOL-USD ) +7.8% . The outsized upswings occurred less than a day after struggling regional lender First Republic ( FRC ) said it l ost more than $70B in deposits during the first quarter, bringing total deposits to $104.5B at March 31. It's now fighting to survive as the embattled bank seeks to convince other banks to buy $50B-$100B of its long-dated and mortgage securities in an effort to shore up its balance sheet. Keep in mind that cryptos rallied last month perhaps as market participants sought alternative assets like bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ) in the wake of three U.S. bank failures. Bitcoin has long been branded as a safe haven asset -- digital gold -- but it's still down some 60% from its November 2021 record high as many central banks across the globe hiked interest rates aggressively to squash persistently high inflation. Didar Bekbauov, founder and CEO of bitcoin group mining company Xive, said the banking jitters that emerged last month spurred a rally in bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), as the turmoil ""left investors quite skeptical of the traditional financial escape, thus leaving many to go all out on BTC."" He also predicted that BTC's upcoming halving event -- the mechanism whereby the reward for mining a new block on the blockchain is cut in half after every 210,000 blocks produced -- could reach $35K by the end of Q2, calling it ""a major fundamental."" Earlier this week, Piper Sandler analyst Geoff Kendrick contended that bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) price could reach $100K by the end of 2024, in part because the stresses in the banking sector help to ""re-establish BTC’s core use case as a decentralised, trustless and scarce digital asset."" Crypto's bullish price action pulled up crypto-exposed stocks. Among the biggest winners include MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) +9.6% , BIT Mining ( BTCM ) +15% , Marathon Digital ( MARA ) +15.9% , CleanSpark ( CLSK ) +15.4% and Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) +9.8% .

42393695,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj2MY3,1682526900,Seeing the Macro Forest for the Token Trees,"One thing I like about macro investing is the scope.  While financial analysts and their respective crypto degens counterparts are looking at balance sheets, earnings statements, Solidity code and social media sentiment, macro strategists get to think about the consequences of exogenous things.  Put another way, while the analysts examine the forest tree by tree, macro investors sit on a hill, surveying the whole valley and considering which parts of the forest will be nourished or threatened by rainfall, forest fires, changes in land use and other factors outside of the idiosyncrasies of the micro analysis.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Being macro in digital assets means considering historical environments in which cryptocurrencies have thrived as well as more challenging environments, such as 2022.  Last year, digital assets were clearly sensitive to the Federal Reserve’s efforts to tighten financial conditions. There are many ways to measure financial conditions, but to keep it simple we can simply use trends in nominal and real yields, U.S. dollar exchange rate baskets and corporate credit spreads. From these measures we can create a financial conditions indicator and see how it relates to the historical risk-adjusted performance of digital assets, as proxied by bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH).  To estimate trends in these financial-condition proxies we utilize a trend signal similar to the one used in the Bitcoin Trend indicator (BTI) released recently by CoinDesk Indices.  To represent nominal yields (“NomRates”), we use two-, five- and 30-year U.S. Treasury yields; we subtract the five-year breakeven inflation rate derived from TIPS to create a proxy for two-, five- and 30-year real yields (“RealRates”). U.S. dollar denominated baskets of advanced and emerging economy currencies are used alongside a broader basket as three proxies for the dollar (“FX_USD”). And option adjusted spreads (OAS) for high-yield corporate bonds rated BB and CCC are used alongside an investment-grade index to represent U.S. credit conditions (“Credit_OAS”).  Trend signals are generated from the data within these four macro indicator buckets, then averaged to result in a positive, neutral and negative score for the financial condition regime. Risk-adjusted return ratios (annualized return per unit of volatility) are calculated on BTC and ETH within each regime and compared to an unconditional buy-and-hold strategy (“BuyHold”) shown in the figure below.  From this preliminary macro regime analysis it’s clear that financial conditions matter when investing in digital assets. Keeping a pulse on market conditions, particularly real and nominal interest rates and credit conditions, can help to navigate the crypto cycle better by offering a better risk-adjusted return than a simple buy-and-HODL approach.  In summary, as investors in cryptocurrencies we’d all benefit from taking a broader macroeconomic and market perspective to not miss the forest for the trees.

42393691,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj2MIf,1682525120,Voyager Lawyers ‘Surprised’ Binance.US Canceled $1B Deal,"Voyager Digital was taken by surprise when Binance.US canceled a $1 billion deal to buy its assets on Tuesday. The exchange was still showing interest as recently as last week, Voyager's attorneys said in a New York courtroom on Wednesday.  Binance.US had made an offer for the bankrupt crypto lender in December but pulled out on Tuesday, citing an ""uncertain regulatory climate"" in the U.S.  “The debtors have been in constant contact and communication with Binance.US and as lately as this past Friday, Binance.US had expressed the desire to close the transaction as soon as possible,” Christine Okike of law firm Kirkland & Ellis, representing Voyager, told a bankruptcy court in the Southern District Court of New York, adding that “the debtors reserve all rights against Binance.US for breach"" of the deal.  Given the collapse of the Binance.US deal, likely recoveries for Voyager creditors are in the range of 40% to 65%, Okike said, depending on whether Voyager wins a parallel lawsuit involving bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, and how much recovery FTX offers its creditors.  Okike also said Voyager would attempt to give creditors back their holdings in original cryptocurrency, dismissing speculation it would instead seek to pay the cash equivalent.  “The debtors have every intention of making 'in kind' distributions subject to regulatory restrictions and our platform functionality,” Okike said, but warned that a shifting legal position from U.S. regulators could complicate Voyager's ability to do so.  “We're faced with a situation where the SEC [Securities and Exchange Commission] may not have taken a position or issued a formal order with respect to [Voyager’s token] VGX,” Okike said, “But they've made certain allegations that could make it untenable in certain situations for the debtors, for instance, to sell VGX into the market.”  The regulatory uncertainty that would require payments to be made in cash applied to tokens with a likely total value of $1.6 million within an overall estate of around $1 billion, Okike said.  Voyager filed for bankruptcy in July, and a deal by FTX to buy its assets fell through after FTX also collapsed in November. The Binance.US deal was held up in part by protestations from the SEC that the fine print of the deal offered exoneration for breaches of tax or securities law.

12116389,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=528650,1682524800,EOS Foundation Launches Upgrade As Crypto Market Rallies,"In an exciting update, the EOS Foundation recently launched a major upgrade with innovative developments and solutions to its network ecosystem. The upgrade coincided with a market recovery today that saw the price rally of Bitcoin and some altcoins alongside it. The theme of the upgrade had a positive ring to it, intending to deliver speed, scalability, and reliability to the EOS blockchain network. EOS Network Launches Antelope Leap V4.0.0 Upgrade The Antelope Leap v4.0.0 upgrade is an open-source software that enables anyone to operate a node on the EOS blockchain network seamlessly. For clarity, a node is a computer system that runs a blockchain consensus model by validating incoming user transactions and storing the data in a distributed network ledger. Node operators use these computer systems to validate network transactions while securing a blockchain network. They earn token rewards for their contributions to the validity and integrity of blockchain ecosystems. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Signals Fresh Increase But $29K Is The Key To More Gains That said, the EOS Antelope Leap v4.0.0 upgrade was launched to optimize node performance, making it easy for anyone to carry out node operations without hassle. Solutions the upgrade brings forward to node operators include multi-threading features to boost node performance, reduced node latency, faster block propagation, and more visibility and control. The Leap v4.0.0 upgrade is an important milestone and achievement for the EOS blockchain ecosystem. Node operators have been advised to upgrade their nodes to the newest Leap version for ease of use and compatibility with other network infrastructure. Will Price Respond The price of the EOS token has responded sluggishly despite the Leap v4.0.0 upgrade launch and recent market rally, which saw Bitcoin reclaim the $29,000 price region. At the time of writing, the third-generation blockchain token is seen trading at $1.07, according to Coinmarketcap data. This is only a slight increase from its 24-hour low of $1.02. While BTC gained over $1600 from its 24-hour price change, EOS is still yet to notably move compared to some altcoins, largely profiting from the BTC rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market At Decision Point: aSOPR Retests Crucial Level Bitcoin is on the move to test its $29,200 resistance. If it fails to break, a retracement could occur, negatively impacting the price of EOS and other cryptocurrencies traded in the markets. However, on the EOS monthly chart timeframe, the token is seen to be trading at base levels and halfway close to its all-time lows, which may indicate close to bottom levels for a reversal. There is room for upside movements of the token to profit from as current market sentiments are becoming positive due to BTC’s recent price move.

42393694,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj2MNn,1682524800,"As Crypto Grows, so Does CoinDesk’s Commitment to Keeping Pace","Proximity to information and access to new tools is one of the things that I value most about being at CoinDesk. Each day there’s cutting-edge access to news and early looks at tools that we as a firm are looking to bring to the marketplace.  The new Bitcoin Trend Indicator (BTI) from CoinDesk Indices is useful for investors, specifically those looking to employ systematic, non-discretionary strategies. Successful and timely identification of trends in price movements is paramount to any active investing strategy – and that’s something BTI appears to deliver.  While this new tool might not be so useful for investors engaging in a long-term, buy-and-hold strategy, for those with a tactical bent – a penchant for entering and exiting positions quickly – it’s got significant value. It should work well in tandem with watching seasonality, which is particularly important following the crypto winter markets endured for much of 2022.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  As a practitioner of technical analysis, I view visual identification as a tried-and-true method of identifying trends. You pull up a chart, observe the extent to which prices are moving and apply trend lines to provide a graphical outline of those trends. They can effectively be used to identify and project the direction of an asset’s price movement, with breaks below or extensions above being instances worth noting.  An application of this directional identification approach would likely identify bitcoin’s (BTC) uptrend since January, following a two-month period of relatively flat, range-bound trading.  Breaks of the trendline can be seen in early March and April 19, when BTC took a brief pause amid its massive 74% gain to start 2023.  Similar patterns appear for ether (ETH), given its 53% recent uptrend and trendline breaks occurring on the same dates.  Candidly, a degree of subjectivity exists when drawing trendlines. Where I draw my trendline may be completely different from where a colleague draws one. Methodology can vary as well. Where one may connect trend lines at an asset’s closing price, another may draw the trendline at its high or low price for the day.  This is not meant to call into question the practice itself, but to highlight potential variations in the analysis of identical data. From my vantage point, it’s no less subjective in nature than picking one valuation multiple over another when performing fundamental analysis.  Historical price data can be used to identify seasonality and trends as well. Past pricing data can be separated into buckets related to time, and used to identify patterns.  For example, pulling daily price data for BTC from 2014 shows that October has produced the highest average daily return in comparison to other months, a gain of 0.53% per day. The worst month has been September (a 0.16% average loss), with a stretch of consecutive average positive daily returns existing from February to August historically.  Not surprisingly, ETH has demonstrated similar behavior, although its stretch of consecutive positive months is narrower, with the longest one occurring from October to December.  Investors can also narrow the time period of evaluation to a more recent time frame to evaluate the extent to which performance may have shifted.  Of note in 2023 is the somewhat sporadic monthly returns, with underperformance in February and April, surrounded by outperformance in January and March. The lack of a discernible trend in instances like this highlights the need for objective, quantitative-based tools to evaluate trends. As crypto matures and the base of crypto investors widens, so, too, will the need for tools that strip the emotion out of allocation decisions. CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Trend Indicator can do that.  In a nutshell, the BTI identifies the “presence, direction and strength of momentum in the price of bitcoin.” It is calculated daily at 4 p.m. ET (20:00 UTC at this time of year), using prices from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX), our BTC benchmark.  The five BTI signals, (color coded for clarity from red to green) are significant downtrend, downtrend, neutral, uptrend and significant uptrend.  A look into its methodology shows that a series of moving average crossovers are utilized within four distinct crossover windows of varying lengths. Exponential weighting is used to fully capture the importance of more recent prices.  A backtest of the BTI shows it identified an uptrend in October 2020, before BTC jumped to $40,000 from $10,000. From a risk management vantage point, it also identified movement to “neutral” from “uptrend” in May and November 2021, before substantial drawdowns.  A missed signal can be seen in late March 2022, when the BTI signaled an uptrend before a 59% drop through June. It’s also worth noting, however, that while the uptrend was identified on March 28, the BTI identified a neutral signal on April 8 and a downtrend signal on April 10.  There is no Holy Grail indicator, so I expect other false signals. I find comfort seeing that the BTI has demonstrated an ability to quickly adapt to a changing landscape however.  I would encourage all who are reading this to give the BTI a look, particularly those who are looking to build systematic, non-discretionary strategies.  Give it a try, poke holes in it, completely ignore any bias that I may have towards it and see how it fits into your own investment process. Feel free to let us know how you feel as well, whether positively or negatively. Feedback can be the lifeblood of improved processes.  Our goal at CoinDesk is to constantly provide products and services that add value to your own.  – Glenn C. Williams Jr., CMT  Takeaways  From CoinDesk Deputy Editor-in-Chief Nick Baker, here’s some news worth reading:  GEMINI’S GAMBIT: Gemini, the Winklevoss twins’ crypto exchange, plans to open a derivatives platform outside the U.S. – initially offering bitcoin perpetual contracts. Gemini’s bigger rival, Coinbase, is also toying with the idea of setting up shop outside the U.S. It’s really no surprise at all that U.S.-based crypto businesses are thinking overseas thoughts as American regulators crack down hard on the industry. The question is whether folks in Washington really want to risk forcing crypto onto foreign turf. For all the anti-crypto talk from the likes of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), there’s plenty of support for aspects, at least, of the industry from conventional financial circles and other politicians.  MORE COINBASE: Coinbase isn’t just mulling whether to create an exchange outside the U.S. It is asking a court to compel its regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to finally decide on whether existing securities laws apply to digital assets. This appears to be a preemptive move by Coinbase to argue that the SEC hasn’t given enough guidance for U.S. crypto companies.  WAKING UP: A strange thing has been happening lately with bitcoin. Several large wallets with roots in the early days of this whole blockchain experience have begun waking up and are moving BTC around. Why these whales have awakened is far from clear, though there’s some speculation they’ve been cracked by nefarious actors. Yes, security still matters in crypto.  ETH’S HANGOVER: Ether (ETH) rallied strongly earlier this month after the Ethereum network was upgraded to allow staked ETH to be unstaked. But that rally, which arguably made ETH more appealing to investors by removing a major obstacle, has now basically disappeared.

The fundraising round, which closed in March, was led by crypto venture-capital firm Spartan Group and included participation from Robot Ventures, Maven 11, Alchemy Ventures, HashKey Capital, Circle Ventures and Superscrypt, among others.  Cata Labs is building Catalyst, a cross-chain bridge that aims to make it easier for blockchains to communicate with each other. At present, popular layer 1 blockchains such as Ethereum and Solana cannot easily transact with other blockchains, creating a spurt in bridging projects like the Jump Crypto-backed Wormhole and Andreessen Horowitz-backed LayerZero.  Read More: Crypto Protocol LayerZero Raises $120M at $3B Valuation  “It’s become stupidly easy to make new blockchains,” said Jim Chang, co-founder of Cata Labs. “There are ways where you can click a button and make a new blockchain. It doesn’t really make sense to have all these blockchains if they can’t talk to each other.”  Chang, who was previously a product manager at decentralized-finance protocol Aave, is working with Cata Labs co-founder Alexander Lindgren to launch Catalyst.  Catalyst is different from existing bridges in that it can come already integrated into blockchains that opt into its ecosystem, forgoing the laborious and manual integration process characteristic of bridges such as Wormhole.  Read More: Celestia Labs Raises $55M to Build Modular Blockchain Network  Catalyst’s thesis is that the future will hold thousands of modular blockchains that will need to communicate with each other. Modular blockchains are easier to deploy than traditional blockchains and break down the core functions of a blockchain into several different specialized blockchains.  “With the proliferation of rollups and app-specific chains, liquidity fragmentation is becoming a significant pain point and we have yet to see a unified liquidity layer that allows users to trade native assets seamlessly and efficiently cross-chain,” said Kelvin Koh, managing director of Spartan Group. “We believe Catalyst is in a great position to solve this pain point.”  A major challenge for the modular thesis, however, is attracting user activity onto its blockchains. “At the end of the day, all of these bridges are in a winner-takes-all race to build network effects,” Chang said.

The integration will allow MeWe's users to take control of their identity data and act as a foundation for controlling the data they have on social networks, the blockchain firm said.  Read full coverage of Consensus 2023 here.  Social networks create the so-called social graph to map the interconnection of relationships between people, things and interests. This key information mostly remains in the hands of big tech companies, and it is often used to cater advertisements to specific users. Think of how Spotify lets you see what your friends are listening to and suggests music to you.  At a panel at Consesus 2023, Braxton Woodham, president of Amplica Labs, a key contributor to the Frequency blockchain, said that ""we need to pull that power back"" from these private entities, and the teams are currently focused in making the whole web socially aware.  The Frequency blockchain creates a ""social identity"" that enables a user to be on the social graph, and which people can use across applications that sign onto this vision of Web3. This work is envisioned as a layer that permeates the web as key infrastructure. Users own their identities and control their privacy settings on different applications, Frequency said.  Frequency is a parachain of the Polkadot blockchain, meaning it sets its own rules and follows its own logic but is compatible with the main Polkadot chain as well as other parachains. Parachains pay a comprehensive lease to Polkadot, often with funds gathered from their communities, instead of a fee for each block. This boosts the system's scalability and stability, according to Frequency. As such, the Frequency blockchain can handle a lot of throughput, needed for social media applications.  MeWe users will be able to opt in to the Frequency blockchain adoption. The social media app was founded in 2012 as a social network with a focus on privacy.  The Frequency blockchain evolved out of work of the Decentralized Social Networking Protocol (DSNP), another technology that enables applications to deliver Web3 features to their users. DSNP was supported by Project Liberty, a non-profit funded by real estate billionaire Frank McCourt to disrupt social media.  In September 2022, McCourt Global, the billionaire's investment firm also led a $27 million investment round into MeWe. Amplica Labs, the key Frequency contributor and DSNP creator, is part of McCourt Global.

42393681,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj2LJ7,1682522718,"USDC Stablecoin Strengthened by U.S. Banking Crisis in March, Circle CEO Says","AUSTIN, Texas — The USDC stablecoin has emerged from March’s banking crisis stronger and safer, Jeremy Allaire, CEO of issuer Circle Internet Financial, said Wednesday.  USD coin, a critical rail for moving money through the crypto industry, lost its dollar peg in mid-March after Silicon Valley Bank’s failure temporarily imperiled billions of dollars of Circle's cash reserves. Though it quickly recovered ground, the event spooked investors and sparked massive outflows from the second-largest stablecoin. Circle held some of its USDC reserves at Silicon Valley Bank.  “We've successfully navigated this crisis, and have actually upgraded the market infrastructure behind USDC to be by far the strongest, safest digital dollar on the internet today, hands down, there's no question,” Allaire said on stage at CoinDesk’s Consensus conference here.  He drew a contrast between USDC and other “alternatives we don't know much about.” That unspoken competitor was tether (USDT), long the stablecoin market leader despite some critics’ misgivings about its banking relationships and backing.  But the market disagreed. Since March’s banking crisis, USDC’s market cap has fallen to $29 billion from $39 billion, according to Nansen. Tether, meantime, has gained market share.  Still, Allaire said USDC needs to become safer still. He said that can happen only with legislation at the federal level.

12115926,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=528649,1682521807,Bitcoin Bearish Signal: NVT Golden Cross Enters Overbought Zone,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross has entered into the overbought region, something that could be bearish for the price. Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross Has Been Going Up Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the most recent touch of this zone led to a drop in the price of the cryptocurrency. The “Network Value to Transactions” (NVT) is an indicator that measures the ratio between the market cap of Bitcoin and its transaction volume (both in USD). What this metric tells is whether the asset is overpriced or underpriced right now, based on how the value of the network (the market cap) compares with its ability to transact coins (the transaction volume). High values of the indicator suggest the cryptocurrency’s cap is inflated compared to its volume, and hence, the coin’s price may be overvalued currently. Similarly, low values can imply the asset may be undervalued at the moment. Now, a metric derived from the NVT is the “NVT Golden Cross,” which compares the 30-day moving average (MA) of the NVT with its 10-day MA. By taking the ratio of the long-term and short-term trends like this, the indicator can help point out the tops and bottoms in the NVT. Here is a chart that displays how the value of the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross has changed over the past year: The value of the metric seems to have been climbing in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As shown in the above graph, the quant has marked the historical regions where the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross has signaled underbought and overbought conditions for the asset. It looks like the values of the metric above 2.2 have been a sign that the cryptocurrency is undersold, while those below the -1.6 level have implied an oversold condition. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market At Decision Point: aSOPR Retests Crucial Level From the chart, it’s visible that the indicator touched the underpriced region last month, and the price reacted by observing some bullish momentum. Since then, the metric has seen an overall uptrend. A week or so ago, when Bitcoin was floating around the $30,000 level, the NVT Golden Cross entered inside the overpriced region. Following this formation, the price faced some severe drawdown as it plunged to the low $27,000 level. The metric cooled down for a while following this selloff, but in the past couple of days, it has once again risen to touch the red zone. This would mean that the asset may be becoming overbought again. Over the past day, however, Bitcoin has actually only observed some strong upwards momentum, as the coin’s value has now recovered to levels above $29,000 again. Related Reading: Polygon Exchange Supply Spikes, More Downtrend Incoming? In the past, tops haven’t always been immediately formed whenever the NVT Golden Cross has surged to this area, so this wouldn’t exactly be unprecedented. However, considering that the surge may have only made the coin more overpriced, a local top may be hit soon for the asset, if this metric’s pattern is anything to go by.

42393685,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj2LYV,1682521461,Why the Politics of Crypto Feels Different This Time,"Last week’s appearance by Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler before the House Financial Services Committee was his first in more than a year, and his first since the current Congress took over. The political shift in the House of Representatives to Republican control rapidly became glaringly obvious as the tone was markedly hostile. The agency’s approach to digital assets was a key point of contention.  As with most congressional hearings, the event was largely about making political points and grandstanding for the cameras. But it felt significant in that it revealed the scale of Republican dissatisfaction with Gensler’s administration, suggested several points that are likely to become campaign platforms, and publicly weakened the SEC chair’s credibility. That, in turn, could prompt some modifications to the agency’s approach.  Normally the public doesn’t care too much about financial regulation. But the rhetoric witnessed last week indicates that politicians could start to make sure they do. No longer is it just about financial disclosures and settlement rules: It is rapidly becoming about individual freedom and U.S. pride.  Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.  The full video makes for compelling although occasionally frustrating viewing. Here are some of the key highlights:  Ahead of the hearing, around 30 elected representatives signed a letter “blasting” (their word) Gensler for misrepresenting the digital asset platform registration process. This is something the crypto community has been complaining about for some time, but the tone of the message and the public offices of the signatories signal a notable escalation.  This became even more apparent as the hearing kicked off with House Financial Services Committee Chairman Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) coming out swinging. McHenry highlighted, among other things, the inconsistency with which Gensler throws out crypto enforcement actions, asks for extra budget funding and yet refuses to give clarity as to the application of securities laws to digital assets and their service providers.  McHenry pointedly asked Gensler several times if ether (ETH) was a security, and each time Gensler attempted to trot out the standard Howey definition without answering the question.  McHenry also attempted to get Gensler to acknowledge that the rules are not clear. Gensler continued to insist they were plenty clear (that sound you hear is lawyers guffawing), but that he couldn’t say anything about any specific asset.  Gensler endured a fierce takedown by House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) who highlighted the SEC’s inconsistency in both its reach (Gensler has often said the rules cover the industry adequately; he has also said he needs additional congressional authority to be able to cover the industry) and its approach (all firms need to do is register, but there is no applicable registration process).  Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio) pointed out that Gensler’s SEC approved the pre-initial public offering (IPO) documents of the Coinbase crypto exchange, which described in detail its staking procedures and other operations, allowing retail investors to purchase shares. Two years later, the SEC sent a Wells Notice to the company, implying concerns about the legality of some unspecified listed digital assets, the staking service, the crypto wallet and other areas of the business.  After reciting a litany of failures, Davidson introduced a bill to remove Gensler from office.  To be fair, the hearing wasn’t all about perceived SEC failures and shortcomings. Some committee members praised Gensler for his bold approach in reforming securities clearing and for “standing up to crypto bro billionaires” (did he, though?). And many of the Republican critiques were not about the agency’s crypto approach but about its move into policing the environmental impact of listed companies and other initiatives that would add to the compliance burden of smaller businesses.  Read more: Bitcoin’s 'Store-of-Value' Narrative Is Real but Not a Price Mover  The political nature of the questions was quite clear, however, with Republicans against and Democrats supportive of the current SEC leadership. Davidson’s bill proposing the firing of Gensler is unlikely to progress, but it loudly trumpets that the battle is getting more intense. It’s a curious battle to pick, given the broad range of hot issues likely to dominate the rapidly approaching 2024 presidential election campaign. In any political competition the opposition finds a weakness and attempts to escalate it to the public consciousness in order to score points and shift perception of the incumbents. That digital assets are a key protagonist of the current positioning is a strong message for the Republicans to send.  What’s more, they’re not pulling their punches. This isn’t just about financial oversight or administrative inefficiency. Nor is it just about the functioning of capital markets. Most voters don’t care too much about that. Some of the statements made clear that this was about much bigger issues.  One is patriotism. Emmer was not the only one to remind Gensler that his actions are encouraging U.S. businesses to change jurisdiction, but he went as far as accusing the SEC chair of “pushing American firms into the hands of the CCP,” referring to the Chinese Communist Party. Some hot buttons are being pushed there, especially when Gensler did not have a memorable rebuttal to any of the allegations.  Another is individual freedom. Emmer and others brought up the politicization of capital formation, but the mic drop belongs to Davidson with the following quote that we are likely to hear again:  “You can’t just exclude retail investors from markets and claim it’s for their own good.”  Read more: Bitcoin and the Changing Definition of 'Safety'  There is still quite a while between now and the U.S. election in November 2024, and a lot can happen in the interim. It’s unclear to what extent the current administration will dig in and back Gensler in his digital asset approach. A recent report on the crypto ecosystem from the White House Council of Economic Advisers was not exactly encouraging, and President Joe Biden’s team may be loath to give the Republicans what could look like a win. Or, it could be that Gensler’s bosses decide that this is not a hill to die on, especially as the noise of high-profile suits involving the SEC gets louder and especially if the regulator starts losing.  Either way, digital assets are likely to increasingly form part of the political discourse. This will broaden awareness as observers choose their sides, either sticking to party lines or perhaps switching sides as the ideological divide widens.  A bigger takeaway, though, is that the digital asset ecosystem is moving from market niche to political platform. Last week, crypto entrepreneur Ryan Selkis announced the launch of a $100 million multi-entity pro-crypto political campaign, and the industry has many influential protagonists who will either join or form similar initiatives.  Uncertainty is never comfortable, but we can take a moment to appreciate the attention, even if it’s not the type of attention the industry had hoped for. You know what they say: The only thing worse than people saying bad things about you is people not talking about you at all. While I’m not sure I believe that, it does shed light on the importance of where the ecosystem is on this journey.  To see it take up so much of politicians’ time, whatever the stance, is a sign that the industry has a seat at an ever-bigger table. Politics changes, and regulators come and go.

42393686,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj2Lnt,1682521018,"Bittrex Global CEO Says Firm Will Fight SEC Charges, Did Not Serve U.S. Customers","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is “mistaken” in charging crypto exchange Bittrex Global GmbH with breach of local securities law, Chief Executive Officer Oliver Linch said during a phone interview with CoinDesk on Monday.  On April 17, the SEC charged Bittrex Inc. and its former CEO William Shihara with operating an unregistered securities exchange, broker and clearing agency in the U.S. In the same complaint, the regulator accused Bittrex Global GmbH of failing to register as a securities exchange “in connection with its operation of a single shared order book” with U.S.’ Bittrex.  The regulator alleged both Bittrex and Bittrex Global should have registered as an exchange because they “brought together” securities orders of multiple buyers and sellers “using established, non-discretionary methods under which such orders interacted.”  “Bittrex also provides Bittrex Global with the technology to operate its trading platform, including a single matching engine and order book that Bittrex Global shares with Bittrex, both of which are maintained by Bittrex personnel in the United States,” the complaint said.  The complaint added that the “design and functionality of the Bittrex Platform is similar to those of properly registered national securities exchanges,” from its display and order book to order matching and trading rules.  “We've not really seen an explanation as to what the SEC’s thinking is there, why that is of significance,” Linch said, referring to allegations of a shared order book. “Suffice to say, we think that they're mistaken in the way they conceive of it legally and in terms of facts.”  Bittrex Global didn’t know it was the subject of an SEC probe until it received notice that the agency had “reached a preliminary conclusion,” according to Linch. He added the regulator didn’t give the firm an opportunity to “explain the facts.”  'Never' served U.S. customers  Linch, who was appointed Bittrex Global CEO last year, said the firm “never purported to offer services” in the U.S. and that it will “vigorously” defend its position that it does not have any customers in the country.  The SEC is facing questions from the industry after a string of recent enforcement actions and notices of scrutiny prompted a couple of firms, including Bittrex Inc., to shutter some or all operations in the country. The industry has criticized the SEC for choosing to regulate by enforcement instead of providing regulatory clarity to firms.  After filing suit against Bittrex, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said the agency’s action “makes plain that the crypto markets suffer from a lack of regulatory compliance, not a lack of regulatory clarity"" because the complaint alleged Bittrex’s former CEO Shihara worked with crypto issuers to remove wording that indicated the assets in question were securities.  While it was a “sad day” for Bittrex, its shuttering does not affect his firm’s operations globally, Linch said.  “Bittrex was an entirely separate legal entity and only provided services in the U.S. and only served U.S. customers. And they're the ones that have had to shut down their operations … Global continues on providing the services to rest-of-world clients as it ever has,” he said.  The SEC has said it believes Binance.US is operating an unregistered securities exchange. While its global counterpart Binance maintains the U.S. entity is separate and distinct, with the action against Bittrex Global it’s unclear if the regulator will also take aim at other players in the industry.  Linch didn’t comment on specific firms but praised crypto regulatory regimes in other jurisdictions.  “What we're seeing is a growing realization that the most successful regulatory regimes are ones that have created a framework for crypto on a bespoke basis,” Linch said. “Now, that's why we're regulated in Liechtenstein in Bermuda, because what those jurisdictions did really early on is really get to grips with crypto, what the product is, what services, what the risks are, and say to people, ‘OK, well, we can identify and manage. Here's how you do it safely.’”  Last week, SEC’s Gensler faced tough questions from U.S. lawmakers on his handling of the crypto sector, while the European Parliament voted through its landmark crypto licensing regime.  The Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework will apply to the European Union’s 27 member states as well as the three additional states – Liechtenstein, Norway and Iceland – that make up the European Economic Area. The regime sets out requirements for crypto service providers and issuers that must be implemented on a national level.  In addition to the EU, jurisdictions from Dubai to Hong Kong are looking to supervise crypto in a holistic way, Linch said, adding that his years of experience as a financial regulatory lawyer in the U.K. taught him that bad cases make for bad law.  “Ultimately, this is for Congress to sort. If it wants to set up a regulatory regime, set up a regulatory regime,” Linch said of the U.S.  The SEC declined to comment “beyond the public filings.”  Read more: Crypto Exchange Bittrex Violated Federal Laws, SEC Charges in Lawsuit",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/04/26/bittrex-global-ceo-says-firm-will-fight-sec-charges-did-not-serve-us-customers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7583fe886dcc1dc92bb9d782e338175f7cda355e-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This notable price dip left everyone wondering if Cardano (ADA) will break this barrier, which has proven significant in recent trading sessions. However, today April 26, the general market is recovering as the global market cap gained over a 4.5% increase in 24 hours. The marker-wide rally has pushed ADA back to the $0.40 mark with a massive gain of 6.93% in 24 hours. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Plunges Over 13% – Will It Bounce Back? The ADA price has been trending downward for the past 7 days, and the coin is finally gaining momentum. Only time will tell if Cardano ADA can surpass the $0.41 resistance level and trade above it in the coming days. ADA Price Trend The recent price fluctuation in the crypto market harmed Cardano (ADA)’s price, causing a significant loss in its market capitalization. The Cardano market cap is currently at $13.9 billion with a $267 million 24-hour trading volume. According to CoinMarketCap data, Cardano (ADA) is now the seventh biggest cryptocurrency. Cardano’s price drop yesterday, April 25, may have been caused by several variables, such as market sentiment generally and shifts in investor perceptions. Also, the fluctuations in trading volume, regulatory announcements, or market news that impacted the cryptocurrency market may have played a huge role too. The chart below shows the potential support and resistance levels for Cardano (ADA) in 2023. While buyers are trying to build a bullish momentum, ADA is still found at the $0.40 zone and might break the support zone of $0.38 if the sellers increase the selling pressure. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Rebounding After A Major Drop, Will It Recover Previous Losses? The $0.38 level of support has maintained steady during the retest earlier this week and can act as a driving force for a higher valuation. Cardano’s price may surpass its resistance level of $0.42 if the bulls completely control the market. On the other hand, if bears take control of the trend, ADA’s price could fall below $0.30 and might hit $0.2777 Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction The Simple Moving Average (SMA) indicates a potential trend reversal as the 50-day SMA changes directions. The 50-day SMA is trying to cross below the 200, forming a death cross. This action may generate a bearish signal and indicate a potential selling opportunity. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is above the neutral level and is heading toward the overbought zone, which might ignite a potential price correction. The MACD line is above the signal line, indicating a potential buy opportunity. The histogram is slightly above the zero line and is also increasing in size; this means bullish momentum.

42393687,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj2M3H,1682519174,Please Enjoy the Final Crypto Winter,"Got your skis on? If not, clip in and try to have some fun because this is going to be our very last crypto winter. We’ve had two or three, depending on how you count and this one has certainly been the worst and the most frustrating, but fortunately, it’s going to be the final one and let me explain why: Crypto and blockchain are on the cusp of becoming ordinary, regulated businesses. While it’s always extremely difficult to separate signals from noise, I see three big positive signs for the future.  Paul Brody is EY's global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist.  Surge in enforcement actions by law enforcement  The world of crypto and blockchain has always had an uncomfortable relationship between starry-eyed do-gooders (count me among that crowd) and ruthless opportunists trying to hijack that message to sell whatever they’ve come up with. One of things that has been immensely frustrating over the years is seeing the warnings we and others have made about the dangerous, speculative and downright absurd nature of some crypto and blockchain investments go unheeded. We (EY) warned about the abysmal track record of initial coin offerings (ICO) in 2018 and again in 2019 and we were hardly alone in expressing our concerns. Enforcement actions are much more effective than warnings and social-media flame-wars.  Contradictions and inconsistencies in public policies  Many countries, the U.S. first and foremost, have complex and decentralized regulatory systems. If we can’t get everyone in the world of blockchain to agree upon what policies should be, we should not be surprised that regulators are not fully and immediately in agreement either. What is useful is that the legal system must try to make some consistent sense of how the law is applied. In those cases, regulators must present a clear and consistent opinion of what the law means. This clarity will take some time to emerge, but it is coming.  Maturing industry leadership and product  The boom-and-bust cycle of the tech industry tends to happen when expectations and excitement far outstrip the capacity of companies to actually deliver products and earn revenues. This happened in tech in the early 1980s, when video game consoles and PCs arrived on the scene but before the world had found the right applications to drive enterprise adoption. A second, much larger, boom cycle emerged in the late 1990s as network technologies and the internet generated tremendous excitement but not much in the way of revenue or profits. Not dissimilar to many blockchain and crypto business models in 2018-2022, the dot-com bubble saw companies go public or raise hundreds of millions of dollars without meaningful revenue streams, or occasionally without even well-structured business plans.  The parallels with the dot-com boom and related bust are worth remembering. Both industries saw huge growth in investment and valuations based on seemingly impossible promises of future capability. Back in 1999, about $350 billion in digital online transactions occurred and most of that was using legacy B2B systems such as Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), not consumer e-commerce from a web browser. Bold predictions made at the peak of the dot-com boom by major investment banks, academics and forecasting firms said that between $4 trillion and $6 trillion in online commerce would take place annually by 2005. This proved to be laughable. In fact, total e-commerce (of the consumer web-browser kind) reached $105 billion in 2005. No surprise that market valuations plunged and many of the generously funded companies involved went bust. In the year 2000 alone, nearly $1.75 trillion in technology market capitalization evaporated. For those of you keeping score at home, that is about $3 trillion in 2023 dollars and more than the entire market cap of the blockchain ecosystem.  And this is where the story gets interesting: Today, e-commerce and online business is everything we were promised in 1999. Total global e-commerce spending is estimated to be nearing $5 trillion in 2022. It topped $1 trillion in the U.S. alone in 2022. The market capitalization of the world’s top 10 technology companies is about $7 trillion. Technology stocks represent more of the U.S. stock market than the financial sector and the energy sector combined. And while there have been ups and downs, there hasn’t been a single technology bust since 2000. The reason for that is simple: Technology has become a regular industry where valuations are driven by revenue and profit growth, not starry-eyed predictions of the future.  The signs of maturing blockchain and crypto products and businesses are starting to emerge as well. While it’s early days yet overall, non-fungible tokens (NFT) seem to have found a permanent place in the user and business ecosystem both as collectibles and as digital trophies, tickets and proof of engagement or attendance. NFTs have become so simple and easy to make, anyone can offer them. Would you like my personal NFT for the month? Claim it here. At EY, “boring” businesses like supply chain management, product traceability and emissions tracking are all growing as industrial companies put blockchain to work for use cases that have nothing to do with financial engineering. Privacy technology (not to be confused with anonymity) has proven key to unlocking practical use cases among companies that want to leverage shared, public technology infrastructure without sharing their sensitive business information.  As we clear a path through the wreckage of the crypto winter, the same bright future is coming for the blockchain industry. Bad actors are going to jail. Rules are getting clearer. And, most importantly, the companies involved in this ecosystem are starting to build real products and have valuations based on revenue and profits. The result is that blockchain and crypto can become regular industries with regulated products and outputs that are widely accessible. As a regular industry we will still have ups and downs, but we’ll no longer have ridiculous booms and busts. So please enjoy this crypto winter. It’s the last one you’re getting.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Paul Brody,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/04/26/us-crypto-regulations-end-crypto-winter-opinion,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c4d88bcb745d050a03d9ca23d8589504428233de-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

And Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith has been at the forefront of that charge. Today, few could say U.S. regulators and legislators are being ambivalent about crypto – even if they haven't exactly figured out how to treat this nascent industry.  This article is excerpted from The Node newsletter, which will send two editions daily during the Consensus 2023 conference running down the biggest news from the event. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here or get IRL or virtual tickets for Consensus 2023 here.  CoinDesk sat down with Smith ahead of Consensus 2023 to get her thoughts on the current regulatory moment, the policies crypto needs and life as a lobbyist on the Hill.  What do you make of the term ""Operation Choke Point 2.0,"" coined to describe a seemingly coordinated effort among various U.S. government agencies to dislocate crypto from the wider economy?  Blockchain Association is currently investigating claims of crypto de-banking, launching a tipline – debanked@theblockchainassociation.org – and asking industry participants to come forward with stories. We’re committed to discovering the truth about these allegations.  Do you think we could expect to see comprehensive crypto regulation in the U.S. this year or in the coming years?  The industry will likely have to wait 18 to 22 months to see real movement. However, we are still in a period of great opportunity to continue educating and laying the foundation for a strong regulatory future.  Could you give us an inside view into your work in Washington. D.C.? Are you finding it easier to engage with policymakers these days?  Policymaker education is critical – and that’s our top priority at Blockchain Association. We have found that many policymakers are open to learning more about the technology and we believe that greater acceptance will come as people become more knowledgeable about the space.  What does Sen. Elizabeth Warren's [D-Mass.] anti-crypto army say, if anything, about the role crypto will play in the coming election cycle?  The senator has embraced the term “anti-crypto” when describing her critical views of the space. However, her views rarely reflect that of the mainstream, even within the Democratic party. Advocates are already pushing back in preparation for the next election cycle. The Blockchain Association is building a pro-crypto army, and continues to educate willing policymakers.  In a word, how would you describe your outlook regarding crypto policy in the U.S.?  Bright.

The paper turns on its head central bankers’ conventional wisdom that individuals shouldn’t be allowed more than a few thousand euros' worth of the central bank digital currency to prevent them from using it as a savings vehicle.  The banking industry issued a sigh of relief when Fabio Panetta, a member of the European Central Bank's board, said individual users of the digital currency would be limited to holding around 3,000 euros ($3,317) worth at a time because he wants the CBDC used only for day-to-day payments.  Panetta’s goals for the project are wrong, said the report produced by academic Christian Hofmann at the request of the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee.  “The key role of a digital euro consists of the important role it can play as a store-of-value option for the public,” said Hofmann, who is an associate professor at the National University of Singapore. “All of this requires that the public’s access to a digital euro is unlimited.”  Even though the study doesn’t bind the parliament, some lawmakers are thinking on similar lines.  “I have strong doubts about the restrictions” on holdings, socialist Dutch lawmaker Paul Tang told the chamber in a debate last week, arguing the CBDC should compete with banks. “A digital euro should be viable – why use something you can hardly hold?”  Central bankers such as Panetta have warned that a mass exodus from commercial banks could choke lending and damage financial stability.

While the one-day chart reflects a 3% increase, the weekly chart shows a decline of over 12%. Buyers have faced resistance in the $0.45-$0.46 range and the technical outlook for XRP indicates a selling trend. The demand for this altcoin has also dropped, leading to a decrease in accumulation. Unless buyers return to the market and stabilize the price, XRP is likely to continue losing value. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price has remained uncertain over the past week, and its recent climb above $28,000 may inspire other altcoins to follow suit. Related Reading: 37 Billion Dogecoin Holdings In Jeopardy: Price Level Investors Should Watch For XRP to see upward momentum, Bitcoin must maintain a price above $27,000. Furthermore, XRP must surpass the immediate resistance level to preserve its current support level. The decline in XRP’s market capitalization suggests that sellers are currently in control of the market. XRP Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, the altcoin’s trading price is $0.47, and it currently stands above its critical support level of $0.46. Despite attempting to recover significantly over the past few weeks, XRP experienced considerable selling pressure in the past week. The coin faces overhead resistance at $0.48, and breaching that level could drive the price up to $0.50. Conversely, if XRP fails to remain above $0.46, the coin may decline to around $0.42 and possibly $0.40. The amount of XRP traded in the last session was negative, indicating a decrease in demand. Technical Analysis Despite the daily chart indicating a recovery, buyers seemed hesitant to make a move. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) was below 50, implying that sellers currently outnumber buyers. Although there was an uptick in the RSI, buying strength remained fragile unless XRP surpasses the immediate resistance level. Furthermore, the altcoin was below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, indicating that sellers were driving the price momentum in the market. Aligned with other technical indicators, the altcoin began to exhibit sell signals on the one-day chart. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) displays price momentum and trend reversals. Red histograms formed under the half-line, indicating a sell signal for the altcoin and a bearish price. The Bollinger Bands measure price volatility and potential price fluctuations of the asset. The bands diverged in anticipation of incoming price volatility, with the upper band serving as a vital resistance level for the altcoin.

Wainwright on market share prospects,"H.C. Wainwright started coverage of Coinbase Global ( NASDAQ: COIN ) with a Buy rating on Wednesday on expectations that the ""dominant"" U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange will benefit from the growing industry and thus gain more market share this year. COIN jumped 6.7% in premarket trading as bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) erased losses over the past five days, surging 9.1% to $29.9K, as solid Big Tech first-quarter earnings sparked a rally across the stock market. The company ""is uniquely positioned to benefit from the large and rapidly growing global crypto economy given its trusted brand, easy to use products, and focus on compliance and regulation, and we expect the company to gain market share in 2023,"" analyst Mike Colonnese wrote in a note. Calling Coinbase ( COIN ) a ""scarce asset,"" Colonnese pointed out that it's the only publicly-listed crypto-focused firm in the U.S. with a market cap exceeding $10B, meaning ""competition for investor capital is extremely limited."" And with the stock trading at a 35% discount to historical levels (3.6 times 2023 estimated revenue), the note said, ""we believe current price levels offer an attractive entry point for investors."" As such, he reckons the Wells notice-inspired pullback is overdone despite potential near-term risks associated with regulatory headwinds. Earlier this week, the firm sued the Securities and Exchange Commission to compel the regulator to respond with a ""yes"" or ""no"" to its July 2022 petition asking it to use its formal rulemaking process to provide guidance for the crypto industry.

The decisive impulse was provided yesterday by the news that with First Republic Bank the next big bank in the US is about to be seized by the US Federal Reserve and FDIC. As was the case after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, the news triggered a rally for Bitcoin that initially catapulted the price above the crucial $27,800 resistance level before a brief consolidation and then continuation of the price surge took place. With the reaction, Bitcoin is strengthening its digital gold narrative. As analyst James V. Straten predicts, the correlation between Bitcoin and gold will continue to increase as interest rates remain high and weak banks are purged. Even on a 30-day rolling average, the correlation stands at 57%, its highest level in almost 2 years.

According to Choi, the second wave of bank failures, led by First Republic Bank, will cause the Fed to pump more liquidity into the financial system. The “market is a liquidity junkie and already pricing this in.” As Bitcoinist reported today, the M2 money supply has fallen to a historic 90-year low.

Vertex, which had been operating on a test network, combines an off-chain order book layered on top of an on-chain automated market maker on a decentralized, self-custodial exchange. The firm, which has bases in Singapore and the Cayman Islands, counts Jane Street, Dexterity Capital, Hudson River Trading, GSR, Collab+Currency, JST Capital, Big Brain and Lunatic Capital among its early backers.  The messy collapse of FTX and other centralized trading platform blowups last year has fueled a shift toward decentralized exchanges and self-custody. Ethereum layer 2 system Arbitrum is now the fastest-growing blockchain in total value locked and has surpassed Ethereum in daily transaction volume.  The Vertex team has been working on the protocol for about a year. Co-founder Darius Tabatabai said the platform has drawn interest from institutional traders and from retail traders who use Arbitrum.  “We built all the smart contracting ourselves, so we’re not forking anything,” Tabatabai said in an interview with CoinDesk. “The [automated market maker] is quite conventional, but we have a bunch of tech under the surface that enables you to do leveraged AMMs, to do looping, and we have an inbuilt money market. So you can think of it as a combination of Aave, dYdX and Uniswap, with an order book.”  Building Vertex on Arbitrum and using an off-chain sequencer for the order book has enabled the venue to process between 10,000 and 15,000 transactions per second with the ability to match buy and sell orders in 10 to 30 milliseconds, a speed that rivals leading centralized venues and surpasses that on other decentralized exchanges, Tabatabai added.",POSITIVE,ARB,ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | ARB,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/04/26/decentralized-exchange-vertex-launches-on-ethereum-layer-2-arbitrum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c7bf576207ea8ec81e6232fc60869d6b44ccc195-1280x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393682,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj2LOF,1682511737,"Arbitrum Airdrops $120M to Projects; Some Dump, Some Look to Bolster Themselves","Ethereum scaling blockchain Arbitrum on Tuesday completed the distribution of more than $120 million worth of its arb (ARB) tokens to projects that were built on the network, blockchain data shows.  In March, Arbitrum issued and airdropped its tokens to individual users in amounts ranging from 625 arb to over 10,000 arb, based on their network activity and number of wallets.  Airdrops occur when crypto projects send free tokens to their communities in a bid to encourage adoption. Crypto users who frequently interact with new and existing platforms are likely to receive an airdrop at some point. That has spurred the narrative of “airdrop farming” because large airdrops can be valued at thousands of dollars in effectively free money at peak.  Projects that built on the Arbitrum network, such as perpetual trading protocol GMX and token launchpad Camelot, were eligible for the airdrop, receiving tokens in proportion to the number of smart contract deployments, users and trading volumes, among other factors.  For some, like Vesta Finance, the airdrop provided a multimillion-dollar stimulus: The project was eligible for 2.7 million arb tokens, worth just under $6 million, despite holding only $3 million in its treasury. This can allow the project to, over time, sell the tokens to bolster its own development or even provide token incentives to users to further jumpstart activity.  Projects such as yield rewards-focused PlutusDAO said they will use their airdrop allocation in “multiple ways to make the project stronger,” without revealing specifics.  Other projects decided to sell as soon as they received the tokens, however. Gaming-focused TridentDAO sold $175,000 worth of arb, or half the amount it received, through three addresses. The move invited criticism from the community for its action.  On-chain data compiled by Lookonchain shows some 90 million ARB tokens – about $120 million at current prices – were sent to over 131 decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs. NFT marketplace TreasureDAO and GMX received the most at 8 million arb, or $12 million.  These were followed by decentralized exchanges SushiSwap, Balance, Uniswap, Curve, and Dopex, which will each receive between 3 million and 5 million ARB tokens.",NEUTRAL,ARB,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TRADING | ARB | AIRDROP,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/26/arbitrum-airdrops-120m-to-projects-some-dump-some-look-to-bolster-themselves,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5e48c82dbe5c106b9e24fceed14c77ef575c07e0-1438x809.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It experienced a price drop from $8.8784 on April 18, 2023, to $7.7704 on April 19, and its trading volume is down by over 4% in the last 24 hours. Chainlink’s ecosystem rolled out new developmental trends and innovative partnerships. Its recent integration with the Celo ecosystem will create a framework for launching Chainlink oracles on Celo and the seamless creation of decentralized applications. The price pullback in April hinted at the possibility of a bear market. However, the signs are positive today for LINK as its gains in the market. Crypto Market Rally Evident In LINK’s Price Action According to CoinMarketCap data, the global crypto market capitalization is up by $3.58% in 24 hours. Also, the total crypto market volume is $41.50 billion, a significant increase of 15.94. Bitcoin’s dominance has significantly increased in the past 24 hours. Notably, most altcoins correlate to Bitcoin’s price. The general crypto market outlook improved as it shows signs of recovery today. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Plunges Over 13% – Will It Bounce Back? However, the sustainability of the present positive trend largely depends on market forces and investor sentiments. LINK’s current price action indicates the possibility of a rally ahead. A closer look at its performance will provide vital answers. Chainlink Pivots At The 200-day SMA, Are We In A Bull Run? LINK is in an uptrend on the daily chart. It is building on its gains yesterday to halt the bearish trend. It bounced off the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) yesterday to begin its recovery. LINK is currently above its 50-day and 200-day SMA, with bullish sentiment in the short and long term. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 48.32, in the neutral zone and moving upwards. It implies that the asset will likely experience further price increases if the bulls sustain the current rally. LINK’s Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is still below its signal line and showing a negative value. The indicator reflects the bearish pressure on the asset in the past week. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Rebounding After A Major Drop, Will It Recover Previous Losses? However, the histogram bars are faint, suggesting a possible trend reversal ahead. Despite the current price increase, further confirmation is vital to determine if a bull run is underway. LINK found support at the $6.947 price level, with $5.9 and $6.75 being other critical support levels upholding its price. However, its nearest resistance level, $7.456, is vital to its trend direction. A break above this level will confirm that LINK has moved into an uptrend. Other key resistance levels are $7.735, $8.397, and $8.48. LINK will likely break the $7.456 resistance in the coming days if the bulls sustain their charge.

Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, rose 4.5%. The moves up come as concerns over U.S. banking stability ramp up again, with shares of First Republic Bank (FRC) dropping 50% on Tuesday after the San Francisco-based lender revealed that customers pulled more than $100 billion from their accounts last month. The slide stressed U.S. markets, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1% and tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 fell almost 2% on Tuesday.  Joseph Seibert, who was head of digital assets at Signature Bank, and four members of his Signet team have joined Fortress Trust, a Nevada-based chartered trust company that specializes in cryptocurrency and Web3. Signature Bank, which was a crypto-friendly institution, was shut down in March after depositors withdrew large sums of money following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, another bank with crypto ties. Signet was a payments platform that was popular with Signature's institutional crypto customers.  Talos, a crypto trading platform for institutional investors, is working with Coinbase Prime to expand access to digital assets for customers of both firms. With rising demand from institutional investors for more secure and efficient trading platforms, the agreement offers Talos customers access to Coinbase Prime for spot liquidity and custody services, according to a press release.

42420731,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqdIb,1682506800,How the Hunt for Yet-to-Exist Tokens Is Shaping Ethereum’s Layer 2 Landscape,"Arbitrum, the layer 2 “rollup” network for the Ethereum blockchain, has become the clear frontrunner in a crowded race among networks competing to offer lower fees and higher speeds to users.  The competition to help scale Ethereum is developing at a rapid pace – viewed as an attractive and potentially lucrative arena for entrepreneurs, venture capitalists and technologists looking to attract the next wave of crypto-users, by offering them easy access to the second-biggest blockchain. In the past two months alone the venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and exchange behemoth Coinbase have both said they were building Ethereum layer 2s, which is the term used to describe these blockchain scaling systems.  One could argue that tracking this space has never been more crucial, with Ethereum at an inflection point having just completed its transition to a fully functional proof-of-stake blockchain. New entrants to the competition known as “zkEVMs” – layer 2 scaling products built on an increasingly popular type of cryptography known as zero-knowledge proofs – have sprung onto the scene.  This article originally appeared in The Protocol, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  What can sometimes be hard to tease out, however, is how much of any given project’s success is due to its technological superiority or merely due to users trying to capture a slice of funnel-down marketing dollars in the form of rewards tokens or other freebies. The layer 2 race has highlighted how the crypto industry’s proclivity for “airdrops” and other handouts – new tokens that get printed out of thin air and distributed to project users – remains a driving force in shaping the sector.  Arbitrum has long been a leader in Ethereum’s scaling race, but it saw a surge of growth last month when it released ARB – a new token that was “airdropped” to people based on how much they’d used the network in the past. The potential for more surprise paydays is shaping the layer 2 landscape beyond Arbitrum as well, sending users to projects such as zkSync that have yet to launch tokens, and away from projects like Polygon zkEVM that already have.  Airdrops, and the prospect of them, have proven a compelling customer acquisition strategy for up-and-coming chains. Whether this familiar formula for attracting users and capital is sustainable, however, remains uncertain.  A key takeaway is that the money-grabs may obscure the early data signals on which technological platforms work the best.  What are Ethereum’s rollup networks?  Ethereum is the second-largest blockchain behind Bitcoin, based on the total value of crypto locked into its ecosystem. More than a means of tracking and trading its native currency, ETH, Ethereum is a multibillion-dollar platform for blockchain-based games, financial apps and countless other tools and tokens.  Rollup networks emerged as a result of Ethereum’s high fees and relative sluggishness – which became a massive deterrent for many would-be Ethereum users during the last crypto bull run, when high user demand clogged up the network and its speed and cost issues became more apparent.  Ethereum’s core developers – co-founder Vitalik Buterin among them – eventually expect rollups to become the primary on-ramp by which users access the chain, and combined traffic across all layer 2 platforms (a loosely defined category that includes scaling solutions like rollups) has recently begun to surpass that of the base Ethereum chain.  Arbitrum, one such rollup network, operates like a separate blockchain alongside Ethereum. Like all rollups, it bundles up transactions from users and then passes them down to Ethereum for “settlement,” where they’re officially written to Ethereum’s digital ledger book.  Rollups have special systems in place to prove that the transactions they pass down to Ethereum borrow that main network’s core security apparatus – meaning that if a user makes a transaction on a rollup network, the user can (in theory) take solace knowing that it will be passed down to Ethereum with zero alterations.  Arbitrum’s spot at the top  Arbitrum was the first Etheruem rollup network to launch, and it remains the largest by far in terms of transaction volume and the value of crypto locked into its ecosystem. According to L2beat, a website that tracks Ethereum’s layer 2 landscape, the chain has $6 billion worth of crypto circulating on it (total value locked, or TVL) and has processed more transactions in the past month than Ethereum itself.  Arbitrum’s primary competitor, Optimism, has a TVL of $1.93 billion and has processed one-third as many transactions in the past 30 days.  Arbitrum’s lead over Optimism expanded significantly last month with the release of ARB – a governance token that can be bought and sold, and grants holders the right to vote on changes to Arbitrum’s ecosystem.  ARB was framed publicly as a way to decentralize the Arbitrum blockchain, moving ultimate control of the chain from its original developers, Offchain Labs, to newly minted ARB token holders. The real reason a project like Arbitrum might launch a token is more complicated than “decentralization,” however.  On the more cynical end, a new token can be a way to reward early contributors without catching the eye of securities regulators: Around half of ARB’s supply went to Offchain’s employees and investors. (Some investor/employee tokens were subject to lockup periods, similar to how traditional companies may delay the delivery of equity to prevent an immediate sell-off.)  But beyond rewarding contributors or bringing Arbitrum more in line with crypto’s decentralized ethos, the ARB token accomplished something before it even existed: It helped grow the chain’s user base.  Arbitrum airdropped a percentage of ARB’s circulating supply to existing users of the chain – a welcome surprise to many, but a long-awaited payday for those who had only ever used Arbitrum to “farm” for potential ARB tokens.  Using an airdrop – or the prospect of one – to attract users can be like walking a tightrope. If done wrong, mercenary airdrop farmers will just sell their new tokens and move on to other soon-to-tokenize chains.  By all early measures, Arbitrum seems to have done a good job of retaining users since the ARB token launch. Though there was a sharp rise and steep drop in network activity around the time of ARB’s release, it’s now been around a month since the ARB airdrop, the chain now processes around 35% more transactions per second than it did before ARB was announced.  Arbitrum’s success with ARB contrasts with the blunder that was the OP airdrop – the token launch for Optimism. Both networks faced technical challenges and scored some own-goals in the execution of their airdrops, but the Optimism token price plummeted in the month after it launched, whereas Arbitrum’s has stayed somewhat stable. A month after the Optimism airdrop, moreover, activity levels on the chain were similar to where they were before the drop – hinting that OP may not have helped much in terms of retaining new users.  One argument for why ARB has so far succeeded where OP struggled may be that Optimism deployed its token prematurely.  Nansen, a crypto analytics firm, helped Arbitrum set the parameters for its airdrop. According to Nansen research analyst Yohji van Weert, “Arbitrum did it better than Optimism in the sense that they already had a very mature ecosystem” when it announced ARB. By contrast, says van Weert, Optimism – which came out around the same time as Arbitrum but released its token nearly a year earlier – “was at a pretty early stage when they released their token” and struggled to retain users as a result.  ZkEVMs take center stage  Arbitrum may be the current frontrunner in Ethereum’s rollup race, but its spot at the top of the layer 2 hierarchy may not last for long.  Most watching Ethereum’s rollup race have moved beyond optimistic rollups like Arbitrum and Optimism towards their fancier new cousins – zkEVMs. ZkEVMs (Zero-knowledge Ethereum virtual machines) are an up-and-coming type of rollup that operate with the same bundle-and-settle principle as Optimistic rollups but use zero-knowledge cryptography to power their security.  Read more: The Sudden Rise of EVM-Compatible ZK Rollups  ZkEVM tech is at an earlier stage of development than Optimistic tech, but zkEVM builders such as Matter Labs and Polygon have already launched beta versions of their ecosystems to plenty of community hype.  After months of public posturing and social media spatting by their CEOs regarding which company would be “first” to market, zkSync surged decidedly ahead of Polygon zkEVM when the platforms opened to users within days of one another. Today, there is $240 million circulating inside of zkSync Era’s ecosystem and just $5 million in Polygon zkEVM.  Matter Labs will say that zkSync’s success comes from superior technology. But Polygon’s tech, by all early measures, is nothing to scoff at. “It’s very easy to deploy a contract” on Polygon zkEVM, van Weert explained. “It’s almost as simple as on Ethereum.”  The problem for Polygon is with incentives. “Most of the capital is flowing into zkSync,” explained van Weert, “mainly because of the airdrop speculation.” The ARB airdrop “led to a lot of capital rotating from Arbitrum to zkSync in hopes of a potential airdrop, whereas Polygon – they already have a token.”  ZkSync is expected to eventually distribute a token. In interviews and public statements, Matter Labs – like Offchain ahead of the ARB airdrop – won't confirm or deny if a zkSync token is coming. Polygon, however, already has the MATIC token, which powers its older Polygon PoS blockchain.  ZkEVMs beyond zkSync and Polygon  Van Weert named three factors that can determine the success of a rollup: First, he says, the chain is “not tokenized yet.” Second, it begins “onboarding widely recognized protocols at a very early stage.” And third, “the developer experience should be very smooth.”  “Once there are good protocols, the users will follow,” van Weert said.  The zkEVM race doesn’t end with zkSync and Polygon. The Ethereum research and development firm ConsenSys is building a zkEVM, as are a handful of other startups. If any is to attract the users needed to compete with Arbitrum and Optimism, it will need to add blue-chip decentralized finance apps like Uniswap (which has committed to deploying on Polygon zkEVM) and Aave (which seems poised to launch on zkSync).  One yet-to-tokenize, yet-to-launch zkEVM protocol to keep an eye on, according to van Weert, is the zkEVM startup Scroll – which has yet to deploy on Ethereum’s main network but has partnered with some big-name protocols. “They already have a very mature ecosystem on their testnet, whereas on zkSync it is lacking. I mean, the capital is there, but a lot of people are sort of sidelined on zkSync because they have already bridged their funds over, but there isn't enough to play around with right now.”",POSITIVE,ETH | MATIC | ARB,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MATIC | ARB | AIRDROP,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/04/26/how-the-hunt-for-yet-to-exist-tokens-is-shaping-ethereums-layer-2-landscape,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d839ce61082a1bcd74e80e39f6ad91dde8cab187-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The new bill includes measures on stablecoins, proof-of-work mining and staking, and it could become “among the most advanced pieces of digital-asset legislation in the world,” Christina Rolle, executive director of the Bahamas' regulator, said in the statement.  The Bahamas, which passed crypto legislation formally called the Digital Assets and Registered Exchanges Act in 2020, was home to Sam Bankman-Fried and his crypto exchange FTX, which fell apart last November.  Since then, Bankman-Fried has been accused of siphoning off corporate funds to spend on luxury villas in the Bahamas. He pleaded not guilty to fraud charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice. FTX’s new management has blasted poor governance under his tenure, and is also involved in a protracted legal dispute with the Bahamas over jurisdiction.  Under the new bill, “operators of a digital-asset exchange must ensure the systems and controls used in its activities are adequate and appropriate for the scale and nature of its business,” the Securities Commission of the Bahamas said.  It will also bring in a “new and comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins” whose value is pegged to the U.S. dollar or another stable asset, after the collapse of Terra's terraUSD stablecoin last year. The bill also covers crypto services such as advice, derivatives and staking and includes oversight of non-fungible tokens.

Bitcoin was last at that level April 20, TradingView data show.  Shares of First Republic Bank (FRC) tumbled 50% on Tuesday after the San Francisco-based lender revealed a dramatic slump in deposits. Investors withdrew over $100 billion from the bank this quarter, prompting concerns it will become the third bank to fail, joining Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.  The slide stressed U.S. markets, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 1% and tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 dropping almost 2%. In contrast, bitcoin's price has added 6.4% in the past 24 hours, following safe-haven assets such as gold, to reverse nearly all losses from last week's sell-off.  Overall crypto market capitalization grew by 4.9%, with the likes of Cardano's ADA and Solana's SOL tokens jumping more than 7% to lead gains among major tokens.  Some observers reasoned the rally came from expectations of a liquidity injection by the Fed in a bid to protect its capital markets.  ""With First Republic Bank looking like it could go under, I suspect the market is anticipating yet more liquidity injections to prop up what certainly seems to be an American banking sector that is still very much in the throes of crisis,"" Jake Boyle, a director of retail crypto brokerage Caleb & Brown, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  ""Bitcoin, as a result, is front-running these expectations. Cracks in the financial system are growing, even if relatively subtly at the moment, and it’s going to be incredibly difficult for the Fed to adhere to its tightening regime going forward,” he said.

On Tuesday, options tied to ether and bitcoin signaled a bias for puts, or bearish bets that offer the purchaser protection against price slides. However, the demand for puts in the ether market was stronger than in the bitcoin market.  While ether's one-month bearish out-of-the-money (OTM) puts traded at a five volatility points premium to bullish OTM calls, bitcoin's OTM puts traded at a three-point premium to calls, according to options 25-delta risk reversal data tracked by crypto derivatives analytics firm Block Scholes.  ""ETH's [risk reversal] skew has now reversed its post-Shapella recovery relative to BTC options, now pricing OTM puts at a 5 vol premium to calls at a 1-month tenor,"" Andrew Melville, research analyst at Block Scholes, wrote in a research note on Tuesday.  ""This suggests a return to the slightly more negative sentiment assigned to ETH that we have commented on throughout this year,"" Melville added.  Implied volatility refers to investors' expectations for price turbulence over a specific period. An increase in IV represents an uptick in demand for options and lifts options premiums.  Risk reversals track the spread between implied volatility for OTM puts and calls, telling observers in which direction market volatility is more likely. An option is OTM when the underlying asset's market price is below the set price (strike price), in the case of bullish calls, or above the set price, in the case of bearish puts.  Barring the post-Shapella week, ether's one-month risk reversal has consistently hovered below bitcoin's risk reversal, signaling a relative stronger bias for puts.  Risk reversals in both markets had recovered to almost zero from negative, signaling a bearish-to-neutral shift in sentiment after the Shapella hard fork went live on April 12.  The upgrade opened withdrawals of staked ether, de-risking the popular passive investing strategy of depositing coins in the network in return for rewards.

12111672,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=528633,1682499939,"Solana Faces A Trend Decision, But The Bull Case Prevails","The price of Solana is facing an extremely important trend decision in the 1-day chart. Will the uptrend continue or will it be invalidated? The latter could threaten a drop to the psychologically important $20 level. A look at the 1-day chart shows that SOL failed in several attempts at the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (blue) in mid-April. The indicator has an extremely high significance for the long-term trend. While Bitcoin and numerous altcoins are already trading above the 200-day EMA, SOL is still stuck below the trend indicator as a consequence of the FTX crash. After falling below the 50-day EMA (orange) on Friday, the SOL price has fought its way back above the level today. Still, the price is at a key support, an ascending trendline (black) that has proven directional since the December 28, 2022 low at $7.98. A retracement could wipe out the uptrend and trigger another drop to $20. On the other hand, a break above the 200-day EMA currently at $25.13 could turn the chart picture in favor of the bulls. SOL Bull Case Prevails Solana rose to $25.96 in mid-April, but could not sustain the breakout above the 200-day EMA. In order to start a new attempt towards the north, Solana must break above $22.78 on a daily closing basis. If a stabilization above this resistance level succeeds, the buy side could again target the 200-day EMA. Only when this major trend line is broken dynamically, the yearly high at $27.13 comes into focus, where the 38.2% Fibonacci level is also located. If the Bitcoin price also rises to a new high for the year at this point, the SOL price could shoot straight up to the $30.44 resistance level. However, Solana is likely to make a stop here. The next target area after a consolidation would then be the 50% Fibonacci level at around $33. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Rebounding After A Major Drop, Will It Recover Previous Losses? In a bearish scenario, Solana falls below the black uptrend line and then also breaks the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement at $19.39 on the daily close. In this case, Solana is likely to trend towards the March 10 low near $16. Bullish News From Solana Ecosystem Fundamentals also point to a bull case for Solana. Just recently, the Helium (HNT) Network migrated to Solana. In early April, the Render Token (RNDR) community voted to migrate to the high-speed blockchain.

If the price of DOGE hovers around the $0.745 per token level, more than 30 billion tokens will be on the verge of losing their positions. Startling new data from crypto intelligence portal IntoTheBlock reveals that more than 100,000 Dogecoin addresses are now in a precarious situation. Will DOGE holders weather the storm or face a potential market crash? Related Reading: Will AVAX Price Get A Lift From Avalanche NFTs? Let’s Examine The Metrics Dogecoin Price Fluctuation: Meme Coin’s Market Movement Dogecoin’s current value on CoinMarketCap is $0.08028, reflecting a 24-hour increase of 1.98%. However, in the past week, the popular cryptocurrency has experienced a substantial decrease of 14%. Investors and traders are keeping a close eye on the market to determine whether this trend will persist or if Dogecoin will see a reversal in fortune. In a report, citing data by IntoTheBlock, some 37.2 billion DOGE were purchased in the $0.745 to $0.786 range, representing the largest of the pack near the current Dogecoin price. The data suggests that this number represents nearly 50% of all Dogecoin purchases currently in profit, with a value of $74.38 billion DOGE. As a result of the decline that began last Wednesday, approximately 40 billion Dogecoin has lost value compared to its initial purchase price. This volume is dispersed across over 594,000 addresses. Exploring The Technicalities Of DOGE Profitability The profitability of a cryptocurrency depends on the price at which an investor buys and sells the asset. When the buying price is lower than the selling price, the investor earns a profit. However, if the selling price is lower than the buying price, the investor incurs a loss. In the case of Dogecoin, if its price drops to a certain level, approximately 34 billion DOGE will become unprofitable, meaning that investors who purchased at higher prices will experience a loss. The price level at which this will occur is not set in stone and may vary based on various factors such as market sentiment, supply and demand dynamics, and other macroeconomic factors. DOGE total market cap currently at $11.1 billion on the daily chart at TradingView.com Related Reading: Total Ethereum (ETH) Locked Hits New Highs On Increase In Deposits Over Withdrawals The unprofitable DOGE can lead to an increase in sell-offs, and as a result, the price could spiral downwards. This can have a domino effect on the market, causing other cryptocurrencies to also experience a decline in value. Therefore, it is crucial for investors to monitor the market closely and make informed decisions based on the current market situation. As a result, investors need to be vigilant and take the necessary precautions to mitigate potential losses. (The information provided here is for educational and informational purposes only.

42420716,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqd7F,1682496000,Ethereum's Lifetime Energy Use Before the Merge Equaled Switzerland's for a Year,"Ethereum’s energy consumption from the blockchain's inception in 2015 until it moved to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism late last year is about equal to that used by all of Switzerland in just a year, according to the University of Cambridge’s Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF).  The CCAF, known for estimating the Bitcoin network’s energy consumption over the past several years, says Ethereum’s consumption totaled 58.26 Terawatt hours (TWh) between 2015 and the so-called Merge. Switzerland’s annual electricity consumption is 54.88 TWh, while Bitcoin’s is 143.9 TWh, according to the CCAF.  It’s not just Bitcoin network's energy consumption that’s a worry for the environmentally conscious. For example, artists exploring the craze for non-fungible token (NFT)-based collectibles have expressed their concern over the amount of power needed to mint works on Ethereum.  To this end, CCAF has cast its net wider and released the Cambridge Blockchain Network Sustainability Index (CBNSI), and with it an in-depth study of Ethereum’s electricity use from a contemporary and historical perspective.  The move to PoS reduced Ethereum’s consumption by over 99%. To illustrate the impact of the change, CCAF provided a comparison with the height of some well-known edifices.  If, for example, Bitcoin’s energy use is represented by Kuala Lumpur's Merdeka building, the second-highest in the world at some 678.9 meters (2230 feet), Ethereum’s previous proof-of-work (PoW) mining consensus system would stand at the comparable height of the London Eye, a 135 meter-high observation wheel. As a PoS power consumer, Ethereum has shrunk to the size of a raspberry, according to CCAF.  Being a not-for-profit institute, the CCAF aims to provide public value, hence the creative approach to illustrating energy use, explained Alexander Neumüller, CCAF research lead for digital assets and energy consumption.  “If I go out on the street now and ask, 'Hey, what is 100 terawatt hours? What is six gigawatt hours?' people don't know,” said Neumüller in an interview with CoinDesk. “So we have tried to contextualized it in the form of pictures, specifically with the buildings and, of course, the raspberry. This makes these magnitudes very clear without an understanding of energy notations.”  While Ethereum’s energy consumption is now orders of magnitude smaller than Bitcoin’s, CCAF is careful not to take a view on which algorithm might be better or worse, said Neumüller. He told CoinDesk that, in his opinion, proof-of-stake is not a perfect substitute for proof-of-work, and that a lot of additional factors come into play.  “When you talk about PoW, for instance, it is very hard to attack the network, even if you have extensive financial resources, because you actually need to buy and employ hardware as well as get access to energy,” he said. “PoS is really more financial based. So if your main objective was to disrupt the network, it would just be a case of acquiring the native tokens.”  CCAF estimates Ethereum will consume 6.56 GWh of electricity annually. To put that into perspective, the annual electricity consumption of the Eiffel Tower is 6.70 GWh, while keeping the lights on for a year at the British Museum requires 14.48 GWh.  Providing an estimate of Ethereum’s historical energy footprint is useful for projects that may want to start offsetting that debt, which happens to be a post-Merge project underway at ConsenSys. This offsetting process is being addressed by a group of Web3 firms now called the Ethereum Climate Platform.  “We decided to look back at the seven years of proof of work Ethereum,” said ConsenSys head of partnerships Steven Haft in an interview. “We looked at our so-called historic carbon debt to see what we could do to clean up our record of emissions over these over these past years.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | MINING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/04/26/ethereums-lifetime-energy-use-before-the-merge-equaled-switzerlands-for-a-year,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ea655ef6e9a465ec9c05d72d8c953a122160feb8-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Wahi has a sentencing hearing on May 9 in New York after he pleaded guilty to one of the first insider-trading cases concerning crypto trading.  “The Defendant respectfully submits that a sentence of no more than 10 months incarceration, together with several other consequences of Ishan’s conviction, would impose a sufficient, but not excessive, punishment for the crimes of conviction,” said the filing.  The case has drawn significant media attention, and Coinbase itself has intervened in a related case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission, arguing that the digital assets listed were not, in fact, securities.  The Tuesday filing cites that significant public attention and Wahi’s previous “modest, law-abiding and admirable life” and mental health conditions as reasons for leniency.  ""Ishan is a man of outstanding character who crossed the line,"" the document said. ""His promising career has ended instantly, with no realistic prospects of similar employment in the future.""  On Feb. 7, Wahi pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud by sharing details of future Coinbase crypto token listings with his brother Nikhil and another contact, Sameer Ramani, in a case heard by Judge Loretta Preska in the Southern District Court of New York.  A plea deal entered by Ishan Wahi and the U.S. government in February suggested a sentence of three to four years in jail, with a fine in the range $15,000-$150,000.

Exploiters drained some $850,000 worth of USD coin (USDC) from Merlin along with some more relatively illiquid tokens. As such, blockchain data suggested that an entity with control of the liquidity pool was able to drain the funds easily – meaning this was not a complex or sophisticated exploit.  The attack occurred despite Merlin touting an audit conducted by blockchain security firm CertiK. “No Critical Findings,” the audit concluded, as CertiK’s website data shows.  Merlin was offering its MAGE tokens in a public sale to investors in a three-day event without any hard cap. “$MAGE will begin trading at $45, with a $850K market value. The total amount raised will determine the final price of tokens for all users,” developers said Tuesday.  Merlin developers did not issue any statement regarding the funds drain on Wednesday at press time.

After five days lingering below $28,000, bitcoin (BTC) went for a surprising ride upward and took much of the rest of the market with it.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading above $28,300, up about 3.7% over the past 24 hours. The origins of the surge were difficult to pinpoint. BTC began ticking upward less than 24 hours after embattled First Republic Bank noted that it had lost $100 billion in deposits during its first quarter earnings presentation on Monday, reviving concerns about the banking sector's stability. Last month, cryptos rose amid a rash of U.S. regional banking implosions as investors sought refuge in assets that hold their value.  ""With First Republic Bank looking like it could go under, I suspect the market is anticipating yet more liquidity injections to prop up what certainly seems to be an American banking sector that is still very much in the throes of crisis,"" Jake Boyle, director of Caleb & Brown, a retail crypto brokerage, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. ""Bitcoin, as a result, is front-running these expectations. Cracks in the financial system are growing, even if relatively subtly at the moment, and it’s going to be incredibly difficult for the [Federal Reserve] to adhere to its tightening regime going forward.""  Boyle added: ""Bitcoin’s rally of late has more to do with liquidity injections and rising expectations that the Fed’s tightening will probably have to end fairly soon, or else even greater turbulence in the banking sector could ensue.”  Data from analytics firm Coinglass also showed that some $11.3 million of BTC short positions had been liquidated since 4 p.m. ET. Short squeezes have historically tended to accelerate price jumps.  Ether (ETH) was recently changing hands at about $1,870, up 1.8% from Monday, same time. Other major cryptos were largely in the green, with SOL, the native token of the Solana blockchain, and ADA, the native crypto of the Cardano smart contracts platform, both recently rising more than 3%. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of the crypto market's overall performance was up 2.6%.  In early Asia trading, the Nikkei and Hang Seng indexes were down slightly. U.S. stocks closed down with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite off nearly 2%.  In his weekday column, CoinDesk analyst Glenn Williams highlighted that at least two technical indicators were foreshadowing a bitcoin rebound. Williams noted that BTC's ""recent decline accompanied an expected drop in momentum, but it also occurred in conjunction with a move towards the lower end of the Bollinger Band. Bollinger Bands plot an asset’s 20-day moving average, and calculate two standard deviations above and below the average. An asset’s price is expected to stay within two standard deviations of the average 98% of the time, so a breach above or below is noteworthy.  Williams wrote that ""bitcoin approaching the lower range of its Bollinger Bands raises questions about its near-term path, but he added that ""given recent history, technical analysts could expect BTC prices to advance, albeit methodically, back to their 20-day average.""

Insights  What to Expect at Consensus  Crypto is down but not out. The industry that took a beating last year is set to make its first major public showing of 2023 at Consensus, CoinDesk’s annual conference. Many of the biggest names in crypto, government, Web3 and more will be in Austin, Texas, this week to discuss the current state of the industry, the devastating year it just had and what the future may hold.  On that score, things are looking up. If the first four months of the year are any indication of where the industry is heading, the rebuilding has begun.  In the U.S., regulatory uncertainty has given way to the certainty that crypto will be regulated. The European Union has provided the model, with the landmark omnibus MiCA regulations being voted into law last week. Even China, which banned crypto officially in 2019, seems to be warming to Web3.  Still, there’s much more building, policymaking, educating and, yes, investing to be done. While recent markets have given some reason for optimism, fraud and contagion have absolutely smashed consumer confidence in the industry. Regaining that trust will be difficult, but that is the opportunity at the feet of today’s builders, regulators and decision makers – many of whom will share their views at Consensus.  Here’s what to expect this week in Austin.

42420724,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqdDR,1682467852,NY Fed Policy Change Could Squash Stablecoin Issuer Circle’s Hope for Fed Access,"The Federal Reserve Bank of New York (N.Y. Fed) has curbed its counterparty criteria for its reverse-repurchase program (RRP) Wednesday in a way that could prevent stablecoin issuer Circle from accessing the prized Fed facility.  According to a press release by the N.Y. Fed, funds “organized for a single beneficial owner,” registered as “2a-7 funds” at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), “generally will be deemed ineligible” under the new rules. The Circle Reserve Fund, managed by global investment management giant BlackRock Advisors, appears to fall into this category.  The RRP lets selected counterparties – money-market funds, banks – lend overnight to the Fed at a fixed rate, currently at 4.8%. While the facility was originally created as a stabilization tool for the financial system, it has become a highly attractive vehicle to earn high yield with minimal counterparty risk. Currently, funds in the program reach almost $2.3 trillion.  Circle’s USDC stablecoin gaining access to the RRP would create “a stablecoin effectively backed by the Fed” and could potentially destabilize the financial system, the Bank Policy Institute, an important advocacy group for U.S. banks, said in January.  “The Fed updated the eligibility rules for the ONRRP facility in ways that could deny access to stablecoins,” Nick Timiraos, chief economic correspondent of The Wall Street Journal, tweeted.  Circle representatives did not immediately respond to a CoinDesk request for comment.  Circle, issuer of the $31 billion USDC stablecoin, keeps some $25 billion of the reserves in short-term U.S. Treasury bills in a bespoke BlackRock-managed fund called the Circle Reserve Fund. The Circle Reserve Fund is only available to Circle and was registered as a “2a-7” government money-market fund, according to Circle’s earlier press release and a SEC filing about the fund.  Circle’s goal for the fund was to gain access via BlackRock to the Fed’s RRP, Circle chief financial officer Jeremy Fox-Geen said in an interview with CoinDesk in November. This access would open the way to move USDC’s remaining cash reserves from partner banks to the fund under a Fed account, Fox-Geen added.  Last month, USDC weathered a crisis and temporarily depegged when it suffered from the sudden collapse of its banking partner Silicon Valley Bank. Some $3.3 billion of USDC’s cash reserve held at SVB remained inaccessible for days, sending shockwaves throughout the stablecoin market, until the government bailed out depositors holding in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s deposit insurance limit. Circle took steps “to reduce risk from the banking system” and now holds its cash reserves primarily at BNY Mellon, a global systemically important bank, the firm said.  The calamity caused more than $10 billion in outflows from USDC and demonstrated how exposed fiat-backed stablecoins are to risks in the traditional banking system.",NEGATIVE,USDC,EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | SPONSORED | USDC,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/04/26/ny-fed-policy-change-could-squash-stablecoin-issuer-circles-hope-for-fed-access,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f6131d1514745a0b912d0c4ce658292a3433ed27-2111x1188.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
