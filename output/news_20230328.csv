42412503,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl565q,1680041220,FDIC Gives Deadline of Next Week for Crypto Depositors Stranded by Signature Failure,"The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) is trying to hurry the stranded crypto customers out the door of the temporary entity that holds the assets of the former Signature Bank, asking them to cash out by next week – whether they have a new bank or not.  The deal in which the FDIC sold what remained of Signature to New York Community Bancorp didn’t include some $4 billion in crypto-related deposits, nor the bank’s Signet real-time transactions platform. The U.S. banking regulator is still trying to sell Signet, an agency spokesperson said, and is aiming to get the deposits cleared by April 5.  The FDIC has been reaching out to customers connected to the money, encouraging them to find another bank to transfer the funds. If they can’t, they’ll be getting a check to whatever address is on record for the customer, the spokesperson said.  Questions swirled around the stranded crypto clientele, such as whether expectations from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) kept the digital-assets customers out of the Signature purchase deal to NYCB’s Flagstar Bank subsidiary. The FDIC has denied any deliberate effort to segregate the funds. But whether or not the regulators intervened, the OCC’s strict standards for crypto involvement at the banks it oversees does make it difficult for its regulated institutions to bring on new business tied to the sector.  The resistance from U.S. regulators – also including the Federal Reserve – has made banks increasingly shy about their crypto involvement. Even Signature – which FDIC Chair Martin Gruenberg told senators this week “focused a significant portion of its business model on the digital asset industry” – had been pulling away from that business before it collapsed. So uncertainty remains about how easy it will be for its former customers to find new lenders to take their business in the next week.  The government’s rescue of Signature’s depositors – including the uninsured deposits typical of crypto clients – is expected to cost the FDIC’s insurance fund $2.5 billion, and Gruenberg said Signature’s former management is under investigation for its conduct that may have contributed to the failure.

42412509,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl569a,1680040221,Canada to Ask Pension Funds to Disclose Crypto Exposure,"Canada's national government said federally regulated pension funds in the country will need to disclose their crypto assets exposure to the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI), as Ottawa tightens its regulatory oversight on the volatile industry.  ""To help protect Canadians’ retirements, Budget 2023 announces that the government will require federally regulated pension funds to disclose their crypto-asset exposures to OSFI,"" the government said in the new 2023 budget plan. The federal government will also work with provinces and territories to discuss crypto-asset or related activities disclosures by the country's largest pension plans, which would ensure Canadians are aware of their pension plan’s potential exposure to crypto assets, the budget plan added.  The move comes after several high-profile bankruptcies such as the FTX exchange and the recent collapse of crypto-friendly U.S. lenders Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank exposed the extreme volatility investors face in the industry.  Some of the pension funds in the country have already felt the burn of investing in crypto. Last year, Quebec-based pension fund Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec said that it wrote off a US$150 million bet on Celsius Network. Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, one of Canada's largest pension funds with nearly US$250 billion in assets under management (AUM), also last year said it would write down the entirety of its US$95 million investment in FTX.  The 2023 budget indicated that OSFI will consult with federally regulated financial institutions on guidelines for publicly disclosing their exposure to crypto-assets, to help protect ""Canadians’ savings and the security of our financial sector.""  ""To protect Canadians from the risks that come with crypto-assets, there is a clear need for different orders of government to take an active role in addressing consumer protection gaps and risks to our financial system,"" the budget said.

42412500,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5632,1680039417,NFT Collection Y00ts Makes Anticipated Move From Solana to Polygon,"Popular non-fungible token (NFT) project y00ts has started the migration process from its native Solana blockchain to the Polygon network.  The migration, which began on Tuesday, was officially announced in December after months of speculation. DeLabs, the Los Angeles-based startup behind y00ts and its sister project DeGods, received a $3 million grant from Polygon to facilitate the move. Meanwhile, DeGods will also migrate away from Solana and plans to bridge over to Ethereum.  Y00ts, which launched in September 2022, is using a cross-chain bridge to bring its 15,000-edition generative art collection to Polygon. Existing holders can begin the migration process by visiting the y00ts website and connecting their wallets.  In order to incentivize holders to migrate their NFTs over to Polygon, DeLabs is waiving network fees for the first 24 hours. The team is also offering y00ts holders a chance to win an Ordinals-based DeGods NFT that has been inscribed on the Bitcoin network. Staking will also be free and holders will receive $5 USDC per Y00t listed on NFT marketplace Magic Eden.  Holders who do not migrate their NFTs by April 3 will be subject to a 33.3% “Paper Hands Bridge Tax,” which will result in a fine payable by increased royalty fees.  The project’s leader, Rohun Vora, known as Frank, tweeted that the move does not come without risk.  ""I know that this is a risk. I don’t know what’s going to happen today, tomorrow or throughout the first few weeks. But I know we’re going to make it work,"" he wrote. ""The short-term might be out of our control, but the long-term is completely in our entire community’s control.""  Nearly 10,000 y00ts have already been moved over to Polygon, according to OpenSea. The floor price of the collection is currently hovering around 1.8 ETH, or about $3,200.  It's rare to see top NFT projects like y00ts and DeGods move their entire ecosystem from one blockchain to another. Vora told holders in a Twitter Space in December that a possible exploit of the bridge contract would be the biggest challenge.  The move hands another win to Polygon, which has continued to expand its partnerships with major brands including Starbucks (SBUX), Nike (NKE), Reddit, Instagram and DraftKings.

42412514,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl56EG,1680038403,Bitcoin Layer 2 Stacks' Token a Top Performer in March,"Stacks (STX), the native token of Stacks Network, has soared in March amid booming hype for Bitcoin Ordinals and growing total value locked (TVL) on the protocol. The project is also set to undergo an upgrade later this year to further speed and scalability.  Known for being the first token distributed through the first-ever U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) qualified token offering in 2019, STX has gained 23% in March, reaching $1.25, the token’s highest level since a year ago. Although the token's gains have slowed slightly toward the end of March, it is still up 350% over the last three months, bringing its valuation to $1.5 billion.  Looking at tokens with a market capitalization above $1 billion, STX is the second top-performing digital asset over the month of March, behind XRP, according to data from Messari.  Stacks is a Bitcoin layer 2 protocol for smart contracts that’s attempting to transform and extend Bitcoin’s functionality from its widely known role as an alternative payment system to a more versatile platform that is programmable.  The token began to climb last month amid market participants' growing interest in creating Bitcoin Ordinal non-fungible tokens (NFT). Stacks has a native functionality to mint NFTs, and users have minted 650,000 Bitcoin NFTs on the Stacks layer 2, according to Stacks co-founder Muneeb Ali.  Stacks Network’s TVL also spiked over the last few months, climbing from $8 million in February to $35 million in mid-March, according to data from DeFiLlama. It has since retreated to $25 million.  “The hype surrounding Stacks is definitely due to Ordinals but could be sustained if the devs stick around,” decentralized finance (DeFi) analyst Michael Nadeau said. “Bitcoin needs projects like this to sustain itself in the long run.”  The Stacks smart contract protocol has a ledger to store data outside of Bitcoin’s layer 1, enabling developers to build apps on the platform, similar to what they can do on Ethereum or Solana.  Stacks is aiming to make Bitcoin more programmable, a feature more associated with the other two blockchain platforms, which currently have the majority of DeFi activity.  Stacks’ Ali said in an interview with CoinDesk that the recent interest surrounding STX could partly stem from anticipation for Stacks’ upcoming Nakamoto upgrade later this year.  He said the release will give users access to full smart contracts on a layer 2 chain, enabling them to move bitcoin (BTC) in and out while their layer 2 transactions are secured by the Bitcoin layer 1 network.  Ali said that unlike Ethereum and Arbitrum, users can’t easily move BTC into the Stacks layer right now. This is the biggest bottleneck.  The update is set to increase the network’s liquidity and capacity.  Ali also explained that unlike a lot of blockchains that require high-power hardware to run nodes, Stacks allows users to run nodes on less-sophisticated hardware such as Raspberry Pi or normal laptops, making it more accessible for users. Unlike Solana or ICP, Stacks doesn’t require you to run nodes in data centers, which is the typical way to deploy nodes with high hardware requirements, according to Ali.  In a report, NorthRock Digital, a hedge fund that invests in cryptocurrencies, wrote that “despite limitations developing a crypto economy on top of Bitcoin, Stacks has a potentially 'massive opportunity' ... because of the relatively small crypto economy currently built on Bitcoin.  NorthRock identified three main layer 2 networks on Bitcoin: Lightning, RSK and Stacks. Each layer 2 “is complementary and has different goals, but of the three Stacks is furthest along in terms of developing an ecosystem for more traditional crypto applications (NFTs, DeFi, Name Services, etc.),” NorthRock wrote.  NorthRock also noted that Bitcoin’s upcoming halving will likely benefit Stacks. “The halving itself will decrease Bitcoin’s security budget and further reinforce the need to develop a larger fee pool through a more productive Bitcoin ecosystem. This will solidify the importance” of layer 2s like Stacks, the report said.",POSITIVE,BTC | STX,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | STX | TOKEN SALE,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/28/bitcoin-layer-2-stacks-token-a-top-performer-in-march,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/370a999c69f4efb35feeba3aa1690c0d016abc33-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Helped by bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) 1.3% rise to $27.34K and ethereum's ( ETH-USD ) gain to $1.78K, the global crypto market cap shot up 2.7% to $1.15T, according to CoinMarketCap data . XRP, meantime, was one of the biggest gainers among major tokens, perking up to a five-month high of $0.52. Aside from bullish price action experienced across the crypto market, XRP's rally came in the wake of the battle between crypto exchange Binance and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and what it means for Ripple and the coin. On Monday, the CFTC sued Binance and its CEO on allegations that it solicited U.S. users via unregistered crypto derivatives offerings, and directed its employees and customers to hide their true location by using VPNs to evade compliance controls. In the CFTC's complaint, the regulator branded bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), ethereum ( ETH-USD ) and other tokens as commodities. That's the main question of Ripple's long-running lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (i.e., whether XRP ( XRP-USD ) is a security or commodity). Ripple Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz argued that XRP ( XRP-USD ) should be referred to as a commodity, as it represents ""a raw good that trades in commerce and one XRP is treated as equivalent to every other XRP. That's pretty much the definition of a 'commodity,'"" he wrote in a Twitter post at the time. ""No part of XRP's value comes from anyone else's legal obligations to XRP holders.""

42393744,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpA107,1680035753,"Crypto’s Unfulfilled Dreams Get a Tailwind From U.S. Crackdown on Binance, Coinbase","A founding principle of this whole cryptocurrency experiment is to extol the benefits of decentralizing the financial system.  “Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled” network, Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s creator, wrote in 2008. “But pure P2P [peer-to-peer] networks … seem to be holding their own.”  And, yet, crypto got real centralized. Binance, Coinbase and – before it blew up – FTX grew to be giants of trading, creating a vulnerability if those companies ran into trouble. And they did. Binance and Coinbase face a U.S. regulatory crackdown. FTX famously crumbled last year amid fraud allegations.  There is another way, though, a path mostly known only to traders deeply embedded in the world of crypto: decentralized exchanges (DEX) such as dYdX or Uniswap. And while there are obstacles to more widespread adoption – they are far less user-friendly than centralized exchanges (CEX) like Binance, whose websites and apps closely resemble the brokerage software seen in traditional finance (TradFi) – the investigations into Binance and Coinbase could create a tailwind for these geekier, decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions.  Read more: What Is a DEX? How Decentralized Crypto Exchanges Work  “My best guess is this will further increase DeFi market share as protocols are harder to stop,” said Dave Weisberger, the CEO and co-founder of CoinRoutes. While it’s not impossible to go after DeFi protocols – the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission just subpoenaed the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) behind SushiSwap, another DEX – “protocols are harder to prosecute,” he added.  Howard Greenberg, president and co-founder of the American Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Association, also sees DeFi getting a tailwind, arguing the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s case announced this week against Binance – which was accused of breaking the law by allowing U.S. traders to access its offshore exchange – “may push traders to decentralized alternatives.”  Shortly after the news of the U.S. regulator lawsuit against Binance, users withdrew $400 million on the Ethereum blockchain, according to blockchain analytics firm Nansen. This is compared to a net outflow of $2 billion over the past seven days.  Up until recently, centralized crypto exchanges have been the primary choice for traders looking to buy and sell bitcoin (BTC) and the like. For retail traders, that’s because CEXs can be less intimidating than the apps that serve DeFi. For pros and institutional investors, there’s historically been more liquidity on CEXs, an appealing quality.  Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world, has a daily trading volume of about $9.3 billion. In comparison, dYdX, the largest DEX, trades around $770 million worth of crypto in a day.  DEXs are intrinsically more transparent than CEXs, given that the former completes trades publicly on a blockchain. CEXs conventionally do not, in part because blockchains simply cannot process transactions fast enough. But blockchains are getting faster. Ironically, DEXs could make regulators’ job easier.  Read more: Arbitrum Surges Ahead as Ethereum’s Layer 2 Landscape Takes Shape  “CEXs being complete black boxes, which almost always creates the uneasy perception of misaligned interests, makes the job of a regulator significantly harder,” said Berk Ozdogan, head of strategy at Dexalot.  “From a regulator's perspective, trading occurring on public blockchain DEXs means that the effort to prepare formal inquiries, the time needed to conclude the discussions and the trust that needs to be placed on the investigated CEX would no longer be needed since the activity would be readily available for review,” he added.  On DEXs, traders can buy or sell cryptocurrencies without an intermediary, which is typically the part that creates uncertainty because of the limited insight the public gets.  One of the complaints that regulators and even clients of large centralized exchanges have repeatedly expressed is the need for some type of financial audit, a document that proves the company is holding exactly the amount of assets it says it holds. The closest to an audit that most exchanges, such as Binance, have released so far is a proof-of-reserves document, but it can’t nearly be trusted as much.  Audits would be one step closer to the transparency requirements lawmakers are longing for but still far from the level of transparency that DEXs – where every move can be traced on the public blockchain – provide naturally.  “If we learned anything from 2022, particularly with FTX, it’s the fact that custodial relationships, especially in the face of lack of regulation, are very bad,” said Ozdogan. “Too many users have lost assets to bad actors and, in turn, the custodial nature of centralized exchanges. In the world of digital assets, one rule reigns supreme: Not your keys, not your crypto.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | TRADING | BNB,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/03/28/cryptos-unfulfilled-dreams-get-a-tailwind-from-us-crackdown-on-binance-coinbase,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/70dd9189fbaaf8c8f3da25410af6ed0ddc7b2678-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412536,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl57ym,1680035192,Ethereum Staking Provider Lido to Incorporate NFTs Into Unstaking Process,"Lido, the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol by total value locked, unveiled plans during its Node Operator Community Call #5 to release a non-fungible token (NFT) representing a user’s withdrawal request amount as part of the process of unstaking their ether (ETH). These withdrawals will be enabled after the Ethereum blockchain undergoes its next major upgrade, Shanghai (also referred to as Shapella by developers), next month.  Ether withdrawals on Lido, where users can unstake their stETH and receive ETH at a 1:1 ratio, will have two steps: request and claim, according to Mariya Muzyko, product manager at Lido, during the call Tuesday afternoon. Once a user requests a withdrawal, they will receive a Lido-issued NFT representing their withdrawal request. The user can then use the NFT to claim their ETH rewards. The NFT is burned after the user redeems and claims their ETH.  Lido was the first to provide access to liquidity to ETH holders who wanted to stake their tokens by issuing a derivative token, stETH. This token represents the combined value of the user’s initial deposit plus accrued interest and can be used across many DeFi platforms. The introduction of an NFT into the request withdrawal process represents another first of its kind.  Each withdrawal-request NFT will be transferable, which means users can transfer the NFT to another address, giving this new address the right to claim the corresponding ether rewards. If a user decides to sell their NFT on secondary markets, Lido said it will not take a royalty percentage from the sale.  Withdrawal periods will take roughly one to five days to process, depending on the amount of stETH in the withdrawal and the number of total requests, according to the community call.

42412530,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl57u6,1680033186,Bitcoin Seesaws Around $27K as Investors Digest Binance-CFTC Lawsuit,"Bitcoin (BTC) consolidated around $27,000 as investors continued to mull the potential impact of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) lawsuit against Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao over alleged regulatory violations including running an illegal exchange and a ""sham"" compliance program.  BTC was recently trading at about $27,225, up about 1% over the past 24 hours. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization dipped as low as $26,669 earlier in the day. BTC plunged from highs above $28,000 after the CFTC lawsuit was filed on Monday and has fallen 3% over the past week.  “Bitcoin is displaying such unbelievable resilience to what is happening around it, even in the crypto industry, that you have to wonder just how sustainable that can be,” Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in a Tuesday note. He added that the CFTC-Binance-triggered price drop “doesn't feel particularly significant.”  Investors are fretful about the potential impact of the CFTC suit against the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, and increasing regulatory scrutiny that threatens to place some of the same restrictions on the industry as on traditional finance.  Meanwhile, Binance and the CFTC sparred in the aftermath of the filing. In a late Monday blog post, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao called the lawsuit “an incomplete recitation of facts.” But in an appearance on CNBC on Tuesday, CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam said the CFTC action “seemed to be a pretty clear case of evasion and something that we needed to step in aggressively with and do it as quickly as possible.”  K33 Research’s research analysts also attributed the recent downside volatility to lingering effects of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) 25 basis point interest rate hike last week and software provider MicroStrategy’s announcement on Monday that it had bought roughly $150 million more in bitcoin over the past five weeks and pre-paid the remaining principle on a loan from failed, crypto-focused Silvergate Bank. BTC fell 2% in the immediate aftermath.  “The adverse market reaction after a MicroStrategy announcement is typical,” K33's research analysts wrote in a note sent to its client Tuesday. “Market participants absorb the information that a known large buyer has finished, meaning less buy-side liquidity to support further upside.”  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency in market value, was recently changing hands at about $1,772, a nearly 4% gain.

42411019,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ghvUX6,1680031733,"On-Chain Stablecoin, Profitability Ratios Signal Investor Caution","An on-chain measure of stablecoins versus bitcoin (BTC) held by exchanges indicates the appetite for the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization could be waning.  The Exchange Stablecoins Ratio (ESR), an indicator that divides bitcoin exchange reserves by the number of stablecoins on exchanges, has risen to its highest level since May 2021.  The CryptoQuant metric acts as a measure of buying power. When the ESR declines, the number of stablecoins on exchange is increasing relative to bitcoin reserves. When the ratio increases, the opposite is the case.  As stablecoins serve as a primary mechanism for purchasing crypto assets, a lower ratio equates to more buying power.  The recent increase in the ratio implies that investors are moving fewer stablecoins to exchanges and more bitcoin, or they are doing both simultaneously.  Both would indicate potential selling pressure as investors fret about the current investment environment following several U.S. bank failures and increased regulatory scrutiny of crypto. Investors often move crypto assets to exchanges for the purpose of selling. They move stablecoins to exchanges when bullish sentiment is increasing.  The timing of the relative decline in stablecoin supply coincides with a 34% increase in BTC's price since March 10, but that was largely before conditions worsened.  Theoretically, if investors felt that more gains were to be had following a price increase, the stablecoin volume to exchanges would increase.  The sharp increase in the ratio following bitcoin’s price increase implies investors at the very least have positioned themselves to take profits quickly, should an event cause the bitcoin’s price to drop suddenly.  An example of such an event was the Commodity Futures Trading Corporation (CFTC) lawsuit against Binance and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao. The filing was followed by a big BTC price drop in the ensuing hours.  BTC fell 2.84% on Monday, and is most recently down an additional 0.55%..  A second on-chain indicator is signaling investor caution as well. The Adjusted Spent Output Profit (aSOPR) ratio measures the extent to which bitcoin investors are selling at a profit or loss.  The metric indicates that investors are selling at a profit when its reading exceeds 1.0, and that investors are selling at a loss when it falls below 1.0.  The current reading of 1.0452 indicates the former. While selling an asset at a profit is generally viewed positively, taking profits in the middle of an increase in asset prices could signal concerns that the increase will stall.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/28/on-chain-stablecoin-profitability-ratios-signal-investor-caution,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/80efd1dca97fe12d03e180a6b0445dd4832a761f-6000x3376.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""I believe they are a commodity,” Behnam said. “And because they are listed on CFTC exchanges, we do have a regulatory relationship – obviously with the derivatives market and that product, but the underlying market as well.”  Behnam said that belief is driving the case against Binance, and against other institutions trading bitcoin and ether – suggesting such trading at other platforms may eventually face regulatory scrutiny, too.  Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, however, has argued that proof-of-stake tokens – which would include ether since the Ethereum blockchain's protocol switch last year – are probably securities that should be registered and regulated by his agency. But Gensler hasn’t yet set that in stone with enforcement actions or court wins.  Crypto insiders once viewed Behman and the CFTC as friendlier toward the sector than the SEC and its chairman but the CFTC has authored a number of enforcement actions against crypto companies. The Binance case – targeting the largest crypto platform by trading volume in the world – could have even wider implications.  Behnam was asked by lawmakers Tuesday whether he still hopes to allow space for crypto innovation in the U.S., as he’s stated before.  ""It should be absolutely a concern,” he said. “Europe has put in place a pretty comprehensive regime that's going to be implemented over the next couple of years,"" he said, adding that the U.S. needs to ""move the ball forward.""  ""We don't want to rush,” he said, saying the effort should be “cautious and deliberate.”",NEUTRAL,ETH,COMMODITY | ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING | BNB,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/28/us-cftc-chief-behnam-reinforces-view-of-ether-as-commodity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/606e49309dee05c5fbb6ec7119c383ea12b6d29a-5798x3261.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

With Mega Matrix, Bit Digital hopes to get exposure to an institutional-grade ETH staking protocol. I have doubts about this. Bit Digital has also invested in Auros Global, a market maker and crypto derivatives business. I think this deal will bear much more fruit. It's been a busy month of announcements for Bit Digital (BTBT). In March alone, the company has announced investments in a derivatives protocol, a staking platform, and a change in leadership. I'll share some general thoughts on the partnership-specific developments in a moment and take a stab at how I think the company likely views potential synergies between its core Bitcoin (BTC-USD) mining business and the two entities that it will now be working closely with. First though, last week Bit Digital announced CEO Bryan Bullett would be finished in the role at the end of the month: Effective March 31, 2023, Bryan Bullett, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, will conclude his term as CEO. Mr. Bullett will assume the role Senior Advisor, in which he will lead strategic growth initiatives for the Company. Sam Tabar, the Company's Chief Strategy Officer, will be appointed CEO. Bullett is to be replaced by Sam Tabar. Judging from the company's website and his presence at a Bitcoin conference earlier this month, it appears as though Tabar is already in the role and this announcement has been more of a formality than anything else. Mega Matrix: Intentions vs. Operations On March 7th, Bit Digital announced the launch of a staking joint venture with Mega Matrix Corp (MPU). Capitalizing on staking as an incremental revenue driver certainly makes sense given Bit Digital's focus on Ethereum (ETH-USD) staking, it's the choice to work with Mega Matrix that I find a bit bizarre. There isn't much detail about the deal from Bit Digital's press release aside from Bit Digital's 40% ownership in a new joint venture entity that will utilize ""MarsProtocol"" as a client-facing ETH staking solution: Through MarsProtocol, the Joint Venture will seek to provide non-custodial staking tools whereby users' private keys are not stored in its database to ensure the safety of its users' digital assets. Pursuant to the Agreement, Bit Digital will own 40% of the Joint Venture Company. Mega Matrix doesn't appear to have a viable business at the moment. The company had virtually no operating revenue from the prior 2 quarters, recently closed down a flopped GameFi project, and is running out of cash very quickly. Furthermore, MarsProtocol doesn't appear to be operational yet. I can't help but wonder why this is the company Bit Digital picked to build what appears to be a very basic front end application for ETH staking. And an application that doesn't appear to provide a liquid staking token for use in other DeFi activities or address the 32 ETH minimum requirement problem: MarsProtocol I can understand not offering pooled staking since the stated intention is for institutional clients who may not see the staking minimum as a hurdle, but I have a hard time believing a company with seemingly no expertise in Ethereum staking will be able to attract large institutional flows. What would make more sense would be if Bit Digital intends to use a staking protocol that it partially owns for ETH staking rather than paying a fee to a service provider run by a separate entity. But so far, that's purely speculation on my part. It would be a savvy move if that is indeed the goal, I'm just not sure Mega Matrix is the team to go with given the results of a recent security audit. The security audit of the MarsProtocol demo site by Certik raised three issues; two of which were considered ""major"" flaws that involved poor security configurations pertaining to password strength and unencrypted communications. While all of the findings from Certik's audit have apparently been resolved, it doesn't exactly give confidence that a staking protocol that utilizes cryptography didn't have encrypted communications or proper password strength parameters in place from the jump. Given the Mega Matrix pivot from a failed GameFi/NFT exchange business in November to an Ethereum staking platform now, it's unfortunate that we don't know how much capital Bit Digital poured into this joint venture because I'm not sure how much fruit this business will actually bear. It isn't all bad news though. Auros Global: Distressed Investment The other recent partnership announcement from Bit Digital this month is a strategic investment in Auros Global. Auros is a market maker and derivatives trading firm that ended up restructuring debt after having $20 million tied up in FTX (FTT-USD). Without any ability to access those funds, Auros couldn't pay back $18 million in Maple Finance DeFi loans. One of the company's creditors is M11 Credit. In February, M11 Credit wrote that an agreement had been reached with Auros that would see all of the outstanding loans paid back. According to M11 more than half of it already has been: 55% of the outstanding debt has been repaid already 40% of the outstanding debt was reissued for 9 months at 8.64% interest - spread over three 90 day cycles 5% of the outstanding debt was reissued for 90 days at 0% Auros' CEO is Benjamin Roth. In a recent interview with CoinDesk, Roth stated Auros Global accounted for roughly 1-2% of total crypto market trading volume and was a profitable business before the FTX collapse. For Bit Digital, this partnership seems to make a lot more sense to me. Tabar is quoted in a blog post from Auros and said this deal will allow Bit Digital to generate yield on digital assets and possibly even hedge pricing volatility from BTC production: Bit Digital's investment in Auros underscores our confidence in the firm's robust infrastructure and its ability to complement our core business. Through unique yield generation opportunities and bespoke hedging solutions, Auros is able to provide sophisticated support to Bit Digital whilst also working to bring much needed liquidity and market making capabilities to the industry. Unlike the Mega Matrix/MarsProtocol partnership, Auros Global is already an established business. But it is a business that was in the unfortunate position of being caught up in the FTX drama. Auros needed funding and probably didn't have too many options in an environment like the one we're currently in. Bit Digital has assets and potential synergies as a digital asset producer that may want to hedge pricing volatility from production and/or put assets to work in DeFi protocols. This deal makes considerably more sense to me. Summary I'm looking forward to both Bit Digital's March production update and the company's next earnings report. I've spent some time watching and listening to interviews featuring Sam Tabar and he seems to ""get it."" I like the Auros Global move quite a bit. Mega Matrix is a bit more of a head scratcher and I don't have high hopes for MarsProtocol but I'd love to be proven wrong. I still think there are a lot of risks in this name and it's not a company that I think crypto equity investors or traditional equity investors should get over-exposed to. But it is an interesting company that I believe warrants a speculative bet given the balance sheet health relative to peers and the ETH Staking strategy .

42412526,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl57rI,1680029237,Former CFTC Chairman: Regulator's Lawsuit Against Binance 'Is a Big Deal',"The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) lawsuit against Binance, the largest crypto exchange by trading volume, is, in Timothy Massad’s words, a “big deal.”  ""If you read the complaint, there is so much detail to it. It suggests that [CFTC] did have some information from people inside,” said the regulator's former chairman, now a research fellow at Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government. He told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Tuesday the level of detail is “really quite striking.”  The CFTC, which is responsible for regulating the U.S. derivatives markets, filed a lawsuit Monday against Binance and its founder, CEO Changpeng Zhao, for allegedly offering unregistered derivatives products and helping U.S.-based customers sidestep compliance controls via the use of virtual private networks (VPN).  “This complaint basically says that Binance and Zhao himself deliberately and systematically cultivated U.S. business, helped U.S. persons get around those restrictions and even did things internally to try to hide how much U.S. business they were doing,” said Massad, also director of the Digital Assets Policy Project.  In a blog post response, Zhao said the complaint “appears to contain an incomplete recitation of fact,” adding that the exchange does not agree ”with the characterization of many of the issues alleged in the complaint.”  Will the CFTC’s lawsuit against Binance finally prompt congressional lawmakers to enact legislation for regulating the crypto industry in the U.S.? Massad said it is unlikely.  “I don’t see the movement toward a consensus on that in Congress,” said Massad, who led the CFTC for nearly three years during the Obama administration.  ""I think there's really quite a variety of views from those who are very skeptical about crypto and don't want to pass a law that they feel would legitimize it too much, and those who ... believe in the innovative potential and would like to see greater regulatory clarity and perhaps rules that allow for more innovation,"" he said.  Meanwhile, the agency’s filing against Binance will take some time to litigate, he said. At least for the moment, “we’ll just have to watch these enforcement actions play out.”  Read more: CFTC Sues Binance, CEO Zhao Over 'Willful Evasion' of U.S. Laws, Unregistered Crypto Derivatives Products",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | BNB,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/28/former-cftc-chairman-regulators-lawsuit-against-binance-is-a-big-deal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cff2ec724e64423f80526812a67b83e02f096aea-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421291,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXno9V,1680025108,Why Bitcoin Is Your Best Bet Against Inflation,"Last week, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 0.25% amid banking turmoil, marking the ninth increase in a year and placing rates between 4.75% and 5%. The Fed aimed to balance fighting inflation while addressing banking sector upheaval, which already had a “tightening” effect on the economy.  The decision was heavily scrutinized by investors and economists for potentially prolonging economic turmoil. Chair Jerome Powell said strong economic data justified the hike, but acknowledged tighter credit conditions could further negatively impact households, businesses and the economy.  Tatiana Koffman is an angel investor, author and creator of the weekly newsletter MythOfMoney.com, where a version of this piece published first.  Fed officials still anticipate slower growth and higher inflation, with interest rates peaking at 5.1% in 2023 before dropping to 4.3% in 2024. Further, Powell reassured the public of the banking system's resilience, with the Fed ready to deploy all necessary tools to ensure its stability, but critics weren’t convinced.  And so, the most important question remains – will these measures be effective in actually reversing inflation back to the target rate of 2%?  We do have a relatively recent historical example of the Federal Reserve successfully reversing inflation in the 1980s, but it was a bumpy road. The renowned central banker Paul Volcker is widely hailed as one of the “greatest of all time” heads of the Federal Reserve for his role in combating inflation in the early 1980s.  See also: Bitcoin Was Built for This Moment | Opinion  However, one often-overlooked policy mistake made by the Volcker Fed in 1980 resulted in a more protracted period of high inflation and necessitated even tighter monetary policy. This ultimately led to the most severe U.S. recession since World War II up to that point.  By the time Volcker assumed his position as chair of the Fed in July 1979, the central bank's credibility on inflation had been severely undermined by the flawed policies of his predecessors, Arthur Burns and G. William Miller. Inflation had soared to over 12% by October 1979. In a surprise press conference on Oct. 6, 1979, Volcker announced that the Fed would allow the benchmark federal funds rate to ""fluctuate over a wider range,"" resulting in an increase to over 17% by April 1980.  Facing mounting pressure to roll back rate hikes, including protests by farmers and car dealers along with bipartisan political intervention, the Federal Reserve yielded. As unemployment exceeded 7% in May, the Fed chose to substantially lower the federal funds rate, even though inflation had reached a staggering 14.7% in April. This move tarnished Volcker's reputation as a champion against inflation, and throughout the remainder of 1980, inflation persisted at over 12%.  As the recession concluded in July 1980, the Federal Reserve resumed its battle against inflation and began raising the federal funds rate once more. To reassert its credibility, the Fed had to push the rate to a staggering level of nearly 20% by mid-1981. Demonstrating unwavering resolve, Volcker wielded a metaphorical baseball bat to subdue the economy and vanquish inflation. The subsequent recession, commencing in July 1981, was the most severe economic downturn of the century.  Numerous analysts and economists now hold the belief that to effectively curb inflation, the federal funds rate must exceed the rate of inflation for a sustained period. Presently, inflation hovers around 6% (as of February 2023), while the federal funds rate range stands between 4.75% and 5%. Consequently, further interest rate increases are likely on the horizon.  But what happens if the inflation fight is prolonged as it was in 1980? How do we protect ourselves from the value of our assets eroding away?  This particular concern is back on everyone’s mind due to the current instability of the American banking system. The U.S. Treasury Department and the Fed have indicated that they will “back-stop” customer deposits for regional banks where the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) fails to do so, which critics say could result in another “money-printing spree” leading to further inflation.  In 2020, when the government initiated money printing in response to COVID-19, Paul Tudor Jones, the American billionaire and hedge fund investor, penned a compelling investor letter, widely regarded as the rational case for hedging one's portfolio against inflation with bitcoin.  He provides a list of inflation hedges “a host of assets that at one time or another have worked well in reflationary periods,” ranging from the most obvious such as gold to more esoteric such as foreign exchange investments like the AUD/JPY (Japanese yen/Australian dollar) foreign exchange trading pair. His full list of nine hedges, some of which you can invest in and some of which are meant to inspire ideas, include:  Gold: a store of value with a 2,500-year history  The yield curve: Historically a great defense against stagflation or a central bank intent on inflating. For our purposes we use long two-year notes and short 30-year bonds  Nasdaq 100: The events of the last decade have shown that quantitative easing can rapidly leak into equity markets, giving stocks a boost  Bitcoin: The most established cryptocurrency  U.S. cyclicals (long)/U.S. defensive (short): A pure goods inflation play historically  AUD/JPY forex pair: Australia is a long commodity exporter while Japan is short commodity importer  TIPS (Treasury inflation-protected securities): Indexed to consumer price index (CPI) to protect against inflation  GSCI (Goldman Sachs commodity index): A basket of 24 commodities that reflects underlying global economic growth in the U.S.  JPMorgan’s emerging market currency index: Historically when global growth is high and inflationary pressures are building, emerging market currencies have done quite well, likely because they are also suffering from inflation  (The list was lightly edited.)  Tudor Jones then puts these nine candidates through a rigorous analysis using the following four categories:  Purchasing power: How does this asset retain its value over time?  Trustworthiness: How is it perceived through time and universally as a store of value?  Liquidity: How quickly can the asset be monetized into a transactional currency?  Portability: Can you geographically move this asset if you had to for an unforeseen reason?  His analysis leads him to identify bitcoin as the top candidate due to its ability to retain purchasing power (as the best-performing institutional asset of all time, from the perspective of bitcoin’s entire lifecycle), trustworthiness (backed by cryptography), liquidity (tradeable 24/7) and, most importantly, portability (as a peer-to-peer system, no entity can intermediate on-chain transactions).

During periods of political turmoil such as wars, pandemics or shifts in government, the importance of digital portability cannot be overstated. After all, it's improbable that anyone would transport gold or paper bonds across borders.

42421285,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXno4L,1680023616,How Bad Is the Binance Suit?,"Binance, the largest global crypto exchange by trading volume, and Chief Executive Changpeng Zhao were reportedly taken off guard by the U.S. Commodities and Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) decision to file a civil lawsuit against the company on Monday. The firm, which has for years avoided establishing a permanent headquarters, had been in dialogue with U.S. and other regulators about operating compliantly in the hundred-plus jurisdictions it services.  Just last month, Binance Chief Strategy Officer Patrick Hillman told the Wall Street Journal that the exchange had closed “gaps” that formed in its compliance strategy as a result of the exchange’s rapid expansion. At the time, Hillman more or less suggested Binance was prepared to eat flour for its previous crimes, committed unwillingly, but was also having substantive conversations with regulators that would allow it to continue existing.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The CFTC’s filing was a surprise, to an extent. There have been rumors the U.S. Department of Justice, Securities and Exchange Commission and even the Internal Revenue Service were preparing lawsuits for a range of corporate failings. When U.S. officials sanctioned Russian crypto exchange Bitzlato, they noted Binance was a large counterparty for darknet marketplaces. That the CFTC dropped the first shoe is surprising – if only because it fuels confusion over whether ether (ETH) and other cryptocurrencies are commodities or securities.  See also: Shuttered Crypto Exchange Bitzlato Says It Plans to Resume Operations  In its 74-page complaint, the CFTC, accused Binance of not only servicing U.S. customers without filing for the appropriate licenses but actively helping customers skirt know-your-customer and other compliance rules. Binance’s executives were allegedly aware its geofencing tools were inadequate, and even had a semi-formalized (though confidential) procedure for getting “whales” around it and shielding their U.S. IP addresses.  The case is obviously bad for Binance, and comes during an uncertain time for crypto. Experts say this could be a fatal blow to the exchange (worst case), or disrupt a significant part of its revenues (Bloomberg’s Matt Levine, for instance, essentially said the case is not centered on consumer safety, but designed to prevent Binance from profiting from U.S. hedge funds). CEO Zhao could be barred from running the firm he founded in 2017, and from trading crypto period.  If Zhao, who is thought to be one of the wealthiest people in the world, starts selling off assets, that could have a negative impact on crypto prices. And cutting Binance out of derivatives markets could have deleterious effects on bitcoin’s liquidity and price. If the BitMEX case filed by the CFTC in 2018 provides any insight into how things will play out, the toppling of the largest derivatives exchange sounds worse than it will ultimately be.  Instead, this is likely just another significant blow to crypto’s reputation. Evidence suggests there is at least one informant at Binance, who passed private communications and self-destructing Signal messages to the commodities watchdog. Those messages paint a portrait of Binance – with Zhao at the helm – as a business that would sacrifice rules for the sake of growth. Large traders were privileged with faster settlement connections and lower fees – putting them above retail investors. And, if the CFTC is to be believed, Binance traded against its customers, which seems to be a trend at crypto exchanges.  However, it’s important to note the claims made are just allegations. Too often (in and out of crypto) are the police taken at their word. U.S. regulators are likely not filing a lawsuit based on false evidence, but it is information with a slant. In the Bitzlato suit, U.S. regulators assumed without evidence the exchange’s lifetime transaction volumes were all from illicit sources. In the BitMEX suit, regulators suggested but did not prove the exchange facilitated transfers for terrorists.  See also: Binance Can't Keep Its Story Straight on Misplaced $1.8B USDC Funds | Opinion  Binance, as Hillman said, has made serious mistakes and has operated under a suspicious corporate and regulatory veil. But the worst accusations have not yet been proven, and may have explanations. The U.S. government has taken a hard line against crypto – seemingly coordinating efforts to cut crypto off from the wider economy through banking restrictions and punitive lawsuits – and so it should not be a surprise they would target an exchange that has seemed to weather and grow during the bear market.  Make no mistake, Binance’s apparent conflicts of interests and willingness to flaunt regulations is abhorrent. Zhao and other Binance executives’ internal communications regarding fraud and illicit activity on the exchange, disclosed in the court documents, are laughably inept.

42412515,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl57is,1680022918,UK Crypto Promotions Laws Hoped to Be in Place by Late 2023,"Crypto promotion legislation is on track to be in force by late this year, the U.K. Treasury said in a tweet on Tuesday.  A draft of the Financial Services and Markets Act amendment was published on Monday. It will enable the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to regulate crypto firms under the existing promotions law set out in the Financial Services and Markets Act (FSMA).  The rules are aimed at allowing the U.K. government to try and safeguard consumers from ""misleading crypto asset promotions,"" the Treasury said in a tweet.  The legislation also includes a limited time exemption for crypto companies that will allow those that are registered with the FCA the opportunity to approve their own ads as opposed to relying on others to do so. Some companies are authorized companies under FSMA, so can approve their own ads, but crypto companies do not fall under that umbrella.  An accompanying document to this measure estimated that if third parties were approving crypto ads, it would cost firms between 5,000 to 15,000 British pounds (US$6,168 to $18,504) to win acceptance depending on the ""complexity of materials.""

The move also came after Binance ended zero-fee trading for BUSD-listed trading pairs a week ago, only to eliminate trading fees just for trueUSD-listed pairs. Although that figure is notable, it's well below the $2B in outflows experienced last month when regulators took aim at Paxos, the issuer of BUSD ( BNB-USD ), the article said. Despite the tumult, BUSD ( BNB-USD ) has kept its peg to the U.S. dollar. The CFTC sued Binance and CEO on allegations that it solicited U.S. users via unregistered crypto derivatives offerings, and directed its employees and customers to hide their true location by using VPNs to evade compliance controls. The company said the complaint was ""disappointing as we have been working collaboratively with the CFTC for more than two years."" Nonetheless, the battle between Binance and the CFTC will likely result in a settlement in what would be a bullish move for the crypto industry, Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani contended.

The funding comes as EigenLabs prepares to launch the initial version of its EigenLayer protocol in phases throughout the year. The size of the round is notable during a protracted crypto winter that has seen investors focusing more on smaller, early-stage rounds.  Seattle-based EigenLabs was founded in 2021 to address the issue that it’s difficult to improve blockchain infrastructure without launching a new blockchain and the so-called trust network that offers security for the chain.  In September Ethereum shifted from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus method, which replaced crypto miners with validators, or “stakers,” who lock up tokens within the network to help keep it secure in exchange for financial reward. EigenLayer allows users to “restake” tokens that are locked up to validate Ethereum so those tokens can be reused to help secure other protocols.  “One of the central bottlenecks to innovation in today’s crypto ecosystem is the requirement for projects to bootstrap trust, or cryptoeconomic security,” said EigenLabs founder and CEO Sreeram Kannan in the press release. “We started working on EigenLayer in the hopes of creating a new model in which developers can easily consume trust, instead of needing to build trust, and design powerful systems of assurances that make the crypto ecosystem safer and more useful.” .  Kannan is an associate professor at the University of Washington and runs the UW Blockchain Lab. The EigenLayer team has deep experience with tech companies, including Amazon Web Services, Meta Platforms (the former Facebook) and Microsoft.  Other backers in the round included Electric Capital, Polychain Capital, Hack VC, Finality Capital Partners, andCoinbase Ventures, among others. EigenLabs last raised funds in August with a $14.5 million seed round led by Polychain Capital and Ethereal Ventures.

Cloud mining services own and operate infrastructure and rent out hashrate to users. Hashrate is a measure of the total amount of computer processing power to secure a cryptocurrency. APT43 uses stolen cryptocurrency to pay for these services and receives crypto not associated with the crime to wallets of its choice, according to the report released on Tuesday.  The group is ""moderately sophisticated"" and supports the strategic and nuclear objectives of the North Korean regime, according to Mandiant. It uses the proceeds from cybercrime to fund its operations, which target South Korean and U.S. government organizations, academics and think tanks focused on the geopolitics of the Korean peninsula, the report said.  To acquire the crypto, APT43 steals credentials, often by phishing attacks. That is, it creates legitimate-looking websites – for example, a site masquerading as a crypto exchange – and persuades unsuspecting users to reveal personal information.  North Korean hackers have been increasingly including crypto in their operations, often in high-profile digital heists like the $100 million Horizon Bridge theft, according to the FBI.

New capital rules requiring banks to treat unbacked crypto assets like bitcoin (BTC) as the riskiest kind of asset should be in effect by January 2025, said Pablo Hernández de Cos, who chairs the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.  The Basel Committee finalized its rules in December despite protests from traditional finance firms who complained that plans to cap banks’ crypto holdings could limit innovation in distributed-ledger technology.  Those rules could be modified if they turn out to have a knock-on impact on finance, the Spanish central banker said at an event hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.  “Since we know that is market is evolving, what we will be doing with this standard is to focus on certain elements that might be particularly exposed to changes in the market,” Hernández de Cos said. “We should be prepared to modify the standard if needed, to try to cover the potential endogenous response of the market.”  Hernández de Cos said the committee would be monitoring implementation of the rules. Major jurisdictions that are members of the committee are supposed to put them in place in just under two years’ time, and lawmakers in some places such as the European Union have already made moves to do so.  In the U.S., crypto specialist banks Silvergate and Signature have both collapsed over the past few weeks.  The rules were “about indirectly trying to eliminate the potential risk that crypto markets might pose to other markets,” Hernández de Cos said. “There might be potential spillover effects from crypto to the banking sector.”  Read more: Basel Committee Endorses Global Crypto Banking Rules to Be Implemented by 2025",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/28/crypto-banking-rules-could-be-modified-if-market-reacts-basel-committee-chair-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ae2b7e1185fa9a7cfbb3eb10110005b1e61b9524-5500x3094.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The CFTC on Monday sued Binance and CEO Changpeng Zhao, alleging they knowingly offered unregistered crypto derivatives products. The regulator is charging the exchange and its founder with allegedly violating laws against offering futures transactions, failing to register as a futures commissions merchant and poorly supervising operations, among other things.  ""This seemed to be a pretty clear case of evasion and something that we needed to step in aggressively with and do it as quickly as possible because this was an ongoing fraud – going back to 2019 – and ongoing violation of the Commodity Exchange Act,"" Behnam told CNBC.  “We feel pretty confident in this case, obviously something that we care about deeply and that we've been on top of for several years in this crypto space,” Behnam added.  Court documents filed on Monday contained internal chats from Binance, including one from Samuel Lim, the exchange’s chief compliance officer through January 2022. “On the surface we cannot be seen to have U.S. users but in reality we should get them through other creative means,"" Lim allegedly said.  Behnam also referred to charges that there was clear communication from Binance to clients encouraging them to use virtual private networks (VPN) to conceal their true location in order to access global markets online.  “Not having a headquarters, not having a location is not going to prevent the CFTC from coming after you,” Behnam told CNBC.

42412534,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl57v2,1680012869,Crypto Exchange Mango Markets Considers Raising Interest Rates for Popular Tokens,"The governing body that manages decentralized crypto exchange Mango Markets is voting on boosting the interest rates the Solana-based protocol pays to lenders of its most popular tokens.  All tokens pools at 50% utilization – meaning half of user-supplied tokens are being lent out – would offer 1.8% interest under the proposal, an increase from the existing rate of zero. That utilization level is also lower than the current 70% at which effective interest rates increase or decrease based on how strained a pool has become.  The proposed changes stem from concerns that Mango Markets’ current measures might falter if utilization rates climb too high – a situation that would prevent lenders from withdrawing tokens or borrowers from taking new positions. By paying higher rates at lower utilization levels, Mango is looking to better retain existing deposits and woo newcomers.  The organization's legal troubles and waning energy for Solana-based decentralized finance have put a damper on trader demand for borrowing and lending tokens. Only Mango’s SOL pool had a high enough utilization rate (78%) at press time to be affected by the changes, Mango’s statistics show. That pool had just 264 tokens (roughly $5,500) available to borrow.  The motion would take effect three days after its passage. It is being considered by MNGO token holders in a vote that ends Wednesday. At press time it had unanimous support, but had not reached the necessary quorum to pass.

Since then it has processed over 350,000 transactions.

Zero-knowledge (ZK) technology is seen by many as the ultimate expansion system for blockchains by increasing the speed of transactions and reducing their fees.  A zkEVM is a type of ZK rollup that is compatible with Ethereum Virtual Machine, the software that deploys smart contracts. Having a ZK rollup that is compatible with the EVM means developers won’t need to reconfigure their applications on Ethereum and can move them over without any hiccups.  In recent days there has been a lot of activity in the zero-knowledge space in the Ethereum ecosystem.

On March 8, Silvergate Bank, part of Silvergate Capital ( SI ) announced it would self-liquidate as it experienced a severe drop in deposits after crytpocurrency exchange FTX's bankruptcy. The loss of deposits caused Silvergate Bank to sell debt securities to cover deposit withdrawals, which resulted in a net earnings loss of $1B. The FDIC board voted unanimously on March 12 to recommend that the Secretary of the Treasury make a systemic risk determination that would allow the FDIC to extend to deposit insurance protection to all of SVB and Signature Bank's depositors, including those deposits over the $250K cap, when winding down those banks, Gruenberg said in prepared remarks . He cited concerns of ""negative knock-on consequences for depositors and the financial system more broadly,"" if uninsured depositors didn't receive immediate assistance. ""There were also concerns that investors could begin to doubt the financial strength of similarly situated institutions making it difficult and more expensive for these banks to obtain needed capital and wholesale funding,"" according to his remarks. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also determined the that least-cost provisions to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act would have serious effects on economic conditions and financial stability, he will say. He will point out the action does not protect shareholders or unsecured debt holders of the two failed banks and that the board and most senior executives at the banks were removed.

Bankman-Fried has yet to be arraigned on five of the 13 total charges against him, the letter said.  On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan also approved changes to Bankman-Fried's bail restrictions focused on his use of electronic devices. Bankman-Fried can no longer communicate with former FTX or Alameda Research (FTX's trading arm) employees except when counsel is present, or use any ""encrypted or ephemeral call or messaging application, including but not limited to 'Signal.'""  He is limited to a new laptop or phone that provides access only to about 40 pre-approved websites that are necessary for his defense or are for personal use ""and do not pose a risk of danger to the community."" The latter group include major newspapers and crypto publications.  Bankman-Fried's new laptop will include software that will block access to USB storage devices, preventing him from transferring data to or from the device, and track his activity. He will be limited to voice calls and SMS text messages on his new smart phone. He must turn over his old laptop and smart phone to his attorneys who will remove it from his home.  Meetings with visitors must be arranged in advance with his defense attorneys, who will ensure that a security guard is present to screen for unauthorized electronic devices through the use of a handheld metal detector.

This rush to the exits is quite a bit smaller than that seen following the February crackdown on New York-based BUSD issuer Paxos by the New York Department of Financial Services and a Wells Notice of potential action from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Binance at that time processed over $2 billion in BUSD outflows.  Some analysts pointed to Binance’s decision to shift towards other stablecoins as a key reason behind the relatively soft impact on BUSD over the past day. The exchange ended zero-fee trading for BUSD-listed trading pairs on March 22, moving them over to trueUSD (TUSD)-listed pairs instead.  “It might be due to the fact that Binance was preparing for the transition from BUSD to an alternative stablecoin such as TUSD or USDC,” CryptoQuant head of marketing Hochan Chung told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.  “Also, the changes in Binance's exchange reserves of [bitcoin], [ether] and other stablecoins are not notably significant,"" Chung added. ""Only the BNB price has been damaged (down 5.78% in the past 24 hours) from the issue,” Chung added. BNB is the exchange token of Binance.  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Monday sued crypto exchange Binance and founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao on allegations the company knowingly offered unregistered crypto derivatives products in the U.S. against federal law.  Zhao has since stated the company did not agree with the characterization of many of the issues, and touted the exchange’s compliance technology.  The filing caused tremors in the crypto markets, however, with bitcoin falling 3% in the past 24 hours and Binance-related BNB tokens falling as much as 5% before a modest recovery.  BUSD, however, has shown signs of resilience despite the turbulence. The token has maintained its dollar peg and had only slightly above-average outflows of over $500 million. There have been no unforeseen incidents concerning BUSD that have taken place on BNB chain-based decentralized finance applications, in which the stablecoin plays a huge role.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued crypto exchange Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao on Monday on allegations the company knowingly offered unregistered crypto derivatives products in the U.S. against federal law. The lawsuit, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, alleged that Binance operated a derivatives trading operation in the U.S., offering trades for cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, ether, litecoin (LTC), tether (USDT) and binance USD (BUSD), all of which the suit referred to as commodities. The suit also alleges that the company, under Zhao’s leadership, directed its employees to spoof their locations through the use of virtual private networks.  In a blog post Monday, Zhao said that the lawsuit contained “an incomplete recitation of facts,” saying that “we do not agree with the characterization of many of the issues alleged in the complaint” and calling the complaint “unexpected and disappointing.” Zhao touted the exchange giant’s compliance technology, including its know-your-customer program. He wrote that the exchange had 750 people in its compliance teams, “many with prior law enforcement and regulatory agency backgrounds,” and noted that the company had 16 licenses and registrations worldwide.  Bitcoin sank below $27,000 following news of the lawsuit, dropping to its lowest level since March 17. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap is down 5% in the past 24 hours to about $26,700. Binance coin (BNB) declined by 5%. Matteo Bottacini, a trader at Crypto Finance AG, wrote in a morning note that investors are taking long positions in ether and other altcoins and short positions in bitcoin. “My bias is that upside for BTC looks now limited to the $30Ks while ETH and most of the altcoins are still waiting for the exploit,” he wrote. “Similarly, on the way down, despite BTC being the mega-cap here, I can easily see it trading in the $25k-$22.5k range.”  Chart of the Day  Bitcoin's daily chart shows the stochastic indicator has turned down from the above 80 or overbought reading, suggesting weakness ahead.

The plans, considered alongside measures to forbid businesses from accepting large cash payments and create a new European Union Anti-Money Laundering Agency, AMLA, were approved by the parliament’s Economics and Civil Liberties committees on Tuesday, with six abstentions.  99 lawmakers voted in favor, while eight voted against the limits.  Damien Carême, the French lawmaker who leads the parliament’s negotiations on the overhaul, earlier told reporters that the plans wouldn’t prevent crypto payments, because the cap of 1,000 euros won’t apply if a regulated wallet provider is involved or the identity of the payer is known.  The measures were proposed following a string of dirty money scandals within the bloc, including the ""Pandora Papers"" leaks and concerning the processing of Russian funds by Danske Bank.  The vote allows negotiations to begin with the Council, representing European Union member states, which has sought to outlaw cryptocurrencies that permit anonymity, such as monero and dash. In April the parliament is also set to provide final signing off to rules ensuring payers are identified when funds are transferred.

42387837,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQu39r,1680000523,"CFTC-Binance Lawsuit Could Worsen Crypto Market Liquidity, Pull Bitcoin Down to $25K: Observers","Poor liquidity, a problem plaguing crypto markets since the collapse of the FTX exchange in November, could worsen, breeding price volatility as regulators go after dominant exchange Binance.  On Monday, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) sued Binance for running an alleged ""illegal exchange"" and a ""sham"" compliance program. The regulator, which is responsible for oversight of commodities and derivatives markets, including the derivatives tied to bitcoin (BTC), sued Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao and former top compliance executive Samuel Lim, alleging ""willful evasion"" of the U.S. law.  Binance has long been the leading digital assets exchange and accounted for a much bigger share of the global trading volumes than its former rival FTX. Per Morgan Stanley, the exchange accounted for 81% of the total BTC traded on centralized exchanges in February. According to the case document, a single trader from Chicago is responsible for 12% of the total trading volume on Binance.  Observers, therefore, are worried the lawsuit would bring a deeper decline in the market liquidity – a measure of how difficult or easy it is to trade large quantities at stable prices.  ""The main worry is what this will do short-term to market liquidity. If market makers step back from trading on Binance now, and if Binance's U.S.-based trading desks have to stop operations, that will reduce liquidity in an already thin market,"" Noelle Acheson, the author of the Crypto is Macro Now newsletter, said.  ""That will exacerbate volatility and could keep some large players on the sidelines for a while longer,"" Acheson added.  Liquidity is widely measured by a metric called the 2% market depth – a collection of the buy and sell orders within 2% of the mid-price or the average of the bid and the ask/offer prices.  The greater the market depth, the less likely that large buy/sell orders will cause significant deviations in the asset's market price. Market makers are entities that provide liquidity to a financial market by creating buy and sell orders that aren't executed immediately.  Bitcoin's 2% market depth slipped to a 10-month low last week, extending the deterioration seen since FTX's sister firm Alameda Research, formerly one of the largest market makers, closed shop five months ago.  The situation will persist for a while, according to DRW-subsidiary Cumberland, one of the earliest and longest-standing crypto market makers.  ""This lawsuit will certainly exacerbate tightness in the already-strained digital asset banking system, and as a knock-on effect, it will damage liquidity,"" Cumberland said in a tweet explaining the impact of the regulatory action on the market.  Pullback likely  Some observers expect bitcoin to revisit the former resistance-turned-support near $25,000 in the wake of the heightened regulatory uncertainty.  ""It is clear that the CFTC wants oversight on all crypto exchanges. It's not something new, but the market is reacting prudently and we are still holding our breath for further negative news, which may push BTC down,"" Laurent Kssis, a crypto trading adviser at CEC Capital, told CoinDesk.  ""Long rekts [liquidations], which increased [Monday], will inevitably push prices down, possibly below support near $25,000,"" Kssis added.  Bitcoin fell by over 3% on Monday, hitting lows near $26,500 in response to the CFTC's action against Binance. The cryptocurrency has since stabilized around $27,000, having put in a nine-month high of $28,889 on March 23, CoinDesk data shows.  Derivatives exchanges on Monday liquidated or forced closed bullish long futures positions worth more than $25 million, a sharp rise from Sunday's $3.6 million figure, according to Glassnode. Meanwhile, short liquidations amounted to just $7 million. Forced closures of long/short positions often add to bearish/bullish pressures around the cryptocurrency.  According to Acheson, the lawsuit is not good news for market valuation because it adds ""yet another layer of uncertainty and is not a good 'look' for the ecosystem, coming soon after another high-profile fraud.""  Acheson, however, expects recent macroeconomic developments such as increased expectations for a quick Federal Reserve pivot in favor of interest rate cuts to cushion markets from the negative impact of the Binance news.  ""For BTC, [ether] and other majors, we're seeing some selling interest that is supported by buyers coming in. This is a very different market than November, with a pivot in sight and new narratives motivating new types of investment decisions,"" Acheson noted. ""Psychologically, it's not as much a blow as the FTX implosion since the market has been warned repeatedly that something like this was coming.""",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/28/binance-lawsuit-may-worsen-crypto-market-liquidity-pull-bitcoin-down-to-25k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2787ea8cd8e1405602506ffccfd3450ae51780f1-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42387825,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQu2Tl,1679997600,Newly Formed ZeroSync Association Brings Zero-Knowledge Proofs to Bitcoin,"Three German computer scientists have created a Swiss nonprofit called the ZeroSync Association to help scale Bitcoin by using zero-knowledge proofs (zk-proofs), a cryptographic technique that has exploded in popularity on rival chain Ethereum.  Zero-knowledge proofs use cryptography to prove the validity of information without revealing the information itself. Using a zk-proof to validate the Bitcoin blockchain means nodes can sync almost instantly instead of taking hours (and sometimes days) to download the chain’s current 500 GB of data.  ZeroSync has already produced a working prototype that allows users to validate the state (who owns what right now) and transaction history of the Bitcoin blockchain without downloading the entire chain or trusting a third party.  The prototype can verify Bitcoin consensus rules but not transaction signatures. It’s also a bit clunky and still needs to be optimized for speed and security, so it’s not ready for prime time just yet, but the important thing is it works.  “It's very much in the prototype stage,” ZeroSync co-founder Robin Linus told CoinDesk. “But the grand vision is that you download that one megabyte of proof and that is as good as if you had downloaded the 500 gigabytes.”  Light clients or simple payment verification (SPV) nodes have always existed on the Bitcoin blockchain. In fact, Satoshi Nakamoto mentioned the concept in the Bitcoin white paper. They are critical for small devices like mobile phones that can’t download the entire blockchain.  “It is possible to verify payments without running a full network node,” Satoshi wrote. ""Verification is reliable as long as honest nodes control the network, but is more vulnerable if the network is overpowered by an attacker.”  ZeroSync goes a step further by verifying transactions via cryptographic proof rather than merely trusting honest nodes as suggested by Satoshi.  “You don't have to trust. That is the entire point,” said Linus. “The proof proves it to you. That's the great invention.”  A fully functioning zk-proof mechanism can be used to enable a wide range of applications outside of the flagship node syncing use case. ZeroSync has created a developer tool kit to enable applications like proof-of-reserves on exchanges and transaction history compression on second layer protocols like Lightning Labs’ Taro.  Linus and fellow co-founder Lukas George joined forces in July to work on implementing a full chain proof of the Bitcoin blockchain after George’s undergraduate thesis on implementing a proof of Bitcoin's headers caught the attention of Geometry Research.  The team subsequently added Tino Steffens to the mix; all three co-founders have a background in computer science.  Linus was living in Santa Teresa, a remote beach town on Costa Rica's Nicoya Peninsula that has one ATM machine with a 10 p.m. curfew. It drove Linus nuts and forced him to research alternative payment methods. He stumbled upon Bitcoin, befriended the well-respected “Bitcoin sorcerer” Ruben Somsen (who coined the term “ZeroSync”), and the rest, as they say, is history.  “From there, I started to learn more and more about cryptography,” Linus said. “I developed some skills over time and then Ruben recommended me to Geometry Research. They offered me the opportunity to build STARK proofs for Bitcoin and that's also how I got in touch with Lucas.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | RESEARCH,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/03/28/newly-formed-zerosync-association-brings-zero-knowledge-proofs-to-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/61d11bc7b919eef4c4cae25911c0e167a7e55f63-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Anti-Money Laundering Regulation set to be discussed by the Economic and Civil Liberties committees would impose a limit of 1,000 euros (US$1,080) for payments made from self-hosted wallets where it isn’t possible to identify the payer.  “We are absolutely not preventing crypto transactions,” Damien Carême, a French lawmaker from the Green party, told reporters. “It’s just when identification isn’t possible.”  Carême, one of the two lawmakers jointly responsible for negotiating the law on behalf of the parliament, also referred to provisions on money laundering in the metaverse, saying he didn’t want to see dirty money inhibited by banking controls to simply flow into other sectors.  Should the vote pass, lawmakers will enter into negotiations from the EU’s Council, representing the bloc’s member states, to frame a consistent version of the law.  In a draft last year, the Council sought to prevent banks or crypto providers from handling cryptocurrencies that guarantee anonymity – but Carême said a ban on the likes of dash, monero and zcash wasn’t needed as they were already outlawed by the EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets regulation (MiCA).

The EVM is housed within an EOS smart contract and aims to offer high-speed transactions at cheap fees for users and developers. The move aims to eventually bolster decentralized finance (DeFi) development on the EOS network, which ultimately accrues value for eos tokens.  EVMs refer to the environment in which all Ethereum accounts and smart contracts live, serving as a virtual computer utilized by developers for creating decentralized applications (dapps).  When deployed on other blockchains, EVMs can allow developers to build dapps and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications similar to how they would on Ethereum.  EVMs are a large part of EOS’ future plans, touted as the blockchain’s ""second innings.""  “Many of the developers who have left EOS have done so not because they want to, but because Ethereum, for all its deficiencies, is where the action is,” the foundation said in a January post.  “EVM compatibility is essential to the potential of EOS, not just technically but also from a business perspective. Ultimately, it is essential that we welcome more Solidity developers and users to EOS, and an EVM on EOS is an excellent bridge to do just that,” it added at the time.

The Bernstein report comes after the regulator sued the crypto exchange and its founder Changpeng Zhao for allowing U.S. citizens to trade derivatives and for willful evasion of the country’s laws.  The CFTC is charging Binance with violating laws around futures offerings, illegal off-exchange commodity options, failing to register as a futures commissions merchant, designated contract market or swap execution facility and other charges related to its know-your-customer (KYC) or anti-money laundering (AML) processes.  Binance.US is a minor part of the overall business and makes up less than 5% of the exchange’s global operations, the report said.  Given that cryptocurrency trading is a global business, Bernstein expects that Binance will look to “safeguard its dominant international business, which is its cash cow, and where it has worked on licenses in Europe, Africa and Australia,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agrawal wrote.  The broker says this latest enforcement is not “material to overall crypto markets” as Binance.US operations are not material, and it doesn’t expect this news to trigger a large selloff in the market, as the “regulatory narrative” has pivoted from the U.S. to expected Hong Kong and China flows. The Hong Kong retail crypto market is expected to open as of June 1.  Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, was trading 2.8% lower at $27,047 at time of writing.

XRP traded just under 50 cents in Asian morning hours on Tuesday, reaching a five-month high. Its XRP Ledger network has seen fundamental upgrades in the past few months that may have contributed to the rise.  However, a part of the bullish outlook came as some in the community said the classification of major tokens as a commodity in the CFTC filing against Binance could mean XRP tokens were, too, commodities instead of a security, as alleged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the ongoing Ripple v. SEC case.  Ripple Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz has previously made the case for XRP tokens as a commodity. “XRP is a raw good that trades in commerce and one XRP is treated as equivalent to every other XRP. That's pretty much the definition of a ""commodity,” Schwartz said in a January tweet.  “No part of XRP's value comes from anyone else's legal obligations to XRP holders,” he said at the time.  Ripple has historically maintained a distance from its relation to XRP, the token that powers some of Ripple’s products and the XRP Ledger network. Any progression in the case causes XRP price movement, however.  Binance and CEO Changpeng Zhao were sued Monday as the CFTC alleges Binance offered unregistered crypto derivatives products and directed U.S. customers to evade compliance controls through the use of virtual privacy networks (VPN).  The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on Monday, alleges Binance operates a derivatives trading operation in the U.S., offering trades for cryptocurrencies including bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), tether (USDT) and Binance USD (BUSD), which the lawsuit referred to as commodities.  Bitcoin fell below $27,000, losing a local support level, while ether briefly dropped under $1,700 before recovering. Overall market capitalization fell nearly 3%, CoinGecko data shows.  Markets slumped almost immediately – but some market observers found optimism in the fact that tokens mentioned in the CFTC filing were commodities and not securities.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin is hovering around $27,000 after the CFTC takes action against Binance.  Insights: The Hong Kong branches of China's state-run banks want crypto. Now for the hard part.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,163 −34.4 ▼ 2.9% Bitcoin (BTC) $26,958 −1062.0 ▼ 3.8% Ethereum (ETH) $1,709 −71.7 ▼ 4.0% S&P 500  3,977.53 +6.5 ▲ 0.2% Gold  $1,960 −22.3 ▼ 1.1% Nikkei 225  27,476.87 +91.6 ▲ 0.3% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  It's the CFTC vs. Liquidity  Good morning. Bitcoin is starting the Asia business day down 3.8% to $26,958 after the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) sued crypto exchange Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao, alleging it offered unregistered crypto derivatives in the U.S.  Binance’s BNB token is down 5.9% to $308 on the allegations.  The question on the traders' minds is how much of a going concern Binance is now that the CFTC has struck this blow. On the one hand, Binance’s CEO called the CFTC complaint “unexpected and disappointing,” yet, in February, the exchange said it is prepared to pay monetary penalties to “make amends” for sins of the past.  At the same time, there is some debate about how much traders are shrugging off the CFTC’s allegations versus how much bitcoin has an ability to react to news because of a lack of liquidity.  “When you have low liquidity, you tend to get very quiet markets,” Dan Gunsberg, co-founder of Solana-based derivatives liquidity protocol Hxro, said during a recent CoinDesk TV appearance. “You get these jumps in the market and these liquidity vacuums, where things move to a new price and immediately settle down again.”  At the same time as the CFTC goes after Binance, the decentralization narrative continues.  Decentralized derivatives exchange GMX's token rose by 4% during the last 24 hours, almost in parallel to how tokens of decentralized ether liquid staking platforms rose in February when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission took aim at staking.  But just because something is decentralized, doesn’t mean regulators can’t go after it.

But opening an account with them is another thing altogether.  Bloomberg reported Monday that the banks making the pitches have gotten the green light from Beijing, and their respective headquarters.  Sources from multiple crypto companies in Hong Kong that had either been pitched by the banks’ sales representatives, or made inbound inquiries, all say that the criteria for opening an account is burdensome and the know-your-customer/anti-money laundering (KYC/AML) process is longer than opening a regular business account.  For instance, banks prefer that executives and key personnel at the crypto company reside in Hong Kong. A definite blocker would be if they are mainland Chinese nationals or U.S. citizens. If the company is owned by a Singapore-based parent, that firm would need to be a licensed entity by the Monetary Authority of Singapore.  Sources were also told to expect a long account-opening process.  Is it really progress?  These banks, such as Bank of China and Bank of Communications, are some of the world’s largest, and it’d be unthinkable a few years ago that they would be actively soliciting crypto business considering Beijing’s hardline stance on the issue and the general hesitation of large banks to engage with crypto.  After all, in the U.S., Silvergate and Signature found their market niche for this exact reason, with analysts saying the crypto industry will have a “difficult time finding traditional banks that will work with it” post their demise. These two banks made – and lost – their fortune with crypto: At the turn of the decade, they were both small, unknown banks before embracing crypto; Silvergate reported $2.12 billion in assets in December 2019 and peaked at $16 billion in December 2021.  Although both Silvergate and Signature grew significantly throughout crypto’s boom years and institutionalization, their relatively small size means that they fell faster than they would have if they were larger like some of their peers.  But not everyone thinks this is the first chapter of something new, considering the tough onboarding process.  ""The city’s digital assets regulation is overall friendly and encourages banks to work with crypto companies, however, banks still currently have stringent requirements in place which makes it difficult for crypto businesses to expand and grow,” Adrian Wang, founder and CEO of Metalpha, a Hong Kong-based digital assets wealth management company, said to CoinDesk. “We have yet to see major progress in the banking sector to embrace crypto.

The suit also alleges that the company, under Zhao’s leadership, directed its employees to spoof their locations through the use of virtual private networks.  Zhao touted the exchange giant’s compliance technology, including its know-your-customer program.  He wrote that the exchange had 750 people in its compliance teams, “many with prior law enforcement and regulatory agency backgrounds,” and noted that the company had 16 licenses and registrations worldwide.  According to the CFTC, the exchange, which has a U.S. affiliate, Binance.US, created a system to hide its true reach and operations.  In a press release, CFTC Chief Counsel Gretchen Lowe called Binance’s actions “willful evasion of U.S. law,” pointing to internal chats and emails.  Moreover, the suit alleged, Binance directed customers in the U.S. to use a variety of methods to evade restrictions on U.S-based customers. “Binance has instructed U.S. customers to evade such controls by using [virtual privacy networks] to conceal their true location,” the suit alleges.  In his blog post, Zhao highlighted Binance’s 90-day, no-day-trading policy, writing that employees “are not allowed to sell a coin within 90 days of” their most recent purchases, or the reverse. “This is to prevent any employees from actively trading. We also prohibit our employees from trading in Futures,” Zhao wrote.  In listing the CEO as a defendant, the CFTC alleges that Zhao was the “direct or indirect owner of entities that have engaged in proprietary trading activity on the Binance platform,” and was likewise the “direct or indirect owner of approximately 300 separate Binance accounts” that engaged in prop trading on the Binance trading platform.  Zhao wrote that he has two accounts at Binance, one for his Binance Card and the other for his crypto holdings. “I eat our own dog food and store my crypto on Binance.com,” he wrote, adding that he occasionally converted crypto to pay “for personal expenses or for the Card.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | SPONSORED | TRADING | BNB,James Rubin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/28/binance-ceo-zhao-calls-cftc-suit-an-incomplete-recitation-of-facts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/71e21d3dff660e6c19807fe8043b7b9813ce9072-5568x3132.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
