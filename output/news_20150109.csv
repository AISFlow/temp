42398112,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSSq6,1420843817,Overstock Installs Bitcoin ATM at Corporate HQ,"US retail giant Overstock has installed a bitcoin ATM in the lobby of its Salt Lake City, Utah headquarters.  Part of an effort to further encourage digital currency use amongst its staff, the news coincides with the announcement that it is in the process of offering its employees the option to receive their pay in bitcoin. Further, it comes just one year after it first began offering US customers a bitcoin payment option through Coinbase.  Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, who has been an outspoken advocate of the digital currency, spoke to CoinDesk about the endeavor to give bitcoin a greater part of the global economy by first increasing its mainstream use.  ""Right now you mention and bitcoins and for most people it’s like you’re talking about space cash,"" he said, adding:  “Things like an ATM machine and seeing people standing in line in front of you are what’s going to make it start registering for people.”  The ATM unit (pictured above) was manufactured by North Carolina-based CoinOutlet.  Employee bitcoin bonuses  Byrne said he is “confident” that a year from now Overstock could see its employee bitcoin pay scheme begin implementation, adding that it might even try it this year with employee bonuses, offering a 1% to 2% bonus should the employee choose accept it in bitcoin.  Overstock communications director and general manager of Overstock’s Cryptocurrencies Group Judd Bagley said that since the company has incorporated bitcoin into its business, the internal attitude toward the digital currency has developed significantly.  ""I compare how people felt about it one year ago with today – when one year ago most people found it confusing, it was not at all intuitive,"" he said. ""Now, a year after accepting bitcoin on the side and people doing their own research, it’s just part of the parlance; it doesn't surprise anyone here anymore.""  He added:  ""I thought we'd have to send out a company email explaining what this machine is in the lobby … everyone I’ve spoken to is really excited.""  Byrne still bullish  Overstock’s continued support for and interest in bitcoin remains despite its missed sales expectations.  In September, Overstock launched internationally, and although earlier in 2014 the company had estimated it could record up to $20m in sales, by December the figures were closer to $3m.  “I was really counting on a big year and nothing came,” he said. “There’s almost no international use of bitcoin.”  Nevertheless, Byrne said he sees bitcoin ""as the fruition of a 500-year political movement"" and has been especially vocal on the subject as the chief executive of a major retail company, a speaker at the Cato Institute and as a principal reporter of the website DeepCapture.  He said he sees bitcoin as representative of about 15 basis points (one basis point equals 0.01%) of economic activity that the community can power to 1% or 2%.  “That’s growing gradually,” he said. “The wallets are growing tremendously but people aren’t using them very much … Like other technologies, it’ll gradually move from 15 basis point to 20 to 30 and then it’ll hit an inflection.”  ATM image via CoinOutlet",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | RESEARCH,Tanaya Macheel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/01/09/overstock-installs-bitcoin-atm-at-corporate-hq,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7c3f1a48c5f8e1259f282d00aea85238d27b670e-1500x1024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398114,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSSt3,1420840428,Dutch Scrypt Mining Company Declared Bankrupt,"Mining ASICs Technologies (MAT) was declared bankrupt by a Maastricht, Netherlands, judge on 30th December, one week after company CEO Marc Coumans filed for bankruptcy.  CoinDesk confirmed MAT's filing with Mr CFMP Spreksel, the curator in charge of overseeing the management and liquidation of the company's assets.  The Dutch ASIC manufacturer began to take pre-orders for its line of Scrypt-based miners in March of last year, and announced plans to expand its production line to include SHA-256 miners for bitcoin mining as well.  To produce the required chips, MAT said it had secured a partnership with German ASIC producer Dream Chip Technologies, and would produce miners in the price ranges of approximately $3,500–$17,500.  MAT's offerings were initially met with the skepticism on message boards such as Bitcoin Talk and Litecoin Talk. However, Coumans' public appearances at conferences like Inside Bitcoins Hong Kong and office visits conducted by local bitcoin miners and media provided many customers with the required confidence to make purchases.  Customers were required to pay 35% of the production costs upfront, while miners were expected to be shipped in Q3 2014.  Turning tide  Business seemed to turn sour for MAT around the time the machines where supposed to ship in September. Scam accusations began to appear on several massage boards soon after.  Customers levied accusations of fraud and false advertising, claiming Coumans willfully lied about the speed of the chips. It was even asserted that no established partnership between MAT and Dream Chip Technologies existed. Dream Chip Technologies did not confirm or deny its involvement with MAT.  Moreover, as the end of the September approached, only a small fraction of customers had received their machines. According to e-mails sent out by Coumans, there was a problem with the air cooling of the chips, which he said should be resolved shortly.  Controversy remains  According to a source close to MAT that wishes to remain anonymous, the company had been in trouble since June, months before it stopped pre-orders.  ""MAT agreed to a joint venture with ASIC manufacturer Alcheminer, costing roughly $2m. As it turned out, however, pre-orders at MAT didn't add up to $2m-worth, which meant that MAT did not receive enough chips to meet all of these pre-orders,"" he told CoinDesk.  Alcheminer claims to have provided all of MAT's chips as promised, but says it hasn't been paid off in full. The source suggested MAT had insufficient funds to cover other costs required to build the ASIC miners, such as the cost of software and additional hardware, and that MAT engaged in questionable activities regarding its cloud mining operations.  Such statements were strongly contradicted by Coumans in a statement to CoinDesk.  ""All of this is a blatant smear campaign,” Coumans said. “Because of these false allegations, a lot of our customers became scared they would lose all of their downpayments. This led to many of them asking for refunds, while some big customers even canceled their contracts with us.""  He added: ""This is what led to MAT's bankruptcy.""  Customers remain waiting  Appointed bankruptcy curator Spreksel only just started to research the company's bookkeeping and history this week, but told CoinDesk that it will take another three to five weeks before any sort of meaningful conclusions can be drawn.  Estimates suggest that more than a dozen customers lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in investments with MAT, Spreksel said. Spreksel added that the prospects of any of MAT's customers and creditors having any money returned to them seems quite grim, but emphasized that it's too soon to know for sure.  Coumans told CoinDesk that he was unable to provide any further information at the time of publishing, due to legal reasons.

42398113,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSSs4,1420833813,Bitcoin Exchange Bitstamp Resumes Services,"Bitcoin exchange Bitstamp has resumed services after having gone offline following a damaging hot wallet attack on 5th January that saw the exchange lose 19,000 BTC.  The exchange announced today that its website is once again open for business and made note of a host of new services being offered to Bitstamp customers.  Bitstamp's blog post announcing its return to business details how the exchange has rebuilt its systems ""from the ground up"" in an effort to prevent a repeat of its recent security breach.  Updates to the exchange service include a migration to Amazon's AWS cloud infrastructure, new hardware systems and the integration of BitGo's multi-signature wallet technology.  As a consolation for being offline in recent days, Bitstamp is also offering commission-free trading to all of its customers until 17th January at 11:59pm UTC.  Bitstamp's website indicates trading will resume at 21:00 UTC 9th January.    We are pleased to confirm that customers have resumed normal bitcoin transaction activity on http://t.co/4J0wH6JrRG      — Bitstamp (@Bitstamp) January 9, 2015      Timeline of the attack and outage  The hackers struck on Sunday, 4th January, and on Monday Bitstamp reported a hot wallet issue, advising customers not to deposit bitcoin to old addresses. Later that day the exchange revealed that it lost roughly 19,000 BTC in the breach, valued at upwards of $5m at the time of the attack.  Bitstamp said a number of wallets were compromised and, upon learning of the breach, the exchange issued warnings and started to suspend operations. Bitstamp CEO Nejc Kodrič said the breach represented a “small fraction” of the exchange’s total reserves, as the majority of the reserves are held offline in cold storage.  On Tuesday, Slovenian media reported that the site would resume operations within 24 hours, quoting Bitstamp co-founder Damijan Merlak. Merlak told Slovenian state-owned news agency STA that the exchange had enough liquid assets to meet short term-obligations and that it was in the process of setting up a duplicate infrastructure in cooperation with experts in San Francisco.  On Monday afternoon, Kodrič tweeted that the redeployment is being filled with backup data for testing, giving an ETA of 24-48 hours for the re-launch.    Our redeployment is up internally and is being filled with backup data for testing. Relaunch ETA ~24-48h. Thank you for your patience! — Nejc Kodrič (@nejc_kodric) January 6, 2015          Kodrič also used Twitter to reassure customers that their balances held at Bitstamp prior to 5th of January are safe and will be honoured in full. He went on to tweet several updates, pointing out that he still does not have an exact time for the re-launch yet.    My earlier tweet of 48 hours was a rough timeframe. We are testing our redeployed system internally before going live again to customers.      — Nejc Kodrič (@nejc_kodric) January 7, 2015      Kodrič said he would keep Bitstamp users informed via Twitter updates and the company website. The temporary site was redesigned on Thursday to include additional information and a simple promise to customers – ""We are coming back soon!”  Tom Sharkey co-authored this report.

42398108,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSSmA,1420814600,Analysis: Bitstamp Hacker Almost Stole Additional $1.75 Million,"Bitstamp narrowly avoided losing an additional $1.75m in bitcoin during its recent hack, according to a blockchain analysis by an independent researcher.  In the final hours of a $5.1m heist that took place at the exchange five days ago, the $1.75m in bitcoin was quickly moved to an address thought to be used for cold storage by Bitstamp, analyst Danno Ferrin has found.  CoinDesk can confirm that the address in question was controlled by Bitstamp as recently as 2nd December. The firm's chief executive, Nejc Kodric, said at the time that the address was being used during an audit. While the CEO said the data was to be made public in the week of 8th December, the exchange hasn't published any audit results since 24th May.  Ferrin, who publishes his blockchain analysis at his blog CryptoCrumb, said the rescued funds likely came from the hundreds of addresses the exchange used to accept customer deposits. Those addresses appear to form the 'operational wallet' Bitstamp said was compromised on 4th January, leading to a heist of the $5.1m.  According to Ferrin's analysis, transaction data on the blockchain links funds flowing out of Bitstamp's operational wallet into the Bitstamp 'audit' address, as well as another address that is widely presumed to be controlled by the thief.  If Ferrin is right, then a total of $6.6m in Bitstamp funds were at risk of being stolen, although the exchange managed to rescue about a quarter of the funds in the nick of time.  ""It could have been worse,"" Ferrin wrote.  Flurry of transactions  The hack appears to have started in the early hours of 4th January, when 3,100 BTC was transferred into the theft wallet. Funds flowed in steadily for the next 16 hours. By 4pm, the address had a balance of over 6,000 coins.  Then the inflows accelerated. Late into 4th January and in the first hours of the next day, an additional 12,000 coins were placed in the theft wallet.  At this point, Bitstamp appeared to begin sweeping funds out of its hot wallet, placing them beyond the reach of the hackers.  The rescued funds were spirited into the cold storage address in a flurry of transfers taking place over about 30 minutes that saw 4,200 BTC deposited.  The exchange's address received two transactions of 1,000 BTC at 00:54 on 5th January. Some 15 minutes earlier, it had already taken in 22 transfers of 100 BTC. The large transfers continued until 01:06, when an additional four 100 BTC chunks were deposited.  All told, the cold storage address received a total of 6,478 BTC, worth about $1.8m, on 5th January. The theft address held 18,977 bitcoins at its height.  Race to grab funds  One explanation for what took place on 4th and 5th January is that the exchange was locked in a race with the intruder to grab funds out of the hot wallet.  The thief appeared to have access to all the addresses in Bitstamp's hot wallet, Ferrin says, because some transactions show the theft wallet generating a 'change address' that was later accessed by Bitstamp.  One example of this highlighted on Ferrin's blog shows 32 BTC sent to the theft address. This transaction generated a change address that contained about 0.64 BTC. Some 40 minutes later, this change address was emptied out, forming part of a transaction totalling 10 BTC to Bitstamp's cold storage address.  The thief's wallet, therefore, created a change address that was also accessible by Bitstamp. This suggests the thief had gained control of Bitstamp's internal systems governing its hot wallet and not merely that wallet's private keys, Ferrin said, adding:  ""They knew they were in a race between each other to claim what was left on the table.""  Analysis 'makes sense'  Ferrin wrote a piece of software called Numisight to perform blockchain analysis as a hobby. His day job is on a software deployment team at enterprise software giant Oracle. He says he intends to release his software soon.  One security researcher who has read Ferrin's analysis concurs with its conclusions.  Kristov Atlas, who started the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project, said the sequence of transactions was consistent with the notion that Bitstamp salvaged about a quarter of the funds at risk. He adds that the evidence remains inconclusive about precisely how the intruder breached Bitstamp's systems.  ""The timeline of Bitstamp working to sweep coins into cold storage in the final hours of the attack makes sense,"" Atlas said.  Unexplained details  Several other details of the attack transactions published to the blockchain continue to puzzle analysts like Ferrin, however.  A number of transactions to the theft wallet had high miner's fees of up to 1 BTC attached. Such high fees wouldn't have increased the priority of the transaction in many cases, because the transaction amounts were already large enough to grant it high-priority status among miners.  Miners value a transaction's priority by weighing its size and age, before considering the transaction fees attached.  Another issue is what appears to be continued activity and theft from Bitstamp's hot wallet. As recently as 8th January, coins continued to flow into the theft wallet, from what Ferrin and others presume to be addresses in which Bitstamp customers deposit funds.  The thief's decision to transfer all the ill-gotten funds to one address is also a puzzling one, Ferrin says.  Funnelling such a large amount of coins to one address encourages scrutiny on the blockchain. It also could make the coins more difficult for the thief to spend undetected.  ""Sending it all to one address was a huge mistake,"" Ferrin said. ""[If the coins were sold on an exchange], they would be asked to explain it. They would have left a trail.""  Stolen coins on the move  The stolen coins are now on the move. The original theft address has been largely emptied out with just 90.6 BTC remaining. The funds have been dispersed to dozens of new addresses – 47 at Ferrin's last count on 7th January.  A small number of coins now appear to have been sent to a coin mixer, which would make it more difficult for future buyers of the coins to trace them back to the Bitstamp theft.  But no matter where the stolen coins end up, the transactions surrounding the theft will now remain publicly available on the blockchain.  ""Things used to happen in the smoke-filled rooms which you would never know about, now the blockchain provides an opportunity to go back in time, prove them going backwards. It's kind of like sunlight being the best disinfectant,""said Ferrin.  Correction: Ferrin may release his software, but would keep the source proprietary. An earlier version of this article mistakenly said he would make his software open-source.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/01/09/analysis-bitstamp-hacker-almost-stole-additional-175-million,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0ad14c402fd24fdc112e2946a1ff8dc0e1ea96e6-1268x502.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398118,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSSw0,1420805235,Tibdit to Launch Bitcoin Tipping Tool for Publishers,"London-based startup Tibdit is to officially launch its new service on 19th January, allowing online content publishers to collect bitcoin micropayments through a Wordpress website plug-in.  The new service could add to the rising interest in micro-transactions characterised by ChangeTip, a social media tipping tool.  Payments to Tibdit can be made in bitcoin or with a credit or debit card, but must be collected in bitcoin. As a result, publishers will need a bitcoin address in order to cash out their funds. A demo of the service can be experienced here.  The company sets out a variety of scenarios in which Tibdit could be used for collecting tips, charitable donations or paid content. Bloggers, forums, reviewers, news sites, artists and local groups could all benefit from the service, it says.  Tibdit's founder and CEO Justin Maxwell said:  ""We hope it will result in people who will otherwise not have looked at bitcoin to get themselves a bitcoin address.""  Tibs not tips  Maxwell said his service is currently used by only two blogs as the firm has not begun to market its service widely yet.  Tibdit plans to market itself to bloggers before approaching established publishers. Maxwell said his service is still in 'beta' and that his team of four is looking to identify and resolve any problems that may arise with it.  Users who want to send funds on Tibdit have to purchase a bundle of 'tibs' from the service using either bitcoin or a fiat payment card.  Users set the value of each bundle of tibs before they are used. When the desire arises to tip or donate to a site, users click the Tibdit button to send a tip of that pre-determined value.  Tibdit charges 1.5 pence per transaction for its service.  Tipping trends  Maxwell met co-founder Pauline Hunter when they both worked in the British civil service at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Maxwell was a technology consultant and Hunter worked on compliance.  Tipping has become a buzzword in the cryptocurrency economy after the startup ChangeTip posted impressive numbers in November, claiming that 10,000 transactions passed through its service in one day.  The firm has created a 'love button' for a range of social media platforms that lets users tip others in bitcoin.  ChangeTip went on to raise a $3.5m seed round from high-profile investors Pantera Capital, 500 Startups and others the following month.  Micro-payments for online content have also grabbed the attention of established publishers in recent months. The New York Times Company and German publisher Axel Springer put €3m into a Dutch company called Blendle that lets readers pay newspapers to access individual articles.
