42379584,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Glyj,1499976630,Report: Indian Government Considers Tax on Bitcoin Purchases,"Local reports indicate that India may put in place a goods-and-services tax on bitcoin purchases.  Indian officials have been meeting for months to develop a legal framework for digital currencies, forming a special task force in April to study the issue and develop possible options. The question of legality for the tech under Indian law has been subject to speculation in the past, especially following public statements that, at one point, were interpreted as a blanket ban on bitcoin.  Regional news service The Hindu reports that new details on that process are emerging, including the possibility of taxes. Notably, according to one official's account, the topic of banning cryptocurrencies was indeed broached during a recent meeting – but in the end, the proposal received little support.  The official told the publication:  ""Banning will give a clear message that all related activities are illegal and will disincentivize those interested in taking speculative risks, but it was pointed out it will impede tax collection on gains made in such activities and that regulating the currency instead would signal a boost to blockchain technology, encourage the development of a supervision ecosystem (that tracks legal activities and may also assist in tracking illegal activities) and promote a formal tax base.""  Trading activity may also come under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), which regulates the country's securities market.  Ultimately, according to The Hindu, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may come to been viewed as kinds of digital assets under Indian law.

42379589,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Gm51,1499969744,Coinbase Granted One-Month Delay in Cryptsy Lawsuit Appeal,"Lawyers for Coinbase have won a month-long filing delay in the digital currency startup's appeal of a decision in an ongoing lawsuit tied to the now-defunct exchange Cryptsy.  Cryptsy  was a Florida-based cryptocurrency exchange that collapsed in late 2015 amid allegations of fraud and theft. A class action lawsuit against Cryptsy was filed soon afterward, with a judge in Florida ultimately approving the plaintiffs' bid to push the exchange into receivership.  The latest twist in that story began in December, when customers charged that Coinbase – which Cryptsy CEO Paul Vernon used to exchange bitcoin for dollars – should have known that the money he was moving was derived from user funds. The plaintiffs argued that approximately $8.3m in funds were allegedly stolen by Vernon in this manner.  In response, Coinbase sought to have the dispute resolved in private arbitration, pointing to agreements signed by Cryptsy and Vernon. But in early June, Judge Kenneth Marra shot down the startup's request to compel arbitration and stay pre-trial discovery. Less than two weeks later, Coinbase appealed the decision before the US Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.  New court documents show that Coinbase's lawyers asked for a delay ahead of a July 24 deadline for Coinbase's appellate brief – which lays out its arguments in the appeal – citing work on other cases.  That request was formally approved on July 12, advancing that deadline to August 23.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Coinbase.

The bitcoin community was abuzz yesterday when, during an appearance before a Congressional committee by Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, an attendee held aloft a ""buy bitcoin"" sign. The image of the sign quickly went viral, though the attendee and his friend were ultimately asked to leave by a staffer.  Soon after his appearance, it emerged that the individual is a friend of a cryptocurrency trader who tweets under the handle CryptoEthan. He posted a picture of the person – soon known as the ""Bitcoin Sign Guy"" – who, in addition to holding up the now-infamous sign, shared a bitcoin address as well.  As of press time, that address has garnered 6.32570673 BTC, an amount worth just under $15,000 at current prices. While most of the transactions involved, numbering 556 according to Blockchain.info, were small in scale, one notable contribution was for 1 BTC.  The photo that included the address was ultimately deleted at the Bitcoin Sign Guy's request, though he later visited the nonprofit advocacy group Coin Center, which is headquartered in Washington, DC.  The viral activity spurred several scam attempts, with some accounts posting Photoshopped versions of the original picture with new addresses.

42379595,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8GmGL,1499961610,Goldman Sachs Granted 'SETLcoin' Cryptocurrency Patent,"Investment bank Goldman Sachs has been awarded a patent for its proposed ""SETLcoin"" cryptocurrency settlement system.  The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) published Goldman's patent on July 11, entitled ""Cryptographic currency for securities settlement"". The bank made headlines when the existence of the patent application was revealed in late 2015.  The concept envisions a system for settling securities trades using a built-in cryptocurrency. When filed in December of that year, the application notably outlined methods for exchanging SETLcoins for digitized stocks for firms like Google and Microsoft, as well as cryptocurrencies, naming bitcoin and litecoin in particular.  Here's how Goldman describes the system:  ""[A] SETLcoin wallet can house a single security or multiple denominations of the same security (e.g., 1 IBM-S SETLcoin valued at 100 IBM shares). SETLcoin wallets may also house multiple securities (e.g., 1 IBM-S SETLcoin and 2 GOOG-S SETLcoins). For example, a single IBM-S SETLcoin may be exchangeable for one or more ""GOOG"" SETLcoins (i.e., Google shares), for 13,000 USD SETLcoins, 100 litecoins, and/or for 5 bitcoins.""  Goldman's patent application was initially filed in October 2014. Paul Walker, co-head of the bank's technology division, and Phil Venables, chief information risk officer for Goldman, are listed as inventors.  A representative for Goldman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

42379593,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Gm8n,1499958326,Beyond Segwit2x: Paul Sztorc Thinks Bitcoin Needs a New Scaling Roadmap,"As bitcoin approaches a particularly tense and uncertain period, it might seem like a strange time to map out the cryptocurrency's future at all.  Eyes are glued on two competing scaling projects aimed at boosting bitcoin's transaction capacity, which are set to come to a head at the end of the month. The best case? Bitcoin could see a smooth capacity increase. The worst? Bitcoin could split into two networks and competing assets.  Yet, that isn't stopping developers from stepping back from the current quagmire to look at the longer term technical picture and how bitcoin could be improved over the next few years. In fact, most bitcoin developers don't seem interested in the debate at all, focusing instead on a range of other forward-looking projects.  One example of this long-range focus came Tuesday when developer Paul Sztorc proposed a new scaling roadmap to a popular bitcoin mailing list, charting out an admittedly rough path for future bitcoin development.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Sztorc stressed the roadmap is very far from official as it’s ""just one man’s work."" He even admitted to not agreeing with all of his own roadmap's contents.  But, he wanted to open up a conversation about what experts think bitcoin's next steps are.  Starting point  To begin, Sztorc's new roadmap continues to include Segregated Witness (SegWit), the code optimization at the center of bitcoin's scaling debate, but also outlines a timeline for the Lightning Network, transaction compression and Schnorr signatures.  The Lightning Network Network could help to increase capacity by allowing transactions to be made without being broadcast to the entire network. Sztorc argued it's complete, except the implementation still needs SegWit to activate to function best.  Schnorr signatures could shrink the size of transactions, further boosting bitcoin's limited capacity. Sztorc put down a tentative deadline of Q4 of 2016.  The roadmap also includes his own proposal, Drivechain. A sidechain proposal, Drivechain acts as a two-way peg, allowing participants to move their bitcoins to a sidechain while remaining a part of the bitcoin network. The goal is that it will not negatively affect the main network while enabling it to host other assets, but there's been some discussion about whether this is possible.  While Sztorc admits to be campaigning for his proposal (and also a distinction between ""scalability"" and ""capacity""), and a few developers have given the idea their blessing.  ""Maybe everyone will hate it. I don't know,"" Sztorc told CoinDesk.  'Harming progress'?  Overall, Sztorc's goal is to refresh an older roadmap.  In December 2015, Blockstream CTO and Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell wrote an email to a popular bitcoin developer list outlining various promising methods of boosting transaction capacity.  You could argue that it spread to become bitcoin's de-facto scaling roadmap, as many users and those in the technical community often link to it as an informal guide.  But, in Sztorc's opinion, it's age is starting to show; many of the changes Maxwell outlined have since been pushed through.  He told CoinDesk:  ""People still talk about it as if it’s important. But it’s pretty old. Parts of it aren’t even right. It’s just obsolete.""    The idea of a new plan sounds innocuous enough, right? Yet, some Bitcoin Core contributors responded to Sztorc's proposal with reluctance, making it clear they believe the original roadmap did more harm than good.    Maxwell, author of the old roadmap, remarked that he wished he had not posted it at all, going as far as to argue that it ""harmed progress in our community.""  ""What I wrote was carefully constructed as a personal view of how things might work out. It never claimed to be a project roadmap,"" he said.  Maxwell detailed reasons for opposing Sztorc's proposal, namely that many of the technologies listed are not far enough along for developers to have a clear idea of whether they are reasonable to promote.  Bitcoin Core contributor Bryan Bishop was also hesitant to support a new roadmap for the same reason Maxwell does in that the deadlines provided could be construed as solid and agreed upon, leading to confusion. This is especially important, he continued, because Maxwell's original roadmap has been used to distort Bitcoin Core’s point of view.  ""I think it's very quick to reach the point of unethical to advocate a perspective that there's guarantee [that] things will happen according to that timeline,"" Bishop wrote.  Toward clarity  Still, Sztorc suggests the new roadmap is needed because Bitcoin Core developers are not sufficiently communicating with the outside world about which technical proposals they support.  Communication has long been perceived an issue in the community, especially given that technical changes to bitcoin are often complex and difficult to understand. Some even argue miscommunication between various stakeholders has contributed to bitcoin's current state, with users supporting competing scaling proposals that could lead to a split of the network.  Of course, Bitcoin Core is a loose group, composed of open-source developers who each have their own opinions and often disagree on technical issues. Yet, as is the case with Segregated Witness (a technical optimization at the heart of bitcoin's current debate), developers sometimes do share similar views about the best way forward.  According to Sztorc, Maxwell's roadmap highlighted where there was consensus from experts. He believes his new roadmap is much like that. While the ideas might not be ready for primetime yet, they are all ideas prominent developers are working on today.  ""There should be clarity,"" he said, arguing a new roadmap might achieve that.  Although, he stressed the proposal is by no means complete. He invited suggestions, rewrites or even several competing roadmaps highlighting expert's visions.  Sztorc concluded:  ""It would be better than what we have now, which is a tangled mess of random social media commentary. I don't think that really works at all.""

42379597,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8GmCZ,1499950813,The State of ICO Regulation? New Report Outlines Legal Status in 6 Nations,"Fintech analyst and research firm Autonomous NEXT has published a new report on the state of blockchain-based initial coin offerings (ICOs).  Released today and entitled ""Token Mania,"" the 70-page publication takes a unique look at the regulatory and operational challenges the novel fundraising model, which is fast becoming the main capital driver in the sector, poses for business and investors.  ""We try to give folks that may be deep in financial services, but not deep in the crypto economy, a primer,"" said Lex Sokolin, the firm's global director of fintech strategy, on the report, though he acknowledged it is not intended to provide legal advice.  Overall, the report singles out six different countries – Switzerland, Singapore, Russia, China, the U.K. and the U.S. – to highlight the state of play for ICOs and cryptocurrencies more generally.  Market leaders  Perhaps most notably, the report considers Switzerland and Singapore to be two of the more advanced nations for creating welcoming environments for fintech and cryptocurrencies. Notably, the two countries have agreed to cooperate on fintech rules.  In Switzerland, business is regulated by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, or FINMA, but cryptocurrency companies do not require any specific approval or license, the report finds. Under the law, cryptocurrencies are assets rather than securities.  Similarly, cryptocurrencies are assets in Singapore rather than funding or payment instruments according to the regulator, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). The authority does not regulate virtual currency transactions, but does monitor KYC and AML, the report states.  ""Switzerland is relevant because exchanges and firms are moving there, they're jurisdiction shopping,"" Sokolin explained, adding:  “Singapore is in a similar position because it's favorable to token launches and companies that focus on cryptocurrency.""  This is not to say the regulators aren't keeping an eye on things.  This week the Swiss government said it's working on rules for cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, in Singapore, there is ongoing development of a Proposed Payment Framework (PPF) that would review existing payments and remittance regulations, and this would include virtual currency intermediaries.  Mixed scenes  Other countries were viewed as less welcoming by the report.  In particular, Autonomous NEXT singled out the U.K. and the U.S. as jurisdictions with high activity, but a lack of legal clarity.  ""We looked at the U.K. and U.S. because there's quite a bit of blockchain activity at the enterprise level and the consortium level, but there's not much clarity around the crypto economy,"" said Sokolin.  The UK, like Singapore, has a regulatory sandbox to help test out new financial projects. As a result of that, the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is taking a wait-and-see approach to distributed ledger technology, according to the report.  As it stands, cryptocurrency and tokens are considered ""private currency,"" and as for ICOs specifically, issuers are operating on their own interpretation of the law. The FCA has published a broad paper on DLT and crypto tokens, but this is not binding, so the landscape for ICOs in the U.K. could very well change in the near future.  The U.S. meanwhile was described as having an ""alphabet soup of regulators"" that makes issuing tokens more complex. Then there's also the individual 50 states that implement their own rules, such as the so called ""BitLicense"" in New York, and Delaware, the ""home of American incorporation"", which has introduced a variety of blockchain-related legislation.  Sokolin told CoinDesk that the complex regulatory environment in the U.S. means less experimentation is ongoing domestically:  ""You see a bunch of countries working on passporting between these fintech sandboxes, where you can experiment and try things out. In the U.S., there's an OCC fintech charter, but it's for banks and it's not yet implemented.""  Tension elsewhere  Also examined is China, which is fast emerging as one of the more active countries for cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation.  There, the report outlines how the People's Bank of China (PBoC), the country's central bank, has established a digital currency research institute that provides assistance to startups and projects. Tokens there are considered a non-monetary digital asset, according to the paper.  It goes on to outline how China has its own plans to introduce a fintech sandbox, but that ICOs more generally are unregulated.  According to the Autonomous NEXT report, more than 2 million people have taken part in ICOs in China, while the PBoC is considering regulations to address the perceived high risk and to monitor ""non-professional investors.""  ""The population is more connected into it,"" explained Sokolin, adding:  ""Through our network we've heard that social media advertising of ICOs is much more prevalent than it is in the Western world. It's a different investing climate. It's not the investing climate in the U.S. where people really think of this as the Wild West.""  The Chinese government appears to be open to the crypto economy in some ways, but regulatory attention from government may create tension.  ""We don't see an outcome there yet – meaning it could go any direction – but there is a lot of tension in the system,"" said Sokolin.  Russia, on the other hand, has not been very welcoming to cryptocurrencies with authorities likely to categorize crypto-tokens as legal financial instruments or derivatives in the future. If the government hands down a more formal recognition of cryptocurrencies, they will be subject to KYC and AML regulations, transaction monitoring, and taxes, the report states.  That is not to say the regulators themselves have been averse to the technology. The full report, for example, gives an overview for how the Bank of Russia is moving on its own distributed ledger projects.  For more information, you can download the full report here.

42379592,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Gm1F,1499943603,Symbiont Demos Blockchain Share Issuance for DC Lawmakers,"Blockchain solutions provider Symbiont gave a public demonstration of its distributed ledger solutions at a Washington, DC, event on Tuesday.  There, founder and CEO Mark Smith gave a preview of how its Symbiont Assembly platform could be used for private equity issuance, highlighting how he believes its products, and their underlying technology, have the potential to transform how private corporations in the US are governed.  As such, it was one of the more notable events during a busy Congressional Blockchain Education Day, an event put on by the non-profit Chamber of Digital Commerce as a way of introducing more lawmakers to the technology and its potential to reshape industries.  The Symbiont application is notable as it was developed alongside regulators, specifically those backing a new Delaware law that could soon legalize the use of blockchain technologies as a means to store and transfer securities records. Introduced in May, the bill has been approved by lawmakers in both House and Senate, and is expected to become law after a signature from the state's governor.  Within this context, Smith highlighted how the product could be used to issue and register shares of stock, allow for shareholders to proxy vote on corporate decisions and enable them to view previous transactions and share issuances through the company's capitalization table.  In the demo, Smith highlighted the speed and utility of the platform by recording a congressional staffer's data on the blockchain, and then issuing him shares of a mock corporation along with the necessary certification.  Smith told the audience:  ""This would take traditionally days – weeks – to get this done, and we're doing it in real time.""  Shareholder democracy  The decentralized nature of the application means that no single entity has control over how votes are counted and ensures that all relevant parties – whether they be investors, administrators or regulators – have real-time access to a company's current cap table, as well as previous share issuance transactions.  Symbiont said that the tool has the ability to dramatically improve corporate governance by giving shareholders more say and injecting greater transparency into how decisions are made.  Ron Papanek, managing director at Symbiont, went on to highlight that the smart contracts in use will not proceed with the issuance of new shares – thereby diluting the value of existing shares – without sufficient approval from current shareholders.  He emphasized that legacy proxy voting systems are overly dependent on the company collating and tallying the votes, and pointed to several recent occurrences where votes were discovered to have been miscounted.  Papanek explained:  ""You're trusting the company that potentially is in need of excess capital to accurately count the votes. You're trusting one party to have a fair collection of all that information with no record of what those votes actually were.""  Symbiont's application seeks to solve this problem through decentralization, whereby each node – whether a shareholder, administrator or regulator – operates the software and verifies transactions independently of one another.  ""We're not trusting the corporation for record keeping, we're trusting the software to validate all transactions, and consequently, all parties can trust the veracity of that data,"" said Papanek.  In a nod to practicing what it preaches, Symbiont said it will transfer its securities and equity records over to the platform as soon as it is able to.  ""We're going to be among the first to convert. We're going to eat our own dog food,"" said Caitlin Long, the startup's president and chairman.  'Ready for deployment'  Symbiont claimed that the application is fully functional and ready to be commercially deployed. Further, it said there are several prospective clients waiting in the wings to begin utilizing it once the Delaware legal framework is firmly in place.  However, the company sees the range of potential use cases for its application expanding well beyond the tiny mid-Atlantic state, which is a preferred corporate domicile and home to 85 percent of all initial public offerings (IPOs) listed in the U.S.  Through a relationship with alternative asset platform Private Market, Symbiont will also be offering the application to non-U.S. companies.  Long explained:  ""We built this for more than just our U.S.-registered Delaware corporate client base, it's also applicable to companies outside of the U.S.""  Other use cases in the works include loan syndication and the archiving of public records.  ""We've built our smart contract platform specifically for financial services to the enterprise requirements of the largest financial institutions,"" said Papanek. ""By meeting those needs, we’re opening up the opportunity for other industries to use the same underlying technology.""

42379601,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8GmK7,1499938584,$232 Million: Tezos Blockchain Project Finishes Record-Setting Token Sale,"The Tezos blockchain project has completed its initial coin offering, or ICO, bringing in a record-smashing $232m-worth of bitcoin and ether.  At close, Tezos had netted 65,627 BTC (worth roughly $156m at current prices) and 361,122 ETH (worth about $76m). The crowdsale, which didn't have a cap on the total amount of tokens sold, began on July 1, and was timed with the passage of 2,000 transaction blocks on the bitcoin network.  The total represents the most collected via an ICO to date, topping the amount raised by Bancor, a platform for launching new blockchain tokens, which raised $150m at then-current prices in mid-June.  At its heart, Tezos tackles the question of governance and development in the context of a decentralized network composed of different entities with possibly varying incentives and goals. The project has been described in the past as a ""self-amending"" blockchain, given that one of its central concepts is the ability for network-wide changes to be decided upon at the protocol level by stakeholders.  In a conversation with CoinDesk earlier this year, Tezos co-founder and technology chief Arthur Breitman explained that those mechanics would act as a kind of ""rule of law"" that could work to prevent conflicts like the ethereum blockchain split following the collapse of the smart-contract funding vehicle The DAO last summer.  He told CoinDesk in February:  ""What we're trying to bring, in some sense, is a rule of law that is, OK, if we have to have these changes because the network needs to evolve, at least we need to have a clear, decentralized procedure for making those changes.""  When launched, Tezos will support smart contracts, using proof-of-stake as a consensus algorithm. With proof-of-stake, validators essentially set aside a portion of their tokens to increase their chances of being chosen to create the next block of transactions.  The team  Tezos, co-founded by Breitman and his wife, Kathleen, has been in development since mid-2014, when the project's white paper and position paper were first published.  Kathleen, who is CEO of the project, previously worked as senior strategy associate for distributed ledger startup R3CEV, according to her LinkedIn profile, a role she took after spending close to two years with professional services firm Accenture.  Arthur, per LinkedIn, served as a vice president for Morgan Stanley between 2013 and 2016, working as a portfolio manager for New York-based family office White Bay Group before that.  Supporting the project is the Tezos Foundation, which is based in the city of Zug, Switzerland. The group is one of a number of blockchain-focused entities to make their home in Zug, which has emerged as a hub for the industry within Europe.  According to an overview for the Tezos crowdsale, the foundation – distinct from Dynamic Ledger Solutions, the startup that developed the project – will help drive activity at the community level, organizing meetups around the world and hosting an online forum for discussion.  Bets on blockchain protocols  In some ways, the success of the Tezos fundraise points to the willingness on the part of investors and speculators to throw their support behind, not only specific applications like Status or Brave, but whole new protocols as well.  Indeed, it was the crowdsale for ethereum – itself a new kind of blockchain at the time of its appearance – that represented one of those early bets. Ethereum's ICO brought in about $18m at then-current bitcoin prices and, today, the network's total market capitalization sits around $20bn.  Another protocol-oriented ICO, for blockchain project EOS, has sold 224m tokens to date through a year-long crowdsale that began in June.  In the case of Tezos, venture capitalists and other notable backers attracted to the project include Tim Draper, who, as Reuters reported in May, was revealed to be backing the Tezos ICO, his first. Draper also invested an undisclosed sum in Dynamic Ledger Solutions.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Brave.  Update: This report has been amended with updated figures from the Tezos crowdsale.

42379590,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Gm7X,1499929207,European Banks Launch DLT Startup for Small Businesses,"A group of major European financial institutions has jointly formed a post-trade blockchain startup designed specifically for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).  According to an announcement, the banks involved created a partnership back in June 2016 to develop a post-trade infrastructure based on distributed ledger technology. That agreement has now resulted in the launch of the new startup, dubbed LiquidShare, which is aimed to give SMEs more access to capital markets and reduce post-trade transaction costs while bringing added security and transparency.  The shareholders who will provide financial support for the endeavor include European investment banks BNP Paribas, Caisse des Dépôts, Euroclear, Société Générale, S2IEM and CACEIS, as well as the pan-European stock exchange Euronext.  A cast of familiar names, most participants have already demonstrated an ongoing interest and involvement in blockchain development.  BNP Paribas Securities Services  , a subsidiary of BNP Paribas, for example, is reported to have developed a fund-distribution platform using blockchain technology with investment manager AXA. Also, earlier this year, Euroclear announced the expansion of its blockchain-based gold trading platform, which could see a full launch later this year.  The former head of global transaction banking at Deutsch Bank in France, Thibaud de Maintenant, has been named as the head of LiquidShare. Joining him as the chairman of the supervisory board will be Anthony Attia, a managing board member of Euronext.
