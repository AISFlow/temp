42385968,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBPZf5,1613861620,Bitcoin's Rise Should Make Regulators Ask if the Fed's Policies Have a Hand in It: WaPo,"The U.S. Federal Reserve and regulators should examine the consequences of their fiscal and monetary policies, including the resulting shortage of suitable investments that has led some to put their money into ""speculative"" ventures such as bitcoin, the Washington Post said in an editorial Saturday.    While dismissing the possibility of bitcoin displacing the U.S. dollar's reserve status, at least for now, for policy makers, ""the best reason to focus on bitcoin’s rise is what it tells us about the risks that may be bubbling up amid the Federal Reserve’s commitment to zero interest rates,"" the newspaper's editorial board said.  While calling the Fed justified for trying to boost the pandemic-afflicted economy by encouraging investors to put their funds in job-creating activities instead of parking it in banks or government bonds, the lack of suitable investment opportunities has driven many to chase yield via ""speculative vehicles - bitcoin very much included,"" the newspaper said.  The Post quoted Tesla CEO Elon Musk's tweet from Friday: “When fiat currency has negative real interest, only a fool wouldn’t look elsewhere.” Musk was talking about why his company had invested $1.5 billion of its treasury funds into bitcoin. (Notably, the Post didn't address the second half of Musk's Tweet. ""Bitcoin is almost as BS as fiat money. The key word is ""almost."")  The Post concluded by appealing to new U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to look at the markets for how those policies are playing out: ""We urge her and other regulators to heed what these markets reveal about the real-world consequences of current monetary and fiscal policy – positive and negative, intended and unintended.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Kevin Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/20/bitcoins-rise-should-make-regulators-ask-if-the-feds-policies-have-a-hand-in-it-wapo,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cf50fd1dc7ec1bc3afd80839e8bc2aca0567a178-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385975,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBPZmd,1613832398,"Bitcoin Crosses $57K, Setting Another All-Time High and Igniting a Crypto Rally","A day after the leading cryptocurrency rose more than $5,000 and along the way achieved a $1 trillion market cap, bitcoin (BTC) on Saturday morning set yet another all-time high, crossing $57,000 for the first time and sparking a broad rally among other cryptocurrencies.    The price of BTC reached a high of $57,492.00 before settling back to $57,264,55, up 8.77% over the last 24 hours. Before yesterday's fun and games started, BTC was at about $51,600.  BTC ended 2020 at bit shy of $29,000 following a better-than 300% gain over the previous 12 months. Now, that eye-popping performance is starting to look tame as less than two months into 2021, BTC has nearly doubled, with a 95.4% gain.  Some are attributing the astonishing rise of BTC's price to the tremendous demand from buyers looking to hedge against inflation as governments keep spending and central banks keep printing money trying to keep their economies going through the pandemic.  “Through the insatiable buy-side pressure from exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers, closed-end funds and large public corporations adding bitcoin to their positions, demand is massively outstripping supply,” said John Willock, chief executive at digital asset exchange Blocktane.  The current ramp-up in the price of BTC was ignited earlier in the month by Tesla, when the electric-automobile manufacturer announced it had purchased $1.5 billion of the cryptocurrency for its treasury. This sparked a round of playing ""who's next?"" in terms of investing treasury funds in BTC and the resulting hype helped focus the attention of main street investors on the sector overall.  Rising along with BTC has been ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum blockchain. Late Friday night New York time, long after most of the action in BTC had died down for the moment, the price of ETH set a new all-time high of its own, crossing the $2,000 mark for the first time ever.  The excitement over BTC and ETH both hitting new peaks has now spread now to the rest of the crypto, with almost all tokens up Saturday morning and a number of them posting double-digit percentage gains.  Major advancers include: Polkadot (DOT), Cardano (ADA), Uniswap (UNI), Aave (AAVE), NEM (XEM) and Huobi Token (HT) . Still others such as Chainlink (LINK) hit all-time highs of their own.  While the gains in UNI and AAVE seem linked because both are major players in the exploding decentralized finance (DeFi) section of the crypto world, most of Saturday's gains may simply be due to investors looking for the next BTC or ETH or because advocates of certain tokens are out there in the chatrooms telling anyone who will listen that their coins will be the next ones to take off.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH | UNI,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | UNI,Kevin Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/20/bitcoin-crosses-57k-setting-another-all-time-high-and-igniting-a-crypto-rally,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/23caa14aa90eea0e21b782e0fbc9ec080a0fc93b-1456x934.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Liquidator Grant Thornton New Zealand said it hadn't authorized the movement of funds and that it is investigating the incident, according to an email seen by Stuff.  Stakenet had not lost funds in the 2019 hack and had been hoping to eventually receive all its assets back.  “If this unauthorized transaction has happened under Grant Thornton’s watch then they need to explain to the users why they failed to secure ... [the] assets like they were supposed to do and how someone was able to access them,” the company told Stuff.

42385976,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBPZrf,1613794084,"Ether Sets New All-Time High Over $2,000 as Bull Run Continues","Ether's price has surged past $2,000 as the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain continues its yearlong bull run.      According to CoinDesk 20 data, ether hit a new record price of $2,033.08, up 6.18% in the last 24 hours, with the market capitalization of the crypto reaching $233.3 billion. The cryptocurrency is up 172.5% year-to-date.      While the price of ether hitting $2,000 would normally be a stop-the-presses-type event, it almost certainly will be overshadowed by the numerous milestones reached hours before by larger sibling bitcoin, including hitting a $1 trillion market value for the first time and rising almost $5,000 in a 24-hour period.      But ether's rising price and surging popularity should not be overlooked. At least three growing areas of demand are fueling the increase in ether’s price: decentralized finance (DeFi), Ethereum 2.0 staking and a newly formed institutionally focused ether market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).    Explaining ether's price rise    Often compared to oil, ether powers interactions on the Ethereum blockchain which is best known for hosting a variety of DeFi apps such as lending, trading and prediction markets. Ethereum-based applications create a natural utility for ether as the cryptocurrency is required to settle transactions. DeFi coins have followed in lockstep with ether as shown by the DeFi Pulse Index (DPI), up 83% in the last 30 days, according to Index Coop.    See also: Valid Points: How CME Ether Futures Work and Why They Matter    Staking on the Ethereum 2.0 network is also creating a supply shock of supports for the digital asset. Eth 2.0 is an in-progress redesign of the Ethereum network based on a new consensus mechanism called proof-of-stake (PoS) and database sharding. Some 2.7% of ether worth $6 billion has been deposited on the Eth 2.0 blockchain. Those funds are further locked for roughly the next 12 months.      Lastly, large investors such as investment funds may be interested in gaining some exposure to the cryptocurrency. CME launched cash-settled futures contracts for the digital asset on Feb. 8. The contracts surpassed $160 billion in aggregated volume within the first week.
