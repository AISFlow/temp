Bitcoin, the largest and original cryptocurrency, tumbled 7% to about $26,900, after earlier in the day dropping close to $25,000, the lowest since June.  Some $821 million of long positions – traders who bet on prices to rise – were wiped out during the rush to the exits, CoinGlass shows. Bitcoin (BTC) traders took the brunt of the losses, enduring $472 million of long liquidations, followed by ether (ETH) with $302 million.  This was the largest level of BTC liquidations for a single day since June 2022, Coinalyze data shows, around the time when the leading crypto's price plummeted to $17,000.  The liquidations occurred as crypto prices fell through the floor during Thursday afternoon U.S. hours turning this month's slow downtrend into a bloodbath amid financial markets jitters with crumbling foreign currencies, Chinese economic worries and bond yields ripping to multi-year highs. Crypto majors such as BTC and ETH saw near double-digit losses, falling to lowest since early summer.

16164931,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=547736,1692313248,Why Is Dogecoin Price Down Today?,"The Dogecoin price is down around 5% in the last day following the general market crash. The meme coin which had seen improved sentiment did a quick 180 and started to bleed. However, while the Dogecoin price could only be following Bitcoin’s descent, are there other factors driving the decline? Why Is Dogecoin Price Falling? One reason that the Dogecoin price is down today is due to its proximity to Shiba Inu. The latter saw a highly anticipated Shibarium launch go awry on Wednesday, sparking rapid declines among the meme coins in its ecosystem. Related Reading: Can Ethereum Price Cross $2,000 Before The End Of August? As a result of this unfortunate event, the price of SHIB fell almost 10% in a matter of hours and this seemed to have spilled over to Dogecoin. Dogecoin, being a meme coin and the largest competitor for Shiba Inu, was expected to rally if SHIB had gone up as a result of the Shibarium launch. There is also the issue of competition expected between Dogechain and Shibarium, further fueling this correlation. The problem with such correlations is that they tend to follow the same negative, as well as positive, path. Given this, when the price of Shiba Inu started to fall, Dogecoin followed suit with the expectations that both of these assets would go in the same direction. DOGE price falls alongside SHIB in volatile market conditions | Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview.com Additionally, DOGE, being one of the top 10 largest-crypto in the space, often tracks the performance of Bitcoin quite closely. So as Bitcoin declined off the back of the FOMC meeting, Dogecoin was hit with a double-decker bus, plunging it deep into the red territory. Can DOGE Price Recover From Here? It is not all bad news for Dogecoin according to crypto analyst “Tony The Bull.” In a recent analysis, he points out that DOGE had tagged the 1-month parabolic SAR. Now, this is notable because the last time the meme coin touched this level was back in 2021. DOGE tags 1M Parabolic SAR | Source: Tony The Bull on X The result of this was that DOGE’s price went from $0.0018 to over $0.7. This translated to an over 24,000% increase at the time. So it stands to reason that if the altcoin is tagging this 1M parabolic SAR again, then there could be a rally in the near future. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Price Crash Similarly To 2019 And 2020? However, it is unlikely that the price of DOGE will actually rise more than $50 at this level. This is because the crypto market is still in peak bear season while 2021 was peak bull season. Nevertheless, a rally toward $0.09 is not out of the question.

16163231,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=547727,1692309635,Will Bitcoin Volatility Continue? These Metrics Say Yes,"Bitcoin has observed some sharp price action today, and if data of these metrics is to go by, the asset may not be done being volatile just yet. Bitcoin’s Open Interest And Leverage Ratio Have Remained High As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, some metrics are forming a pattern that can lead to more volatility in the cryptocurrency’s price. These indicators are the open interest and the estimated leverage ratio. The “open interest” refers to the total amount of Bitcoin futures contracts that are open on all derivative exchanges. An increase in this metric suggests that the investors are opening more positions on the futures market right now, while a decrease implies some of them are closing their positions, or are getting liquidated. The other metric of interest here, the “estimated leverage ratio,” keeps track of the ratio between the open interest and the derivative exchange reserve (that is, the total amount of Bitcoin sitting in the wallets of these derivative platforms). What this metric tells us is the amount of leverage that futures users are opting for on average. High leverage can significantly increase the risk of a large number of contracts being liquidated, so whenever this metric has a high value, the market can become more probable to show high volatility due to violent liquidation events. Related Reading: Bitcoin Plunges To $28,500, Will This Historical Support Hold Again? Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in these two Bitcoin indicators over the past few days: Looks like both these metrics have observed high values in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin open interest and estimated leverage ratio had both been at relatively high values right before the plunge that the asset saw in the past 24 hours. In this sharp price plummet, the futures market naturally observed a high amount of liquidations, leading to the open interest registering some decrease. The metric, however, didn’t actually see that much of a cool down despite these liquidations, and it has now already reached back to the same levels it was at before the volatility. This would suggest that the futures market users have opened new positions since the mass liquidation event. While the open interest had gone down in this event, albeit briefly, the leverage ratio actually hadn’t budged even that much. Related Reading: Are Bitcoin Whales Selling? This Metric May Suggest So Rather, the indicator has only been going up, implying that the users opening up the new futures contracts are only opting for higher and higher amounts of leverage. Because of the open interest rebounding and the leverage ratio only trending higher, it would appear like a reasonable possibility that the Bitcoin price would observe more volatility in the near future. Such volatility can take the coin in either direction, but generally, the side of the market with the less amount of contracts is the more probable one. In the chart, the data for the “funding rates” is attached, which basically tells us whether the longs or the shorts are dominant in the futures market currently. The funding rates had been positive in the latest futures market overheat, as well as in the one seen earlier in the month, but following today’s long liquidations, the metric has turned negative. This may suggest that a liquidation event involving the shorts is more likely to happen next. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $28,500, down 3% in the last week.

Tornado Cash is an actual entity in itself, which has a property interest in its smart contracts, wrote Judge Robert Pitman, from the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, on Thursday.  The judge found an argument that Tornado Cash is not an actual entity unconvincing, writing that the Treasury Department did make sure to designate an entity, which includes the decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, that governs the mixer.  ""The DAO is an entity unto itself that, through its voting members, has demonstrated an agreement to a common purpose. As the government notes, the structure is not unlike that of stockholders of a corporation who may not intend to vote in a shareholder meeting, without this affecting the structure of the entity,"" he wrote.  He rejected other arguments from the plaintiffs, including one which said Tornado Cash doesn't have a property right in the actual smart contracts being designated and an argument that the sanctions violated the First Amendment.  The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) sanctioned Tornado Cash last year, alleging it was a key tool used by malicious actors like North Korea's Lazarus Group to launder crypto funds stolen from decentralized exchanges and games like Axie Infinity.  The move drew an immediate rebuke from the crypto industry, with Coin Center filing its own lawsuit roughly a month after the Coinbase-backed suit.  Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal said on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the company would support an appeal.  In a statement shared Friday, a Treasury spokesperson said the department was pleased with the ruling.  ""We are pleased with the Texas District Court’s opinion upholding Treasury’s vital work protecting U.S. national security. At a time when North Korea is increasing its reliance on virtual currency heists and other cybercrime, it’s critical to continue disrupting the regime’s ability to generate revenue for its ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction programs,"" she said.

16159719,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=547709,1692302429,Bitcoin Faces A Weekly Double Top; This Needs To Happen,"In a recent analysis of the Bitcoin price, seasoned crypto analyst Rekt Capital discussed the looming presence of a potential double top formation on the weekly chart. The scenario paints a picture of impending volatility, with both bullish and bearish narratives emerging from this often foreboding pattern. “The BTC Double Top still remains intact,” tweeted Rekt Capital, emphasizing the technical structure’s significance. He continues, “Weekly Bearish Divergence lends additional bearish confluence to this structure as well. More, the bear div is developing a new lower high (dotted green) relative to its primary downtrend (solid green).” However, BTC would need to drop an additional -9% to -13% from current prices to complete its potential double top. But what makes this analysis particularly intriguing is the current state of Bitcoin’s volume. Rekt Capital further observes, “What’s interesting about the volume behind BTC’s price action is that the two recent peaks formed on inclining volume while the RSI formed lower highs.” For many, this simultaneous increase in volume with descending RSI hints at underlying market weakness, an insight further supported by the subsequent declining volume after the local top at approximately $31,000. Related Reading: Early Signs Of Life: Why Bitcoin Is Likely To Move Away From $30,000 Soon Diving deeper in his video analysis, Rekt Capital highlighted the need for a distinct “M”-shaped formation, a hallmark of the double top pattern. “For Bitcoin to form a double top here, we have to see an ‘M’-shaped formation take place. When we see a M form, that’s essentially a double top. One top here [at $30,800] and one top here [at $31,300].” Losing pivotal support levels could invite substantial downward movement. “Losing this [neckline] level at $26,000 as support would enable further downside,” warns the analyst. However, for traders and investors hoping for symmetrical behavior, Rekt Capital speculates, “And if we see symmetry here, a three month second part of this M could form so that’s going to prompt further downside and just slow bleeding into that 90 day-mark which would be around next month.” Related Reading: SEC Approval Could Propel Bitcoin To New Heights: Analyst Forecasts $150,000 Clearing Price But not all is bleak. Should Bitcoin trace back to $24,000, a retracement would “see us retest the neckline of this inverse head & shoulders that we saw break out.” Rekt Capital adds, “So a retest of this level as a new support should actually enable further upside.” Also, a look at the 1-week chart also shows that there is another scenario for the invalidation of the double top. Bitcoin has formed an ascending trendline from its low in early January. Provided BTC can hold this trendline on a weekly basis and bounce up from there (at around $28,200), an invalidation would take place. The symmetry of the M would be broken, the uptrend on the higher time frames could continue.

42409943,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcQfTr,1692301548,"The Protocol: Blockchains Keep Launching, From Sei to Shibarium","Past eras of crypto development were marked by a rapid proliferation in protocols for decentralized finance (DeFi) or other purposes, built atop big blockchains like Ethereum. Recently, however, there’s been a mini-explosion in new blockchains, including so-called layer-2 networks built atop Ethereum. The trend is encapsulated in this week’s launch of the Sei network – optimized for speed, and trading applications – as well as the meme-obsessed Shiba Inu crypto community’s new Shibarium blockchain. As documented in The Protocol this week, these launches aren’t always so smooth.  Our feature story by Sage D. Young and yours truly takes a deep dive into “restaking” and a pioneering protocol called EigenLayer – tipped by crypto experts as a potentially explosive technological trend; restaking represents a new way of securing blockchain projects, where it's easy to piggyback off Ethereum’s own security apparatus. There are worries, though, that the practice may take on a life of its own, and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned of the potential for systemic risk. The full story is here.  You're reading The Protocol, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that explores the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Subscribe here to get it every week.  Network news  SEI HELLO! Sei, a new layer-1 blockchain built using Cosmos technology, launched to the public, and its native SEI token garnered more than $1 billion in trading volume after being listed on crypto exchanges including Gate.io and Binance. The project is notable because it was designed as an application-specific blockchain meant for trading, in contrast to more general-purpose networks like Ethereum that could theoretically support a wider range of use cases. Jay Jog, co-founder of Sei Labs, which led the new blockchain’s development, said that the “solution” to providing faster performance of decentralized trading applications was a “fundamental rewrite of the underlying infrastructure.” (Sei Labs raised $30 million in funding in April from big-name backers including Jump Crypto and Multicoin Capital.) After some wild first-day fluctuations, the SEI token had a market capitalization of about $343 million, a touch below the nearly $500 million mark predicted by some traders. The much-anticipated debut was blemished by questions and complaints from early adopters who were expecting an immediate airdrop of rewards tokens; the Sei Foundation, which was coordinating the details, declined Wednesday to provide extra info on the likely timing. After the airdrop actually began, later in the day, the SEI price tumbled 31% as recipients dumped the tokens on the market, while complaints flooded X (fka Twitter) about the scantiness of the allocations.  DOG HOUSE – The Shiba Inu blockchain community, centered around the doggy-themed meme coin SHIB, which in turn was a play on Dogecoin’s DOGE, went live with its new layer-2 blockchain, Shibarium, built atop Ethereum. The goal is to reduce transaction fees for users involved in Shiba Inu ecosystem, but there is also a mechanism to boost the price of the SHIB token. The new blockchain will use BONE tokens as the primary gas token – used to pay fees; and some 70% of base fees will be converted into SHIB tokens and then burned, effectively reducing the supply. But the blockchain’s first day was a bit of a dog’s breakfast, with the SHIB token tumbling 9% as users widely reported troubles bridging assets over to the new blockchain, with transactions on the network stalled for at least five hours. Users were also muzzled from sending messages on a community forum on Discord shortly after the initial reports started coming in.  DIS-CONNECT: Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, shut down Binance Connect, formerly known as Bifinity, just one year after its launch. The service allowed merchants to accept payments in crypto, supporting 50 digital assets and major credit-card networks including Visa and Mastercard. In a statement, Binance said the decision came “in response to changing market and user needs.”  OUTED AS ALTCOINER? Fresh election-finance disclosures revealed that former U.S. President Donald Trump, who is running for the Republican nomination in the 2024 race, held $2.8 million in a cryptocurrency wallet as of early August; the blockchain-analysis firm Arkham Intelligence said it found what appears to be the wallet address, and it contains ether (ETH) along with wrapped ETH (wETH), Polygon’s MATIC tokens and the USDC stablecoin. The revelations are notable partly because other Republican candidates, including Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy, have touted policy positions favorable specifically to bitcoin (BTC), and many bitcoiners tend to frown on usage of anything besides the largest and original cryptocurrency.  ALSO:  Hedera Hashgraph’s HBAR token surged more than 15% after the U.S. Federal Reserve’s instant payments platform FedNow added “Dropp,” a Hedera-based micropayments platform, as a service provider.  The team behind NEAR Protocol, a layer-1 protocol, has paid out some $1.8 million in bounties to “white hat” hackers who identified three code vulnerabilities, including two issues classified as “critical,” according to HackenProof, a website that allows for the submission of such claims.

42409933,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcQfDK,1692299622,Vitalik Buterin Has Thoughts on Social Media Fact Checking,"When Vitalik Buterin calls something “the closest thing to an instantiation of ‘crypto values’...in the mainstream world,” you’ve got to listen. In this case, the Ethereum co-founder was reviewing X’s Community Notes feature (originally called Birdwatch), a crowdsourcing tool for people to add context and rate the truthfulness of posts (RIP tweets) which launched​ back when the platform was called Twitter and before Elon Musk made the worst deal of his life. I’m not sure why VB chose now to write a 4,300-word blog about a pilot program that launched last year, but I’m glad he did.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.     And so was Elon Musk, who retweeted the slightly esoteric example of software criticism — bringing Vitalik’s ideas about decentralization and user autonomy to new heights. It’s funny too because throughout the post, VB was not afraid of laying in to Musk, who is known for running companies like autocracies and was at least at one point the world’s richest man. Despite the fact that Musk, as a boss, basically represents everything crypto would dismantle if it could, he’s yet to dismantle Community Notes like he’s derailed much of what made Twitter special.  For Buterin, Community Notes is a case study in decentralized governance. In short, it’s a Wikipedia-like system that anyone can apply to join that can be written and voted on by anyone, and which is run and ultimately kept in check by an open-source algorithm. Buterin says the machine learning algorithm which surfaces posts is seemingly able to straddle the deep ideological divisions online to surface non-partisan, “impressively useful” and credible information.  “It’s not perfect, but it’s surprisingly close to satisfying the ideal of credible neutrality,” he wrote. Credible neutrality being the term of art used to describe things like blockchains, built to avoid discrimination of all kinds. Since the very beginning the goal for Ethereum, for Buterin, has been credible neutrality: a universally accessible machine that people truly believe is so trustworthy it transcends the category and becomes trustless. So when Buterin sees a Community Note, he can generally trust X isn’t giving him the runaround or information someone paid for him to see.  (Elon Musk, the self-described ""free speech absolutist,"" also painted a picture of Twitter as a haven for all legal forms of speech but has fallen widely off the mark. As many people have already said, Musk's leadership at Twitter/X is like a walking advertisement for crypto, if only because he has shown that ""good intentions"" – if you want to grant him that – are not enough. ""Neutrality"" doesn't have to be hardwired to happen in the real world, but it helps establish credibility when you know an owner-investor can't just change the code on you.)  See also: Crypto Can Help With Elon Musk's Twitter Identity Issue | (2022)  Community Notes is transparent and consensus-driven, but it’s not quite crypto. For instance, VB notes there’s evidence suggesting Musk may have mucked with a corrective note mentioning the Uygher genocide, given his vast business interests in China. Buterin doesn’t come down one way or another on the matter, but he does note after examining and not finding direct evidence in the source code that there are many technical and social ways to game public votes. It’s worth mentioning that crypto hasn’t exactly found a solution to Sybil attacks, brigading or the problem of money in politics.  The tool isn’t only important as a mainstream experiment with digital democracy. It also points to what crypto could be. VB has never been one to bite his tongue when it comes to crypto’s problems, and I’m thankful he never flatout suggested blockchain as a solution for X’s issues. But as a sober analysis of a “very-large-scale” application that will probably be the closest many come to interacting with “crypto values,” VB’s reflections on Community Notes are a reminder that some problems just cannot be solved.  That isn’t even defeatist. Perhaps the most lucid section of the blog is when VB addresses recent commentary suggesting Community Notes is not “brave” enough and doesn’t go far enough to address misinformation. Buterin flat out states that it should not be the goal for systems like these to catch every falsehood or lie. He’d rather see 10 “misinformative tweets go free” than for one to be judged “unfairly.” “The goal,” he writes, “is to remind people that multiple perspectives exist.”  See also: Twitter Is Dead. Long Live Crypto Twitter? | Opinion  Today it’s more common to see attempts to cure the problems of “public epistemology” by presenting expert opinion as the ultimate source of truth — whether that’s the CDC during Covid or Facebook interjecting Snopes-approved facts in a political debate. VB appreciates top down decrees, saying that experts rarely lie (and if they do, it’s usually by leaving facts out, aka a “sin of omission”). He sees Community Notes as a worthwhile experiment in spreading verifiable and credible information in an age of incredulity, but hardly the only solution (ahem, prediction markets).  This is worth bearing in mind in crypto, too. The aim shouldn’t be to solve all the world’s ills. Far too often blockchain projects are looking to disrupt and replace what already exists. It’s not out of the question to think this cockiness can have a negative backlash, feeding the general skepticism around blockchain and people’s anger when things inevitably go wrong — much like how social media fact checking has spurred distrust and the general collapse of the faith in institutions. Hopefully, open, permissionless crypto networks are already built for a world filled with many opinions — but perhaps they should be built for a world with many options, too.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/08/17/vitalik-buterin-has-thoughts-on-social-media-fact-checking,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7c5ccebfbdfa943cbcc9155ea330e539806ad7bb-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Should the SEC win its motion, it can then ask an appeals court for permission file the actual appeal of the ruling.  A Ripple spokesperson didn't have an immediate comment. An SEC spokesperson declined to comment.  Ripple Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty previously said on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, that the company opposed the request.  “There is no extraordinary circumstance here that would justify departing from the rule requiring all issues as to all parties to be resolved before an appeal,” he said.  The price of XRP did not seem to react much to the order itself, though it is down roughly 4% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko.  The SEC has a steep hill to climb in getting approval from Judge Torres, said ConsenSys Senior Counsel and Director of Global Regulatory Matters Bill Hughes.  ""The legal standard is a difficult one to satisfy, and the particulars of this case also do not help SEC's argument in favor of appeal. In fact, the SEC itself has undermined its current arguments for an appeal by previously indicating that a decision in Ripple does not really bear on any other crypto securities lawsuit. It's unlikely that the court will be persuaded by them speaking out of both sides of their mouth,"" he said. ""And even if Judge Torres does grant their motion, they then have another steep mountain to climb – getting the Second Circuit's approval to file an appeal.""  The appeal process itself won't pause the rest of the case, said Dave Rodman, the founder and managing partner of the Rodman Law Group. However, if the SEC wins approval from both Judge Torres and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals to file the appeal, the circuit court may issue a stay on all proceedings until the appeal has been resolved.  ""We think that this cause would probably be stayed given the nature of the determination subject to appeal,"" he told CoinDesk.  Elizabeth Napolitano contributed reporting.  CORRECTION (Aug. 17, 2023, 18:30 UTC): Corrects that if the SEC wins permission from Judge Torres to file an appeal, it must then seek permission from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.

16156275,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=547695,1692295250,Buying The Dip? Shiba Inu Whale Activity Surges As Price Declines Nearly 10%,"Shiba Inu (SHIB), a dog-inspired meme coin, originally dismissed by many as just another fleeting fad, is now drawing serious attention from big players, or “whales,” in the crypto space. This attention comes amid the tokens’ recent sloppy launch of its other project, Shibarium. Blockchain security team Beosin recently reported that the newly deployed Shibarium platform has had transactions stalled in a pending state, tying up approximately 1,003 ether, equivalent to $1.8 million in locked funds. 🚨Transactions on #Shibarium are stuck in a pending state. $1.7M are currently locked on ETH. Users are advised to temporarily stop using shibarium.https://t.co/io5puAibBc https://t.co/q2SXqtthoO — Beosin Alert (@BeosinAlert) August 17, 2023 This sloppy launch has affected the SHIB token negatively seeing the tokens’ price decline by nearly 10% over the past 24 hours. However, despite this plunge whales are reportedly still making moves on Shiba Inu. Related Reading: Shiba Inu’s DeFi Aspirations May Rattle DOGE’s Market As SHIB Turns To Digital IDs Shiba Inu Whale Activity Surges According to Santiment, a prominent blockchain data firm, there has been a noticeable increase in transaction activity by whales across several digital currencies, including SHIB and XRP. 🐳 As the crowd feels the pain, there are several assets seeing an increase in whale activity. As they attempt to capitalize on the discounted prices, read about the four projects we’re seeing some notable activity rises: $SHIB, $XRP, $SAND, & $CAKE https://t.co/SnuKebg7h1 pic.twitter.com/VWKlH95yU0 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) August 17, 2023 Specifically, for Shiba Inu, the numbers are compelling. Santiment’s data shows that there’s been a surge in transfers of SHIB valued at $1 million or higher. According to Santiment, a possible reason for the increase in whale activity could be that these large investors are attempting to “capitalize on discount prices” of Shiba Inu and the other cryptocurrencies recording a surge in whale activity Furthermore, this uptick in activity closely follows significant events in the Shiba Inu ecosystem, particularly the mainnet launch of Shibarium, which could be another contributing factor. Shibarium represents a crucial advancement for the SHIB community and its broader ecosystem. And though its launch didn’t go as planned, its introduction likely plays a role in attracting these large investors and traders to SHIB, looking to capitalize on new opportunities brought about by the platform’s capabilities. SHIB Declines Nearly 10% In The Past Day Over the past 24 hours, Shiba Inu has been in red regardless of the surging whale activity. Particularly, the dog-inspired meme coin has recorded a loss of 9.9% over this period and with a current market price of $0.0000087, at the time of writing. This plunge is also reflected in the asset’s market capitalization which has seen a substantial loss of more than $600 million in the past day. Interestingly, despite the blood bath, Shiba Inu’s daily trading volume has remained resilient. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Dips By 7% Following Shibarium Launch Over the past day, SHIB’s trading volume has hovered above $450 million and currently stands at a value of $461 million at the time of writing.

CBDCs are not cryptocurrencies, but they’re in the same family. They don’t have to be, but they could be based on a blockchain, the ledger technology that powers Bitcoin and the rest of crypto. A CBDC would simply be a digital version of an existing fiat currency like the U.S. dollar, with the imprimatur of the issuing government.  Initial participants in Mastercard’s CBDC Partner Program include Ripple, Fireblocks, and Consensys, the company announced Thursday.  The program is designed to encourage conversations among key players in the industry and “to drive innovation and efficiencies,” Mastercard’s head of digital assets and blockchain, Raj Dhamodharan, said in a statement.  “We believe in payment choice and that interoperability across the different ways of making payments is an essential component of a flourishing economy,” he said. “As we look ahead toward a digitally driven future, it will be essential that the value held as a CBDC is as easy to use as other forms of money.”  Mastercard’s track record of innovating in the digital asset ecosystem, especially the CBDC space, reaches far back. In early 2021, the payments network launched a prepaid card for people in the Bahamas who were looking to use the country’s CBDC, which was the first CBDC.  Most recently, the payments network said that it was setting up a testbed to explore tokenized bank deposits in the U.K., which will move on to include CBDCs and regulated stablecoins in due course.

PYPL price drops to $59 | Source: PayPal Holdings, Inc. on Tradingview.com Ledger Live’s integration with Paypal is indeed a significant step in the financial tech world, as the two giants share a similar vision of creating fast and seamless transactions on a universal scale. Ledger is one of the most notable hardware wallet manufacturers, recording over 6 million Ledger Nano hardware wallet sales all around the world since 2016. Also, Ledger launched its Tradelink service in 2023 that will enable “off-exchange trading, enhanced security, distribution of risk, zero transaction fees, and a more efficient and faster trading” for institutional investors. Paypal’s interest in the crypto world is by no means new. On August 7, Paypal made an announcement to launch its own Ethereum-based stablecoin called PYUSD. However, nothing was said about PYUSD being listed as one of the coins that will be available on the Ledger Live just yet. Related Reading: Executives Of Crypto-Friendly Bank Silvergate Step Down As Lawsuits, Liquidation Rages On PYUSD’s launch has not been smooth either with regulators calling for more oversight following the launch. Last week, US congresswoman Maxine Waters called for federal oversight and enforcement of PayPal after launching the stablecoin. PayPal also revealed plans to allow select customers to purchase cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum using PYUSD. However, amid the new UK regulatory system that will come into play on October 8, Paypal plans to temporarily pause the buying of cryptocurrencies in the country from October 1 to resume crypto services in the Q1 of 2024.

Farmington, which operates under its Moonstone Bank name, “improperly” pivoted to a pro-digital assets business plan in 2022 without notifying, and obtaining approval from, its supervisors, the document said. The joint enforcement action from the Federal Reserve Board and the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions bars the Washington state-based bank from “making dividends or capital distributions, dissipating cash assets and engaging in certain activities” without its supervisors’ permission.  Farmington promised to steer clear of “digital bank operations” and avoid modifying its business plan in an agreement it signed with the Reserve Bank when it became a bank holding company in 2020, the Fed said. The bank worked with a third party, however, to design an IT infrastructure to “facilitate…the issuance of stablecoins” in exchange for 50% of mint and burn fees on certain stablecoins, the Fed alleged.  The one-branch bank long operated as a community lender, eschewing digital assets dealings for traditional financial services. However, the bank changed its plan around the time FTX sister company Alameda Research purchased an $11.5 million stake in the institution last year.

16152599,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=547642,1692287441,"Bitcoin Plunges To $28,500, Will This Historical Support Hold Again?","Bitcoin has plunged toward the $28,500 mark during the past day, which happens to be quite near a historically significant support line. Bitcoin Is Now Near The Short-Term Holder Realized Price As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, BTC’s latest drawdown has brought it near the realized price of the short-term holders. The “realized price” here refers to a metric that’s derived from the “realized cap” model of Bitcoin. The realized cap calculates the total valuation of the asset by assuming that the actual value of any coin in circulation is not the current spot price, but the price at which the coin was last transacted on the chain. Since the last transfer price of any coin is likely to represent its buying price, this model accounts for the prices that each investor in the market bought their coins, and hence, the realized cap may be looked at as a measure of the total capital that holders have put into the cryptocurrency. When this model is divided by the total number of coins in circulation, the average cost basis or acquisition price in the market is obtained. This is precisely what the realized price is. Related Reading: Are Bitcoin Whales Selling? This Metric May Suggest So If the Bitcoin spot price goes below this indicator, it means that the average investor has gone underwater. Similarly, breaks above the metric signify a return to profits for the majority of the market. The realized price can also be defined for specific segments of the market. In the context of the current discussion, one part of the market is of relevance: the “short-term holders” (STHs). Here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin realized price for this cohort: Looks like the value of the metric has approached the price recently | Source: CryptoQuant The STHs include all investors who bought their coins within the last 155 days. The holders that pass beyond this threshold are termed “long-term holders” (LTHs). From the chart, it’s visible that with the latest decline, the Bitcoin spot price has come very close to the STH realized price. This would suggest that these investors as a whole are about breaking even on their investment currently. In the chart, the quant has highlighted how previous retests of this line have gone in this year so far. Interestingly, both back in March and June, the cryptocurrency found support at this metric and observed a sharp rebound. This is a trend that has historically been seen during bullish periods. The reason behind this curious pattern may perhaps be the fact that the STHs look at their cost basis as a profitable point for accumulating more of the asset in such periods, as they believe that the price would only go up in the near future. Related Reading: Bitcoin & Top Assets See High Loss Taking, Is This Bullish? The extraordinary buying pressure at the line may be why the asset finds support at this level as well. This is because the opposite happens during bearish periods, as holders look to escape the market at their break-even point. It now remains to be seen how Bitcoin’s interaction with the STH realized price will go this time around. Naturally, a successful retest would be a positive sign for the rally, as it would show that these investors haven’t yet lost their bullish conviction in the coin. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $28,500, down 3% in the last week.

42409950,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcQfr0,1692287100,How Is Tokenization Impacting Investing?,"One of the many ways blockchain will revolutionize financial services is in the ability to tokenize real-world assets investment. Today we will learn how blockchain technology builds, trades and tracks real-world investment products.  Already we are seeing big firms (BNY Mellon, JP Morgan and BlackRock) tout tokenization projects, recognizing the efficiencies they can bring from a payment and settlement perspective. Still, the more significant potential of tokenized investments is their ability to democratize finance and bring broader investment opportunities to the general population through ""fractionalized"" investments in global opportunities.  As more investment products become tokenized, how will advisors help their clients access these new asset models?  Kelly Ye, head of research at Decentral Park Capital, takes us through tokenization thinking and where it's headed, providing perspective on the activity across the space. And it's a fascinating discussion.  – S.M.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  Tokenization - The New Market Infrastructure to Democratize Alternative Investing  You may not have heard of tokenization, but you have probably heard of exchange-traded funds, or ETFs. Since their inception in 1993, ETFs have surpassed traditional mutual funds as the preferred investment vehicle for many investors to access capital markets. The remarkable growth of the ETF lineup has democratized the investment business, providing access to investment strategies and entire asset classes that were historically only available to the largest and most sophisticated investors.  However, there is still a substantial portion of the investment universe that ETFs cannot reach. Alternative investments, such as private equity, private debt and real assets, are typically available only in the form of private funds with constraints on liquidity, investor qualification, and minimum investment thresholds. According to a 2022 Fidelity study, institutions on average allocate around 23% to alternatives, while advisors only allocate approximately 6%. In an environment where a traditional 60/40 portfolio provides limited growth and income opportunities, alternative investments serve as valuable building blocks to enhance an investor's portfolio.  It would be beneficial to have an ""ETF""-like structure that offers transparency, liquidity, and efficiency to access these alternative investments - this is where blockchain technology can play a significant role through a process called tokenization. Tokenization involves representing real-world assets, such as private equity, real estate, fine art, commodities, and more, as digital tokens on a blockchain. By doing so, these assets become easily tradable and divisible, opening up new possibilities for fractional ownership and liquidity. Advisors can now present clients with a broader array of investment options, encompassing both traditional and digital assets, catering to different risk appetites and financial goals.  Blockchain technology addresses three critical challenges for alternative investing:  Transparency: Blockchain provides a tamper-resistant and immutable record of ownership and transactions on the tokenized asset. The assets and their ownership details are publicly visible on the ledger, enabling stakeholders to verify and track asset movements in real-time. This transparency can help reduce fraud and increase trust among market participants.  Liquidity: Tokenization allows fractional ownership, enhancing liquidity by enabling investors to buy and sell smaller portions of assets, rather than requiring substantial capital to buy an entire asset. These tokenized assets can also be traded on secondary markets 24/7, potentially increasing their overall liquidity.  Efficiency: Tokenization allows for the automation of various processes, including ownership verification, settlement, and compliance. Smart contracts, self-executing contracts on the blockchain, can facilitate the transfer of ownership and automate certain aspects of asset management. This automation can lead to increased efficiency and reduced operational costs.  Once brought on-chain, tokenized assets can participate in the ”DeFi Flywheel” and create more financialization opportunities. For example, tokenized assets can serve as collateral for borrowing, thus improving the capital efficiency of owning these assets.  Large institutions have started testing tokenization. For instance, KKR and Hamilton Lane both launched tokenized private funds in 2022 with Securitize, a fintech firm specialized in tokenization. Franklin Templeton launched a tokenized money market fund in 2021 on the Stellar blockchain, which has gathered more than $270 million as of April 2023 a few months after it also expanded to Polygon. Citigroup has forecasted a $4-5 trillion tokenized digital securities market by 2030 in their March 2023 “Money, Tokens and Games” report.  Despite all the potential benefits of tokenization, we are still at an early stage of development. Current tokenized products are all issued and traded within a walled garden, i.e., on a specific tokenization platform, which hinders wider adoption. Regulatory clarity on the legal status and classification of these tokenized assets is crucial in determining where and how they can be issued and traded. Market infrastructure also needs to be developed to facilitate trading across different platforms. More importantly, investors’ asset allocation model needs to evolve to embrace the possibility of allocating to real world assets. But, just like how ETFs democratized investing, tokenization is both a technological and financial innovation that could democratize alternative investments and open up many more opportunities for end investors to optimize their portfolios.  - Kelly Ye CFA, Head of Research at Decentral Park Capital, board member of CFA New York and committee chair for Women in ETFs.  Ask an Advisor  Q: A client asked about tokenized assets, after hearing Larry Fink and some banks mention them. Can my client use them to invest in assets like wine?  A: Tokenization is likely to become more prevalent in the next decade. It is generally taking a private or public investment, like a private placement in ultra-premium wine, and using blockchain technology to track your ownership.  If your client is able to invest in those placements now, because he/she isn’t accredited, tokenization won’t make them more accessible. However, we will likely see more of these investments come available over the next few years, as tokenization will make the securities more efficient, liquid, and transparent.  Q: Are tokenized assets legal?  A: Most tokenized assets are simply regulated securities offerings, but the issuer is using the blockchain technology to make the tracking of ownership more efficient. Rather than using spreadsheets and proprietary databases to determine investment and ownership, they are using public, decentralized databases we call blockchains.  They are not volatile crypto assets like bitcoin and Ether, but are digital representations of real assets.  – Adam Blumberg CFP, co-founder of Interaxis  Keep Reading  Cloud giant Amazon delivers a security token platform for financial services companies to build on.  Securitize is able to issue and trade tokenized securities in Europe and US as part of new pilot program for digital assets.  Asia is embracing tokenization, are they leading the way?

42409942,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcQfXA,1692285645,"Coinbase, Tarred as an Illicit Exchange by the SEC, Quietly Got Regulated Elsewhere in the U.S.","Coinbase Inc. is the first crypto firm to get the gold-standard registration as a futures commission merchant, even as it remains in a legal battle for its life.  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission granted Coinbase the ability to handle bitcoin and ether futures, which is another argument that ether is a commodity.  As Coinbase Inc. (COIN) scraps with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on its right to exist as an exchange, the company has achieved an unprecedented milestone in U.S. oversight by winning approval to handle customers’ buying and selling of crypto futures.  In an industry desperate for U.S. regulation, Coinbase is now registered as a futures commission merchant, or FCM, with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), akin to an SEC-registered broker-dealer and a club that plays a key role at the core of U.S. derivatives trading. As the first crypto-native company to win that designation, it’s potentially blazing a path to U.S. oversight – at least in the world of commodities.  And because the U.S. regulator of commodities markets is effectively saying Coinbase can do business in bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) contracts, that permission could reinforce industry arguments that ether belongs in the commodities bucket – meaning it could face a less onerous U.S. regulatory regime. Ether fans are likely to welcome such news if it signals the SEC may not have a say in their asset.  “This is just one further nudge -- a little bit of extra confidence, a little bit of extra comfort that ether is – in fact – not a security,” said Dan Davis, a former general counsel at the CFTC.  Coinbase’s FCM registration may sound esoteric, but it’s a core part of the machinery in the financial sector, and there’s a high bar to winning that label.  “It's not an easy registration to get,” said Davis, who is now co-chair of the financial-markets practice at Katten Muchin Rosenman. “It's significant to get a registration like this,” he said, because a firm has to demonstrate strong systems for capital, disclosures, record keeping and segregating customer funds.  “It’s clear that in this instance, Coinbase was able to satisfy the regulatory requirements,"" he said.  While the approval for Coinbase Financial Markets technically came from the National Futures Association (NFA) – the industry-funded group that reviews registrations and enforces standards under CFTC authority – the derivatives agency has a direct hand in complex, novel or controversial applications. Coinbase checked all of those boxes with its 2021 application.  “You really see the branching paths that the CFTC has taken versus the SEC,” said Justin Slaughter, who has worked at both agencies and is now the policy director at Paradigm, which has an investment stake in Coinbase. The CFTC focused on getting a major crypto player registered, he said, while the SEC “is going to court to sue everybody.”  Black mark for SEC?  FCMs, which are held to exacting rules and pave the way for customers to trade on margin, represent an exclusive financial club populated by old-school firms such as Cboe Digital, the crypto unit of stock and options exchange operator Cboe Global Markets. And the CFTC’s welcome could represent a black mark for the SEC as it presses its legal clash with Coinbase.  “This is a setback to the SEC,” said Brent Xu, CEO and co-founder of Umee. “The CFTC has essentially said that Coinbase is a fully legitimate actor in the United States at a time when the SEC is saying that the exchange is not.”  In the same week in June, the regulator aimed massive enforcement actions at both Binance and Coinbase, declaring their fundamental business models violated U.S. securities law. Now, the SEC is fighting a multifront court battle with crypto firms about how to define unregistered crypto securities and illegal exchanges.  Coinbase denied the SEC’s allegations, arguing that they shouldn’t even apply. The new CFTC status doesn’t offer any new legal defense for the company in that dispute.  But the derivatives agency allowing a crypto-native company to join the ranks of traditional firms is a sign that the SEC is “out of step,” said Zachary Townsend, co-founder and CEO of Meanwhile, arguing that the CFTC is “moving in the exact opposite direction” as its sister regulator.  Still, crypto skeptics in Congress and consumer groups welcome SEC scrutiny on the industry. Todd Phillips, a former government lawyer and consumer advocate who teaches at Georgia State University, said the CFTC allowing major crypto exchange Coinbase to also be an FCM is illustrating a danger common across the industry.  “There are big concerns when firms control transactions from soup to nuts,” Phillips said. “That applies to Coinbase as well as traditional firms like NYSE. Owning brokers, exchanges and clearinghouses can raise costs for traders and makes market manipulation more possible.”  Whether welcome or not, this week’s development could be momentous.  Big deal  “It's a pretty darn big deal,” said Anthony Michael Sabino, a lawyer and professor at St. John's University. “It's like having a new Major League Baseball franchise.”  “It’s great for investors,” he said. “It’s good for market predictability and stability.”  “The ability to trade using margin gives customers leverage and access to the crypto market with less upfront investment than traditional spot trading,” Coinbase wrote in a blog entry on its announcement, which said the company will inform U.S. customers about how to access the service “in the coming months.”  The new status proves a crypto company can clear the regulatory hurdles and that the CFTC is willing to allow it to.  “The CFTC had the courage and Coinbase had the drive to answer those questions, and now the pathway is open,” Slaughter said.  While the SEC has so far approved one special-purpose broker-dealer for digital assets, Prometheum Inc., that obscure startup hasn’t yet tested its business model with trading. Coinbase, a publicly traded U.S. company that’s among the industry’s leading exchanges, has been doing it for years.  “The first is always the hardest,” Slaughter said. “You have to assume there'll be other applications coming.”  Read More: One-Two Punch Finally Registers SEC View on Binance, Coinbase, Rest of Crypto",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,"Jesse Hamilton, Helene Braun",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/08/17/coinbase-tarred-as-an-illicit-exchange-by-the-sec-quietly-got-regulated-elsewhere-in-the-us,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/23bc50e6bb556d87ac391ce6ae5e663ba489f4b4-4032x2268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409948,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcQfnh,1692284400,Ethereum 'Restaking' Takes Shape as Next Big Trend in Blockchain Security,"Why build your own security apparatus when you can rent?  That’s the premise behind “restaking,” a new concept taking hold in the crypto landscape – where the ether (ETH) tokens that are deposited or “staked” on Ethereum, the world’s second-largest blockchain – as a guarantee of security – can get reused and repurposed for smaller networks and applications.  The goal is to make it easier for blockchain developers to set up new projects without having to shoulder the high costs of rallying their own groups of operators or “validators” – and staked tokens – to assure that the new systems are secure.  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  For Ethereum stakers – those investors and users who deposit ETH tokens into the blockchain’s security mechanism to help guarantee the transactions – the ability to restake tokens to other projects outside of Ethereum could offer an additional source of income. Some 23.4 million ETH (worth $43 billion) have been staked on Ethereum, and there about 730,000 validators, according to the blockchain tracker beaconcha.in.  EigenLayer, founded in 2021 by the University of Washington’s Sreeram Kannan, is frequently credited as a pioneer of restaking. The protocol deployed its “Stage 1” launch on the main Ethereum network in June, after a two-month testing phase. A month prior, lead developer EigenLabs raised $50 million in a Series A fundraising, following an earlier $14.5 million seed round.  The EigenLayer protocol makes “it easier for anybody to be able to spin up and build their projects, where historically it was extremely difficult to bootstrap your own trust network,” said Brianna Montgomery, head of strategy at the company.  One risk is that restakers could be subject to “slashing” – penalties assessed against staked deposits – and the dynamic could eventually lead to conflicts of interest that might split the consensus on Ethereum. None other than Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, in a May 2023 blog post, flagged the potential for “high systemic risks to the ecosystem.”  Despite the natural urge to extend the blockchain’s core with more functionality, “we should instead preserve the chain’s minimalism, support uses of restaking that do not look like slippery slopes to extending the role of Ethereum consensus,” according to Buterin.  How does restaking work?  Through EigenLayer’s restaking techniques, the pooled security of ETH stakers extends Ethereum’s decentralized trust to other systems, according to the protocol’s documents. In the Stage 1 launch, EigenLayer supports liquid staking of Lido stETH, Rocket Pool ETH (rETH) and Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH (cbETH).  According to a whitepaper, “Stakers opt in by granting the EigenLayer smart contracts the ability to impose additional slashing conditions on their staked ETH, allowing an extension of cryptoeconomic security.”  The process is akin to the practice of “merged mining” on the Bitcoin blockchain, where hashpower – or computational power – is reapplied to another blockchain to provide security; Syscoin is one such project.  Bart Stephens, managing partner of lead investor Blockchain Capital, wrote in a blog post in March that “the types of cryptoeconomic protocols that are suitable to be built on EigenLayer are extremely broad and span everything from middleware to brand new blockchains.” Blockchain Capital was the lead investor in EigenLayer’s recent fundraising round.  Protocols made possible through restaking include “things like hyperscale data availability layers, off-chain ZKP verification protocols, protocols augmenting Ethereum’s censorship resistance, novel oracle mechanisms, cross-chain bridges/messaging protocols, decentralized sequencing protocols, as well as completely novel protocols we cannot even begin to imagine,” according to Stephens.  According to a June 5 Medium post on the topic by Ben Wee, EigenLayer “creates a marketplace for staking, where protocols can buy pooled security from validators, and validators can sell pooled security to protocols.”  EigenLabs developed its own protocol for “data availability” – a cost-saving measure that allows layer 2 networks and so-called “light clients” to confirm that transaction data is valid without having to actually download all data.  It’s called EigenDA, and according to Wee, “buyers of data availability on Ethereum (such as rollups) can purchase DA bandwidth at low fees.”  EigenLayer has announced plans to provider data availability services for layer 2 scaling solutions, Celo and Mantle, in addition to teaming up with other entities in the crypto ecosystem like Espresso Systems and Nethermind.  EigenLayer TVL  In a sign of demand for the protocol, the project has repeatedly raised its staking capacity, and the caps keep getting hit right away.  EigenLayer saw its total value locked – the value of tokens deposited on the protocol – quadruple to about $90 million in about two days after it announced on July 12 an increase in its restaking capacity for liquid staking tokens to 45,000, according to the tracking website DeFiLlama.  Within the first day, its limit for stETH and rETH – Lido and RocketPool’s liquid staking tokens – was reached, with cbETH, Coinbase’s staked ETH, hitting its capacity the next day, highlighting the enthusiasm of crypto users toward EigenLayer.  Last week, EigenLabs announced that the caps would be raised again on Aug. 22 – with additional deposits of the liquid staking tokens remaining open until any one of them hits 100,000 tokens restaked.  New applications leveraging the pooled security from staked ether through EigenLayer “impose additional slashing conditions on validators’ staked ETH, and in return, validators earn extra revenue for providing security and validation services,” said Nansen senior research analysts Osgur Murphy O Kane and Jake Kennis in a research report.  That’s what was apparently at the core of the essay that Buterin wrote in May pleading for Ethereum’s consensus or security mechanism to not be overloaded – specifically mentioning restaking and EigenLayer.  He said dual-use validator staked ETH is “fundamentally fine,” but the attempt to recruit “Ethereum social consensus for your application’s own purposes is not.”  Kannan, the EigenLayer founder, posted in response on X (formerly Twitter) on May 21 that he would “welcome this excellent analysis” and that the risk assessment “is consistent with what we have been advocating.”  After the Buterin salvo, “the conversation” about EigenLayer and restaking “became more thoughtful, with an emphasis on managing risk and aligning with the long-term interests of Ethereum,” Steven Quinn, head of research for the staking infrastructure firm P2P, told CoinDesk.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | RESEARCH | RPL,"Sage D.

This dormant wallet was one of the earliest Bitcoin wallets created, having received its first 1,000 BTC transaction in November 2010, just a little over a year after the Bitcoin mainnet launched. During this time of Bitcoin’s humble beginnings, its price never even broke above $0.20. However, the recent reactivation of this wallet has sparked speculation of whether a massive sell-off of the coins could be incoming. 💤 💤 💤 A dormant address containing 1,005 #BTC (29,750,772 USD) has just been activated after 12.8 years!https://t.co/rLkpUZUvfH — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) August 14, 2023 Cold Storage Just Turned Hot Reactivation of old and dormant wallets containing massive amounts like this often sparks speculation about who controls them, especially as dormant wallets get reactivated from time to time. 2023, in particular, has witnessed a high number of these Bitcoin wallets coming back to life. According to the Spent Output Age Bands (SOAB) indicator, the number of bitcoins that are between 7 and 10 years old has demonstrated an exceptionally significant increase in the most recent months. Using the SOAB indicator, investors are able to determine the age of Bitcoins currently available on the market as the lifespan of bitcoins is broken down into distinct ages. Kirill Kretov, a developer who specializes in the creation of automated trading programs, believes that the reactivation may have been carried out by the same entity. Considering its age, some Bitcoin investors also suggest this wallet might belong to Satoshi Nakamoto himself. However, this case would be very unlikely, as nobody knows who the Bitcoin creator actually is. BTC price falls to $28,500 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Bitcoin Selling Pressure Incoming? On-chain data shows that the last transaction on this wallet was in April 2011, where it received 5 BTC. Data from Coinmarketcap shows that the price of Bitcoin at this time was around $1.99. However, due to the consistent growth of Bitcoin over the last decade, the owner of this wallet now has over $29 million worth of Bitcoin at their disposal at the current BTC/USD exchange rates. This represents a gain of over 8.8 million percent from the wallet’s last transaction. This move could be bearish though if they decided to sell all of their holdings, it could introduce a fair amount of selling pressure on Bitcoin and cause the price to drop, at least temporarily. However, the owner has only moved the BTC to another wallet and not an exchange, suggesting they are more interested in HODLing – the option least likely to impact the market since the BTC would remain dormant. At the time of writing, bitcoin is trading at $28,501, down 2.24% in the last day.

42409952,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcQfuJ,1692282600,Sam Bankman-Fried Is Now in Jail,"It’s a bit of a truism in journalism that any headline that ends in a question that can be answered with “yes” or “no” will usually be answered with “no.” A few weeks ago, however, I asked “Is Sam Bankman-Fried Going to Jail?” and in a rejection of that truism, the answer was “yes.”  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Back behind bars  The narrative  Sam Bankman-Fried went to jail last week after a federal judge revoked his bond.  Why it matters  We now know the judge really is somewhat fed up with Bankman-Fried’s actions, reading out a 20-minute order walking through why he believed the FTX founder’s bond should be revoked before actually doing it. This sets the stage for the next phase of his pretrial work: preparing for trial from behind bars.  Breaking it down  Sam Bankman-Fried looked down for several long seconds last Friday in the moments after federal Judge Lewis Kaplan announced he was revoking the FTX founder’s bail. A few feet behind him, his mother Barbara Fried looked emotional while his father Joseph Bankman stared straight ahead.  Bankman-Fried has indeed gone to jail barely two months ahead of his trial on seven different charges, including securities fraud, wire fraud, commodities fraud and money laundering.  In revoking the bond, Judge Kaplan walked through a 20-minute summary of the facts as he saw them, including both Bankman-Fried’s reach-out to FTX.US general counsel Ryne Miller – who is expected to be a witness at trial – and the more recent diary episode.  “Defendant has proposed a benign reading of [the Signal message]. It’s one I didn’t share then and it’s one I don’t share now,” Kaplan said. Later, addressing the Times report, he said “it’s now undisputed the defendant spoke to a Times reporter and entertained the reporter on the virtual eve of the article’s publication.”  The virtual private network incident came up as well, with the judge saying that while alone it wasn’t necessarily a violation of his bond terms, it spoke to a dangerous mindset.  “[Bankman-Fried is willing] to risk crossing the line in an effort to get right up to [the line], wherever it is,” he said.  Bankman-Fried’s lawyers have appealed the decision, though the judge drew some audience laughs after remarking that appeals courts generally side with him. In the meantime, the attorneys asked that he approve Bankman-Fried to receive his prescription medication (the judge signed off on this) and both parties have started sorting out what pieces of discovery they do and don’t want to see at the trial.  The deadline for motions in limine – referring to pretrial motions seeking to limit evidence presented during the trial itself – was Monday, the same day the DOJ filed a superseding indictment providing further detail about the campaign finance allegations and defining the scope of what we may see during the trial itself.  Indictment first: All of the allegations themselves are familiar, and this is a modification of the first indictment, meaning the charges themselves aren’t new either.  The DOJ alleges that Bankman-Fried directed the use of customer funds to buy Bahamas real estate, make personal investments and donate to political campaigns.  “Bankman-Fried personally borrowed more than $1 billion from Alameda and oversaw similar borrowing by other FTX executives, which was then principally used to make investments in the name of Bankman-Fried and his associates, rather than in the name of Alameda. This conduct served to conceal the close connection to Alameda, as well as the criminal source of some of the funds,” the superseding indictment said.  But it’s the motions in limine that hold the really spicy stuff.  According to the DOJ, “three of the defendant’s co-conspirators, who have each pleaded guilty under cooperation agreements with the Government, will testify at trial” – referring to Gary Wang, the former FTX chief technology officer, Nishad Singh, the former FTX head of engineering and Caroline Ellison, the former Alameda Research CEO. We already knew this but I think this may be the first official confirmation.  While FTX President Ryan Salame, having pleaded the fifth, will not testify,, the DOJ does appear to have quite a few “private messages” from him quite literally spelling out how he was the person to route donations to Republican lawmakers and candidates while Bankman-Fried directed donations to Democrat lawmakers and candidates.  “In a private message to a trusted family member in November 2021, Salame explained that the defendant ‘want[ed] to donate to both democtratic [sic] and republican candidates in the US,’ but the defendant would not do so ‘cause the worlds frankly lost its mind if you dontate [sic] to a democrat no republicans will speak to you and if you donate to a republican then no democrats will speak to you,’” the filing said.  The DOJ also wants to play FTX ads and business records. While prosecutors hope Bankman-Fried will authenticate certain records, if he does not, they want to call these records’ custodians to the stand to speak to said records specifically.  The DOJ aims to block Bankman-Fried from arguing that FTX customers and investors didn’t conduct adequate due diligence on FTX and Alameda, as well as any evidence or claims that other crypto companies might be committing fraud and otherwise doing the same stuff FTX did, the filing said.  Prosecutors also want to block Bankman-Fried from arguing that he planned to make FTX customers whole.  In addition, the DOJ had a section saying the court shouldn’t allow Bankman-Fried to argue there was insufficient regulatory oversight.  “The defendant has made a number of public statements that suggest he may attempt to shift blame for the collapse of FTX onto regulatory agencies. While the defendant’s statements about his view of regulators have not always been consistent, he has stated that regulators ‘make everything worse’ and ‘don’t protect consumers at all,’” the filing said. “Arguments attempting to shift the blame for FTX’s collapse onto regulators are improper and should be excluded because a supposed absence of sufficient regulatory protections would not excuse the defendant’s fraud.”  According to the filing, the DOJ is also concerned that Bankman-Fried might try and claim that he committed “good acts” in his defense, and argues that he shouldn’t be allowed to try that.  There's also a section saying the defense team shouldn’t be allowed to question any of the witnesses about their recreational drug use.  For its part, the defense team filed a much shorter set of motions in limine, starting with an argument that the DOJ shouldn’t be allowed to introduce any evidence that was produced for the defense team as discovery after July 1, 2023.  “As the defense has raised with the Court on numerous occasions, the Government has repeatedly failed to meet the discovery deadlines it represented to the Court and to this day continues to produce voluminous documents to the defense,” the filing said. “ This includes a production just three days ago of nearly three-quarters of a million pages of Slack messages from Gary Wang’s laptop that the Government originally promised to produce by the end of March.”  The defense team did agree with the DOJ in its second motion, in which both parties say bankruptcy issues are out of the scope of this particular trial.  Moreover, the defense wants to block the DOJ from referencing any of Bankman-Fried’s public statements about FTX.US, rather than FTX.com.  The ball is now in the judge’s court, both for scheduling another arraignment on the latest superseding indictment and in responding to the motions.

The SEI token tumbled 24% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko, pushing the market capitalization to $314.8 million.  That's a disappointment relative to some traders who had bet that the SEI value might approach $500 million.  The Sei Foundation, which coordinated the airdrop, posted on X early Thursday that it had tripled the number of eligible wallets for the cross-bridge airdrop to 1.5 million from 500,000, on blockchains including Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum and Solana. The expansion was ""due to fervent demand,"" according to the post.  One user quickly retorted on X that ""U should focus on increasing the allocation to your own users,"" including those ""who helped u test for months on Testnet,"" and that the project should ""later think of other chains.""

In conjunction with the established entities such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, the cryptocurrency market has experienced significant growth with a diverse range of alternative coins, each presenting unique attributes and prospective prospects. Related Reading: Cardano Holder Resilience Tested As ADA Fends Off Bearish Onslaught Altcoins, which comprise a diverse array of technological advancements, application cases, and governance frameworks, provide investors a wide range of options to consider. THORChain Emits Force In The Weekly Chart THORChain (RUNE), renowned for its cross-chain liquidity mechanism, has garnered significant attention this week due to a different factor. RUNE price action today. Source: Coingecko According to statistics from Coingecko, THORChain is currently priced at $1.54, reflecting an increase of 50% over the past seven days. However, it has had a decline of 3.7% within the last 24 hours. The boost in price can be attributed to a concurrent rise in the social volume of the THORChain cryptocurrency. According to data from Coincodex, there was a significant increase in social volume, exceeding 4,300%, during the period from August 7 to 13. The price of RUNE has exhibited a bullish trend since the middle of June. However, this upward movement was interrupted when the price above the $1 threshold and subsequently began to undergo a retracement. The price of the cryptocurrency established a support level at $0.92 following a significant decline, then initiating a bullish recovery to surpass the prominent psychological threshold of $1. RUNE reaches $527 million in market cap today. Chart: TradingView.com In the preceding month, the cryptocurrency had a notable increase of 30%, while also exhibiting a 5% rise since the commencement of the year 2023. Nevertheless, the performance of the subject over an extended period of time presents a more pessimistic portrayal. Over the course of the previous four quarters, there was a significant decline of around 50% in the value of the coin, suggesting the presence of inherent instability. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has experienced a significant decline of 94% from its peak value of $20.87 in May 2021, highlighting the fundamental instability of the cryptocurrency market. RUNE Faces Resistance At $1.55 Although there have been recent positive developments that may be encouraging for investors with short-term goals, the overall trend indicates that there have been challenges over longer time periods. The significant declines observed in the past year, as well as from the highest point, underscore the precarious nature of cryptocurrency investments. This necessitates a careful evaluation of their long-term viability within a dynamic market environment. RUNE price action in the last seven days. Source: Coingecko Related Reading: Dogecoin Looming Plunge: Factors Point Toward An Imminent Significant Decline At present, the RUNE token is undergoing a phase of surpassing the significant resistance level of $1.55, which has persisted for an extended period of time. This particular domain holds significant importance as it has alternately functioned as both a point of opposition and reinforcement from the onset of the year 2021. Hence, the act of closing above it will serve as a significant indication of a positive trend, thereby reinforcing the bullish readings observed on the daily timescale. As the liquidity mechanism for THORChain may develop over the next few months, cryptocurrency experts anticipate even further price hikes for the platform. Additionally, 14 new nodes are prepared to join the THORChain network, according to CoinCodex. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice. Investing involves risk.

Controversial new measures known as the travel rule, requiring crypto operators to identify the sender and recipient of funds transfers, are already legislated to take effect in the U.K. as of Sept. 1. While the money-laundering norms haven’t yet been fully implemented across the world, the U.K.'s upcoming stricter rules, including for advertising, have already put a halt to the crypto business of companies such as PayPal.  When receiving funds from countries that don’t yet comply with the travel rule and with incomplete data, crypto firms should be “making a risk-based assessment of whether to make the cryptoassets available to the beneficiary,” said the FCA’s guidance.  Firms should still collect customer data even if the transfer destination can’t receive it, and should fully comply with the new legislation when making transfers within the U.K. or other compliant jurisdictions, the FCA added.  Though the government has previously said it wants to make the U.K. a crypto hub, many in the industry fear that goal is getting harder thanks to tighter regulations in areas such as crypto ads, and regulatory hurdles that as many as 86% of firms can’t surmount.

The number one cryptocurrency by market cap stands at support with the potential for another re-test of the lows if bulls cannot push it higher. Related Reading: Polygon: New Partnership With Korean Telecom Giant Fails To Halt MATIC Slide As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $28,500 with a 2% loss in the past 24 hours. Over the previous week, the cryptocurrency recorded a 3% loss, while other assets in the top 10 underperformed and trended lower. The nascent industry could be a short-term crossroads. Bitcoin Price Loses $29,000 Level, But A Recovery Is Likely? As NewsBTC has been reporting, Bitcoin’s volatility reached a multi-year low after all major narratives previously influencing it diminished its strength. Now, the spike in volatility favored the downside, but how much pressure can the bears exercise? According to a CryptoQuant analyst, the recent price action marks one of the highest in recent months. As seen in the chart below, the last time that Bitcoin saw similar selling pressure was in late July. The analyst stated: This marks the strongest surge in selling since July 15th. It wouldn’t be surprising to witness the pinnacle of selling pressure at this very moment. As seen in the chart above, the price of Bitcoin bounced back from support each time that sellers pushed into the current levels, as measured by the Net Taker Volume. However, sellers could still push the metric into the July 15th levels and induce a capitulation event. There is some evidence to support the above. The chart below shows that BTC’s long positions have fueled the downside price action by providing liquidity and accelerating the fall. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Takes a Bit Hit: Main Reasons $1,720 or $1,650 Are Likely Targets If this continues, Bitcoin could continue trending downwards into the liquidity pool created by long positions at $27,000 and $24,700 if bulls give it. On the latter, crypto analytics firm Material Indicators noted: Bitcoin price and liquidity continuing to erode and a critical test of support is eminent.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin (BTC) has broken out from its very tight trading range, but not in ways the bulls would have liked to see. The leading cryptocurrency slipped to as low as $28,346 early Thursday, its weakest level since June 21. The decline extended a slide that began earlier this week and mirrored risk aversion on Wall Street. The formerly red-hot stock market averages have been slumping in August, with interest rate fears, banking sector concerns and worry heading the reasons to sell. The downside volatility in BTC comes days after the U.S. Commodity and Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC) Commitment of Traders (COT) report showed leveraged funds – hedge funds and commodity trading advisors – ramped up bearish bets in the CME-listed cash-settled bitcoin futures in the week ended Aug. 8.  Payments giant PayPal will temporarily pause crypto purchases in the United Kingdom until early 2024, the company said Wednesday, citing stricter rules by the country’s financial regulator. Customers who have previously purchased crypto assets through their PayPal account can keep them on the platform or sell them at any time, said the company. Starting October 1, however, the ability to make new purchases will be disabled. “We're taking this measure in response to new rules enacted by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) that require crypto firms to implement additional steps before customers can purchase crypto,” PayPal said in a statement. This comes as the company has accelerated its footprint in crypto in recent weeks, specifically in the United States with the launch of a stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD), which the payments giant announced earlier this month.  Jada AI, an artificial intelligence project that harnesses blockchain technology, has raised $25 million from alternative investment group LDA Capital. The project aims to offer AI services that aid decision-making for organizations and scale up their operations, according to an emailed announcement shared with CoinDesk. The capital will be used to grow the project’s team of developers and add new organizations. Jada operates in a blockchain-based environment where AI computations are executed among the nodes participating in the network. “This allows for the AI’s processing to be untampered, cross-verified and equally distributed to enable an efficient allocation of compute resources,” Jada AI founder Diego Torres told CoinDesk in an email.  Chart of the day  The chart shows the share of U.S.-based crypto exchanges and their global counterparts in the 2% market depth or global liquidity in bitcoin and ether trading pairs.  The U.S. exchanges are losing liquidity, meaning traders can now execute large orders at stable prices on offshore exchanges.  Liquidity is commonly tracked with the help of an indicator called the 2% market depth. Its a collection of buy and sell orders within 2% of the mid-price or the average of the bid and the ask/offer prices.

16327873,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/5-ways-to-earn-passive-income-with-idle-computer-storage,1692275400,5 Ways to Earn Passive Income With Idle Computer Storage,"The University of California Berkeley’s SETI@Home project is no longer allowing new users to participate in its ongoing search for extraterrestrial life, meaning it’s no longer able to provide a passive income stream for those who’re willing to leave their computer on 24/7. The SETI@Home project launched way back in 1999, inviting users to download a special software program that enabled them to donate their excess computing power to the initiative, which is looking for signs of alien life elsewhere in the cosmic void. But much to people’s disappointment, scientists announced in 2021 that they’re winding down the project and no longer require contributions from the general public. While the announcement was a major disappointment for participants, the good news is that there are still many other distributed computing projects that allow users to make money by renting out their idle storage space or processing power. What is Distributed Computing? It might sound incredibly technical, but the concept of distributed computing is actually a very simple one. It refers to a process where the combined resources of multiple, distributed computers are aggregated together, providing powerful compute or storage resources for heavy-duty projects. In some ways it can be likened to Airbnb, but instead of renting out your spare room or vacation home, you simply rent out your unused computing resources. To participate, you’ll need to download and install the required application or plugin for whatever project it is you want to contribute to. Then it’ll run in the background, allowing your computer’s excess resources to be used by the organization concerned. Where Can I Participate? There are dozens of interesting projects looking to borrow people’s excess computing capacity in support of various use cases: Spacemesh Mining cryptocurrency is one of the most obvious ideas for utilizing your spare capacity that comes to mind, but it’s important to choose a suitable network. While it was possible to mine Bitcoin from a PC back in the early days, its cryptographic algorithms have become so complex and its mining ecosystem so competitive that such limited hardware simply won’t do any more. Enter Spacemesh, an alternative cryptocurrency network that’s designed to serve the average joe who wants to mine a little crypto on his or her computer at home. Unlike Bitcoin’s proof-of-work consensus algorithm, Spacemesh uses a novel proof-of-space time consensus mechanism that is much less energy-intensive. It also employs a unique “race-free approach” that disincentivizes the use of massive amounts of hardware, ensuring everyone can participate and earn a passive income on their personal Mac or PC. All that’s required to start mining with Spacemesh is an Intel or AMD CPU with at least 1GB of RAM, and an always-on, unmetered internet connection with a minimum of 5 Mbps download and 1 Mbps upload. Unlike Bitcoin, where the CPU is the main factor for miners, Spacemesh relies on disk storage resources, which do not use energy when they’re idle, resulting in much lower costs. The protocol is centered on fairness, and ensures all miners are rewarded for their contributions at every EPOCH, which currently concludes every two weeks, with their exact reward based on how much storage space they commit in proportion to the network size. In addition, the protocol prevents whales from joining the system with massive storage resources – in such a case, they would face much higher overhead costs, eliminating any profit gains. In this way, Spacemesh ensures its network remains highly decentralized. HyperCycle As an alternative, PC and laptop owners can opt to join the HyperCycle network, which is a Layer-0 blockchain that’s building an artificial general intelligence network. The idea with this is to promote cooperation between AI agents by establishing a network of nodes that collaborate with one another to solve complex problems. This cooperative AI sees distributed computers aggregate their compute resources to create a “global brain”, kind of like a distributed supercomputer. AI systems can tap into this network and use its combined power to perform computing tasks that would normally be performed by sophisticated server networks. Users are required to purchase an individual software node license to participate in HyperCycle’s network and deposit a minimum of 1,024 HYPC tokens. That might sound expensive, but HyperCycle insists it’s a small price to pay to democratize access to advanced AI computation and pave the way for a future “Internet of AIs”. Fleek Network A great option for Web3 enthusiasts, Fleek Network is calling on users to participate in the industry’s first decentralized edge network. Edge networks are made up of nodes, or subnetworks, positioned closer to end users and directly connected to the network core. They enable content to be delivered to end users with lower latency, no matter where they are located, while providing services such as serverless functions, SSR (server-side rendering), container orchestration and various database functions. Examples of edge network devices include WiFi access points, sensors, branch offices and individual computers. Fleek Network is building the first decentralized edge network, as an alternative to centralized networks that go against the ethos of Web3. It’s not feasible to build out a global network of edge devices from scratch, so instead it relies on individuals who are willing to provide computing resources in exchange for rewards. With Fleek, anyone can contribute edge resources by running a cache node. As a node operator, users can contribute resources including bandwidth, CPUs and GPUs to enable Fleek’s edge services. The goal is to provide a shared performance layer that every Web3 protocol can leverage. With its protocol-agnostic and modular architecture, Fleek’s edge network can add value to virtually any decentralized application or service. Storj If you have plenty of hard drive space and you’re willing to put it to work, Storj offers a viable opportunity with its decentralized cloud storage network, which it presents as an alternative to services like Dropbox, Box and Amazon Web Services. It claims to have some big advantages, including greater privacy with guarantees that content stored within the Storj network will never be monitored or censored. All content stored on people’s hard drives is fully encrypted, and only the owner has the keys required to access it. The other key selling point is that content is automatically distributed across multiple devices, eliminating the risk of downtime that would prevent users from accessing their files. To rent out your extra disk drive space to Storj, all that’s required is to download its application, install it, and then select how much storage capacity you want to contribute. Once activated, that portion of your hard drive becomes a part of the Storj network so you can no longer use it yourself. Instead, you’ll be compensated for renting it out. One of the requirements, obviously, is that you must be willing to leave your computer up and running and ensure it’s always online, in return for payments made to your bank account each month. Hyperlink Hyperlink refers to itself as the “World Supercomputer”, but is really a global network of computers that anyone can join to earn passive income. Users donate their computer’s resources to host third-party websites, mobile applications and content. Its services are offered as a low-cost alternative to businesses that don’t want to invest in their own infrastructure or traditional cloud computing services. One of the advantages of Hyperlink is that it claims to offer significant earnings potential for users, saying it’s possible to earn up to $8,600 per year by connecting a desktop or laptop to its network and leaving it running 24/7. Users can even contribute an entire server if they happen to have one lying around. Another bonus is that Hyperlink offers flexible payment options, allowing users to receive their earnings through PayPal, bank transfers, credit card payment and more. In future, Hyperlink will expand its network to include tablets and smartphones too. What Are The Downsides? There actually does not seem to be a lot of downsides to earning a passive income, but those considering it should be aware that by running these programs and keeping their computer switched on 24/7, it may degrade its performance and lifetime. However, the reality is that most people don’t normally use the full capacity of their machine, so they can afford to contribute without really noticing any performance impact. And of course, it’s always possible to use an external storage device if you do need more disk space. Then again, if you do need to perform intensive computing tasks yourself, it might be worth investing in a more powerful machine, or even a second computer that you can leave running and forget about.

16147227,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=547675,1692275106,Crypto Payments Gain Ground In Canada As Confidence Grows,"A recent study by the Bank of Canada (BoC) revealed that crypto ownership in the country had slowed over the past two years. However, recent sentiment from Coinbase’s Country Director for Canada, Lucas Matheson, suggests Canadians are slowly warming up to crypto again. Canadians Adopting Crypto Payments In a conversation with Cointelegraph, Matheson mentioned that Canadians’ outlook towards digital assets is changing as they adopt it to make daily transactions. This means that crypto in the country is garnering mass adoption as service providers and consumers are using it to facilitate payment of goods and services. Related Reading: Shiba Inu DAO Gets Serious With New Advisory And Investment Firm Furthermore, Matheson believes that more daily use cases will arise that will be “digital asset-backed.” This belief could stem from the fact that the tokenized industry is rapidly growing with many real-world assets (RWA) being brought on-chain. Many industries are expected to be disrupted with the help of blockchain technology and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The E-commerce industry is one that Matheson has singled out to be significantly impacted by NFTs. He said the major use case would be “phygital” items, where fashion brands create the tokenized version of their physical products. Popular brands like Nike and Lacoste are known to have ventured into the metaverse with the introduction of their tokenized wear. Coinbase And Key Regulations Integral Matheson emphasized the importance of regulatory certainty and how Coinbase is contributing to the crypto industry’s growth in Canada. According to him, the crypto exchange was working closely with the Canadian authorities to build trust and help them understand the role of digital assets in building a sustainable economy. Coinbase officially launched in the Canadian market on August 14. The company announced that it had partnered with local banks and payment platforms to ensure easy fiat on-ramp and make crypto more accessible to Canadians. Furthermore, Coinbase rolled out its Interac payment rails to enable local users “seamlessly deposit and withdraw funds (CAD) to and from their Coinbase wallets…” Meanwhile, Canada’s lawmakers have shown commitment to backing the crypto industry in the country by providing regulatory certainty to stakeholders in the industry. In June, the Canadian House of Commons Parliamentary Standing Committee on Industry and Technology published a report highlighting the positive impacts blockchain technology could have on the economy and the need to provide regulatory clarity and protect the interests of consumers. Related Reading: Executives Of Crypto-Friendly Bank Silvergate Step Down As Lawsuits, Liquidation Rages On The report also proposed an innovative regulatory approach for cryptocurrencies, emphasizing how Canada could become a leader in the crypto economy. With such efforts from Coinbase accompanied by regulatory certainty, Crypto adoption is bound to grow. Interestingly, the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) claims that over 30% of Canadians plan to buy crypto by 2024.

Institutional liquidity provider OrBit Markets is tasked with creating order book liquidity.  The new product expands BIT's existing suite of options on bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), Cardano's ADA, Toncoin (TON), and Milady Coin (LADYS).  Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy, and a put option gives the right to sell.  Traders typically use options as hedging tools to mitigate bearish/bullish risks or generate additional income by ""writing"" options on top of their spot market holdings.  ""We are proud to become one of the first exchanges making XRP options trading accessible to both institutional and retail traders, enabling long and short for options traders at the same time. We look forward to bringing this product to more traders and investors alike across the globe,"" Justin Buitendam, global head of institutional sales at BIT, said in the press release.  XRP is the world's fifth largest cryptocurrency, boasting a market capitalization of $30.88 billion at press time. The cryptocurrency, just like other alternative coins, tends to be more volatile than bitcoin and ether.  BIT's decision to list XRP options comes weeks after a U.S. District Court, in a highly anticipated hearing in the U.S. SEC's case against Ripple Labs for violating securities law through XRP sales, said that XRP is not a security when offered over centralized exchanges, but is one when sold directly to institutions. The distinction threw a spanner in the SEC's attempts to paint all alternative cryptocurrencies with the same brush.  Since then, several exchanges have re-listed the XRP spot market. More recently, the SEC has asked to appeal the court ruling, injecting renewed uncertainty in the market.  XRP surged over 70% to nearly 95 cents following the July 13 court ruling. Since then, it has retreated to trade at 65 cents at press time, CoinDesk data show.",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SPONSORED | XRP,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/17/crypto-investors-can-now-trade-xrp-options-on-bit-exchange,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b191b8e24e8b656d4dea92d65a43a55f86fb6151-1704x1075.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The deal, which also waives Genesis' parallel claims against FTX, represents a significant reduction from the nearly $4 billion FTX originally sought.  Lawyers hope it will help the companies wind up affairs and return funds to customers, after lender Genesis Global Capital filed for bankruptcy in January. Genesis and CoinDesk both belong to the Digital Currency Group.  “The settlement will, among other things, significantly smooth the path to confirmation of the Genesis Debtors’ chapter 11 plan of reorganization” without the cost of extended litigation, a court filing made by Genesis’ lawyers said.  In a parallel court filing, FTX’s Chief Executive Officer John J. Ray III agreed the deal was fair, saying it represented FTX’s best interests given legal uncertainties about the claims.  The crypto winter has seen the collapse of multiple crypto companies which often had complex financial interrelationships, which lawyers are now attempting to unpick in parallel bankruptcy proceedings.  FTX’s original claims against Genesis amounted to $3.88 billion, including loan repayments made by hedge fund arm Alameda Research and assets withdrawn by Genesis from the FTX exchange in the run up to its November bankruptcy.  In the other direction, Genesis Global Capital is FTX’s largest unsecured creditor, with court filings citing $226 million owed.  In July, lawyers announced they’d reached an agreement in principle but did not release full details.

16145396,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=547652,1692270959,Polygon: New Partnership With Korean Telecom Giant Fails To Halt MATIC Slide,"The Polygon (MATIC) price continues to fall. Even the recent positive news from Korea and the strong data from the NFT market cannot change this. Since the yearly high on February 13 at $1.56, the MATIC price has currently fallen 60% and is trading at just $0.6169. Since the high, MATIC has been in a clear downtrend, which was last tested in mid-July. However, a breakout was not successful, both the trendline and the coinciding 200-day EMA have proven to be too strong a resistance. Now MATIC has also fallen below the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.75. If the support at $0.60 (in shorter time frames) now also falls, a plunge towards the yearly low at $0.50 could be imminent. However, if the level establishes itself as support in the next few days, a new attempt to break out of the downtrend could start. Related Reading: When Will Polygon (MATIC) Rebound? Analyzing This Month’s Recovery Potential For this, MATIC would currently have to rise above $0.71. However, validation of the breakout from the downtrend would have to come from the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level. Only if MATIC rises above $0.75 the bulls might regain the upper hand. Then, the 200-day EMA at $0.84 would be the next major task that MATIC bulls have to master. Until then, MATIC seems poised for further downside. Even Positive News Can’t Move Polygon Price It is a bad omen for the MATIC bulls that even positive news cannot move the price. In the last two days Polygon has been able to report no less than two positive news. Today, Polygon Labs has inked a strategic alliance with SK Telecom (NYSE:SKM), South Korea’s foremost mobile telecom operator. This collaboration is geared towards the expansion of SKT’s Web3 ecosystem, positioning the telecom behemoth at the forefront of the burgeoning decentralized tech sector. Polygon’s CEO, Marc Boiron, elucidated the intent behind the partnership, stating, “Polygon Labs has been developing optimal blockchain technology for Web3 popularization, and we see this collaboration with SKT as an important step in providing Web3 experiences to more consumers.” Central to this synergy is the integration of the Polygon blockchain within SKT’s NFT marketplace, TopPort, as well as its forthcoming Web3 wallet, set for launch in 2023. The wallet promises to offer users high-speed, cost-effective transactions, augmented by Ethereum’s intrinsic security and decentralization features. Given the widespread utilization of Polygon-based solutions by global brands, this integration is likely to enhance SKT’s Web3 offerings considerably. Related Reading: Polygon Warning Signs Point To Slide In MATIC Price On Support Breakdown Both entities will be actively scouring for promising Web3 startups to nurture and support. “By combining our experience in blockchain services and Polygon Lab’s blockchain infrastructure and ecosystem, we will be able to create valuable business opportunities and boost the Web3 ecosystem,” voiced Oh Se-hyun, Vice President and Head of Web3 CO at SKT. Moreover, Polygon’s NFT ecosystem clinched the second spot in traded volume over a month-long period, as highlighted by Polygon Labs founder Sandeep Nailwal. Interestingly, this surge can be attributed not just to high-value transactions but a flurry of micro-transactions, indicating Polygon’s accessibility and widespread use. By number of transactions, Polygon is 3x of Ethereum mainchain, that means there is a lot of micro transactions happening. The amount of “buyers” on Polygon also is 30% higher than the mainchain. This trend clearly solidifies Polygon’s burgeoning position in the decentralized tech sector.

16142106,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=547632,1692263429,Fantom DEX SpiritSwap On The Verge Of Shutdown? Here’s What Has Changed,"SpiritSwap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) on Fantom, will no longer be shutting down its operations in September after it received a takeover offer from Power, another Fantom-based DeFi protocol. The proposed shutdown was a result of cross-chain protocol Multichain’s collapse, which had a significant impact on the Fantom ecosystem. On August 9, SpiritSwap announced on Discord that it is “winding down” operations and is looking for a team to take over the project after its treasury was drained in the Multichain exploit. The protocol initially planned to shut down by September 1, 2023, but it appears that won’t be happening anymore after Power’s intervention. This would come as a relief to several SpiritSwap community members, especially those who have the native token SPIRIT locked on the protocol. According to the protocol’s website, there are currently over 410 million SPIRIT tokens locked. Power To Deposit 200,000 USDC Into The SpiritiSwap Treasury On August 16, the SpiritSwap community approved the proposal to hand the keys of the protocol to Power, a non-fungible token platform on Fantom. Power has now proposed to deposit 200,000 USDC into the SpiritSwap treasury. Related Reading: Stellar Breaks Free: Unleashes New Open-Source Disbursement Platform The team behind the NFT platform stated in the proposal that the deployment of these funds into the treasury is the first phase of ensuring that SpiritSwap survives. Meanwhile, Power claims to hold more than $1 million in liquid assets across multiple chains “ready to mobilize for use”. In the proposal, the Power team clarified that it has also been developing its own decentralized exchange, PowerSwap. Then, it laid out plans to integrate some designs of the new DEX into SpiritSwap. It is worth mentioning that Power was also impacted by the Multichain exploit. Fortunately, the protocol’s treasury assets were not bridged to Multichain, leading to relatively small losses. Multichain Exploit – The Impact On Fantom The Fantom ecosystem was the biggest victim in the Multichain exploit in July, which resulted in a total loss of over $126 million. The attack seemed to have specifically targeted the protocol’s Fantom bridge, causing a drain of more than $120 million worth of assets. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Takes a Bit Hit: Main Reasons $1,720 or $1,650 Are Likely Targets As inferred earlier, the ripple effect of the Multichain hack spread across various projects on the Fantom blockchain. As a result, the total value locked (TVL) on the network has been on a steady decline. Fantom has seen its TVL drop by more than 61% since July 6 – the day of the Multichain exploit. As of this writing, the total value locked on the network stands at about $86.2 million, according to data from DefiLlama.

The leading cryptocurrency has rallied over 70% this year in a textbook bullish price action, comprising higher swing lows and higher swing highs.  The bullish trendline in consideration connects the early January low and the swing lows registered in March and June. As of writing, the trendline was located below $28,000, with bitcoin changing hands near $28,600.  The trendline violation would invalidate the bullish bias, according to Peter Brandt, CEO of Factor LLC.  ""As a swing trader, I would respect the violation of the trendline. So, my positions would be either short or flat,"" Brandt, who has been trading foreign exchange and commodity markets for over thirty years, tweeted Wednesday.  ""Only if a bear trap is actually 'sprung' would I consider it a bullish development. I strongly prefer horizontal chart construction,"" Brandt added.  A bear trap will be confirmed if prices quickly reverse a potential trendline breakdown, leaving sellers on the wrong side of the market. Failed breakdowns of key support levels are widely considered strong bullish signals.  Per Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto services provider Matrixport, potential invalidation of the trendline could yield deeper losses.

16139943,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=547608,1692258233,Shiba Inu (SHIB) Dips By 7% Following Shibarium Launch,"Shibarium, an Ethereum layer 2 solution, can be termed one of the most-hyped crypto projects of 2023, expected to introduce a higher network speed and lower transaction costs to the Shiba Inu ecosystem. After months of beta testing, Shiba Inu developers finally announced on August 16 that the Shibariun mainnet is now live. However, contrary to popular predictions, SHIB, Shiba Inu’s most prominent token, appears to have taken a nosedive upon this development. SHIB Maintains Bearish Form As Shibarium’s Ethereum Bridge Develops Fault So far, Shibarium’s launch has yielded a negative effect on SHIB, with the token losing 6.86% of its value in the last 24 hours based on data from CoinMarketCap. Prior to SHIB’s dip today, the token had shown an overall negative performance this week, falling from $0.00001059 on Monday to $0.000009527 on Wednesday. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Keeps Energy Alive, Snags 26% Gain – Here’s The Inside Scoop For now, SHIB’s loss post-Shibarium launch can be attributed to a technical issue with the much-anticipated project. According to a post by Whalechart on X, more than $1.7 million worth of ETH is presently stuck in the Shibarium bridge. This development has caused much panic among investors. In addition, it seems these assets may be unretrievable following a message being circulated on social media that appears to be from Shiba Inu developer Shytoshi Kusama. Meanwhile, it is worth stating SHIB is not the only Shiba Inu token under significant selling pressure, with the BONE and LEASH also declining by 15.48% and 22.59%, respectively, over the last day. Could Shibarium Be A Set Back To The Shiba Inu Ecosystem? Shibarium was designed to enable the various projects of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, such as the Shib Metaverse, Shibaswap DEX, and the Shiboshi NFT Project, to operate at an increased speed while offering users lesser transaction costs. Furthermore, all Shibarium transactions are to lead to SHIB burn, thus serving as a deflationary mechanism of the token. Due to these proposed features of the Shibarium project, it was widely expected that the layer 2 solution could bring about a higher adoption of SHIB and other Shiba Inu native tokens which in turn could boost market prices. There were many positive signs backing this prediction, with the SHIB token notching significant gains upon any news on the progress of Shibarium in the last few months. Related Reading: More Selling? Bankrupt Voyager Sends Millions In SHIB And ETH To Coinbase In fact, Shibarium launched on Wednesday with 21 million wallets created, demonstrating a high level of user interest. However, the recent issue with the Ethereum bridge provides much concern for Shiba Inu investors on if the Shibarium project can live up to its potential. Nevertheless, it may still be considered too early to call the project a failure, especially as there is no official statement from the Shiba Inu team addressing this challenge. At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.000009295, with a 0.37% gain in the last hour. Meanwhile, the token’s daily trading volume is down by 0.42%, sitting at $431.32 million.

Bitcoin slumped to just under $28,500 late on Wednesday, marking one of the largest two-day price drops since mid-June. Bitcoin weakness caused majors, such as ether, XRP and solana (SOL) to follow suit, falling as much as 5%.  Liquidations on futures tracking major tokens crossed the $160 million mark in the past 24 hours, pushing to over $320 million in losses since the start of this week. Such losses come amid one of the lowest volatility periods for bitcoin.  Bitcoin futures racked up nearly $50 million in losses, followed by ether at $22 million and litecoin (LTC) at $5 million. Traders of bitcoin cash (BCH), solana, and XRP took on nearly $4.5 million in losses apiece.  Long trades, or bets on higher prices, accounted for 90% of the total liquidations, Coinglass data shows.  Liquidation occurs when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. This happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position or fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open.  Large liquidations can signal the local top or bottom of a price move, which may allow traders to position themselves accordingly.  Open interest, or the number of unsettled contracts, rose 1.16%, meaning traded opened more positions but ultimately used significantly lesser leverage – suggesting lesser risk-on sentiment.  Meanwhile, trading firm QCP Capital said in a Telegram broadcast earlier this week that it expected prices to gradually fall lower in the immediate absence of market catalysts. It added that price levels of between $24,000 to $26,000 for bitcoin could be expected in the coming months.”",NEGATIVE,BCH | LTC | SOL,BCH | LTC | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/17/crypto-long-trades-account-for-90-of-total-liquidations-as-bitcoin-ether-slump,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/90a52243af644b90d6fcfb7bb2ddf4d8b05abb0f-7757x3660.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419754,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFi9N,1692251157,"Bitcoin Plunges 9%, Sank Below $25K on Binance as August Turns Very Ugly","Bitcoin runs into selling pressure as rates go higher and Wall Street turns risk-averse.  Leveraged funds are the most bearish in bitcoin futures since April 2022.  Bitcoin (BTC) tumbled about 9% Thursday and briefly sank below $25,000 on Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, as what had been a relatively boring August turned into a bloodbath as Wall Street turns more risk-averse.  The CoinDesk Bitcoin Index slumped to the lowest level in two months. Ether (ETH) fared no better, plunging 11% to about $1,600.  Binance Coin (BNB), a token associated with the exchange where selling pressure was especially intense, dropped almost 7%  The broad CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) was lower by 8.9%.  U.S. interest rates hit multi-year highs  Among the factors behind the selling is a continued surge in global interest rates, particularly in the U.S., where the 30-year Treasury bond rose to 4.42%, its highest level since 2011, according to Bloomberg. The 10-year yield at 4.32 has risen to just a basis point shy of about a 15-year high.  That's helped put a damper on not just crypto prices, but risk assets in general. Though holding the flatline today, the Nasdaq is lower by about 6% for the month of August.  ""Higher bond yields signal a weaker investment case for equities,"" macro analyst Noelle Acheson wrote in a market report Thursday morning. ""Tighter credit leads to lower growth, higher discount rates bring down cash flow valuations, and the equity risk premium has plummeted to 2007 levels.""  ""Higher bond yields also suggest a weaker investment case for non-yielding assets such as BTC and gold,"" she added. ""However strong the hard asset case may be, yield is yield, and BTC and gold don’t have any.""  Spot bitcoin ETF hopes  While bitcoin bulls have pointed to what they hope will be the SEC's imminent approval of a spot bitcoin ETF, there's no guarantee the SEC even makes a decision in 2023 on any of the numerous applications in front of the agency, let alone give its approval.  Another positive catalyst might be a favorable court decision for Grayscale – owner of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) – in its lawsuit against the SEC to force approval of its attempt to convert that trust into an ETF. There had been some hope a ruling could come on Tuesday, but that day has passed and now watchers are eyeing Friday as a possibility.  Bearish bets on BTC  The downside volatility in BTC also comes days after the U.S. Commodity and Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC) report on commitment of traders (COT) showed leveraged funds – hedge funds and commodity trading advisors – ramped up bearish bets in the CME-listed cash-settled bitcoin futures in the week ended Aug. 8.  ""Two-thirds of their positions are short (shown in red) versus one-third long (shown in blue). That's the widest it's been in since April 2022,"" Lawrence Lewitinn, director of content at crypto analytics firm The Tie's, said in a weekly newsletter.  Perhaps sophisticated traders are worried about potential spillovers from murky macro outlook and rising nominal and inflation-adjusted U.S. government bond yields.  Besides, the crypto market has been indifferent to recent positive crypto-specific developments like the launch of a stablecoin by PayPal, one of the largest financial services companies in the world and a string of applications for futures-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tied to ether (ETH).  ""Whether that's one of the largest financial services companies in the world launching a stablecoin using public blockchain infrastructure or renewed excitement for futures-based ETH ETFs on the back of a flurry of new applications, both volatility and volume metrics continue to drop to multi-year lows,"" David Lawant, head of research at institutional trading desk FalconX, said in a market update.  ""Overall, while the improving trends and fundamentals in crypto continue to sustain optimism, it's a good time to keep a close eye on any potential spillover impacts from macro to broader risk assets and, by extension, crypto,"" Lawant added.  Bitcoin's renewed downside volatility is consistent with its record of putting interim tops after notable rallies in meme coin SHIB. The self-proclaimed dogecoin-killer surged over 20% in the first 12 days of the month, predominantly on optimism that a layer 2 Shibarium launch would help the cryptocurrency revamp its image as a serious industry player.  Since Aug. 12, the cryptocurrency has pulled back 18%, with prices falling 9% in the past 24 hours alone amid Shibarium's turbulent start. Funding rates in SHIB perpetual futures trading on Binance have crashed to a two-month low of -0.084%, according to data source Coinglass.  The negative figure indicates that shorts are paying longs to keep their bearish positions open.

42419742,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFhwz,1692245228,SHIB Plunges 9% on Apparent Shibarium Bridge Issues,"Shiba inu (SHIB) tokens slumped some 9% in the past 24 hours as users widely reported bridging issues after the much-hyped Shibarium network went live late on Wednesday.  Blockchain data shows transactions on the network were stalled for at least five hours as of time of writing. Users had transferred 954 ether (ETH), worth $1.7 million, and $750,000 worth of bone (BONE), a Shibarium governance token, to the contract.  CoinDesk tried to verify the issue and was unable to bridge tokens to Shibarium.  One of the Shibarium developers responded to reports of an outage in a blog post, stating that ""there is no bridge issue"" and that the problem occurred following a mass influx of transactions.  Users were blocked from sending messages on a community forum on Discord shortly after initial reports of the issues began, CoinDesk confirmed.  Bridges are blockchain-based tools that transfer tokens between different networks. These remain one of the most important – yet a very vulnerable – part of the crypto market.  The apparent faulty launch for Shibarium stutters what was supposed to be the gateway to a vibrant and cheap ecosystem. The network is part of a broader plan to position Shiba Inu as a serious blockchain project, away from the meme coin status it has enjoyed since its August 2020 issuance.  Shibarium joins an increasingly crowded blockchain landscape; there are at least 50 other networks hoping to lure users with low fees to an ecosystem focused mainly on financial services and gaming.  The network utilizes bone (BONE), SHIB and leash (LEASH) tokens for applications built on the blockchain and is said to have a focus on metaverse and gaming applications.  However, each of these tokens was down in the past 24 hours. Bone dropped 13% while LEASH fell 25% as community sentiment soured.

A recent report hints at a potential breakout from the current range, but which side will be favorable by the potential spike in volatility? Related Reading: Bitcoin Speculators Retreat As Long-Term Holders Double Down Since $69,000 Peak As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $28,950 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. Over the previous seven days, the BTC’s price saw a slight downtick recording a 2% loss. Other tokens in the top 10 by market cap are underperforming, with many seeing double-digit losses on low timeframes. The Last Time The Bitcoin Price Saw Low Volatility As seen in the chart below, provided by trading desk QCP Capital in a report, annualized volatility for BTC reached critical levels seen for the first time in over five years. The metric last stood at these levels from late 2018 to 2019. The chart above also shows that volatility fluctuated from the low to the yearly high in a cycle that extended for 2019. At that time, Bitcoin and the crypto market were coming out from a prolonged bear market that, as today, left traders and market participants in shambles and with almost no appetite for risk. QCP Capital noted that from 2018 to 2019, the macroeconomic landscape dominated the Bitcoin price action. At that time, the US Federal Reserve (Fed) hiked interest rates, but the COVID-19 pandemic, which operated as a catalyzer, forced it to reverse. The latter occurred from late 2019 to 2020, when the ease in macroeconomic conditions allowed Bitcoin to soar to a new all-time high. Thus, the trading desk believes that a catalyzer is needed to push the price action back to life: The last time trading was this compressed, it was during the crypto winter of 2018 and 2019, and it took a change in the macro environment to revive the market again. However, they noted that the break of the current low volatility environment is not “imminent.” However, the upcoming decision on a Bitcoin spot Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) in the US could operate as a catalyzer, bringing BTC to its next resistance level at around $34,000, but patience is still required. Related Reading: Bitcoin & Top Assets See High Loss Taking, Is This Bullish? QCP Capital concluded: Will there be a sharp rally that takes us to the 34k resistance – like the prior three times which kissed the support trendline this year?

Valkyrie Ether Futures ETF Include Secure Collateral Investments According to the filed documents on August 16, the proposed ETF will not directly invest in Ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain. Instead, it aims to acquire a portfolio of Ether futures contracts. These contracts are traded on commodity exchanges registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), primarily focusing on contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The value of these futures contracts will be determined by the CME CF Ether Reference Rate, which tracks the price of Ether across selected cash exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin & Top Assets See High Loss Taking, Is This Bullish? Per the filing, the Fund intends to employ a “rolling” strategy to manage the expiration of futures contracts. As contracts approach their expiration date, they will be replaced by similar contracts with later expiration dates. These contracts allow investors to speculate on Ether’s future price movements without owning the digital asset directly. Apart from Ether futures contracts, the Fund will invest its remaining assets in cash, cash-like instruments, or high-quality securities, collectively called “Collateral Investments.” These may include U.S. Government securities, money market funds, and corporate debt securities rated investment grade or comparable quality. Collateral Investments serve the purpose of providing liquidity and satisfying margin requirements for the Fund’s futures portfolio. In addition, the Fund may engage in reverse repurchase agreements to help maintain the desired level of exposure to Ether futures contracts. These factors are expected to position the proposed Ether ETF favorably with the SEC, as it aligns with their requirements. Therefore, there is optimism for a promising decision in support of the Ether ETF application. Options Market Supports BTC And ETH Amid Strong US Economy The strength of the US economy has propelled the US Dollar Index (DXY) to deliver a sharp performance, exerting continued pressure on the cryptocurrency market. However, despite liquidity challenges, the gradual decline in Bitcoin (BTC) and ETH prices has not exceeded expectations. Fortunately, the options market continues providing substantial price support for BTC and ETH, ensuring stability without external liquidity. Digital asset management platform Blofin has closely analyzed the options market and identified significant factors contributing to the ongoing support for BTC and ETH. Positive gamma has impacted BTC, “sticking” its price around the $29,000 mark. Similarly, for ETH, market makers’ hedging behavior around the $1,800 strike price has also provided support, preventing a steeper decline in its price. Despite the overall support from the options market, Blofin’s analysis reveals a discrepancy in the sentiment of block traders towards BTC and ETH. Related Reading: Shiba Inu DAO Gets Serious With New Advisory And Investment Firm Block traders, who typically execute large-volume trades, believe more strongly in BTC’s resilience than ETH. This preference may stem from BTC’s established position as the leading cryptocurrency and its reputation as a reliable store of value. Overall, Blofin’s analysis underscores the crucial role the options market plays in supporting BTC and ETH amid liquidity pressures. The positive gamma effect and market makers’ hedging actions have contributed to maintaining the stability of both cryptocurrencies. As of the time of writing, the second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of trading volume is trading at $1,825. Following in the footsteps of Bitcoin, Ethereum has experienced a 0.8% decline over the past 24 hours, further extending its downward trend over the past 30 days, resulting in a 4% decline during that period.
