42378799,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lmKF,1467236619,Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust Moves Filing to BATS Exchange,"The Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust is no longer attempting to list on Nasdaq, according to an SEC document filed today.  After three years of waiting for regulatory approval from the Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC), the Trust’s founders, investors Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, have changed tack and are now seeking to list the product on the BATS Global Exchange.  Notably, the Winklevoss brothers have also increased the size of the offering, from $20m to $65m, a move that would boost the maximum price of shares offered to retail investors.  If the SEC approves the request, the Trust would be the first bitcoin investment vehicle to be approved by the federal regulatory body. While the Winklevoss brothers await the go-ahead, the Trust isn’t their only digital currency investment on the market.  Last month, their Gemini digital currency exchange announced it had launched ether trading, while expanding services to the UK and Canada.  The moves come as Gemini has arguably struggled to gain market share in the BTC/USD trading space, where it trails rivals Coinbase and itBit.  The Trust’s sponsor is Digital Asset Services, LLC, a Delaware-based limited liability company formed in 2013, and wholly-owned by Winklevoss Capital Management, LLC.

42378811,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lmgt,1467233780,"For Ether Investors, All Eyes Remain on Divisive Fork Debate","The price of ether, the native currency that powers the blockchain platform ethereum, sank yesterday following an Ethereum Foundation blog post that pointed out a flaw in a proposed plan meant to rescue funds lost in an attack on one of its signature projects, The DAO.  The flaw would leave the distributed organization open to a denial of service (DOS) attack, and fears of such an event have driven ether prices lower, according to traders.  Ether prices fell to as little as $11.60 during yesterday's session, down roughly 17% from their opening price of $13.95, Poloniex figures reveal. The digital currency later recovered, opening at $12.18 on 29th June and rising to a press time total of $12.69.  Still, the event showcases the sensitivity in the market to the current situation, which could find ethereum developers taking divisive steps to return funds to investors.  Members of the ethereum development community have been scrambling to find a solution to the hack that resulted in the theft of 3.6m ether tokens since it occurred almost two weeks ago. One potential solution that has generated visibility is a soft fork that would attempt to blacklist the address holding the confiscated funds, though it now appears unlikely as miners have largely stopped voting for the proposal.  At this point, it looks uncertain ""whether they'll even be able to put together a sufficiently safe soft fork in the limited weeks they have,"" algorithmic trader Jacob Eliosoff told CoinDesk. As a result, many are leaning toward either implementing a hard fork solution or simply letting the hacker keep the funds, he added.  Sources point to the event as contributing to ""uncertainty"" in ethereum's market, which could continue for weeks.  Due to provisions in The DAO's coding, the attacker is currently prohibited from spending the confiscated funds, a safety mechanism that remains in place, but only until 14th July.  Charles L.

42378806,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lmWp,1467222637,Why Ethereum Needs 'Dumb' Contracts,"Daniel Cawrey is head of communications at Velocity, an autonomous derivatives project utilizing smart contracts and built on the ethereum blockchain.  In this opinion piece, Cawrey discusses the recent demise of The DAO and how that impacts the future of smart contracts, the technology on which the short-lived fund was based.  ""The two things to know about smart contracts is that they’re dumb, and they’re not contracts.""  This statement from Harvard Berkman Center's Patrick Murck seems increasingly relevant in the wake of the collapse of The DAO. The ethereum-based fund was the largest smart contract issued to date, and its failure has led many to reconsider how ready the technology is for primetime.  At their core, smart contracts facilitate decentralized applications by eliminating trust points. Because they automate existing processes, many believe smart contracts could someday lower costs across industries.  However, all that promise isn’t without possible problems.  This is especially true when it comes to smart contracts being built on ethereum, currently viewed as the standard platform for the creation of smart contracts.  Debate is now necessary should the ethereum community want to move forward in improving both its technology and governance structure to support the aims of entrepreneurs and users.  Breaking the system  Ever since the invention of computers, hackers and attackers have been breaking systems by exploiting code.  This trial-by-fire approach to development can arguably be seen as the reason behind the multimillion-dollar attack on The DAO. Though it was the first major achievement in blockchain smart contracts, The DAO attack exposed weaknesses in ethereum’s scripting language that could discourage further efforts.  In total, the attack resulted in 3.6m ether being taken from The DAO, currently worth about $50m. Rather than a theft, the attack appears rooted in exposing the idea ethereum's code is not yet production-ready. This has indeed proved effective. Since the attack, numerous articles displaying flaws in ethereum and its programming language, Solidity, have appeared.  There’s obviously been talk about The DAO attack's ""recursive call"" issue. Further, the Solar Stormhttps://blog.blockstack.org/solar-storm-a-serious-security-exploit-with-ethereum-not-just-the-dao-a03d797d98fa exploit and several other bugs in the system are now out in public due to the efforts of security researchers.  This shows there is a lot of work to do to make ethereum smart contracts more secure. But, this will require community effort and a more immediate decision as to whether the blockchain will fork as part of an effort to recover the funds.  Dumb contracts  There’s work to be done in making ethereum’s smart contacts ready for the real world.  For example, ethereum smart contract code was designed to remain immutable or unchanged. This makes the system difficult, but not impossible, when it comes to upgrading code.  On one hand, this make sense. Contractual agreements, once signed, cannot simply be revoked. However, software systems are upgraded all the time. This dichotomy is perhaps the main reason why, almost 20 years since Nick Szabo first proposed the idea of smart contracts, they still have not been implemented into the existing legal system.  In law, loopholes are often found in agreements that are then exploited. This is not unlike what has happened with The DAO. Therefore, careful consideration must be taken when creating smart contracts.  ""Code is law"" sounds like a great motto until flaws are found.  It’s clear simple smart contracts are ideal smart contracts because of ethereum’s design. Building automated governance in the way The DAO wanted sounds great on paper, but it seems it's better to deploy smaller, interrelated smart contracts instead of a larger one.  Governance and transparency  Cryptocurrency-based technology is unique – many get on a hype train and don’t consider the long-term implications.  Ethereum’s price, along with profit expectations of The DAO, have certainly fueled this, as both projects used tokens with a monetary value to fund their efforts.  As a result, conversations on governance must be had, as there is a danger that the situation will encourage an opaque structure where community members aren’t sure who is in control. This type of configuration wouldn’t be different from the less than transparent systems ethereum attempts to displace.  Right now, only a few stakeholders seem to gain from cryptocurrency platforms, though this isn't just an issue with ethereum. For example, if there had been better governance in bitcoin, specific standards bodies would have been implemented to properly define the purpose of BTC, its unit of account.  If nothing is done, the same type of infighting over the mere definition of ethereum might happen.  Is ethereum a smart contract platform? Is it the correct system for deploying decentralized applications? Is it a store of value? A payment currency?  Varying definitions plagued bitcoin up until the point where using it as a fast means of payment has become almost impossible. Ethereum could experience similar issues if proper governance isn’t established.  Road ahead  An optimist would hope infighting won’t destroy Ethereum.  Many are closely observing what will occur over the next few weeks and months. Still, it’s hard to be pessimistic.  There’s still a great future for smart contracts and open blockchains. Ethereum has a place – if its smart contract technology can be properly refined and governance is ironed out.  In the cryptocurrency ecosystem, technology is flirting with fascinating concepts in finance and economics. Bitcoin was obviously the first to do this, a reboot of the definition of value.  Programmatic agreements move this industry into deeper, even more intriguing territory. Prior to Ethereum, there wasn’t an open system for properly implementing agreements in code. Smart contracts on ethereum do work. The DAO proved this – yet it also showed it still requires a good amount of refinement for production use.  Simple smart contracts paired with an open blockchain could improve the legal system by increasing efficiencies and further democratizing law.  But this isn't likely to happen quite yet, not until the technology and a distributed structure of control is properly figured out.  Right now, ethereum is the standard smart contract platform, but without a proper path forward, an upstart could easily arrive to replace it and pave the way.

42378812,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lmbr,1467219982,This A16z Startup is Building a 'Virtual Galaxy' for Bitcoin Nodes,"Some have said that bitcoin can be thought of as digital property, akin to a kind of virtual gold. If so, this description then raises the question – can technology be used to create entirely digital landscapes?  The developers behind a project called Urbit have spent much of the past decade trying to answer that question. It's through this concept that the project, developed by a startup called Tlon, has attracted support from Silicon Valley powerhouses like Andreessen Horowitz and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel.  Urbit is a network of personal cloud computers that, according to its founders, aims to create a means through which individuals can run their own servers without having to go through the trouble of running complicated server infrastructure.  Described by its creators as a ""virtual city"", the project dates back to the mid-2000s and is the the brainchild of Curtis Yarvin, a programmer who has stoked controversy in the past for his ""neo-reactionary"" political writings under the pen name Mencius Moldbug. Despite attracting criticism over the years, the project is pushing ahead, and last night completed an initial sale of sever addresses.  So what does this have to do with bitcoin and blockchain?  As its online documentation makes clear, Urbit itself does not use an actual blockchain (though it does share some kinship through its peer-to-peer network). Yet in the project’s white paper, bitcoin itself is frequently invoked, and in interview, Tlon co-founder Galen Wolfe-Pauly argued that Urbit could become an ideal platform for running bitcoin nodes and distributed apps.  Wolfe-Pauly told CoinDesk:  ""A blockchain is more useful when the nodes are run by actual users. Coinbase is cool, but it would be great if there was an easy way to run a full node. Urbit is well-suited to solve that problem.""  What it looks like  The project is composed of several parts: a virtual machine (dubbed ""Nock""), an operating system (""Arvo""), a programming language (""Hoon"") and a peer-to-peer network (""Ames"").  The Urbit white paper invokes galactic imagery to describe how identities are then organized within its hierarchy. From “galaxies” to ""stars"" to “comets”, Urbit is envisioned as a virtual universe, and this extends to how identities are further generated.  As for how you actually interact with your Urbit, Wolfe-Pauly said that it depends on user preferences. Portability, he went on to say, is a key element of its design.  ""You would install Urbit locally and you could either pay someone to host it for you in the cloud or easily host it yourself in the cloud,” he explained. “Or, if you were really concerned about privacy, it’s really easy to install it on an old Linux box and put it in your closet.”  The project is still very much in its early stages.  Wolfe-Pauly told CoinDesk that for now, it’s primarily developers who would be interested in using Urbit. As it stands, the project exists in testnet form and can be downloaded today.  Bitcoin and Urbit  In addition to its peer-to-peer nature, Urbit shares bitcoin’s concept of resource scarcity. Identities on the network are artificially restricted, and earlier this week, the team sold 1,020 Urbit “stars” for $256 apiece, netting the project $209,100.  As the crowdsale progressed – it sold out over the course of several hours – bitcoin startup 21 Inc CEO and A16Z board member Balaji Srinivasan drew a comparison between bitcoin and Urbit, arguing that ""if IP addresses were P2P tradeable like bitcoin, they'd be Urbit address space"".  But the similarities, if they can be called that, start to end here.  As it exists today, Urbit doesn’t share the globally distributed nature of bitcoin, and as its white paper outlines, the hierarchical structure of the Urbit “universe” differs from the even playing-field model espoused in Satoshi Nakamoto’s bitcoin paper.  As it exists today, Urbit is largely centralized (owing to its nascent deployment), though Wolfe-Pauly says that, should its ecosystem grow, the overall structure of Urbit’s network should become more distributed.

42399086,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiNf6,1467216637,Specter of Ethereum Hard Fork Worries Australian Banking Group,"Everywhere the ethereum community looks for a solution to the collapse of The DAO, obstacles lay in its path.  After news yesterday that a proposed soft fork solution carried with it a previously unidentified exploit, we're now seeing an example of the kinds of objections Ethereum may face if a proposed hard fork is implemented.  Speaking today at the Blockchain Summit in Melbourne, Australia, ANZ Banking Group’s executive manager, Nicholas Groves said that the incident has highlighted the importance of ""who controls a public blockchain"".  According to a Financial Review report, groves added:  ""Had we been running something on ethereum that was not the DAO and everything got rolled back, we'd potentially lose two weeks of stuff and for a bank that's quite risky.""  Concerns over a hard fork that would roll-back transactions to restore funds lost in the attack on the ethereum-based fund have been percolating since earlier this month, but the reaction by ANZ is the first we’ve seen by a global banking institution.  However, this isn’t the first time ANZ has expressed skepticism about the technology.  For example, in May, AMZ’s general manager of global digital technology, Christiain Vente, wrote an article on the company’s blog about nine reasons banks aren't using blockchain.

42399080,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiNZC,1467207264,Chinese Yuan Devaluation Fails to Fuel Bitcoin Price Rally,"The connection between the Chinese yuan and the price of bitcoin appears to be weakening.  Despite assertions that macroeconomic fears in China are one factor boosting the price of bitcoin, the nation's recent decision to lower the yuan’s currency peg by the largest amount since August notably failed to cause a significant change in the digital currency’s price this week.  Arguably almost entirely driven by long-term bullishness and sentiment, it's become a passtime of bitcoin industry observers to attempt to correlate movements in the market with larger, macroeconomic trends, and China has become a particular point of focus given the outsized activity on local exchanges.  Still, in practice it remains to be seen whether this relationship is effective marketing or a sound indicator for traders, and this week's events provided the latest data point in this ongoing exploration.  On 27th June, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) reduced the yuan’s peg to¥6.6375 per dollar, which represented a 0.9% drop, Bloomberg reported. By 10:44 UTC, China’s currency had fallen ¥0.3% to 6.6473.  As a result, the yuan-dollar exchange rate was close to its lowest since December 2010.  However, in the wake of these events, the price of bitcoin hardly moved, fluctuating primarily between $630 and $660 on 27th June and falling into an even tighter range between $640 and $660 on 28th June, CoinDesk’s USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) revealed.  When the 29th June session began, the digital currency opened at $646.30, 2.5% higher than its opening value of $630.25 on 27th June.  In contrast, bitcoin prices surged 8.7% on 24th June, additional BPI data shows, when the yuan hit a five-and-one-half-year low against the dollar, an event mainstream news outlets like CNBC sought to correlate with economic activity in China.  Evidence and speculation  When asked by CoinDesk, market experts had different interpretations of bitcoin’s recent stability in the face of a falling yuan currency peg.  Petar Zivkovski, director of operations for bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, went so far as to to proclaim that the idea yuan devaluation has any meaningful impact on price is ""mostly a myth"".  He added that while it has been used widely by the mainstream media, his firm sees ""no evidence"" of this occurring.  ""Bitcoin is a purely speculative asset,"" Zivkovski asserted, adding: ""Any news of a yuan devaluation, news which is becoming more expected and less surprising to the market, is merely used by traders as a pretext to buy, rather than actually driving any real demand by Chinese yuan holders.”  Another expert who spoke to the role of psychology in the market was Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of bitcoin leverage trading platform BitMEX. Hayes contends that while China's actions increase sentiment, it's with international traders, not local buyers.  ""The PBOC devaluation is an overarching narrative that influences traders' bullish or bearish sentiment,"" he said, adding:  ""Chinese people are not buying bitcoin en masse to escape capital controls.""  Temporary volatility  Past that, both Zivkovksi and Hayes spoke to temporary volatility, emphasizing how prices have fluctuated before quickly falling back or reverting to the norm.  Hayes provided some insight into the currency’s sustained price fluctuations, emphasizing how high volatility has been over the past few months.  As for where bitcoin will go in the near future, market experts who spoke with CoinDesk did not seem particularly bullish.  After enjoying a “meteoric” climb in the last few months, bitcoin is currently “under profit-taking pressure,” Zivkovski told CoinDesk.  Further, Zivkovski said this week's events provide evidence that the situation in China may not be strong enough to encourage new gains.  ""The last three times China devalued its currency, including a couple of days ago, bitcoin's price rose temporarily but quickly faded as the market mean reverted to previous price levels,” said Zivkovksi.  He continued:  ""This is an indication that yuan devaluation news is not powerful enough to reverse a trend and sustain a new one.”  Charles L.

42399088,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiNi3,1467204014,Bitcoin Impact Unlikely as Chinese Legislators Draft 'Virtual Property' Law,"The National People’s Congress, the national legislature of China, has released draft text for a civil law code that, if implemented, would provide a legal definition for virtual property.  Following the announcement yesterday, reports began emerging that the definition could extend to blockchain-based assets including bitcoin and other digital currencies, with such speculation being set off by communications from local OTC trading firm BitKan.  However, Broad and Bright partner Roland Sun, a legal lead for blockchain consortium ChinaLedger, is now asserting that the text in question contains no specific reference to digital currencies or bitcoin, a fact other local sources indicated.  In interview, Sun said the law is rather designed to address longstanding disputes related to the theft of properties available in online gaming.  Though he acknowledged the definition could be expanded to include digital currencies, he said there is a ""long way to go"" before such a legal definition could be enacted.  Sun told CoinDesk:  ""I don’t expect a firm legislative recognition of the property rights of cryptocurrency [holders] in the next five or six years.""  However, he said it is ""a matter of time"" before Chinese lawmakers will need to make a decision on how to classify digital currencies, thereby following in the footsteps of regulators in the US, Australia, the UK and Japan that have been among the more progressive internationally on the issue.
