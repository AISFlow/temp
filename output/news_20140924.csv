42426123,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIiRzh,1411598242,Will Bitcoin Meet Napster's Fate?,"Seemingly out of nowhere, a technology appears that changes the way people think about an established industry. Vested interests see it as a threat and become determined to ensure it does not undercut existing profit structures.  Sounds like the synopsis of the story about bitcoin up to this point? Well, yes, but digital currency isn't the first technology to meet the resistance of incumbent parties.  The music industry, for example, faced a signifcant threat from peer-to-peer technology in the late 1990s. In fact, 15 years ago, controversial file-sharing service Napster was one of the biggest stories around.  The company's peer-to-peer technology enabled users to connect to vast music libraries stored on hard drives around the globe, and then download those files with the click of a mouse. More than a decade later, the music industry hasn't been the same since.  Of course, even at its peak, there was widespread agreement among market observers that Napster had changed the face of music. But, besieged by lawsuits, Napster today survives only as a shadow of its former self. Instead, business interests took advantage of its legal troubles, legitimized the technology and profited from it.  The result could provide an interesting history lesson for bitcoin, illustrating what happens to incumbents when rivals look for ways to innovate a novel idea out of existence.  The streaming model  While Napster provided a revolutionary way for people to use peer-to-peer connections to download music, the problem was that it essentially freed published works from record label control.  Napster allowed anyone to obtain music – that others previously had to pay for – absolutely free. It's demise ultimately helped Apple dominate the music downloading industry, and later gave rise to streaming music platforms like Pandora and Spotify in what has become an increasingly important model for the sector.  At its peak, Napster had 60 million users and, despite its controversial business model, even raised millions from investors, though this did not protect it from a subsequent and very public lawsuit.  The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), music publishing’s trade and enforcement group, took great umbrage at the idea of people not paying proper licensing fees for music. There were also prominent musicians who did not like the idea of free music, although many figured that something like Napster was inevitable.  Eventually, Napster was forced to cease operations by the RIAA, which filed a lawsuit for copyright infringement, and its remains were later bought out by another company.  All of this is captured in the movie Downloaded, which, in the spirit of its subject, is available online for free.  Copyright vs government control  Ultimately, Napster's story shows what can happen when industries face the threat of decentralization and lower-cost pricing structures.  Because of bitcoin, financial technology could evolve similarly, developing into a model where everyone pays for access to a worldwide financial network in a way that echoes streaming music.  “[Downloaded is] a very interesting movie,” said Fabio Federici, whose startup Coinalytics tracks bitcoin-related data. However, he added, “there’s no copyright on the dollar bill”.  The parallel between music and money does end in that there are different legal protections involved. For recorded music, it’s protected under copyright law.  Money, in turn, is protected by various governments that for a multitude of reasons want to protect sovereign currencies. Is that more or less dangerous than copyright law? It depends on where you live. In the US, the federal government has taken the stance it can ardently compete with digital currencies such as bitcoin.  David Andolfatto, vice president at the Federal Reserve and a professor at Simon Fraser University, told an audience in St. Louis last April:  “I think that the Federal Reserve can compete with bitcoin as a currency.”  Andolfatto conceded at the time there are technical aspects native to bitcoin that the US central bank cannot compete against. He specifically pointed out the payments rail bitcoin has as having global applications beyond the dollar.  Creative destruction and innovation  Aside from music and finance, other industries are being disrupted, and in the process, are having to confront regulatory standards that may be antiquated. Napster is just one company that fought an entrenched industry, experiencing opposition. Bitcoin may face even bigger scrutiny.  Even multibillion-dollar companies like Uber, which seeks to provide better transportation services through technology, or Airbnb, which has developed a way to obtain lodging via excess housing surplus previously unavailable, are not immune to obstacles.  The battles that these startups are having in their respective industries may only be a proverbial drop in the bucket for what decentralized digital assets such as bitcoin may face.  While providing new consumer convenience, Uber has displaced scores of taxi drivers. This is due to its lower barriers of entry versus the high overall costs it takes to operate and license a cab.  In Airbnb's instance, its platform causes regulatory issues in locations where commercial lodging is not permitted in residential areas. This is true despite what some Airbnb hosts may think about the ability to rent out unused living space.  To date, bitcoin's volatility problems have arguably brought it the most regulatory scrutiny. Further, bitcoin competes directly with government money, which can be grounds for outright prohibition in some places.  This has included Bolivia and Ecuador, though local groups are trying to change the legal standing of digital currency in their jurisdictions.  Could bitcoin become the Napster of money? The answer depends on how you view the question. Napster has certainly had a impact, but it failed to ever live up to its potential as a business. As such, the company's history may provide an important warning for the bitcoin industry.  Bitcoin could potentially be replaced by something else, something more favorable to governments and banks worldwide – something Apple Pay, ironically enough, is already trying to accomplish.

42397950,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEp2l,1411589933,"BitFlyer Deal Brings Bitcoin Option to 48,000 Online Stores in Japan","GMO Payment Gateway (GMO-PG) has partnered with bitFlyer to provide its 48,000 online merchants the option to accept bitcoin starting later this year.  Founded in 1995, GMO-PG specializes in providing payment services to e-commerce platforms and mobile content providers. Data from Forbes suggests that the company, a subsidiary of the larger GMO Internet, nets $61m in annual sales and has a market capitalization of $374m.  BitFlyer CEO Yuzo Kano framed the partnership as a ""business-and-capital alliance"" that will result in the creation a first-of-its-kind bitcoin settlement service in Japan, while creating a safer and more convenient domestic e-commerce environment.  Kano explained:  ""This service will enable miscellaneous goods such as consumer electronics devices offered by Internet-based virtual retailers, digital content such as music and games, and other items to be purchased using bitcoin.""  GMO-PG currently has more than 48,000 merchant customers, all of which will have the ability to start accepting bitcoin this November when the payment method will be fully enabled.  In addition to its partnership with bitFlyer, GMO-PG has also made an undisclosed investment in the Japan-based bitcoin exchange. BitFlyer previously raised $1.6m in July with the goal of becoming the leading player in bitcoin's now-burgeoning market in Japan.  Early Internet giant supports bitcoin  GMO-PG's parent company GMO Internet has aimed to provide a one-stop solution for entrepreneurs seeking to start online businesses in Japan since 1991. As such, GMO is often positioned as an alternative to consumer e-commerce giant Rakuten, but for the Asian nation's business market.  GMO sells domain names, provides web hosting and security services and allows its online merchant customers accept a wide variety of payment methods – including credit cards, bank transfers and soon bitcoin – through GMO-PG.  The embrace of bitcoin also comes at a time when GMO is seeking to expand its influence beyond its home market to others in Southeast Asia. However, it faces competition from Alibaba's popular Alipay service, which notably struck a deal with Rakuten in April to enable its payment option on Rakuten's platforms.  Rakuten itself has been publicly positive about bitcoin, with CEO Hiroshi Mikitani voicing his support for the technology this July.  bitFlyer moves for market dominance  The move is also the latest from bitFlyer that finds it establishing itself as a leading force in Japan's still nascent bitcoin ecosystem.  Founded in January of this year, bitFlyer has worked to quickly set itself apart. Key to that has been CEO Kano's own narrative, as he left his former employer, Goldman Sachs, to start the company last year.  Though the market has seen a number of notable exchange launches in recent months, all companies are operating in the shadow of Mt. Gox, the now-defunct Japan-based exchange that colored early public perception in the country.  Still, this isn't stopping bitFlyer from moving aggressively to capture the market. For example, the startup recently launched Japan's first bitcoin crowdfunding platform, fundFlyer, a platform that takes aim at more established crowdfunding services such as Kickstarter and Japan's popular alternative Shooting Star.

42397952,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEp1m,1411572335,FTC: Butterfly Labs Case Not Part of 'War on Bitcoin',"The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced yesterday that it had shut down Butterfly Labs following approval by a US judge, and for many outraged customers, the closure is the end of a long period of uncertainty.  Though initially a market leader in the bitcoin mining space, the last few months of the Missouri-based company’s operations were defined by manufacturing delays, troubled public image efforts and looming legal problems.  Speaking to CoinDesk, FTC attorney Leah Frazier, who works for the agency’s Division of Financial Practices, said that the investigation began after it received a groundswell of consumer complaints. The FTC itself serves as a repository for US consumers who wish to report instances of fraud, identity theft or unfair business practices, though it cannot resolve individual complaints.  Frazier said that the investigation into Butterfly Labs had less to do with its involvement in the digital currency industry, and was more about uncovering whether a US business was engaging in illegal activities. Ultimately, she said that Butterfly Labs failed to meet the commitments it made to its customers.  Frazier explained:  “Even though the case involves bitcoin, [the investigation] is about a company that made misrepresentations to consumers about when machines would be delivered and failed to delivery by that time or deliver at all.”  Representatives from the mining product manufacturer issued a statement contesting both the closure and the agency’s characterization of Butterfly Labs as a “bogus” company. Further, it called the move part of the agency's forthcoming ""war on bitcoin"", which it predicted would begin with its company.  Asset seizure underway  The FTC has indicated that Butterfly Labs' assets have been temporarily frozen until a 29th September hearing. The 10-day restraining order could be extended, during which time investigators will continue developing their case against Butterfly Labs.  Notably, the FTC revealed that the Butterfly Labs leadership – composed of board members Darla Drake, Sonny Vleisides and Nasser Ghoseiri – may have collected as much as $50m in customer funds for products that were never delivered.  During a Twitter Q&A, one user asked if the FTC was investigating allegations that Butterfly Labs owns secret bitcoin wallets. The agency said only that it was “tracing the company’s assets”.  Refund interruption fears  The FTC's move to freeze the company's finances has raised concerns regarding the future of its refund payments, which many customers are still seeking.  Frazier told CoinDesk that currently, all funds previously in control of Butterfly Labs are being held until the hearing later this month.  She said:  “The accounts are frozen right now and the receiver is in control of the business. So, we can’t make any predictions on an ongoing basis as to the status of the refunds. A lot of that will hinge on the court’s decision.”  When asked if the move to place the company in receivership was in the best interest of the company’s customers, Frazier noted that Butterfly Labs hadn’t made good on its promises to issue refunds to date.  Butterfly Labs refutes closure  Hours after the FTC action was announced, Butterfly Labs went on the offensive to denounce the US government agency, alleging that it “acted as judge, jury and executioner” by freezing its assets.  Butterfly Labs explained:  “Butterfly Labs is being portrayed by the FTC as a bogus and fake company. To the contrary, Butterfly Labs is very real. As pointed out in court filings Butterfly Labs made last night, Butterfly Labs has shipped more than $33m in products to customers and voluntarily granted refunds approximating $17m to customers for cancelled orders.”  The company said that, prior to being shutdown by the FTC, it was in the process of sending out shipments and filing refunds “when the FTC effectively closed the doors of Butterfly Labs without any chance to be heard in court”.  When asked if the FTC was in effect calling Butterfly Labs a fraudulent company, Frazier said that the agency acted based on how the business was behaving toward its customers.  She concluded:  “We just look at the misrepresentations that the company makes [to] consumers and whether, ultimately, it fulfilled the promises it made. So, whether or not the company is bogus or a scam isn’t the issue. The issue is about whether they accurately represent information that would be material to consumers making decisions.”  Image credit: Cvandyke / Shutterstock.com",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/09/24/ftc-butterfly-labs-case-not-part-of-war-on-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4177ed5222d54ad52c54125a09c0cf92f4818c62-1609x781.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397948,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEp0n,1411570612,Liberty Reserve IT Manager Pleads Guilty to Money Laundering Charges,"A Costa Rican man who served as the former IT manager for now-defunct early digital currency company Liberty Reserve has pleaded guilty to operating an illegal and unlicensed money transmitting business.  On Tuesday, 28-year-old Maxim Chukharev appeared before US District Judge Denise Cote to enter the latest plea in the case. Six of his co-workers have been charged with crimes related to the operations of Liberty Reserve, and three have pleaded guilty to date.  Prosecutors said Chukharev played a crucial role in maintaining the company’s technological infrastructure, which authorities estimate was used to process $6bn in transactions.  The news marks the latest development in the case of Liberty Reserve, which was shut down in May 2013 following a money laundering investigation conducted by US and Costa Rican law enforcement. The case is still widely cited by US authorities as a reason digital currency companies should be required to perform enhanced due diligence on customers.  Co-founder Vladimir Kats pleaded guilty to a litany of charges in connection with his involvement in the company last November and faces 75 years behind bars.  Chukharev's sentencing hearing is scheduled for 30th January, 2015. He faces a maximum five-year prison sentence.  'Bank of choice' for criminals  The US Department of Justice (DOJ) denounced the company, evoking strong language in an official release, and asserting its belief that Liberty Reserve was created to allow cybercriminals to distribute illegal goods and launder illicit gains.  The statement reads:  ""Liberty Reserve was used extensively for illegal purposes, functioning as the bank of choice for the criminal underworld because it provided an infrastructure that enabled cybercriminals around the world to conduct anonymous and untraceable financial transactions.""  Liberty Reserve's closure was similarly championed by some early bitcoin advocates, who argued that the shut down would help to decouple the digital currency from connections with illicit businesses.  Impact on bitcoin's perception  Although Liberty Reserve has been inactive for some time, the company has had a lasting impact on the perception of digital currency in the eyes of US law enforcement, owing to its status as one of the largest money laundering prosecutions in history.  The case was notably evoked during New York's 'BitLicense' hearings earlier this year by Cyrus R Vance, Jr, District Attorney of New York County and Richard B Zabel, Deputy US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, who appeared before NYDFS superintendent Benjamin Lawsky to speak about the need for enhanced oversight of digital currency businesses.  In contrast to bitcoin's open network, Liberty Reserve was a closed platform that featured its own native digital currency called the Liberty Reserve or LR. The company has been credited with promoting early interest in bitcoin, as the digital currency was a method used to buy bitcoin at early exchanges.

42397966,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEpAd,1411567230,Two Words That Explain the Price Movements of Bitcoin,"The price of bitcoin increased yesterday following the news that PayPal would integrate the digital currency into its services for merchants. However, the price is still down approximately 50% compared with the start of the year.  Everyone in the bitcoin space is now looking for answers as to why the price has dropped so much from its $1,100 peak in December 2013. In the absence of any new specific information, the simplest answer is the best, and can be summed up in two words: asset allocation.  Simply put, there have been better places to invest since the price started dipping from a relative high in June and July.  Below is a chart of the bitcoin price since it reached that high, versus competing asset classes:  As you can see, the S&P 500 (orange), the Dow 30 (yellow), and the US dollar (red) have all outperformed bitcoin since June, but it's really been the case all year, as the S&P is up 8.8% year to date, and the Dow is up 4.67% year to date.  In other words, money flows to where it can increase, and selling begets more selling in what forms a classic negative feedback loop. As bitcoin keeps going lower, more selling will occur, especially among retailers and miners.  The prevailing attitude is 'why should I hold it today if it will be worth less tomorrow?'. This will continue to be the attitude until proper hedging occurs using various derivative products or the price of bitcoin goes into a sustained uptrend.  USD vs bitcoin  Below is a five-year chart of the US dollar and, as you can see, it is reaching new highs:  The US dollar has significantly outperformed bitcoin since June and July. In fact, the US dollar and bitcoin should be negatively correlated as they are competing assets and 'alternative' forms of currency.  There are many reasons for the US dollar's strength, including:  The end of QE (quantitative easing) by the Federal Reserve in October and the perception of rising interest rates in the US.  The perception of a strong domestic economy.  Money inflows from European countries as their economies have once more started showing signs of contracting.  Money inflows from pound sterling. This could have been related to worries over Scottish secession from the UK, which did not in the end go ahead.  If the US dollar weakens that should be positive for bitcoin.  Future outlook  If a stock market correction happens, money outflowing from equities will look for other asset classes to allocate to. Hence, money could flow towards under-performing assets, such as bitcoin, emerging markets and hard and soft commodities.  Some in the bitcoin community have speculated that the Alibaba IPO has been one of the reasons for the price decline. This could be seen as a positive, though, as all those who were allocated shares at $68 will probably be selling their shares after making a 32% profit very quickly and put that money to use elsewhere.  There is an old rule on Wall Street, as is highlighted in Joe Granville’s book New Strategy of Daily Stock Market Timing for Maximum Profit: “Stocks do not rise in price unless demand exceeds supply. Demand is measured in volume and thus volume must precede price.”  Volume also generally precedes news, as does price. If you are looking for the downtrend to end, keep an eye on volume. If you see it rising (along with price) on good news than accumulation has begun.  To end on a timely note, if we look at bitcoin seasonality, the period beginning in October has seen the price rise in previous years. Perhaps that is a pattern we will see repeated this year.

42397949,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEoyp,1411562052,US Banks Announce Ripple Protocol Integration,"Ripple Labs has sealed new partnerships that will bring its Ripple protocol to two US banks.  According to the company’s 24th September announcement, Kansas-based CBW Bank and Cross River Bank, located in New Jersey, will be the first American banks to adopt Ripple's open-source distributed transaction infrastructure.  The news comes several months after Ripple inked its first deal with the banking sector, when German bank Fidor became the first institution of its kind to integrate the Ripple protocol. Like Fidor, CBW Bank and Cross River Bank will now be able to tap Ripple’s low-cost currency transfer and remittance capabilities.  According to Ripple CEO Chris Larsen, the perception that banks are fighting against open-source technologies like the Ripple or bitcoin protocols isn't accurate. Rather, he said, these institutions recognize the promise, but are naturally conservative when it comes to strategic change.  Larsen told CoinDesk:  “Obviously banks are really cautious about any new technology, regulations are very complex. But, at the same time, I think they are seeing that these technologies can solve a real problem that we have in our value exchange system, both globally and domestically.”  Enhanced banking  Many banks, especially in the United States, continue to be apprehensive about working with bitcoin companies, to the point that some startups struggle to access banking services as a result. Yet some, like CBW and Cross River, are looking at distributed transaction-settlement technologies as a way to bring their business models into the 21st century.  Gilles Gade, CEO and president of Cross River, said in a statement that its partnership with Ripple enables it to test next-generation payment infrastructures while remaining compliant with US law.  He noted:  “Our business customers expect banking to move at the speed of the Web, but with the security and confidence of the traditional financial system. Ripple will help make that a reality, enabling our customers to instantly transfer funds internationally while meeting all compliance requirements and payments rules.”  According to Larsen, banks are interested in, but not driven to adopt, the technology’s application as a currency. However, the ability to settle transactions denominated in major currencies in real time is a powerful proposition that has prompted some banks, like Cross River and CBW, to begin moving slowly but surely toward integrating systems like Ripple.  “That’s solving a real need and the banks get that,” he said.  Technology boosting operations  Banks are open to the idea of adopting frameworks such as Ripple’s because the industry recognizes it needs to move faster and more securely.  CBW chairman and chief technology officer Suresh Ramamurthi commented that the banking industry is held back by “antiquated” business practices and technology. He characterized the current banking transaction process by saying:  “Today’s banks offer the equivalent of 300-year old paper ledgers converted to an electronic form – a digital skin on an antiquated transaction process.”  He went on to say that Ripple “addresses these problems” to provide fast, compliant transactions.  Ripple CEO Larsen told CoinDesk that the process of working to onboard banks has, in a way, reshaped the company’s approach to expansion. He said that, right now, the company is in an “infrastructure building phase” which aims to improve liquidity in the Ripple system by connecting more banks around the world to the protocol.

42397947,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEoxq,1411555488,CoinJar to Charge No Fees for New Bitcoin Debit Card,"Australia's CoinJar has announced pricing for its new 'Swipe' debit cards, which allow users to load and spend funds from their bitcoin balances at any business in Australia's widespread EFTPOS electronic debit network.  CoinJar  , which launched the trial of its regional-first card product last week, is promising ""no activation fees, no load fees, no conversion rates (subject to CoinJar Fair Rate policy), [and] no inactivity fees"".  Users will still face some costs, however. Ordering the card initially costs AUD$29 ($26). Additionally, cash withdrawals from ATMs on Australia's 'Redi-ATM' network incur a AUD$2 ($1.78) fee, but users can withdraw cash for free if using the cards at either of the nationwide Coles or Woolworths supermarket chains.  CoinJar is waiving the $29 initial fee during the trial period.  ""CoinJar will be absorbing these costs because we want our users to experience the power of bitcoin and spend it freely,"" the company said.  Loading the cards  CoinJar has published complete details of Swipe conditions on its blog. Users top up their debit card accounts from their CoinJar account dashboards by selecting the required balance in AUD, and then the exchange handles conversion from BTC.  There are two options for loading: manual or automatic. Manual loading enables users to choose a time and thus exchange rate most favorable to them.  With the automatic loading option, which aims for convenience, users set a minimum balance (in dollars) for the debit card account that, when reached, will trigger an automatic trade for a pre-set amount (also in AUD).  Automatic loading provides a 'live feel' to the spending process, despite direct bitcoin-to-debit card spending in stores not yet being an option.  Adoption in daily life  CoinJar representative Samual Tate told CoinDesk the company was ""making a point"" rather than profit with its debit card infrastructure.  Bitcoin debit cards also aren't just about bolting bitcoin features onto existing financial and banking systems, he added.  ""We want to show that bitcoin can not only fit into legacy systems, but actually make them more efficient.""  Consumers outside the bitcoin universe would ""follow the path of least resistance"" when choosing to adopt new systems, Tate continued. It would be a matter of who could make the transition to bitcoin-based savings and spending easiest.  Tech-savvy testers  CoinJar operates what it calls a 'DNA program', where customers identified as power users are granted beta-testing access to new features. The company says it is planning to launch ""a suite of new features"" for testers and that it has about 40 customers participating in the program at present.  CoinJar is seeking to build a demographic mixture of user-testers who also have a strong understanding of bitcoin and technology in general.  Users can apply to be part of the program on CoinJar's dedicated web page.
