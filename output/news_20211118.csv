Marathon is not worried about the past week&apos;s dip. During a Bloomberg QuickTake Stock interview, Fred Thiel, Las Vegas-based company&apos;s chief executive officer of Marathon, expressed assurance for Bitcoin&apos;s future and stated that Bitcoin mining is &apos;obviously a very profitable business&apos; and the company can &apos;ride this market for quite a long time.&apos; Thiel expressed that, factoring operational mining costs (energy plus hosting), Bitcoin&apos;s breakeven rate is roughly $6,500, meaning that the digital coin would need to drop at least 80% for Marathon to face challenging difficulties, so the price of Bitcoin plunging under $60,000 still translates into profits for them. What&apos;s not in that cost, if you would, is the depreciation in the miners that we buy. We depreciate our miners over five years, so the payback on that is less than a year at today&apos;s margins. (…) We are a very small team from an operational overhead perspective, so that gets covered very quickly. Thiel stated those costs are a very comfortable place for the company to be at and believes that Marathon is &apos;one of the most efficient miners in the industry today&apos; because of their agile model that focused on investing in R...",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/why-marathon-is-comfortable-with-bitcoin-plunging-says-bep-is-6500/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

42396485,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT3qTc,1637278200,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Drops Below $60K Amid Broad Sell-Off in Crypto Markets,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Crypto markets are looking weaker as bitcoin falls below $60,000 and ether loses its foothold over $4,000.  Technician’s Take: Buyers could defend immediate support around $56,000 into Asian trading hours, albeit briefly given strong overhead resistance on the charts.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $56,630 -5.5%  Ether (ETH): $3,964 -6.3%  Market moves  Bitcoin (BTC) was headed for its worst weekly performance since May as the price of the largest cryptocurrency by market value slid below $60,000.  The price was around $58,000 at press time, down 11.5% since Sunday night, and came amid a broad sell-off in cryptocurrency markets. Ether (ETH) fell below $4,000 for the first time since late October.  Traders were hard-pressed to come up with specific reasons for the latest declines but acknowledged the market is suddenly looking weaker than it was last week when the bitcoin price surged to an all-time high near $69,000.  “The bears will be growing in confidence,” Matt Blom, head of sales and trading for the digital-asset firm Eqonex, wrote Thursday in a newsletter. “Their continual probing of lower levels has so far failed to prove successful, but one close below $58,850 will increase their confidence and prices will move down to $56,670.”  Potential catalysts ahead: U.S. President Joe Biden has said he plans to name his nominee for Federal Reserve chair in the next couple days, and analysts are evaluating which of the two presumed frontrunners – current Chair Jerome Powell or Fed Governor Lael Brainard – might be better for the crypto industry. Factors to evaluate include their stance on how to fight fast-rising inflation and how quickly the U.S. central bank might push to roll out a digital version of the dollar.  There’s also a Sotheby’s auction scheduled for Thursday evening (U.S. time) where a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) has raised $27 million to bid on one of the last original copies of the U.S. Constitution still in private hands. The event is sure to generate yuks and maybe gasps, if no noticeable change in trader sentiment.  The tone in crypto markets on Thursday contrasted starkly with the optimism seen in traditional markets, where the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of large U.S. stocks rose to a new record. Tech stocks drove the gains, even as concerns grew among economists that inflation, now running at its highest clip in three decades, might force the Federal Reserve to accelerate interest-rate increases next year to keep the economy from running too hot.  Such monetary tightening might also be a negative for bitcoin because Fed rate increases theoretically would make risky assets – from stocks to cryptocurrencies – less attractive.  Technician’s take  Bitcoin Tumbled to 3-Week Low Under $60K; Next Support at $53K  Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $60,000 as sellers remained active over the past few hours, pushing the price to its lowest in three weeks.  Bitcoin’s price retreat came amid a broad sell-off in cryptocurrency markets, with the CoinDesk 20-listed digital assets trading in the red. BTC’s upside momentum continues to slow on the daily price chart, suggesting continued profit-taking among buyers. And the relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is not yet oversold, which provides scope for further downside in BTC over the short-term.  The 100-day moving average, currently around $53,000, could attract buyers similar to late September, which preceded a price recovery.  For now, intraday charts appear deeply oversold. This means buyers could defend immediate support around $56,000, albeit briefly given strong overhead resistance on the charts.

42396487,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT3qUb,1637270010,Market Wrap: Cryptocurrencies Slide as Buyers Stick to the Sidelines,"Cryptocurrencies continued to slide as buyers appear to be taking some profits. Some analysts are now cautious on bitcoin’s short-term price direction given the recent loss of upside momentum.  Bitcoin declined toward a three-week low on Thursday around $56,000 before stabilizing near $58,000. BTC is down about 11% over the past week, compared with a 14% drop in ether over the same period.  “Downward momentum is hardly a good sign; pay attention to the cautious approach of bulls, which are not in a hurry to buy and waiting for more precise [entry] signals,” Alex Kuptsikevich, an analyst at FxPro, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  Latest prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $58,251, -3.63%  Ether (ETH): $4,084, -4.13%  S&P 500: $4,704, +0.34%  Gold: $1,860, -0.36%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.58%  Other analysts pointed to regulatory developments as a possible reason for the crypto pullback.  “Central bank officials say changing trends and developments on the regulatory and monetary side could also halt the gains for digital assets,” Freddie Evans, a trader at the U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  On Thursday, U.S. lawmakers introduced a bill to amend the crypto-related provisions in the bipartisan infrastructure bill signed into law earlier this week, CoinDesk’s Nikhilesh De reported. The proposed amendments could clarify certain tax rules for crypto-related companies.  Muted bitcoin trading volume  Bitcoin’s trading volume declined over the past few days across major exchanges. Lower volume is typical when BTC trades in a tight range, between $57,000 and $65,000 over the past week.  Still, the seven-day moving average of spot BTC trading volume is slightly higher, suggesting that trading activity could eventually begin an upward trend.  “During the bull run this autumn, we haven’t seen the same big spikes in spot volumes as we did during the bullish breakout in the spring,” Arcane Research wrote in a report earlier this week.  Ether testing support  Ether, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is testing initial support near $4,000. Similar to BTC, upside momentum has slowed over the past week after buyers failed to sustain an all-time price high around $4,800.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is not yet oversold, although further downside in ETH appears to be limited toward $3,600.  Click here for technical analysis on bitcoin.  Altcoin roundup  Gaming tokens rally: SAND, the native cryptocurrency of metaverse platform The Sandbox, has rallied 85% since Tuesday to a new record high above $4.20. Earlier this week, the platform announced its highly anticipated play-to-earn metaverse event. Other gaming tokens including DVI and YGG have also rallied, reported CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole.  Maple Finance launches first DeFi syndicated loan: Maple, which specializes in liquidity pools made up of institutions, has launched its first syndicated loan for Alameda Research, the trading firm affiliated with global cryptocurrency exchange FTX.

42411628,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glPLLI,1637268501,Public Banking vs. Open-Source Money: What Omarova for OCC Means,"Brian Quintenz, former commodities regulator and friend to the crypto industry, weighed in today on the confirmation process to elect a new Comptroller of the Currency. Taking the stand today in a U.S. Senate hearing is Saule Omarova, a controversial pick for the seat due to her professed support for public banking and skepticism of some corners of private finance.  Over her brief academic career, Omarova published papers making the case for strengthening the Federal Reserve’s role in consumer banking, limiting the ability for private banks to feed into speculative frenzies (a la the 2008 derivatives crisis) and reining in the excesses of the fintech and crypto sectors.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  For this, she’s been called a “radical choice” by U.S. senators, talking heads and crypto thinkboys. (Some of this criticism is tinted xenophobic red; conspiracists like to point that Omarova won a Lenin Personal Academic Scholarship while studying philosophy at Moscow State University in 1989.)  “I think that anyone needs to be expected to answer for their record, to the extent that they have a record and to the extent that they put themselves out there publicly, espousing certain beliefs or discussing certain frameworks,” Quintenz said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover.”  Although some of her views fall well outside of mainstream opinion, Omarova does represent an increasingly common view among regulators that crypto needs to be brought under their yoke. A progressive, self-described lover of American capitalism, Omarova supports both a “digital dollar” central bank digital currency and publicly run banks. Crypto, it’s said, is a distraction.  In a recent interview, Omarova told New York magazine that her tough regulatory positions are meant to actually strengthen the banking sector, which “many Americans lost confidence in” following the 2008 financial crisis. These frustrations paved the way for innovators like fintech and crypto to step in.  “They should welcome reasonable, rational, good regulation because it actually helps all of them to do good and not be outcompeted by the bad guys,” she said. [emphasis added] “They should welcome a strong regulator who understands the industry and who can be a strong protector for the banking sector as well.”  The OCC, by its own estimates, oversees about 1,000 banks and institutions worth almost $15 trillion. This includes the three crypto firms granted national charters after former acting head Brian Brooks paved the way for that last year.  There are some concerns that a new crypto-skeptic OCC lead could overturn some of the positive advances Brooks made while in office. Last month Brooks told CoinDesk he thinks his legacy is secure – for instance, calling his stablecoin guidance “super-tightly lawyered.”  “Once people – especially in independent agencies – are confirmed to lead them, they have a lot of power to make decisions, using a lot of flexibility in the law, and can do so in a way that doesn’t necessarily provide a lot of accountability to Congress or the American people,” Quintenz said.  Read more: ‘Wrong’ to Regulate Crypto Through Enforcement: Ex-CFTC Official Quintenz  For her part, Omarova has noted that there’s a difference between exploring ideas in an academic setting and enacting them while leading a federal body. And even if it is doubtful that crypto and fintech could “revolutionize” finance, as she said in 2019, she does support the industry’s key values of privacy and data security. Not to mention her overall concern in improving financial access and curbing the predatory nature of banks.  Raúl Carrillo, an associate research scholar at Yale Law School, went as far as saying in a CoinDesk op-ed that Omarova could emerge as an unlikely ally to the crypto industry.  Either way, Omarova faces a tough road ahead: If even one Democrat decides to vote against her she’ll lose her nomination.

42396472,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT3qEr,1637268145,Polkadot Chief Promises Freedom From Ethereum’s ‘Economic Enslavement’,"The completion of the first Polkadot parachain auction was occasion for its creator, Gavin Wood, to herald a newfound freedom from the economic constraints of Ethereum smart contracts.  Wood, a co-founder of Ethereum who helped develop the smart contract programming language Solidity, said Polkadot’s economic lease-holding model for parachains (literally, parallelized chains) is exactly why users don’t need to buy a platform token, or need to know anything about the framework’s overarching native token, DOT.  It’s a model that stands in stark contrast to Ethereum and most of Ethereum’s competitors, according to Wood.  “The users of applications that are built on Ethereum are enslaved to it in an economic sense,” said Wood in an interview with CoinDesk. “These users have to own ether on Ethereum and oftentimes some other token that allows them to use whatever application that is built using Ethereum smart contracts. This is a huge limitation.”  Imagine, said Wood, if every time you did a Google search you had to pay Google a tenth of a cent for electricity.  “That just doesn’t make any sense,” he said. “This is the key difference between the application model of free execution with Polkadot versus the smart contract model of transactive execution that you get with Ethereum and Ethereum’s competitors.”  Polkadot’s approach  From a high level, the Polkadot framework allows application developers to build their own blockchains with their own rules, and for those chains to be able to communicate with one another.  The interlinked blockchain system benefits from the pooled security guarantees of the Relay Chain, which connects the various parachains and serves an important role in validating Polkadot’s randomized proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.  Bitcoin mind warp  Rather provocatively, Wood said Ethereum is actually closer to Bitcoin than many of its adherents would freely admit.  “It’s really Bitcoin, but with some extra scripting,” he said. “It’s up to the Ethereum miners which transactions they include, in exactly the same way as Bitcoin miners can choose to include this Bitcoin transaction rather than that Bitcoin transaction.”  The vagaries of Ethereum miners are part of a more fundamental problem with a blockchain implementation that was not designed to accommodate actions or tasks at the application level. Everything happens at the user level in smart contracts, said Wood.  Parachain race  Polkadot’s first closely fought auction saw the two leading projects, Moonbeam and Acala, collect over $1.3 billion worth of DOT each in a bid to snag the first parachain slot. Taking this into account, it’s been said Polkadot’s expensive competition to secure leasing awards isn’t an open system in the same way that Ethereum is.  Wood pointed out the economic model of parachain auctions still allows for “parathreads,” a pay-as-you-go approach that’s somewhere between a parachain model and the smart contract model where users pay. But with an important difference. On Polkadot it’s still the blockchain paying the system, he said, so that blockchain’s users don’t have to hold the token and don’t have to pay for the application.  “You get much more freedom as an application provider,” said Wood, “both the economic freedom to not pass on this exposure to DOT tokens the way Ethereum requires you to do, and technical freedom to allow you to actually use the full gamut of blockchains capabilities.”  Read more: Acala Wins First Polkadot Parachain Auction, With $1.3B in DOT Committed  Looking ahead  The winners of the first batch of auctions will go live together in mid-December, with many more to follow. Looking ahead, Wood pointed to some technology areas he is interested to see being worked into the Polkadot universe.  This included asynchronous smart contract platforms focused on future levels of composability between blockchains and blockchain shards, which he called “smart contracts 2.0.” Other interesting areas being tackled using Substrate were trusted execution using Intel SGX type of environments, and zero-knowledge proofs tech, both for shielding and privacy, as well as throughput efficiency via rollups.  He also mentioned more “crazy stuff,” such as common-good parachains with non-profit motives.  “I do my best to build something very abstract and general, so it can be used for things beyond what I can see,” said Wood. “There’s definitely a feeling of accomplishment when you see what you’ve built being used for something you didn’t envisage.”",POSITIVE,DOT,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | DOT | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/11/18/polkadot-chief-promises-freedom-from-ethereums-economic-enslavement,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e05b5c9f1d5968d8cdc4b1d81b171eec5ee27467-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The seizures included $1 billion in crypto tied to the darknet market Silk Road. That action is the largest crypto seizure ever by the U.S. government.  In an introductory note, CI Chief Jim Lee also highlighted the “first-ever sentencing of a bitcoin case with a tax component.” In November 2020, a former Microsoft software engineer received a nine-year sentence for a scheme using bitcoin and digital gift cards to defraud the company of $10 million.

42411148,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gj7kez,1637263738,What Hic et Nunc’s Resurrection Says About Decentralized Infrastructure,"Late last week, an NFT (non-fungible token) marketplace called Hic et Nunc suddenly went down without explanation. All URLs tied to hicetnunc.xyz were broken. The site’s Twitter bio displayed an impassive epitaph: “discontinued.”  The community panicked. “Pathetic,” wrote one user in the Hic et Nunc Discord server. “NFTs are dead,” wrote another. The fear was that without a working website, the NFTs themselves were effectively inaccessible.  “What was clear from what happened on Thursday into Friday is that most people did not understand how NFTs work,” said Bernadine Bröcker Wieder, founder of an art-oriented tech company called Vastari. “By having the front-end go down, they thought that meant that they had lost everything.”  Read more: 15 NFT Use Cases That Could Go Mainstream  The reality wasn’t quite so clear-cut. The website for Hic et Nunc was gone, but because most of the data was already sitting on the blockchain (a network called Tezos, in this case), and the code was available on GitHub (an open source repository), the raw data was still accessible – albeit in a somewhat scrambled form.  The incident inadvertently served as a stress test for decentralized infrastructure. NFTs on Hic et Nunc could be salvaged – but the effort would have to come from the community.  “Decentralization” is the buzzword most commonly associated with Web 3.0, but it’s easy to forget what it means, exactly. In theory, so-called “decentralized” infrastructure nods to the structure of the blockchain itself – each miner stores a complete, independent copy of the ledger, so the data isn’t “centralized” in the hands of a single owner. It’s the opposite of how we’re used to understanding data on the internet. If Amazon decided to pull the plug on its cloud computing network right now, a third of the internet would be irretrievable. A truly decentralized website would only ever pull data from the blockchain; if it went down, the raw data would still be salvageable.  In practice, though, “decentralized” has mostly become a shorthand for “crypto-related” – a way to court investors with the veneer of a sturdier system, without fully committing to the idea. This is especially apparent when it comes to NFTs, which are essentially just pieces of data that point to media files. If the image file for your NFT is hosted on a company’s server, and the company goes down, there’s no guarantee you’ll ever see it again. You’ll still “own” the NFT (i.e. the string of letters and numbers that says it belongs to you), but the image itself could disappear.  Hic et Nunc was the brainchild of a single developer, Rafael Lima, who built it from scratch on the Tezos blockchain. He was, in effect, a central authority. But in the days following his decision to abandon the project (it appears to be the result of internal arguments with other members of the Discord server), a VC-backed crypto company called DNS decided to create a mirror site with a new top-level domain. Instead of “.xyz,” it went with “.art.” Last Sunday, it handed control of the new domain to a community member, Joseph Magly. Also known as Manitcor, he’s a developer who helped Lima maintain the original site.  The new site looks nearly identical to the old one, and uses the same underlying smart contracts, so creators can still mint and trade new Hic et Nunc NFTs. The images attached to existing NFTs are still available, too, since media files were housed in a storage system called IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), which transposes data directly onto the blockchain.  “Because [Lima] uses IPFS with the original files, there’s no strange URLs that go in between it. So by Hic et Nunc being down, it doesn’t affect anything with the NFTs,” explained Bröcker Wieder.  This is why crypto purists, ever distrustful of central authorities, like keeping everything “on-chain.” Many of today’s most popular NFT marketplaces don’t operate like this, preferring to run files through centralized intermediaries (either to save money or to keep things simpler from an engineering standpoint). Nifty Gateway, the Winklevoss-owned marketplace that served as a launchpad for the NFT artist Beeple, is a “centralized” platform in that the files themselves don’t live on the blockchain. If the Winklevoss twins decided to take down their servers, NFT holders would have a hard time digging up their images.  This is not to say that this new version of Hic et Nunc is perfect, and that decentralization is always the answer – it’s not. The Discord (and a spin-off server) remains chaotic; no one is quite sure who should take charge of the new site (though some are suggesting it be operated collectively by a DAO). NFTs remain far from a bulletproof claim to ownership, in that they confer no legal rights, and can go missing. But these haven’t, at least so far: They’re just under the care of a new steward.  Violeta López, an artist and developer who worked on the original Hic et Nunc platform, has expressed frustration with the way hicetnunc.art has developed.  “What started off as an open source project has ended up in closed sourced copies,” she said in a statement. “Why couldn’t … third-party developers fork/clone the repository and make its own version of the site instead of hosting third-party tools on their own websites?”  This is sort of true: DNS made the code for the Hic et Nunc mirror site open source, but any new features and improvements to the site are essentially in the hands of a new central actor – Manitcor. At this point, it’s unclear whether the new Hic et Nunc will share the scrappy ethos of the original.  “I basically control everything but the core contracts, which means Rafa is still collecting fees,” Manitcor explained over DM. “At the moment we are waiting to see if the community will organize or if Rafa would like his project back. One or both could happen.”  It’s a fact of the internet that websites come and go. Things get deprecated, and “link rot” sets in. But it’s worth considering what decentralized data structures could do for some of the sites that have been lost to time.  Earlier this week, the website for a beloved blog called The Awl, which has been defunct for several years, disappeared from the internet. As with Hic et Nunc, all links suddenly ceased to work. “Every recurring payment someday stops recurring,” tweeted Choire Sicha, one of the site’s co-founders.  The Awl may return, if all it takes is another monthly payment to a cloud storage company. But if the site’s posts had been decentralized, users wouldn’t have to wait – they could just replicate the site with their own front-end. The crypto-backed blogging platform Mirror already does something like this, storing users’ data on an IPFS alternative called Arweave.  Of course, anyone could clone the site. But would the new Awl be the “real” Awl, or just a sort of “Awl Prime” under new auspices? What if G/O Media, or some other enterprise whose values aren’t necessarily aligned with those of the core readership, decided to swoop in and build a new front-end?  Decentralized infrastructure may allow for cloned websites – data on a blockchain, as opposed to a privately-owned server – but it doesn’t answer the question of control.

42396482,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT3qQf,1637262040,US Congressmen Introduce Bill to Modify Crypto Tax Provision in Infrastructure Law,"A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers have introduced a bill to amend the crypto-related provisions in the bipartisan infrastructure bill signed into law earlier this week.  The “Keep Innovation in America Act,” introduced Thursday, would amend the definition of a crypto broker included in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the bipartisan infrastructure bill passed by both the House of Representatives and Senate earlier this year before being signed into law by U.S. President Joe Biden. The bill also seeks to modify a provision of the new law that amends section 6050I in the tax code, as well as address transactions between brokers and non-brokers.  Representatives Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), Kevin Brady (R-Texas), Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), Warren Davidson (R-Ohio), Anthony Gonzalez (R-Ohio) and Ted Budd (R-N.C.) introduced the bill.  McHenry, the ranking member on the House Financial Services Committee, said the bill would “provide additional clarity” on the scope of the infrastructure bill in a statement.  “On the one hand, we have the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that President Biden signed into law on Monday. It includes digital asset reporting requirements that threaten to push innovators and entrepreneurs overseas,” he said. “This would leave the U.S. as a passive observer of a rapidly evolving industry. On the other hand, we can fix these poorly constructed standards and ensure they are compatible with how this new technology actually works.”  The infrastructure law, first introduced by Senators Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), among others, contains a provision that seeks to expand the definition of a broker for crypto tax reporting purposes. The provision drew the ire of the crypto industry amid concerns that the definition could include wallet manufacturers or software developers who would be unable to comply with the tax reporting requirements. The provision could raise nearly $30 billion in tax revenue over the next decade.  Another provision, which amends Section 6050I, would require recipients of transactions to maintain know-your-customer information from the senders.  The bill introduced Thursday would modify both of these provisions. Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who both advocated for narrowing the scope of the broker definition while the Senate was evaluating the original infrastructure bill in August, introduced their own bill to exempt blockchain validators and non-custodial product vendors from the law on Monday.  On Wednesday, Lummis also tweeted a photo of what appears to be a Senate version of the “Keep Innovation in America Act.”  “We have to figure out how to balance consumer protections and reasonable oversight while simultaneously providing these technologies and companies with the necessary space they need to grow, innovate and democratize the financial sector,” Ryan said in a statement.

The largest cryptocurrency by market value was down 4.2% over the past 24 hours to around $57,800 as of 17:53 UTC (12:53 p.m. ET) on Thursday, after failing to sustain an all-time high around $69,000 last week.  If further declines materialized, the next level of price support is seen around $53,000, which could then stabilize the pullback, based on a CoinDesk analysis.  Bitcoin’s price retreat came amid a broad sell-off in cryptocurrency markets, with the CoinDesk 20-listed digital assets trading in the red.

And the relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is not yet oversold, which provides scope for further downside in BTC over the short-term.  The 100-day moving average, currently around $53,000, could attract buyers similar to late September, which preceded a price recovery.  For now, intraday charts appear deeply oversold.

CoinDesk previously reported that SDX would go live this month, following the receipt of two licenses from Swiss markets regulator FINMA in September. The SDX blockchain bond is the first digital issuance to be done using regulated market infrastructure, according to a press release from parent company SIX.  Credit Suisse, UBS Investment Bank and Zürcher Kantonalbank acted as the joint lead managers on the bond issuance.  “The first issue of a tokenized bond on the SIX Digital Exchange as well as its listing and placement in the market proves that the forward-looking distributed ledger technology (DLT) also works very well in the highly regulated capital market,” said Thomas Zeeb, global head of markets at SIX, in a statement.  In August, SDX announced that David Newns from State Street would take over as CEO after Tim Grant, formerly of R3 Innovation Lab, left the exchange to join Galaxy Digital. The SDX project was originally led by Martin Halblaub, who quit in 2019 over strategic differences.  SDX is built using the permissioned Corda architecture supplied by R3, and operates as an integrated trading, settlement and custody infrastructure for digital assets.  “This is one of the biggest changes we are likely to see in financial market infrastructure in our lifetime,” said Todd McDonald, R3′s co-founder, in a statement. “In fact, if ever there was a David & Goliath moment in the history of capital markets and financial market infrastructure, it’s the birth of Six Digital Exchange.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/18/switzerlands-six-digital-exchange-launches-with-blockchain-bond,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/205ab876b694f5ed8e0e3a96b53e1bce8fe133d7-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Isreali news publication Haaretz reported that Hogeg was arrested along with seven other individuals, including Hogeg’s former and current partners or employees.  A statement published on the official Twitter page of the Israeli police on Thursday said in Hebrew that “eight suspects were arrested on suspicion of committing fraudulent offenses in the field of cryptocurrencies, amounting to hundreds of millions of shekels,” although it did not name any of the suspects.  According to Haaretz, the eight suspects, which include Hogeg, are accused of a number of offenses including conspiring to mislead investors, theft and money laundering. The Jerusalem Post said he was arrested, along with a family member, at the office of the Premier League football club he owned, Beitar Jerusalem.  A post on Hogeg’s official Facebook page said he had to postpone an event about non-fungible tokens (NFT) that was scheduled for Thursday. A previous post by him says around 1,300 people had registered to attend the event.  Financial fraud allegations against Hogeg have been mounting for years. A 2019 report by CoinDesk took a closer look at a number of lawsuits against Hogeg, who was behind failed initial coin offerings (ICO) including Stox and Leadcoin.  A former employee at one of Hogeg’s businesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told CoinDesk that “we all heard rumors” about Hogeg but few interacted with him directly.  “Every payday, when the money would actually show up in my bank account was a huge relief and when the company inevitably collapsed, none of us were surprised,” the former employee said.  In 2020, Hogeg was sued for $6 million over unpaid Sirin Labs bills. Earlier this year, two of Hogeg’s childhood friends and former employees sued him for 18 million new Israeli shekels (around US$5.8 million) for money owed over failed investments. In September, according to Times of Israel, Hogeg suddenly decided to put up Beitar Jerusalem for sale citing “racist fans” after he failed to sell half the team to an Arab investor.  A document circulating around the internet and reviewed by CoinDesk lays out 15 offenses against Hogeg including conspiracy to commit crime, falsifying corporate documentation, as well as a number of offenses related to sexual assault. In early November, an Israeli model accused Hogeg of sexually assaulting her years ago when she was still 17 years old. According to Times of Israel Hogeg denied the allegations, adding that the model’s accusations were part of a smear campaign.  “This morning, dozens of police officers raided the homes and businesses of detainees and a number of detainees, in order to gather evidence and seize exhibits related to the investigation,” Israeli police tweeted.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | TOKEN SALE,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/11/18/crypto-heavyweight-moshe-hogeg-reportedly-arrested-in-israel,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/418c923d56e02bcd95997c2f4f7a862b04b40d73-1500x1500.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396480,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT3qOh,1637255251,Blockchain Association Raises $4M to Grow Its Presence on Capitol Hill,"The Blockchain Association, one of the crypto industry’s largest lobbying groups, raised $4 million in new funding.  Crypto exchange Kraken and Digital Currency Group (CoinDesk’s parent company) both contributed $1 million. Filecoin Foundation contributed $2 million with the promise of an additional $2 million donation later, if the Blockchain Association can raise an equivalent amount through outside funding, the group announced Thursday.  The funding round comes as policymakers in Washington, D.C., are weighing a host of potential regulations for the crypto industry, including possible modifications to crypto-focused provisions in the recently passed bipartisan infrastructure bill.  Kristin Smith, the executive director of the Blockchain Association, told CoinDesk the funds would serve to “turbocharge” the organization by giving it the financial flexibility needed to hire additional staff, host more events and function at the same level as lobbying groups for other industries.  Smith said the infrastructure law, which has been hotly debated in the crypto sphere for its inclusion of two provisions that could reshape the industry, was a major catalyst for the donations, along with the ongoing bull market.  “Given that it has been such a wild ride this past year, and that the industry is just exploding, we think that now is the time to mature the lobbying effort in Washington,” Smith said. “We want to grow the Blockchain Association to the level we need to be so that we can go from being reactive to government action to actually proactively moving policies forward.”  The Blockchain Association was founded in 2018 with an operating budget of less than $2 million. Smith told CoinDesk the new injection of funds has allowed the group to hire senior executives for the first time – on Nov. 9, the organization announced that it had added crypto lawyer Jake Chervinsky as its head of policy and Dave Grimaldi as its head of government relations.  Aside from building out its team, Smith said the funding will allow the Blockchain Association to keep working on several key policy issues, including modifying the tax provision in the infrastructure bill, keeping up with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler’s approach to securities laws and shaping policies on stablecoins and anti-money laundering (AML).  Smith also stressed the importance of ongoing crypto education on Capitol Hill.  “Unlike other issues I’ve worked on in my lobbying career, you can’t just have one meeting and they get it,” Smith told CoinDesk. “It’s a series of conversations we have to have over and over.”  “It needs to be a sustained campaign. You can’t just write a white paper, fly into town, talk with a couple members and fly out. It’s having a constant presence and letting people know that we can be a resource to them,” she said.  Despite the coming battle over the crypto provisions in the infrastructure law and the immense amount of work that lays ahead of the Blockchain Association, Smith believes the group is well positioned to make change on Capitol Hill.  “I’ve never been more optimistic about our chances for success in Washington,” Smith said.  “I feel like we’re finally getting the pieces on the chessboard that we need to win, and I’m really excited about it.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIL | REGULATION | TRADING,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/11/18/blockchain-association-raises-4m-to-grow-its-presence-on-capitol-hill,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e876f4c583af86dc4c84a3de3ea2081a58823cc5-4000x2667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The winner was decided by the candle auction process, which randomly selected a block from the past seven days, at which point Acala was in the lead.  It was hard to keep track of how many times the two projects swapped the first place position during the process, which saw the first 10 hopeful projects collect almost $3.5 billion in crowdloaned DOT.  When contributions to the auction ended, Thursday at noon European time, Moonbeam had gathered the most from its community, over $1.36 billion. However, Acala was in the lead for 63% of the time, giving it the best chance of securing the slot, even though it only took in $1.30 billion. Acala raised its funds from 81,000 wallets.  The high drama (and high volume of traffic) further validates the candle auction process, a type of sale designed to prevent last-minute auction sniping, said Polkadot creator Gavin Wood.  “There’s real competition and this is really what we want with the auction,” Wood told CoinDesk in an interview. “It’s something that wouldn’t really have happened in a traditional auction, where they would have kept very low, all the way until the end, and then they would have put everything that they had in as late as possible.”  Wood pointed out that while there is a “glamor factor” about being the first-ever auction winner, on a technical level, it makes no difference since all the parachains are going to be activated at the same time.  This opening batch of five Polkadot parachains will be auctioned off by mid-December and then all the projects will go live simultaneously on Dec. 17. This is notably different from Polkadot’s “canary network” Kusama’s parachain auctions earlier this year. In that case, the first parachain was won by Acala’s sister project Kurara, which meant that project could go live first.  The auction revealed some interesting data insights. For instance, one participant is responsible for around 40% of all Polkadot contributions, according to Polkadot data indexing service SubQuery. Project leads say major exchanges participating in the crowdloan process appear to have grouped individual users into a central wallet, perhaps accounting for the large contributors.

The Outlier Ventures’ accelerator was launched in 2019 and has been dubbed the “Y-Combinator” of the metaverse, raising over $250 million in seed funding so far for its portfolio of 100 projects.  Projects funded by the firm include those involved in decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFT) and blockchain infrastructure, as well as NFT-based digital couture fashion brands, avatar marketplaces, play-to-earn games and augmented reality pets.  The accelerator’s newest strategic members also include Sandbox co-founder Sebastien Borget and Polygon Network founder Sandeep Nailwal.  “The metaverse will eventually connect every platform, virtual world and game into a single permissionless peer-to-peer economy native to the internet, most importantly underpinned by crypto and Web 3 technology,” said Outlier Ventures CEO Jamie Burke in a statement.  The metaverse is a space generated by the convergence of virtual worlds, augmented reality and internet services. By offering a collective virtual experience, it has introduced new opportunities to creators, gamers and artists.  Facebook recently changed its corporate name to Meta and announced its metaverse will support NFTs.  “In the same way that crypto is increasingly experienced through immersive experiences that bridge the real world with virtual assets, the metaverse makes our physical and digital spaces indistinguishable,” noted Burke.

Cypher, the upstart protocol, plans to start trading synthetic futures contracts tied to restricted assets like pre-public stocks or upcoming token sales as soon as next month, project developers told CoinDesk.  It raised $2.1 million from crypto venture firms Sino Global, SkyVision and Blockwall. That amounts to 6% of Cypher’s total governance token issuance, project contributors told CoinDesk.  Cypher’s goal is to become an influential outpost for price discovery. Letting investors trade contracts that capture what they believe a soon-to-launch token is worth can help that token’s project better set launch price, they said. They’re already in talks with some protocols.  Beyond just tokens and stocks, “we’re looking at things like NFT futures, DeFi rate derivatives – so a lot of stuff where having that set expiration date can really help you express a more nuanced view on the market,” James, a project contributor and globetrotting expat, said.  Having an expiration date on futures contracts is commonplace in traditional finance (TradFi), but not so in crypto. Degens have favored perpetuals ever since BitMEX introduced the form in 2016; it remains a product seldom found off-chain. That makes Cypher’s vision somewhat of an outlier in DeFi.  But James argued Cypher’s product is “easier” for DeFi newcomers to understand. Plus, he said it fits better with the needs of pre-launch markets. A futures contract on Kraken’s eventual IPO price would expire after the first day of trading concludes. Pyth will supply Cypher’s price feeds.  The developers said they’ve taken steps to avoid getting caught in the legal morass that Mirror, another synthetic futures market in DeFi, faces.

42396471,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT3qDs,1637244042,Maple Finance Launches First DeFi Syndicated Loan for Alameda Research,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) has started eating up syndicated loans.  Maple Finance, a lending platform that specializes in liquidity pools made up of institutions, announced on Thursday that it launched its first decentralized finance (DeFi) syndicated loan for Alameda Research, the trading firm affiliated with global cryptocurrency exchange FTX.  In the traditional world, a syndicated loan is financing offered by a group of lenders, usually banks, to borrowers that could be corporations, large infrastructure projects or governments. These loans tend to be denominated in the billions and are spread out among several lenders to mitigate the risk in case the borrower defaults.  In this instance, a whitelisted cohort of lenders including CoinShares, Abra and Ascendex have committed $25 million in capital at launch, with planned growth to $1 billion over 12 months, a press release said.  Read more: Maple Finance Launches Permissioned Institutional Lending Pool With BlockTower, Genesis  Maple describes itself as “an institutional capital marketplace built on the Ethereum blockchain,” which means providing infrastructure to help companies borrow money and expand, said Maple Finance CEO Sid Powell.  “What’s really important about it is that it provides firms with a way of directly accessing capital markets and institutional investors so that they can raise debt for themselves,” Powell told CoinDesk in an interview. “This is completely different to the way things have been done before. In a way, you could think of it as a kind of on-chain crypto SPAC [special purpose acquisition vehicle].”  There are two other unnamed institutional investors involved in the DeFi syndicated loan, which is restricted to accredited non-U.S. institutions, with all having been through anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) processing. Powell said the loans are paying fixed rates in the 8% to 10% range.  Maple Finance recently launched a permissioned institutional lending pool with BlockTower and Genesis (owned by CoinDesk’s parent company, Digital Currency Group). Unlike “traditional DeFi,” which relies on collateral that can be slashed in the event of underpayment, Maple allows users to issue uncollateralized or under collateralized loans to known entities based on reputation.  Read more: Maple Finance Raises $1.4M for Its Reputation-Based DeFi Lending Platform  Powell sought to clarify what’s meant by “reputation” in this case.  “What’s happening here is that Alameda and the other borrowers are providing their financials – profitability, balance sheet strength – very similar to the underwriting that a bank would do if they decided to lend a large company money,” he said. “It’s different to what’s been done in DeFi, which needs to evolve. The fact is that no institution wants to put down $150 to borrow $100.”  DeFi is also eating enterprise blockchain’s lunch. Syndicated loans involving a heavyweight paper trail and numerous middlemen were touted as a promising use case for permissioned chains a few years ago.  “I think enterprises spent too long deciding how they were going to build the internet themselves, instead of building what they wanted to use on the internet,” said Powell. “We accepted that the internet of money for now is on Ethereum, and didn’t waste a lot of time trying to rebuild that. Instead, we just built purposeful infrastructure to support companies borrowing.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | SPONSORED | RESEARCH,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/18/maple-finance-launches-first-defi-syndicated-loan-for-alameda-research,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/74ef4d433113d3a7f91ef5a9ec243bcf7fc33437-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Circle will provide the infrastructure to enable these payments as part of the exchange’s Bitso Shift initiative, which is designed to improve upon cross-border payment services currently available. Bitso Shift will enable companies and individuals who offer their products and services in the U.S. to make and receive payments in cryptocurrency.  The U.S. is Mexico’s leading trade partner, according to the World Bank. In 2020, Mexico received $40 billion in remittances from the U.S., according to Mexico’s Central Bank.  By incorporating the payments solutions of Circle, the payment services company that operates the USD coin (USDC) stablecoin, the initiative will allow users to make deposits and withdrawals via domestic wire transfers and execute payments to the U.S. or Mexico. It will also allow users to convert Mexican pesos to U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins.  According to Bitso, access to bank accounts in U.S. dollars is only available for Mexican individuals living in Mexico’s northern border area. That restriction affects self-employed individuals and companies in the rest of the country seeking to open U.S. dollar accounts, the company added.  “We are incredibly excited to partner with Circle to offer a regulated, low-cost product that will support Mexican freelancers and businesses to thrive in the global digital economy,” Bitso co-founder and CEO Daniel Vogel said in a statement.  Circle co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire said he sees a great opportunity for the companies “to be part of making cross-border exchanges seamless between the U.S. and Mexico – the world’s largest exchange corridor.”  Wire transfers to Bitso Shift will take between 24 to 48 hours to process, while in-app exchanges between U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins and Mexican pesos will be processed in seconds, according to Bitso. No minimum transaction volumes or balance amounts are required, the company added.

42411633,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glPLYW,1637243400,Not All Cryptos Are Scarce Like Bitcoin,"Of the ever-growing reasons why bitcoin keeps making national news, its scarcity is one of the most notable.  Touted as an inflation hedge by top advisories such as JPMorgan, bitcoin is earning a renewed reputation as “digital gold” while the U.S. Treasury prints more fiat currency.  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it every Thursday.  “Most, but not all, cryptocurrencies and all NFTs [non-fungible tokens] have scarcity as a key component of their value proposition,” said Michael Terpin, founder and CEO of the blockchain public relations firm Transform Group.  Bitcoin and ethereum  “Bitcoin’s fixed-supply scarcity is most highly valued because it is coupled with accelerating demand, proven use cases and recognized desirability,” Terpin told CoinDesk.  Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million coins. (There are currently between 18 and 19 million bitcoin in circulation.) The remaining amount of bitcoin will reportedly take over 100 years to mint. Combine this kind of scarcity with inflation and the lessening value of our fiat currency (the U.S. dollar) and you have a recipe for value, argues Terpin.  However, all scarcity is not created equally. Ethereum has its own economics of scarcity, including the ability to burn tokens to offset high “gas fees,” or user payments that cover the computing cost to authenticate tokens and coins on the blockchain.  “Ethereum is also known for powering most of the current DeFi [decentralized finance] and NFT ecosystems, giving it a unique competitive edge,” Terpin says. “Few other cryptos can match these dynamics today.”  Meme coins and scarcity  With bitcoin’s 10-plus-year track record behind it, supply and demand economics have helped investors get a little clearer on how to value digital currency. Time is an essential part of the equation, along with the number of coins in circulation.  Community also has a great deal of impact on a coin’s value. Meme coins are the perfect case study for this group buy-in component of crypto. Driven by social media jokes and puns, meme coins tend to flood the crypto ecosystem with new information. This phenomenon can interrupt any notion of predictability or patterns in value.  “Dogecoin has an infinite supply,” said Phillip Gara, director of strategy for the Render Network, a company that uses the Ethereum blockchain to process high-quality digital assets.  There’s also shiba inu, which is having its 15 minutes of fame. A total of 1 quadrillion SHIB tokens were minted during its launch in 2020 – that’s a number with 15 zeros. Roughly half of the SHIB supply was locked in Uniswap, a decentralized exchange where users and investors can trade, and the other 50% was donated to Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum.  There was some speculation that Elon Musk’s shiba inu tweet in early October – in addition to the coin’s total supply – contributed to the hype, but thanks to blockchain’s transparency, the crypto community was able to peg SHIB’s price increase to so-called crypto “whales” who bought and held large amounts of the coin.  NFTs and the value of scarcity  In addition, notes Gara, the digitally scarce blockchain artwork known as NFTs demonstrate perhaps the highest degree of scarcity and therefore the most opportunities to utilize creative pricing strategies.  “[A creator] can create unique, 1-of-1 artworks or editions. You can make open editions where as many people who want one can mint one for the price,” Gara said. “There’s a lot of innovation you can do with pricing.”  An artist or creator can also use a descending-price strategy known as a Dutch auction, according to Gara, when it’s time to drop their tokens. In a Dutch auction, the price of a token is reduced over time to create a kind of “economic equilibrium.”  “The demand gets matched according to peoples’ price sensitivity, so you have more buyers,” Gara says.  The value of NFTs, however, tends to be more subjective (as is the nature of art). While the value of cryptocurrency is also speculative, it leans much more than NFTs on the principles of economics, fiscal policy and supply and demand.  What advisors should understand  Scarcity drives value in the world of crypto, like most markets and economic ecosystems. Crypto evangelists therefore see bitcoin as “digital gold” that, unlike the U.S. dollar, has a finite limit.  The term “digital gold” is enough to make anyone take a closer look at crypto, but just like with investing in any alternative asset, your clients need to understand their “why” behind adding crypto to their portfolio.  If they do plan to use it as an inflation hedge, talk them through cold storage and hosted wallets so that they understand where they plan to store their “gold.” And if they want to liquidate it periodically, have them consider the right frequency (annually, quarterly, monthly?), what the capital gains taxes may be and what they plan to do with the cash.",NEUTRAL,SHIB,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | FIAT | SHIB,Megan DeMatteo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/18/not-all-cryptos-are-scarce-like-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c17817dfd5e37de39057cc5524b8accea54dee84-5333x3333.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42411632,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glPLbp,1637243400,How DAOs Can Empower Advisors and Investors,"Disintermediation and decentralization can sometimes be intimidating concepts for those of us accustomed to the traditional financial system and industry.  For those of us who have learned to navigate the labyrinthine incumbent and entrenched system of banks, brokers, custodians, exchanges and asset managers, our knowledge of traditional finance has often been quite lucrative. Disintermediation and decentralization mean having to learn something new.  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it every Thursday.  But if we peel back the layers of these concepts, we’re likely to find tremendous opportunities for engagement, creating social good and potentially generating returns and income.  What is a DAO, exactly?  That brings us to the concept of a DAO, or a decentralized autonomous organization, a blockchain-based community whose rules and practices are contained in computer code rather than in printed bylaws.  Unlike decentralized finance (DeFi) in general, which uses blockchains to replace trusted third parties in banking, lending, investing and other financial transactions, DAOs use technology to transfer some or all decision-making power from organizations to individuals, utilizing code to set guidelines for how decisions are made and enforced.  Most DAOs are built on the Ethereum blockchain and serve varying roles. Some early entrants into the DAO area were solely built to govern a cryptocurrency. Others were created to extend blockchain technology to other areas of finance and investing, such as the Index Coop DAO, which creates decentralized index products in the cryptocurrency sector.  DAOs and advisors  I recently discussed one such DAO with PlannerDAO founder Steve Larsen, the founder of PlannerDAO, a source of digital assets information and infrastructure for financial advisors, and who helped launch the Certified Digital Assets Advisor (CDAA) designation.  Unlike most advisor designations, such as CFP (Certified Financial Planner), CPWA (Certified Private Wealth Advisors) and CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst), which have centralized governing bodies deciding on qualifications and other rules regarding the use of their marks, the CDAA is governed by a DAO made up of its membership. Advisors who earn their CDAA marks are given a digital token that allows them to participate in the designation’s governance.  “We want the DAO community to decide which areas of cryptocurrencies and the technology are relevant to advisors, and then we want to open it up to other providers to come in and provide education to our professionals,” said Larsen. “So someone like the FPA [Financial Planning Association] could come in as an education provider, but our community of planners would decide on the topics and requirements. The community members and holders of our certification determine what’s relevant.”  For participating in the decentralized governance of the CDAA, advisors will receive another token that is intended to increase in value over time, said Larsen, so “advisors get compensated for the work they’re doing as members of our community – they don’t have to develop a product or service, they’re compensated by the economic structure we’re putting in place to deliver solutions.”  The CDAA’s DAO will provide its membership with tools, checklists and templates to ease the process of working with clients’ digital assets and provide advisors with a safe place to ask questions and have discussions on cryptocurrencies without having to rely on the not-always-objective expertise of asset managers, vendors or custodians. While such industry participants express zeal for educating advisors, they also have conflicts of interest, as they are trying to earn advisors’ business and accumulate assets.  Other DAOs for investors emerge  Popcorn, a soon-to-launch DeFi platform with a socially responsible twist, has also gravitated towards the DAO structure for part of its governance. But while the CDAA is distinctly directed at advisors, Popcorn is aimed at all investors.  Simply put, Popcorn is a yield aggregator that allows some of its returns – up to half of them, in fact – to be directed towards charitable organizations.  Investors deploy their digital assets to Popcorn’s liquidity pools via smart contracts – contracts whose terms are governed by code, with no need for an intermediary ensuring that all parties meet their obligations. In return for their investment, investors receive a token that allows them to participate in the centralized governance of the pool, including the ability to vote to choose which beneficiaries receive the portion of the return that becomes a donation and set parameters for the smart contracts.  “The great thing is that you can just come to Popcorn if you want to use our products to generate yield. You’re not required to participate in the governance,” said Popcorn co-founder Michael Kisselgof. “If you have earned a Popcorn token, you’re incentivized to contribute because we are baking incentives into our model.”  Through Popcorn, advisors’ clients can not only create social good, but they can generate attractive income in an era of low interest rates and shrinking dividends. The company’s first product, Butter, is a stablecoin strategy capable of generating up to 15% in annual yield.  Another DAO, Augur, has been used to power sports betting markets and options. Augur allows any user to make predictions, whether it be on elections, sporting events or the value of a stock on a specific date through its platform.  Takeaways  Decentralization doesn’t mean that advisors and other financial intermediaries will be obsolete. In many cases, DAOs will empower advisors and investors with greater decision-making abilities.  So if DAOs catch on and are applied throughout the wealth management space, there will be less of a need to rely on influential industry organizations and custodians for guidance and governance. Instead, advisors and investors will be empowered to do these things themselves across user-friendly platforms, and will often be compensated and incentivized for their participation in them.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Christopher Robbins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/11/18/how-daos-can-empower-advisors-and-investors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b8c7434c819de518f238f7f0c5f376f14da40e37-3456x2304.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411910,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgxAH,1637242207,How to Buy Shiba Inu Coin (SHIB),"Shiba inu coin (SHIB) is one of the most hotly traded cryptocurrencies. A big part of the underdog’s viral success in the market can be attributed to dogecoin’s explosive price performance and the die-hard following the project created around the Shiba Inu theme.  As the main market competitor and spinoff of dogecoin, shib token has drawn significant speculation from crypto investors who are hoping to ride the next doggy-themed wave and try to make fast returns like many early dogecoin investors enjoyed at the start of the year.  While it shares many similarities with dogecoin, namely its Shiba Inu theme, extremely large supply and very low-cost token, shiba inu coin sets out to provide substantially more utility for its holders than is currently available with doge. For starters, the project launched its own ShibaSwap decentralized exchange where crypto holders can swap SHIB for a range of other listed tokens, much like Uniswap or Balancer. Building on this, shiba inu coin also features two other ERC-20 tokens – known as BONE and LEASH – which provide additional utility including governance and a store of value for holders.  Read More: Investing in Meme Coins? 3 Things Every Crypto Trader Should Know  All three tokens within the shiba inu coin ecosystem can be used to generate interest by either staking or providing liquidity on the ShibaSwap platform, making it an equally hot DeFi token too.  Where and how to buy shiba inu coin  Where to buy shiba inu coin on centralized exchanges  Thanks to the mainstream popularity of meme coins, cryptocurrencies like SHIB are widely available on most leading centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. These include:  Coinbase  Binance  Huobi Global  Gemini  KuCoin  How to buy shiba inu coin (SHIB) on centralized exchanges  The process for signing up and using these exchanges to buy SHIB is relatively straightforward and follows the same steps regardless of which platform you opt for.  As Binance is one of the exchanges where the highest volume of SHIB tokens are traded, we’ll use this platform as an example.  Sign up for an exchange account or sign in if you already have one.  Complete the know-your-customer (KYC) process to be allowed to buy cryptocurrencies if you haven’t already done so. This process usually takes a few minutes to complete. On Binance, this can be found by hovering over the account icon in the top right corner and clicking on “Identification.”  Navigate to the page to buy cryptocurrency – USDT, USDC, DOGE or skip this step if a direct fiat currency pair is available – either through a credit/debit card, bank transfer, cryptocurrency or other option provided by the exchange.  Insert the amount you want to spend on the purchase (either in fiat currency or cryptocurrency)  Select your payment method of choice  Check any disclaimer buttons or boxes there may be and hit confirm. Complete the payment process, and – depending on the payment method and exchange guidelines – the purchased amount should become accessible in your wallet within a few minutes.  If you had to fund your account with fiat currency – such as U.S. dollars (USD) – to purchase shiba inu coin, it may take one to five business days before the funds are credited. Afterward, you still need to swap your balance for SHIB. This process can be completed by going to the “Markets” section of your exchange, finding the SHIB/USD (or SHIB – other currency pair), and using the “Trade” option. On Binance, clicking this button will take you to the exchange interface where you will be guided through the process of placing a trade via the order book system.  Where to buy shiba inu coin on decentralized exchanges  There are two main decentralized exchanges where you can buy shiba inu coins. The first is the ShibaSwap platform – the native decentralized exchange of shiba inu coin. The second is Uniswap, a popular automated Ethereum-based crypto exchange.  How to buy shiba inu coin on ShibaSwap  There are two main decentralized exchanges where you can easily purchase shiba inu coins. The first is the ShibaSwap platform – the native decentralized exchange of shiba inu. In order to use this platform to buy shiba inu coin, you will need to connect your Ethereum-based wallet by clicking the “Connect wallet” option in the top right corner (red arrow). There are three different wallet options available (white arrows):  Metamask  Wallet Connect  Coinbase Wallet  Read More: Your First Crypto Wallet: How to Use It and Why You Need One  Since Metamask is the most commonly used wallet, we’ll use that as an example. If you haven’t already, you’ll need to download Metamask by heading to the official website here and clicking “download now.” The operating system or browser you use will determine which version you download.  Once you’re done, you’ll need to create a password and fund your Metamask wallet with an amount of ether – the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain. The easiest way to do this is by clicking the “buy” button on Metamask. This will take you to a page with several options where you can purchase ether using your debit or credit card.  Once you’ve completed this step, you’re ready to swap ether (ETH) for shiba inu coin (SHIB) on ShibaSwap.  Return to the ShibaSwap website and find the “Swap” tile on the lower left-hand side of the home screen. Clicking will take you to the decentralized swap feature of the platform. Here, you’ll need to select “ETH” in the top box and search for “shiba inu coin” and select it for the second box, as shown below.  You’ll then need to decide how many SHIB tokens you’ll want to swap your ether for. Once you’ve chosen the correct amount, and are happy with the fees, click the “swap” button.  You’ll now have SHIB tokens in your Metamask wallet.  How to buy shiba inu coin on Uniswap  Purchasing SHIB token using Uniswap is virtually identical to buying the token via ShibaSwap; you’ll need to visit the official website here and click the “launch app” button in the top right-hand corner. You’ll then need to connect your wallet in the same fashion.  Uniswap supports a greater range of Ethereum-based wallets than ShibaSwap. In addition to the three mentioned above in the ShibaSwap section, you can also connect:  Fortmatic wallet  Portis wallet  You’ll then need to search for the SHIB token option in the second box, just as before. In this case, you may need to import the token if it isn’t already on the list. When doing this, it’s vitally important you import the right token and not a fake one. Here’s the correct contract address for shiba inu coin, as provided by Coinmarketcap:  0x95ad61b0a150d79219dcf64e1e6cc01f0b64c4ce  Once you’re confident you have imported the correct shiba inu coin, you can decide how much ether you want to swap into SHIB and complete the transaction. Your new tokens will appear in your Metamask wallet after a few minutes.  How to buy shiba inu coin on mobile devices  The requirements for buying shiba inu coin (SHIB) on mobile devices are similar to buying SHIB using a centralized exchange. You will need an account and complete any KYC procedures required before you can undertake any action.  Other steps include:  1) Download the mobile app of the exchange you want to use or visit the mobile-optimized version of a trading platform.  2) Set a password and write down the seed/recovery phrase on paper and do not make a digital copy! In the event you lose your mobile phone or it gets stolen, you’ll need the seed/recovery phrase to move your existing account onto a new smartphone.  Read more: 4 Ways to Stay Safe in Crypto  Here’s a list of all the leading mobile trading apps that support shiba inu coin trading:  Crypto.com  Coinbase  Binance  eToroX  OKEx  Huobi Global  MEXC Global  KuCoin  How to buy SHIB in New York  New York is renowned for being one of the most heavily crypto-regulated regions in the world, and local residents are often restricted from buying digital assets or investing in new projects. Moreover, any crypto company operating in the state needs to obtain a specific license, of which less than a dozen have been granted over the years.  However, there are ways to acquire SHIB as a New York state resident without breaking the law. Coinbase, for example, recently made it possible for New York residents to purchase shiba inu coin on its licensed platform.  Another option is to use Atomic Wallet to store ether (ETH) bought from any exchange and then convert that ETH balance to SHIB using the wallet’s non-custodial, instant exchange feature.  Editor's Note: This article does not constitute investment advice and is not intended to invite or induce investment in SHIB or any other cryptocurrency. It is meant for factual and educational purposes, with respect to certain aspects of SHIB and its associated blockchain, for those who might be interested.

BIT Mining also said it expects that its continued growth in international markets will help offset the loss of business in China.  The company reported third-quarter revenue of $404.3 million, down about 9% from the previous quarter, mainly due to the suspension of its data centers in Sichuan, China, and a decrease in revenues from the mining pool business.  The miner said that it completed the migration of all of its bitcoin mining machines to the U.S. and Kazakhstan.  The shares of BIT Mining have fallen about 25% this year, while bitcoin price rose about 100%.

Under the partnership, the magazine will be launching a TIME 100 Companies list for the metaverse, and issuing a weekly newsletter dubbed Into the Metaverse. The deal is completely financed through ether, which TIME will hold on its balance sheet, company representatives told CoinDesk.  TIME has been holding bitcoin since April after being paid in the cryptocurrency for a deal with Grayscale, a CoinDesk sister company.  Investment firm Galaxy Digital has spent around $150 million on entertainment projects through its Galaxy Interactive arm, which raised another $325 million in October for further investments in the sector.  TIME President Keith A. Grossman and Galaxy Digital Communications Director Eva Casanova refused to comment on the size of the deal, but disclosed that it will run for roughly six months.  The magazine will also host educational resources on the metaverse on a new webpage, called TIME for Learning, which will launch in December under the deal, according to the press release.  Galaxy Digital will offer its expertise to help explain the metaverse and its potential, such as insights from Galaxy Interactive General Partners Sam Englebardt and Richard Kim, according to the presser.  The list will “highlight those companies that are having the most impact within the space,” some of which may be blockchain companies, while others could be providing solutions provide solutions “to make experiences within the metaverse more accessible, impactful or successful for businesses and consumers,” Grossman told CoinDesk via email.  Applications for the list will be open from Thursday until Dec. 31, according to the press release.  The idea was whiteboarded and refined over the summer to ensure the two could “educate and engage as many people as possible in web3 and the metaverse,” Casanova said via email.

Since Sam Bankman-Fried, the CEO of FTX, famously tweeted an offer to buy SOL at a price well above its market value in January, SOL is up 12,000% for the year, and it recently broke into the crypto Top 5 as measured by market cap. The price of $SOL began soaring to new all-time highs as the Solana community met in Lisbon for the network&apos;s first-ever international conference, Breakpoint. After nearly two years of enduring a global pandemic that kept everyone at home, Breakpoint was the first time many people in the Solana community met in person to discuss the future of their projects.

The deal values Bitdeer at an implied enterprise value of approximately $4 billion and was unanimously approved by the boards of both companies, the release said.  In addition to its mining centers, Bitdeer provides tech and mining services for bitcoin miners including miner procurement, transport logistics, mining datacenter design and construction, mining machine management and daily operations.  The combined company will be renamed Bitdeer Technologies Group and will remain a publicly listed company on the Nasdaq.  Following the deal’s completion, expected in the first quarter of next year, the merged firm will be led by Jihan Wu, chairman and founder of Bitdeer.  Bitdeer was spun off earlier this year by mining chip and equipment maker Bitmain, which Wu co-founded and served as chairman and CEO. The spin-off resolved a long power struggle between Wu and Bitmain’s other co-founder, Micree Zhan.  A SPAC is a company without commercial operations. It is designed to raise capital via an initial public offering and then acquire or merge with existing companies. In Blue Safari’s case, the company was focused on opportunities in Asia.

However, bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency by market value, is looking choppy amid sour forecasts made by an Australian central bank official.  “We saw institutional buying in call options at $5,000 and $6,500 strike call options over the past two days,” Patrick Chu, director of institutional sales and trading at crypto over-the-counter (OTC) trading firm Paradigm, told CoinDesk in a Telegram channel. “In the past 24 hours, nearly 80% of the flow on our platform has been for calls.”  A call option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market. Sophisticated traders often use call and put (bearish bets) options to hedges against long/short positions in the spot and futures markets.  “These trades [in calls at $5,000 and $6,500] were executed as a structure of two separate option legs, which is one of the main reasons Paradigm exists, to facilitate institutional flow,” Chu said, adding the client wanted to buy two options.”  The $5,000 strike call expiring on Dec. 31 saw a trading volume of more than 12,000 in the past 24 hours, while the $6,500 strike call has registered a volume of over 10,000 contracts. These trades were done over Paradigm and booked on Deribit, the world’s largest crypto options exchange, where one contract represents 1 ETH.  “Aside from activity in the $5,000 and $6,500 calls, we also saw interest in calls at $7,000, $10,000, and $12,000 strikes,” Chu added. Ether’s options market has consistently seen bullish flows over the past month, barring Monday’s large trade in the put options or bearish bets at $3,000 and $4,000 strikes.  Put-call skews currently paint a mixed picture with one-week and one-month gauges flashing positive values, signifying increased demand for short-term downside protection or puts. Meanwhile, three- and six-month skews remain negative, implying a bullish bias, according to data tracked by crypto derivatives research firm Skew.  Ether has fallen by more than 8% this week to near $4,200. Bitcoin has also lost 9%, and its daily chart is now signaling a bearish technical pattern called double top.  “Bitcoin has been looking tired in recent sessions after failing to extend the record run. There is now a risk for a double top on the daily chart, which, if triggered, would expose the possibility for a more profound drop towards a measured move downside extension target in the $48,000 area,” Joel Kruger, currency strategist at LMAX Digital, said.  The Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) Head of Payments Policy Tony Richards warned on Thursday that the faddish interest in cryptocurrencies could quickly end, according to a Sydney Morning Herald report.  “I think there are plausible scenarios where a range of factors could come together to significantly challenge the current fervor for cryptocurrencies so that the current speculative demand could begin to reverse and much of the price increases of recent years could be unwound,” Richards said a speech to the Australian Corporate Treasury Association.  “Households might be less influenced by fads and a fear of missing out [FOMO] and might start to pay more attention to the warnings of securities regulators and consumer protection agencies in many countries about the risks of investing in something with no issuer, no backing and highly uncertain value,” Richards added.  Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange, said expectations for a faster unwinding of stimulus by major central banks and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s rejection of a spot-based bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) could weigh over crypto prices in the short term.  In the wake of high inflation, traditional market traders are pricing a higher probability of an early interest rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Money markets see the first rate hike happening in June, followed by another in November. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange data suggest a 50% probability of a 25 basis points rate hike by July 2022.  Balani added that “bitcoin’s appears exhausted, having failed to force a convincing breakout beyond the record high zone near $65,000 for almost four weeks.” The cryptocurrency topped the April high of $64,889 on Oct. 20. However, since then, buyers have struggled to establish a foothold above the key level.  “Markets rarely spend so much time consolidating around record highs,” Balani quipped, adding that the cryptocurrency could drop to $1 trillion market valuation.”  At press time, bitcoin was changing hands near $59,400 with a market value of $1.12 trillion.

42424249,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2mKZh,1637226978,RBA Steps Up CBDC Research but Is Not Convinced There Is a Policy Case Yet: Official,"The Reserve Bank of Australia has been ramping up research into central bank digital currencies (CBDC), but is not convinced “that a strong policy case has emerged in Australia,” said Tony Richards, head of Payments Policy at the RBA.  Australia’s current payment infrastructure provides consumers with ample safe and convenient options, Richards said, addressing the Australian Corporate Treasury Association on Thursday.  However, given payments innovation around the world, providing a new form of digital money could be key to “safeguarding confidence in national monies and the role of fiat currencies at the heart of monetary, financial and payment systems,” as well as preventing big tech monopolies, Richards said.  The central bank is also looking into stablecoin regulation along with the Council of Financial Regulators (CFR), the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, he said. The impetus is that stablecoins could soon play a significant role in “the settlement of transactions in tokenized assets, or that large retail-focused stablecoins could emerge.”  If strong regulatory frameworks are set up, stablecoins could be issued by “highly rated entities,” Richards said. Such stablecoins would be safer and faster than existing ones, he added.  Once such stablecoins exist, and banks have rolled out CBDCs, “the current fervor for cryptocurrencies” could be challenged, and the use of crypto could become niche, he said.  The “speculative trend” around crypto could reverse if households start heeding regulators instead of market hype, and policymakers crack down on energy-intensive crypto mining or transaction anonymity as an enabler of crime, Richards said.  Richards also thinks that statistics on the adoption of cryptocurrencies in Australia are “implausible,” adding that the online surveys they are based on might not be representative of the population. He specifically mentioned statistics that claim around 20% of Australians hold crypto, and 5% own dogecoin.  Richards also said he has had a crypto wallet since 2014 that initially held some bitcoin, until he converted some to ether in 2018.

Contrastingly, those sitting somewhat comfortably at Capitol Hill seem to have had their feathers ruffled by the ever-growing presence of Decentralised Finance and cryptographic tokens. Increasing concerns about the lack of oversight and policy within the expanding $110 billion stablecoin market have led to the possibility of stablecoin issuers such as Tether and Circle being soon subjected to bank-like regulations. According to a report from the Wall Street Journal, the proposal is part of an upcoming stablecoin report from a Treasury-led presidential advisory group, expected to be released late this month of October. So how could these regulations potentially affect stablecoins? One way the market could change is more transparency. In a recent speech discussing the potential for the USA to have its own central bank digital currency, pro-crypto Senator Cynthia Lummis expressed concern for the authenticity of stablecoins&apos; financial backing, saying that they &apos;must be 100 percent backed by cash … and this should be audited regularly.&apos; However, not all stablecoin initiatives are created equal.

Trading volume on the platform was over $200 million in late August 2021 compared to an average of under $100,000 in December 2020, data from DappRadar shows.  Seeing these trading volumes, investors rushed to get a piece of the startup and initiated the investment process, according to the report from Wednesday.  OpenSea closed a $100 million Series B in July that brought its valuation to $1.5 billion. Andreessen Horowitz’s venture capital firm a16z led the round. The renowned VC also led OpenSea’s Series A in March.  The startup was rocked by accusations of insider trading in September, which led to the resignation of its head of product, Nate Chastain.

42420828,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYlED,1637210720,Kleiman v. Wright: The Trial Transitions From Plaintiffs to the Defense,"MIAMI — A federal civil trial over the potential ownership of 1.1 million BTC – worth about $66 billion – was interrupted on Tuesday when the defendant in the case, Dr. Craig Wright, an Australian man who claims to have invented the cryptocurrency, was accused of witness intimidation.  Just as Wright’s attorney was arguing that an expert witness testifying against Wright shouldn’t be allowed to use the word “fraud,” Wright posted in a private group on the messaging app Slack, “You know you can sue ‘experts’ who give misleading [testimony].” They shouldn’t make statements of fraud where there is no evidence of intent, he wrote.  Seeing the post, attorneys for plaintiff Ira Kleiman asked the judge to admonish the defense. “It’s a clear intimidation tactic, and it’s inappropriate,” said Velvel (Devin) Freedman.  Wright apologized, and the case continued.  The next morning, though, the plaintiffs’ attorneys dug up an earlier Slack message posted by Wright. Referring to Jamie Wilson, a former executive at several of Wright’s companies, who had appeared in a video deposition earlier in the trial, Wright had posted, “Jamie was put on notice a few weeks before his testimony that we are planning to sue him for fraud.”  Wright’s attorney’s said the comment referred to a different legal dispute and countered that Freedman had been making his own online posts – on Twitter, he’d seemed to endorse a comment that mocked Wright.  Judge Beth Bloom put an end to the bickering, saying she would not be policing online comments unless they were affecting the jury.  Basics of Kleiman v. Wright  This is the third week of a federal civil trial in which Wright is being sued by the estate of David Kleiman, represented by Ira Kleiman, a Florida man who alleges that his now-deceased brother helped Wright invent and mine bitcoin.  It is undisputed that Dave Kleiman and Wright were friends, but the case hinges on whether their relationship amounted to a business partnership.  Wright, a computer scientist and businessman, met Dave Kleiman – a military veteran turned computer expert confined to a wheelchair and living in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida – online. Wright claims to be the author of a famous white paper on which bitcoin is based. The paper was posted online in October 2008 by someone under the name “Satoshi Nakamoto.”  Who exactly is behind the Satoshi Nakamoto pseudonym is one of the modern world’s great mysteries; messages from associated accounts stopped in 2011, and 1.1 million BTC in an associated wallet has never been cashed out in dollars or moved. Wright first claimed to be Satoshi in 2016, but many skeptics deny this claim.  Read more: Why Are We Still Debating Whether Craig Wright Is Satoshi?  After Dave Kleiman died in 2013, his colleague and friend Patrick Paige forwarded Ira Kleiman an email from Craig Wright, claiming that Dave had been involved in creation of bitcoin.  Ira Kleiman sought more details from Wright, and the two were initially amicable. But over time Kleiman became suspicious, their relationship soured and Kleiman filed suit in 2018. He alleged that Wright forged documents and transferred bitcoins and intellectual property assets in which Dave had an interest to himself or his own companies.  The lawsuit alleges fraud, civil theft, unjust enrichment, misappropriation of trade secrets and more, and has demanded judgment against Wright for damages in the amount of “at least $11,427,755,048.02 and/or return of the wrongfully converted bitcoins with their forked assets,” plus the value of intellectual property, punitive damages and attorney’s fees. The bitcoin at the heart of the dispute is now worth about six times more than it was when Kleiman filed the lawsuit.  The court case focuses on hundreds of emails, tax records and other documents that indicate Wright moved assets among various entities around the world. Sometimes Wright referred to Dave Kleiman as a partner; other times he downplayed his involvement.  Authenticity of documents called into question  Matthew Edman, director in the Cyber Security & Investigations practice at Berkeley Research Group, began testifying Monday afternoon and continued most of the day Tuesday. He explained that he looked at dozens of documents, examining their content, metadata and cryptographic signatures. His testimony focused on 10 he deemed forgeries.  Read more: In Craig Wright Trial, Plaintiffs Lay Out Pattern of Fraud, Deceit and Hubris  Documents that were purportedly created in 2011, 2012 or 2013 had time stamps showing they were not created until 2014, Edman testified. One document referenced a bitmessage ostensibly from 2012, but Bitmessage creator Jonathan Warren testified last week that the social messaging program was not publicly available until months after the message was purportedly sent.  Another document was written in a Microsoft font but, according to Edman, the font did not exist at the time the document was dated.  On cross-examination, Wright’s attorney, Andres Rivero, tried to poke holes in Edman’s credibility, arguing that any alterations to documents were not necessarily made by Wright, that metadata can be unintentionally modified when saved or transferred, and other such points.  The Wright defense takes over  On Tuesday afternoon, the plaintiffs rested their case and the defense began calling witnesses. Attorneys for Wright began their defense by seeking to downplay Dave Kleiman’s skills, health and importance in Craig Wright’s life.  Kevin Madura, a cybersecurity expert and senior vice president at AlixPartners,LLP in Washington, D.C., was called to testify late Tuesday and continued on Wednesday. He laid out a timeline of the development of Bitcoin and described Dave Kleiman’s computer expertise. He indicated that Kleiman did not know how to code.  Read more: Kleiman v. Wright Trial: Craig Wright’s Flinty 4-Day Testimony Comes to an End  “The development of the Satoshi code by Dave Kleiman would be highly inconsistent with his skill and experience,” Madura said. He was “not a skilled programmer in any language, let alone C ++,” the language of the Satoshi code.  On cross-examination, however, Madura conceded that he’d only looked at a resume of Kleiman’s that had been provided to him by Wright and that it was possible Kleiman had taught himself to code.  He added that he was not offering an opinion about whether Dave Kleiman could have contributed to the development of Bitcoin outside of coding the software.  Next up was Nicholas J. Chambers, a digital forensics expert and senior vice president in the Investigations, Dispute and Risks practice at AlixPartners. He explained how computer files are organized, likening them to a library card catalog that has shelves and books in a certain order. “If you throw out the card catalog, it’s hard to tell what was there, where one file ends and begins, how the shelves were organized,” he said.  After Dave Kleiman died, Ira Kleiman had reformatted his brother’s hard drives, leaving 13 of 14 drives with overwritten data and similarly messing up the files, he testified.  A ‘mutual admiration club’  In a video deposition, Lynn Wright, Craig Wright’s ex-wife, testified she recalled Craig Wright writing a paper about digital money, but not bitcoin specifically.  “He was always writing papers,” she said. He’d once asked her to do research about how bitcoin could be taxed, but didn’t recall him ever saying he was mining bitcoin and didn’t have specific knowledge of his bitcoin holdings, business dealings or net worth. She had been a shareholder at W&K Info Defense Research, a business set up with Dave Kleiman to get work contracts in the U.S.  Once, she and Craig had met with Dave Kleiman in the Orlando area, where they traveled for a conference. “We met with him for supper or even to sit around and chat and have drinks, that sort of thing. ... They had a mutual admiration club going on there.”  After her testimony came a video deposition of Don Lynam, Wright’s maternal uncle, who’d been in the Australian Air Force and then worked in software development. “Back when Craig was doing cryptography work, he sent me papers,” Lynam said.  One of them described a system of digital money. Lynam said he understood it to be an early draft of what would become the Bitcoin white paper. He described it as highly technical and poorly written with a “lot of mathematics and graphs.”  Lynam was aware that around 2009 Wright needed an extensive network of computers to run nodes to verify bitcoin transactions. While Lynam assumed Wright would have had some help with his project, Wright had never mentioned working with Dave Kleiman. Lynam only heard the name later, looked online and saw Kleiman had co-authored some books with Wright.  “Craig did not discuss, in any way that I can recall, Dave Kleiman – [not] in writing this book nor up to and during the bitcoin thing. He absolutely did not,” Lynam said.  The day closed out with Dr. D. Stewart MacIntyre, Jr., a medical doctor who testified that, because Dave was a paraplegic following a motorcycle accident, he suffered from bedsores and infections and other problems, and, except for a few days, was confined to a hospital during the last years of his life.  MacIntyre’s testimony is expected to continue on Thursday.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Deirdra Funcheon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/18/kleiman-v-wright-the-trial-transitions-from-plaintiffs-to-the-defense,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/52e66e2ba60682330f79e04e37324d3c4fb3fbfc-4990x3323.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
