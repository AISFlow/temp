Whether it’s creating an .onion address for a member's site, setting up the Onion-Location feature for an .onion site (which lets users navigate domains more easily) or integrating applications into the Tor network, these Onion Advisors can help, according to Bagueros.  “We decided to create a program inspired by what Tor is based on, community,” said Bagueros. “Our goal is to build a supportive relationship between our nonprofit and private sector organizations that use our technology or want to support our mission.”    Read More: Start9 Labs Pitches a Private At-Home Server.

42422100,nAPHWRwYo7WGMD8VryKahz,1598907341,A New Attempt to Tokenize Real Estate Projects in Mexico and Canada,"MountX Real Estate Capital has licensed transfer agent Vertalo to design and launch tokens for at least 15 digital real estate projects in Mexico and Canada through 2020 and early 2021, the firms announced last week.      According to a press statement, this is the third of four planned deals by Vertalo’s real estate division (VRE), launched this past June, that focuses on the tokenization of real estate assets. Vertalo is one of the few transfer agents – Securities and Exchange Commission-registered record keepers – in the crypto industry.      Real estate tokenization once looked like an extremely popular blockchain use case that promised to disrupt the global real estate market, with crypto firms like AlphaPoint and Harbor launching initiatives to put real estate assets on a blockchain. However, investors didn’t immediately take to the new promise of trading tokenized pieces of properties on a public ledger.      See also: tZERO Plans to Support Trading of Aspencoin Ski Resort Digital Security      One problem was that issuers had to get tokens out to increase liquidity, while institutions wanted to see liquidity before they changed their operations. Multiple deals have fallen apart as a result, including Harbor’s partnership with the real estate division of Chicago-based DRW Holdings.      Vertalo co-founder and CEO Dave Hendricks told CoinDesk the 2018 “hype cycle” for real estate tokenization was about two years ahead of the implementation of the technologies needed to make it a reality.      According to Hendricks, although tokenization of real estate had been possible for three years, the alternative trading systems (ATS) and exchanges that could trade these digital debt instruments had not received regulatory approval.      “Another missing piece was the digital transfer agent – like Vertalo – that could manage the shareholder data for proper record keeping purposes,” Hendricks said.      Now, 2020 has seen a rekindled interest in the sector. In February, commercial real estate platform Red Swan partnered with token platform Polymath to tokenize $2.2 billion in real estate assets. In April, Vertalo signed a deal with trading platform tZERO to tokenize a real estate portfolio worth $300 million.      See also: Tokensoft Teams With Signature Bank to Launch Real Estate Security Token Platform      VRE’s new partnership with MountX will facilitate direct investments in Class-A residential properties located in Canada. MountX will be conducting multiple issuances: initial deals will only be promoted to Latin American investors, and eventually expand to include U.S. and Canadian markets. According to the statement, through the digital tokens, investors will be able to directly access their equity and asset information.      “The international aspect of this deal highlights the limitless potential of issuing digital equity of real estate assets,” the statement said.      Traditionally, many real estate offerings are marketed quietly to insiders, but MountX’s work with Vertalo broadens access and improves the chances that a retail investor can invest in or offer their properties on the MountX platform, Alec Beckman, director of business development at Vertalo told CoinDesk.      “Real estate is something that not many people have been able to invest in before. You have to know or get connected with a real estate general partner, or understand how to build a portfolio yourself,” Beckman said.      Currently 99% of private real estate capital is raised under the Reg D exemption, which means it is only available to accredited investors, Beckman said, adding that digital assets will give accredited investors a chance to participate in real estate investment opportunities.      Beckman also said Vertalo is working on a digitization project that would allow overseas and non-accredited investors the opportunity to invest in real estate assets.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/08/31/a-new-attempt-to-tokenize-real-estate-projects-in-mexico-and-canada,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0a97ac5e09964c31e9e65feac1f71465b2ddf401-2560x1695.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422094,nAPHWRwYo7WGMD8VryKaMS,1598905726,What the Fed's New Inflation Policy Means for Stablecoins,"Alexander Lipton is the CTO of Sila, a visiting professor and Dean’s Fellow at the Jerusalem Business School of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and a Connection Science Fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.      On Aug. 27, the Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell gave a widely watched speech entitled ""New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review"" at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium. In his remarks, Powell announced the Fed would allow inflation to run above its long-term 2% level. More immediately, the Fed will continue with its policy of keeping the Fed funds rate at (almost) zero and buying Treasury bonds to the tune of $80 billion a month.      To put things in perspective, the Fed’s total assets stood at $4.3 trillion in March, and $6.6 trillion in August – a massive increase due to the purchases of U.S. Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities. It is very likely the Fed funds rate will stay at zero for a prolonged period of time – probably for the next five years. In comparison, in Japan, short rates have stayed at or below zero (with a short intermission) for 20 years.      See also: Frances Coppola - Mr. Powell, If You Want Higher Inflation, Give People Money      In theory, the Fed's massive money printing and the associated ballooning of its balance sheet undertaken to fight the economic impact of COVID-19 would lead to heightened inflation. In practice, inflation stays fairly low due to the global economy's overall weakness and reduced demand. One possible explanation is that due to the high degree of economic uncertainty, both individuals and businesses tend to hoard their money rather than spend it.      In particular, banks, which under normal circumstances are eager to lend, tend to keep their assets at the Fed. Thus, commercial banks are moving away from the fractional reserve to the narrow bank model, while the Fed operates more as a fractional reserve bank. Although Powell's announcement is of little immediate consequence, in the long term it will have profound implications for the price of equities, oil, gold and cryptos, and, more broadly, to the modus operandi of the entire financial system.      At present, deposits at all U.S. commercial banks are $15.6 trillion. At the same time, the total capitalization of all U.S. dollar–based stablecoins is about $15 billion. Banks pay no interest to their customers, thus enjoying access to deposits as a lucrative source of free funding. Yet, despite this deposit advantage, the position of banks is unstable in the long run. They can no longer offer competitive interest rates on deposits and the FDIC insurance proposals cannot offer protection to consumers in the case of any major bank defaults.    It will have profound implications for the price of equities, oil, gold and cryptos, and, more broadly, to the modus operandi of the entire financial system.    While immensely popular among the crypto natives to help ease in and out of trading positions, at present stablecoins have a limited impact on the broader economy. Stablecoins have to provide clear advantages compared to bank deposits to become economically significant to garner mass adoption.  Staking of tokens for returns is currently offering very competitive rates, but this will likely come down to a more sustainable 2% deposit rate. This could provide an attractive hedge to the 2% inflation target, but it is likely that within a decade, the total share of deposits kept in fiat-backed stablecoins or central bank digital currencies will grow dramatically. This is due to the flexibility in payments which stablecoin payments and programmable money offers, especially for businesses and institutions, if not retail consumers initially.      Stablecoins have made a dramatic impact already, but to make a larger impact on the global economy, they must fulfill broader needs.      First, they need to sever their connections to banks as collateral holders and find a regulatory-compliant way to keep collateral outside of the existing banking system. If this is not done, stablecoins will create inflationary pressure, since collateral kept with banks will trickle into the real economy and result in both stablecoin and collateral circulating in the system.      Stablecoins that provide value and options outside of the banking system is what crypto was created to do – something that currency stablecoins currently lack. In this regard, the so-called Digital Trade Coin, one of the original asset-backed stablecoins, proposed by Thomas Hardjono, Alex Pentland and myself in 2018, is particularly attractive, especially if the corresponding collateral has a positive carry.      See also: Alex Lipton - Stablecoins Are the Bridge From Central Banks to Consumer Payments      Second, stablecoins have to make money genuinely programmable. While Bitcoin's Pay to Script Hash (P2SH) transactions, and Ethereum's Smart Contracts provide some programmability opportunities frequently used by experts, they are too hard to understand by regular economic agents to be essential. For example, programmable money would have expedited the distribution of stimulus checks and saved billions of dollars in the process compared to the archaic way the Treasury Department does it at present.      Third, stablecoins have to lose their national aspects and acquire meaningful cross-border features. The Fed's new policy naturally facilitates the transformation of stablecoins from the national to the supranational level by the fact that all the developed economies are more or less on par and pay nothing on deposits.      In summary, changes in the Fed's policy open a real possibility for building the new economy based on programmable money and regularly complaint payment rails operating entirely (or mostly) outside of the existing banking system. The broad expansion of payment mechanisms will democratize finance and make it much more inclusive and equitable. It will also force banks to become more nimble and agile to remain economically relevant.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | COMMODITY | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Alexander Lipton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/08/31/what-the-feds-new-inflation-policy-means-for-stablecoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/41c854d1cad703b69ccc3e34ac189a147fceaeb3-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The index continues to drop, down 0.12% Monday and hitting fresh lows for 2020.      Crypto stakeholders are watching the equities market.

Uniswap’s daily trading volume is surpassing centralized exchanges such as Coinbase, which had $433 million the past 24 hours. Uniswap has over $10 billion total volume traded, according to Dune Analytics.      “I think there is no denying that DeFi is a thing,” said George Clayton, managing partner at Cryptanalysis Capital. “Traders are spending over $400,000 per day in gas fees on Uniswap alone,” he added.      However, there continues to be a caveat with all of this DeFi frenzy, added Clayton – the Ethereum network needs to scale in order to successfully meet this increasing demand. “Maybe centralized exchanges' days really are numbered,” he said. “But not until the scaling issue is solved.

42422106,nAPHWRwYo7WGMD8VryKb7p,1598901006,Bitsonar Whistleblower Says Law Enforcement Faked His Murder in Attempt to Protect Him,"The whistleblower from defunct cryptocurrency firm Bitsonar has reappeared after going missing for three days in Kyiv, Ukraine, saying law enforcement faked his kidnapping – and murder – to foil a genuine attempt on his life.      Yaroslav Shtadchenko went missing last Thursday, with video evidence suggesting he had been abducted. He contacted CoinDesk on Monday afternoon local time, saying that he was safe. He said that the Security Service of Ukraine (SSU) had staged the event after his murder had been ordered.      SSU reported Monday that it had used such tactics to foil an attempted contract killing, with an agent posing as a hitman to fool the would-be client, though the law enforcement agency did not name anyone involved.      Read more: Whistleblower Kidnapped in Ukraine After Accusing Crypto Firm of Exit Scam      The announcement is the latest bizarre twist in a cautionary tale about crypto investment schemes. Investors in Bitsonar have been trying to recoup millions of dollars worth of digital currency from the platform since February.      ""It was not a kidnapping, but a special operation, as it turned out. I didn't know about it,"" Shtadchenko told CoinDesk. He said he was taken into a minivan on his way home by a group of men, who explained once they were in the car it was an elaborate ruse. (In the video, he appears to be genuinely terrified as men push him into the vehicle.)      His lawyer, Yuriy Demchenko, confirmed his client was safe and that the SSU staged the crime to arrest a man who ordered the killing. The SSU did not share his name, Demchenko said.    Elaborate setup    Shtadchenko’s “kidnapping” occurred just days after he announced he would be contacting law enforcement agencies in different countries to report his allegation that the founder of Bitsonar, Alexander Tovstenko, absconded with some $2.5 million of investor money. Shtadchenko gave interviews, published information about the firm and called for investors to unite and pursue legal action.      The SSU issued a press release (warning: link contains disturbing content) on Monday saying it ""prevented the contract killing of an IT businessman."" The details of the case are consistent with Shtadchenko’s account:    ""The officers of the special service established that a resident of Kyiv was looking for a killer to kill a business partner. The client had a conflict with the victim due to joint transactions in a well-known company that dealt with cryptocurrencies and has some features of the so-called Ponzi scheme. The attacker priced the life of the partner at five thousand U.S. dollars.Law enforcement officers imitated the disappearance and then murder of the victim in the Holosiivskyi district of Kyiv, after which they reported his execution.”    The press release contains a photo of Shtadchenko with a simulated bullet hole in his head. The photo was provided to the fake hitman's would-be client in exchange for the second part of the reward, the SSU wrote.      The agency also published a video of agents detaining the man who allegedly ordered the killing. The man's face is blurred in the video, which shows a pile of cash he was about to pay to the “hitman.” The operation took place in Odessa, a seaside resort in Ukraine.      According to Demchenko, staging a killing allows the SSU to charge the suspect with a more serious crime: a completed contract killing instead of an assassination attempt.      The SSU has done this in the past: in 2018, Russian journalist Arkady Babchenko was reportedly killed in Kyiv, but later the SSU said it staged the shooting and prevented an assasination attempt.      Bitsonar attracted investors from the U.S., Canada, U.K., Denmark, Norway, Netherland, Finland and other countries, reaching them in part via YouTube influencer videos.

According to the indictment unsealed on Friday, Denni Jali, a South African citizen who used to live in Maryland, together with Maryland residents Arley Ray Johnson and John Erasmus Frimpong, persuaded people to invest in a cryptocurrency and foreign-exchange trading fund they ran.      Instead of investing it, the three men allegedly used the money to fund their extravagant lifestyles, the indictment notes.    “They used the victims’ hard-earned money for luxury cars, private jets and family vacations while the victims ended up with false promises,” said FBI Special Agent in Charge Jennifer Boone, in the press release posted on the DOJ’s website.  While those looking to defraud people have often used complex financial products as cover, behavior like what is alleged to have occurred here highlights how a key part of democratizing any financial market is ensuring consumers have better information about what they’re buying.  According to the indictment, the three men marketed their firm, 1st Million, as a wealth management and financial literacy firm and attracted investors by hosting events at expensive venues and attending church-sponsored events.  1st Million allegedly offered contracts guaranteeing investors would have monthly rates of return ranging from 6% to 35% of their initial investments “regardless of market volatility,” according to the indictment.  Jali left the United States in May 2019 but was later arrested in South Africa, according to the DOJ’s press release. According to court documents, Frimpong was arrested in Maryland and, as reported by the Associated Press, Johnson is expected to surrender to authorities today.

42422093,nAPHWRwYo7WGMD8VryKaDq,1598893439,Venezuelans Look to Crypto-Dollars for Financial Security,"Alejandro Machado is a co-founder of the Open Money Initiative, a non-profit research organization working to guarantee the right to a free and open financial system. He heads research efforts at Valiu, a crypto startup that serves Venezuelans.      Venezuela is dollarizing: About 64% of transactions in the country take place in U.S. dollars now. The majority of these are cash transactions, as local banks don’t offer dollar checking or savings accounts for the masses. As a result, Venezuelans have to handle two kinds of suboptimal money: digital bolivars that quickly lose their value, and physical dollars that are dangerous to store in one of the world’s most crime-ridden countries.      In theory, crypto-dollars should fill this space, and dollar-stable assets that anyone can hold have seen a demand spike in the last few months, even if so far the global trend is only beginning to take hold in Venezuela.      See also: Chainalysis Report Shows Healthy Crypto Usage in Venezuela      Bitcoin day traders don’t want to be exposed to the asset’s overnight volatility, so they convert their working capital to tether, the leading stablecoin. Forex traders with bank accounts in Panama or the U.S. are beginning to trade dollars in the banking systems of those countries for USDC (another stablecoin) in private WhatsApp groups. And platforms like Binance P2P have just added support for the bolivar, allowing people to trade them for BUSD directly.      Cryptocurrency startups have mostly attracted two kinds of users: traders and technology enthusiasts, but no company has yet made a convincing case for regular people – neither traders nor the especially tech-savvy – to use these assets as money. Given Venezuela’s unique circumstances, the stage is set for this to change.    What makes crypto-dollarization so powerful? Inclusion.    Valiu, the company where I work as Head of Research, offers a mobile app where any Venezuelan can hold a digital dollar balance that can be converted, with one tap, to bolivars, leveraging the growing trading ecosystem without showing this complexity to the user.      Little do most people know, and little do they care, that these dollar balances are crypto-dollars: assets backed by bitcoin and derivatives that are liquid enough to be readily converted to assets that people already recognize as money.      What makes crypto-dollarization so powerful? Inclusion. It is estimated some 20% of dollar transactions in Venezuela go through platforms such as Zelle that require a U.S. bank account to sign up and that in turn require a passport, a visa, a flight ticket and an arbitrary approval by a bank officer.      See also: A Rare Glimpse Into How Crypto Is Really Used in Venezuela      Most U.S. banks don’t need Venezuelan customers to thrive, so they have been shutting down their accounts. This places an artificial limit to the growth, and even the maintenance, of digital dollar accounts that depend on traditional financial institutions. Accounts that are powered by cryptocurrency, and that are supported by dedicated firms, can be made to have much fewer user-facing requirements. A smartphone may be the only physical equipment a person needs to get an account.      As an industry, we need to target specific populations and get to the point where the technology changes lives. Through our research at the Open Money Initiative and Valiu, we have learned a few insights specific to the region that we want to serve.      First, people trust mobile apps more than web sites for their finances (and many, many people aren’t even aware their phone has a browser – their whole digital world is the Google Play Store).      See also: Nic Carter - Policymakers Shouldn’t Fear Digital Money: So Far It’s Maintaining the Dollar’s Status      Second, it’s important to prioritize support for low-end devices and reliability under low connectivity. This is how WhatsApp won over the world’s communication, and this is how the world’s most inclusive financial app will win, too.      And third, regular people do want to trust a branded entity with their money. Unfortunately, bitcoin is currently not the best brand. Many associate it with the petro – the unpopular Maduro-issued cryptocurrency – after countless state TV mentions. Most don’t want trustless systems. They want greater choice as to whom they trust.      Most important: Only assets and technology that don’t need to be explained can really earn the trust needed for mass adoption.

42422107,nAPHWRwYo7WGMD8VryKbC8,1598890799,"Blockchain Bites: Ethereum Classic Attacked, Electrum Wallet Drained and Taxable Microtasks","Signature Bank gave out dozens more small business PPP loans to crypto firms than previously known, Ethereum Classic has suffered another 51% attack and a digital yuan wallet went live and disappeared this weekend.      You’re reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they’re significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.    Top shelf    Third attack The Ethereum Classic blockchain suffered its third, and worst, 51% attack in a month Saturday evening. Spotted by mining company Bitfly, the attack reorganized over 7,000 blocks, or two days' worth of mining, compared to 3,693 and 4,000 blocks in the first two attacks, CoinDesk Zack Voell reports. ETC Cooperative, a foundation supporting the network's development, said it was “aware” of the attack and “working with others to test and evaluate proposed solutions as quickly as possible."" FTX will reconsider its ETC perpetual futures contracts, CEO Sam Bankman-Fried told CoinDesk, following actions earlier this month by OKex and Coinbase to consider delisting ETC and extending confirmation times for the cryptocurrency, respectively. ETC Labs, recently announced it would implement additional security features.      Crypto loans Signature Bank extended about $20 million to roughly 40 firms in the digital asset space under the federal Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), dozens more than was previously reported. CEO Joseph DePaolo would not name nor confirm the number of firms receiving PPP loans, though he said the bank’s crypto PPP loan volume was due to other banks serving crypto not having the resources to offer the same kind of program. Previously, CoinDesk reported that at least $30 million had been extended to crypto companies by several banks including JPMorgan Chase, Silicon Valley Bank, Cross River Bank and others. Signature loaned a total $1.9 billion, roughly .55% of the entire $350 billion that was disbursed, through the emergency relief program.      Backdoor hack An Electrum wallet user claims to have lost 1,400 bitcoin (~$16.2 million) after installing an older version of the software from a malicious source, CoinDesk’s Sebastian Sinclair reports. In a Sunday Github post, pseudonymous user ""1400BitcoinStolen"" said they downloaded a version of the wallet and installed a security update pop-up that triggered a transfer of the user's entire BTC balance to an address in the possession of a hacker. Electrum allows anyone to ""run their own servers or use servers that they trust,” according to another Github user seemingly associated with Electrum. If users download a version from a different source than Electrum and don't check signatures, they may ""install a backdoor.”      Yuan wallet? A public version of a digital yuan wallet quickly went live and was disabled this weekend, CoinDesk’s Wolfie Zhou reports. Around noon on Saturday local time, users of China Construction Bank (CCB), one of the big-four state-owned commercial banks, had access to a DCEP (digital currency, electronic payment) wallet feature via the bank’s mobile app. The wallet was registered with a phone number associated with their bank accounts and could be linked with their bank funds. It is unclear when CCB opened up the service, but news of the feature quickly spread Saturday among the Chinese cryptocurrency community and media, before being disabled. In app searches for “digital currency” now display: “This function is not yet officially available to the public. Please wait patiently.”      Micro taxes? Crypto microtransactions worth less than $1 are taxable events, according to a U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) memo. Responding to a request for clarification from the tax agent's own Small Business/Self Employed Division, the IRS senior technician Ronald Goldstein said cryptocurrency ""acts as a substitute for real currency"" and considered property for federal income tax purposes. One might imagine it’s like reporting cash tips. Examples of microtransactions include crypto rewards earned from downloading an app and leaving a positive review; downloading games and reaching particular milestones; completing online quizzes; or registering accounts with various online services.

The battle began in 2018, when then-OKEx CEO Chris Lee defected to Huobi to become vice president of global business development.      “There’s a natural friction between OKEx and Huobi,” Matthew Graham, chief executive officer of Beijing-based crypto consultancy Sino Global Capital, said. “While they have both pushed to enlarge their international footprints, they still prioritize their Chinese user base.”      A regional turf war takes place in the context of crypto’s illegality. Officially, Huobi doesn’t acknowledge the Chinese cryptocurrency market exists: “There is not a market in China. That is not legal,” a representative said, though Huobi appears to be getting nearly a third of its website traffic from Chinese visitors, versus 14% for OKEx, according to a website tracker.      However, other competitive fields are easier to quantify. OKEx is the world’s biggest crypto derivatives exchange, with outstanding contracts valued at $1.26 billion. Huobi trails with $1.25 billion in outstanding contracts.      The close competition has led to novel derivative products from both exchanges – though some see the real prize as winning a favored position with the Chinese government.      Last year, President Xi announced China would “seize the opportunity” of blockchain, spurring increased testing of a digital yuan, the establishment of an open blockchain-based services network and other digital infrastructure development.      On that count, Huobi might be one move ahead of OKEx: The Chinese branch of Huobi has joined the Blockchain-Based Service Network (BSN) Development Alliance, which aims to be one of the most influential infrastructure services providers in the country.    Market intel    August's end Bitcoin is eyeing an August gain for the first time in three years, but is lagging behind U.S. stocks for the month. The cryptocurrency is trading near $11,610 at press time, representing a 2.27% gain on a month-to-date basis, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index, while the S&P 500 is on track for a 7.25% gain this August. Bitcoin faced rejection at highs above 12,400 on Aug. 17 and has been restricted largely to a range of $11,100 to $11,800 ever since, CoinDesk’s markets reporter Omkar Godbole said.

Op-ed    Profound shift Last week, Chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Jerome Powell announced the central bank will allow inflation to run higher than its longstanding 2% target, without raising interest rates. CoinDesk’s Head of Research Noelle Acheson sees this as a profound shift in the role of the central bank, which might have repercussions for the crypto industry. “If 2020 teaches us one thing, it has to be that assumptions don’t last, and that we all need to be flexible. In a world where everything is undergoing a transformation, barriers come down faster. And, as uncomfortable as it may be, change is always an opportunity, especially when it comes from unexpected areas. In our industry, it’s what we’ve been hoping for,” she writes.      Inflation solution Frances Coppola, a CoinDesk columnist and author of “The Case for People’s Quantitative Easing,” thinks one way to increase inflation, which has consistently fallen below a targeted 2%, is to just give people money. “From beyond the grave, [John Maynard] Keynes sends a powerful message to today’s leaders. If you want inflation to rise, Mr. Powell, you need to get people spending. Announcing that you will permit prices to rise more quickly won’t achieve this. And neither will increasing the money supply, unless that money goes to people who are likely to spend it,” she writes.

The Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media has published a proposed bill for public feedback, which firstly provides a definition of precisely what counts as a data center.      The bill, if passed, would also obliges data centers within the nation to report their operations to the ministry's supervising agency, the internet censor Roskomnadzor.      According to the draft document, published on the government portal Friday, a data center is defined as an ""object with its own infrastructure for hosting hardware providing storage, processing and access to data, with guaranteed levels of accessibility, security and management.""      An operator of a data center must provide the agency with information about the computing capacity of such a facility, how the data is stored, which services the center provides and at what cost.

""The government needs this data to monitor the digital economy development. Right now, nobody is gathering information about data centers. On the other hand, including commercial information into such reports seems redundant,"" Runets said.

""It can attract attention of people from the [foreign] intelligence services to criminal actors,"" Kozlyuk said. The parameters for data storage, which are on the list to be reported, include sensitive information like hardware manufacturer, technical settings and software updates, he added.

42422083,nAPHWRwYo7WGMD8VryKSeR,1598881254,Signature Bank Gave Dozens More PPP Loans to Crypto Firms Than Previously Reported,"Signature Bank extended dozens more loans under the federal Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to cryptocurrency businesses than was previously reported.      Around $20 million of the $1.9 billion in PPP loans the bank extended was given to roughly 40 firms in the digital asset space, said CEO Joseph DePaolo. The executive would not name the firms it gave PPP loans to or give an exact number of firms who took out a loan through the relief program. (Signature’s $1.9 billion in loans accounts for roughly .55% of the entire $350 billion that was disbursed through the U.S. Small Business Administration.)      Public records show that Signature issued loans to a number of prominent firms in the space, including Ethereum venture studio ConsenSys, VC firm Polychain Capital and crypto lender Celsius Network.      DePaolo said the bank’s crypto PPP loan volume was due to other banks serving crypto not having the resources to offer the same kind of program. Previously, CoinDesk reported that at least $30 million had been extended to crypto companies by several banks including JPMorgan Chase, Silicon Valley Bank, Cross River Bank and others. (CoinDesk also reported Signature had extended only nine PPP loans to crypto firms.)    Not PPP-proof    The news further reveals a deeper need in the crypto industry for relief in the wake of the global economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Likewise, Signature’s program proves the bank’s commitment to the digital asset space.      Read more: Blockchain Startups Got $30M+ in US ‘PPP’ Bailout Loans      While Signature’s business is primarily focused on serving high-net-worth individuals and it does not call itself a crypto bank or refer to its digital asset team as a crypto banking division, the bank did rake in $1 billion in deposits from the sector in the second quarter 2020 alone.      “I believe I said it about a year and a half ago, that if you weren’t into blockchain technology and the digital world in five years, you would have a problem as a bank. There’s three and a half years left, and it may be sooner,” DePaolo told CoinDesk in a recent interview. “I think the situation we have right now with this pandemic and the quagmire, it’s going to make the public look at digital currencies.”    Signature Bank’s crypto awakening    In January 2018, the bank hired Joseph Seibert as the senior vice president for its digital asset banking team. Seibert started with three employees and has grown the team to 12 as of August 2020. He was previously a vice president at similarly crypto-friendly Metropolitan Commercial Bank.      The bank’s Signet payments platform is a proprietary blockchain based on the Ethereum protocol which allows for fee-less instant fiat settlement. While it’s popular within the digital asset space, firms outside of the space, such as renewable energy companies, use Signet to settle thousands of transactions a day without dealing with the payment friction between suppliers and wholesale distributors.      Read more: Signature Bank’s Crypto Deposits Grew $1B in Q2      Seibert added that Signet has the same capabilities as the Silvergate Exchange Network but is built on blockchain versus the bank’s internal systems.      “We have the same ecosystem they have and did it in under three years,” he said.    ‘Octopus’ approach    The bank started out by serving exchanges, which Seibert calls “the octopus” because of how many firms that need banking services in crypto are tied directly to the exchanges. The bank now serves proprietary traders, hedge funds, custody firms, mining farms and other verticals in the space, he said.      Signature does treat firms in the digital asset space carefully, to offset transactional costs for traditional payment rails (wires and ACH payments). For instance, digital asset exchanges on Signet have to keep 30% of their balance in a non-interest bearing account.

The Korea Times reported Monday that the Bank of Korea (BoK) is now seeking a consulting partnership to bring the second phase of its CBDC plan to fruition.  Once through the application process, the successful local company would assist the central bank in building the architecture for the CBDC, which is being prepared in the face of China's drive to be the first major nation to launch a digital version of its fiat currency.  China's ""DC/EP"" digital yuan system is now in testing at banks and commercial enterprises in a number of regions.  The first review phase of the BoK's work on a CBDC was completed last month, per the report, and the findings will feed the next stage of the work.  The architecture would set out aspects of the planned system such as security, how data is handled and possible applications.  The Times said a pilot is planned for late 2021.  ""The BOK will team up with a consulting partner to map out the overall work process and architecture to operate the digital currency system,"" a BoK official was quoted as saying.  They would also arrive at ""specific action plans"" to deliver the pilot in time, they added.  Will the development has been hastened this year, the central bank doesn't plan to launch a CBDC soon, but is rather preparing the ground for a time when other national currencies go digital.

We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.    Market moves    Cryptocurrency exchange Huobi is taking aim at competitor OKEx in the business of trading bitcoin futures and other derivatives contracts, opening up a new front in a longstanding rivalry between the Chinese-led exchanges.      OKEx, which is led by Chinese executives and based in Malta, is the world’s biggest crypto derivatives exchange, with outstanding contracts valued at $1.26 billion, according to the data site CoinGecko. Huobi, also led by Chinese brass but based in Singapore, is close behind, tied for second place with another exchange, BitMEX, at $1.25 billion.      In a report this month, Huobi said it has “managed to push new boundaries against other well-established exchanges when it comes to futures trading volume.” Huobi is already beating OKEx in a few market segments, according to the report, including “coin-margined futures” – where traders can post their initial down payment, known as margin, using cryptocurrencies. Huobi claims to also regularly beat OKEx in weekly and quarterly bitcoin futures contracts.      “Before Huobi launched its futures contract in December 2018, OKEx had the largest market share of the world,” Ciara Sun, vice president of Huobi Global Markets, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “Huobi Futures always looks up to the best of the market.”      The battle for supremacy in cryptocurrency futures – and China – adds to the tension between the two exchanges, which have been at loggerheads at least since 2018, when then-OKEx CEO Chris Lee defected to Huobi to become vice president of global business development.      OKEx CEO Jay Hao, in a company update in March, called Huobi “our doppelgänger,” insisted “imitation was the sincerest form of flattery” and said he “would like to think that Huobi was able to withstand this market volatility by following our footsteps.”      Experts on China’s often-murky cryptocurrency markets say the rivalry between the two exchanges likely stems from the fight for customers in the world’s second-largest economy.      “There’s a natural friction between OKEx and Huobi,” Matthew Graham, chief executive officer of Beijing-based crypto consultancy Sino Global Capital, told CoinDesk in an email. “While they have both pushed to enlarge their international footprints, they still prioritize their Chinese user base.”      Read more: Huobi and OKEx Battle for Supremacy in China      - Muyao Shen    Bitcoin watch    While bitcoin is eyeing an August gain for the first time in three years, the cryptocurrency is lagging U.S. stocks over the month.

It was the first time the cryptocurrency gained in August since 2017, when prices rallied by 66%.  As of Friday, the S&P 500, Wall Street's benchmark stocks index, was eyeing a 7.25% gain for August, as per data provided by TradingView.  Bitcoin faced rejection at highs above 12,400 on Aug. 17 and has been restricted largely to a range of $11,100 to $11,800 ever since.  The rally from July lows below $9,000 has stalled with the weakening of demand from institutions and macro traders, as indicated by the recent 30% decline in open positions in futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

42422082,nAPHWRwYo7WGMD8VryKSa8,1598875283,"Meet Torus, the One-Click Blockchain Wallet Trying to Make Web3 as Easy as Chrome","People may like the idea of blockchains and web 3.0, but they tend to hit an immediate obstacle in the form of private cryptographic keys and mnemonic seed phrases that cannot be lost, forgotten or divulged at any cost.      Private key management specialist Torus replaces that jarring user experience with what appears to be a familiar single login, but one that’s reinforced behind the scenes by a clever distributed architecture built for web 3.0.      Announced Monday, the Singapore-based startup has released a one-click Chrome browser extension for its Torus wallet and added a new product called tKey, a custom version of two-factor authentication (2FA). The extension will also work in Brave.      Read more: Torus Goes Blockchain-Agnostic With New DirectAuth Dapp Login Tool      When information is exchanged online, users don’t want to know about the underlying public key infrastructure (PKI) – and so it should be with blockchains and the next generation of the internet, or “Web3,” said Torus Labs CEO Zhen Ju Yong.      But while people don’t want that tricky user interface, they do, of course, want to control the process in a decentralized manner, Zhen added.      “Our goal is to make key management convenient to the mainstream user – my parents, for example – to be able to use crypto, while still retaining the level of security and non-custodiality which is needed for decentralized applications,” Zhen said in an interview. “We’ve always seen ourselves more as a key management company rather than a wallet. We are kind of a step up for wallets, more like an infrastructure layer.”    How Torus works    At a high level, Torus splits and distributes sensitive data needed to construct a user’s private key between the user and nodes on the Torus network, which includes Binance, Ethereum Name Service (ENS), Etherscan, Matic Network, Ontology, Skale, Tendermint Core and Zilliqa.      Distributed key generation is generally divided into three parts, or “secret shares” (Shamir's Secret Sharing, or SSS, for the technically conversant), with two held by the user and the third further split across the Torus network.      Read more: Torus Launches to Bring One-Click Login to Web 3.0      The new tKey release allows users to easily add and control incremental layers of security, a kind of customizable 2FA that works like a smart contract, said Zhen. An obvious extra security layer to add would be a mobile phone, which could store a user’s additional secret share in its secure enclave, protected by a biometric passcode. If the user has more than one mobile device, they could add as many layers of security as they want.      Similar to other 2FA systems, as long as the user has access to two out of three of their secret shares, they will be able to retrieve their private keys and login.    ‘On the shoulders of giants’    For many users, logging into dapps is done by authenticating with MetaMask, the kind of default Ethereum browser wallet. Torus has built on top of MetaMask (although it should be mentioned that the ConsenSys-backed plugin recently changed its licensing) to create its new Chrome extension.      “We greatly appreciate the MetaMask team's hard work and development,” Torus wrote in a press statement. “However, due to Torus’ necessity of being open source, Torus Extension (forked from 22 June 2020) continues to use its older MIT license.”      Zhen described the arrangement as “building on the shoulders of giants” and stressed that Torus is not seeking an edge over MetaMask.      “By no means do we feel like we want to compete with MetaMask. We’re actually in talks with MetaMask with regards to their licensing changes, and about potentially integrating,” he said.      Read more: Multicoin, Binance, Coinbase Invest in Startup Keeping Private Keys Secure      In July of last year, Torus raised a $2 million seed round led by Multicoin Capital including Coinbase Ventures and Binance Labs, while testing the first version of hassle-free login using Gmail, akin to OAuth protocol on the internet.      Torus has always had a close relationship with Binance, which invested $500,000 in the seed round, and the largest exchange by volume is now playing a central role in the new Torus product releases.      “We’re super-excited that Binance actually co-developed tKey with us, and it’s going to be an open-source SDK,” said Zhen. “We are launching this together. Along with this SDK, Binance itself and the Chrome extension for Binance DEX and Smart Chain is going to have both Torus and tKey integrated into it as one of the core key management flows.”",POSITIVE,ENS,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | BNB | ENS,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/08/31/meet-torus-the-one-click-blockchain-wallet-trying-to-make-web3-as-easy-as-chrome,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e7efb66e5505056d3467aa25efeb7e1df350f601-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422084,nAPHWRwYo7WGMD8VryKSik,1598873498,US Stocks Closing on Bigger August Gain Than Bitcoin,"While bitcoin is eyeing an August gain for the first time in three years, the cryptocurrency is still lagging U.S. stocks for the month.    Bitcoin is trading near $11,610 at press time, representing a 2.27% gain on a month-to-date basis, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  The cryptocurrency last printed gains in August in 2017, when prices rallied by 66%.  As of Friday, the S&P 500, Wall Street's benchmark stocks index, was eyeing a 7.25% gain for August, as per data provided by TradingView.  Bitcoin faced rejection at highs above 12,400 on Aug. 17 and has been restricted largely to a range of $11,100 to $11,800 ever since.  The rally from July lows below $9,000 has stalled with the weakening of demand from institutions and macro traders, as indicated by the recent 30% decline in open positions in futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  On Friday, CME-listed open interest was $653 million, down from the record high of $948 million reached on Aug. 17, according to data source Skew.  Bitcoin's rally from $9,000 to $12,400 observed in the four weeks to Aug. 17 was accompanied by a 150% surge in open interest.  It's possible investors have been rotating money out of bitcoin and into cryptocurrencies linked to the white-hot decentralized finance (DeFi) space.  The Lend token from decentralized lending platform Aave has gained 150% this month.  Other DeFi names like oracle provider Chainlink's LINK token and lending project Compound's COMP token have added 108% and 55%, respectively.  Ethereum's ether cryptocurrency is also outshining bitcoin on a monthly basis with over 20% gains.  Looking ahead, however, negative-yielding government bonds are expected to continue powering gains in both bitcoin and stocks.  And bitcoin, a perceived store of value, may draw stronger buying interest than stocks, with expectations for U.S. inflation beginning to accelerate in response to the Federal Reserve's recent decision to signal tolerance for higher prices.  Bitcoin is still down 40% from its record high of $20,000 and looks relatively undervalued compared to U.S. stocks, which are trading at record highs even amid the ongoing coronavirus epidemic.  A potential correction in stocks still poses downside risks to bitcoin, according to Joel Kruger, a currency strategist at LMAX Digital.  ""Bitcoin is still an emerging asset and therefore still somewhat exposed in periods of risk off,"" Kruger told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.

In a Sunday post on GitHub, the individual described the loss of more than 1,400 bitcoin (worth around $16.2 million at press time) as a result of ""foolishly"" installing an old version of the lightweight wallet.  Going by the username ""1400BitcoinStolen,"" they described how a pop-up message asked to update their security prior to being allowed to transfer any funds.  Upon installing a purported ""security update"" for the wallet, it immediately triggered a transfer of the user's entire balance to an address in the possession of a hacker.  Binance's CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao has moved to blacklist the stolen funds from his exchange, stating users should ""beware of this Electrum official update.""  1400BitcoinStolen said they had contacted blockchain analytics company Coinfirm for assistance in tracking the bitcoin and were awaiting a response.  Electrum has been around since 2011 and has gone through multiple updates while also being unable to stop bad actors exploiting previous versions by Sybil attacks using malicious servers.  Another member on the GutHub thread, ""gits7r"" – who seems to be associated with Electrum – said the problem comes from the decision by the team early on to allow users to ""run their own servers or use servers that they trust.""  If users download a version from a different source than electrum.org and don't check signatures, they may ""install a backdoored Electrum,"" gits7r said.  In 2018, the Electrum network suffered such an attack from a bad actor who created multiple fake servers on the Electrum network that saw 245 bitcoin siphoned from unsuspecting victims.

42422085,nAPHWRwYo7WGMD8VryKSrM,1598868000,Huobi and OKEx Battle for Supremacy in China,"Cryptocurrency exchange Huobi is taking aim at competitor OKEx in China, specifically the business of trading bitcoin futures and other derivatives contracts. The fight opens a new front in a longstanding rivalry.      OKEx, which is led by Chinese executives and based in Malta, is the world’s biggest crypto derivatives exchange, with outstanding contracts valued at $1.26 billion, according to the data site CoinGecko. Huobi, also led by Chinese brass but based in Seychelles is close behind, tied for second place with another exchange, BitMEX, at $1.25 billion.      In a report this month, Huobi said it has “managed to push new boundaries against other well-established exchanges when it comes to futures trading volume.” Huobi is already beating OKEx in a few market segments, according to the report, including “coin-margined futures” – where traders can post their initial down payment, known as margin, using cryptocurrencies. Huobi claims to also regularly beat OKEx in weekly and quarterly bitcoin futures contracts.      “Before Huobi launched its futures contract in December 2018, OKEx had the largest market share of the world,” Ciara Sun, vice president of Huobi Global Markets, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “Huobi Futures always looks up to the best of the market.”      The battle for supremacy in cryptocurrency futures – and China – adds to the tension between the two exchanges, which have been at loggerheads at least since 2018, when then-OKEx CEO Chris Lee defected to Huobi to become vice president of global business development.      OKEx CEO Jay Hao, in a company update in March, called Huobi “our doppelgänger,” insisted “imitation was the sincerest form of flattery” and said he “would like to think that Huobi was able to withstand this market volatility by following our footsteps.”      Last week, Hao told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat: “At OKEx, we seldom judge or compare our performance with our peers” because the competition is not easily “defined simply with data or certain metrics.”    Chinese crypto markets are big, lucrative and up for grabs    Experts on China’s often-murky cryptocurrency markets say the rivalry between the two exchanges likely stems from the fight for customers in the world’s second-largest economy.      “There’s a natural friction between OKEx and Huobi,” Matthew Graham, chief executive officer of Beijing-based crypto consultancy Sino Global Capital, told CoinDesk in an email. “While they have both pushed to enlarge their international footprints, they still prioritize their Chinese user base.”      China has been pushing to become a global leader in blockchain, in what some observers say could become a hotspot in an emerging cold war between the country and the U.S. for technological supremacy. Chinese banks are already testing a digital version of its national currency, the yuan, while American officials have said they’re merely studying a digital dollar.      Read more: More Than 95% of Crypto Futures Volume Is in Asia: Report      Under the current rules, Chinese exchanges can’t technically sell cryptocurrencies for yuan, and there has been a crackdown from authorities. But many residents in the country buy bitcoin (BTC) or dollar-linked stablecoins like tether (USDT) from over-the-counter brokers, then use those tokens for trading, according to an Aug. 20 report from Chainalysis. The report called the East Asia region the world’s biggest cryptocurrency market, accounting for 31% of all transactions in the past 12 months.      “By using tether as a fiat stand-in instead of, say, bitcoin, traders can lock in gains without off-ramping into fiat by simply converting other currencies into tether and leaving the tether in their wallet or exchange account,” Chainalysis wrote.      According to Graham, the friction between the two exchanges has only intensified as they fight to obtain a more favored position with the Chinese government.      On that count, Huobi might be one move ahead of OKEx: The Chinese branch of Huobi has joined the Blockchain-Based Service Network (BSN) Development Alliance, which aims to be one of the most influential infrastructure services providers in the country.      “Is there room for two crypto-focused exchanges at the table?” Graham said. “We aren’t certain. But if there’s only one position, that position is highly coveted by both OKEx and Huobi.”      Officially, Huobi doesn’t even acknowledge the Chinese cryptocurrency market exists: “There is not a market in China. That is not legal,” Sun said.      According to the website tracker, Huobi appears to be getting nearly a third of its website traffic from Chinese visitors, versus 14% for OKEx.      “We don't know the exact trading volume being done in China, unfortunately, but we can see bitcoin flow changes when the Chinese government announces something,” says Ki Young Ju, CEO of the Korean blockchain data tracker CryptQuant.      The regional turf war between Huobi and OKEx now serves as a backdrop in their competition for more futures-trading business.      “Huobi has managed to push new boundaries against other well-established exchanges when it comes to futures trading volume,” according to the company’s Aug. 14 report.      The exchange says it’s also beating OKEx on “market depth,” a gauge of how many buy and sell orders are waiting at any given price point.      Tom Wang, chief operating officer of Huobi Futures, told CoinDesk the company’s newly launched perpetual-swap product, which functions similar to futures but without expiry dates, also contributed to the second-quarter growth.      “Huobi’s perpetual swap’s 24-hour trading volume was at $5.37 billion, surpassing BitMEX’s $5.22 billion on May 12, 2020,” he said. “On this particular product, OKEx remains less competitive to us.”      Customers are seeing at least one benefit from the feud: more choices. Huobi announced in July it will launch bitcoin option trading in the third quarter, while OKEx said around the same time it has added three more expiration dates – daily, two-day and monthly – to its options-trading suite.      ""We appreciate a healthy competition,” Lennix Lai, director of financial markets at OKEx, told CoinDesk.      Dovey Wan, a partner at crypto asset investment fund Primitive Ventures, told CoinDesk in a Twitter direct message the squabble reminds her of the way Chinese tech giants vie for dominance in the domestic market.      “It’s like Alibaba and Tencent never fight Google and Facebook,” said Wan, who also serves as a member of CoinDesk's advisory board. “But they fight bitterly in China.”      UPDATE (Sept. 03, 2020, 13:00 UTC): Huobi is based in Seychelles, not Singapore.

42422071,nAPHWRwYo7WGMD8VryKRt4,1598865007,"DeFi Is a 'Complete Scam,' Says Controversial Entrepreneur Craig Wright","nChain Chief Scientist Craig Wright has delivered an obscenity-laden interview discussing decentralized finance (DeFi) and stablecoins, calling such projects a ""complete scam"" and ""illegal.""    Taking part in the virtual conference Reimagine 2020 published Saturday, the controversial figure told host Patrick MacLain that both DeFi schemes offering lending and borrowing, and stablecoins are ""illegal, unregistered and unlicensed.""  Creators of DeFi projects are ""con men ... criminal a**holes taking money, full stop,"" he told MacLain, adding an inflammatory take on oracle networks such as Chainlink.  ""'We’ve got a decentralized oracle.' Bulls**t you do! Sue me!” Wright said, making an obscene gesture to the camera.  ""Where is the damn backing?"" Wright asked, when discussing his thoughts on stablecoins.  Wright appeared to conflate all stablecoins – cryptocurrencies that aim to hold a stable value with backing from an asset such as the U.S. dollar or gold – with tether, a widely used USD-linked crypto that has never released a comprehensive audit of all its reserves.  Other stablecoins, such as USD coin, have done so.  When MacLain asked Wright for his view on decentralized exchanges, Wright claimed there was ""no such thing, full stop. ... [T]he exchanges are still run by a person.""  Wright has said he is the creator of the Bitcoin system, but has yet to provide convincing evidence to back up his claim and has faced allegations of fraud, which he contests vigorously through lawsuits.  ""I fight in court, I'm not a cowardly you-know-what who runs away,"" Wright told MacLain, taking a swipe at bitcoin investor Roger Ver, who he is suing for libel over such fraud accusations.  Wright is also fighting an ongoing court case involving the estate of his deceased former business partner, David Kleiman, that relates to the ownership of a 1.1 million ($12.8 billion) bitcoin fortune.  Wright's credibility as the supposed inventor of Bitcoin has suffered somewhat during the process, with a judge saying Wright has at times argued in bad faith, perjured himself and admitted false evidence.  In May, a message also alleging Wright is a fraud was cryptographically signed with over 100 Bitcoin addresses he has claimed to own in Kleiman case evidence.  Cryptography experts have described his subsequent claims about how bitcoin signing works as ""nonsense.""  Wright is a proponent of a bitcoin alternative cryptocurrency called bitcoin sv (for Satoshi's Vision).  He further took the chance to knock Bitcoin in his interview, saying that it ""isn't a decentralized network of every node running things.""  ""Your node doesn't help the network unless you're a miner,"" he claimed.

In a memorandum first reported by The Block, the IRS' Office of Chief Counsel published a response to a June 29 request for clarification from the tax agent's own Small Business/Self Employed Division.  The question centered around whether crypto earned by an individual for performing a microtask through a crowdsourcing or similar platform was a taxable income.  ""Yes,"" said Ronald Goldstein, IRS senior technician reviewer and memo author, ""the convertible virtual currency received is taxable as ordinary income.""  Goldstein added that cryptocurrency ""acts as a substitute for real currency"" and is therefore considered property for federal income tax purposes pertaining to section 61(a) of the IRS tax code.  An example of microtasking included a company offering to pay workers in bitcoin for processing data or reviewing images.  The value of crypto paid in exchange for microtasks are often small amounts that could be less than $1.  Other examples included downloading an app and leaving a positive review; downloading games and reaching particular milestones; completing online quizzes; or registering accounts with various online services.  According to the memo, these types of microtasks ""may provide individuals with rewards"" in the form of cryptocurrency and are thereby subject to the same regulations as regular money.  The guidance comes at a time when the tax agency has been in crackdown mode to end suspected crypto tax avoidance, seemingly contradicting the advice of its own watchdog.
