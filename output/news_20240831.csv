33041941,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638997,1725141607,Will MANA Hold The Line? Key Trendline Retest Could Lead To An Upsurge,"Decentraland (MANA) is at a critical juncture as it faces a key trendline retest that could determine its next major move. With the price hovering near a crucial support level, market watchers are keen to see whether MANA will hold the line and spark a bullish reversal. A successful defense of this trendline could trigger an upsurge, propelling the cryptocurrency to new highs. However, failure to hold could lead to increased volatility and uncertainty. All eyes are now on MANA’s ability to withstand the pressure and potentially set the stage for a significant breakout. This article aims to examine MANA’s critical trendline retest and its potential to ignite a bullish upsurge. We will explore the technical factors at play, assess key support and resistance levels, and consider the market sentiment driving this pivotal moment, providing traders and investors with insights into whether MANA is poised for a breakout or if a reversal is on the horizon. Market Sentiment: Are Bulls Ready To Take Charge? MANA’s price is currently trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the 4-hour chart, with a clear attempt to retest bearish territory. This price action indicates that bearish forces remain dominant in the market and could push the price further down toward the key trendline support level. Additionally, on the 4-hour chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has fallen below the 50% mark, now sitting at 33%. With the RSI hovering in the lower range, there is a heightened likelihood that the price may continue to lose ground, potentially moving toward a critical trendline retest. On the daily chart, MANA has been on a bearish trajectory, moving to retest the trendline after briefly trading above it and below the 100-day SMA, as evidenced by multiple bearish candlesticks. This downward movement reflects strong selling pressure and negative market sentiment, increasing the probability of the price reaching the trendline again. Finally, the 1-day RSI shows bearish pressure on MANA. The signal line has dropped below 50%, now resting at 45%, which signals intensifying selling pressure and a growing negative sentiment for the digital asset. Support Vs. Resistance: What’s Next For MANA? If MANA’s price reaches the bearish trendline and faces a rejection, it could set the stage for a significant upsurge, and $0.3103 could be the next resistance zone. A successful breakout above this resistance could signal further gains reinforcing the bullish trend aiming at the next resistance range at $0.3483 and other levels beyond. Should MANA fail to hold below the bearish trendline, it may experience consolidation or fall back to the $0.2559 support level. When the price breaks through this support, it could continue its downtrend, possibly targeting $0.2170 and other lower support levels. Currently, MANA is trading around $0.2792, marking a 3.7% decline. The cryptocurrency’s total market capitalization stands at $518 million, with a trading volume of $27 million in the last 24 hours. During this period, MANA’s market cap has decreased by 3.10%, and its trading volume has increased by 14.80%.

However, despite the notable rise in the crypto market, crypto analyst Alan Santana has warned of a potential crash that could send the market spiraling. This crash, if materialized, could see the crypto market lose around half of its market cap, something that could signal the beginning of another drawn out bear market. Why The Crypto Market Is In Trouble In the analysis shared on TradingView, crypto analyst Alan Santana outlines why he believes that the market could be in trouble. According to the crypto analyst, this is because the Bitcoin price is entering capitulation and this could affect the whole market. Santana refers to this as “Bitcoin’s 2024 Capitulation Event,” which poses a threat to the crypto market as a whole. Related Reading: Crypto Pundit Predicts Ethereum Price Rise To $3,000, But A Crash Could Happen First This comes because there has been a lot of withdrawal from the crypto market in recent times. This money is not only coming from Bitcoin, but a lot of money is being pulled out of altcoins as well, according to the analyst. The result of this constant withdrawal is the fact that the prices of altcoins have been unable to maintain their uptrend. “Many altcoins were looking good and remaining strong even while Bitcoin moved up, or down, but now everything is starting to slow down. This is the most revealing signal of all,” Alan Santana stated. Following this, the crypto analyst expects an “obvious” market crash for crypto. As for how low it could go, the chart shows an almost 50% plunge from its current level of around $2.2 trillion to as low as $1.26 trillion, putting it back at levels not seen since 2022. How Will Altcoins React To This Crash? Expanding further on the expected market crash, the crypto analyst revealed how he believes the altcoin market will react. In what he refers to as “The Cryptocurrency Apocalypse,” Santana points out that the market is currently experiencing the calm before the storm. He does not believe that the calls for another bull run are accurate and that the Bitcoin price could reach $100,000. Rather, he expects prices to start dropping and billions of dollars to be liquidated from traders “in a flash.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Eyes Massive Bull Surge As Metrics Turn Green However, following this crash, the crypt analyst forecasts that Bitcoin will hit a new low before rising again. In this case, Santana believes that the pioneer cryptocurrency will finally enjoy long-term growth. “The whole dynamic should play within 1-3 weeks,” he stated. “Interesting to watch is the biggest understatement in the history of life. It will be the most fascinating event ever, to see the upcoming crash and the worldwide reaction.

33034371,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638985,1725121824,ADA At A Crossroads: Approaching $0.3389 Support With Potential For A Deeper Decline,"Cardano (ADA) is approaching a crucial support level at $0.3389, a point that could determine its next major price movement. As the cryptocurrency nears this significant threshold, the question arises: will it hold firm, or will a break below signal a deeper decline? This pivotal moment could set the stage for significant shifts in ADA’s price trajectory. This article aims to analyze ADA’s current price dynamics as it approaches the $0.3389 support level. We will examine the significance of this support threshold and assess the potential impact of a breach on ADA’s price trajectory. By exploring technical indicators, recent market trends, and possible scenarios, we seek to provide a comprehensive outlook on whether ADA is poised for a deeper decline or if the support level will hold firm. As of the time of writing, ADA is trading around $0.3488, marking a 2.25% decline, with a market capitalization of over $12 billion and a trading volume exceeding $272 million. In the past 24 hours, ADA’s market cap has decreased by 2.23%, and its trading volume has dropped by 1.55% Decoding ADA Behavior: Key Insights From Current Trends On the 4-hour chart, ADA has dropped below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and is currently consolidating just above the $0.3389 mark. This positioning suggests a bearish trend, with the potential for further declines if the cryptocurrency breaks below this key support level. Additionally, on the 4-hour chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has slipped below the 50% mark, currently resting at 41%, highlighting a growing bearish momentum and suggesting that selling pressure could intensify. On the daily chart, ADA is exhibiting notable negative movement below the 100-day SMA, with multiple bearish candlesticks forming as it nears the $0.3389 mark. This bearish trend indicates strong selling pressure and negative market sentiment, raising the likelihood of a breakout below this key level. Finally, the 1-day RSI reveals that ADA remains under significant bearish pressure, with the indicator trending below 50%. Sitting at 40%, the falling signal line highlights sustained bearish dominance and increasing pessimism surrounding the cryptocurrency. Critical Juncture: Will ADA’s $0.3389 Support Hold Or Signal A Deeper Drop? If ADA maintains support at the $0.3389 support level, it could start to rise toward the $0.4233 resistance level. If the price successfully breaches this resistance, it may continue its rally toward the next resistance point at $0.5229 and possibly other levels beyond. However, should the $0.3389 mark fail to hold and the price break below this level, the cryptocurrency may continue to move downward toward the $0.2388 range. Once this level is breached, the crypto asset may experience more price drops toward other support marks below.

MSTR's market cap exceeds the value of its BTC holdings, raising concerns about the premium investors are paying. While it reports positive cash flows, these are tiny in comparison to the market cap. The company's strategy hinges on BTC's debatable role as investment asset, making MSTR only as attractive as a Hold. MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) is a long-lived tech company that has, in recent years, devoted its focus almost entirely to Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). This has earned it a place in crypto indexes and ETFs. I first came across it while analyzing Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF ( BITQ ), which I covered again recently, but I wanted to focus more on MSTR specifically. One of the few in that fund to report positive cash flows, it's worth looking at what it's doing right and if it's something that can be done reliably for the long term. Overall, I find it to be a C corporation that functions like a managed BTC fund, hoping to generate good returns through BTC accumulation and supported by cash flows from BTC-related services. Yet, the features of BTC make me wonder if this can reliably produce good, compounding returns to the long-term investors, and so I have only rated MSTR a Hold. Bitcoin Development Company Formed in 1989, MicroStrategy has a long history as a software developer, even being one of those notorious Dot Com stocks that saw a meteoric rise and crash during the bubble. Only for the last few years has it leveraged this background into a focus on BTC, and so I'll reference the operating results of that period. Income Statement (2023 Form 10K) Over the last three reporting years, MSTR has had around $500M in revenue from its various lines of software and related services, typically at attractive gross margins. Income Statement (2023 Form 10K) Seen above, their operating expenses have tended to push them into losses, but this largely owes to the impact of non-cash items. Cash Flow Statement (2023 Form 10K) When we look to the cash flows, operating cash flow has exceeded capex, producing a positive free cash flow in the basic sense. We should, however, note the significant outflow on purchases of BTC (""digital assets""). Cash Flow Statement (2023 Form 10K) As a ""Bitcoin development company,"" MicroStrategy aspires to be an accumulator of BTC and to be a seller of software and services that will support the development of its mainstream use. Q2 2024 Company Presentation Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK.A )/( BRK.B ) is a C-corp that uses its structure to invest in stocks, while also using the cash flows of its wholly owned businesses to support this capital allocation. One could say that valuing MSTR requires a similar approach to that of BRK: its value will depend on one's appraisal of both the operations and the portfolio. BRK's portfolio consists of many stocks, but MSTR's is simply BTC, so much of this will depend on the future of the cryptocurrency itself. BTC Portfolio Where BTC ETFs allow one to invest in BTC through a normal brokerage account, the disadvantage is in the friction created by their expense ratios that compete against BTC's appreciation over time. MSTR believes that it overcomes that disadvantage with the cash from its operations, as well as a calculated use of financing. Its main goal then is to accumulate BTC at a faster pace than it can dilute common shares. Q2 2024 Company Presentation They have developed an internal metric called BTC Yield to express this, the rate of change between total BTC holdings and fully diluted shares outstanding. A positive yield indicates that they should be creating value, and the yield has been consistently positive so far. Q2 2024 Company Presentation At the end of Q2, they reported ₿226.5K, with an average cost basis of about $36.8K per coin. As the price of BTC has declined slightly since this was reported, they likely have something around $14 billion in market value of their portfolio now. Review of Operations MSTR's software business isn't purely BTC-focused, and its provides AI-powered analytics to a variety of industries. Q2 2024 Form 10Q Revenues have recently been in a state of decline, as MicroStatregy is migrating more customers to its cloud platform, which monetizes on a subscription basis. The short-term impact therefore appears to be a reduction in revenue, with potential for higher cash flow in the long term as more customers convert to the cloud product. Q2 2024 Form 10Q Part of the impact is that operating cash flows (and thus free cash flow) are much lower for the business, year-over-year. Annualized, that comes to about $6M in FCF. Future Outlook In order to value this business, we need to sift through the different layers that affect it, such the operations, the portfolio, and then the capital structure. 2022 and 2023 Forms 10K One of my concerns with the software business is that the cost of revenues for the cloud subscriptions are much higher than those for product licenses they are largely replacing. In addition to the dip in revenue mentioned before, this seems to be the other main reason why operating cash flows are down from $93.8M in 2021 to an annualized amount of $6M currently. Stock-Based Compensation History (2022 and 2023 Forms 10K) Looking at the last three years, almost none of this can be attributed to stock-based compensation, and so it appears to be a genuinely more expensive product. As AI-powered data analytics have typically shown significant demand by enterprises that use them, it's curious why their subscription product isn't priced more aggressively to account for this. Author's calculation Even if we make positive assumptions, that free cash flow will enjoy at least single-digit growth over a decade (in spite of the decreased margins), a Discounted Cash Flow model (priced for a 10% discount rate to compare to the market) suggests the intrinsic value of the software business is about $84M. Ambitious growth assumptions that allow for FCF to return to 2021 levels, as if costs might decline/halt as the subscriptions scale out, still get that into the hundreds of millions. As the BTC portfolio has a market value of about $14B, while MSTR's market cap exceeds $25B, it's just clear that the business operations are barely a consideration here. MSTR's management of BTC is what counts. So why the $11B premium to the BTC holdings? Executive Chairman Michael Saylor explained his thoughts to analysts in the Q2 earnings call , stating: So, when you have an investment in bitcoin you're not thinking about holding it for a short period of time and flipping it. Now, when you think about holding something for 30 years, or 40 years, and if you have a vehicle like a closed-in fund that charges 250 basis points as a fee; that looks like a negative BTC Yield of 2.5%. We have experience with those sort of things, and we've seen they trade at a discount to net asset value. Closed-in funds with a long fee on an asset you're going to hold forever, they start to look like a multiple of the negative BTC Yield. Saylor therefore seems to agree with me that MSTR functions like a fund, arguing that the premium is pricing in the value of the BTC yield. Referring to Saylor's remark about treating BTC as an investment asset, it does bring something up that gives me pause: the conflicting view on what BTC should be for the long term. Is it an investment asset, or is it a digital currency? Q2 2024 Company Presentation The company believes that BTC's market cap, just over $1 trillion, has room to appreciate more, as global assets overall are valued at $900T. I'll note that three of the four largest slices (equities, bonds, and real estate) account for assets that actually produce earnings and cash flow, while also offering hard assets as additional value or collateral. BTC lacks either of these qualities. Gold, art, and cars/collectibles are also hard assets, and to varying degrees they actually have uses. This means that BTC competes most directly with fiat currency, the remaining $120T, as neither provide earnings or are anything unto themselves, merely currencies. I'll quote the shareholder letter within their 2023 Annual Report , which explains their views on the superiority of BTC: Now, many have focused more on the belief that Bitcoin is only valuable as a medium of exchange, and in that case, it’s very easy to say Bitcoin is slow and not a good medium of exchange like the dollar or the euro. However, if you look at all the wealth in the world today, only a small percentage of the world’s wealth is stored in immediately accessible mediums of exchange, such as cash or checking accounts, and those instruments don’t serve as good stores of value, particularly in inflationary times. Therefore, most wealth is actually in the form of some better store of value or useful capital, such as real property or stocks. When it comes to wealth preservation or capital appreciation then, this insight shifts the narrative away from medium of exchange to store of value and from digital currency to digital property. Because of its characteristics, we believe Bitcoin is a superior store of value, akin to digital gold or digital property, and just as records and CDs gave way to digital music, we believe gold and other traditional physical stores of value will give way to Bitcoin. Penned by Saylor, he explicitly disagrees that BTC will function in the way that it is intended to function, as a currency. He thinks it's better as a store of value. Part of the problem here is that so many people who hold BTC do so on the belief that will displace other fiat currencies. If that doesn't happen, how does that affect demand and thus the price? My guess is that it would not be positively. This is the problem with an asset like BTC. Its popularity is built on the simultaneous but often contradictory views that it can function as a currency in the short-term and as a store of value in the long-term, even though it lacks the traits of either. Is this a prediction that BTC will fail and, with it, shares of MSTR? No, but it does make me question why I'd buy today at almost an 80% premium to the market value of the BTC holdings or settle for anything less than a GAAP undervaluation. Q2 2024 Company Presentation Finally, let's consider the debt on hand and how that plays into things. Nearly all of this is convertible debt, with only the $500M due 2028 of the $3.7B in LT debt on its balance sheet being non-convertible. As the company has no problem with issuing equity, I suspect that any debt that isn't converted will simply be repaid with more ATM equity offerings, assuming they can't refinance. Thus, my main point is that I want to consider full potential dilution. Q2 2024 Company Presentation Across its Class A shares, Class B shares, and convertible notes, that comes to 22,166,000 ""assumed diluted shares"" as of Q2. Of course, if we remember the stock split they also announced , then we need to multiply that by 10. While MSTR currently trades for about $132 on the market, a fair value for its $14B of BTC would be about $63 per share (if we assume MSTR's strategy cannot close that gap). Conclusion MSTR's market cap over $25B is well above the value of the BTC holdings, likely around the $14B level at current prices. Their operations only generate a few million in free cash flow each year and are insufficient to plug this value gap. MSTR's premium to its BTC holdings therefore requires confidence that its price will increase over the long-term and at a high enough rate to make that premium attractive, along with belief that MSTR can continue to generate a positive BTC yield. In my view, the company fails to establish why BTC will reliably perform as other assets do. Stocks and bonds have earnings that can compound. Gold and art physically exist and at least have some utility. Despite a boom of AI and the tech to create software that large customers can utilize, this is the path MicroStrategy has chosen. Perhaps BTC (and MSTR with it) will continue to appreciate for some time. Yet, there's nothing fundamental to the business to require this. In my opinion, only a discount to holdings makes sense as an alternative to buying BTC directly. With all these uncertainties, I consider this stock a Hold at best.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4718353-microstrategy-a-vote-on-the-uncertain-future-of-btc-mstr-stock?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/33034389.jpeg

33032949,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24071,1725117050,NFTs: Đồ sưu tầm hay Chứng khoán?,"Ủy ban Chứng khoán và Giao dịch Hoa Kỳ (SEC) đã gửi một Thông báo Wells tới OpenSea, sàn giao dịch NFT hàng đầu, báo hiệu một vụ kiện tiềm năng dựa trên việc phân loại NFT nhất định là chứng khoán. Động thái này của cơ quan quản lý đại diện cho một giai đoạn mới trong việc SEC xem xét thị trường NFT và làm dấy lên lo ngại về tương lai của nghệ thuật kỹ thuật số và đồ sưu tầm. Bằng cách nhắm mục tiêu vào OpenSea, SEC có thể tạo ra một tiền lệ không chỉ ảnh hưởng đến các nền tảng NFT mà còn cả những người sáng tạo và nhà phát triển, trong lĩnh vực tài sản kỹ thuật số đang phát triển nhanh chóng này. SEC Đánh Mục Tiêu Ngành NFT: Chuyện gì đang xảy ra? Ủy ban Chứng khoán và Giao dịch Hoa Kỳ (SEC) vừa gửi cho OpenSea một “Wells Notice” – dấu hiệu cho thấy SEC đang xem xét việc phân loại một số NFT trên nền tảng này là chứng khoán. Động thái này có thể tạo ra những thách thức pháp lý lớn cho OpenSea và ảnh hưởng sâu rộng đến toàn bộ thị trường NFT. NFT là gì mà “to chuyện” thế nhỉ? NFT, hay Non-Fungible Token, là một loại tài sản kỹ thuật số duy nhất, không thể thay thế được. Chúng có thể đại diện cho bất cứ thứ gì từ tác phẩm nghệ thuật kỹ thuật số, vật phẩm sưu tầm, cho đến các vật phẩm trong trò chơi hay thậm chí là vé sự kiện. Nếu SEC tiến hành thực thi luật chứng khoán với NFT, điều này có thể tạo tiền lệ ảnh hưởng không chỉ đến các nền tảng NFT mà còn cả những người sáng tạo, nghệ sĩ và nhà phát triển dựa vào các nền tảng này để phân phối tác phẩm của họ. OpenSea “toang” rồi à? OpenSea, một trong những thị trường NFT lớn nhất, đóng vai trò trung tâm cho các nghệ sĩ kỹ thuật số và nhà sưu tập. Hành động tiềm tàng của SEC có thể gây khó khăn cho ngành công nghiệp bằng cách áp đặt gánh nặng pháp lý lên những người sáng tạo, những người có thể thiếu nguồn lực để tuân thủ các luật chứng khoán phức tạp. Việc áp dụng rộng rãi luật chứng khoán đối với NFT có thể khiến các nghệ sĩ không còn muốn khám phá các công nghệ và phương tiện mới. Điều này đặc biệt đáng lo ngại trong một lĩnh vực mà nghệ thuật kỹ thuật số và vật phẩm sưu tầm đã cung cấp những con đường mới cho sự thể hiện sáng tạo và trao quyền kinh tế. Wells Notice là gì và nó có ý nghĩa như thế nào? Wells Notice là một thông báo chính thức từ SEC cho biết rằng cơ quan này đang xem xét việc thực hiện các biện pháp cưỡng chế đối với một công ty hoặc cá nhân vì các vi phạm tiềm ẩn đối với luật chứng khoán. Nó nêu rõ các cáo buộc đang được xem xét và cho người nhận cơ hội phản hồi trước khi bất kỳ cáo buộc chính thức nào được đệ trình. Đối với một công ty như OpenSea, hoạt động trong thị trường NFT mới nổi, hậu quả của Wells Notice có thể rất đáng kể. Nếu SEC tiến hành thực thi, nó có thể dẫn đến hành động pháp lý không chỉ ảnh hưởng đến OpenSea mà còn tạo ra một tiền lệ rộng lớn hơn về cách NFT được quản lý. Điều này có khả năng phân loại lại nhiều NFT thành chứng khoán, khiến chúng phải tuân theo các yêu cầu pháp lý nghiêm ngặt, có thể cản trở sự đổi mới, ảnh hưởng đến động lực thị trường và tạo ra những thách thức pháp lý tốn kém cũng như rào cản pháp lý cho các nghệ sĩ, người sáng tạo và nền tảng hoạt động trong không gian NFT. Liệu vật phẩm sưu tầm có đột nhiên trở thành chứng khoán được quản lý chỉ vì chúng ở dạng kỹ thuật số? Vật phẩm sưu tầm kỹ thuật số có nên bị coi là chứng khoán chỉ vì chúng có thể được mua bán và đầu tư? Theo truyền thống, chúng được xem như hàng hóa, không phải chứng khoán. Tuy nhiên, với sự phát triển của NFT, các cơ quan quản lý đang xem xét lại điều này. Việc áp dụng luật chứng khoán cho chúng có thể gây ra nhiều thách thức pháp lý, ảnh hưởng tiêu cực đến thị trường và hạn chế sự sáng tạo. Nhiều người cho rằng cần có cách tiếp cận linh hoạt hơn, phân biệt giữa sản phẩm đầu tư và vật phẩm sưu tầm, dù là kỹ thuật số hay vật lý. Tóm lại: SEC đang nhắm vào thị trường NFT, và điều này có thể thay đổi hoàn toàn cuộc chơi. Quyết định của họ sẽ ảnh hưởng đến không chỉ các nền tảng lớn như OpenSea mà còn cả những người sáng tạo và nghệ sĩ nhỏ lẻ. Tương lai của NFT vẫn còn là ẩn số và chúng ta cần theo dõi sát sao diễn biến này.

33031685,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638949,1725114650,Bitcoin Hash Price Hits New Low — Is It Time To Buy?,"The price of Bitcoin failed to capitalize on its recent momentum over the past week, losing its hold above $60,000 yet again in August. As of this writing, the premier cryptocurrency is valued at $59,131, with no significant price change in the past day. Interestingly, the Bitcoin price appears to be nearing a bottom and gearing for a rebound, according to the latest on-chain data. Is Bitcoin Price Resuming Its Bull Run? A pseudonymous analyst on CryptoQuant’s Quicktake platform has revealed a “buying opportunity” for Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency in the market. This analysis is based on the changes in the Bitcoin hash price in the last few weeks and its potential implications on the BTC price. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Sudden Drop: Could This Be a Setup for a Massive Rally? Analyst Weighs In The hash price measures the daily revenue generated by BTC miners per terahash per second (TH/s). This metric is calculated by dividing the total daily revenue of miners by the network hash rate. The hash price basically estimates miners’ profit based on the computational power they contribute to the network. The chart above demonstrates the relationship between the Bitcoin price and the hash price. “The highlighted sections in the chart (blue boxes) indicate periods where the Hash Price dropped to lower levels, corresponding to times when Bitcoin prices were also at or near their lowest points,” the analyst said about the chart. As of this writing, the Bitcoin hash price stands way below $0.1, the lowest level since 2023. Historically, periods of extremely low hash prices have coincided with Bitcoin price bottoms, with a price rebound often coming after. With the current hash price at an all-time low, it appears that Bitcoin’s price might be bottoming out and preparing for a comeback. BTC Market Back In Bear Phase? In a new post on X, CryptoQuant’s head of research Julio Moreno revealed that the Bitcoin market cycle indicator is back in the bear phase. As shown in the chart below, this indicator has been swinging from the bull to the bear phase in the past few weeks, mirroring the current inconsistencies in the market. Moreno also sounded a warning about the recent slump in BTC‘s value to below the $60,000 mark. According to the expert, if the price breaks $56,000 to the downside, the potential for an even more significant correction increases.

33028206,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638971,1725105610,"TIA Down 23% In A Week, As Investors Eye New On-Chain Projects","With the crypto market eyeing to end August on a sour note, the altcoin sector saw more pain in the short term after the broader market dipped in the past 24 hours. This led to altcoins like TIA facing significant losses on all timeframes. Related Reading: Market Slip Drags Injective Down 16% Despite Ongoing Developments According to CoinGecko, TIA saw 23% in losses since last week, becoming one of the biggest losers since the market’s correction phase began. Despite the token’s underperformance, August was a great month for on-chain growth for Celestia. The only question now is whether investors are considering these developments to prince-in TIA in the long term. OurNetwork Modular Ecosystem Review Reveals Quiet Build-Up On Celestia OurNetwork’s official X account posted about its recent overview of the Modular ecosystem which Celestia is a part of. It revealed several key developments that show the ecosystem has been gathering momentum since the start of August. JUST IN: Modularity 🧩 | OurNetwork #266 👥 Sector Update | @ayyyeandy 🟣 @CelestiaOrg | @ofernau 🌀 @OmniFDN | @chasedevens 🦦 @alt_layer | @maqstik ⚡ @conduitxyz | @forrestnorwood Link to read ⬇️ https://t.co/DyCnBHxLWi — OurNetwork 🔎 (@ournetwork__) August 30, 2024 According to OurNetwork’s official blog post, although the modular sector of crypto faced some resistance due to its chain fragmentation problem, developments on chain abstraction by over 80 teams from different protocols and chains led to better user experience on-chain. Celestia leads the entire sector by a wide margin. It shows that the platform secured 44% of the total market share of data on data availability providers. This shows Celestia as a major player in the Modular sector. The platform’s niche of providing EVM blockchains with the infrastructure to verify data without downloading entire blocks is the main reason for Celestia’s jump in market share. From May 29th until August 28th, Celestia has kept pace chasing Ethereum’s position in the data availability niche. Time will tell whether the platform will usurp Ethereum as the prime data availability layer for EVM blockchains, but investor confidence in Celestia might not be in the position for recovery of TIA. $4.6 Breakthrough Imminent But Rejection’s Still A Possibility As of writing, the token is on the path of breaking through the $4.6 ceiling in the short term despite the market sentiment still flashing bearish. With the majority of the market still trying to recover from the disastrous dip, TIA’s potential breakthrough might be rejected. Related Reading: Cosmos (ATOM) On Downward Spiral With 23% Losses As Market FUD Worsens The relative strength index (RSI) shows that there is a slight dip in bullish momentum, but a flip may occur in the coming days as market volatility slows down. TIA’s significant correlation with Bitcoin will also play a part in the coming rally. Once BTC returns to $60k in the long term, we might see a possible retest of $5 soon; that is if the market flips bullish which may occur later in early or mid-September.

33027548,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638965,1725103774,"Layer 1 Blockchain Kaia Goes Live On Mainnet, Launches Builder’s $1.2 M Program","The mainnet launch aims to propel Kaia into one of the largest Web 3 ecosystems in Asia, leveraging the users of its parent companies, Kakao and LINE messaging apps. Kaia, a Layer 1 blockchain, is on a trajectory to make waves in web3 as it announces its mainnet launch on August 29. Through this launch and its collaboration with LINE NEXT, Kaia is looking forward to driving widespread adoption of Web3 services by integrating blockchain technology into the most popular messaging platforms in Asia. Dr. Sam Seo, Chairman of the Kaia DLT Foundation, emphasized the importance of this launch, stating: “The much-anticipated launch of the Kaia mainnet heralds a new era for the mass consumer adoption of blockchain-based services. Kaia will bring web3 to the rest of the world, starting from Asia.” Being born out of a merger of two pioneering L1 chains – Klaytn and Finschia which were respectively developed by Kakao and LINE – Kaia is on a path to partner with companies that operate widely-used messaging apps in Asia. By doing so, the wide user base that has over 400 partners already onboard is presented with the powerful blockchain capabilities that tag along with incorporating Kaia. The Kaia mainnet is positioned to become the world’s fastest Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchain. This is owed to its one-second finality and ultra-low gas fees which bring along a high-performance infrastructure that is designed to support a wide range of applications which include decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, real-world assets (RWAs), and messenger-based services. Also, by integrating with major Asian messaging platforms, Kaia seeks to overcome the user experience and distribution challenges that have hindered the broader adoption of web3 technologies in recent times. Supporting Innovation with the Kaia Wave Builder Program A vital part of this integration is the NEXT WEB SDK, a software development kit moulded by LINE NEXT. As a package, it includes the Kaia Wallet SDK, Kaia Wallet Market API, and LINE LIFF API which provide developers with the necessary tools to create Line Mini Dapps. The DApps created within the ecosystem can be created in such a way that they can be launched directly within the LINE messenger, in turn offering users a smooth experience. Kaia also takes pride in having low transaction latency, account abstraction, and fee delegation features which developers can exploit to create seamless and end-to-end experiences. This can be done all while tapping into a potential audience of millions across Asia. To further accelerate the development of web3 solutions, Kaia and LINE NEXT have introduced the Kaia Wave builder support program. Through this initiative, up to $1.2 million will be made available to help in marketing, technology and business support to eligible development teams. In addition to having access to these resources, teams will also get to enjoy support for token generation events (TGE), liquidity assistance, and connections to venture capitalists. A Ready-Made Ecosystem for Web3 Innovation Kaia’s integration with KakaoTalk and LINE secures a substantial user base. With 96% of South Korean residents using KakaoTalk and LINE being a dominant participant in the messaging landscape in Japan, Taiwan, and Thailand, Kaia promises to offer unparalleled access to a massive audience that is eager to explore the possibilities of web3. Through this merger, existing projects like the DOSI digital commerce platform, which allows users to purchase memberships, access passes, concert tickets, and NFTs using crypto or fiat, are anticipated to make a move and migrate to the Kaia mainnet. On the plus side, Klaytn’s blockchain technology is already widely utilized in South Korea for consumer-facing applications such as loyalty programs and medical implant certificates. Therefore, by harnessing the combined strengths of KakaoTalk and LINE, Kaia is set to empower developers to create innovative decentralized applications that are easily accessible to millions of users. Youngsu Ko, CEO of LINE NEXT Inc., was keen to note: “The launch of the Kaia mainnet is an important momentum for the LINE NEXT business as well, and I think it has started an important first step toward expanding the Asian Web3 ecosystem. LINE NEXT will focus on bringing new experiences to users with the new Web3 platform and LINE Mini Dapps through Kaia Wave.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/all/layer-1-blockchain-kaia-goes-live-on-mainnet-launches-builders-1-2-m-program/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

33025862,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638967,1725094837,UNI Rebounds To $5.5 – Will Bullish Momentum Push It Higher?,"Uniswap (UNI) has made a promising rebound to the $5.5 mark, sparking renewed optimism among investors and traders. With fresh momentum building, all eyes are on whether UNI can capitalize on this upward shift and push toward the next resistance level at $6.7. As anticipation grows, the battle between buyers and sellers will determine if this rebound marks the start of a stronger rally or if the resistance ahead will prove too challenging. This article aims to analyze UNI’s recent rebound to the $5.5 mark and assess whether the current bullish momentum can drive the price higher. By examining key technical indicators, market sentiment, and potential resistance levels, it will provide a comprehensive outlook on UNI’s next possible moves and what traders should watch for in the days ahead. In the last 24 hours, UNI has been trading around $5.94, reflecting a 1.92% increase. The cryptocurrency’s market capitalization stands at approximately $3.5 billion, with a trading volume of over $77 million. While the market cap experienced a 1.92% rise during this period, trading volume has declined by 9.60%. Market Sentiment: Are Bulls Gaining The Upper Hand? On the 4-hour chart, following a successful rebound to $5.5, UNI’s price has continued to gain momentum, aiming for the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the $6.7 resistance level. The digital asset has maintained a steady upward trend, indicating that the bulls are gaining control and could push the price even higher. Also, the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) analysis reveals that the signal line has climbed to 50%, indicating rising buying pressure. This suggests that UNI may continue to experience upward movement as momentum builds. On the 1-day chart, despite trading below the 100-day SMA, UNI is showing promising bullish momentum after holding above the $5.5 level. The appearance of multiple bullish candlesticks indicates strong buying interest and positive market sentiment, suggesting that the price may be poised for an upward move. Finally, on the 1-day chart, the RSI signal line is moving toward the 50% level after briefly dropping to 37%. This rebound suggests that positive momentum is gaining strength, potentially driving the cryptocurrency higher. Future Prospects: What’s Next For UNI Movement? As UNI rebounds at $5.5, the future price movement will hinge on several key factors. If the upbeat momentum continues, the price of UNI will continue to move upward targeting the $6.7 resistance level. Should the price break and close above the $6.7 level, it may continue its rally toward the next resistance point at $8.7 and possibly other levels beyond. However, if Uniswap reverses direction at any of the previously mentioned resistance levels, it would begin to drop toward the direction of its previous support range at $5.5. When the price breaches this support level, it could signify a deeper bearish trend, leading to additional price declines toward other lower levels.

This price decline underscores the overall negative performance of the crypto market leader in the last month, with a recorded monthly price decline of 10.64%. Interestingly, amidst this downtrend, the asset’s historical price data indicates that the bears may retain market control in the coming weeks. Related Reading: How Will The US Upcoming Fed Rate Cut Impact Bitcoin? QCP Analysts Weigh In September Popular For Negative Returns, Analyst Says In an X post on Friday, renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez has nudged Bitcoin investors to brace up for what could be a “tough” period in September. Based on historical price data, Martinez notes that Bitcoin commonly records a cumulative negative performance in September as seen in eight of the last 11 years. Over this period, Bitcoin has experienced an average and median price loss of 4.78% and 5.58% in September, respectively. Therefore, investors could expect the premier cryptocurrency to trade as low as $55,618 to 56,105 in the next four weeks. Interestingly, this period of potential price loss could serve as an opportunity for massive BTC accumulation. According to Bitcoin monthly returns, the crypto market leader has previously produced significant price gains in Q4, with recording a cumulative positive performance in October of 9 of the last 11 years. Meanwhile, the month of November may be an investor favorite having recorded net gains of 42.95% (2020) and 53.48% (2017) in the past two bull cycles. Generally, November shows much potential for a significant price increase, with an average price gain of 46.81% since 2013. However, investors may want to exercise caution in December. While Bitcoin has previously recorded gains as high as 46.92% (2020) in December, there have also been significant losses to the tune of 34.81% (2013). Notably, in this last month of the year, the premier cryptocurrency has shown a dual performance to nearly the same extent, recording an average price gain of 5.45% and a median price loss of 3.59%. Related Reading: Analysts Say Now Is the Time to Re-Accumulate Bitcoin—Here’s Why Bitcoin Price Outlook At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $59,218 with a 0.84% decline in the last day. Meanwhile, the asset’s trading daily volume has recorded a 3.05% gain and is currently valued at $33.38 billion According to BTC’s daily chart, the crypto market leader is undergoing a price consolidation, a breakout from which could result in a rise to the $65,400 price zone. However, data from the relative strength index indicates that Bitcoin is far from its oversold zone and could be set for further losses. In such a case, investors could prepare for a potential fall to around $53,800.

Over the past three days, the price has struggled to break past the $2,600 mark, raising concerns among analysts and investors. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Freefalls 20% Following $600 Million ETH Liquidation This performance has led to disappointment, particularly when compared to Bitcoin’s stronger showing this year. Critical data from Farside Investors reveals decreasing interest in Ethereum ETFs, which has added to the cautious sentiment surrounding ETH. This decline in interest may indicate broader concerns about Ethereum’s future performance. As ETH continues to face resistance at the $2,600 level, the market remains uncertain about its ability to break higher. The next few days will be critical in determining whether Ethereum can regain its momentum or if it will continue to lag behind its peers. The market is closely watching these developments, making this a pivotal moment for ETH. Ethereum ETFs’ Underwhelming Performance The launch of Ethereum ETFs was anticipated with great excitement, but it quickly became a “sell the news” event. Data from Farside Investors reveals that Ethereum ETFs have flopped in performance since their debut. Both inflows and outflows have gone to virtually zero, reflecting a lack of sustained investor interest. This response contrasts sharply with the enthusiasm that preceded their launch. Moreover, Bloomberg data shared by Galaxy Research highlights that Ethereum ETFs are trading at significantly lower volumes compared to Bitcoin ETFs. This discrepancy is notable, particularly when considering the ETH/BTC trading volumes and market cap ratios on centralized exchanges (CEX). Despite Ethereum’s strong market presence, these ETFs are not capturing the same level of investor attention as their Bitcoin counterparts. The current data suggests that, under prevailing market conditions, investors are more inclined to favor Bitcoin or even explore alternatives like Solana over Ethereum. The lack of enthusiasm for Ethereum ETFs underscores the broader market sentiment, where Bitcoin continues to dominate, leaving Ethereum and its financial products trailing. This development raises questions about the future appeal of Ethereum ETFs and whether they can gain traction in an increasingly competitive market. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Funding Rate Signals A Decline: Investors Expect $130 ETH Price Action Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $2,522, reflecting a period of uncertainty as it remains below the $2,600 mark since last Tuesday. This price point is significant because $2,600 served as a strong support level throughout most of August. The fact that it has now turned into resistance suggests that ETH could be facing further declines in the near term. For bulls to regain control and steer the price upward, breaking past the $2,600 resistance is crucial. Should this level be breached, the next target would be the local high of $2,820, signaling a potential bullish reversal. However, if Ethereum fails to reclaim the $2,600 level, it could lead to a continuation of the current downward trend, with the next key support level around $2,310.

33012883,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638875,1725064207,How Will The US Upcoming Fed Rate Cut Impact Bitcoin? QCP Analysts Weigh In,"As the United States Federal rate cut is fast approaching, analysts at QCP Capital, a global digital asset trading firm and market maker has now shared their prediction on how this development could impact Bitcoin price. According to the analysts, the upcoming U.S. non-farm payroll report and Friday’s GDP data will play crucial roles in shaping Bitcoin market sentiment. Notably, these economic indicators are expected to offer greater clarity on whether the Federal Reserve will commence a rate-cutting cycle in its next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on September 18. Related Reading: Bitcoin Open Interest Is Shooting Up: Will Shorts Be Rekt This Time? Economic Data To Influence Bitcoin’s Market Movements The QCP analysts has revealed that the anticipation of these events has led to cautious positioning among market participants, therefore this signals a potential “subdued volatility” for Bitcoin in the near term. Scheduled for release by September 6, the United States non-farm payrolls report is one the major economic metric that could very well influence the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions. The previous report earlier this month showed a rise in the US unemployment rate from 4.1% to 4.3%, which triggered a noticeable plunge in the global financial market. Notably, this increase raised concerns that the Fed might be falling behind in its efforts to adjust rates accordingly. In addition to the payroll data, today’s upcoming US GDP report could also affect Bitcoin’s price performance, although QCP Capital analysts believe its impact on the cryptocurrency market may be limited. The analysts noted: Tonight’s US GDP report is likely to be a non-event for crypto, especially if it reinforces the ongoing narrative of a slowing US economy. Bitcoin Market Performance And Price Action Outlook Amid these upcoming economic developments, Bitcoin has returned to a bearish trend after briefly recovering to over $61,000 yesterday. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $58,285, marking a 4.3% decline in the past 24 hours. This drop has prompted various market analysts to offer their updated insights on the asset’s short-term prospects. For instance, Elja Boom, a well-known crypto analyst on X, commented on the ongoing consolidation, stating: No signs of breakout yet. Consolidation could happen till October before breakout. I’m confident of a breakout in Q4 but before that, there’ll be some more choppiness. Meanwhile, another analyst, known as ‘Titan of Crypto’ on X, provided a short-term update, highlighting a key resistance level. The analyst highlighted the $59,600 price mark as a major level for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Must Do This Now’, Says Crypto Analyst According to the analyst, should Bitcoin reclaim this price levels and breaks through the cloud twist, “the clouds would flip from resistance to support” and this might just result in a major rally to the upside for Bitcoin. #Bitcoin Short Term Update 💥 If #BTC reclaims $59,600 and breaks through the cloud twist, the clouds would flip from resistance to support.

42417319,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTY5Lp,1725064200,A U.S. Crypto Bill's 2024 Chances,"Sens. Chuck Schumer, Cynthia Lummis and Tim Scott think legislation addressing crypto could move through Congress this year – here's how.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  A long, long journey  The narrative  Earlier this month, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told the audience at a ""Crypto4Harris"" virtual event that he hoped to shepherd crypto legislation through Congress and have President Joe Biden sign the bill into law by the end of 2024. It was a bold promise, one that on first blush seems like a hard pledge to fulfill.  Why it matters  The crypto industry has been begging for issue-specific legislation in the U.S. for years, in the hopes that this legislation may create clear permissions for companies to develop and issue tokens, manage blockchain networks or otherwise operate free of the concern that regulators may come knocking. The closest Congress has gotten so far is the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, a House bill supported by Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.). With a limited number of working days left in the year, the chances for crypto legislation moving through the Senate are slim. So here's what could happen and the potential roadblocks.  Breaking it down  Last week at the SALT Wyoming Symposium, Sens. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Tim Scott (R-S.C.) laid out a hypothetical that would get crypto legislation passed. According to the lawmakers, the best path comes through the Senate Agriculture Committee, which would focus on commodities law. Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), the chair of the committee, has been working on legislation, though she has yet to introduce her bill.  If a bill is voted out of this committee, Lummis said, it would likely become a ""Christmas Tree bill,"" where lawmakers add on other amendments and provisions, which could include, for example, the SAFER Banking Bill, stablecoin provisions and more.  But any legislation will be a long shot for a variety of reasons, including the limited number of working days left in this year's legislative calendar.  ""It's surprising how few of those are left after the election,"" Lummis said at the SALT event. Moreover, at least some portion of that remaining time will likely be spent working on must-pass bills like the annual National Defense Authorization Act and budget legislation.  It is entirely possible that a crypto provision may be folded into one of these bills, as one legislative staffer told me after Schumer's remarks, a thought Scott also shared on stage in Wyoming.  ""You have an opportunity to get a lot accomplished in a little bit of time because the motivation and the incentives are there,"" he said.  The potentially bigger issue is whether any crypto provisions will receive enough support to a) see a bill introduced in the Senate; b) get passed out of committee; and c) pass through the Senate, either as a standalone bill solely focused on crypto issues, as part of a larger financial services-focused bill or within the must-pass pieces of legislation.  While crypto is enjoying some bipartisan support in Congress, it's still not totally clear if it's a significant enough issue compared to everything else Congress has on its plate (for example, the fiscal year ends in a month and that's the first major issue lawmakers will likely have to vote on).  Still, everyone I've spoken to in the last few weeks has been cautiously optimistic about legislation moving – if not this year, then certainly next year. The fact that FIT21 did advance out of the House with bipartisan support is a major factor in this assessment, as is the fact that crypto issues are getting more attention from lawmakers than in years past.

Kennedy Jr. suspended his campaign in 10 states and endorsed Republican nominee Donald Trump. Kennedy supporters at the Minnesota State Fair told me he still has a pathway to victory through the states where he remains on the ballot, however, and at least three of the states where Kennedy is trying to withdraw his name have ruled that he will remain on the ballot.  Crypto Promoter and Failed Politician Michelle Bond Accused of Illegally Taking FTX Cash: Michelle Bond, who used to run the Association for Digital Assets Markets – an advocacy group – was indicted by prosecutors on charges of illegally handling and accepting campaign funds tied to former FTX executive Ryan Salame. She also allegedly filed inaccurate ethics documents about the source of campaign funds. The indictment dropped a day after Salame filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea or have his sentence vacated. Salame alleged that prosecutors had reneged on a deal wherein he would plead guilty and they would drop their investigation into Bond. The two have a young child.  SEC’s Case Against Kraken Will Proceed to Trial, California Judge Rules: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission brought a plausible case against Kraken, a federal judge ruled last Friday, in its suit alleging the crypto exchange was an unregistered broker, clearinghouse and exchange that facilitated unregistered securities transactions. The case now proceeds to the next stage.  ‘My Living Nightmare’: Detained Binance Exec’s Wife Begs for His Immediate Release: Former U.S. government official and current Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan has now been held in Nigerian custody for six months. Yuki Gambaryan, Tigran's wife, posted a video asking for his release, citing his deteriorating medical conditions and making calls to the U.S. and Nigerian governments. Binance CEO Richard Teng also told CoinDesk the company is working to secure Tigran's release. Tigran's trial on money laundering charges, which had been paused after the judge overseeing his case went on summer vacation after the start of his trial, is set to resume on Sept. 2.  Telegram CEO Pavel Durov Indicted on 'Complicity,' Refusal to Communicate Charges in French Court: Pavel Durov was arrested last weekend at a French airport and indicted on a host of charges. Some of the charges seem more straightforward than others – Durov is accused of not cooperating with French authorities in their investigations into the proliferation of money laundering, drug trafficking and child exploitation material on Telegram. Other charges, like Durov allegedly using encryption without embedding controls, have alarmed free speech, crypto and digital technology advocates.  This week  This week  Last week of August, everyone's still out. But hearings will resume next month so stay tuned.   Elsewhere:  (The Air Current) This is a bit of a wonky story. Newark Liberty International Airport used to be part of the air traffic control network that also controlled the rest of the broader New York City area. The Federal Aviation Administration is now moving control of the Newark airspace to a facility in the Philadelphia area. The upshot is this will theoretically alleviate some of the staffing issues Newark's had with air traffic controllers, which should in turn reduce some flight delays.
