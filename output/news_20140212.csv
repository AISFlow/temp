42376881,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6fy13,1392243825,Venture Capital Firms Still Bullish on Bitcoin Despite Risks,"As 2013 drew to a close, investment in the bitcoin ecosystem began to gain serious momentum, with Circle and Coinbase reaping multimillion-dollar funding rounds that drove total venture capital (VC) funding in the space past $80m.  Since then, momentum has undoubtedly slowed. Yet, new releases show that, behind the scenes, VC interest in bitcoin remains high.  VC firms such as Argentina-based Quasar Ventures and Denmark-based Sunstone Capital have both released new presentations that, while focused on explaining the basics of virtual currencies, suggest VCs are looking seriously at bitcoin investments, and are in the midst of considering where investment can best be applied.  Demian Brener  , senior business analyst at Quasar Ventures, which develops startups in-house and whose portfolio includes Restorando.com, explained his firm's interest in bitcoin:  ""The railroads of a new economy are being built right now, so we are excited to build the next big bitcoin companies and lead the transition to early adopters and beyond.""  If Quasar Ventures was bullish about bitcoin, Sunstone Capital's presentation provided potential evidence as to why. It suggested that the price of 1 BTC could eventually be worth $34,000 should bitcoin grow to account for even 1% of the global money supply. This estimate joins other notably optimistic estimates from Wedbush Securities, which forecasted bitcoin's future value to be nearly $100,000. Venture capitalist Chris Dixon has also offered similar price projections.  Sunstone associate Yacine Ghalim  further explained the reason for his company's interest in bitcoin:  ""Aside from being a groundbreaking technological innovation, bitcoin has the potential to become a financial, societal and even a political innovation all at once.""  Crossing the chasm  Of course, achieving these estimates will require VC firms like Quasar and Sunstone to further build the ecosystem and its available services through smart investments.  As Ghalim noted in his slideshow, the majority of investment - nearly $60m - has thus far been awarded to exchanges and wallets. As such, other surrounding services necessary for mainstream adoption - such as payment processing - have still yet to become the focal point of new capital.  Brener's presentation addressed more directly the implications of this observation, namely the gap between bitcoin's potential and its ability to appeal to consumers in the general market.  He acknowledged that such complementary services are needed to push the ecosystem from a phase defined by the presence of innovators, to one where complete solutions are available for early adopters who will be able to use the technology to ""solve particular problems"".  The next wave of investments  Brener suggests that many of the ""first opportunities"" for bitcoin investors have already been addressed by companies such as BitPay and Coinbase, but that there is as-yet-untapped potential for bitcoin loan and deposit companies that he says could be ""significant in the short term"".  Though, he adds that the solutions being developed by major US firms may not be one-size-fits-all, and that certain markets, like Latin America for example, could evolve to necessitate unique versions of current solution providers.  Ghalim was more certain that the position of these current market leaders is not guaranteed, stating that he doesn't see any vertical as safe from disruption:  ""Because of the important network effects, first-mover advantage could be more relevant than in other verticals. However, this is often overrated, and we don't think any bitcoin startup has acquired critical mass yet.""  Brener also labeled home seller, merchant services, micropayment and remittance markets as those that will necessitate the presence of reliable parties that serve the market like BitPay and Coinbase, suggesting that action could develop in these markets soon as these players become more established.  Long-term innovation  Perhaps most surprisingly, Brener suggests that investors aren't considering bitcoin companies alone, or even those using just the existing technology. Brener cited the Ethereum project as an example of a development that may not yield short-term investor dividends, but that has serious long-term implications.  For now, however, Brener said Quasar is looking for entrepreneurs that can help it become more active in the space. Said Brener:  ""We have already performed a deep analysis and identified some big opportunities, so we are now eager to find top-notch entrepreneurs to become partners and build them together.""  Likewise, Ghalim noted that his company is looking for entrepreneurs to back, and that these individuals come before the capability of any technology. He cited Europe as an area where ideas are flourishing and stated that his firm is following developments in the space ""closely"".  Obstacles  Of course, while promising, there remains ""major concern"" among VCs regarding the potential for regulation that could stifle innovation or otherwise restrict the bitcoin space in key markets.  ""Many investments could be delayed until regulations come out, which will take at least 12 more months, meaning that the bitcoin area could grow aggressively in 2015 and beyond,"" Brener cautioned.  Ghalim suggested that the ""systematic risk"" posed by mining conglomerates is also a concern.  ""While the protocol was originally designed to decentralise trust, this reintroduces a trust issue,"" he said.  Still, Brener explains that there will likely be a lag between investment and its impact on bitcoin users. He said that the short-term opportunities it is considering would not roll out for the next two to three years.

42376889,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6fyEt,1392235610,Get Bitcoin for Your Old Electronics with Glyde,"Glyde  , an eBay-like startup that lets users sell used electronics via its online marketplace, has now made bitcoin available as a payment option.  “The way we can help introduce people to bitcoin makes a lot of sense and is very exciting,” Drew Lieberman, Glyde's CEO, said in an interview with CoinDesk.  He added:  “We want to play a part in helping to spread the word, to evangelize, and let people know about bitcoin.”  Old items for new currency  Taking an existing concept that people are already familiar with – thanks to sites like eBay – and adapting it to the world of cryptocurrency makes sense as a simple first step into bitcoin ownership.  “I think we will have a portion of our current customer base that is familiar with bitcoin. This is a great opportunity for them to say, ‘Yeah, now here’s a tangible way I can get bitcoin’,"" Lieberman said.  “They don’t have to dip into their pocket and pay to get bitcoin.”  Bitcoin seems like a natural progression for the company, offering a new and innovative type of reimbursement option, according to Lieberman. “That’s consistent with the Glyde DNA – trying to streamline transactions and streamline commerce,” he said.  Many of Glyde’s customers will have sunk costs associated with their now-unwanted devices. If the bitcoin exchanged for the electronics eventually goes up in value, this could be a way to recoup some of that lost expenditure, as well as an easy way to own a few BTC.  “We’re providing them a way to get bitcoin, and we think that bitcoin has great potential ... it’s removing friction and barriers in the way that people conduct commerce,” said Lieberman.  Implementing bitcoin payments  Glyde is using Coinbase as the mechanism via which the site’s sellers are paid bitcoin. That’s different than the regular clientele for Coinbase, which is usually merchant customers accepting bitcoin as a payment method – that is, with Glyde transactions, the bitcoin is coming out of, not going into, the Coinbase system.  Lieberman told CoinDesk this means Glyde will be paying Coinbase commissions to translate fiat money into bitcoin, but that it will be worth it:  “We thought Coinbase was a substantial player, but also this makes it as easy as possible for users to move into the bitcoin ecosystem.”  When explaining the technical implementation, Lieberman said providing bitcoin payments via Coinbase to the Glyde platform was “not particularly problematic”.  A little background  Glyde, which calls itself a “peer-to-peer e-commerce marketplace”, was formed in 2006, while the beta version of its website was launched at the end of 2009.  Given that Glyde works in a similar manner to eBay’s ‘Buy It Now’ functionality, it is perhaps not surprising that the site has employed a number of former eBay veterans – including Lieberman, who once worked at eBay Motors.  Yet while eBay has primarily targeted auction-style sales for a multitude of items, Glyde’s strategy has been to focus on matching buyers and sellers of higher-end products.  Lieberman said the site's biggest sellers are smartphones and tablets.  Glyde, which is based in the Silicon Valley epicenter of Palo Alto, has received a generous amount of venture capital funding. According to CrunchBase, it has garnered a total of $27m in two rounds, which included investors such as Charles River Ventures and RPM Ventures.  The company has already carried out 500,000 transactions, worth $20m during its existence, according to Lieberman.  How it works  The Glyde marketplace is very simple to use. Firstly, an item is listed by answering questions that include the exact specifications of the device. Glyde then displays a recommended price for the item – although sellers do have the opportunity to set their own. When this process is completed, the device is posted on the site.  When a buyer opts to purchase an item, the seller will be sent a notification and shortly afterwards will receive a packaging box from Glyde – of the correct size and complete with the buyer’s shipping information – in the US Postal Service mail.  To mitigate any sort of security issues that could occur by passing on used devices – potentially packed with sensitive personal or business information – instructions on how to securely wipe the devices clean are also sent to the seller.  Once the item is received, the buyer then has 48 hours to decide whether the item is satisfactory, and the funds – which are now, of course, payable in bitcoin – are then released to the seller.  So, rather than leaving those ageing devices to slowly lose all their value in your desk drawer, Glyde could be a convenient way to find them a new home – and make a little bitcoin in the process.

42376870,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6fxsF,1392230062,MIT Club Hosts Largest-Ever Student Bitcoin Event,"On 11th February, more than 200 students crammed into a 125-person lecture hall at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to listen to entrepreneur Jeremy Allaire speak about bitcoin.  It was standing room only as the Circle founder and CEO informed the crowd of his background, his company and his passion for the fledgling industry for nearly 90 minutes.  Although the MIT Bitcoin Club was only officially recognized by the university on 1st January, it is already one of the largest student-run cryptocurrency groups in the country.  Full circle  Dan Elitzer, the club's president, was stunned by demand for the group's first event, in which nearly 300 students ultimately registered. Elitzer had initially booked a room for 60, but after selling out in a matter of hours, he and his team scrambled to find a larger venue.  Even after reserving the largest available room on campus, the club was forced to turn away dozens of disappointed students after every seat, stair and standing room area became occupied nearly 30 minutes before Allaire began his presentation:    ""This is our first event, and we are blown away by the amazing response.      The idea to bring in Jeremy as our first speaker came up several weeks ago during a planning session. While we thought it might be a big ask to have him present on such short notice, it only took a five-minute conversation to get him excited to visit.""    Enthusiasts vs skeptics  An informal poll of the audience revealed nearly 20 students who said they were actively working on bitcoin-related projects, and an even split between students who considered themselves enthusiasts and skeptics.  Several attendees credited Allaire with piquing their interest in the event. One computer science undergraduate said:  ""I'm not sure that I believe the hype around bitcoin just yet, but Mr Allaire is a tech pioneer and has been the CEO of a successful public company. I wanted to hear his point of view and learn more.""  Indeed, all attendees had a chance to learn about the broader bitcoin ecosystem as Allaire fielded a wide range of questions regarding bitcoin's regulatory environment, competitive threats and price volatility.  He also spoke at length about the potential for distributed public ledgers to spawn innovations other than currency, such as decentralized asset exchanges.  Future plans  While the Circle team were characteristically tight-lipped about their product plans, Allaire did say that his company intends to derive revenues from both consumer wallet services and merchant tools, and suggested that its revenue model will be similar to that of San Francisco-based wallet provider Coinbase.  When asked how the company would differentiate from Coinbase, Circle's co-founder Sean Neville simply said, ""The devil is in the details.""  Josh Hawkins, a VP of marketing at Circle, said he was excited to have had the opportunity to sponsor the event. Hawkins stated that his team's investment in campus evangelism was motivated by both a need to support and educate the broader bitcoin community, and an interest in recruiting talent from top engineering schools like MIT and Harvard.  Allaire agreed. ""Everyone always talks about Stanford and Silicon Valley,"" he said. ""But there's no reason that MIT and Boston can't lead the charge for bitcoin.""  They sure are off to a good start.  Ryan Galt is a blogger, entrepreneur and freelance opinion writer for CoinDesk. His opinions do not necessarily reflect CoinDesk’s.

42376875,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6fxzn,1392224546,Overstock to Launch New Rewards Scheme for Bitcoin Buyers,"Online outlet store Overstock.com is to launch a special rewards program that will give bitcoin buyers 1% back in the form of Club O dollars, the company’s in-house rewards points.      Speaking to CoinDesk, Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne said the scheme is expected to debut in approximately four weeks, although he did not commit to a definitive timeline.      The program will not provide an instant discount on orders, but will instead give 1% of the total purchase value back to buyers to be applied to future purchases. Byrne did not provide further details of how the program would work, or whether it will be able to be used in conjunction with other company rewards schemes.      The announcement comes as Overstock nears a total of $1m in sales paid for in bitcoin. Overstock began accepting bitcoin on 9th January – garnering $130,000 in total first-day spending.      Byrne declined to provide hard figures for Overstock’s current sales total, citing legal reasons, but did estimate that it will likely pass the $1m mark by this weekend at its current bitcoin sales rate.    Gender shift    Byrne said he continues to be surprised by number of purchases bitcoin users are making on the site. He indicated that bitcoin buyers are 80-85% male, whereas the average customer base generally is 60% female. The figures suggest bitcoin has opened up a new audience for the company.      Addressing the findings, Byrne said:      “We expected a move to computers, electronics and the kinds of things that the geeks who know about bitcoin would be likely to come and buy. Turns out there’s been very little shift like that.”              Instead, the top purchases via bitcoin to date have been furniture, desks and clothing – items that are not as accessible to bitcoin users through other merchants.    Tax showdown looms    Overstock’s recent decision to keep some bitcoin on its balance sheets could also find the company playing the role of newsmaker once again. Byrne suggested that should Overstock be holding bitcoins at the time of its upcoming first-quarter fiscal reporting, it will likely be required to report this action to the tax authorities.      “That’s an issue that the sec and the accounting wizards have not opined yet, so we could be the test case.”              Byrne indicated that he has already been contacted by several outside accounting firms that have voiced an interest in being part of this process. The agencies, he said, are interested in participating because it could set a precedent for how publicly traded bitcoin merchants will need to disclose such holdings.    Zombie-proof currency    In regards to his own personal bitcoin holdings in light of recent price volatility, Byrne said he remains unconcerned.      Citing the work of John Maynard Keynes, he spoke at length about the gap that exists between total wealth and the amount “sucked out of society by the financial system”. Bitcoin, he said, is a hedge against this gap.    “For me, bitcoin is what I want to have if the zombies walk the earth ... I don't really care about day-to-day fluctuations at all.”    On his recent fourth quarter company conference call, Byrne revealed that he invested “several million dollars” into bitcoin, an amount he now says is 1% of his net worth.

42376877,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6fy2J,1392217976,India's Government Claims the RBI is Examining Virtual Currencies,"The Indian government has claimed that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is examining the legal and security ramifications of virtual currencies.  The Hindu reported that Indian Finance Minister P Chidambaram made the following statement to the Rajya Sabha, India’s Upper House of Parliament:  “The RBI is presently examining the issues associated with the usage, holding and trading of virtual currencies, including bitcoins, under the extant legal and regulatory framework of the country, including foreign exchange and payment systems laws and regulations.”  Last December, the RBI issued an advisory cautioning Indians against the volatility of all virtual currencies. A bitcoin fan filed a claim pressing the RBI for clarification on this advisory, which alluded to the legitimacy of bitcoin.  Mr Na “Naavi” Vijayashankar is the lawyer representing that case. He claimed the latest statement from Chidambaram is quite neutral:  “I don’t see anything different except now we can say that the matter is under the attention of the biggest monetary authority in India, which is the Finance Minister.”  He added: “Even though the Reserve Bank of India is the regulatory authority, the political support has to come from the government. So at least now we can say all the persons who ought to be there in decision-making have been properly brought to the discussion table.”  The current term of the Indian Parliament is coming to an end with a general election this spring. Vijayashankar stressed that with this development, it is important to get the political support for the virtual currency agenda.  Meanwhile, Vijayshankar is planning on taking his case to the higher courts of judiciary by next week.

All that is required for full deployment at this stage is a regulators' approval, which the companies are hoping to receive in the coming weeks.  Banks and bitcoin  This news will come as a surprise to many. Not only have most major banks and money transfer businesses avoided involvement with bitcoin, some have been downright hostile by closing accounts with any discernible link to cryptocurrencies.  Official trading platforms and exchanges operated by big banks would give bitcoin mainstream legitimacy like no startup could, and they could easily out-compete smaller independent exchanges for customers.

Neither Gyft nor Dell need much of an introduction: Michael Dell’s empire remains one of the biggest PC makers in the market, while Gyft allows users to buy mobile gift cards that can be redeemed in several major merchants in the US.  Dell offers free five to seven day shipping and the usual Gyft discounts seem to apply. You can collect points by using Gyft cards and save up to 3% per purchase.  It doesn't sound like much, bit it adds up if you are planning a big purchase like a pricey 4K/UHD monitor. Of course, Dell still sells tons of relatively cheap gear, ranging from tablets and laptops to high-end desktop PCs, printers and some consumer electronics.  Gyft merchants  In addition to Dell, there are plenty of other merchants willing to accept Gyft cards. You can use them to shop at Amazon, Nike, Sears, GameStop, Target, Sears and many smaller e-commerce sites.  Needless to say, the vast majority of these merchants do not accept bitcoin, so gift cards are a practical way to spending your hard-earned coins indirectly.  So, why single out Dell? Most crypto fans also happen to be tech enthusiasts, and although Dell isn’t exactly an enthusiast brand, it does have an interesting range of products for connoisseurs, such as huge high-end monitors for designers and Alienware laptops and rigs for gamers.  There are a number of similar schemes around, which essentially allow consumers to shop for all sorts of things via gift cards bought for bitcoins.  While this method isn't as elegant or simple as a standard bitcoin transaction, it's an interesting alternative – moreover, in many cases it is the only alternative.

42376872,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6fxul,1392205425,Australian Writers Awarded 12 BTC in Bitcoin Essay Competition,"The winners of Australia's first bitcoin essay competition were announced this week, with 12 BTC in prizes awarded to three writers.  The writing contest, sponsored by Sydney-based exchange Bit Trade Australia, posed the question: 'Digital Currencies and the future: Will Bitcoin change the world?'.  The competition opened in November last year to Australian and New Zealand citizens with the intention to drive bitcoin and digital currency awareness.  Increase in value  The prize has increased in value considerably since the contest was announced. The 7 BTC first prize was worth around AU$1,000 when announced, but is now worth over AU$4,000, despite this week's price turmoil.  First prize went to Gareth Williams, a New Zealand native who lives in Sydney and works full time as a Java programmer.  ""I feel that Bitcoin, just like the Internet in the early 1990s, is a technology with enormous potential which is largely under-appreciated in the mainstream,"" he said.  ""I talk about it enthusiastically with anyone who will listen, but until I wrote my entry for this competition I'd never stopped to organize my thoughts on paper. I thoroughly enjoyed doing so, even though I never expected to win!""  Williams said he'll hang onto his 7 BTC prize for now. Having first come across bitcoin in 2011, he read Satoshi Nakamoto's 2008 white paper and thought: ""Wow, this is awesome!"" Like too many others he neglected to buy in at that stage, but was still prescient enough to acquire his first bitcoins in early 2013.  Since then, he's been reading bitcoin news and forums ""religiously"" but tends to 'lurk', rarely commenting. The essay contest was one of his first forays into writing about bitcoin – a move that suddenly looks promising.  Essays were judged by a panel of bitcoin experts including Bitcoin Foundation board member Elizabeth Ploshay, and University of Sydney professor and author Dick Bryan.  Promoting digital currency  ""The idea for the essay competition came out of our desire to raise awareness around the security of bitcoin versus traditional payment methods such as credit card transactions and cash,"" said Bit Trade Australia's Head of Marketing, Ronald Tucker.  ""As more businesses adopt Bitcoin in Australia we’re excited to share people’s thoughts and insight into how this will impact the Australian economy.""  Second and third place winners, Gitana PS and Gijutsu Kakumel, will receive 3 BTC and 2 BTC respectively. Bryan said:  ""We had a fantastic, diverse set of high quality essays. They address different aspects of bitcoin – from its emergence as an alternative money in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, to issues of the role of trust in financial markets, and the possibility of using the technological innovation within bitcoin to apply to other social possibilities, like on-line elections.""  ""Many also address the criticisms of bitcoin: whether it is merely a temporary device of speculation and its reputed connection to illegal trade. This is what makes explorations of bitcoin so important, and this essay competition so interesting.""  The winning essays will either be published on Bit Trade Australia's site soon, or the company will supply them on request.  Australia  Australia has only 22 million residents but is one of the world's top 20 economies. It is also one of the world's most economically liberal countries and one of its least corrupt, according to Transparency International. This all means a promising environment for bitcoin and a haven for bitcoin startups.  One of its major banks, the National Australia Bank, is apparently working with bitcoin businesses, and the local tax authority recently announced that it was looking for ways to include bitcoin in income declaration for the 2013-14 Financial Year.

42376882,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6fy7L,1392200265,Pop-up Pub in London's Tech City Accepts Bitcoin,"Hidden from the prying eyes of the public, a new basement pub has set up shop in the heart of Tech City, East London. And as befits London’s hub for digital innovation, you can pay for your beer with bitcoin.  Only the second pub in London to accept bitcoin – Hackney’s Pembury Tavern being the first – the Craft Beer Social Club is a roving pop-up pub stocked with British beer and hearty burgers.  The pop-up is run by Justina Cruickshank, who began the business after getting bored with the limited range of beers that you find in normal pubs. But beer isn’t the only thing on her mind: she wants bitcoin to be more widely adopted and has ideas about how to make it easier for businesses to use.  “The next thing for bitcoin is having an app that checks you into bitcoin businesses so you don't even have to send to a wallet or scan a QR code,” she says.  “The PayPal app works like this and it would be great to see something for bitcoin that had similar or better functionality.”  Craft Beer Social Club’s first outing was in Hackney in September 2013. The current location on Leonard Street, which runs until 8 March, is the first time Cruickshank has accepted bitcoinhttp://www.thecraftbeersocialclub.co.uk/#!bitcoin-and-paypal-payments-at-pop-up/c1fbl.  One of her biggest concerns was whether or not her usual customers would have any idea what bitcoin was and if it might put them off. She says that “misinformation” and “scaremongering” in the mainstream reporting of bitcoin has confused people about the digital currency.  “I'd just like the right information to be published in the mainstream [media] so people can understand what it is,” she says, comparing the current situation with online gambling, an industry she previously worked in and “which has similiar issues with acceptance, misinformation and regulatory challenges.”  She’s keen for the currency to go mainstream, partly for self-interested reasons: “For bitcoin to be more lucrative for me, the currency has to go mainstream.”  But she also wants more people to be able to reap the benefits of using bitcoin. Until now the bitcoin community has been too insular, she claims:  “There is a great active community of bitcoin supporters, but it's tiny […] It appears, to many, to be the preserve of the tech world. I don't see it like that, we should all have the opportunity to enjoy innovation.”  Prior to launching on 6 February, Justina offered a discount for advance purchases via bitcoin and PayPal. Around a third of the advance purchases were made with bitcoin. As well as using BitPay, she also allows people to pay directly to a wallet. Accepting bitcoin is “about offering more choice” she says.  Her advice to other businesses thinking about accepting bitcoin is to “forget the mainstream press” and read specialist bitcoin sites. More straightforwardly, she says, look up some businesses that already accept bitcoin: “give them a call, have a chat about their experiences.”  Maybe even sit down and have a beer with them.

42376879,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6fy4p,1392189968,What the 'Bitcoin Bug' Means: A Guide to Transaction Malleability,"This week, a term emerged that many bitcoiners won't have heard before: transaction malleability. Mt Gox cited it as a key reason for suspending withdrawals, and it was also mentioned as the basis for an exploit used in a massive attack against the bitcoin network this week. So, what is it, how does it work, and should we be worried? Here's what we know.  What is transaction malleability?  It's an attack that lets someone change the unique ID of a bitcoin transaction before it is confirmed on the bitcoin network. The change makes it possible for someone to pretend that a transaction didn't happen, if all the right conditions are in place.  Is it the same as double spending?  No. Double spending involves spending coins once, then creating a different transaction with those same coins before the first transaction is confirmed. The trick is then to get the fraudulent transaction confirmed on the bitcoin network first, so that the first transaction didn't happen. That effectively means that you get to spend them twice.  How does transaction malleability work?  To understand that, you have to know how a bitcoin transaction works.  When you send bitcoins to someone, you don't withdraw them from an account and send them whizzing along the wires. Bitcoins are never sent this way. Instead, a transaction is created on the bitcoin block chain.  The block chain acts like a giant general ledger for the whole of the bitcoin network. It keeps records of which bitcoin addresses sent funds to other bitcoin addresses, and when. This gives it a complete record of how many bitcoins can be attributed to which addresses on the network at any one time.  When a bitcoin transaction is made, it includes information such as the addresses that the bitcoins came from (the inputs), where they're going (the outputs), the amounts transferred, and which addresses sent those funds to the sender's address.  [post-quote]  Each transaction must be uniquely identified, so that it can be referenced in the block chain. That transaction ID (TX ID) is produced by taking the information in the transaction, and running it through a hash function.  Hashing is a mathematical procedure that takes different pieces of data and combines them to produce a shorter piece of information, known as a hash. One of the things that's included in a transaction hash is the user's digital signature, which proves that the transaction came from them. It's a way for them to digitally 'sign' the transaction.  One of the key qualities of a hashing function is that it is impossible to tell what the original information was simply by looking at the hash. It is also impossible to predict what the hash will be, based on the pieces of information that you start with. If any small detail changes in any of those pieces of data, it will change the hash in a completely unpredictable way.  This makes transaction IDs practically impossible to spoof. Each transaction should only have one possible hash. You can prove that a transaction is valid by simply running all of the pieces of information that made up that transaction through the hashing function, to check that you get the same hash.  At least, that's the idea. But here's where malleability comes in. The user's digital signatures used as part of the hash to 'sign' the transaction are meant to be in a certain format. That format wasn't always properly checked. This meant that a badly-formatted one could be introduced, and still accepted. Altering the signature in this way makes it possible to create different hashes for the same transaction.  That's not good. But, as it turns out, it's not world-endingly bad either. Here's why.  How can it cause problems?  One problem here centers around exchanges, which bitcoin users often used to buy and sell bitcoins. They send their fiat currency or their bitcoins to an exchange, where it sits in an account, so that it can be converted. At some point, they may wish to withdraw bitcoins from the account.  There are several potential scenarios. Here are a couple:  Malicious individual attacks  Let's say that Alice runs an exchange, and Eve has bitcoins sitting in that exchange. Eve decides to withdraw her coins, and asks Alice to send the bitcoins to her address. When Alice sends them, this automatically creates a transaction, which is transmitted for mining so that it can be included in the bitcoin block chain.  But Eve pretends that Alice never sent them. She uses the transaction malleability flaw to reproduce Alice's original transaction, tweaking the signature slightly to produce a different hash. She then retransmits that transaction, with the different ID.  There is a chance that Eve's transaction will be confirmed on the block chain first. If that happens, the network will assume that transaction is valid, and won't record Alice's. Eve can then complain to Alice that she didn't receive the coins. When Alice checks for her transaction ID in the block chain, she won't find it, and she might try to send more bitcoins, meaning that she'll be out of pocket.  Well-meaning accidents  If you are using custom software of your own to handle your bitcoins, it may generate malformed hashes by mistake. These hashes may then be 'fixed' by another, better-behaved wallet, which properly formats them. But that might change the TX ID. If your wallet is not designed to notice transactions with the same characteristics but a different ID, then it may end up with 'stuck' transactions that hang in limbo. Worse still, it might think that it still has those coins to spend.  Either way, it's a bookkeeping nightmare, if your software can't cope. Bitcoin core developer Gregory Maxwell muses about that possibility here.  Mass denial of service attacks  Someone could also cause wider problems for the bitcoin network by deliberately launching transaction malleability attacks on multiple exchanges at once, perhaps using software deliberately designed to create mutant transactions. This concerted attack is what appears to have happened this week, with multiple exchanges being hit.  The back end accounting systems for these exchanges may be able to cope with moderate numbers of mutant transactions, but if they are repeatedly bombarded with them, then it could cause them logistical problems for a while.  It could cause short-term problems for the market, too. Any uncertainty or doubt about market stability will naturally have an effect on market prices, especially with such an illiquid, volatile asset class.  Does this mean that there's a bug in bitcoin?  There have been several issues with technologies that the bitcoin network uses, that create malleability problems. One of them was originally in the reference client - this is the software produced by a core team of developers that most people draw on when building their own services. That issue was a failure to double-check signature data before passing it to another piece of software that the bitcoin reference client relied on.  According to an announcement from the Bitcoin Foundation this week, this latest malleability attack is relaying mutated versions of transactions which is ""exposing bugs in both the reference implementation and some exchange’s software,"" meaning that there are software flaws in different places in the bitcoin ecosystem that should be addressed.  The core developers have also told CoinDesk about two 'edge cases' in the reference client (those are flaws that would very rarely be invoked). These both focus on the wallet part of the software.  It turns out that there are quite a few other malleability issues, including some listed just this monthhttps://gist.github.com/sipa/8907691 by one of the core bitcoin developers in a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) - a document that requests some changes to bitcoin.  The core developers are being muted about exactly what the most troublesome issues are, because they don't want to give any more information to potential attackers.  How is it being fixed?  The community knew about the most often-discussed issue, which allowed for malformed signatures to be submitted, as long ago as 2011 (see this discussion). The problem here was that a key piece of software used by the bitcoin client didn't handle badly-formed signatures correctly. That wasn't the bitcoin core developers' fault, but what they failed to do was to get the bitcoin client to double-check that the signature was properly formed before they handed it over. That was remedied in the 0.8 version of the reference client.  Not all exchanges use the reference client to handle their bitcoin transactions, however. They may use custom versions, which do things slightly differently. So bitcoin developers, and wallet and exchange developers are all tinkering with their code to ensure that things run smoothly. For exchanges, that will involve making sure that exchanges handle mutant transactions gracefully, doing the right things when they see one.  The other fixes are more about processes. Things that make malleability more of a problem are a reliance on unconfirmed transactions, in which goods and services are transferred or provided before a transaction is confirmed in the block chain. So requiring transaction confirmation is always a good idea.  Similarly, having some manual verification of bitcoin withdrawals from exchanges can help to keep things in order at the back end.  So is the bitcoin world ending? Are we facing a cryptocalypse?  It's an irritation, but little more. There are bugs in most software products, but not all bugs are created equal. Some are critical, show-stopping errors, and some aren't. These aren't, and bitcoin is not broken. The core basics of bitcoin - the decentralized way in which lots of computers work together to make decisions about transactions - still work.  In our exchange example above, you'd hope that Alice would have detailed enough bookkeeping records that she would still be able to reconcile the bitcoins that she had sent. If she sent Eve, say, 1 bitcoin at 12:10pm GMT on February 5th, that's a pretty unique transaction. She could simply say ""our records show that this transaction went out, at this time, with these parameters. The transaction ID must have changed, so I'm not resending those bitcoins.""  An exchange could also implement tools to automatically track inputs on transactions, which would help it spot mutations.  If anything, transaction malleability will help prove the decentralized network's resilience against discrete network events. Decentralization is one of the things that makes it the 'honey badger of money', after all.

42376880,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6fy65,1392165258,New York Regulator May Impose Technology Restrictions on Digital Currencies,"Two weeks after his agency held extensive hearings on the subject of regulating virtual currencies, New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) superintendent of financial services Benjamin Lawsky has issued statements that provide greater insight into the actions the state may take when it seeks to enact bitcoin legislation this year.  Most notably, Lawsky indicated that the NYDFS now feels as though existing money transmission regulation will not be sufficient for virtual currency firms.  Further, he suggested the NYDFS could move to mandate that all virtual currencies maintain a public block chain due to its potential to help track criminal wrongdoing, and that bitcoin businesses that qualify as money transmitters could be made to comply with certain net worth and permissible investment requirements.  Speaking at the New America Foundation in Washington DC, Lawsky said:  ""As we have noted previously, certain aspects of virtual currency do not fit neatly into the traditional categories we think of in financial regulation – such as banking, insurance, or the like.""  Lawsky continued his organization's friendly approach to addressing the ecosystem, adding asides to his remarks that noted the benefits virtual currencies could bring to the ecosystem and the ongoing problems in the traditional financial system.  A starting point for regulation  Despite earlier comments that indicated that NYDFS would look to enact regulation for wallets and exchanges, the places where virtual currencies are exchanged for fiat, Lawsky seemed less certain about this action in his statements. He also acknowledged that the ability for the NYDFS to put in place the more extensive oversight desired by law enforcement officials would be limited.  For example, he noted that overseeing every transaction on the network would likely be impossible, and mentioned that the NYDFS will heed FinCEN's guidance to leave individual miners without any oversight, though it expressed an interest in this area.  In addition, Lawsky indicated that his agency is not as concerned with bitcoin's potential for money laundering.  ""Let’s be frank, a lot more money has been laundered through large banks than has been laundered through virtual currency.""  Safety and soundness requirements  To help increase safety in the ecosystem, Lawsky noted that virtual currency firms will likely be made to meet similar requirements as traditional money transmitters.  Specifically, he noted that such firms are ""limited in the types of investments they can hold"", so as not to put consumers in jeopardy, and that they may need to hold enough capital to provide safeguards against industry turbulence. Said Lawsky:  ""Net worth, capital and permissible investment requirements are among the most important consumer protection requirements we can put in place as regulators.""  Consumer disclosure  Lawsky reiterated that stronger consumer protections were needed for virtual currency firms, especially as the industry grows and less experienced and less knowledgeable consumers enter the industry.  ""If virtual currencies ultimately garner wider adoption among the general public, it will be important for consumers to be armed with the information they need to make the financial choices that are best for them,"" Lawsky said.  In particular, he noted consumers should be warned that all bitcoin transactions are irreversible and that the loss private keys could jeopardize their funds.  However, despite the comments, it should be noted that the NYDFS has yet to announce a formal timeline for any decision-making.
