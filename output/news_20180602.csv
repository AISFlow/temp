42429167,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLs3Bh,1527946155,How to Watch the EOS Blockchain Launch,"Block.One is giving away its $4 billion code this weekend and it's anyone's guess what will happen next.  As profiled by CoinDesk, EOS is set to launch sometime soon, though the company that built its code is going out of its way to prove the software really will be open-source. This means it isn't even designating an official launch. Rather, it's up to potential users to take it from there (whether that results in chaos or not).  In some ways, it's the latest unorthodox approach by EOS and its founding team, which has attracted controversy even for its architecture. (To process thousands of operations every second, EOS will rely on just 21 validators or ""block producers"" to verify each transaction,an approach the differentiate from bitcoin's commonly copied model, in which any ""miner"" running the software on a certain kind of hardware can do this.)  Right now, though, the question is whether or not EOS can successfully launch.  Someone needs to launch the code. It needs to get tested and verified. Block producer candidates need to publicly identify themselves. One of them will need to be randomly chosen to create the genesis block, and then voting on the official first slate of block producers will take place. Even then, 15 percent of all the tokens in existence need to vote in order for EOS to turn on.  This mean there's going to be a few interesting moments in this launch to watch for, which can be broken down into a series of questions.  These include:  How long after the code release will it take before someone launches the software? A group of block producer candidates have committed to running a series of tests on the software before creating the first block, but it's open source. Nothing is stopping someone else from running it.  Will the genesis block get created without incident? When the initial block producers line up to win a position in the circle of validators, a random selection process will decide which create that first block. This has to happen in a way that everyone is comfortable with.  Which block producers get voted in to the top jobs? Most people would probably agree that the best scenario ends up seeing some really sophisticated groups located all over the world getting chosen to serve as block producers. What happens if they are mostly located in one country, though?  Will certain block producers be hit with distributed denial of service attacks? This is all but guaranteed. Who knows which ones will be hit, why or how well equipped they are to weather them.  Do the choices for block producers stabilize? Voting will be continuous. Will users change their votes once they see the composition of block producers after it first goes live, or will that first group basically hold steady?  Still, crypto-enthusiasts are likely to want to follow along whether or not they see EOS as progress or not.  This is a huge new experiment for crypto, so those most invested in this technology will want to watch as closely as they can to see how this technological big bang spreads.  Unfortunately, because it's so new, no one has created anything like a block explorer yet. There's not user-friendly tools for viewing vote counts or even seeing which block producers get chosen. There's also no official time for any of these events. And since different groups may attempt to initiate different launches, they might happen multiple times.  The best way to follow along in real time will be the social media channels these teams have been using the communicate so far:  Github Issues and Pull Requests  EOS is open source code, meaning it's been publishing its work on GitHub all along. Block.One has released a few versions so far for teams to experiment with and develop on.  A quick skim of the ""issues"" page on the EOS code repository shows that the number of issues (bugs, vulnerabilities and other problems) identified has been accelerating as it gets closer to launch.  This is natural as the urgency becomes more severe and there are more eyes on the code, but if it explodes that could be a sign of serious issues.  Watch along with EOS Go  EOS Go has been the internet's collective cheerleader for EOS, working primarily on Steemit and YouTube to provide education about the launch process. They have a lot of streams planned for this weekend and watching on there might be one of the easiest ways to follow along.  The group has already done live interviews with all the major block producer candidates, and they will be key to setting up the network. With lines of communication open to all those groups, they should know what's going on, minute by by minute. It's just going to be a lot of video to get through.  There are extended streams planned throughout the weekend. One for several hours on Saturday, two on Sunday and two on Monday. Look for them to talk live with block producers around the world as the code gets tested and then ultimately launched.  Telegram  We're sorry about this, but yes: Telegram channels. The smart bet will probably be to go to the @EOSBlockPros channel, where block producer candidates (the groups vying for the lucrative spots validating transactions on the network) will discuss what's going on.  There's also a general EOS channel, but like most community wide Telegram channels that's mostly people asking the same questions over and over again. This weekend, that will almost certainly be: ""What can I do if I didn't create an EOS wallet before June 1?""  Provided EOS (or a few versions of the software) launch successfully, it shouldn't be long until developers spin up some more direct ways to peer into its governance system, such as portals for viewing transaction volumes, staked votes and the average size of blocks. During this launch, though, all of that will be hidden in the bowels of servers.

42429154,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLs2lh,1527944110,Save the World? Blockchain's Big Dreams Come Back to Earth in DC,"""Who is actually getting results?""  Whispered between attendees in a crowd of 300 at the Blockchain for Social Impact conference in Washington D.C. on June 1, the statement may have summed up the sentiment at the event.  The group assembled at the U.S. Institute for Peace may have spanned from ethereum entrepreneurs to crypto-curious international development workers, but across that broad spectrum, the sentiment was shockingly cohesive: People want to see results, results, results.  Sandra Hart, Pacific cash and livelihoods advisor at the Oxfam, told CoinDesk:  ""We need to stress-test blockchains in complex environments. It's about being demand driven instead of supply driven.""  Gone are the days of excited chatter surrounding proof-of-concept presentations and lucrative token sales. Here to stay, it seems, is the idea the best way to get results is by engaging the people or communities the product or service is geared to help.  Hart, as an example, is working on a blockchain pilot in Vanuatu, one of the world's most disaster-prone island nations. This program, which will run from around September 2018 to February 2019, leverages blockchain-linked IDs to deliver credit to up to 1,000 households displaced by a recent volcano.  Across the board, many attendees at the conference noticed the same challenges and opportunities that Hart faces as she sets up Oxfam's humanitarian blockchain program. Namely, that blockchain solutions for disenfranchised populations work best when they are built cooperatively with recipients and community leaders to complement local habits and infrastructure.  Vanessa Grellet, executive director at the ethereum-centric startup conglomerate ConsenSys, agreed with Hart's insistence on meeting people where they are.  ""I'm the least bullish about projects that try to change behavior without economics,"" Grellet told CoinDesk.  The statement spoke to her belief that technologists need to avoid preaching about wealth creation and instead listen to how people already use products or services.  In Hart's case, Oxfam is working with the Vanuatu Society for People with Disabilities and Youth Challenge Vanuatu to make a smartphone application that represents fiat currencies, since the community is more familiar with mobile devices and cash than credit cards or tokens.  Hart was among many experts at the conference who urged blockchain enthusiasts to build applications alongside diverse communities, not for them.  Remember the real world  In short, Hart put forth another argument that saw discussion at the event, whether tokens are necessary to engage broad communities of supporters. No matter how snazzy the product or service may be, she ultimately argues tokens might not incentivize people who weren't already interested.  ""It's very common that usability is a question mark, based on the cultural context,"" she said, adding:  ""Beneficiaries or recipients are used to choosing what they buy instead of receiving in-kind assistance, which takes the dignity and choice out of the assistance process.""  Grellet agreed that two of the major challenges hindering blockchain projects is that many don't understand the problem they are trying to solve or work with people who actually experience those pain points.  To make matters worse, few teams truly prioritize design, a key component of creating technology that people will actually use. On the other hand, some innovative projects fall short of tangible results because they shoot for the moon before gaining traction on the ground.  ""There's incremental change and there's system change,"" Grellet said. ""What you propose is usually system change.""  Therein lies the same issue faced by activists across sectors: Bureaucracy is a slow and stubborn beast.  To counter these common pitfalls, Grellet advised blockchain enthusiasts plan baby steps that leverage existing user habits while working toward broader disruption. This approach can curb impulses to evangelize Western habits to cultural contexts where they don't make sense.  ""We're not convinced we want to bank the unbanked,"" Grellet said. ""We don't want them to go into a system that rejected them. We want to help create new systems and new creditworthiness, capacities, new ways for them to engage with new institutions that allow them to have access to funds.""  Although Grellet is inspired by startups that reduce friction and expenses for remittance, for example, she said those blockchain solutions leave the underlying problem intact.  ""We want to solve the fact that they [remittance recipients] have less opportunities,"" she said. ""You can always reduce costs. But that's sort of a band-aid.""  Plus, many of these communities don't have the same connectivity as technologists enjoy in Silicon Valley or London.  ""What do you do when you have to do things off the chain?"" Hart asked, speaking to spotty electricity in some areas of Vanuatu. ""How do we develop these products and say, you [developers] have to tweak this, change this, in order to make these products more adaptable and accessible when you work in humanitarian environments.""  Partners not users  The real trick is decentralizing access to resources.  To that end, startups like RightMesh, which raised $30 million in a token sale that concluded this week, are looking to put their tokens where their proverbial mouth is.  RightMesh's blockchain product manager, Brianna MacNeil, told CoinDesk her startup has a team of roughly 100 developers in Bangladesh who are building applications for the upcoming mesh network platform. Eventually, RightMesh users will be able to access the mesh network with their regular mobile devices, offering connectivity without WiFi.  This speaks to some of the infrastructure challenges Hart noticed as well.  ""They are working on all kinds of open-source apps,"" MacNeil said. ""We don't know all the applications of mesh networking. So, we want to put the tools in the hands of these developers so they can build new apps that may not have been possible otherwise, in part because of the lack of connectivity in some communities.""  This is what Gellet said she is most excited about in 2018, diversifying the open-source developer community.  ""We're going to really see internationalization, taking this really global and having local talent create the solutions. That's not just a U.S., Western conversation,"" she said.  During a panel about refugee communities, Techfugee CEO Josephine Goube delivered a similar plea to the audience: ""Please stop coming to me and asking me to build [apps].""  Instead, Goube clarified her startup offers resources and opportunities for displaced people to make their own tools. She warned against trying to make blockchain solutions for refugees, a population of roughly 65.6 million people worldwide according to the United Nations Human Rights Council.  Next, after empowering these communities, Gellet said the way to scale their local impact is to get enterprises and institutions on board at some level.  ""What's really key in this space is collaboration,"" Gellet said. ""We will not succeed without the collaboration of governments, charities, NGOs, enterprises, technologists, all together in the same room.""  And yet, for some international development experts, the questions remains: Why use a blockchain instead of a database?  Robert Opp, director of innovation and change management at the UN World Food Programme, addressed this conundrum during his talk about the ethereum pilot program distributing food to 10,000 Syrian refugees in Jordan.  ""If we thought this was the endpoint in the World Food Programme, we would use a database,"" he told the crowd about plans to expand the program to 500,000 people and corresponding identity tech tools, adding:  ""This isn't the endpoint. This is the beginning.""
