42379162,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nFb1,1484349008,Ethereum Classic Freezes 'Difficulty Bomb' With 'Diehard' Fork,"Ethereum classic just forked again.  Though hard forking can be a particularly contentious way of upgrading open blockchains (particularly since it can split the network if not all miners decide to update), the developers behind the project are calling the effort a success thus far.  Ethereum classic developer Arvicco noted on social media that the mining hashrate is stable on the network and transactions are being transmitted normally.  Named ""Diehard"" after the 1980s action film, the fork packages together a few changes, including a tweak to address denial-of-service attacks that slowed down ethereum classic and its sister blockchain, ethereum, last fall.  Yet it's one of the other upgrades included in the release that could further differentiate the blockchain from ethereum, which it split from in August over a difference in direction following the collapse of The DAO.  ECIP 1010  delays the so-called ""difficulty bomb"", originally added to ethereum's code in September 2015 in order to exponentially increase the difficulty of mining, or the competitive process by which new transaction blocks are added to the network.  The idea was to encourage the ecosystem to switch from the existing proof of work framework to a different consensus algorithm known as proof of stake. Ethereum classic is delaying the ""bomb"" by one year in part to give more stakeholders more time to decide which consensus algorithm to pursue.  ""The outcome of it was that delaying the bomb leaves the community with [the] most open options towards [a] long-term choice of consensus mechanism,"" Arvicco said, noting that startup IOHK has been working on a possible proof of stake/proof of work hybrid.  On the other hand, some in the community seem unhappy that they weren't offered a chance to vote on the decision to hard fork.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETC | MINING | FORKS,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2017/01/13/ethereum-classic-freezes-difficulty-bomb-with-diehard-fork,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/623b95d161ed2c500a5ecd66ab10f62b89fdbffa-2560x1709.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42379157,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nFTT,1484342146,Nigeria Warned its Citizens About Onecoin and Bitcoin This Week,"Local advertisements for OneCoin and other digital currency investments have drawn the ire of Nigeria’s top securities regulatory.  In a statement published yesterday by the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the regulator warned that potential investors should ""exercise extreme caution"" in light of radio advertisements and other sales pitches made for OneCoin, bitcoin and types of digital currencies.  The agency said in a statement:  ""The Commission wishes to alert the public that none of the persons, companies or entities promoting cryptocurrencies has been recognized or authorized by it or by other regulatory agencies in Nigeria to receive deposits from the public or to provide any investment or other financial services in or from Nigeria.""  Nigeria's SEC went on to state that in some cases, those promoting the aforementioned advertisement may be conducting wholly fraudulent enterprises.  ""The public should also be aware that any investment opportunities promoted by these persons, companies or entities are likely to be of a risky nature with a high risk of loss of money, whilst others may be outright fraudulent pyramid schemes,"" the statement read.  The timing is perhaps unsurprising, given recent developments.  Earlier this month, the controversial Ponzi scheme system MMM announced that it would reopen its doors in Nigeria, telling prospective users that it would introduce bitcoin as a form of payment, according to a report from Quartz.  OneCoin – which has widely accused of operating a fraudulent Ponzi scheme and has been targeted by other regulatory warnings and investigations – also does business in Nigeria.  Nigerian authorities have previously called for improved regulation of digital currency in the country.  In mid-2015, Okwu Nnanna of the Central Bank of Nigeria advocated for the creation of new rules to prevent potential money laundering arising from use of the tech.

42379152,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nFPh,1484339723,Report: Blockchain Could Become an $8 Billion Global Industry By 2024,"The next eight years could see the blockchain marketplace grow to almost $8bn in value, according to a new research report.  The report, prepared by Grand View Research, points to a combination of industry investments, enterprise interest in blockchain solutions and growing use of digital currencies among consumers as the lead driver of expected growth.  Overall, the market could be as valuable as $7.74bn by 2024, the firm estimated.  As for where geographically that growth is anticipated to take place, Grand View suggests that most is going to emerge from financial sectors in the both the North American and Asia-Pacific markets.  On the latter area, the agency suggests, significant growth will be seen over the next eight years.  The company said of its estimates:  ""The growing financial sector in emerging countries such as China and India is predicted to stimulate the Asia Pacific regional growth. The regional industry is presumed to grow at a [compound annual growth rate] of 37.6% in the coming years.""  While Grand View’s take on the years leading up to 2024 may be a bit rosy, industry commentators have speculated that the next year or two could see significant growth in the blockchain space, particularly as commercial-scale products and services begin to come online in a meaningful way.  As Deloitte's Eric Piscini speculated in a recent op-ed for CoinDesk, 2017 is shaping up to be a “make-or-break year” for the technology.  Other commentators  have pointed to the need to both learn the lessons of the past, as well as work collaboratively moving forward, as that period of growth begins.

42379163,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nFYV,1484336428,Israel's Tax Authority Wants to Treat Bitcoin As a Kind of Property,"Israel's government is set to apply capital gains tax to bitcoin sales, categorizing digital currencies as a type of property.  According to a statement published on 11th January, the Israel Tax Authority (ITA) said that it would consider bitcoin and other digital currencies as a kind of intangible asset rather than a foreign currency.  Profits would then be taxed at the capital gains rate, which in Israel begins at 25%.  The agency said in a translated statement:  ""...and therefore [bitcoins] will be considered in accordance with the Income Tax Ordinance as assets and their sale will be taxed as a sale of 'property' and income from their sale will be classified as capital.”  Individuals involved in the sale or mining of digital currencies would be subject to business tax rates. Further, any commercial sales of bitcoin or transactions involved with trading are subject to value-added tax (VAT), the agency said.  The release comes more than three years after word first emerged that Israel would seek some degree of taxation on bitcoin transactions. In late 2013, officials from the tax agency were quoted as saying that they wanted to pursue a means of taxing profits on bitcoin sales, but that they were uncertain on how to do so.  The move echoes the decision made by US tax authorities in 2014, when it moved to classify bitcoin as a type of taxable property.

42379156,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nFSD,1484329846,Coinbase Prepares to Fight IRS Summons With New Court Filing,"UPDATE (13th January 21:30 BST): This article has been updated with comment from Coinbase.      Court documents filed in the District Court for the Northern District of California this week show that lawyers for the California-based startup have filed to officially intervene in the case.  The US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) launched its case in late November, seeking court approval for a subpoena that would allow it to obtain information on US users (and, in its eyes, potential tax cheats) who used the service between 2013 and 2015. A month later, Coinbase customer Jeffrey Berns moved to block the IRS, an effort the tax agency asked the court to invalidate.  Both Coinbase and Berns have said the tax agency is overreaching, though the startup hadn’t officially responded in court until now. When the case first emerged in November, representatives for the firm said they intended to protest the summons in court.  Coinbase lawyers wrote in the documents that, amidst the filings and counter-filings, the startup deserves to be heard in light of ""an extraordinarily broad 'John Doe' summons"". The startup is seeking both the chance to have say in the effort led by Berns as well as the IRS summons itself.  The company said:  ""The motion to intervene is made on the grounds that Coinbase has an interest in the subject matter of this proceeding, and that disposition of the action may, as a practical matter, impair or impede Coinbase’s ability to protect that interest. Coinbase’s interest is not adequately represented by the existing parties.""  In addition to seeking official entry into the case, Coinbase asked that a hearing on the motion filed by Berns be delayed until 30th March at the earliest. The reason: according to the startup, the outcome of the case could have ramifications for the company and its customer base, as well as the wider digital currency space.  ""Accordingly, Coinbase would like the opportunity to be heard, at an appropriate time, on the substantive issues that Mr. Berns has raised to the IRS summons at issue,"" the company said.  When reached for comment, a representative for Coinbase told CoinDesk:  ""Both the IRS and Mr. Berns have engaged in briefing both the procedural questions of Mr. Bern’s standing to intervene and also the substantive merits of the IRS’s subpoena. To ensure the court does not rule on the substantive merits of the IRS’s subpoena before they have heard from Coinbase and other companies in the industry, we have filed a motion to intervene and have asked the court to delay hearing on the substantive aspects of Mr. Bern’s motions for 75 days.""

42379177,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nFnb,1484322910,Bitcoin: This is Not the Same as 2013,"Chris Burniske is blockchain products lead at ARK Invest, an investment manager focused on disruptive innovation and co-author of the new white paper, ""Bitcoin, a New Asset Class"".  In this CoinDesk opinion piece, Burniske pushes back on the mainstream media, arguing that the idea bitcoin is merely repeating the infamy of 2013 is misinformed.  A common but mistaken refrain is building that bitcoin's behavior of late has been a replica of the infamous late 2013 rise and crash.  Certainly, a similar narrative could be spun: bitcoin breaks $1,000, the People's Bank of China issues some comments that scare people, bitcoin crashes. But if a few marketplace characteristics are investigated, I think the difference in bitcoin's maturity between then and now becomes clear.  On 5th December, 2013, a short while after bitcoin broke $1,000, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) sent out a statement claiming bitcoin was ""not a currency in the real meaning of the word"". The PBOC went on to restrict financial institutions from getting further involved with the technology.  Last week, on 6th January, 2017, a short while after bitcoin broke $1,000 for the second time in its eight-year life, the PBOC sent out new statements indicating that its representatives had met with major China-based bitcoin exchanges to reinforce the importance of remaining compliant with ""relevant laws and regulations.""  The tenor of the statements was markedly different, but let’s focus on the numbers.  Then and now  Following both announcements, bitcoin quickly fell below $1,000, which is what has led to the false proclamation that bitcoin hasn’t changed a bit since 2013.  I believe such a proclamation is born of ignorance around the specific market dynamics.  As shown below, the daily percent changes in bitcoin's price both leading up to the PBOC announcement, and after the announcement, have not been nearly as severe as they were in 2013.  On the X-axis of the graph is a metric called, 'Days Removed from People’s Bank of China Announcement'. In other words, the zero point for 2013 is 5th December, while for 2017 it's 6th January: those are the days when the PBOC announcements went public.  ""-60"" is sixty days before the PBOC announcement, in each respective year.  Taking the standard deviation of these daily percent price changes yields one of the most common metrics for volatility, as shown below.  In 2013, the volatility in the 60 days leading up to the PBOC announcement was more than 3x the volatility preceding the PBOC announcement in 2017.  The volatility in the week after was twice as great in 2013, as well.  It appears, however, that some bitcoin investors are suffering PTSD. After all, the 2013 announcement precipitated a long slide in bitcoin’s price through 2014, bottoming in January 2015.  Such fear may explain why volatility on a relative basis jumped more after the recent announcement than it did in 2013. In other words, in 2013 the volatility roughly doubled after the PBOC announcement, while this year it has roughly tripled.  That said, volatility after the PBOC announcement this time around is still less than the volatility before the PBOC announcement in 2013.  Critics have come out of the woodwork recently, many once again proclaiming bitcoin is too volatile for most portfolios.  However, if an investor has held Twitter, LinkedIn, Workday, Netflix, GoPro, Tableau and many more high-flying tech names over the last few years, then they have endured single day drops greater than bitcoin has experienced over the last week.  A new asset class  I think bitcoin's subdued volatility in the face of fears over China is a sign of its maturing markets.  For instance, liquidity has improved considerably, with global trading volumes roughly 30x greater than they were in late 2013.  Meanwhile, it appears a more informed base of investors now has the conviction to hold through the whims of nation-states, picking up the slack from weak hands.  Yet, at the moment, bitcoin may not be stable enough to be a currency.  Its price swings are still great enough that they could cause havoc if bitcoin was a broadly used unit of account (and they do wreak havoc on other cryptocurrencies, where bitcoin is often used as the unit of account).  Furthermore, changes in bitcoin’s price make it harder to use bitcoin as a means of exchange, because significant exchange rate risk can arise.  But, if bitcoin is a new asset class — as I've put forth in paper authored with Coinbase — then it doesn’t need to behave like other assets we already know in order to gain mainstream adoption.  I think it just needs to mature, and signs are that it’s doing just that.

42379170,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nFen,1484313671,China's Bitcoin Exchanges Quietly Made Policy Updates Overnight,"China's major bitcoin exchanges halted, or otherwise updated, their lending-based bitcoin trading services today.  First reported by China-based bitcoin traders and market observers this morning, BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin appear to have quietly adjusted their terms, though only BTCC had moved to issue a formal comment confirming the changes.  Bobby Lee, CEO of BTCC, acknowledged that changes to the exchange's service were being made in response to interactions with the People's Bank of China, the country’s central bank, though he stopped short of saying that the service had been terminated or disabled.  Lee indicated that the move came after the exchange received ""informal guidance"" from the PBoC, which has been more actively engaged with domestic bitcoin exchanges amid the run-up in bitcoin prices seen at the start of the year. The developments followed news that central bank officials had met with representatives from the exchanges.  Lee told CoinDesk:  ""There's going to be some give and take. We'll likely make adjustments as time goes on.""  At press time, BTCC is the only exchange to explain the changes in a message posted to its website.  ""BTCC will [suspend loans and borrowing services] from 12th January, 2017,"" it reads.  OKCoin and Huobi did not respond to requests for further information, though a customer service representative for Huobi had indicated that it had ""paused"" new lending services.  At press time, traders were reporting that loan-based trading services were no longer available on Huobi.  OKCoin's international and China-facing websites OKCoin.com and OKCoin.cn were said to be offering limited or augmented versions of the services, though traders were reporting different experiences.  While some users told CoinDesk they were able to borrow 2x leverage at press time (even when executing CNY-denominated trades on OKCoin.cn), others indicated that their accounts were prohibiting this action.  One trader said he was able to see higher margin options, but only able to borrow lower amounts. (OKCoin representatives did not respond to requests for further clarity).  Sensitive time  Nonetheless, news spread quickly about the changes on social media, with seven local industry representatives acknowledging they were aware of the supposed changes (some noted that they had yet to actively test their perceptions via exchange accounts).  Still, local traders indicated that they were not surprised by the news that some margin trading services had been updated, given the longstanding lack of legal clarity under which the exchanges had operated.  One former representative of a China-based exchange, who declined to be quoted on the record, indicated that he is unsure of whether the issue would have been with the service itself or the way it was marketed to consumers.  ""I don't know if it's [paused] while they implement a system that's agreeable to the government, or if it's gone for good,"" he said.  OTC trader Zhao Dong, likewise, hinted at how this development could come to shape the bitcoin markets, portraying it as a double-edged sword for the industry.  ""The good side of margin trading is it provided additional liquidity to the market, the bad side is it is easy for investors to lose money,"" he said.  Yet from some quarters of the Chinese bitcoin space, there was a broad feeling that further engagement with regulators will be forthcoming.  Ricardo Zhang, CEO for BTC123, a local bitcoin lending and news site that yesterday paused its services, told CoinDesk:  ""I think this time, there will be some corresponding laws and regulations promulgated, and a more standardized industry.""

42379169,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nFg3,1484311956,Hardly Anyone Seems to Be Using Zcash's Anonymity Features,"There's been plenty to gawk at since Zcash's October launch.  Heralded as the world's most anonymous cryptocurrency, Zcash rode a wave of hype with its cypherpunk origin story (complete with its own secretive ""ceremony"") and an initial frenzy where speculators drove the price of its tokens over $1,000 before they were even released.  But perhaps above all, the technology has become synonymous with the promise of its bleeding-edge cryptography, zk-SNARKS, which shield senders and receivers, as well as the balances of each zcash address. Only users with the correct ""key"" can reveal the contents.  But Zcash isn't always anonymous. Today, users have a choice between two types of Zcash addresses, and the thing is, three months in, not many people appear to be using the ones with its signature anonymity feature.  Just like bitcoin addresses, Zcash features ""transparent addresses"" which show account balances where coins are sent or received. But these are the kind of public transaction that Zcash has been fighting to eradicate with ""shielded addresses"", its primary innovation that utilizes zk-SNARKS.  But for now, the two types exist side by side, and users seem to be choosing transparent addresses for the most part.  While it's hard to come up with precise figures for usage, shielded address hold only a small percentage, roughly 0.8%, of Zcash value right now. Browsing the most recent Zcash transactions, you can see that many of the ""transparent value"" spots are filled in, and the rate of shielded transactions looks to be above 0.8%.  Shielded pool  Oddly enough, this data might actually be a display of how uniquely powerful Zcash's cryptography is.  Even this early on, project founder Zooko Wilcox pointed out that most of the 400,000 ZEC in circulation have already been filtered through a shielded address. And those that haven't yet, need to be.  One consensus protocol rule says that miners must move their tokens through a shielded address before they can use them.  Think of a mysterious pool into which every shielded address ever used is dropped. As miners process more transactions, and people continue to create and use shielded addresses, this pool will continue to grow.  When someone makes a transaction coming from a shielded address, you wouldn't be able to determine where the transaction came from – it could be coming from any address in that pool.  ""They can't tell if it’s from a recent shielded transaction or an old shielded transaction from years ago,"" Wilcox said.  So, if coins pass ever pass through a shielded address, they will feature some level of privacy.  At the very least, even if one set of coins later continues to be passed from transparent address to transparent address, its origins will be mysterious – it could have come from one of the original miners or any of the other shielded addresses in the history of Zcash.  Why opt-in?  If more people using shielded addresses is good for privacy, it begs the question, why is the Zcash feature opt-in?  Privacy would be better for everyone on the network, Wilcox conceded, but he described the decision to make Zcash backwards-compatible with bitcoin as a sort of Trojan Horse.  It's easier for companies to add support for the type of address that bitcoin supports (and has now done so for eight years) than for novel shielded addresses.  There's some evidence that this strategy is bearing fruit. Blockstack, which recently raised a $4m investment, aims to roll out support for Zcash in the future.  While Blockstack is ""blockchain-agnostic"", the company is working to support ethereum and Zcash because of the massive interest shown for each, explained Blockstack co-founder Ryan Shea.  ""Zcash would be the easiest to support by far,"" he added, citing transparent addresses as the reason. ""The interface is almost exactly the same.""  Support for shielded addresses, though, would take more time.  However, Blockstack isn't the only company to ponder adding Zcash for the sake of convenience. On launch day, Zcash announced a long list of third-party support, including two wallets specifically made for Zcash, and popular companies like Kraken, ShapeShift, and Jaxx. Keybase and OpenBazaar also recently announced support.  Notably, many of these third parties support only transparent addresses so far.  'Advancement of science'  But while Zcash is now a live network, there's the feeling that the user experience needs polishing.  For one, making shielded addresses easier to use will be big focus in 2017 for the Zcash Company, of which Wilcox is CEO. For example, the firm intends to streamline the memory-intensive shielded transactions so that they take less time to use. (Right now, it takes a minute or two with 4 GB of RAM to generate the proof that provides transactions with such high anonymity.)  Not to mention, zk-SNARKS are only understood by a few.  Wilcox noted that precise information about how transparent and shielded addresses mix is not well-known or public, as Zcash is trying the anonymizing proofs on the blockchain for the first time.  ""That part is really confusing to me and to everyone. I hope we'll get some clarity into how to understand and analyze this stuff,"" he said.  Looking forward  All that said, these are small steps to a much bigger goal of an anonymous payment network that people can use, and analysts and observers aren't quite ringing alarm bells just yet.  ”Overall, I think Zcash is doing very well, but is still in an early stage,"" cryptographer and Zcash advisor Andrew Miller, who participated in Zcash's opening ceremony, told CoinDesk.  Further, there seems to be some demand for private online money.  Two-year-old Monero, which uses different privacy technology called 'ring signatures' to shield transaction information, is now supported by the exchange Kraken, and it recently rose to fourth or fifth biggest cryptocurrency in terms of market cap. Meanwhile, bitcoin and ethereum developers are also working on a range of privacy projects.  Zcash even spawned a copycat, Zclassic, which uses much the same codebase as Zcash except that, much like bitcoin classic and ethereum classic, it changes the protocol to align with an ideological difference.  In Zclassic’s case, supporters disagreed with the decision to award Zcash founders with 20% of the mining proceeds for the first four years (the website refers to it as a ""tax""). The blockchain's creator, Rhett Creighton, told CoinDesk that he launched the competing version partially because he thinks it holds long-term promise.  ""At the launch, I was sitting there thinking, 'What if this is the point in history where the money people use in the next 100 years is created, and we just let 20% of it go to a handful of people?'"" Creighton said, adding that removing the reward was an easy tweak to the code.  Yet, it's been two months since the split and there still hasn't been much vendor adoption (for either project, in truth).  As Zcash launched less than three months ago, bitcoin and ethereum have the advantage of an ecosystem that’s been built up over eight years (as of last Tuesday) and two years, respectively. Still, arguably, insufficient time for large numbers of vendors to pick up the currencies.  However, Miller is optimistic, concluding:  ""I am most looking forward to seeing businesses or merchants adopting Zcash and that hasn't happened yet, but that naturally seems to come after more of the infrastructure is in place, like more exchange volume and wallet support.""

42379175,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nFl5,1484304974,Blockchain's R-Word (And 3 Other Trends for 2017),"Simon Taylor is co-founder and director at 11:FS, a FinTech advisory firm, and the former vice president of entrepreneurial partnerships at Barclays.      In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Taylor discusses what he sees as the challenges (and opportunities) ahead for enterprise applications of distributed ledger tech.          2016 has been a rollercoaster year for those of us following blockchain and distributed ledger tech.  Whether it was bitcoin pushing toward $1,000, a consortium of banks open-sourcing software with R3's Corda, or government and central banks supporting blockchain experimentations, you can't deny the subject has been everywhere.  While some have grown tired of the endless press releases and bickering about ledger designs, in the background, real progress is being made, and major organizations are already placing their bets.  In 2017, I’m watching for maturity in the active projects both from startups and blockchain communities, as well as the incumbent financial services companies. Evolution and revolution are necessary, and I believe we can learn from both.  But, if you're new to this space, it may not be obvious where you should invest your time or resources.  To help you make those decisions, I've identified four macro trends I see happening in 2017.  1. Revenue becomes the big question  ""Where is the end product?""  My projection is, this will be a common question this year as executives and mainstream media look but fail to see the traction being made.  But for the first time, 2017 might see it answered as the launch of the first real distributed ledger products go live, likely with a focus on gold trading. Right when you think you don't have to do anything, real-world, scalable financial products hit the financial markets.  So while the 'end product' question will emerge (and go away), others will debut.  As 2017 is unlikely to be the year DLT scales for corporates, many will begin to ask, 'Where's the revenue?' The business cases are out there, they’re just not obvious from 30,000 ft.  2. The beginning of 'new businesses'  While everyone is obsessed with who's in what consortium, what's more interesting is what systems people are building and what that will mean.  We're seeing the beginnings of real structural change in financial markets.  If you imagine financial markets today as being 100% centralized, with bitcoin being 100% decentralized, then financial markets are taking baby steps away from centralised power.  Over time, any shift in the first number is significant.  My guess is that as banks talk more about ""smart contracts"" and DLT instead of ""blockchain"", the market will recognize that these corporate things are neither shared databases nor blockchains, but some new interesting thing.  For now, this has been given the label ""DLT"", but likely needs a more accurate one.  Yet, in financial markets, where new asset classes or financial agreements become revenue opportunities for banks and financial market participants, a new narrative must emerge. One that moves away from ""cost and efficiency"" only.  3. Bitcoin goes enterprise  I’ve long been an advocate of mainstreaming bitcoin and (outside of rising interest in DLT) I predict mainstream attitudes are starting to change about bitcoin.  Companies like PwC, Deloitte and others are making major plays in bitcoin and ethereum, and companies like Bloq and Blockstream have started to resemble the early days of Linux enterprise companies, making open-source ""wild"" software tame and consumable for large corporates.  In this environment, institutional investors may start to leverage bitcoin’s infrastructure and even go deeper into bitcoin investing.  Given that the line between the bitcoin world and the banking world could start blurring (as new business models emerge beyond payments and remittances, and wallets are released) this seems even more likely to occur.  It will be very small at first, but projects like t0 are the types of things we may look back on in 25 years as a watershed moment.  4. Experimentation will continue  The current experimentation environment is super interesting to watch, and new business models will emerge. However, there will be failures, as well.  We might have one, maybe two, smaller DAO-like failures in the public blockchain space. As we go through this learning and experimentation, a more useable, more robust framework for token or smart contract-based businesses compatible with local laws will start to emerge.  There is no good reason why you couldn’t build a business this way now, it’s just much harder than a bog-standard token sale.  There has been some good legal advice on how to do token sales well, but the idea that these “products” should be pre-sold to fund these efforts needs rethinking.  My guess is we'll begin to see more creativity beyond the ICO as we know it today.

42379172,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nFhJ,1484269416,Bitcoin Took a Break From Being Volatile and Broke $800 Today,"The price of bitcoin enjoyed a break from its recent volatility today, spending most of the day trading within reasonably tight ranges.  Overall, the digital currency's price started by fluctuating mostly between $745 and $775, CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) figures reveal, before tracking higher.  Later, the price would edge upward, passing $800 at 16:30 UTC, and proceeding to trade between $800 and $820 until roughly 21:00 UTC.  At the time of report, bitcoin was trading at $804.30.  Though this may seem like a bumpy day, the developments follow nearly a week of sessions in which prices roiled on the news the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) had held meetings with the country’s major exchanges last week.  Prior to this, bitcoin prices had been trading at a three-year high of $1,153, however, uncertainty over the nature and outcome of the meetings (though all parties have provided public statements on their content) continues to linger.  Watch and wait  For a while this resulted in volatility, but bitcoin was arguably more stable today as market participants became interested in how any long-term trend could develop.  To some observers, the decline in price fluctuations could simply be the result of traders who are sitting on the sidelines and waiting to see what will come of this government inquiry.  According to Petar Zivkovski, COO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, the market hasn't decided if it's going up or down just yet.  ""The market is in a state of uncertainty and has failed to recover as of yet, despite reaching a monthly support level around $750,"" he said.  Zivkovski noted that until the nation’s central bank has provided greater clarity on the matter, he believes that bitcoin prices could experience significant volatility.  In suspense  Other, wilder theories emerged as well.  Arthur Hayes, CEO of bitcoin options exchange BitMEX, noted that the market is in a ""state of suspense"" pending updates, though he suggested the downside risk of further action was high.  Hayes went so far as to speculate that the PBOC could limit margin trading, an event he suggested would limit volume and harm prices.  Adding to the suspense is that the market movements resemble those observed in 2013, when PBOC actions derailed the digital currency's appreciation and sent it on a years-long downward slide.  Whether or not history will be repeated is likely something on most traders' minds.
