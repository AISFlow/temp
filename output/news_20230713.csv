Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Inflation data barely stirred crypto markets, but a partial Ripple victory on Thursday sent bitcoin and other major digital assets sailing higher.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $31,328, up 3.2% over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin shot as high as $31,700 near the close of traditional markets, a more than one-year high. With a few blips, BTC had been languishing between $30,000 and $31,000 for the past three weeks as some investors fretted over potential banking missteps to cure inflation and awaited a significant price catalyst.  The Ripple decision offered that spur, at least temporarily. The U.S. District Court of the Southern District of New York ruled that the sale of its XRP tokens on exchanges and through algorithms did not constitute investment contracts. The court also ruled that the institutional sale of the tokens violated federal securities laws.  XRP rose 96% at one point to change hands at 93.6 cents, its highest level since March 2022. It was recently trading at 74 cents, still up more than 73%. XRP is the native cryptocurrency of XRP Ledger, an open-source, public blockchain that is designed to facilitate faster, cheaper payments.  Read More: Ripple, Crypto Industry Score Partial Win in SEC Court Fight Over XRP  In an email to CoinDesk, Dave Weisberger, the co-founder and CEO of crypto algorithmic trading platform CoinRoutes, saw a significant upside in Thursday's event. “The ruling in the Ripple case is important as it specifically renders secondary market trading of utility tokens outside SEC jurisdiction, while preserving their jurisdiction over institutional fundraising,"" Weisberger wrote. ""This is very good news for crypto exchanges and investors regarding a wide range of tokens identified by the SEC in the Coinbase and Binance lawsuits.""  The agency has accused the two exchange giants of violating securities law and mentioned more than a dozen of the largest tokens in value, including those of smart contracts platforms Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL). Those native cryptos dipped sharply in the immediate aftermath, but on Thursday they were skyrocketing with ADA and SOL recently up more than 20% and 17%, respectively. And MATIC, the token of layer 2 blockchain Polygon, which the SEC also flagged, rose more than 16%.  Weisberger wrote that Thursday's ruling ""relieves pressure"" on these tokens, ""and it would not be surprising to see a rally that recovers the initial losses and more.""  Ether, the second largest crypto in market value, jumped past $2,000 for the first time in three months before retreating slightly below this threshold but was still up over 6.5% from Wednesday, same time. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets performance, was up a rousing 6.1%.  Equity indexes rose more modestly with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 climbing 1.5% and 0.8%, respectively. Cryptos and stocks have traveled in increasingly different directions over the past seven months, although investors savored another small jolt of encouraging inflation news as the Producer Price Index (PPI), which measures wholesale price activity, increased by its smallest increment year-over-year in almost a year.  Read More: Bitcoin, Ether Maintain Their 2023 Decoupling from Traditional Finance  CoinRoutes Weisberger believes that that the SEC and Coinbase are now more likely to resolves their differences positively, which should provide additional tailwinds to the market."" Is it a speculative bull market just yet?"" he wrote. ""Probably not. But the foundations for one have certainly been laid.”  Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of crypto fund manager was similarly upbeat about the prospects of multiple spot bitcoin ETF applications filed last month by some of the financial services industry's biggest brands. ""At this point, Bitcoin ETF applications also appear to have promising prospects, and we would be surprised if BTC or other major cryptocurrencies revisit recent lows in the short-term,"" DiPasquale wrote.  He added: ""I spoke with multiple crypto hedge fund investors today who were excited about the favorable legal clarity that the ruling brings.""

Insights  A Calm Among Short-Term BTC Holders  Bitcoin’s relatively calm trade behavior in recent weeks has likely removed the motivation for shorter term holders to sell their asset, contributing to its recent support around $30,000. (BTC surged past $31,000 on Thursday after Ripple won a partial victory in a federal court decision, but the rally's staying power remains uncertain.)  According to Glassnode, the percentage of short-term bitcoin holders in profit exceeds 83%, a decline from 99% in profit to begin July, but far higher than its percentage in January.  Short-term bitcoin supply is BTC purchased within the most recent 155 days. The direction of short- term bitcoin supply, and the extent to which its holders are in profit is important to monitor as a signal about investor sentiment and motivations.  While long-term holders of BTC are likely to maintain their positions in the asset, shorter term traders tend to have less patience for price fluctuations, liquidating their positions in response.

42419886,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGXqX,1689288161,Ripple Labs Ruling Throws U.S. Crypto-Token Regulation into Disarray,"What, legally speaking, is a cryptocurrency token sold to the public?  Following Thursday’s bombshell split decision by judge Analisa Torres of the Southern District of New York (SDNY) in SEC v. Ripple Labs et al., the answer appears to be that XRP is both an unlawfully sold investment contract when sold to VCs or institutional buyers, but a perfectly lawful, “something else” when sold anonymously via cryptocurrency exchanges, or distributed to employees or by insiders.  The only thing this ruling guarantees for cryptocurrency issuers, then, is continued uncertainty in the cryptocurrency markets – uncertainty which Congress, and only Congress, can step in to correct.  Preston Byrne, an occasional CoinDesk columnist, is a corporate partner in Brown Rudnick's Digital Commerce group.  At issue in this case is whether a decade’s worth of token distributions by Ripple Labs are sales of securities by dint of the transactions being “investment contracts” as such term is defined by the “Howey Test” in SEC v W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293 (1946, as clarified by subsequent precedents.  That test says, in brief, that a contract, transaction or scheme involving (1) the investment of money (2) in a common enterprise with (3) a reasonable expectation of profits arising from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others is a juridical critter known as an “investment contract” and is, per the federal Securities Act of 1933, to be regulated in exactly the same manner as a security.  For the purposes of conducting the Howey analysis, the court in Ripple Labs divided Ripple’s sales of tokens into three categories: (1) institutional sales to hedge funds, VCs and the like; (2) programmatic sales to retail directly on digital asset exchanges; and (3) “as a form of payment for services,” such as in restricted token purchase agreements or option contracts, to employees and other service providers.  Ripple loses on “Institutional Sales” of XRP…  On the first category, institutional sales, Ripple lost. There are few if any informed legal commentators who I have seen arguing that any court should have found otherwise.  …but it wins on programmatic sales…  On the second category of sales, programmatic sales, the Court found in Ripple’s favor, arguing that the third, “expectation of profits” prong of Howey was not met. “Ripple’s Programmatic Sales were blind bid/ask transactions,” the Court wrote, “and Programmatic Buyers could not have known if their payments of money went to Ripple, or any other seller of XRP” and as such “a Programmatic Buyer stood in the same shoes as a secondary market purchaser who did not know to whom or what it was paying its money.”  As a result, the Court opined, “Programmatic Buyers purchased XRP with an expectation of profit, but they did not derive that expectation from Ripple’s efforts (as opposed to other factors, such as general cryptocurrency market trends) – particularly because none of the Programmatic Buyers were aware that they were buying XRP from Ripple.”  Is this right?  The Court here is clearly mistaken, for one simple reason: the expectation of profit prong doesn’t require an expectation of profit as a result of the efforts of the seller, but rather the efforts of another; per Howey, “the efforts of the promoter or a third party.” As will be obvious to anyone active in the industry, XRP’s principal promoter is and always has been Ripple Labs, whether a purchaser was aware they were purchasing tokens from Ripple Labs or not.  Read more: Jeff Wilser - Why the XRP Army Keeps Fighting  For why SDNY is mistaken, look no further than its 2020 decision granting the SEC’s motion for a preliminary injunction in a massive win against the Telegram messenger app and its blockchain development subsidiary. There, Judge Kevin P. Castel (more recently famous due to his smackdown of a couple of lawyers who wrote pleadings that included ChatGPT hallucinations) linked purchasers’ expectation of profits “upon the essential entrepreneurial and managerial efforts of Telegram[,]” not the entrepreneurial and managerial efforts of intermediaries who were selling Telegram SAFT contracts to all and sundry at the time.  It was “Telegram’s commitment to develop the project,” not the intermediary sellers’ resale efforts, which the Court held constituted the “essential efforts of another” for the purposes of this Howey prong. Because of this, I expect Ripple’s win on this point to be overturned on appeal.  …and bizarrely Ripple also wins on “Other Distributions” of XRP  Finally, and most bizarrely, Ripple won on the basis that “Other Distributions” to e.g. employees did not satisfy the first prong of Howey, the “investment of money” prong. This one is a real head-scratcher because it is abundantly clear from the precedents that an “investment of money” for Howey purposes need not actually include the transfer of funds – what it requires is only that the purchaser “gave up some tangible and definable consideration in return for an interest that had substantially the characteristics of the security.”  Yet, after stating that Ripple’s “Other Distributions” “include distributions to employees as compensation and… to develop new applications for XRP,” relationships which in practically any commercial setting are regarded as possessing the requisite bi-directional movement of contractual consideration necessary to satisfy this prong (employee provides services; employer provides tokens), the Court concluded that the necessary contractual consideration was nonetheless absent and no “tangible or definable consideration” was paid to Ripple.  Employees providing services and third parties developing applications for use on a protocol strike me, as a commercial lawyer, as profoundly tangible and measurable things, given the great sums of money and crypto-tokens routinely paid to them.  For this reason, this finding strikes me as probably erroneous and vulnerable to challenge on appeal.  Schrodinger’s Shitcoin  The legal status of XRP, then, seems to possess a kind of quantized duality, Schrodinger’s Shitcoin, if you will.It’s a security when sold to an institutional investor in a primary sale, but not a security when sold behind the anonymity of a cryptocurrency exchange, or when sold in exchange for services to insiders.  This position strikes me as deeply unsatisfactory from the standpoint of regulatory consistency. No other security magically transmogrifies from a security to a non-security after it is sold more than once. It is also a manifestly incorrect application of the line of precedents relating to the first and third Howey prongs (see above) when one considers the entirety of the reasons why an XRP purchaser buys XRP tokens.  Read more: Ripple, Crypto Industry Score Partial Win in SEC Court Fight Over XRP  Issuers is the U.S. market are thus presented with two broad pathways for further development, much like in 2017 when the SEC’s Bill Hinman unwisely invented the “sufficiently decentralized” test for token issuance which launched a thousand ICOs (and was subsequently bench-slapped by District Courts across the United States).  The first path, assuming unfit-for-purpose regulations don’t change and new token issuers take advantage of this narrow (and likely incorrect ruling) to launch new programmatic token schemes, the SEC will find itself bringing enforcement actions against these schemes in two to three years, to the detriment of the American economy, investors, and innovation more broadly.  Startups following this first path should exercise extreme caution – as my colleague Stephen Palley puts it, “that order in the Ripple case is a partial summary judgment from a single district court judge. While persuasive, it’s not binding precedent on other courts and will likely be appealed and could be reversed. Don’t yolo into anything based on that decision.”  The second path is that the U.S. Congress realizes that it makes no sense for a thing to be a security in one transaction but not another, and passes laws – as the U.K. is now doing – to normalize cryptocurrency investment. It will confer a well-defined legal status on all token transactions, requiring an aggressive disclosure regime and do away with the Securities Act of 1933’s requirement that we regulate tokens with no contractual promises in the same manner as we regulate contractual instruments.  Conclusions  Ripple’s business of selling tokens should be legal in the United States, within regulatory guardrails. Currently, it isn’t.  In my view Judge Torres’ ruling holding that it is, will likely be reversed on appeal. My hope is that Congress will get its act together and decide that it’s time for cryptocurrency tokens and cryptocurrency exchanges to receive their own purpose-built disclosure and supervisory frameworks which will take cryptocurrency regulation out of the slow and contradictory hands of our courts, and the politically motivated hands of the SEC, to allow U.S. crypto business to proceed in a more laissez-faire manner, such as is permitted in jurisdictions like the United Kingdom.  My expectations of Congress are, however, quite low. I hope to be proven wrong on that point.",NEGATIVE,XRP,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | XRP,Preston J.

Despite the regulatory uncertainty, the company is well-positioned to benefit from institutional adoption. Investors might get a chance to buy the dip at $70-. Thesis Summary Coinbase Global, Inc. ( COIN ) has been on a tear in the last month, performing even better than Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). While the SEC has created some uncertainty over the legality of Coinbase’s business, it remains the best option for institutions to gain exposure to crypto. COIN has strategic partnerships with many of the key players in the industry, and it will likely benefit from the continued regulatory attack on its main competitor, Binance. It’s hard to put a price tag on COIN, but it seems quite clear that analysts are underestimating its potential if/when Bitcoin enters a new bull market. Technical analysis suggests investors might have the chance to buy the dip in COIN at around $70. Why Is Coinbase Up? Coinbase is up a whopping 94% in the last month, while Bitcoin is up a “mere” 20%. COIN price (SA) What's going on? Just last month, COIN was being charged by the SEC for operating as an unregistered securities exchange. But a lot has happened since then. Only weeks after the Coinbase and Binance lawsuit, BlackRock applied for a Bitcoin ETF, and this dramatically shifted investor sentiment: Coinbase and BTC price and events (Author's work) The BlackRock application marked quite literally the Bitcoin bottom, with Coinbase bottoming a few days prior. The fact that BlackRock is applying for an ETF is a big sign that institutions are trying to gain exposure to Bitcoin, and this is great for Coinbase, as it is one of the few crypto amps available in the US. If BlackRock ’s ETF does get approved, it will, in fact, be Coinbase who will act as the custodian . This means Coinbase would be in charge of managing and storing the Bitcoin and would, of course, receive a fee from this. But Coinbase’s ambitions go well beyond the US market. The company has a presence abroad too, and it is expanding its global footprint. A recent partnership with Bitpanda will allow Coinbase to offer institutional services in Europe. And this is all happening as Binance, Coinbase’s main competitor, is struggling to keep its presence in Europe. Binance recently exited the Dutch market as it failed to acquire a license . The company is also being investigated by French prosecutors. Binance’s loss is Coinbase’s gain, and in a space where regulation is already unclear, it’s understandable that institutions and countries will be more favourable to working with Coinbase, which is a US-listed company. Lastly, it's also worth mentioning that Ripple ( XRP-USD ) received a favourable ruling from the judge today, stating that secondary offerings of XRP, such as sales on exchanges, did not count as sales of unregistered securities. This is likely also helping bid up the price of COIN today, which was accused of doing just that. How Far Can It Go? The way I see it, Coinbase could have a lot more room to grow from here. Let’s look at the company’s revenue and EBITDA history to try and better understand its future. COIN Revenue and EBITDA margin (Macrotrends) As we can see, COIN’s revenue peaked in December of 2021 at $7.48 billion. At this point, the company also boasted an EBITDA margin of 40%. Of course, revenues and profitability collapsed as crypto entered a long and painful bear market. But with the halving due in less than 12 months, most expect Bitcoin could reach all-time highs in the next 2 years. If that’s the case, we should expect Coinbase to reach, at the very least, the same level of revenues and profitability as in 2021. Let’s assume over the next 5 years, Coinbase can do just that: 5 year DCF valuation (Finbox) As we can see, the DCF model provided by Finbox shows a fair value of $127, assuming a CAGR of 18.9% and an EBITDA margin of 33%. This, in my opinion, is the bare minimum Coinbase should be worth: Technical Analysis In terms of the technical outlook, here’s what I see: COIN TA (Author's work) My belief is that Coinbase bottomed at $33, and is now forming a five-wave impulse to the upside. Wave 1 took us to $97, and this was followed by a retracement in wave 2, which I actually told my subscribers to buy, as we approached the 61.8% retracement of the initial move up. With the latest rally, we have an impulsive structure breaking above the high in wave 1, and this is a very strong indication that a bottom is indeed in. With that said, I would now, once again, expect a pull-back and the $70 region looks like good support. This would be close to the 61.8% retracement of this move up, and we have significant volume coming in at that level, as well as support from the moving averages. Risks Some investors might be caught out chasing this rally, and there are still some risks with Coinbase moving forward. Investors should be aware that the regulatory landscape is still unclear, and this can cause a lot of volatility moving forward. Furthermore, based on Bitcoin’s previous behaviour during the halving, we could experience a sharp sell-off in the months leading up to the halving, which will take place in March 2024. Coinbase could be dragged down if Bitcoin sells off, although we have also seen how the stock can rally even without much higher BTC prices. Final Thoughts I believe Coinbase will perform very well if we enter another bull market. In fact, I think it should outperform Bitcoin. Coinbase is already the second largest exchange for retail investors, but now it stands to make a lot more money from a wave of institutional investors.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4616987-coinbase-institutional-pick-and-shovel-crypto-play?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/14859979.jpeg

42419892,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGXuf,1689284917,"Bitcoin, Ether Maintain Their 2023 Decoupling from Traditional Finance","Bitcoin and ether have decoupled sharply from traditional finance in 2023.  While maturing as uncorrelated assets, the number of addresses accumulating bitcoin and ether has increased.  If there’s one market development that may be more surprising than bitcoin’s 2023 performance, it may be its decoupling from traditional finance. Its independence from traditional finance arguably comes with both smiles and regrets.  Some investors are likely smiling over bitcoin's ability to weather macro noise, but others may be rueing its lack of participation in the periodic upsides that accompany upbeat events.  As bitcoin investors find comfort in its emergence as a non-correlated asset, they’ve also had to watch as it reacts less to global macro catalysts than its Tradfi counterparts.  Bitcoin’s correlation coefficient with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), and Nasdaq Composite has declined 50.5%, 30%, and 49.4% respectively since Jan. 1. Correlation coefficients range from -1 to 1, with the former indicating an inverse pricing relationship, and the latter indicating a direct one.  To be sure, digital asset news has been anything but non-eventful. There have been regulatory overhangs, unfounded rumors of SEC resignations, and speculation around Federal Reserve policy decisions. But outside of its reaction to BlackRock’s ETF announcement on June 15, BTC price action has been relatively lax.  Read More: BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Application Takes Surveillance to the Next Level  Until a surge above $31,7000 late Thursday – BTC’s first time above that level in a year – bitcoin had been immersed in a three-week bout of range-bound trading and volatility compression. The same has held true for ether, as investors in both assets grew content to sit on 2023 gains, while awaiting a fresh price catalyst.  Macro's Lesser Impact  At the moment, it appears that macroeconomic catalysts that move markets in general are having a lesser effect on bitcoin. Meanwhile, the decoupling hasn’t been limited to just equities.  BTC’s correlation with gold and the U.S. dollar is 0.33 and -0.23, respectively. The proximity to zero for both implies no pricing relationship at all, ironic given early perceptions of bitcoin as an inflation hedge.  Bitcoin’s most consistently positive pricing relationship has been with ether. Despite the differences in the two assets’ utility and consensus mechanism, they have traded in relative lockstep.  Bitcoin and ether’s independence hint at the maturation of the two assets, with sharp moves directly attributable to asset-specific developments.  The lack of reaction from both to Wednesday’s solid inflation report suggests that most of their investors are attempting to sift through the noise. Meanwhile, they appear to be engaging in quiet accumulation rather than rampant speculation.  Since Jan. 1, the number of bitcoin addresses with a non-zero balance has increased by approximately 9%, according to on-chain analytics firm Glassnode. For ether, unique addresses with a non-zero balance increased 11% over the same period.  For bitcoin, the figure continued to rise even as prices declined to $25,000 in May, indicating an underpinning of stable demand despite the downturns.

42419871,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGXgD,1689284787,Why Crypto Companies Are Warming to the United Arab Emirates,"On July 10, the Dubai Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) suspended BitOasis’s conditional license to engage in activities related to digital assets. This action by the Dubai regulator is representative of and lends credence to the novel approach the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and its domestic regulators have taken towards regulation of digital assets.  The UAE approach has prioritized providing regulatory clarity and guidance to entities that want to engage in activities related to digital assets – providing notice as to the types of activities are permitted and prohibited.  Bret Johanneson received his law degree from New York University and will be working as associate at a law firm in New York this fall.  In contrast, U.S. regulators, as demonstrated by the charges against Coinbase and Binance in early June, have organized around an approach that provides no advance notice to industry participants, opting instead to bring charges which rely on untested and novel legal theories. (Another example is the SEC's action against Ripple for issuing unregistered “securities,” which concluded Thursday when the judge found that XRP is a security only in certain circumstances.)  The UAE has followed a different playbook, and the digital asset industry has taken notice. CoinDesk named two UAE cities as major crypto hubs in 2023, and to a large extent industry participants are voting with their feet. Scores of companies are either relocating wholesale to the country or opening satellite offices there.  See also: Abu Dhabi: A Wealthy Middle-East Capital Bridging TradFi to Crypto | Crypto Hubs  To understand why the UAE has been able to implement such a progressive and responsive digital assets regulatory regime, look no further than the UAE form of government. In short, the UAE is made up of seven emirates, with each emirate (i.e. state) empowered to legislate on any matter not within the exclusive jurisdiction of the UAE federal government (i.e. foreign affairs, defense and security).  Each emirate is left to determine for itself how it will regulate digital assets – a situation which has fostered intrastate competition through regulation for business and investment effected through incentives, including tax breaks and designated free economic zones. Abu Dhabi and Dubai in particular have assumed leading roles in attracting digital asset industry participants to their jurisdictions.  Abu Dhabi and Dubai have each devised comprehensive regulatory frameworks for the regulation of digital assets which address many of the pitfalls of other jurisdictions’ approaches, not least of which involves defining the subject of regulation, digital assets.  For example, the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) has provided clear guidance for classification and treatment of various digital assets, clearly distinguishing between “virtual assets” like Ethereum and Bitcoin, ""digital securities"" and other tokens which provide different types of utility. Like the ADGM, VARA has defined digital assets with specificity, though opting for a more expansive taxonomy – defining “virtual assets” as “any digital representation of value that may be digitally traded, transferred, or used as an exchange or payment tool, or for investment purposes,” with VARA reserving the right to police the bounds of that definition at its discretion.  These policies, while different, stand in stark contrast with the U.S. approach – characterized by agency turf wars over who gets to regulate what, with industry participants stuck in the crossfire.  Another complaint lobbed by industry participants towards U.S. regulators has been lack of clarity around registration. On this front the ADGM and VARA have also distinguished themselves, providing clear roadmaps regarding registration and licensure requirements for digital asset businesses looking to engage in regulated activities.  See also: Dubai: Launching a Crypto Regulatory Arm to Wrestle With theh World | Crypto Hubs  To be authorized to carry on an ADGM-approved digital assets business, a business simply needs to apply for a Financial Services Permission and follow applicable laws. Those seeking a license to conduct business as a VARA-approved “Virtual Asset Service Provider” adhere to a similar process.  As demonstrated by VARA’s suspension of BitOasis’s condition license for the minimum viable product of its exchange, these permissive frameworks are not merely a blank check for industry participants to operate with impunity, and do have bite.  However, even with BitOasis and others’ enforcement actions in mind, ADGM and VARA’s straightforward regimes for registration are far and away preferable to complying with the SEC’s guidance on paths to registration, which is, by contrast, downright impenetrable.  The digital assets industry is in a constant state of flux, with years taking place in weeks, and norm-breaking a norm in and of itself – such an industry deserves dynamic regulation to match. The UAE seems to be on its way to achieving such a goal – whether the U.S. can match their efforts is to be determined.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB, Bret Johanneson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/07/13/why-crypto-companies-are-warming-to-the-united-arab-emirates,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/aa7695ad4f6e23063b400a36f7b53fe14ead6aae-4000x2250.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Blockchain data by Arkham Intelligence shows that the firm transferred at least $64 million of cryptocurrencies to a wallet labeled as “Celsius Network: OTC” from the company’s “Fireblocks Custody” wallet in multiple transactions Thursday afternoon.  The largest transactions were $19.3 million in Chainlink’s LINK token, $14.7 million in Polygon’s MATIC, $7.5 million in AAVE and $6.1 million in SNX. Other notable tokens transferred include Uniswap’s UNI, Binance’s BNB and 1INCH.  The transactions happened after the company received approval from the U.S. judge overseeing the bankruptcy case to liquidate its altcoin stash for BTC and ETH starting July 1. Celsius filed for bankruptcy protection in July 2022 after halting withdrawals due to a shortage of customer funds. Alex Mashinsky, ex-CEO of the company, was arrested Thursday on seven counts, including securities fraud, commodities fraud and wire fraud by the Department of Justice (DOJ).  The court's recent decision means that Celsius could potentially sell $170 million of smaller cryptocurrencies, based on court documents. The conversion could apply significant pressure on the markets of smaller tokens, crypto analytics firm Kaiko said in a report earlier this week.  “The market impact could be significant, especially considering liquidity for these tokens has dropped over the past year,” Kaiko said.",NEGATIVE,AAVE | LINK | MATIC,AAVE | ALTCOIN | LINK | MARKET | MATIC,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/13/celsius-moves-64m-in-link-matic-aave-and-altcoins-following-court-permission-to-sell-tokens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1ce38ae287a7f8503a75b6d06897321bbe2acc6b-1438x666.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42419873,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGXhF,1689281832,Who Are the 81 Recipients of Snowfro’s Latest Squiggle Mint?,"After a non-fungible token (NFT) collection concludes a mint and its value skyrockets on the secondary market, any legitimate creator won’t abandon their project. They might mint more of the original NFT to generate sales or introduce a derivative token to grow a project’s community while keeping holders engaged, like when NimBuds creator Bryan Brinkman unveiled NimTeens.  But why would an artist behind a popular collection mint more of their NFTs that aren’t for sale? That’s exactly what generative art platform Art Blocks founder and CEO Erick Calderon, commonly known as “Snowfro,” did with his flagship Chromie Squiggle NFT collection.  On Tuesday, Calderon tweeted that he would be minting 81 additional Chromie Squiggles to give to individuals and communities across the Web3 industry and beyond that he had a personal connection to. From past mentors to digital art galleries, he shared that all of the NFTs had been earmarked for specific recipients ahead of the mint.  Chromie Squiggles, which opened as Art Blocks’ genesis collection in November 2020, only minted 9,040 of its 10,000 cap – leaving almost 1,000 for Calderon to mint over time. As of writing, there are 9,868 now minted and the collection has done 69,426 ETH, or over $138 million, in trading volume according to data on OpenSea.  As he approaches the collection’s cap, Calderon told CoinDesk he is driven to give back to the many collectors and artists that have supported him in the past two years. With the floor price of a Squiggle hovering just over 10 ETH (or almost $20,000) on OpenSea as of writing, this is no small gesture of appreciation.  “This is the final opportunity for a Squiggle to be used in service of recognizing the community members and friends who have supported Art Blocks in a meaningful way,” said Calderon. “It feels like the right conclusion for this project.”  Ahead of the mint Tuesday night, Calderon tweeted that he would generate the Squiggles on-chain in two separate batches. The first batch of Squiggles will be given designated community members and advocates for his career outside of Web3, including his “executive coach.”  “There are less Squiggles than there are people that deserve them much less want them,” Calderon told CoinDesk. “I make a note when someone does something particularly admirable and add them to the list.”  He also said on Twitter that he is planning to donate 10 Squiggles to the New-York based NFT gallery Venus Over Manhattan, and five to decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) SquiggleDAO, a community of Squiggle holders that Calderon told CoinDesk has been supportive of his work and started initiatives such as the SquigSig, a Squiggle email signature.  Calderon told CoinDesk that he is giving one Squiggle to the charitable organization Maya Spirits, an group that helps fund education in Mexico through Web3.  “When I give Squiggles to organizations like that one, I always tell them if they want they can sell it to raise funds for their efforts, or keep it as a sort of mascot for the org to share with the members,” Calderon said.  He also noted that he will be participating in an art swap, trading two Squiggles and a CryptoPunk NFT for an artwork from a meaningful artist and friend.  Calderon tweeted that the second batch of the mint would be donated to each of his employees at ArtBlocks as a token of his gratitude for the “support of the wonderful people” he works with daily. He also said that next week, he would be gifting 10 Squiggles to FlamingoDAO, an exclusive art curation community that was an early supporter of Calderon and Art Blocks and owns hundreds of Squiggles.  While Calderon said that he previously intended to mint 100 Squiggles for his children, he noted that he wanted to pivot the final mints towards supporting people “aligned with the original intent of the project.”  Calderon has previously gifted and donated Squiggles to various individuals and organizations within and outside of the Web3 community. In April, he minted 30 Squiggles for family and friends, a digital art fund and contest winners.  While none of the additional Squiggles minted are for sale, Art Blocks has made efforts to reward its collectors for their participation in its digital art ecosystem in the past. In 2022, artist Alexis André released his generative art Friendship Bracelet collection, which were free to mint for holders of any prior Art Blocks collection.",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/07/13/who-are-the-81-recipients-of-snowfros-latest-squiggle-mint,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b7e7d264fc34131a5b88e3715a9567c40f63359d-1217x632.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As part of this update, Polygon Labs will introduce a new token, ""POL,"" which will replace the current MATIC token on a 1 to 1 basis. This change is expected to dramatically shift the economic purpose of Polygon's native token, potentially impacting its utility. Those who have followed my work on Seeking Alpha may recall Polygon ( MATIC-USD ) was my top crypto bull pick for 2023 back in December . It's a coin that I've covered a handful of times and is one of the larger positions in my cryptocurrency portfolio. To briefly summarize what I've liked about Polygon's MATIC token: Supply capped coin, of which 93% is already circulating It has historically been used to pay transaction fees on what I believe to be the leading Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) scaling network The blockchain has onboarded non-crypto native users through products like Reddit Avatars and Starbuck ( SBUX ) Odyssey Throughout much of June and July, Polygon Labs, the core developer behind the Polygon blockchains, has been rolling out plans for what the team has dubbed ""Polygon 2.0."" In my last article covering Polygon in late-June, I focused on Polygon Labs' plan to transition the network's main chain to a zkEVM Validium blockchain. At that time, what we didn't know was the impact this move might have on the utility of Polygon's MATIC token. However, this announcement came just a few months after Polygon Labs launched a separate zkEVM that doesn't utilize MATIC as the gas fee token of the chain. We now know much more about how MATIC fits in the Polygon 2.0 transition, and I don't believe it's a stretch to say there will be a significant shift in the economic model of Polygon's native token. MATIC Deprecation, POL is Born On July 13th, Polygon Labs announced it will be implementing a new token as part of the planned Polygon 2.0 relaunch. This new token, which will carry the ticker symbol ""POL,"" will replace MATIC on a 1 to 1 basis according to Polygon Labs. Holders of the current MATIC token will essentially deposit their MATIC tokens into a smart contract and then receive the POL token in return. Because this does require action at the individual user level on-chain, the window for POL redemption will be 4 years or longer, according to Polygon Labs. With the proposed end of MATIC and start of POL, we also get an update to the token economics of the new POL coin. In the table below, I've laid out some of the relevant changes for the new native Polygon coin: MATIC POL Token Supply 10 Billion Capped 10 Billion, 2% Annual Emission Gas Fee Utility Yes on PoS Chain Yes on PoS Chain, No on zkEVM/supernets Source: Polygon Labs With the launch of POL, the 10 billion native token supply cap will be over. The 2% annual emission rate is split 50/50 between validator rewards and a newly proposed Polygon ""Community Treasury."" In the POL white paper that accompanied the Polygon Labs blog post, the authors went into detail about why they feel the change to supply cap is necessary going forward: The rationale for the proposed emission and the emission rates is that the Polygon ecosystem and Web3 in general will need time to mature and reach mainstream adoption. Based on the historical Internet and computing platforms adoption cycles, the maturity phase could be realistically expected to happen in about 10-15 years. During that period, the ecosystem will need economic support. The Polygon founders appear to concede that transaction fees alone won't be able to make validation economically viable for several years. This is not unusual for public blockchain networks, but it is interesting nonetheless. They went on to mention that a 2% rate of inflation is roughly inline with what Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has currently through block reward coin issuance - though that number is programmed to decline to nothing in a century. The authors then hypothesize a future where the community votes to either reduce or eliminate ongoing emissions when the network is mature enough to sustain itself without new supply distributions. Importantly, the white paper notes that community voters cannot decide to increase the emission rate. Gas & Future Utility As I pointed out in March, MATIC/POL will not be used as the gas payment coin for the newly launched Polygon zkEVM. However, according to the FAQ section from the POL tokenomic announcement, the proof-of-stake chain will continue to use POL as its gas payment currency going forward. This is a good sign for the token's utility on the legacy chain. However, what remains unclear is where the incremental growth in the Polygon ecosystem will be. Polygon previously announced the development of ""supernets,"" or customizable 2nd layer chains, built within the Polygon ecosystem. If the growth in the Polygon ecosystem happens off of the PoS chain and instead takes place on the new zkEVM or the upcoming supernets, POL's utility as a gas payment token will be diminished. That's because there is no guarantee POL will be used as the gas token on any of the proposed Polygon supernets. Supernet developers have the ability to manage their own native tokens and use those for transaction payment rather than POL. There is an incentive for supernet developers to use their own token for payments because doing so allows them to control transaction costs at a fixed rate or abstract them away from the end user all together by paying the fees for them. This seems to be what Polygon Labs is expecting: 10 Year Growth Model (POL White Paper) In the POL white paper, the authors modeled the ten-year growth potential for both public chains and supernets within the ecosystem. They noted different levels of interest for each currently: Additionally, it is noticeable that the trend of interest in Supernets is stronger in relative terms than the one for public chains. Assuming they are correct, my read on this is POL will end up used less for transaction payment and more for staking and validation rewards. This is where the developers are assuming the value proposition from staking and validation will counteract the potential loss of gas payment utility, particularly on the supernets. Given the customization options of the supernets, one of the theoretical justifications for holding POL is for the ability to validate multiple chains while generating rewards from each individual chain. This gives chain operators the ability to pay validators essentially however they wish; whether that be in their own chain's native token or something else. This would be a tertiary reward on top of the programmed emission from validation and the transaction fees from the main chain. Risks One of the questions in the FAQ is whether this is a response to recent developments in the regulatory environment. It wasn't explicitly mentioned, but one can realistically assume the team is referring to the SEC's recent designation of MATIC as an unregistered security. Polygon Labs denies that this is a response to that, and claims work on this proposal began a year ago. But I will say optically it's interesting timing that MATIC is now going away roughly a month after the SEC labeled it a security. I'll allow readers to make their own judgement on that. Investor Takeaways Developing a cryptocurrency portfolio is far from straightforward. Since I started personally buying and covering these assets for Seeking Alpha, my goal has been to allocate to tokens and ideas that I personally believe have a fundamental value through utility. To me, MATIC's utility on the PoS chain was obvious. I'm much less convinced about POL going forward. That said, I don't necessarily see selling MATIC today to be the proper course of action. In my view, the price can still head much higher from here. But this is no longer a coin that I can confidently say I expect to outperform BTC or ETH going forward. Pure staking coins and governance tokens are much less interesting to me than utility coins. Bitcoin is necessary for transaction payments. Ethereum is necessary for transaction payments. When the utility for a coin becomes a bit more obfuscated, as I believe to be the case for POL longer term, coin performance can tend to become more about ""number go up"" than about organic demand. For MATIC, the demand currently comes from a necessity to participate at the user level. For POL, that necessity to participate may skew away from the user and more to the validator level only. We don't know for sure yet. It's going to come down to where the growth is in the Polygon ecosystem.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH | MATIC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | ICO | MATIC,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4616968-polygon-2-0-matic-tokenomic-update?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/14857182.jpeg

42419880,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGXlN,1689279358,Web3 VC Shima Capital Didn’t Slow Strategy for Crypto Winter,"Shima Capital has backed more than 100 early-stage companies in the two years since its founding, and the venture-capital firm hasn't slowed down amid the recent industry turmoil.  “We see the trends today in a barbell layout,” said Shima Capital founder Yida Gao during an interview with CoinDesk.  The traditional finance veteran who started Shima Capital in 2021 outlined his firm’s view of the current, bear-market constrained crypto venture capital landscape.  “Infrastructure deals typically hold up well in crypto winter because they usually take longer to build the projects and also require much more talent, which is cheaper now,” said Gao. “On the other end of the barbell, we see that consumer apps, specifically gaming, continue to make up a large portion of our portfolio,” he continued. “People play more games in bear markets and, more importantly, tokenomics and digital assets fit nicely into a well-designed game.”  Shima Capital's investments have generally ranged between $500,000 to $2 million, Gao said. Last August, Shima announced its first venture capital fund with $200 million committed to backing Web3 projects. Investors in the fund included crypto-focused venture capital firm Dragonfly and hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman.  Investment strategy  Gao previously served as an investment banker at Morgan Stanley before becoming a technology investor at New Enterprise Associates, a venture capital firm with more than $25 billion in assets under management. Gao became personally interested in cryptocurrencies and came to recognize a vacancy in the venture capital space.  “We saw that established crypto funds had gotten so large they no longer funded the earliest stages of Web3 companies,” explained Gao. “And angels and smaller funds didn’t have the resources to provide full support to founders. We started Shima to fill that gap for Web3 founders at the earliest stages of their projects lives.”  Shima portfolio companies include analytics firm Web3Go, blockchain game company Intuition and decentralized finance startup Maverick Protocol. The early-stage focus provides some insulation from market-driven valuation volatility since the valuations are already low. Shima mainly focuses on token investments. There’s typically a two- to four-year lockup for the tokens they invest into. The average hold period is around four years.  More than half of Shima’s team is devoted to operational support through a proprietary platform for portfolio customers who can receive assistance with talent acquisition, community building, tokenomics and more. The constrained venture capital landscape and the existence of the portfolio platform inspired Shima to move into even earlier stages of investments, incubating a select number of projects from the earliest stages.  Bank insecurity  The long crypto bear market had already made things difficult for venture capitalists and the implosion of centralized exchange FTX created an additional multibillion dollar turbulence in the market. As the industry tried to find footing, yet another blow hit when a trio of crypto-friendly banks (Silvergate, Signature and Silicon Valley) collapsed.  Shima Capital didn’t have material exposure to those banks, though a few portfolio companies were affected at “relatively small amounts,” said Gao. The firm has always tried to conduct deep due diligence both for investments and third-party partners like banks, but that strategy has strengthened this year.  “We probably have more banking relationships now than contemplated when first starting the fund in order to mitigate risks like these in the future,” noted Gao. “Although it’s harder for Web3 companies to acquire bank accounts these days, we also encourage our founders to take the time to diversify their funds across multisig wallets, bank accounts, and brokerage accounts if possible.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/07/13/web3-vc-shima-capital-didnt-slow-strategy-for-crypto-winter,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3309624735422cbe517ffb9f285d3fe83668f2ea-1496x1122.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419891,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGXrZ,1689278554,"Coinbase, SEC Spar Over Definition of Securities, Nature of Staking in First Court Hearing","NEW YORK – A judge’s questions offered hints of how she is looking at Coinbase’s legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) during the first hearing in the case.  In a pre-motion hearing Thursday that lasted over two hours – including a brief recess where both parties huddled to digest a federal judge’s ruling on the SEC’s separate Ripple lawsuit – Judge Katherine Polka Faila, of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, questioned both sides on a range of topics, from the definition of staking to Coinbase’s IPO filings to the use of the major questions doctrine.  The case is being closely watched not only because it pits the securities regulator for the world’s largest economy against one of the oldest and best-known companies in the crypto industry, but also because it could establish precedent for securities law, market structure and the regulatory powers of the SEC.  Read More: Sale of XRP on Exchanges Not Investment Contracts, Court Rules in SEC Case Against Ripple  At times, Judge Faila showed skepticism toward the SEC’s messaging, saying there was “tension” between the Commission’s position that the agency was not looking to regulate crypto in its entirety in its lawsuit against the crypto exchange and its efforts to enforce alleged securities laws violations.  “The SEC is not looking to regulate all crypto in this country. We regulate conduct,” said the SEC’s counsel, when asked to contextualize prior testimony from Chairman Gary Gensler where Gensler appeared to suggest the SEC did not have the authority to regulate crypto assets.  “It seems like to consider which conduct to regulate, you’d have to consider what to regulate,” said Judge Faila to the SEC’s counsel.  When asked about the Commission’s position on bitcoin and ether, the SEC counsel said that bitcoin was not a security and its status was not in question. “I do not believe the Commission has spoken on Ether,” he added.  Discussion also touched on the Commission’s prior approval of Coinbase’s S-1, a SEC registration form required for a company to conduct an initial public offering (IPO). Coinbase lawyers argued that several of the crypto assets the SEC named in its suit as unregistered securities had been trading on the platform at the time the SEC approved Coinbase’s S-1.  “Simply because the SEC allows a company to go public does not mean it’s a blessing,” said the SEC counsel.  “Was it within the power of the SEC to have [Coinbase] register as a securities exchange? I think so,” replied Judge Faila. “It’s not crazy for Coinbase to think what they were doing was OK based on the issuance of the S-1.”  The SEC and Coinbase also presented different definitions of Coinbase’s staking program, with Coinbase’s counsel arguing that staking services do not qualify as an investment contract.  Coinbase lawyers said staking was equivalent to “payment for a service” and that there was “no risk to the staking party of loss,” rendering staking a services contract, similar to an IT function.  However, a SEC lawyer argued that “IT services can be entrepreneurial,” thereby making staking an investment function.  Both sides also discussed the major questions doctrine, which could be used by Coinbase to argue that the SEC is overstepping its regulatory authority. Most recently, the U. S. Supreme Court cited the major questions doctrine to strike down President Biden’s plan for student loan forgiveness.  “Has the [SEC] exercised authority in the way it has previously exercised authority? We think no,” said a member of the Coinbase counsel team. “We think it would be an expansion of authority.”  Judge Faila concluded the hearing by asking both sides to come up with a “realistic schedule” that took into consideration her “very busy” docket that extended into October. Coinbase has so far moved fast by filing a rapid response to the SEC’s original complaint, leading to an earlier-than-expected first hearing date. Both sides were also strongly encouraged to keep to page limits on materials and to keep the use of footnotes in such materials “reasonable.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/07/13/coinbase-sec-spar-over-definition-of-securities-nature-of-staking-in-first-court-hearing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5791b45398fc8d1f7bc3ab9c870d193d111d1e4a-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, the court found that Ripple’s institutional sales of XRP did constitute an unregistered offer and sale of investment contracts in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act. According to analyst Adam Cochran, the ruling is mostly excellent news for Ripple and XRP, providing greater regulatory clarity and paving the way for increased cryptocurrency adoption. The court found that sales to users via exchanges “were fine” if they were conducted through order books and not ICO/IEO/Launchpad-like platforms. Other activities, such as bounties, investments in others using XRP, grants using XRP, and transfers to executives in XRP, were also not considered securities. Related Reading: Polygon Upgrade Proposal Pushes Price Over 5%, Is It Too Late To Buy? XRP has long been considered one of the more centralized foundations in cryptocurrency, with a key figurehead and standard sales via exchanges. According to Cochran, the court’s ruling suggests that if XRP is not a security, then neither are Bitcoin or Ethereum. Furthermore, Cochran believes The ruling is also a win for exchanges, as it suggests that all selling will flow through public order books again, with no more billions in convertible funding rounds early on. This could make it easier for investors to trade XRP and other cryptocurrencies on regulated exchanges. XRP Price Rises As Ripple Wins Legal Battle Against SEC The recent ruling in favor of Ripple represents a significant legal victory, and the market has positively received the news. XRP’s price has notably increased since the ruling, with the cryptocurrency experiencing gains of over 33% in the hours following the announcement. What’s more, Institutional investors have been cautious about investing in XRP due to the ongoing legal battle with the SEC, which has created uncertainty around the regulatory status of the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Circle To Lay Off Staff And Refocus On Core Activities The recent ruling provides greater clarity and certainty, which could help to alleviate some of these concerns and make XRP a more attractive option for institutional investors. As of the time of writing, XRP has reached a significant milestone by hitting the $0.6324 mark, which has not been achieved since May 2022. This new yearly high is a positive indication of the cryptocurrency’s continued uptrend. The ADX, a technical indicator that measures the strength of a trend, is currently spiking to the upside, suggesting a potential continuation of XRP’s upward momentum. XRP’s squeeze-bear momentum indicator also shows the beginning of a significant move to the upside, indicating that the cryptocurrency may be poised for further gains. These factors could be the perfect ingredients for XRP to reach the $1 mark. Despite the cryptocurrency’s optimism, XRP faces two major resistance levels shortly. The first resistance wall is $0.7769, which could be the first obstacle to the $1 mark. The second, more challenging wall is the $0.8627 level, which has not been reached since the first quarter of 2022. This surge in price marks a significant turnaround for XRP, which had been struggling in the wake of the SEC lawsuit. The ruling is likely to positively impact investor sentiment, as it provides greater clarity and certainty around the regulatory status of the token.

42419877,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGXfB,1689276342,Nexo in Court With a Co-Founder Over $12M in Missing Assets,"Troubled crypto trading platform Nexo is fighting in a U.K. court with a co-founder over $12 million in missing assets, CoinDesk learned from a court document recently shared with us. It sheds light on previously unknown details of interactions between Nexo’s founders.  According to the court judgment by the London’s High Court on June 27, Nexo and its co-founder Georgi Shulev are disputing the whereabouts of a Ledger hardware wallet containing some of the company’s crypto holdings. Shulev, who is a son of Bulgaria’s former deputy prime minister Lydia Shuleva, founded the company in 2019 together with Antoni Trenchev, who used to be a member of Bulgaria’s parliament, and other co-founders, Kosta Kantchev and Kalin Metodiev. Shulev left the company, which provides crypto trading, lending and custody services, in 2019. The legal dispute has been ongoing since 2022.  Earlier, the parties had been fighting for control over a BitMEX account that was opened by Shulev in his name but on behalf of Nexo, according to the filing. Since Shulev was terminated by Nexo in 2019, and lost access to his corporate email, he and Nexo have both been trying to take over the account.  BitMEX ended up freezing the funds but ultimately releasing them to Nexo after the court decision last August. However, Nexo said it lost around $7.9 million in value of its crypto as the prices declined significantly since September 2019, when the account was frozen.  Now, Nexo and Shulev are arguing about another part of the firm’s crypto treasury, which ended up either in Shulev’s hands or in the custody of Bulgaria’s law enforcement, depending on whose version of the story you believe.  According to the document, the wallet contained over $12 million in crypto, which is now missing.  Founders’ fight  Shulev and Nexo have been in conflict since September 2019, when Shulev was terminated in his role of Nexo’s managing partner by the board. Following this, Shulev tried to get compensation for his Nexo shares that were denied to him, according to reports. Access to Nexo’s crypto could have become a bargaining chip in those negotiations, the new court document shows.  In 2020, Shulev reportedly wrote an email to the asset management company Zeus Capital saying Nexo co-founder Kosta Kantchev had wrongfully denied Shulev shares in Nexo he had been promised. Shulev also accused his former employer of abusing its users’ trust, according to a reproduction of the email by the ranking firm BestBrokers. In a comment to the online publication Invezz, Nexo brushed off Shulev’s accusations.  As Nexo and Shulev had been fighting over the BitMEX account, they came to a settlement that Shulev should return assets belonging to Nexo in his custody and receive $1 million in exchange.  On 1 July 2021, according to the recent court filing, someone moved 45,232,012 in Nexo’s own tokens (NEXO) from the wallet Nexo claimed was controlled by Shulev to a new wallet, and Nexo received an email with the seed phrase for the new wallet from an address fill5645@protonmail.com.  Shulev did not confirm that it was him who sent the tokens but demanded the first of the five installments of the $1 million payment promised to him (the whole sum was slated to be paid over 30 months).  Nexo did not proceed with the payment, demanding Shulev return other crypto he owed it first, according to the document. Shulev insisted on getting his money first. The parties have been in a gridlock ever since.  Trenchev denied he meant to personally threaten Shulev  According to the document reviewed by CoinDesk, Shulev complained to the court that he was forced to sign the settlement agreement together with other documents needed for him and Nexo to part ways. He claimed that Nexo CEO Antoni Trenchev hurried him and even threatened him.  “Don’t worry about us – we will be fine. However, I’m not so sure about you, the people around you and any startups, which are about to potentially take off,” Trenchev reportedly wrote in an email to Shulev, according to his testimony.  Later, Trenchev called Shulev by phone and said, according to Shulev, that the Nexo team knew Shulev’s fiancée was pregnant and her business dealings had been under investigation (it’s not clear what exactly investigation was meant).  “You know who we are and that we have the money. You know how things are done in Bulgaria. Our patience is already over, so if you do not agree to sign the agreement I would not be very calm about your family and yourself,” Trenchev said during the phone call, according to Shulev’s testimony.  Trenchev disputed the wording of his remarks cited by Shulev and denied he meant to personally threaten Shulev, according to the court document.  Neither Trenchev nor Shulev responded to CoinDesk’s request for comment.  The missing Ledger  The dispute is full of confusing and contradictory claims.  Nexo told the court that Shulev retained access to a stash of 17.3 BTC, 27,000 USDT, 4.5 ETH and significant amounts of BNB, XRP and XML, the court document reads.  The assets, according to both sides of the case, were stored on a missing Ledger hardware wallet. Neither Shulev nor Nexo admit possessing the device.  In July 2021, Nexo suggested that Shulev deduct the $1 million settlement from the amount of crypto in his custody, and return the rest. In response, Shulev suggested sending “any residue assets” to an escrow agent, who would also receive the $1 million compensation owed from Nexo and then finish the exchange. However, after Nexo asked for specifics on this arrangement, Shulev went silent until March 2022, the court document said.  During the court hearings in April 2022, Shulev said he did not have access to those assets. Nexo pointed out that the NEXO tokens the firm received previously came from the same Ethereum blockchain address that contained some other tokens due to be returned: ETH, USDT, USDC and BNB. Then, Shulev denied it was him who sent the tokens.  CoinDesk located an address that fits the description of the wallet in question. It still contains around $217,800 worth of BNB.  “In a post-hearing note dated 13 June 2022, Mr Shulev took the same position: not denying that the Nexo Tokens were transferred, but denying that it was he who made the transfer,” the judge wrote.  According to Nexo, the company set up a Ledger wallet for its funds, which Shulev controlled and took with him as he left Nexo in 2019. Shulev maintains that he left the device in Nexo’s office and had no control over the funds.  In the meantime, other issues at Nexo complicated the case. In January, it became known that the company had been investigated by authorities in Bulgaria on suspicion of money laundering, tax offenses, banking without a license and computer fraud, CoinDesk reported earlier.  In testimony this April, Shulev told the court that after the Nexo office was searched, he was questioned by the Bulgarian National Investigation Service as a former employee. He said he volunteered to provide a PIN code for Nexo’s Ledger wallet to the investigators on March 21, 2023, and on March 31, seven of the nine cryptocurrencies stored on the device were transferred to newly created wallets.  Therefore, the crypto is now in the investigator’s custody and Shulev cannot transfer it to Nexo, he said. That story did not convince the judge, who wrote that Shulev was “clearly in control” of the assets in question and “was the party in breach of contract.”  The parties are now waiting for a trial.

14854281,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542601,1689274843,Ripple Eyes Tokenized Assets Sector As It Expects Market Cap To Reach $30 Trillion,"Ripple is best known for its XRP cryptocurrency and global payments network, but it is now setting its sights on the tokenized assets market. In its 2023 New Value report, the company believes blockchain technology can unlock trillions of dollars of value in the global financial system by tokenizing real-world assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate. Ripple Wants To Get In On The Action Tokenized digital representation of assets like stocks, bonds, real estate, art, and commodities provide more efficiency, liquidity, and accessibility on DeFi protocols. And Ripple has big plans for the tokenized assets market. Related Reading: Polygon Upgrade Proposal Pushes Price Over 5%, Is It Too Late To Buy? The company believes that the tokenization of global illiquid assets could be a $16 trillion business opportunity by 2030. So to position itself, Ripple is building tools and services for tokenizing assets and facilitating blockchain-based trading. Earlier this month, the company’s CBDC advisor, Anthony Welfare, posted on Twitter that Ripple’s CBDC team is focusing on real-world use cases for a CBDC or stablecoin on Ripple’s CBDC Platform. This will allow users to tokenize real estate as collateral for loans. Recently, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority invited Ripple Labs to participate in a pilot initiative for the tokenization of real estate assets. According to the company, its CBDC Platform was selected to assist the HKMA in creating a tokenization solution that records e-HKD real estate transactions on a secure and private ledger using its CBDC Platform – a new private ledger distinct from the XRP Ledger. Coincidentally, Ripple is not the only entity seeing growth in this niche of the industry. According to the Boston Consulting Group, tokenized illiquid assets can reach $16.1 trillion by 2030. Around 72% of finance decision-makers expect to explore tokenization as a way to drive innovation over the next three years. A survey of 300+ global institutional clients by Celent showed reported 97% of respondents agree that tokenization will revolutionize asset management and would be good for the industry. XRP Standing Strong Ripple has faced uncertainty in the past due to an ongoing legal battle with the SEC. Despite the unclear regulatory environment, Ripple continues expanding into new areas, like the tokenized assets sector. Today, Ripple secured another win as United States District Judge Analisa Torres ruled in partial favor of Ripple, saying that XRP sales on public cryptocurrency exchanges were not offers of securities under the law. Related Reading: Circle To Lay Off Staff And Refocus On Core Activities However, the judge also remarked that Ripple Labs Inc. violated federal securities legislation in its sales of XRP directly to major investors, and a jury must decide the involvement of CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Chairman Chris Larsen.

42419908,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGZuX,1689272971,Why Did Celsius Go Up in Flames? Alex Mashinsky Built Celsius a House of Cards,"The list of alleged lies from former Celsius Network Chief Executive and co-founder Alex Mashinsky is long. And if the lawsuits filed by multiple U.S. agencies Thursday are to be believed, Mashinsky’s campaign of deception – intended to entice users to treat the now bankrupt crypto lending firm like a bank – started at the very beginning.  Mashinsky, along with Celsius’ ex-chief revenue officer Roni Cohen-Pavon, were charged Thursday with fraud by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). The company is also being sued for violating finance laws by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and misleading investors by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), among other charges. Mashinsky was taken into police custody Thursday.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  In total the DOJ charged Mashinsky on seven counts, including securities, commodities and wire fraud and several conspiracy-related allegations. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which sued Celsius for a litany of material misrepresentations, announced it settled with the company in a deal that will “permanently ban it from handling consumers’ assets.” Mashinsky, along with former executives Shlomi Daniel Leon and Hanoch “Nuke” Goldstein, did not agree to the $4.7 billion FTC settlement (one of the largest in FTC history).  Celsius, founded during the initial coin offering (ICO) boom of 2017, was basically a reckless investment firm that misrepresented itself as a kind of “neo-bank” from the start. It was funded almost entirely by customer deposits, which it gambled and lost racking up an over billion dollar deficit by the time it filed for bankruptcy in July, 2022. That is, aside from the $32 million earned from a public sale of CEL, the platform’s “native token.”  See also: What Crypto Lender Celsius Isn't Telling Depositors (2020)  Tellingly, according to the CFTC, Mashinsky lied about the ICO too, falsely telling multiple media sources that Celsius actually raised $50 million.  Mashinsky, who claims to have created the Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), a precursor to ride-sharing app Uber, was known in the crypto community for his combative attitude. He would redress accusations of fraud and misconduct head on, even responding to small time Twitter accounts. He told the world he was coming for the banks, as if he were waging a kind of crusade others could join by “unbanking” themselves using his platform.  And he offered incentives. Celsius portrayed itself as a zero-risk lending platform where people could store their wealth, and advertised 18% yields on deposits to attract customers (the FTC alleged most users received far less than that, even well before withdrawals were permanently frozen). During weekly hour-long AMAs (aka “ask Mashinsky anything”), according to the regulators’ complaints, Mashinsky lied about an insurance policy – at times stretching the truth to say it had $750 million in coverage for each client.  All of this was meant to paint a picture of Celsius as a new type of financial institution for the new digital age. Over the course of his 1,000+ hours of AMA footage, Mashinsky frequently discussed the risks of “fractional reserve banking,” and also of self-custodying your own crypto. Between the old world of traditional finance and the emerging world of blockchain was Celsius, which was misleadingly represented as a trustworthy, responsible steward of funds.  It was a castle made of sand. According to the FTC, almost everything Mashinsky said to attract customers was false. He said customers would keep legal ownership over the crypto they deposited. Instead, Celsius pooled all its customers’ funds in an “omnibus account,” which was treated as a slush fund. Many former Celsius users are now “unsecured lenders,” hoping to receive back pennies on the dollar in the company’s bankruptcy process.  Mashinsky said Celsius customers would be able to withdraw anytime, but even before the company froze withdrawals, there were countless examples of people having to wait days to receive back their funds.  According to the court filings, Celsius employees spoke up as early as 2019 about the firm’s financial losses and inability to keep track of users’ funds (Celsius did not keep records of intracompany transfers until 2021). The company was losing money paying out insane yields meant to attract new investors and keep assets on the platform, the only way to keep the scam going.  See also: Custodian Prime Trust Cuts Ties With Crypto Lender Celsius (2021)  Celsius made Mashinsky and his co-founders Leon and Goldstein millionaires many times over. The company was ultimately brought down by the market crash precipitated by the collapse of the algorithmic stablecoin UST, but at almost no point was it a functioning business, the complaints show. At the very center of its business was a fraud: Celsius executives were making unsecured loans using customer funds and lying about it, as ex-CoinDesk reporter Nate DiCamillo found in 2020.  That they lost money on their outlays (over $1.7 billion in total), that they stupidly found themselves in a position of having to buy CEL on the open market to pay user rewards, that they speculated in decentralized finance (DeFi) expecting to win is almost besides the point. These were incompetent, inveterate gamblers, the complaints show. Worse, they ushered unknowing customers into a sand trap, leaving the ability to deposit funds on Celsius open after withdrawals were shut down and after taking their own money off the platform, the court documents allege.  It's possible Mashinsky believed his own hype, that he thought he could turn around a struggling company by expanding out of its problems or making a few lucky trades. It wouldn't be the first company to try to fake it until it makes it. But if you're going to build a replacement for banks, you better damn well be sure it's secure – and Celsius was a house of cards.

Judge Analisa Torres ruled in favor of Ripple in a case originally initiated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2020. Related Reading: Circle To Lay Off Staff And Refocus On Core Activities In recently filed documents on July 13, Judge Torres issued a summary judgment, decisively supporting payment company Ripple and its claim over the SEC. The judgment affirms that XRP token sales made by the payment company, at the center of the case, are not classified as a security. The decision immediately impacted the XRP price, which surged over 35% in the wake of the ruling. The ruling cleared a substantial part of Ripple’s operations from being targeted by the SEC’s crackdown. The court’s decision acknowledged that the Programmatic Sales and sales made by Ripple executives Chris Larsen and Brad Garlinghouse do not qualify as investment contracts. However, the ruling only partially resolves the legal dispute with the SEC. The court has invalidated the investment contract designation for Programmatic Sales and other forms of distributions, but other items remain disputed. The value of XRP has surged from $0.45 to $0.62. This price surge has caused XRP to reach a yearly high. The coin attained this price level in early May of the preceding year. XRP Price Analysis: One-Day Chart On the daily chart, XRP has experienced an impressive 34% increase, trading at $0.62. Over the week, XRP has gained nearly 30%. However, as of the time of writing, the token was considered oversold. It suggests that a price retracement may be possible in the upcoming trading sessions. In the past, when XRP reached $0.60, the price suffered a sharp drop shortly after that. The coin faces overhead resistance at $0.67. Moving above this level could help XRP retain its gains for longer. If there is a price pullback, the first line of support is $0.57. A drop below this level would take XRP down to $0.50. The technical outlook indicates excessive bullish strength, with demand and accumulation showing significant positivity. The Relative Strength Index is above 80, which suggests that the token is overbought and overvalued, increasing the likelihood of a price retracement. However, demand is expected to remain positive if the price stays above the 20-Simple Moving Average line (red), which coincides with the $0.58 price mark.

This article explores Multichain’s (MULTI) unique features while exploring a new token, Uwerx, and learning about its exploding presale. Multichain (MULTI): The Ultimate Web3 Router Multichain (MULTI) is predicted to become the main router for Web3 soon. Multichain (MULTI) was launched in 2020 on the 20th of July to provide solutions for various blockchains, especially regarding their communication needs. With Mulltichain (MULTI), every blockchain has its community, unique services, and development ecosystem. Multichain (MULTI) is selling at $4.33 and is predicted to reach $7.42 by 2024 if its community grows at the current pace. Uwerx (WERX): ​The Freelancers’ Community Uwerx is set to be launched on the 4th of August, 2023. Over the months, and during its presale, Uwerx has released several mouthwatering updates about the platform and its launching, leaving freelancers and crypto investors eagerly anticipating. Uwerx is an upcoming freelancing platform that will provide freelancers with a perfect virtual world to work in and provide crypto investors with a stable and profitable investment choice. For freelancers, the Uwerx team has emphasized that Uwerx is to become the freelancer’s first choice. With its 1% flat fee, unlike the ludicrous 10% and 20% fees offered by other freelancing platforms, Uwerx is ready to put its money where its mouth’s at. A blaring green light for crypto investors about Uwerx is its successful audit approval by both InterFi Network and SolidProof. This audit approval alone shows interested crypto investors that Uwerx is that token! Uwerx will be renouncing its contract ownership once it’s launched on the 4th of August, 2023, and this will be done to ensure the prevention of all cryptocurrency-related scams and frauds. Perhaps these positive updates about the upcoming platform are the secrets behind Uwerx’sgrowing numbers. Uwerx is making great steps to ensure that these figures have extra zeroes at their end before Q4 2024. Uwerx has already been listed on CoinSniper and will soon be listed on Uniswap by the 1st of August, 2023. Also, to ensure that the WERX tokens are protected, Uwerx will implement a 25-year liquidity lock before the end of its presale. Uwerx will also be launching a Test Airdrop for its users before the 31st of July, 2023, the scheduled date for the end of Uwerx’s hard cap presale. To further provide Uwerx users with extra security, the Uwerx Vault has now been unveiled. Storing your WERX tokens in the Uwerx Vault works just like staking, and you can store your tokens for different periods and earn rewards depending on Uwerx’s variables. The Uwerx team is working on releasing the Alpha platform in phases. The PDF Version of these pages has now been released: the Signing-Up Page, the Logging-In page, and the job creation process, amongst others. Soon, Uwerx will be transitioning from the Alpha platform to the Beta platform, so users can try out the platform for themselves while sharing their observations with the Uwerx team at feedback@uwerx.network.

Meme coin lovers are attracted by projects that could experience exponential growth, leading to high returns overnight. However, finding the right projects is not such an easy task, especially as more and more coins appear on the market each day. To help you out, we’ve done the research on your behalf and we discovered the best altcoins to buy with huge potential for growth in the next period. Here are the 5 crypto picks for 100x returns that currently generate hype and attention within the community: DigiToads (TOADS), Floki Inu (FLOKI), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Monacoin (MONA). DigiToads DigiToads is one of the few presales this year that have generated huge buzz in the media. However, TOADS is more than a simple meme coin. In fact, this coin departs from the purely speculative business model and puts forward a robust ecosystem with plenty of opportunities to generate returns both actively and passively. DigiToads combines a play-to-earn gaming universe with a stake-to-earn rare feature. These core elements attract gaming enthusiasts, who get to play with digital toads in an immersive world to earn TOADS in gaming competitions, but also long-term investors, who can buy TOADS and use them to purchase and stake trending NFTs in return for regular passive income. Perhaps another crucial aspect is the deflationary nature of the TOADS ERC20 coins. This leads to the scarcity effect, unlike other inflationary coins, which means that TOADS holders do not only stand to benefit from value appreciation but also enjoy the potential for long-term passive returns. FLOKI FLOKI started out as a joke coin, but the dev team decided to expand into key areas like decentralized finance, NFTs, and the Metaverse. Despite being relatively new, just like TOADS, FLOKI is expected by experts to deliver significant growth and success in the next year. The crypto project differentiates itself from other meme coins. Just like TOADS, it focuses on real-life use cases, which are expected to keep generating demand for the token. Shiba Inu Shiba Inu has been at the top of the list for quite some time now. Despite some bumps down the road this year, SHIB is still expected to live up to its reputation. The purpose of SHIB is to become one of the main decentralized cryptocurrencies that focus on a fun community of users. Dogecoin Dogecoin’s cultural appeal has remained unaltered thanks to its lighthearted origin. Just like SHIB, a key driver for growth for this meme coin is the internet meme that has created a strong community. Also, DOGE has enjoyed multiple celebrity endorsements, with figures prominent in business, entertainment, and crypto industries offering attention to this meme coin. Monacoin Monacoin first appeared in Japan and garnered attention after appearing on a Japanese TV network, where land was purchased using MONA. Monacoin is essentially a payment network that facilitates P2P transactions. One of the earliest meme coins, Monacoin enjoys a huge appeal, particularly in the Japanese crypto community. In addition to this, while some meme coins lack utility, MONA is used for multiple purposes, including tipping, donations, or as a means of exchange. Summary The rise of meme coins has taken many by surprise. Among the top contenders, DigiToadsstands out for its unique approach that combines play-to-earn gaming and a stake-to-earn mechanism with multiple community contests and awards. As the meme coin landscape evolves, investors and traders are becoming more discerning than ever. The meme coin market offers huge potential for excitement, adrenaline, and gains, but it’s important to focus on projects like DigiToads with robust growth potential and a solid foundation.

42419906,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGZsT,1689270732,Setting Boundaries: Defining Active and Passive Management for Crypto,"This week Max Freccia from Truvius shares his perspectives on active vs. passive management and how these different investment models – well-defined in TradFi – can be applied to cryptocurrency investing. Many crypto investing tools have been launched, including SMA platforms, portfolio tools and ETFs. Max covers simple buy-and-hold strategies, automated indices and discretionary management and the pros and cons of each of those.  It’s fascinating to see the maturity of this asset class happening before our eyes and the different models emerging to support client interest and help advisors navigate their path into digital asset investing. As tools emerge for advisors, they can determine how to include this asset class alongside their traditional investment business. Since the British Standard Chartered Bank has forecast a 2024 BTC price of $120,000, up from $100,000 in April, advisors can expect clients to initiate conversations.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  For perspective, consider that in a 2019 study, Yale Economist Aleh Tsyvinski proposed that investors should consider holding 6% bitcoin in their portfolios, recommending “that even the staunchest opponents of the cryptocurrency world are best off investing 1% of their assets in this space, if only for diversification purposes.”  Four years later (eons ago in the crypto space), a Google search today asking, “How much should I invest in crypto,” will highlight various sources supporting an investment between 1% and 6%, with other recommendations as high as 12%.  As advisors, you need to support clients interested in crypto investment, but which investment strategy will you take? Will you consider an active or passive investment model when advising your clients?  Down below we have links to other resources in the keep reading section for those interested in continued reading on today’s topic.  If you have questions for our Advisor network or have topics you’d like to see covered, get in touch, and we will try to answer them in future editions of Crypto for Advisors.  – S.M.  Setting Boundaries: Defining Active and Passive Management for Crypto  Advisors should be provided with clearer definitions of active and passive management for digital assets to make more informed portfolio choices for their clients  – Max Freccia  Since the creation of index funds, allocating between active and passive management remains the subject of great debate among investors. Over time, the boundary lines between active and passive investment vehicles for traditional asset classes have become better defined, benefiting from decades of analysis and product development. Unfortunately, the same cannot yet be said for crypto investment products.  Advisors investing in established asset classes today are tasked less with disentangling “active” vs. “passive” and more with determining how much active risk to take on for clients, and choosing the most sensible ways to do so from an accessible, well-populated landscape of highly competitive investment vehicles.  The task is doubly challenging for advisors interested in digital assets because “active” and “passive” investment options are still only nascently defined and starkly lacking in sophistication and ease of access.  What does “active management” look like for crypto today? The following framework lays out the crypto investment landscape currently available for advisors, divided into three categories with pros and cons for each as well as their active or passive nature.  1. Single Token Buy-and-Hold  Often implemented directly via exchanges through separately managed account platforms (SMAs) or investment trusts (especially in the absence of SEC-approved spot ETFs), buy-and-hold is the most simplistic way to add digital assets to an overall portfolio.  Pros:  Direct access to crypto  Low portfolio management overhead  Potentially more accessible via advisors’ existing wealth technology platforms  Cons:  Lack of diversification  Clients can independently obtain exposure  Potentially outsized management fees for naïve exposure  Certain vehicles may introduce unintended risks  Active vs. Passive: This represents passive exposure to a subset of digital assets (commonly BTC and ETH) but without the diversification and risk-management benefits of typical rules-based passive indices.  2. Automated Indices  Automated indices provide a rules-based framework for crypto exposure to a broader number of assets (often the top 10-25 assets by market cap) and systematically rebalance to meet portfolio construction goals. Currently, U.S. investors often access these products through multi-asset SMAs.  Pros:  Improved diversification and outperformance potential vs. single-token exposures  Rules-based portfolio construction creates consistent exposure to the broader crypto market  Cons:  Current options often lack nuanced thematic or sector-specific allocations or personalized customization  Typically higher-touch onboarding process vs. individual buy-and-hold  Potential underperformance vs. actively managed products  Active vs. Passive: While some tout the automated nature (i.e., rebalancing) of these products as “active,” these should be considered purely passive exposures akin to index funds for traditional asset classes.  3. Quantitative or Discretionary Management  Active managers construct strategies that leverage discretionary blockchain expertise and quantitative on-chain analysis to provide sophisticated crypto exposures. These are often accessed via hedge funds or specialized SMAs.  Pros:  Institutional-grade expertise for a rapidly developing and technical asset class  Potential for risk-adjusted outperformance and/or reduced correlation to the market  Often superior risk management and trade execution  Cons:  Accessibility hurdles often exist, including limited capacity or high investment minimums  Manager selection may be challenging due to shorter track records  May exhibit periods of underperformance vs. passive products  Active vs. Passive: This represents true active management commensurate with standards for traditional asset classes.  Bringing Crypto Investment Products into Focus  The developing nature of the digital asset investment product landscape leaves the delineation between active and passive investment products, and how to access them, fuzzy at best. Ultimately, more clearly defining the available active and passive options and how they relate to traditional investment evaluation frameworks will equip advisors to more confidently select the most appropriate digital asset solutions for their clients.  Ask an Advisor  With the rise in interest in crypto following the BlackRock ETF application, we have been getting more questions regarding portfolio allocation.  – Adam Blumberg  Q: How do I view crypto in a portfolio?  A: We usually consider crypto an Alternative Asset based on the risk characteristics. However, most Alts are illiquid and only available for accredited investors with high minimums. Crypto is incredibly liquid and available to any investor with virtually no minimum investment.  The risk is the critical part here, however. Advisors must ensure the client can stand to lose all their crypto investments.  Q: Should I plan to rebalance?  A: That depends on the investment thesis, risk profile of the client, etc.  If you’re investing in bitcoin for the long term, as a multi-year inflation hedge, then you will probably keep it for several years. If you’re choosing an allocation to crypto as part of an overall risk management and diversification strategy, then you probably rebalance quarterly (an approach that has outperformed the S&P).  Q: Should my clients hold crypto or a fund?  A: To make this decision, first consult your compliance department and what they will allow. Of course, a bitcoin spot ETF may be on the way this year, but there are already several ETFs and other investments that give exposure to crypto and are already approved. Those funds are much easier to put into retirement accounts as well.  Holding actual crypto is holding a bearer instrument. It takes more technical know-how and carries some technical risk.  Again, it depends on the investment thesis. If you want to get your clients exposure to the upside without having to learn wallets and other custodial technology, funds are the way to go. If you and your clients subscribe to more long-term and revolutionary theses, holding crypto in wallets would work.  Keep Reading  U.S. crypto exchanges transact less than 10% of the world’s crypto trades. As adoption grows in the U.S. market, that market share will likely have to grow to support onshore trade and settlement.  Institutions and investors surveyed by PWC in Asia state self-custody as challenging and inflexible when trading crypto. These same issues will impact advisors actively managing clients’ crypto investments as adoption grows.  How will crypto investments work with 401Ks? Advisors are starting to include crypto holdings as part of retirement savings accounts.

With the proposal gaining traction, will the price continue to rise, and is it too late to buy MATIC? New Proposal To Change MATIC To POL In an interesting turn of events, Polygon founders have suggested an overhaul of the Layer-2 blockchain’s native MATIC token in favor of a new token. The proposal involves upgrading the current token in an effort to change and improve its capabilities, which transcends just its native chain to other chains. Related Reading: Litecoin Becomes 10th-Largest Cryptocurrency, But Is There Still Room To Run? A new token name (POL) was proposed in lieu of MATIC, which much better reflects the Polygon name. The upgrade is centered on this POL token which would allow for better scalability as well as help to bring more rewards for Polygon’s validators. The token would be operable across all Polygon networks, such as Polygon’s main blockchain and Polygon’s zkEVM, in addition to other supernets that run on Polygon. Polygon says it plans to create three new layers of rewards for its validators, including transaction fees, protocol rewards, as well as other rewards to be made available to validate across multiple chains. Basically, the POL token will be to incentivize the validators who help to secure the network. MATIC price up 5% in one day | Source: MATICUSD on Tradingview.com The proposal by the founders is yet to pass as the Polygon community will still need to vote on it. However, if it does pass, the founders have proposed that all MATIC holders will be provided up to four years to exchange their tokens for POL. Polygon Token Price Soars Following the announcement of this proposal, the price of Polygon’s MATIC token has responded positively. The token which had been trading sideways for most of this week quickly saw a reversal and recorded over 5% in daily gains. MATIC’s gains so far have seen it emerge as the second-highest gainer on Coinmarketmap, following behind SingularityNET’s AGIX. The price has now moved from trending below $0.73 to sitting firmly above $0.76 at the time of this writing. MATIC is second-highest gainer on Coinmarketcap | Source: Coinmarketcap However, despite the price increase, the price of MATIC still sits considerably lower than it did five months ago. Given that its price is sitting almost 50% lower than its February high of $1.5, this could present an opportunity to take advantage of MATIC’s low price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sharks And Whales Go On $2.15 Billion Buying Spree, Is It Time To Sell? If the proposal passes, then it could be bullish for the digital asset, as already demonstrated over the past day.

42419919,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGa2n,1689267466,"Crypto Markets ‘Highly Dependent’ on Stablecoins Lacking Transparency, TUSD Poses Risk: Kaiko","Centralized stablecoins dominate cryptocurrency trading, but recent turbulence has showcased that markets heavily rely on stablecoins that lack transparency of their reserves with TrueUSD posing the biggest risk, digital asset market research firm Kaiko said in a report.  As of Thursday, 74% of all transactions on centralized crypto exchanges involved stablecoins, while only 23% incorporated fiat currencies, Kaiko data shows.  Trading volume of TrueUSD (TUSD), which has lately fallen under scrutiny due to the implosion of banking partner Prime Trust and disruptions in its reserve reporting, has grown dramatically to 19% from less than 1% in three months. Tether’s USDT, which was partially backed by Chinese commercial papers in the past, claimed a 70% share of volumes.  Stablecoins – cryptocurrencies that peg their price to another asset, predominantly to the U.S. dollar – have become a key piece of plumbing for the crypto ecosystem, facilitating trading and onboarding from government-issued fiat currencies. The asset class has a combined market capitalization of $128 billion, per CCData.  The largest stablecoins have all endured periods of turmoil in the last few months. In February, New York state regulators ordered Paxos to halt minting Binance USD (BUSD), the third largest stablecoin at the time. Next month, the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) temporarily froze a sizable portion of USDC’s cash reserves, which affected Maker’s DAI stablecoin. Last month, USDT endured sell pressure in a key stablecoin liquidity pool, spooking traders, and TUSD weathered the implosion of its custodial partner.  These volatile periods highlighted how crypto markets are exposed to risks and vulnerabilities of stablecoins, Clara Medalie, head of research at Kaiko, noted.  “Crypto markets are highly dependent on centralized stablecoins that often lack transparency around reserves,” she said.  “While Circle has made huge efforts to improve USDC transparency (and even Tether has made some efforts over the past year), the relatively unknown TUSD is today posing the biggest risk, offering the least information about its reserves or corporate structure.”  The $3 billion TUSD is a dollar-pegged stablecoin that was acquired by a little-known Asian conglomerate Techteryx in late 2020, taking over its intellectual property. The firm denied reports about being connected to Tron founder Justin Sun, sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for market manipulation.  TUSD is backed by fiat assets, according to Chainlink’s proof-of-reserves technology, which relies on data received from The Network Firm's reserve attestations. The Network Firm is a rebranded version of the accounting team working with FTX.US, the collapsed crypto exchange’s U.S. entity.  The token’s rapid rise followed Binance’s decision to promote the stablecoin with zero-fee trading on its platform after the clampdown on BUSD earlier this year.

Armstrong had become aware of stories circulating on Twitter about suspicious account closures at the banking giant, which some users believed were tied to their cryptocurrency activity.  While 19.3% answered Armstrong’s query “no,” a whopping 9%, which would translate into roughly 1,200 people given there were 13,746 respondents to the question as of press time, said “yes.” The rest didn’t participate in the poll but were solely interested in seeing the results.  Armstrong’s tweet comes after bitcoin layer-2 platform Stacks co-creator Muneeb Ali tweeted on Wednesday that his personal Bank of America bank account was closed without any reason given. Ali claims, however, that it was due to the transactions on Coinbase he made through the account to buy and sell bitcoin.  “This is war on bitcoin and crypto,” Ali tweeted. “We won’t stay silent.”  In an interview with CoinDesk, Ali said he deliberately positioned his Bank of America account as his only one where he carried out Coinbase transactions. ""I knew that is where closure risk is,"" Ali said, noting he ""kept other bank accounts 'clean.'""  Several people with similar cases of sudden account closures at Bank of America have used Twitter to share their frustration in recent weeks, though the closures were not necessarily tied to their crypto activity.

42419910,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGZwb,1689264288,"Ripple, Crypto Industry Score Partial Win in SEC Court Fight Over XRP","Ripple scored a partial victory in its fight with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in a court ruling that brought a modicum of regulatory clarity for the cryptocurrency industry.  The sale of Ripple’s XRP tokens on exchanges and through algorithms did not constitute investment contracts, the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of New York ruled Thursday. But the institutional sale of the tokens did violate federal securities laws, the court said.  XRP rallied on the news, and crypto exchange Gemini said it might now list the token, but early reads from legal experts suggest the ruling falls short of settling the question of whether and under what circumstances a digital asset meets the definition of a security under U.S. law.  Under Chairman Gary Gensler, the SEC has contended most of them do, and thus that they require issuers to go through a lengthy and expensive registration process before selling them to the public, and exchanges to register as broker-dealers before listing them. The industry has maintained that it is ambiguous how laws written during the analog era apply to an asset class born on the internet.  The court published the conclusions in an order partially granting a motion for summary judgment in the seminal U.S. SEC case against the blockchain platform. The regulator in 2020 filed suit against the firm and its executives CEO Brad Garlinghouse and co-founder Christian Larsen alleging failure to register XRP as security before offering around $1.3 billion worth of tokens.  The ruling  According to the order from the U.S. Court for the Southern District of New York, Ripple first sold around $728.9 million worth of XRP directly to institutional buyers, hedge funds and other parties. These ""institutional sales"" constituted the unregistered offer and sale of investment contracts in violation of federal securities law, the order said, as it found investors would have purchased XRP with the expectation that they would profit from Ripple's work.  Ripple used the funds it received from institutional sales to ""promote and increase the value of XRP by developing uses for XRP and protecting the XRP trading market,"" the order said.  The SEC’s motion for summary judgment was granted by the court as it applies to the institutional sale, and otherwise denied.  The ""programmatic sales"" of XRP through exchanges and algorithms did not qualify as the sale of securities because the SEC cannot definitively say speculative investors had “a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.”  ""There is no evidence that a reasonable Programmatic Buyer, who was generally less sophisticated as an investor, shared similar “understandings and expectations” and could parse through the multiple documents and statements that the SEC highlights, which include statements (sometimes inconsistent) across many social media platforms and news sites from a variety of Ripple speakers (with different levels of authority) over an extended eight-year period,"" the order said.  Larsen and Garlinghouse's own sale of XRP falls into this category, the order said, along with other distributions. Ripple's motion for summary judgment in lieu of ""programmatic sales,"" other distributions, and Larsen’s and Garlinghouse’s sales, was granted.  Another motion by the SEC for summary judgment on an ""aiding and abetting claim"" against the two executives was denied as the court deemed it ""is not clear whether Larsen and Garlinghouse knew or recklessly disregarded that securities laws, rather than laws under other regulatory regimes, applied to XRP.""  ""We said in Dec. 2020 that we were on the right side of the law, and will be on the right side of history. Thankful to everyone who helped us get to today’s decision – one that is for all crypto innovation in the U.S. More to come,"" Garlinghouse tweeted following the order.  UPDATE (July 13, 16:44 UTC): Adds details from the order throughout article.  UPDATE (July 13, 15:17 UTC): Clarifies what the order refers to as ""other distributions.""

Alex Mashinsky, co-founder and former CEO of the insolvent cryptocurrency lender Celsius Network was arrested on Thursday according to a US Department of Justice (DOJ) indictment. Mashinsky and others have been charged with seven counts, including securities, commodities, and wire fraud, and a conspiracy charge to manipulate $CEL, Celsius’ native token, Bloomberg reports. SEC, CFTC, and FTC File Lawsuits Against Mashinsky The DOJ’s indictment is accompanied by separate lawsuits by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) against the company and Mashinsky. Celsius filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July 2022, and the Fahrenheit consortium recently won a bid to acquire the lender’s assets. DOJ: Mashinsky Misled Investors for Years The Department of Justice accused Mashinsky and Celsius’ Chief Revenue Officer Roni Cohen-Pavon of running “a years-long scheme to mislead customers” on Celsius’ market value and its interest in CEL. Bloomberg reports the DOJ indictment further accused Mashinsky of making false and misleading public statements regarding his own sales of CEL. The DOJ indictment reads: Mashinsky portrayed Celsius as a modern-day bank, where customers could safely deposit crypto assets and earn interest. In truth, however, Mashinsky operated Celsius as a risky investment fund, taking in customer money under false and misleading pretences. CFTC Alleges a Fraud Scheme The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) accused Mashinsky and Celsius of participating in a “scheme to defraud hundreds of thousands of customers by misrepresenting the safety and profitability of its digital asset-based finance platform.” The complaint adds despite worsening market conditions, Celsius continued to “promote the safety and viability of Celsius, and failed to disclose these losses to customers.” The regulator further alleges Celsius violated several federal commodities regulations, failed to register as a Commodity Pool Operator, engaged in fraud, and did not provide sufficient disclosure documents. Investigators from the CFTC previously concluded that Mashinsky and Celsius violated several US laws. SEC Accuses Celsius and Mashinsky of Securities Fraud In a separate lawsuit, the Securities and Exchange Commission accused Mashinsky and the firm of securities fraud. According to the SEC, CEL and Celsius’ Earn product are securities. The SEC’s complaint alleges: In this case, Celsius offered and sold CEL and the Earn Interest Program as securities. Celsius and Mashinsky never filed a registration statement or had one in effect with the SEC for their offers and sales of securities through the Earn Interest Program. FTC Announces $4.7 Billion Settlement With Celsius The barrage of claims against Celsius and its former CEO further included a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) complaint. The FTC said Celsius violated the Federal Trade Commission Act “in connection with the marketing and sale of cryptocurrency lending and custody services.” The commission said: Defendants assured customers that Celsius maintained sufficient reserves to meet customer obligations. However, the FTC reached a settlement agreement with Celsius “that will permanently ban it from handling customers’ assets” and prohibits it from “offering, marketing, or promoting any product or services that could be used to deposit, exchange, invest or withdraw any assets.” Celsius has agreed to a $4.7 billion judgement which will only be paid after creditors and investors have been repaid in bankruptcy proceedings. Samuel Levine, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Customer Protection, commented on Celsius's alleged conduct, saying: Celsius touted a new business model but engaged in an old-fashioned swindle.

14847751,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542570,1689260442,Circle To Lay Off Staff And Refocus On Core Activities,"Circle, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, has recently laid off a portion of its workforce amid a turbulent year for the digital asset industry. According to the company, the recent layoffs aimed to maintain a strong balance sheet. And by streamlining its workforce and reducing costs, the company may be better positioned to weather the challenging market conditions. Circle has characterized the recent layoffs as a marginal reduction in headcount, which is part of a broader effort to reduce operational expenses and discontinue investments in non-core activities. According to the Reuters report, a Circle spokesperson said that: Circle is redoubling its focus on core business activities and execution. It has identified new areas for investment and is continuing to hire in key areas of focus on a global basis. Circle Had Expressed Plans To Expand The Workforce Earlier The recent news of Circle’s workforce reduction comes as a surprise, given that the company’s finance chief, Jeremy Fox-Green, had announced earlier this year that the USD Coin issuer had other plans. Fox-Geen mentioned that Circle had plans to increase this headcount by 15% to 25% by the end of the year, which would have added to its 900-employee workforce. Despite the recent workforce reduction, Circle has indicated that it is still actively recruiting for “key areas of focus.” Related Reading: Celsius Takes Legal Action Against StakeHound For Withholding $150 Million Fox-Green said that the company is “growing and investing and we are fortunate to be in a financial position to be able to sustain our investments.” Circle’s decision to expand its workforce by up to 25% this year represented a slower growth rate compared to 2022 when the company had doubled its headcount from the previous year. In other news, Circle had recently announced its new chief legal officer, Heath Tarbert, who previously served as the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission(CFTC). According to Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire, the company aims to bridge the gap between traditional finance and Web3, and Tarbert’s experience and legal expertise will be instrumental in advancing the utility value of the USDC stablecoin worldwide. On the developmental front, Circle made significant progress last week when CEO Jeremy Allaire announced that the company had launched its programmable wallets into production beta, marking a major milestone in the rollout of Circle’s Web3 services. The programmable wallets are designed to enable developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum blockchain. In the past few months, a number of high-profile companies in the cryptocurrency industry have announced workforce reductions. Among them are well-known firms such as Blockchain.com, Coinbase, Genesis, Huobi, and SuperRare, to name a few. Around one month ago, Binance carried out employee layoffs as part of its efforts to assess whether it has the appropriate talent to navigate the cryptocurrency market. Related Reading: Chainlink Price Stalls At Key Support Level, Have The Bears Taken Over? The cryptocurrency industry appears to be in a prolonged period of adjustment.

Celsius, founded in 2018, was promoted by Mashinsky as an alternative to traditional lenders that could enable people to earn double-digit returns by lending out their crypto. But, in the wake of broader market downturn, the company was forced to halt withdrawals in June 2022, and then it filed for bankruptcy protection shortly thereafter. A portion of its customers' assets are still locked up in bankruptcy, but the company recently got approved to sell its altcoin holdings or convert them to bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) or ethereum ( ETH-USD ) this month. “Celsius touted a new business model but engaged in an old-fashioned swindle,” Samuel Levine, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement . The concurrent SEC proceedings alleged that Mashinsky and Celsius duped investors into buying CEL ( CEL-USD ) and depositing money into the company's Earn Interest program that promised exceptionally high returns on customers' crypto deposits. The Wall Street regulator also accused the defendants of misrepresenting ""Celsius's central business model and the risks to investors by claiming that Celsius did not make uncollateralized loans, the company did not engage in risky trading, and the interest paid to investors represented 80% of the company's revenue,"" adding that ""none of these claims was true."" Shortly before its demise, Celsius suffered significant losses, as its risky investment strategies (e.g. extending millions of dollars in uncollateralized and in unregulated decentralized finance agreements) fared poorly in the wake of a crypto bear market. Even so, the CFTC alleged , Mashinsky ""continued to promote the safety and viability of Celsius, and failed to disclose these losses to customers. Even worse, despite its worsening financial position, Defendants continued to solicit new customers with the same misrepresentations that digital asset commodities deposited with Celsius were safe and would earn customers high yield returns."" In January, Mashinsky was sued by New York state's attorney general for defrauding hundreds of thousands of investors out of billions of dollars worth of digital coins.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/news/3987423-ex-celsius-ceo-alex-mashinsky-arrested-sued-by-three-regulators?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/14846987.jpeg

14846120,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/polygon-matic-to-become-pol,1689256843,Polygon $MATIC to become $POL,"Polygon, the prominent Ethereum layer 2 scaling solution, is making strides towards a significant upgrade, changing its token from $MATIC to $POL. $POL token to have increased functionality The team behind Polygon has put forward a proposal that could change the game for its native token, $MATIC. This isn't just a minor tweak; it's part of the grand plan for Polygon 2.0., and if the community gives the green light, $MATIC tokens will transform into Polygon ($POL) tokens. But these aren't just any tokens. $POL tokens will have the power to be staked across multiple chains within the Polygon ecosystem. This isn't just about changing the name; it's about boosting the scalability of the ecosystem without putting security on the line. The new $POL token won't be confined to a single protocol. It's designed to be a jack-of-all-trades, operating across all Polygon protocols. That includes Proof of Stake (PoS), zkEVM, and Supernets. What does this mean for Polygon validators? They'll have the ability to secure transactions across different chains, making the ecosystem even more robust. If $MATIC token holders are wondering what this means for them. Well, the transition from $MATIC to $POL is designed to be one easy and smooth transaction. A holder would just need to send their $MATIC tokens to a specific smart contract in order to receive an equivalent number of $POL tokens. An upgrade to enhance Polygon ecosystem In addition, in order for everyone to get adjusted to the new $POL token, the Polygon team is thinking of allocating a period of at least four years for token holders to complete the upgrade process, which is probably plenty of time to get used to the new token and its functionalities. The proposed upgrade is still to be signed off by the Polygon community, and if they give the thumbs up, the migration to $POL could happen in the near future. Polygon’s proposed upgrade is an exciting development for the entire ecosystem. Should the upgrade be approved it has the potential to push Polygon further to the forefront of the Ethereum layer 2 race. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

14846123,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542520,1689256825,Bitcoin MVRV At Critical Level: Will A Break Happen?,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin “Market Value to Realized Value” (MVRV) is at a critical level currently. Will a bullish breakout take place? Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Is Retesting The 1.5 Level Right Now As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC MVRV ratio has been around a critical level recently. The “MVRV ratio” is an indicator that measures the ratio between the market cap of Bitcoin and its realized cap. The “realized cap” here refers to a capitalization model for the asset that assumes that the true value of each coin in the circulating supply is not the current spot price, but the price at which the coin was last transferred on the blockchain. This model aims to find a sort of “real value” for the coin, so its comparison with the market cap in the MVRV ratio can tell us how the current spot price (that is, the market cap) weighs up against this fair value. When the indicator has a value greater than one, it means that the market cap is more than the realized cap right now. In this situation, the investors are holding more value than they put in, so they become more likely to sell and harvest these profits. Thus, this kind of trend can suggest the asset is becoming overpriced and a correction may be on the horizon. On the other hand, low values imply the market cap of the cryptocurrency may be undervalued at the moment as the average investor is holding their coins at a loss. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin MVRV ratio over the last few years: Looks like the value of the metric has gone up recently | Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin MVRV ratio had been below the one mark back during most of the second half of 2022. This isn’t an unusual trend, as bearish periods normally see investors going into deep losses, which naturally results in the indicator’s value plunging. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stuck In Tight Range: Will BTC Decompress With A Big Move? What’s interesting, though, is the metric’s interaction with the line where its value becomes 1. While bearish trends last, the level usually provides resistance to the asset. Examples of this happening during the past year’s bear market can be seen in the chart. With the rally this year, however, Bitcoin was able to break past this level, implying that a transition toward a bullish regime had occurred. The indicator briefly dropped to this level in March, but the line provided support to it, confirming that a bullish trend was indeed active. The MVRV ratio has now recently surged towards the 1.5 level, at which the market cap is 50% more than the realized cap. At these values, the asset naturally starts becoming overpriced and the risk of corrections goes up. From the graph, it’s visible that the coin found resistance at this 1.5 level when it was retested back in April. Since surging back toward it recently, the cryptocurrency has been moving sideways around this level so far. Related Reading: Polygon Volume Registers Sharp Increase, What Does It Mean? It now remains to be seen whether the Bitcoin MVRV ratio can break through this level with the current retest, or if it will end up facing another rejection. Naturally, if it’s the former, the rally might be able to continue. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $30,500, down 2% in the last week.

The percentage of funds with crypto exposure fell to 29% from 37% in 2022, according to the Global Crypto Hedge Fund Report. No traditional hedge funds plan to decrease their exposure this year, it said.  More than a third (37%) of funds without crypto exposure said they are curious, but are waiting for the asset class to mature further. That's up from the 30% reported a year ago. More than half, 54%, said they are unlikely to invest in the next three years, compared with 41% in the previous report.  Overall, the report speaks to a mixed sentiment toward crypto from traditional financial institutions, with ""regulatory uncertainty"" the watch words, as is often the case. PwC found that almost a quarter of hedge funds are reassessing their strategies due to the regulatory environment in the U.S., with 12% considering relocating from the U.S. to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions.  “Despite market volatility, a fall in digital asset prices and the collapse of a number of crypto businesses, investment in crypto-assets is expected to remain strong in 2023,"" Jon Garvey, PwC United States' global financial services leader, said.

With funding from the foundation that oversees development of Metis, a layer-2 Ethereum protocol, ZKM is developing a hybrid approach that combines Optmistic and Zero-Knowledge rollups into one, according to an emailed announcement on Thursday. Rollups are a way of bundling transactions to improve throughput and lower transaction costs.  The system plans to start operating on the Ethereum testnet in January next year.  Metis will be the first network to use ZKM's hybrid rollup, which will allow the layer 1 chain to implement instant transfers from the layer 2.  ""From a user experience perspective, all the users in the Metis ecosystem will benefit from instant, no-limit asset transfers,"" ZKM told CoinDesk in a statement.  ZKM said it aims to improve existing layer-2 networks, such as Metis and Optimism, with the goal of making its rollup compatible with other layer 1s, like Solana, Avalanche and BNB Chain.  After that, ZKM said, it plans to make Ethereum a settlement layer for non-blockchain applications, offering its infrastructure to systems in cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT).

14844766,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/uniswap-launches-on-avalanche,1689253800,Uniswap Launches On Avalanche,"Uniswap users can now start swapping their Avalanche tokens on the Uniswap website, as the decentralized exchange has now launched on the Avalanche network. Uniswap’s C-Chain Debut Leading decentralized exchange (DEX) and automated market maker (AMM), Uniswap, has made its debut on Avalanche C-Chain, marking another significant expansion of the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector on the Avalanche blockchain. Uniswap's move follows in the footsteps of other prominent DeFi platforms like Curve and Aave, who have already established a presence on Avalanche. This expansion was made possible through a governance proposal initiated by the University of Michigan's blockchain club, Michigan Blockchain. The proposal, aiming to promote a diverse and robust multi-chain future, received overwhelming support during the on-chain vote, with an impressive 95% majority in favor of the deployment. Ava Labs Head Welcomes Uniswap The integration of LayerZero, an interoperability protocol facilitating Avalanche's BTC.b, played a crucial role in enabling the deployment. LayerZero acts as a communication bridge between Ethereum and Avalanche, allowing for seamless cross-chain asset transfers and governance proposals. Expressing excitement about the integration, Luigi D'Onorio DeMeo, the Head of DeFi and Developer Relations at Ava Labs, said, “We’re thrilled to welcome battle-tested DeFi mainstay Uniswap to C-Chain, strengthening the competition between DEXes on Avalanche. The opportunity set for DEXes on Avalanche is huge. As new Subnets launch, more liquidity for DEXes like Uniswap will likely come to C-Chain. Furthermore, Avalanche Warp Messaging creates other unique opportunities for DEXes that aren’t possible on other EVM chains.” Leading DEX For Traders And Liquidity Providers Uniswap, originally launched on Ethereum in 2018, revolutionized the market with its innovative AMM model. By facilitating trades through liquidity pools, the platform offered traders and liquidity providers an efficient and indirect trading method. With over 139 million trades conducted and a trading volume exceeding $1.5 trillion, Uniswap remains a dominant force in the AMM space. The current iteration, known as V3, introduces concentrated liquidity, allowing liquidity providers to allocate their assets within specific price ranges. This feature empowers liquidity providers to customize their strategies for each pool, potentially generating higher fees. Uniswap's integration into Avalanche's ecosystem, alongside other pioneering Avalanche-native exchanges like Trader Joe, Dexalot, and DeltaPrime, further enriches the DEX options available to users. Uniswap V4 Uniswap's recent expansion onto the Avalanche blockchain aligns with its upcoming upgrade to version 4 (V4), a highly anticipated development that hinges on the Ethereum Cancun upgrade, which is expected to be deployed in September. According to a developer from Uniswap Labs, the V4 upgrade will grant users the ability to construct their own features, paving the way for endless possibilities. Among the notable advancements in V4 is the introduction of a novel smart contract variant known as ""hooks."" This feature empowers developers to create innovative solutions on top of Uniswap's liquidity pools, further expanding the platform's capabilities.

42419905,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGZtV,1689253200,More Tokenized Treasuries Arrive on Polygon as Digital Bond Market Expands,"Ondo Finance, which already offers tokenized U.S. Treasuries on the Ethereum blockchain, expanded the product to the Polygon network.  The company has issued its OUSG token, a tokenized version of BlackRock’s short-term U.S. government bond exchange-traded fund (ETF), natively on Polygon as part of a “strategic alliance,” according to a press release Thursday.  The firm also plans to bring its upcoming yield-generating stablecoin alternative, which is a tokenized money market fund called OMMF, as well as the Ondo-developed decentralized lending marketplace Flux Finance – pending governance approval – to Polygon, Ondo President and Chief Operating Officer Justin Schmidt said in an interview.  The development comes as demand for tokenized versions of traditional financial instruments such as U.S. Treasuries is growing among investors, as bond yields have surpassed rates in decentralized finance (DeFi) lending markets. Wealth management firm Bernstein forecast that tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) could grow to $5 trillion in market value in the next five years.  Tokenized Treasuries has grown to a $600 million market, with Ondo Finance’s OUSG token claiming a significant share of $140 million since its inception in January. Flux Finance, developed by Ondo’s team and governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) through community votes, lets investors take out loans by pledging OUSG as collateral. It has $44 million of total value locked on the platform, according to DefiLlama.  Ondo’s move follows asset management giant Franklin Templeton, which made its tokenized Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX) available on Polygon after releasing it on Stellar in 2021.  Polygon is a layer-2 scaling network of Ethereum that allows users to transact more cheaply and faster than on the mainnet, which is prone to clogging during times of high blockchain activity, while still relying on Ethereum’s security.  “Ondo Finance building on Polygon is a crucial step toward bridging the gap between DeFi and institutional-grade finance,” said Colin Butler, global head of institutional capital at Polygon Labs.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | MATIC | ONDO,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/13/real-world-asset-platform-ondo-finance-expands-tokenized-treasurys-to-polygon,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e4fa4703d0a5fd8bc21a6b74f6f1f8dd70f40fe1-1500x1164.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Mashinsky and others are charged with seven counts including securities fraud, commodities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy to manipulate the price of Celsius' token CEL, according to a DOJ indictment.  The indictment was accompanied by a slew of separate lawsuits against Mashinsky and Celsius by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC).  The lending platform filed for bankruptcy in July 2022, and crypto consortium Fahrenheit recently won a bid to acquire its assets. In January, New York Attorney General Letitia James sued Mashinsky for allegedly misleading investors about the firm’s health leading up to its bankruptcy filing. Mashinsky later called the accusations ""baseless"" and said they were informed by online misinformation.  Flashback: What Crypto Lender Celsius Isn't Telling Depositors (2020)  Mashinsky charges  The DOJ accused Mashinsky and Celsius Chief Revenue Officer Roni Cohen-Pavon of orchestrating ""a years long scheme to mislead customers"" on the market value of the company's value and interest in CEL. The indictment added Mashinsky made false and misleading public statements about his own sales of CEL. Cohen-Pavon was also arrested on Thursday, according to a Bloomberg report.  ""Mashinsky portrayed Celsius as a modern-day bank, where customers could safely deposit crypto assets and earn interest. In truth, however, Mashinsky operated Celsius as a risky investment fund, taking in customer money under false and misleading pretenses,"" the indictment said, adding that Mashinsky misled investors about loans being collateralized, counterparties defaulting and regulatory scrutiny.  In a statement, the DOJ said it had struck a non-prosecution deal with Celsius itself, as the company had accepted responsibility for its role in the allegedly fraudulent scheme, and was cooperating.  The SEC, meanwhile, accused the firm and Mashinsky of securities fraud, in a lawsuit filed on the same day. In its complaint, the SEC asserted that CEL and Celsius' Earn product constituted securities.  “In this case, Celsius offered and sold CEL and the Earn Interest Program as securities…. Celsius and Mashinsky never filed a registration statement or had one in effect with the SEC for their offers and sales of securities through the Earn Interest Program,” the complaint said.  Speaking at a Thursday press conference, the SEC's Enforcement Director Gurbir Grewal said that defendants had misled investors, alleging they were ""often completely fabricating their financials.""  ""Today, along with our federal partners, we're holding Mashinsky and Celsius responsible for their lies and for their deceit,"" Grewal said.  In a separate complaint, the CFTC accused the company and Mashinsky of engaging in a ""scheme to defraud hundreds of thousands of customers by mispresenting the safety and profitability of its digital asset-based finance platform."" Despite deteriorating market conditions, the company continued to ""promote the safety and viability of Celsius, and failed to disclose these losses to customers,"" the CFTC filing added.  Read more: Sky-High Yields and Bright Red Flags: How Alex Mashinsky Went From Bashing Banks to Bankrupting Celsius  The CFTC alleges the firm violated federal commodities regulations, committed fraud and failed to register as a Commodity Pool Operator and provide relevant disclosure documents.  ""Defendants assured customers that Celsius maintained sufficient reserves to meet customer obligations,"" said a complaint by the FTC, which accused the firm of violating the Federal Trade Commission Act ""in connection with the marketing and sale of cryptocurrency lending and custody services.""  The FTC announced it had reached a settlement with Celsius Network ""that will permanently ban it from handling consumers’ assets,"" and block it from ""offering, marketing, or promoting any product or service that could be used to deposit, exchange, invest, or withdraw any assets.""  The FTC also charged former executives Shlomi Daniel Leon, Hanoch “Nuke” Goldstein and Mashinsky with tricking consumers into transferring crypto onto the platform. The regulator said the three executives have not agreed to the settlement, and that the case against them will proceed in federal court.  ""The companies also agreed to a judgment of $4.7 billion, which will be suspended to permit Celsius to return its remaining assets to consumers in bankruptcy proceedings,"" the FTC notice said.  Lawyers for Mashinsky, Celsius and the SEC did not immediately respond to a CoinDesk request for comment. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York is due to host a press conference on the indictment at 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time on Thursday.  Following the publication of this article, lawyers for Mashinsky told CoinDesk via email that he ""vehemently denies the allegations brought today"" and that ""he looks forward to vigorously defending himself in court against these baseless charges.""

42419920,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGa5t,1689252190,First Mover Americas: Crypto AI Tokens Rally After Musk Unveils New Company,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Artificial intelligence (AI) related crypto tokens posted gains after Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk on Wednesday unveiled a new AI company called xAI as an alternative to popular chatbot ChatGPT. SingularityNET (AGIX) rose 11% over the past 24-hours, while Fetch.ai (FET) climbed about 7% over the same time period. The team will be led by Musk and includes members that have previously worked at DeepMind, OpenAI, Google Research, Microsoft Research, Tesla, and the University of Toronto, according to the company website. The newly formed company will be a separate entity from Musk's X Corp., but xAI said it will work closely with his other companies. xAI will host Twitter Spaces chat on Friday, July 14th.  Merchants on messaging app Telegram are now able to accept payments in cryptocurrency as services provider Wallet expands beyond its chat-centric payments mechanism. Wallet, which is built on The Open Network (TON) blockchain, already allows crypto transfers between users in chats. Now it's letting merchants integrate cryptocurrency into the bots they use to accept payments, it said in an emailed announcement on Thursday. The system allows for payment for goods and services using tether (USDT), bitcoin (BTC) and toncoin (TON).  A group of Polygon founders and researchers proposed a token upgrade that would replace the network's MATIC token with POL. The move would allow POL to function as a single token for all Polygon-based networks, including the main Polygon blockchain, the Polygon zkEVM network, and various supernets – application-specific blockchains that run atop the main Polygon network. The proposal lifted MATIC as much as 2.6% to $0.747 in the first three minutes after the announcement. If the proposal is accepted, network validators will be able to support the operation of multiple chains using a single token.  Chart of the Day  The litecoin-bitcoin ratio looks to be recovering from its recent drubbing as focus shifts to Litecoin's mining reward halving due on Aug. 2.

According to data from CoinMarketCap, KAVA is currently down by 10.90%, representing the biggest loss of the day. In general, the total crypto market cap is down by 0.31%, with the market leader, Bitcoin (BTC), losing by 0.46% in the last 24 hours. This is while prominent tokens, such as Ripple (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Solana (SOL), have managed to stay afloat, recording no significant gain or loss. KAVA Price Action And Analysis KAVA began the week with sideways movement hovering around that $0.94 price region. However, after a slight price dip which saw the token retest at $0.91 on July 10, it embarked on a bullish run reaching as high as $1.02 the next day. Related Reading: PEPE Price Drops More Than 60% From ATH – What Lies Ahead? Following a consolidation at this zone for some hours, the token experienced a significant price boost yesterday, hitting a top price of $1.06. Albeit, since attaining this price level, KAVA has been on a downward trend returning to the price levels seen at the start of the week. Analyzing its 4-Hour chart, KAVA is currently in a strong consolidation zone, but if the bulls assume control of the market, the token could rise to the $1.06 price region, which has previously served as a strong resistance level. A sustained bullish momentum that results in the altcoin pushing past this level could lead to a market price in the region of $1.22. That said, if the current selling pressure remains strong, KAVA could drop from its consolidation zone, falling as low as $0.73. Based on CoinMarketCap data, KAVA is currently trading at $0.94, with a 0.16% gain in the last hour. Meanwhile, the token’s daily volume is down by 16.64% and now stands at $48 million. KAVA ranks as the 70th biggest cryptocurrency with a market cap value of $588 million.

42419914,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGa0j,1689250340,Coinbase Cut to Underweight Ahead of Earnings by Barclays,"Barclays (BCS) is revising its Coinbase (COIN) estimates ahead of earnings and downgrading the stock to underweight from equal weight, the bank said in a research report Thursday.  Still, the bank raised its price target for the crypto exchange’s stock to $70 from $61. Coinbase shares were quoted 1.4% lower at $84.79 in premarket trading at the time of publication.  Coinbase, which reports second-quarter earnings after the close on Aug. 8, has surprised to the upside on revenue and costs in recent quarters, but with volumes and USD Coin (USDC) market cap depressed, a regulatory crackdown and a powerful recent run-up in the share price, the bank sees few positive near-term drivers.  “While we continue to believe Coinbase is a likely long-term winner in the broader crypto ecosystem, fundamentals remain challenged, and recent relief from price actions, increasing rates, and cost rationalization likely have little further to run,” analysts led by Benjamin Budish wrote.  June exchange volumes were “modestly improved” from May, but overall second-quarter volumes were materially worse than in the first quarter, and July metrics are also trending lower month-on-month, the report said.  Barclays notes that while Coinbase shares have appreciated meaningfully following news of a BlackRock-sponsored spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded-fund (ETF) application, for which Coinbase is expected to be custodian and prime broker, it “does not think this accurately reflects the potential eventual P&L impact that could accrue to Coinbase.”  Read more: Investor Enthusiasm for Coinbase Shares May Prove Short-Lived: Berenberg",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Will Canny,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/13/coinbase-cut-to-underweight-ahead-of-earnings-by-barclays,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/649043528cc5421e0e4c362813e9c640a920ef06-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

14842856,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/blockchain-association-demand-sec-prometheum-investigation,1689249180,Blockchain Association Demands SEC-Prometheum Investigation,"The Blockchain Association has alleged that Prometheum’s Broker-Dealer license approval by the SEC is part of a “sweetheart deal” between the two. BA Appeals To SEC Inspector Prometheum Ember Capital, a Special Purpose Broker-Dealer (SPBD), has come under scrutiny due to potential impropriety surrounding its approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Blockchain Association (BA), a leading nonprofit organization advocating for a pro-innovation policy environment for the digital asset economy, has called for an investigation by the SEC's Office of Inspector General, Deborah Jeffrey. The group has alleged that Prometheum has benefitted from a “sweetheart deal” with the regulatory body, in which the former received license approval in return for co-CEO Aaron Kaplan’s testimony in the House Financial Services Committee in June. How Did Prometheum Obtain SEC Approval? The SEC has maintained an overtly hostile approach towards the digital assets industry, motivated by its Chair Gary Gensler's stance that all digital assets, except for Bitcoin, should be classified as securities. Amidst this hostility, Prometheum managed to obtain a first-of-its-kind license to operate as an SPBD, raising ethical concerns from several US lawmakers considering the circumstances surrounding it. The fact that the company has no working product or asset listings goes against the SEC’s recent actions against Coinbase and Binance, where it deemed that exchange, clearing, and broker-dealer functions should be separated into distinct entities. BA Alleges “Sweetheart Deal” In an effort to shed light on these matters, the Blockchain Association submitted a request under the Freedom of Information Act to the Commission on June 16, 2023, seeking relevant documents and communications. As the industry awaits answers, the Association urges the Office of Inspector General to initiate an investigation to uncover any impropriety or confirm the absence of any wrongdoing in these allegations. The investigation will serve to address the concerns raised and ensure transparency and fairness within the digital asset industry. The group has alleged that Prometheum received preferential treatment from the SEC because co-CEO Aaron Kaplan had testified before the Congress supporting the SEC’s stance that new legislation for digital assets is unnecessary. The association writes, “Prometheum…promotes the same false narrative propounded by Chair Gensler that there exists a clear pathway to registration for digital assets and legislation is unnecessary. Echoing this narrative, on June 13, 2023, co-CEO of Prometheum, Aaron Kaplan, testified before Congress, stating that new legislation is not in the best interest in the investing public or blockchain industry.” “SEC Chair Impeding Legislation Efforts”: BA Representing over 100 member companies like Circle, Kraken, and Digital Currency Group in the blockchain industry, the Blockchain Association aims to promote regulatory clarity and educate policymakers, regulators, courts, and the public about the benefits of blockchain technology. The Association is particularly concerned that Chair Gensler is using Prometheum and the SPBD licensure process to impede congressional efforts toward legislation by perpetuating the false narrative that the law is already clear regarding digital asset securities.

A giant whale with 101.47 trillion SHIB, valued at over $756 million at current prices, transferred 4 trillion SHIB, or $30 million, to eight fresh addresses today, Lookonchain said.  This wallet is considered to be the single-largest holder of SHIB tokens, the firm added. It first purchased $14,000 worth of SHIB tokens in the days following issuance and sold just under $20 million worth in 2021.  As such, data shows most SHIB market depth is under $1 million on various crypto exchanges, and a sell order of that value could move token prices by 2% immediately.  Meanwhile, analytics tool Bubblemaps tweeted the wallet was likely connected to the project’s developers. The firm referred to a January report that noted a group of wallets purchased 10% of shiba inu supply after issuance – but has, overall, continued to hold the tokens instead of selling to unsuspecting market participants.  SHIB prices are little changed in the past 24 hours.

At the same time, trading volumes and USCoin ( USDC-USD ) market cap are depressed and regulatory pressures cloud its outlook. The downgrade comes a day after Atlantic Equities cut its rating on the cryptocurrency exchange to Neutral after the stock surged 60% from recent lows. Coinbase ( COIN ) shares dropped 1.2% in Thursday premarket trading. ""While we continue to believe Coinbase ( COIN ) is a likely longer-term winner in the broader crypto ecosystem, fundamentals remain challenged, and recent relief from price actions, increasing rates, and cost rationalization likely have little further to run,"" Barclays analyst Benjamin Budish wrote in a note to clients. He noted that Q2 volumes were down 36% from Q1 and July metrics are trading worse M/M and that ""regulatory overhang is likely to last for some time."" In addition, competition could be ramping up as some TradFi-backed exchanges and others step into the sector. The downgrade came after Coinbase ( COIN ) shares climbed after the announcement of a BlackRock ( BLK )-sponsored spot bitcoin ETF, for which Coinbase is expected to be the custodian and prime broker. ""We do not think this accurately reflects the potential eventual P&L impact that could accrue to Coinbase,"" said Budish, adding that he thinks the rally was overdone. With the downgrade, his view on Coinbase ( COIN ) is more bearish than the SA Quant rating , average SA Analyst rating , and average Wall Street rating , all at Hold.

42419931,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGa4r,1689248209,Bitcoin Options Traders Shrug Off Post-CPI Choppy Price Action,"In financial markets, traders are constantly reading between the lines to gauge what's coming next. So when a rising market fails to respond to a positive piece of news, traders tend to take it as a sign of an impending trend reversal lower and become cautious.  But that's not always the case. Bitcoin's options market shows traders remain confident of the cryptocurrency's price prospects despite the choppy action in the wake of Wednesday's softer-than-expected U.S. consumer price inflation (CPI) data, which weakened the case for continued Fed tightening and powered traditional risk assets higher.  On Deribit, the dominant crypto options exchange, the call-put skews are still positive across all timeframes, signaling a persistent bullish bias, according to data source Amberdata.  A call option gives the purchaser the right to buy an asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date, an implicitly bullish outlook. A put option gives the right to sell. The call-put skew measures the spread between volatility pricing for bullish calls and bearish puts.  According to crypto over-the-counter institutional liquidity network Paradigm, traders snapped up bitcoin calls expiring in December during the post-CPI price drop to nearly $30,200 from $31,000. The bullish flow, however, was limited compared with the one seen during a similar price dip on Monday.  The options market turned decisively bullish on BTC after BlackRock's June 15 application for a spot-based bitcoin exchange-traded fund with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Since then, the positive mood in the options market has held intact, and bitcoin has rallied over 20%.  ""Only about a third of the open options positions in the market are puts, highlighting that crypto markets remain biased, as they have for a long time, towards calls,"" Lawrence Lewitinn, a director at The Tie, wrote in Wednesday's edition of the newsletter.  What next?  Bitcoin's inability to cheer the CPI figure has perplexed many observers, with some attributing the lack of upside to a large movement of coins previously seized from the notorious darknet marketplace Silk Road.  Analysts are confident the rally will soon resume with more demand flowing in once prices top the $31,000 mark.  ""In BTC, a move above 31,400 and a close above 31,000 are needed to unlock further demand and gains,"" Richard Usher, head of OTC trading at crypto payments services provider BCB Group told CoinDesk. ""The soft reading on the U.S. CPI should underpin the risk on tone across asset classes.""  Paradigm voiced a similar opinion, saying prices could rise to $35,000-$37,000.  ""BTC skew is calls > puts across the curve with flag patterns and Fibonacci retracements suggesting $35,000-$37,000 is the next stop if we can meaningful break the $31,000 resistance,"" Paradigm wrote.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/13/bitcoin-options-traders-shrug-off-post-cpi-choppy-price-action,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2718518532d44ce21ca34900a6fc31d58be88cfa-1704x987.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

14841292,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/crypto-market-wakes-up-following-lower-inflation-figures,1689245717,Crypto market wakes up following lower inflation figures,"A very welcome downtick in US inflation to 3% in June has led to a rally in stocks. Today, the crypto market has woken up and is trending higher. Crypto not moving on good inflation data? A report in the India-based Business Standard somewhat jumped the gun. It accused the crypto market of standing still as stocks and bonds increased in value following the perceived good news in the June inflation figure of 3%. Based on what was seen as the crypto market not making hay while global markets were doing just that, an analyst who commented in the article went as far as to suggest that this was a “bad sign” and that bitcoin’s odds of falling to $26,000 to $25,000 were increasing. Crypto wakes up Only one day later and crypto is painting a different story. Bitcoin suddenly shot out of its sideways slumber and is currently up 0.6%. It may be that it only increases to the top of the range at around $31,400 but the longer this accumulation phase lasts, the more explosive the resulting move is likely to be. USDT dominance has moved in the opposite direction which is probably only to be expected, and this has released the altcoins from their shackles of the last few days. Comparing the USDT dominance chart to Bitcoin shows the former to be on the brink of breaking down, while the latter is looking like breaking higher. The Total 3 chart, which includes all cryptocurrencies except bitcoin and ethereum, has just broken to the upside and is now under the next resistance at $334.5 billion. A break of this should lead to $345 billion and then potentially $352 billion. DoJ bitcoin overhang However, it’s not all blue skies ahead for crypto by any means. The overhang of the US Justice Department selling its bitcoin can dent the market. News broke recently that the next batch of 9000 BTC has been transferred to a new address, perhaps being made ready to be sold. The last same-size batch to be sold hardly made an impression as the market swallowed it and recovered immediately. The impact of this latest tranche remains to be seen, with 3 further tranches still to be sold by the end of this year. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies good long-term? Whether bitcoin and crypto go up or down over the next few weeks and months is generally immaterial. The dire state of the dollar and all other fiat currencies, as they continue to heavily lose their purchasing power, is a major reason to have at least some of one’s wealth in bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies are more speculative, but if it is accepted that they are bringing a huge technical revolution, not just to finance, but to many other areas of economic activity, then as things stand, this speculation may not be as risky as just holding fiat in the bank.

This anonymous early investor, who holds a staggering 10.15% of the total SHIB supply, has recently made significant moves, causing speculation within the community. The whale, identified by his address “0x140”, has been dormant for a staggering 157 days, but has now reawakened with a series of unprecedented transactions. In a span of just 24 hours, the whale distributed a whopping 4 trillion SHIB tokens, equivalent to a staggering $30 million, across nine new wallets. Detailed data from Etherscan confirms the veracity of the whale’s recent movement. The whale distributed precisely 4,000,000,000,107 SHIB tokens across nine new wallets within a 24-hour period. The transfers began with a small amount of 107 SHIB to a specific address, followed by subsequent transfers of 500,000,000,000 SHIB each to eight separate addresses. Shiba Inu Whale Provides A Shock This unexpected flurry of activity has captured the attention of analysts and on-chain experts. Lookonchain, a prominent crypto analytics expert, noted that this whale is likely the largest holder of SHIB, with a current holding of 101.47 trillion SHIB tokens, worth an astonishing $756 million. Furthermore, this early investor has a total of 23 wallets where the SHIB holdings are distributed. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Market Cap Climbs By $500 Million – Is A Price Rally On The Horizon? This colossal whale’s involvement in the SHIB ecosystem dates back to its early days. Spot On Chain, an on-chain analyst, revealed that the whale initially acquired a staggering 103.33T SHIB with a mere 38 ETH ($14,000) during its inception. Riding the wave of SHIB’s meteoric rise, this investment once reached a staggering valuation of $8.16 billion. In 2021, during the infamous SHIB price pump, the whale made strategic moves, reaping significant profits. Spot On Chain revealed that the whale exchanged approximately 1.9 trillion SHIB across various platforms, including Binance, Coinbase, and MEXC, at an average price of $0.00000969 in July 2021. This savvy maneuver resulted in an estimated profit of $18.49 million. Notably, the whale also executed a substantial sale of 603 billion SHIB tokens for 2,411 ETH, equivalent to $9.6 million at the time. Additionally, the whale deposited a staggering 1.25 trillion SHIB, worth $8.77 million, into Coinbase during the same year. SHIB Breakout Not Confirmed Yet The recent flurry of activity by this influential whale has left the SHIB community speculating about the intentions behind these transactions. With the distribution of such a massive amount of SHIB tokens, there are growing concerns and uncertainties among SHIB proponents. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Ecosystem Token BONE Surges 88%, Too Late To Buy? As the market keeps a keen eye on this whale’s next moves, it is evident that the impact of this early investor cannot be underestimated. Holding 10% of the total SHIB supply, this whale wields significant influence over the market and has the potential to trigger substantial fluctuations in SHIB’s price. At press time, the SHIB price stood at $0.00000752. The breakout from the downward trend (yellow circle) that has been in place since the beginning of February has thus still not been confirmed. Also, the longer the price does not make a decisive move towards the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.0000083, the more likely it becomes that the SHIB price will remain in bearish territory.

42419915,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGZzh,1689242400,"Ethereum Tops New Crypto ESG Ranking, Bitcoin Slammed for Heavy Energy Usage","Ethereum topped the first institutional-grade crypto ESG ranking followed by Solana and Cardano, while Bitcoin lagged due to its heavy energy usage, according to crypto data firm CCData’s research.  CCData’s inaugural ESG Benchmark, created in unison with the Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute (CCRI), was published on Thursday. It evaluated 40 of the largest, most liquid digital assets assessing parameters such as decentralization, security and climate impact.  The role of environmental, social and governance (ESG) mandates in investments is becoming increasingly prevalent, especially among institutional investors and large asset management firms. ESG-related assets under management could reach 33.9 trillion by 2026, a fifth of all investments globally, global accounting firm PricewaterhouseCooper (PwC) forecasted in a report late last year.  Attendees at CoinDesk’s Consensus conference said that if crypto wants to capture new institutional money, it should also embrace ESG instead of hiding from it, the Consensus @ Consensus report found. Notably, asset management giant BlackRock, which is at the forefront of the push to register a spot bitcoin ETF, is a large proponent of ESG-focused investments.  Read more: If Crypto Wants Institutional Dollars, It Needs an ESG Game Plan: Consensus 2023 Attendees  CCData created the new crypto-focused scoring framework to cater to this increased demand.  “The ESG Benchmark is a critical first step toward improving the resilience of the industry in the face of ESG challenges and criticisms from regulators, policymakers and media, who consider ESG requirements a top priority,” the report said.  The benchmark measured environmental, social and governance risks for and opportunities of digital assets, taking into account a range of metrics including decentralization, energy consumption, community engagement. Then, the points for each metric were aggregated and weighted for an overall score of maximum 100 points, making up the final grade from AA (best) and E (worst).  Assets with a BB or better grade were considered top-tier in the report.  Ethereum was the only blockchain that earned an AA grade, performing well in all three ESG factors. This is partly attributed to the network’s recent transition to proof-of-stake technology, according to the report, which slashed energy consumption and made miners obsolete.  Solana, Cardano and Polkadot excelled in decentralization, granting them a top-tier A grade.  Bitcoin received a B grade, earning high scores in social and governance aspects but slammed for its heavy energy consumption and hardware need.  “This grading does not connote overall superiority, instead it represents a means of ranking digital assets according to ESG parameters,” the report said. “[It] equips investors with the tools needed to make informed decisions and allocate resources to assets which hold strong ESG scores.",POSITIVE,없음,ADA | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/13/ethereum-tops-new-crypto-esg-ranking-bitcoin-slammed-for-heavy-energy-usage,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f25d6ef71c5a102283c6b70b535c1cf89c92e643-2240x1208.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

14839900,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/dusk-s-preparedness-for-mica-compliance,1689242400,Dusk's Preparedness for MiCA Compliance,"The European Union recently approved the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA), which came into force in June 2023, bringing crypto assets, crypto asset issuers, and crypto asset service providers under a single regulatory framework. The MiCA regulations introduce increased transparency and create a comprehensive regulatory framework for service providers and issuers and compliance with anti-money laundering rules. Additionally, the new rules also cover asset-referenced tokens and stablecoins. A Closer Look At MiCA MiCA, or the Markets in Crypto Assets, is the new legislation adopted by the European Union on cryptocurrency, aiming to bring greater clarity to the crypto ecosystem in the EU. The introduction of the Markets in Crypto Assets legislation represents a significant step forward for the crypto industry and is the most significant effort yet to bring transparency to the sector. MiCA will provide stakeholders with a clear set of rules, definitions, and guidelines for companies operating in different spheres of the crypto space, such as custody, trading, and marketing of crypto assets. MiCA also puts significant emphasis on stablecoins, which are digital assets whose value is typically backed by fiat currency, although they could be backed by other assets as well. It introduces heavy compliance requirements for stablecoin operators, thus ensuring that these assets are stable, secure, and not subjected to any fraud. MiCA also requires entities offering crypto assets to provide a whitepaper that contains information about the issuer, obligations, capital raised, and the underlying technology behind the asset. According to MiCA, this would help improve transparency and fuel technological innovation. MiCA also mandates the recording of all sender and recipient information, regardless of the transaction amount. Against the backdrop of this emphasis on regulatory compliance, how will companies that operate with a focus on privacy operate? Striking A Balance Protocols must take a unique and innovative approach to ensure compliance with MiCA, with transactions conducted on their platform being private and secure but also auditable by the concerned authorities. As such, it is important for protocols to strike a balance between user privacy and regulatory requirements. For example, Dusk encrypts the user key with an auditor key. This means only the auditor can decrypt it. Users can utilize zero-knowledge proofs to prove that the auditor key was used to encrypt the user key. This innovative approach ensures compliance by combining digital identity, privacy, and encryption. The new EU regulations are expected to considerably impact those protocols that do not have simultaneous privacy and auditability at the base layer. Protocols that are privacy-focused and do not feature built-in auditability will face considerable difficulties when it comes to gaining traction in the European Union. Many public and anonymous tokens will also face considerable challenges. How Dusk Is Ready To Comply With MiCA Dusk believes that regulatory clarity is critical for the broader adoption of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. The approval of the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation rules by the European Union is a significant step towards achieving greater regulatory compliance and clarity in the crypto space.

Wallet, which is built on The Open Network (TON) blockchain, already allows crypto transfers between users in chats. Now it's letting merchants integrate cryptocurrency into the bots they use to accept payments, it said in an emailed announcement on Thursday. The system allows for payment for goods and services using tether (USDT), bitcoin (BTC) and toncoin (TON).  ""In the past, DIY solutions have been available in the form of relatively primitive bots with links to cryptocurrency payment systems or similar products attached to them,"" the Wallet team told CoinDesk. ""With WalletPay, merchants can now seamlessly accept cryptocurrency payments within the Telegram app, with features available such as the ability to make payments directly within chats.”  While the provision for crypto services within Telegram began over a year ago by making the sending and receiving of it in theory as simple as sending an instant message, it's still not been widely adopted. Just 2 million of the more than 700 million Telegram members use Wallet services, the payments provider said.  Telegram's cryptocurrency journey goes back some years to its development of the TON blockchain project. This development was abandoned in 2020, however, owing to legal battles with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  TON was kept alive by members of its community, calling themselves The TON Foundation, who have continued to advance the project.

This substantial downturn has dealt a heavy blow to optimistic investors who were aiming to capitalize on their impressive triple-digit profits from June. The latest insights from on-chain data suggest massive whale movement. In light of these developments, a pressing question arises: What lies ahead for the PEPE price, and what can be expected in the future? Trader Accumulates PEPE: A Long-Term Investment? Amidst the crypto community’s ongoing speculation, Lookonchain recently unveiled a noteworthy transaction involving trader “osf_rekt.” It appeared as though osf_rekt was making a conscious effort to maintain ownership of the assets as the user traded 141 Ethereum (ETH) for a staggering 173 billion units of the popular meme coin, PEPE. We noticed that @osf_rekt spent 141 $ETH ($265K) to buy 173B $PEPE again 16 hrs ago and transferred 690B $PEPE($1.05M) to a safe multisig wallet. He spent a total of 536 $ETH ($1.04M) to buy 613B $PEPE from June 14 to July 11, with an average buying price of $0.00000169. pic.twitter.com/jDzdf0JVvu — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 12, 2023 What makes this transaction even more intriguing is that it was not the first instance of osf_rekt acquiring PEPE. This pattern of behavior by the trader using a pseudonym implies, in most cases, that they have a fundamental view that the cryptocurrency has positive prospects. Considering the widespread buzz surrounding PEPE, this accumulation of tokens by osf_rekt does not come as a surprise. However, it is worth noting that PEPE has experienced a recent decline in value. Over the past seven days alone, its value has depreciated by 14.7%, with a 24-hour slump of 2.8%, ultimately placing its current price at $0.00000150, as reported by CoinGecko. Source: Coingecko Declining User Adoption And Network Growth In addition, a PEPE price report notes that the meme coin has witnessed a concerning trend of dwindling user adoption. This is evident from the data provided by Santiment, which highlights a substantial decrease in the number of new users joining the PEPE network over the course of one week.

The Online Safety Bill, brought forward on March 17, is nearing the final stages of approval before passing into law.  The metaverse, a superset of virtual realities, has gained widespread popularity in the last few years, with social media giant Facebook even rebranding to Meta to show its commitment to developing the sector. These virtual worlds also pose a risk to child safety, some regulators have argued.  “These virtual reality experiences are very immersive and the degree of harm that can be created and indeed the degree of enjoyment can be that much more intense,” Melanie Dawes, CEO at Ofcom, the U.K.'s communications regulator said during an event in October.  Through filming and analyzing 100 visits to the most popular worlds in Meta's flagship platform, Horizon Worlds, the Centre for Countering Digital Hate found that minors are routinely harassed.  Given the potential harm children can face in these virtual reality experiences, lawmakers in the U.K.'s House of Lords argued it was significant to ensure that the Online Safety Bill applied to the metaverse.  “The metaverse is in scope of the bill, which, as noble Lords know, has been designed to be technology neutral and future-proofed to ensure that it keeps pace with emerging technologies,” Lord Stephen Parkinson who is also a minister at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, said at a Wednesday debate on the bill. The department was also responsible for ushering in the Online Safety Bill.  The bill applies to “anything communicated by means of an internet service,” which includes things like objects or avatars created by users as well as interactions between users in the metaverse, Parkinson said.

The proposal lifted MATIC, which added as much as 2.6% to $0.747 in the first three minutes after the announcement.  If the proposal is accepted, network validators will be able to support the operation of multiple chains using a single token.  The upgrade to POL from MATIC requires a simple technical action – sending MATIC to the upgrade smart contract, which will automatically return the equivalent amount of POL. Token holders would be given ample time to upgrade, a proposed four years or more, if the community supports the move.  Every Polygon chain’s community will ultimately decide which token their chain will use for gas fees; some of them might choose POL.

14838192,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542472,1689238816,Galaxy Digital Founder Anticipates BTC Price Surge Due To This Reason,"Mike Novogratz, founder of Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd., recently gave his views about Bitcoin’s future and the anticipated approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, providing a glimpse into what might be in store for the world of crypto. Novogratz’s insights, shared during an interview on Bloomberg TV, come at a crucial time when the crypto market is in flux, sandwiched between mounting regulatory concerns and a growing interest from mainstream investors. BTC On An Upward Trajectory Mike Novogratz paints a promising future for Bitcoin in the coming months. According to his predictions, the digital currency is set to witness a price surge by the end of the year. His focus is currently on Bitcoin’s consolidation between the price brackets of $28,000 and $32,000. Related Reading: Standard Chartered Raises Bitcoin Forecast To $120,000, Citing Miners’ Reduced Selling An interesting element of Novogratz’s prediction is the anticipated impact of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. He foresees a likely upward swing in Bitcoin’s value following the conclusion of the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate hikes. The prevalent market conditions, according to Novogratz, have been influenced by ‘supply pressure.’ So he suggests that significant profits realized by some investors are largely responsible for this situation. This viewpoint aligns with common investment market dynamics, where notable financial gains often result in an increase in selling pressure. Novogratz points out that this trend is playing out in the current Bitcoin market. Anticipating Bitcoin ETF Approval Mike Novogratz’s forecast for the future of Bitcoin doesn’t stop at predicting its market value. He also envisions the potential approval of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) within the United States. This breakthrough could fundamentally alter the crypto investment landscape. If this approval becomes a reality, it would pave the way for industry heavyweights such as BlackRock Inc. and Invesco. These investment titans could introduce Bitcoin to a more extensive investor base, including those who previously had no access to this asset class. In Novogratz’s view, such approval would act as a ‘seal of approval’ from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the US government. This validation would further establish Bitcoin’s credibility as an asset. Turning to the topic of his own firm, Galaxy Digital Holdings, Novogratz gave insights into their pursuit of a US listing. He acknowledged that the process is in progress, but admitted that the journey has been slow and ‘frustrating.’ Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Soar To $140,000 In Next Bull Cycle, Crypto Analysis Channel The Toronto-listed company has plans to reincorporate in Delaware with an eye to subsequently list on Nasdaq.

Coinbase, one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchange platforms, has launched an encrypted messaging service on its self-custodial wallet app. This messaging feature has been built using the open-source Web3 messaging network of Texas-based startup XMTP. This service will be initially made available to a small group of users. Ethereum addresses will be able to communicate with each other in a human-readable manner. What can be done with the wallet? The message feature allows NFT and POAP holders to connect with others who own the same digital assets through direct messaging. This feature will elevate the wallet from mere key holders into a highly interactive platform. It may even evolve into become identities for the wallet holders. All messaging is encrypted, ensuring user privacy. Coinbase isn't the first with the messaging feature Coinbase isn't the first to explore Web3 messaging, but it definitely is the largest one so far. Coinbase wallet has a staggering 1.3 million users worldwide. Using the wallet, Coinbase users will be able to move over their conversations from any of the ~450 applications built on XMTP to the Coinbase Wallet. Do note that the messages aren't recorded on-chain, meaning they are not stored as transactions. Instead, XMTP messages travel across nodes managed by XMTP Labs. What can you do with messaging feature? Users can leverage the messaging feature to make crypto payments, similar to PayPal's Venmo or Block’s Cash App. While the feature will support ""thousands of coins"" at launch, users who conduct transactions in the USDC stablecoin won't have to pay gas fees. Coinbase wallet users will also have access to personalized wallet labels through Coinbase Decentralized ID (cb.id) – created in collaboration with the Ethereum Name Service (ENS).

42393126,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgGO7L,1689237288,Coinbase Lawyers Argue Biden Student Loans Ruling Aids Defense Against SEC,"A recent U.S. Supreme Court judgment on student debt cancellation aids Coinbase’s fight against charges of operating an unregistered securities venue, lawyers for the crypto exchange argued in a Wednesday legal filing.  On June 6, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Coinbase with breaching federal securities law. The exchange says the lawsuit is a bid by the regulator to exert “extraordinary wholesale power” over the $1 trillion digital asset industry and represents a breach of powers of the kind judges recently ruled unlawful.  It's referring to a Supreme Court ruling on June 30, just days after Coinbase sent its opening defense, that the Secretary of Education had overstepped his authority by canceling around $430 billion in student debt, reinforcing a legal doctrine that says that government agencies need clear support from Congress if taking a decision of major economic or political significance.  Coinbase says that “closely analogous” case, cited as Biden v. Nebraska, will have a bearing on its own, because lawmakers still haven’t set out clear rules for crypto.  “Far from granting the ‘clear congressional authorization’ required for the SEC to exercise such authority, Congress has expressly recognized that it has not yet delegated such regulatory authority and is actively considering regulatory structures for the digital asset industry,” said Coinbase’s filing.  U.S. lawmakers are considering a range of digital asset laws, including a recently revived bipartisan bill by Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) which favors giving authority to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) rather than the SEC.  The SEC has argued that digital assets including the tokens tied to Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC) constitute regulated securities, and that the Coinbase knew it was violating the law by failing to register its activities. The regulator has also made similar allegations against rivals Binance and Bittrex. All three companies have denied the charges, arguing the regulator has no jurisdiction.  The parties meet later Thursday for a preliminary hearing in a New York courtroom in a trial that could potentially drag on for years. In a separate case, Coinbase recently scored a Supreme Court victory when judges ruled that a lawsuit taken against the exchange by a user couldn’t proceed until after an appeal.

14836853,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542485,1689235257,Why Is Bitcoin And Crypto Down Today?,"Within the last 24 hours, Bitcoin and the entire crypto market are experiencing a slight downturn, leaving investors wondering about the reasons behind this dip. Bitcoin briefly rose to $31,009 before falling to 30,254 within a few hours. Ether (ETH) rose to over $1,900, only to drop back to $1,868. CPI Data And The Anticipation Of A Rate Hike One crucial piece of the puzzle lies in the recent Consumer Price Index (CPI) data. Yesterday’s CPI data for June was a positive surprise as the headline CPI year-over-year (YoY) fell to 3.0%, coming in below expectations of 3.1%. Even more encouraging was core CPI YoY which dropped to 4.8%, surpassing market expectations of 5.0%. Related Reading: CPI Data For June Is A Bullish Surprise For Bitcoin And Crypto However, this didn’t significantly alter the market’s view on the upcoming rate hike decision by the Federal Reserve at the end of the month. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, the market still expects a 25 bps hike by the Fed at the next meeting on July 25-26 with a 93% probability. Renowned macro analyst Ted (@tedtalksmacro) is in the minority that believes there won’t be another rate hike. Ted shared the chart below and wrote: 3m annualized core CPI now running at October 2021 levels. The trend is the Fed’s friend. Hard to see another hike this month. Other analysts, however, believe that the core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is more important for the Fed. In the most recent release of FOMC minutes, PCE is mentioned ten times compared vs. three mentions of CPI. The Fed’s favored inflation gauge for June will not be released until 28 July. US Government Selling Bitcoin However, it is important to note that following the positive inflation data, traditional markets were setting new highs. The S&P500 rose by 0.74% yesterday and recorded its highest level since April 2022. Meanwhile, Bitcoin still could’t sustainably break $31,000 in its 6th attempt. Related Reading: Silk Road’s Ghosts Haunt Bitcoin Market As US Government Moves 9,800 BTC The reason was likely the news that the US government is moving 9,800 BTC linked to the infamous Silk Road marketplace. The news broke shortly after the release of the CPI and drastically dampened sentiment. In the past, news that the US government is moving and possibly selling some of its Bitcoin always triggered severe price drops. Yesterday’s drop can still be considered moderate and an indicator of market strength. So far, there is only speculation about the US government’s plans. It is known that the US intends to liquidate the seized BTC holdings. The last time this happened was in March. Back then, 9,861 Bitcoin were sold. However, the transfers could also only be used to restructure the BTC holdings. Probably the reason #Bitcoin couldn’t rally despite the positive CPI surprise (SPX +0.83%). 👇 https://t.co/93iiWlHNvm — Jake Simmons (@realJakeSimmons) July 12, 2023 BTC Stuck In Range Additionally, the market activity itself is playing a significant role. Traders actively engage in strategies such as longing at the bottom and shorting at the top of the current Bitcoin range. As analyst Skew aptly puts it, “Most are playing the range well, hedging near range highs & flipping long around range lows.” This trading behavior creates a dynamic environment where short-term price movements can be influenced by the actions of traders seeking to capitalize on market volatility. Skew added: BTC Aggregate CVDs & Delta still a very derivative driven market with lack of spot participation yet = chop chop. Decent long sweep around $30.2K + demand between current price & $30K. Could see a take profit or short covering bounce some time later today. At press time, the BTC price was at $30,431 and remained comfortably in the trading range between $29,800 and $31,300.

The government has plans to sell the remaining BTC in batches over the year. It looks like the U.S. Department of Justice(DoJ) is finally moving the BTC reserves it seized from the Silk Road. The notorious online marketplace, which was predominantly used for illicit activities and operated using Bitcoin for transactions, was taken down by U.S. authorities in October 2013. Here is what Wu Blockchain tweeted: ""Breaking: The Silk Road BTC-related addresses which are suspected to be seized by the US Department of Justice, are transferring more than 9k BTC. https://oklink.com/btc/address/bc1qmxjefnuy06v345v6vhwpwt05dztztmx4g3y7wp?tab=commonTxThe U.S. government previously sold 9,800 BTC on March 14 and said it plans to sell another 41,500 BTC related to Silk Road in four batches within a year."" In November 2022, the US DoJ seized >50,000 bitcoins from James Zhong – the infamous Silk Road hacker. The transfer was noted across two addresses linked with the DoJ, while the remaining portion of the Bitcoin haul remained untouched. As per Wu Blockchain, the U.S. government plans to sell the remaining bitcoins over the year. Transactions facing confirmations delays These transactions faced confirmation delays mainly due to the low transaction fees allocated by the DoJ. The DoJ has made two transactions with a combined $8 in transaction fees. The last time they sold the government sold the seized BTC, they paid over $215,000 in transaction fees, as per court filings. Interestingly, many have noted that by liquidating bitcoin instead of holding on to it, the government has missed out on $5.6 billion. As the practice of seizing cryptocurrencies from illegal activities becomes more common, the financial implications of how and when to sell these assets will become increasingly significant.

42393127,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgGOCT,1689233050,Stader Labs Debuts Ether Staking Product With 6% Yield,"Non-custodial multi-chain liquid staking platform Stader Labs has expanded to Ethereum this week with a product that it says gives the highest yield on ether (ETH) staking compared to other protocols.  Unlike native Ethereum staking, which requires holders to lock up a minimum of 32 ETH, Stader said it would let node operators maintain the network with just 4 ETH — or an 85% lower capital commitment. It's a 4 ether bond, on which Stader issues an ETHx token, which can be used to represent the entire stake. The remaining 28 ether comes from liquid stakers.  Stader is offering its users a 50% reward boost resulting in a reward rate of over 6%. Meanwhile, with 8x leverage, node operators using Stader’s service can earn up to 35% more yields on their staked ETH.  Popular staking services such as Lido and RocketPool hold a cumulative $15.5 billion worth of ether, with yields ranging from 3% to 4% as of Thursday, data shows.  Staking refers to locking up tokens for a set period of time to maintain network operations of the blockchain, usually in return for token rewards. Such products are widely considered to be a passive investment strategy for investors, comparable to a savings bank.  However, the large presence of these protocols has drawn criticism from some developers, particularly with respect to centralization, which Stader is trying to address.  “While the Ethereum staking ecosystem is already mature and features multiple protocols and services, it's somewhat centralized today as the top three entities have more than 50% ETH staked on them while the predominant liquid staking protocol has roughly 90% market share,” said Amitej Gajjala, CEO at Stader Labs, told CoinDesk in a message.  “To help alleviate these challenges and maintain our pledge to keep Ethereum decentralized, Stader has imposed a self-limit of 22% share of all staked ETH to mitigate centralization and promote a fair and balanced distribution of power among Ethereum staking solutions,” Gajjala added.  The popularity of liquid staking has been rapidly rising over the past months. In Q1 2023 alone, liquid staking was one of the fastest growing parts of the DeFi sector, showing a 210.9% increase in market capitalization, making it the third largest category in DeFi, according to CoinGecko.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | MINING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/07/13/stader-labs-debuts-ether-staking-product-with-6-yield,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1bf2c6f821ad0fde81c87fd679a2a059997eb245-4516x2540.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Data from Coinalyze shows futures traders are likely responsible for keeping the gains under check.  The first failed attempt on Monday at 20:05 UTC saw prices clock a high of $31,040 before quickly retreating back to $20,200 by 21:55 UTC. Open interest or the number of active stablecoin-margined (or linear) futures contracts tied to bitcoin rose from roughly 230,000 BTC to 242,000 BTC as prices pulled back from $31,040.  A rise in open interest alongside a decline in price is said to indicate an influx of bearish short positions in the market. Futures short positions are leveraged bets that profit from a decline in the underlying asset's price.  ""Price action suggested shorts piling in as we approached $31,000,"" crypto liquidity network Paradigm said in a market update published Tuesday, drawing attention to the uptick in open interest as prices turned lower from $31,040.  A similar pattern was seen on Wednesday following the release of the softer-than-expected U.S. consumer price index (CPI) report that weakened the case for continued monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve.  Bitcoin printed a high of $31,000 immediately after the U.S. Labor Department released the CPI at 12:30 UTC only to fall back to $30,500 in the next one hour.  The retreat was once again accompanied by an increase in open interest in stablecoin-margined futures contracts.  The bearish activity around $31,000 has established the said level as key resistance to watch out for in the short-term.

This remarkable achievement has propelled SHIB to claim the 18th position among the largest cryptocurrencies. Over the course of the past month, SHIB has witnessed a substantial increase in market capitalization. From June 13 up until today, there has been a surge of approximately half a billion dollars, elevating the market cap from a modest $3.9 billion to its current impressive level. Such a substantial rise in market capitalization prompts speculation regarding the potential impact on the price of SHIB. As the SHIB market cap continues to grow, it can create a sense of optimism among investors, potentially leading to increased demand and upward price pressure for the token. Shiba Inu market cap movement. Source: CoinMarketCap Potential Impact On Shiba Inu Price Market capitalization plays a significant role in determining the value and potential growth of a cryptocurrency like Shiba Inu. When a crypto coin’s market capitalization improves, it can have several implications for its price. Let’s explore the potential impact of an improved market capitalization on the price of SHIB. Related Reading: Cardano Development Activity Dropping – What Does It Mean For ADA Price? As the market capitalization of SHIB grows, it indicates a rising level of investor confidence in the cryptocurrency. A higher market capitalization often attracts more investors who believe in the project’s potential. This increased demand can exert upward pressure on the price of SHIB, driving it higher. SHIB market cap currently at $4.47 billion. Chart: TradingView.com An improved market capitalization generally leads to increased liquidity for a cryptocurrency.

Network security remains a perennial cause of concern in the crypto markets.  The hard fork is forecasted to occur on 19th July 2023. at 6:00 UTC. A hard fork refers to a permanent change in the way a network operates by way of a software upgrade. No new BNB tokens will be issued for this upgrade, and two-thirds of all BNB Chain validators will need to upgrade their nodes to process blocks following the upgrade.  Validators are entities that utilize computing power to process transactions and maintain network security via nodes, or blockchain software.  Developers said in the BEP-255 proposal that user balance changes will be tracked in each block and will be reconciled to identify issues. In case of a reconciliation error, the blockchain will “panic” and stop producing new blocks.  “If a reconciliation error occurs, the blockchain will stop producing new blocks, impacting downstream services such as bridges, deposits, and withdrawals on exchanges,” developers wrote on GitHub. “This drastic action is necessary to protect the chain and its users, so core developers and community members should investigate the issue as soon as possible.”  Such methods could help users’ token holding at times of exploits, such as those occurring during bridge attacks.  Bridges are blockchain-based tools that allow users to transfer tokens between different networks.

Lawyers on behalf of FTX Trading Ltd. and Maclaurin Investments Ltd. (owned by Alameda Research, the hedge fund arm of the bankrupt FTX empire) asked the court to order the return of funds transferred to Patrick Gruhn, Robin Matzke, Brandon Williams, and Lorem Ipsum UG, the leadership of FTX Europe.  Sam Bankman-Fried and the FTX Group had paid approximately $323.5 million in return for the acquisition of Swiss Company DAAG, which would ultimately come to be known as FTX Europe. The lawyers alleged that the company had limited business and no intellectual property beyond a ""business plan.""  ""FTX Insiders pursued the DAAG acquisition because they believed DAAG’s founders could provide access to European regulators that would allow FTX to obtain the necessary licenses for activities in the European Economic Area, and because they wanted to benefit Williams and Matzke, who had preexisting relationships with Bankman-Fried,"" the filing said.  The lawyers alleged that the FTX Europe leadership received excessive earn-out payments of nearly $100 million in connection with acquiring K-DNA, an entity already licensed to operate in the European Economic Area and which was later incorporated into FTX Europe, for only €2 million.  The lawyers have also asked the court to stop the payment of any amount still remaining to be paid to the FTX Europe leadership. The deal was for more than $376 million, of which $52.5 million is the obligation still remaining, the filing said.  The lawyers argued that FTX Europe lacks value as an asset and is unable to be sold. In April, a Swiss court approved a request by FTX to explore the sale of FTX Europe.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $30,357, down 0.8% over the past 24 hours. BTC surged in the hour immediately following the CPI release, a 3% increase that was lower than expected and down from 4% the previous month, as investors quickly lost their enthusiasm. On-chain data this morning that showed two wallets – labeled as belonging to the U.S. government and linked to seized bitcoin holdings from the Silk Road marketplace – moving 9,825 bitcoin ($301 million) in three transactions may have outweighed the positive inflation report.  With a few blips, bitcoin has been range-bound between $30,000 and $31,000 for much of the time since June 20 as investors fretted over a renewal of hawkish interest rate hikes that could cast the economy into a steep recession. Federal Reserve officials have said repeatedly that they intend on raising interest rates 25 basis points (bps) later this month after pausing a year-long diet of monetary hawkishness in June.  Those worries and often confounding macroeconomic data have trumped euphoria that bubbled up earlier in June after BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, and other financial services giants applied for elusive spot bitcoin ETFs. The SEC, which has rejected multiple such applications over the past two years, is unlikely to come to a decision any time soon, leaving markets unclear about the next price catalyst. Still, sentiment has turned bullish with two respected research groups over the past week that BTC could soar to $120,000 or higher by the end of 2024 and other signals, including the CoinDesk bitcoin market indicator pointing upward.  In a Telegram message to CoinDesk, Strahinja Savic, head of data and analytics at Toronto-based crypto platform FRNT Financial, noted that over the past two years, the supply of BTC that remains unmoved for more than a year has reached an all-time high of nearly 70%. ""This data suggests that the dominant bitcoin investor right now is the long-term ‘hodler,’ Savic wrote. ""This cohort is less likely to be sensitive to macro considerations.""  Read More: Bitcoin HODLing Has Never Been More Popular  Ether also rose after the CPI release, before dropping and was recently changing hands at $1,870, down 0.6% from Tuesday, same time. Other major cryptos were largely in the red with MATIC and AVAX, the tokens of smart contracts platform Polygon and Avalanche, down more than 4% and 2%, respectively. The Crypto Market Index, a measure of crypto markets' performance, was off 1.9%.  Equity markets liked the sound of falling inflation better than cryptos with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite falling 1.1% and the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) also declining. Traditional safe haven gold ticked upward slightly.  FRNT's Savic noted stocks' and cryptos veering path, a trend that took flight months ago. ""We’ve seen a decline in correlations between bitcoin and traditional assets heading into this CPI release, and that has been a strong theme in 2023,"" he wrote.

Echoing a Wall Street Journal op-ed that he and former Securities and Exchange Commissioner (SEC) Jay Clayton co-authored last week, Massad said that the CFTC and SEC could create basic investor and market protection standards for exchanges through a self-regulatory organization as an incremental step before determining digital assets’ status.  “We're very deliberately saying, we don't have to resolve that in order to put in place some basic investor protection standards,” Massad said. “We're not saying that's not an important issue. It is and I don't want to limit the SE C's ability to say, this (crypto) is a security (and) you really have to comply. But what we're saying is, look, we have platforms today that are trading things – maybe they're securities, maybe they're commodities. Put in place standards on protecting customer assets, preventing fraud and manipulation, prohibiting conflicts of interest requiring reporting and recording of information.”  Massad and Clayton’s recommendations come at a potentially pivotal time in crypto’s brief history, and amid an ongoing jurisdictional feud between the CFTC, which considers crypto a commodity and the SEC, which sees it as a security. Both agencies have filed multiple legal actions against exchanges and other key crypto organizations, testing the applicability of current regulations but leaving investors and entrepreneurs deeply unsettled about crypto’s future in the U.S., which has largely spearheaded global interest in the space. Last month, the SEC sued Binance and Coinbase, saying the exchanges had violated securities laws by, among other things, offering unregistered securities.  Read More: SEC Sues Crypto Exchange Binance and CEO Changpeng Zhao, Alleging Multiple Securities Violations  Some observers believe that U.S. overreach could shift the balance of the crypto world to cities overseas with friendlier regulatory environments, including Hong Kong, which recently made it easier for retail investors to trade, Singapore and Abu Dhabi, which is intent on becoming a global digital asset hub.  Read More: Singapore: The Center of Asian Crypto Wealth Is Ready for a Reset  Massad said that the piecemeal approach would offer at least some certainty while the various cases wind their way through the courts, and agencies continue to debate over the nature of crypto. “Cases brought by the SEC and the CFTC aren't going to bring us to sort of comprehensive investor protection standards quickly,” he noted.  Massad said that Congress could apply the incremental standards to any platform trading bitcoin or ether, which account for more than two-thirds of the crypto market’s total value, as a sort of test. “There's no platform out there that's significant, that's not trading both of those tokens,” he said. “So that's the hook. That's the way to say, ‘here are the intermediaries that these standards apply to without having to resolve what's a security and what's not a security.”  He added: “We're going to say ‘look, that can still be litigated and let's require these platforms to provide some basic disclosure on a token before it's listed for trading.’ And that actually will help us determine what's a security. You can't really answer what's a security unless you know is there a common enterprise behind this, are there managerial efforts that people are looking toward to increase its value? We need disclosure to figure that out?”  Important events.  8:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(12:30 p.m. UTC): Producer Price Index (June/MoM/YoY)  8:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(12:30 p.m. UTC): Initial Jobless Claims (July 7)  CoinDesk TV  In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:  Bitcoin Nears $31K as Inflation Rose Less Than Expected; Crypto Oversight Bill Re-Launch  The U.S. inflation rate as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) slipped to 3.0% on a year-over-year basis in June from 4.0% in May.

Xterio plans to use the funding to further game and technology development, including artificial intelligence (AI) integration and the launch of its tokens.  Binance Labs is the investment arm of Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading value, according to CoinMarketCap data. While the exchange has faced increasing regulatory scrutiny, Binance Labs has continued to invest in companies and recently grew its assets to $9 billion.  Xterio offers a free-to-play gaming platform and a GameFi-as-a-service product that helps developer partners create third-party games. The startup now plans to expand its AI-driven interactive experience and develop an AI toolkit that can generate consistent production-quality 2D and 3D assets.  “The Xterio ecosystem is expanding faster than ever and bridges free-to-play genres with on-chain gaming enhanced by AI capabilities,” said Yi He, co-founder of Binance and head of Binance Labs. “The Xterio core team brings together experienced Web2 professionals with Web3 expertise; we look forward to closely working with them to allow gamers around the world to experience rich on-chain gameplay.”  Xterio previously raised a $40 million round in August 2022 that was co-led by Makers Fund, XPLA and the now defunct FTX Ventures. As part of the new strategic partnership, Binance Labs will support Xterio’s growth and the startup's token will become part of the BNB Chain ecosystem.
