Together with Parity Technologies, the firm plans to provide custody for the Polkadot ecosystem, offering digital asset storage services for financial institutions. The two plan to offer staking of DOT, Polkadot's native token in order to further expand the network's reach among institutions.  Zodia Custody is majority owned by multinational bank Standard Chartered and also counts SBI Holdings and Northern Trust among its shareholders, giving it considerable significance in the context of institutional adoption of digital assets. It expanded to Singapore earlier this week.  Polkadot's DOT token is the 13th biggest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of around $5 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data. DOT is trading just above $4 at the time of writing, having fallen below the $4 mark for the first time in three years this week as part of a broad sell-off across the altcoin market.

17552736,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=550973,1694559622,"Institutional Investors Flee Ethereum Amid Plunge Toward $1,500","Institution crypto investors have been pulling out of the market for the better part of this year, especially as the bear market has taken hold. However, Ethereum has suffered way more than other assets in this regard with outflows dragging total assets under management (AuM) down. This comes as Ethereum has struggled after falling below the $1,600 support. Institutional Investors Pull Out Of Ethereum In the latest iteration of its Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report, alternative asset manager CoinShares has revealed a growing aversion from institutional investors toward Ethereum. Related Reading: Analysts Are Bullish On ADA But Price Keeps Tanking, What’s Going On? This is characterized by a tremendous amount of outflows spanning months that has caused its asset under management to decline faster than any other crypto asset. The outflow trend also continued into last week as a total of $4.8 million flowed out of Ethereum funds. According to CoinShares, this brings the total year-to-date outflows for the digital asset to $108 million. This figure also represents 1.6% of Ethereum’s total assets under management, the largest percentage of outflows of any asset. This trend points to a waning interest in Ethereum from institutional investors. It is even more glaring given that altcoins such as XRP saw inflows of $0.7 million as investors pulled out of Ethereum. The asset manager put forward that this means that Ethereum is “the least loved digital asset amongst ETP investors this year.” ETH price struggles below $1,600 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com Bitcoin Not Left Out While Ethereum has undoubtedly not been a favorite of institutional investors, it was not the only large cryptocurrency plagued by outflows last week. Bitcoin, once again, saw the largest outflow volumes for the week with $69 million leaving Bitcoin funds. This is in contrast to short Bitcoin which saw a 5-month high weekly inflow of $15 million. Blockchain equities also suffered from another week of outflows totaling $10.8 million this time around. In total, the current run of outflows has seen $294 million leave crypto and blockchain-related funds, accounting for 0.9% of the total assets under management. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Send $486 Million To Coinbase, Time To Exit? This bearish sentiment among institutional investors is also highlighted by the fact that trading volumes saw a massive decline. The asset manager reported that volumes were just $754 million for last week, a 73% drop from the previous week’s figures. Despite last week’s negative sentiment, this week seems to be working out better for the top assets with Bitcoin and Ethereum seeing trading volumes on crypto exchanges jump 96.28% and 41.16%, respectively.

42419615,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUF8Jx,1694559600,Sam Bankman-Fried Remains Stuck in Jail,"Originally, this newsletter was an analysis on whether or not Sam Bankman-Fried would be released from jail ahead of trial. A short while ago, Judge Lewis Kaplan, of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, ruled he wouldn’t be. So this is now just that article, with some added stuff, basically.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Three weeks left  The narrative  Sam Bankman-Fried lost a bid to be released from jail ahead of his trial next month. All hope isn’t lost for him, but time is running out for the FTX founder.  Why it matters  On Tuesday, Judge Lewis Kaplan of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled that Bankman-Fried did not make a particularly persuasive argument that he should be released from jail – where, as a reminder, the judge put him last month on public safety grounds.  Breaking it down  After weeks of back-and-forth on whether or not Bankman-Fried would be released from jail ahead of trial, we have an answer: He won’t be. The judge wrote a brief, fairly dismissive memo citing multiple reasons for his decision, ranging from finding arguments about the amount of time left before trial unpersuasive to saying the defense team didn’t really make a case. The judge left the door open for a new motion that might be more persuasive, but at this point timing may become an issue. A whole month passed between Bankman-Fried's team first trying to get him out of jail and Tuesday's ruling. The trial begins in just three weeks.  My speculative guess is that, at some level, Bankman-Fried’s team didn’t truly expect him to be released. The arguments about the Sixth Amendment seemed more of a rhetorical device. What I think is going to happen is if Bankman-Fried is convicted on one or more of the seven charges he faces at present, his defense team will file an appeal.  In that appeal, I expect they’re going to point to these pretrial motions and argue that he didn’t really have a fair shot at building his defense because of his pretrial incarceration.  This is all speculation though.  What we do know is there are three weeks left until the trial begins. The first step is the final pretrial conference. Judge Kaplan will likely schedule a final conference in the next few weeks where he will lay out how the trial will go, addressing any motions to strike, disclosed witness testimony issues, what rules the prosecutors and defense have to abide by during the trial itself and so on.  Around then, we should start getting a full list of witnesses. There's been some speculation that Ryan Salame, the former co-CEO of FTX Digital Markets, may now testify after pleading guilty to charges last week. Still, the New York Times reports that he is not cooperating in the Bankman-Fried investigation.  That being said, we already know from the DOJ’s past memos that they have written materials from Salame’s phone, which will make an appearance in the trial.  On October 3 itself, we’re going to start with jury selection, otherwise known as voir dire, which is likely to take several days.  CoinDesk will cover each and every day of the trial itself when it begins, with reporting direct from the courtroom.

Odds Split For Next 90 Days","Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency, has defied expectations of a steep decline to sub-$20,000 levels and has rebounded to the $26,000 mark, registering a 3.5% gain over the past 24 hours. This resurgence in Bitcoin’s price coincides with the predictions made by Chartered Financial Analyst Timothy Peterson, whose recent social media post outlined the probabilities of Bitcoin dropping to $22,600 or rallying to $31,200 within the next 90 days. Bitcoin Price Analysis, 8% Chance Of Drop To $22,600 Peterson’s analysis indicates an 8% likelihood of Bitcoin experiencing a downward movement to $22,600, while a 71% chance of the cryptocurrency surging to $31,200. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) Bullish Run Falters: Time To Brace For A Price Dip? According to the chart above, Bitcoin’s price will likely enter a macro consolidation phase over the next 90 days. During this period, the price may fluctuate within the range of its key Moving Averages (MAs). However, the crucial factor for bullish investors is the low probability of a drop below $22,000. This allows them to regain control of the 50-day and 200-day MAs in the short term, currently positioned at $27,200 and $27,000, respectively. The recent recovery of Bitcoin to the $26,000 level has alleviated concerns among market participants who were apprehensive about a potential downward spiral. The cryptocurrency’s ability to bounce back has instilled renewed confidence among investors. Nevertheless, Bitcoin faces a series of resistance levels that could pose challenges. In the immediate term, resistance at $26,454 has temporarily halted the cryptocurrency’s upward momentum. As mentioned earlier, Bitcoin lost its key MAs in August, resulting in additional obstacles on its journey back to $30,000. However, if these resistance levels are surpassed, there remains only one more hurdle before the cryptocurrency can surpass its annual high zone. This final resistance stands at $29,800, which has historically proven to be a formidable barrier whenever Bitcoin has aimed to achieve new highs. Imminent Final Decline Expected? As the market approaches the final weeks of Q3 and edges closer to the new year, QCP Capital, an analysis firm, has been closely monitoring the market using two critical blueprints: the supermoon cycle and the Elliot Wave count. According to their analysis, an imminent final decline is expected to close the quarter at its lows. The chart above illustrates the projected decline, aligning with QCP Capital’s blueprints. The firm believes that the crypto and macro events calendar also supports this view, with a concentration of upcoming bearish events expected to transition to a neutral stance from mid-October onwards. Notable future events include tomorrow’s likely higher-than-expected CPI (Consumer Price Index) data and a more hawkish-than-expected Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting next week. Additionally, asset sales of FTX tokens and the conclusion of the Mt. Gox proceedings over the next month contribute to the bearish sentiment. Although QCP Capital’s theory suggests a potential bottom soon after the supermoon early next month, they anticipate the true bottom to materialize in mid-late October when the negative news cycle has run its course. They expect the market to stabilize during this time and potentially reverse its downward trend. Related Reading: Report Reveals The Stablecoins That Have Suffered The Most De-Peg Events Despite the short-term challenges, QCP Capital remains bullish on the overall outlook.

42419611,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUF8Gr,1694553946,"Fear of FTX-Spurred Crypto Crash Is Overblown, Analysts Say","Crypto investors started the week jittery about an imminent market crash due to FTX shedding its $3.4 billion cryptocurrency holdings, but analysts say those concerns are likely overblown.  “The actual selling pressure could be much smaller than initially anticipated,” said David Lawant, head of research at FalconX.  Digital asset markets declined sharply Monday as traders feared that bankrupt crypto exchange FTX could start selling its crypto stash, which includes $1.16 billion of Solana's SOL and $560 million of bitcoin (BTC). BTC dipped below $25,000 to its lowest price since June, while SOL plunged as much as 8%.  FTX may receive approval for selling assets in its next bankruptcy court hearing scheduled for Wednesday.  Lawant pointed out that part of FTX’s crypto stash is venture investment with lockups that prevent selling the assets, and that there would also be limitations to the asset sales, cushioning the market impact.  “It is likely that the reaction toward the potential FTX sales was overrated and the market calms down from here,” Lawant said.  Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at digital asset investment firm Arca, said that market participants initially overreacted to the potential impact of the sales.  “The way crypto market makers and traders are front-running the FTX supply shows a complete misunderstanding of how a syndicated sale process works,” said Dorman. “This isn’t an every-man-for-himself VC unlock. This is a court-ordered process that Galaxy will sell very slowly and opportunistically,” he added.  The market has rebounded since the initial scare, with BTC returning to $26,000, or roughly the level it was at prior to the Monday sell-off.  More crypto selling pressure on the horizon  While the market impact of any FTX crypto sales might be weaker than expected, there are other events looming that could add to the downward pressure on prices.  “The market also expects further sell-side pressure from Mt. Gox’s trustees and U.S. Silk Road Bitcoins,” Vetle Lune, senior analyst of crypto analytics firm K33 Research, noted in a report.  U.S. authorities are gradually selling off chunks of 50,000 BTC seized last November related to crypto marketplace Silk Road. Victims of the Mt. Gox hack, where some 850,000 bitcoins were stolen years ago but only a fraction have been recovered, might be able to reclaim their assets later this year.  “The schedule and structure of these potential sell-side flows are unknown but have all been decisive forces in hammering an already pressured sentiment,” he wrote.

17548143,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=550974,1694552423,"Tron’s Justin Sun Mulls Over Making A Move On FTX’s Crypto Stash, Here’s Why","In a completely unexpected move, Justin Sun, Founder of Tron and Advisor to Huobi Global has expressed his interest in acquiring FTX’s considerable crypto assets worth billions of dollars. Justin Sun Considers Making A Bid For FTX Crypto Assets Justin Sun, Creator of Tron, one of the world’s largest blockchain ecosystems, has hinted at the possibility of acquiring the assets of insolvent crypto exchange FTX. This statement comes a year after the crypto billionaire was contemplating a majority takeover of Huobi Global. Related Reading: Report Reveals The Stablecoins That Have Suffered The Most De-Peg Events According to data from Messari, a provider of market intelligence products, FTX liquidations hold a total of $1.3 billion in liquid crypto assets excluding stablecoins. The report revealed some of the largest holdings for FTX liquidators which include cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL), Ethereum (ETH), Aptos (APT), Dogecoin (DOGE), Tron (TRX), and Polygon (MATIC). Given the considerable holdings, there have been fears that the market could witness a crash if the exchange were to start dumping its crypto assets. In response to this, Sun revealed in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter) that he was considering the possibility of purchasing FTX holdings. The Tron Founder explained that the reason behind it was to reduce their selling influence on the crypto market. “Contemplating an offer for FTX’s holding tokens and assets to reduce their selling impact on the crypto community. Let’s unite to bolster our crypto ecosystem,” Sun stated. However, data from Messari revealed that FTX and Alameda’s BTC holdings, which are approximately $353 million, account for only 1% of BTC’s weekly trading volume, meaning the crypto market can easily handle selling impacts. Whereas, FTX’s crypto holdings such as DOGE, TRX, and MATIC which range from $20 million to $30 million account for 6-12% of weekly trading volumes, and liquidations could significantly impact the crypto market. Most of FTX’s SOL are also locked up in Alameda and FTX ventures, and they have a unique liquidation pattern, which allows only $9.2 million SOL to be unlocked every month. This monthly liquidation system allows selling impacts of FTX’s Solana holdings to be easily managed. FTT price steadies above $1 | Source: FTTBUSD on Tradingview.com FTX Insolvency Court Case Still Ongoing On November 11, 2022, FTX and a number of its affiliates filed for bankruptcy in Delaware, United States. At the time, the exchange owed a staggering $8 billion after it collapsed due to a liquidity crisis. The crypto exchange is currently under investigation by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) while its Founder and CEO, Sam Bankman Fried was charged on 13 accounts for alleged illegal proceedings he performed in FTX, five of which were later withdrawn in June. Related Reading: Crypto CEO Bags Record Breaking Prison Sentence For $2 Billion Theft FTX liquidators are currently scheduled for a hearing on Wednesday, September 13.

42419604,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUF87Z,1694552315,Judge Denies Sam Bankman-Fried's Bid for Release From Jail Ahead of Trial,"FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried will have to continue preparing his defense from behind bars after a U.S. federal judge refused his motion for a temporary release.  Judge Lewis Kaplan ruled Tuesday that Bankman-Fried was in a situation of his own making in refuting the onetime FTX CEO's multiple motions for a pretrial release. Bankman-Fried was released on bond after his arrest, but the Southern District of New York judge revoked it last month after finding that the defendant had tried to interfere with witnesses on at least two occasions.  Mark Cohen and Christian Everdell, two of Bankman-Fried's attorneys, argued in both written submissions and a virtual hearing that he needed to be able to access discovery materials largely only accessible through online databases and contribute to a shared document detailing his work.  Prosecutors and the defense attorneys have gone back and forth over Bankman-Fried's level of access over the past few weeks, with the Department of Justice arguing that he has access to laptops and hard drives on a daily basis and the internet twice a week. The defense has argued that this level of access is unacceptable and was seriously hampering his effort to work on his defense.  The judge was unconvinced, writing that neither Bankman-Fried nor any other defendant has a right to inspect every piece of discovery that is produced.  ""Defendant is represented by a substantial team of extremely able retained lawyers,"" he wrote.  He was also unconvinced by arguments that Bankman-Fried needs more time per day to work on his defense.  The prosecution and defense both requested a September or October trial date, which the judge granted. While the defense team had a chance to request a postponement of the trial date, which is currently set to begin Oct. 3, no such request was made, the judge added.  ""Whatever time pressure defendant now claims to face given the imminence of the trial date and the claimed limitations of his access to [electronically stored discovery and other material] while incarcerated largely would be of his own making,"" the judge ruled.  The defense can make ""a further application on a more factually grounded and persuasive showing,"" he wrote at the end of his ruling.  The defense team did appeal Judge Kaplan's revocation of Bankman-Fried's bail last month. A three-judge panel from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals will review it, though no hearing has yet been scheduled.

17545939,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=550990,1694548851,Arbitrum Price Sinks To A New All-Time Low – What Is Behind This Decline?,"Arbitrum has managed to maintain its place amongst the top names in decentralized finance (DeFi) despite the unfavorable conditions gripping the space in 2023. However, the price of ARB (the network’s native token), met with a euphoric welcome in March, has been struggling. The Arbitrum token’s price tumbled to a new historical low of $0.747217 on Monday, the 11th of September, with its honeymoon phase seemingly over. The token’s value dipped by more than 12% in the past week, leaving investors wondering what could be behind this bearish movement. Whales Part With Millions Of ARB Token In Selling Spree ARB’s latest price downturn has been associated with the increased market activity of Arbitrum whales in the past few days. On Monday, crypto journalist Colin Wu reported that three whales transferred 10.23 million ARB (worth about $8 million) to Binance. The first whale reportedly sold 3.8 million ARB at $0.77 per token, while the second whale – with the pseudonym vladilena2.eth – sold 3.63 million ARB at $0.83 per token. Meanwhile, the third whale moved 2.8 million ARB for $0.79 per token. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Hits Make-Or-Break Price: 250% Rally Or New All-Time Low? This seeming loss of interest from whales may have precipitated the downward pressure that pushed Arbitrum to a new all-time low. Unfortunately, there appears to be no end, as whales have continued to dump their ARB tokens in the last few hours. According to a Lookonchain report, seven whales have dumped 20.41 million ARB tokens (valued at about $16.05 million) in the last 30 hours. The blockchain analytics platform revealed that these whales generated a total loss of $8.15 million. It is worth noting that general market sentiment may have also contributed to ARB’s price performance. As of this writing, the Arbitrum native token is valued at $0.781039, according to CoinGecko data. Other Possible Reasons For Arbitrum Price Decline Another plausible reason for ARB’s recent price downturn is the dwindling activity on the Arbitrum network. While the chain continues to hold its own as a prominent L2 network, it has been experiencing a steady decline in total value locked (TVL). According to DefiLlama data, Arbitrum has a total value of $1.65 billion in assets locked on its network, reflecting a more than 35% decline in the past four months. This current figure also represents the network’s lowest TVL since March. The sustained decrease in total value locked suggests a loss of investor confidence, which could discourage participants from onboarding the network. Related Reading: Analysts Are Bullish On ADA But Price Keeps Tanking, What’s Going On? Recent governance proposals are another factor that may have contributed to the latest fall in Arbitrum price. Notably, PlutusDAO introduced a proposal on September 9 seeking to return tokens from the DAO treasury to ARB holders. If approved, the governance proposal would involve activating a staking mechanism and the creation of native yield for participants, which could see the annual release of up to 2% of the total token supply. Some investors view this proposal as inflationary, as it would likely exert downward pressure on the price of Arbitrum. Ultimately, ARB’s latest market performance appears to result from a combination of loss of investor interest, dwindling network activity, and unsatisfactory governance mechanisms.

42419603,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUF89d,1694546008,Vitalik Buterin Wants a Better Crypto Mixer,"Vitalik Buterin and friends may have found a genuine solution to blockchain’s privacy-leaking problem. Or at least a new way to build cryptocurrency mixers that maybe won’t get their operators thrown in jail.  In case you didn’t see it last week, there’s a new theoretical paper going around co-written by Buterin that explores a way of combining a few existing technologies like buzzy zero-knowledge proofs and lesser known “Privacy Pools” to build something wonderfully unique.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  In essence, this is both a technological technology and a social technology, a way of joining a crypto washing pool to hide your own blockchain history while also having the right to dissociate from criminals or bad actors who would want to abuse a privacy tool for money laundering.  Of course, not everyone is happy about this happy medium between compliance and privacy. A few cypherpunks worth admiring have found the notion of picking and choosing who to interact with in a smart contract a nonstarter given that digital technologies are meant to level the playing field by treating everyone equitably.  Also, isn’t the idea of “compliant privacy” a bit oxymoronic in the age of the Bank Secrecy Act?  Jacob Illum, a co-author and Chainalysis researcher, appeared on CoinDesk TV on Monday to talk about the research and address some of the controversy. (His co-authors besides Buterin include early Tornado Cash contributor Ameen Soleimani as well as two academics from the University of Basel Fabian Schär and Matthias Nadler.)  “The main idea is how do we achieve some sort of financial privacy on the blockchain,” Illum said.  Blockchains are by default transparent – it’s part of the whole deal. Nodes need to be able to validate transactions and the system can only be “trustless” insofar as everyone can independently verify the same data. This is a revolutionary idea in terms of establishing relationships between counterparties and settling transactions, but presents an obvious problem if the blockchain’s built-in pseudo-anonymity is ever cracked.  And cracked it has been.  It is possible to use Bitcoin or Ethereum today privately, airgapping your alts from your “government name,” but it is insanely difficult and is like taking up a part-time job to do right, making sure you control your own dependencies and on a long-enough timeline you’re either going to slip up or Chainalysis is going to build a tool to break through.  See also: Privacy Isn't Just an Edge Case for Crypto | Opinion  Advancements like Tornado Cash, the now-sanctioned Ethereum-based crypto mixer, allowed for a little more flexibility by giving people the option to disrupt their blockchain histories. Think of Tornado Cash like a big communal washing machine that never stops running – people may see you drop off your dirty socks and pick them up later, but if you leave your clothes in for long enough and there’s enough liquidity everyone will probably lose sight of who owns what (in this example everyone’s socks are the same because all ethers are interchangeable).  But Tornado Cash is totally off limits if you don’t want to risk facing sanctions violations. Not all laundromats are the haunts of bad actors, of course, but at this point all crypto mixers should be assumed to be illegal. Good intentions and civil rights be damned. Blame the Hermit Kingdom.  The “main innovation” the privacy researchers found is something called an association set, which essentially lets a group of trustworthy crypto users run their own crypto mixers. Zero knowledge proofs are layered in to weed out tainted funds and bad actors as well as boosting everyone’s privacy by allowing users to only reveal the information necessary to prove they’re above board.  It’s important to note that although Soleimani is currently working on coding a minimum viable product, it isn’t clear yet whether such a system would work in the real world or even be legal. Illum noted that this could be compliant in some regions and not others, and that he and his co-authors may need to consider adding or removing features.  “I'm a technologist. I'm not a policy maker,” Illum said on CoinDesk TV.  Being able to give yourself a cloak of anonymity sounds like something all crypto people could get behind, but it’s not without controversy. For instance, Zcash co-creator Zooko Wilcox disapproved of the “Guilty Until Proven Innocent” mentality behind a tool that allows people to simultaneously prove their funds are clean while also disassociating from riskier addresses.  Zooko also raised concerns about mixers in general, which “can never provide real privacy for humans” no matter how they’re built because mixers can almost always be compromised simply by observing them for long enough. Ahem, “humans are pattern-generating creatures,” he said. Fair enough.  It’s worth saying that – again, at this low, low, low point in crypto’s lifecycle where we’ve seen the U.S. government sue a computer for failing to register as a money transmitter – there really shouldn’t be complaints against “over-compliance.” Zooko criticized Privacy Pools because they allow people to disassociate from bad actors, even if that isn’t entirely necessary.  See also: When Did Privacy Become a Bad Word? | Opinion  I’m with Ameen Soleimani when he responded saying that choosing to avoid some people is as fundamental a cypherpunkian ideal as being free to associate with whomever. Not all conversations are worth having, silence is a form of expression and while we may live in a society where you’re technically “innocent until proven guilty” doing what you can to stay safe shouldn’t be demeaned. Crypto users are already some of the most loathed individuals on the planet.  The rest of Ameen and Zooko’s debate devolved into an argument over Zcash, with Zooko saying it works and Ameen pointing out even if that’s true no one is using it as intended. Which I think is a roundabout way of getting at the real heart of the issue, anyway, but not in those terms.  Crypto should be private. Privacy and censorship-resistance is just about all crypto is good for, apart from running weird economic and technological experiments. To some extent it doesn’t matter whether crypto is used at all, considering the amount of people “privacy and censorship-resistance” appeals to is a very small niche. And so it’s nice to know something like Zcash exists for those who need it.  But for most people in the world, Ethereum is crypto. And today there’s no way to, say, pay for a meal on-chain without revealing your entire financial history, and that’s a bad thing. At some point Ethereum will need a workable solution for privacy, if only because it’s an expectation everyone already has for “crypto.” Naked blockchains don’t work, and neither do privacy cloaks like Tornado Cash.

17543585,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=550964,1694545217,"Bitcoin Price Imminent Crash Into The $23,000 Level, These Are The Bearish Catalysts","The Bitcoin price has been moving sideways over the past few weeks, although it saw a volatility spike in the last 24 hours. However, the cryptocurrency remains stuck as sentiment turns negative, and more and more traders expect another re-test of critical support. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prints Bearish Technical Pattern, Why It Could Drop To $24K As of this writing, Bitcoin (BTC) trades at $26,200 with a 3% profit in 24 hours. The cryptocurrency recorded a 2% profit the previous week and was the best performer in the crypto top 10 by market capitalization. Why Is The Bitcoin Price Likely To Re-Test Critical Support According to trading desk QCP Capital, the crypto market is about to enter its final quarter with a large option expiration event set for September 29th. These events are often a source of high volatility as major players hedge their positions, roll out contracts for future expiration dates, etc. In addition, the trading desk points to late September as days with a lot of confluence between macroeconomic forces and their Elliot Wave count, signaling bearish price action. The Elliot Wave indicator attempts to provide a price trajectory for an asset by considering market psychology and investor sentiment. QCP Capital believes that Bitcoin is moving and will likely correct into the $23,000 area to complete the trajectory corresponding with a Wave B, per the Elliot Wave theory. The crypto trading desk stated: Based on both blueprints, we expect an imminent final decline to close out the quarter at the lows (Chart below). The crypto and macro events calendar also lines up with this view, with a concentration of upcoming bearish events that only turn neutral from mid-October onwards. This includes a likely higher-than-expected CPI tomorrow and a more-hawkish-than-expected FOMC next week (…) Moreover, other bearish factors coincide with this potential bearish price action, such as the Mt. Gox Bitcoin unlock and the event surrounding the failed crypto exchange FTX. The bearish trajectory, QCP Capital argues, could prolonged into mid-October this year. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Bounces Back To $26,000, Here’s Why If the BTC price completes this trajectory, then the market would have hit bottom, and Bitcoin could begin to recover from a long winter. For late 2023 and 2024, the trading desk is more optimistic: (…) while our theory implies a bottom soon after the supermoon early next month, we think the true bottom will come in mid-late October when the bad news cycle has run its course. We nonetheless remain bullish following that, into year-end and Q1 next year.

17541374,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=550948,1694541607,Analyst Points Out Why End Of 2023 Will Not Be Great For XRP Price,"The XRP price enjoyed a significant rise following Judge Analisa Torres’s ruling in favor of Ripple against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However, a crypto analyst has explained why the token is unlikely to enjoy such a similar trajectory till the year runs out. XRP Price To End 2023 On A Low In a tweet shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Jungle, a prominent figure in the XRP community, stated that he doesn’t “believe the end of 2023 will be great for XRP.” However, it is not only XRP that he believes will end on a low as, according to him, “crypto in general” will not enjoy so much success in the remaining months of this year. Related Reading: Crypto CEO Bags Record-Breaking Prison Sentence For $2 Billion Theft Jungle’s belief stems from the fact that many consumers are currently experiencing financial difficulty, so they might not be looking to invest in cryptocurrencies. He also mentioned the fact that the Federal Reserve keeps hiking interest rates in a bid to keep inflation down. This move ultimately curbs consumer spending, with many only focusing on what they consider necessary. He projects that the financial market will take more hits before the year runs out and states that crypto “will not be immune from the pain.” According to him, now doesn’t feel like a “great time for growth,” further dampening the hopes of anyone who might have had a positive outlook for the crypto market for the remaining months of this year. Jungle’s comment comes at a time when the crypto market is experiencing low trading volume across the board, which suggests that traders aren’t actively participating in the market. One reason could be that they have little or nothing to invest in the market, so they would rather stay out for now. Token price returns to pre-judgment levels | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com Light At The End Of The Tunnel Jungle, however, mentioned that there are positives to look forward to for XRP and the crypto market in general. He noted that Judge Torres’ ruling, alongside a stablecoin on XRPL and an AMM capability, will spark significant growth for the ripple ecosystem. He has also singled out certain factors and events that could drive up the crypto market’s value in the coming year. One of these events is the SEC approving the pending ETF applications by certain traditional financial institutions. An approval from the SEC will see institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity, and ARK Invest onboard a new class of investors to the crypto industry. Related Reading: Remember That Guy That Lost A Flashdrive With 8,000 BTC? Here’s What He’s Up To Now The Bitcoin Halving coming up in the first half of 2024 is another event that Jungle has predicted will help drive up the crypto market’s value. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies’ value is expected to rise significantly once the Halving occurs. Co-founder of Delphi Digital Kevin Kelly had previously noted that Bitcoin’s Halving was a key metric in determining when the next bull run would happen as he noted then that the last two halvings occurred 18 months after BTC bottomed and 7 months before it broke to a new all-time high (ATH).

42419614,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUF8Fp,1694539411,Gensler Hearing Shows Key Senate Democrat Digging in Heels on Crypto,"U.S. crypto legislation will depend on Sen. Sherrod Brown, who amplified his view Tuesday that he sees the industry as jammed with fraudsters and abuse.  Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler – a Wall Street native – characterized the crypto sector as demonstrating the worst behavior he’s ever seen.  While U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler was in the hot seat at a Senate hearing on Tuesday, the most important crypto sentiments may have come from Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who tarred much of the industry as dangerous fraudsters.  “The problems we saw at FTX are everywhere in crypto – the failure to provide real disclosure, the conflicts of interest, the risky bets with customer money that was supposed to be safe,” said Brown, the Senate Banking Committee’s chairman, whose committee will probably have to agree to any crypto legislation to provide the industry a regulatory framework. “FTX was just the biggest and the ugliest.”  Without Brown, a path for a stablecoin bill or a new blueprint for U.S. crypto market oversight is unlikely in the near term, and the Ohio lawmaker praised Gensler’s agency for what the industry has complained is regulation-by-enforcement.  “I’m glad the SEC is using its tools to crack down on abuse and enforce the law,” Brown said.  For his part at the panel’s routine SEC oversight hearing, Gensler reiterated his sharp skepticism of the sector.  “I’ve never seen a field that's so rife with misconduct,” Gensler said. “It’s daunting.”  Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), a reliable ally of the digital assets industry, questioned him about the SEC’s accounting bulletin that advises public companies to keep crypto assets on their balance sheets. The guidance – known as Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 – tells public companies that if they’re handling crypto custody for customers, the assets have to be reflected on the companies’ balance sheets. That could have a major capital implication for banks, Lummis argued, pushing the regulated institutions out of that business.  Gensler said the SEC’s staff made that crypto-specific call because – unlike stocks and bonds – crypto assets aren’t easily segregated. And he said it’s not his agency’s business what the capital treatment is for those crypto assets.  “We don’t speak to how it’s backed,” he said. “That’s up to the bank regulators.”  Gensler’s SEC isn’t entirely ignoring crypto regulation in favor of enforcement actions like those they’ve aimed at Coinbase, Binance and others. His agency has been pursuing a number of rule proposals that would have direct effects on digital assets, though the effect is often about holding existing crypto businesses to current U.S. securities laws.  Congress – including some Democratic lawmakers that have historically been in step with Gensler – has been working on bills to establish specific rules of the road tailored to the industry, which counters Gensler’s view that current laws are sufficient. While two of the bills have cleared the House Financial Services Committee and some senators have proposed other options, Brown hasn’t yet indicated any willingness to take them up.

42419612,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUF8Ht,1694539150,Crypto Price Whipsaw Triggers $256M in Liquidation Losses,"This week’s quick plunge and rebound in cryptocurrency prices has burned traders, triggering $256 million in liquidation losses over the last two days, according to Coinglass data.  The first wave of liquidations occurred on Monday as the market tanked on fears about FTX potentially selling its crypto holdings. Bitcoin (BTC) tumbled from the $26,000 area to below $25,000 for the first time since mid-June and ether (ETH) slumped to its lowest price in six months. Other major cryptos saw 5%-10% declines.  The price action spurred $167 million of liquidations that day, according to Coinglass, with 90% of those being leveraged long positions. It was the largest leverage flush-out in a day since the panicky action on August 17, when bitcoin plunged from around $29,000 to below $25,000 in a manner of hours.  Following Monday’s selloff, traders piled into short positions in anticipation of further declines, but a sudden short squeeze beginning Monday night lifted digital asset prices, propelling bitcoin more than 4% and back above $26,000 by early Tuesday. The advance wiped out another $89 million worth of leveraged positions, this time predominantly shorts.  Large liquidation events often mark a local bottom or top in prices as the swift price swing forces derivatives traders to unwind their directional bets. Liquidations happen when an exchange closes a leveraged position due to partial or total loss of a trader’s initial money down – ""margin"" – as the trader fails to meet the requirement for adding enough funds to keep the position open.  Open interest – the total amount of open options and futures contracts held by market participants – has significantly decreased following past large liquidation events, David Lawant, head of research at institutional exchange FalconX, wrote in a market update. The open interest for BTC and ETH derivatives on major exchanges has dropped roughly 38% from this year’s high and is now near at the levels seen in March, the report noted.  “The strong open interest washout over the past six months suggests that liquidations should play a less pronounced role in spot price action,” Lawant said.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/12/crypto-price-whipsaw-triggers-256m-in-liquidation-losses,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/945af762b1296a754d767485ad99ca7c2e39080d-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Following this, they transferred an additional $328,000 worth of Polygon (MATIC) and BNB (BNB) tokens, as the blockchain security company CertiK reported. Transferred Funds By Hackers Are Estimated At $4.8 Million On September 11, the hacker first transferred 520,000 MATIC tokens, worth over $266,000, which were bridged to the Avalanche blockchain. Some hours later, 300 BNB tokens valued at approximately $61,500 were sent to an externally owned address labeled “0x695…”. Before these recent transfers, the hacker had bridged $4.5 million to different Bitcoin blockchain addresses. This was reported by the blockchain security company Arkham on September 7. The total amount transferred, now at $4.8 million, only constitutes 1.2% of the total $41 million stolen by the hackers. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Hits Make-Or-Break Price: 250% Rally Or New All-Time Low? The Stake hackers exploited the platform by gaining access to the private keys of the platform’s Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum hot wallets. According to the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Lazarus Group from North Korea – known for its involvement in various cybercrimes, including hacking and cryptocurrency-related attacks, might be behind this exploit. The Total Amount Of Money Lost Due To Hacks And Scams Has Exceeded $1 Billion The recent hack of $41 million from Stake has contributed to the cumulative losses from cryptocurrency hacks and scams in 2023. As a result of this incident, the total losses in the cryptocurrency industry have now surpassed the $1 billion mark. Before the Stake attack, CertiK had reported the total losses to be approximately $997 million at the end of August. But for August alone, CertiK reported that exit scams resulted in approximately $26 million in losses. Flash loan attacks accounted for $6.4 million, and exploits caused losses of $13.5 million. The cybersecurity firm verified that these combined losses exceeded $45 million for the past month. However, with several attacks occurring in the past two weeks, the overall figure has now crossed the $1 billion threshold. For instance, a prominent cryptocurrency investor lost $24 million of staked Ether (ETH) in a phishing attack on September 6. Additionally, Vitalik Buterin’s X (formerly Twitter) account was compromised on September 9, and the hacker used it to trick several individuals into participating in a nonfungible token scam, resulting in a total loss of $691,000. Considering these incidents, in addition to CertiK’s previous estimate from August, the total losses due to cryptocurrency-related incidents would now exceed at least $1.04 billion.

42419629,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFBKn,1694537573,Namesake of Ethereum's 'Danksharding' Says 'Data Availability' Too Confusing a Term,"Find the blockchain term “data availability” too confusing?  Don’t worry, so does one top blockchain expert.  Dankrad Feist, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, said Monday during a panel discussion at the Permissionless crypto conference in Austin, Texas, that the industry should consider “data publishing” as an alternative label for the practice.  So-called data availability refers to the idea that blockchains can work faster when the function of storing data is handled separately from the job of processing and confirming transactions. The data can then be independently verified or downloaded when users need it.  The concept of data availability is at the root of several aspiring blockchain projects including Avail and Celestia – and at the heart of discussions on how to scale Ethereum and its ecosystem of sub-networks to handle many more transactions.  Ethereum developers separately are working on their own data-storage solution for the blockchain known as “Danksharding” - named after Feist. According to Feist's LinkedIn page, he has a Ph.D. in theoretical physics and applied mathematics from the University of Cambridge.  “It seems to me that we should rename data availability to data publishing,” Feist said.

17537068,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=551013,1694534951,"BREAKING: Crypto Exchange CoinEX Reportedly Hit By Massive Hack, Losses Exceed $27 Million","In a concerning development, popular crypto exchange CoinEx is believed to have fallen victim to a suspected hack, resulting in significant losses from its Ethereum (ETH), TRON (TRX), and Polygon (MATIC) hot wallets. The incident, which unfolded on Tuesday, has sparked an ongoing investigation into the security breach. Related Reading: Bitcoin Forming Death Cross: Here’s What Happened Last Time Alarming Depletion Of CoinEx ETH Reserves According to reports by Colin Wu, a prominent cryptocurrency journalist, CoinEx reportedly lost a staggering 4,946 ETH and 354,762 TRX as part of the ongoing drain from the exchange’s wallets. The total value of the funds lost surpasses $27.8 million, adding to the growing list of high-profile cryptocurrency exchange breaches. In his latest update, Colin Wu stated: CoinEX is moving the affected hot wallet assets to the cold wallet address 0xf54…7E5d. CoinEX wallets currently hold $97.83 million in assets, of which $89 million are stored in the cold wallet address 0xf54…7E5d, mainly ETH worth $51.7 million and USDT $18.23 million. What’s more, In a concerning revelation, Julio Moreno, the Head of Research at CryptoQuant, has shed light on the peculiar behavior surrounding CoinEx’s Ethereum reserves. The exchange has experienced a staggering depletion of its ETH holdings, with almost 5,000 ETH mysteriously vanishing within a single hour and a total loss of approximately 40,000 ETH since May. As a result, CoinEx’s ETH reserves now stand at virtually zero. CoinEx, however, has remained silent on the matter, refraining from issuing an official statement regarding the suspected hack. The depletion of CoinEx’s ETH reserves indicates a potentially grave situation, as it suggests a significant outflow of funds from the exchange. Such a rapid decline in ETH holdings may have severe implications for CoinEx’s liquidity and ability to meet customer withdrawal demands. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Where Bitcoin Price Will Be By End Of Year CoinEx’s stakeholders and the wider cryptocurrency community will closely watch how the exchange responds to these developments. Complemented by transparent communication, swift and decisive action will be vital in navigating this challenging situation and working towards a resolution.

17536741,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=550924,1694534432,Bitcoin Forming Death Cross: Here’s What Happened Last Time,"Bitcoin appears to be in the process of forming a death cross currently. Here’s what happened to the asset the last time this pattern emerged. Bitcoin 50-Day MA Is Moving Below The 200-Day MA Right Now As pointed out by an analyst in a post on X, the 50-day moving average (MA) has been attempting a cross below the 200-day MA recently. A “Moving Average” is an analytical tool that calculates the average of any given quantity over a specific period of time. As its name suggests, it moves and changes alongside the quantity in question. The main benefit of an MA is that it removes short-term fluctuations from the data, smoothing out the curve. This makes the study of long-term trends easier to perform. MAs can be taken over any length of time, whether that be a minute or a decade. There are some periods that are particularly useful, however, like the 50-day and 200-day MAs, which are of relevance in the current discussion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Adoption: Addresses Saw 2nd-Highest Rise In History This Weekend The interactions between these two Bitcoin MAs have apparently had consequences for the asset’s trend in the past, and the chart below shows how these two MAs have looked recently: Looks like the two metrics have approached each other in recent days | Source: @jimmyvs24 on X Historically, whenever the 50-day MA has dipped below the 200-day MA, the cross has proved to be a bearish one for the cryptocurrency’s price. In the above graph, it’s visible that the last time this type of crossover occurred was in January 2022. Back then, the asset had been on its way down from its November 2021 all-time high and the death cross may have cemented the asset’s fate, as a long bear-market drawdown had followed afterward. The opposite type of crossover, where the short-term MA moves above the long-term one, has generally been a bullish cross instead, as the asset has usually enjoyed uptrends following it. This crossover had been seen earlier in this year as well, after which BTC had gone on to see some significant rise. Recently, however, as the cryptocurrency’s price has been struggling, the 50-day MA has started to go down and has now neared the 200-day MA. If the former continues in this trajectory and completes the cross below the latter, then another death cross would form for Bitcoin. Such a cross would be an ominous sign for the asset, as it could imply that a significant drawdown may be ahead for the coin. So far, though, the bearish cross hasn’t been fully confirmed yet. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Bounces Back To $26,000, Here’s Why It now remains to be seen if the death cross will be completed in the coming days, or if BTC would turn itself around before it happens, leading to the 50-day MA pulling away from the 200-day MA for now.

""Trading volumes on COIN have historically tracked in tandem with changes in the price of bitcoin,"" analysts led by Dan Dolev wrote. “Both peaked in 4Q21, for instance, when COIN volumes reached nearly $550 billion and the average price of bitcoin was greater than $55,000.”  The report said that starting in the first quarter of 2023, there is a “stark bifurcation between COIN volumes and the price of bitcoin.” The exchange’s volumes dropped from $145 billion to $92 billion by the second quarter and are heading towards around $80 billion for the third quarter. In the same period, bitcoin rose to an average price of $28,500.  Mizuho says this indicates potential fatigue among retail customers, and in contrast to previous cycles, fear-of-missing-out no longer “entices investors to trade bitcoin when prices rise,” as it did in prior years. “This could prove problematic for COIN, as it generates around 95% of its transaction revenue from retail trades,” the note said, adding that the year-to-date rise in the shares is unsustainable. “We expect a reality check to follow.”  The investment bank has an underperform rating on Coinbase stock, with a price target of $27. Coinbase shares were trading at $82.49 at the time of publication. The stock has risen about 125% this year, while bitcoin climbed nearly 60%.

42419626,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFBIj,1694531233,Banking Powerhouse HSBC Working With Crypto Custody Firm Fireblocks: Sources,"London-based HSBC, one of the largest banks in the world, is working with cryptocurrency custody technology firm Fireblocks, according to two people familiar with the matter.  Fireblocks specializes in cryptocurrency safekeeping technologies such as multi-party computation (MPC) and, even before this partnership, had experience working with big banks. Back in early 2021, Fireblocks became the custody technology provider of choice for BNY Mellon, and it also works with BNP Paribas.  HSBC didn’t respond to requests for comment by publication time. Fireblocks declined to comment.  The enthusiasm of big banks towards crypto has been dampened by regulatory uncertainty around digital assets. This is particularly thanks to the situation in the U.S., where regulators are fighting with crypto companies in court. This lack of clarity is arguably allowing financial institutions in places like Europe and Asia to win an advantage over their American peers.  HSBC, which holds about $3 trillion in assets, lets customers of its Hong Kong branch trade in bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds.  However, the bank remains somewhat cautious of crypto, at least publicly; back in July, HSBC-owned Hang Seng Bank, also in Hong Kong, said that while licensed crypto companies can open a bank account, they’ll only be able to get a “simple” one.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,ASIA | BTC | ETH | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/09/12/banking-powerhouse-hsbc-working-with-crypto-custody-firm-fireblocks-sources,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6837981a9426336ce3fd248939ded7deb4df806a-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

17534600,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=550934,1694530802,Crypto Analyst Predicts Where Bitcoin Price Will Be By End Of Year,"A crypto analyst has presented their forecast for where they believe the Bitcoin price will be by the end of 2023. However, the end-of-year (EOY) price prediction is not the only interesting thing that the analyst talks about, with short-term expectations also included. Hoops To Jump Through For Bitcoin Price Pseudonymous crypto analyst Titan of Crypto took to X (formerly Twitter) to share their latest prediction for the Bitcoin price. This analysis uses the Ichimoku point of view to analyze a Tenkan Cajun (TK) death cross that appeared on the Bitcoin price chart. Related Reading: Pro-XRP Lawyer John Deaton Reveals The Countries Topping The 75,000 Holder List The importance of this TK death cross is what happened to the digital asset’s price the previous times it has appeared. According to Titan of Crypto, this exact death cross has appeared twice in the past two years, and each time, the outcome has been bearish for the Bitcoin price. BTC falls 20% whenever the TK death cross appears | Source: Titan of Crypto on X As the analyst points out, Bitcoin had dropped an average of 20% when the TK death cross appeared both in June 2021 and January 2022, which does not bode well for the price right now. So another occurrence could see the Bitcoin price fall around 20% from its already low levels. The analyst also points to the packed week in terms of economic announcements such as the CPI and PPI, among others, which could have an adverse effect on the crypto market depending on their outcome. Such a drop as previously recorded could easily see the price drop to $20,300 the analyst points out. BTC price recovers above $26,000 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com BTC Will End The Year On A Good Note Despite the incredibly bearish outlook that has formed for the Bitcoin price, especially in the short term, it is not all gloomy, according to Titan of Crypto’s analysis. For one, the analyst does not expect the price of the digital asset to fall any lower than its already established bottom back in 2022. This means that even though the analyst sees BTC returning toward $20,000, it won’t make a new bottom. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Presents Bull Case For XRP Price To Hit $130, Here’s When Furthermore, the analyst also sees the cryptocurrency finishing out 2023 on a high note. In the same analysis, he points out that he expects Bitcoin to cross $30,000 by year’s end. “Overall I believe that Bitcoin is going to go up and gravitate/pass the $32k level by EOY,” the tweet reads. Going by this forecast, even if Bitcoin does fall to $20,000, the digital asset could see a more than 30% rise before the year is out. “But this scenario hasn’t played out yet and a lot of support needs to break before hoping for such a low price for #BTC,” the analyst explains in a follow-up tweet.

42419635,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFBMr,1694527426,Franklin Templeton Joins Spot Bitcoin ETF Race,"Franklin Templeton filed for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) Tuesday, becoming the latest traditional asset management firm to join the crowded race.  In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Franklin Templeton proposed a Coinbase-custodied ETF that would trade on Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. It has not yet proposed a ticker for the product.  Franklin Templeton follows BlackRock and other financial heavyweights who have bet that the SEC may soon allow – or perhaps even be forced by the courts to allow – a spot bitcoin ETF to hit the public markets. Such a product would give everyday investors an easy means to gain exposure to the price of bitcoin in their brokerage accounts, alongside stocks and bonds.  The San Mateo-based company is already a top name for structured investments products like mutual funds and ETFs, and so its interest in a bitcoin ETF should come as no surprise. But it has never previously filed for one, making this entrance all the more notable.  Even so, Franklin Templeton has come around to digital assets and even toyed with novel funds that blend blockchain technology with a tokenized treasury bond.  While industry analysts are increasingly warming to the notion that a bitcoin ETF could come to the U.S. market, Franklin Templeton's is unlikely to come first. BlackRock, WisdomTree, Fidelity and other prospective issuers are all farther along in the SEC's bureaucratic procedure.  The regulator is next slated to weigh in on those filings in mid-October. But if its past history of bureaucratic delay is any indication, there may not be a final decision until March 2024.

Despite some positive developments in the crypto space, LINK’s price has been on a downward trajectory, failing to capitalize on favorable news. One notable event that failed to provide the expected boost to LINK’s price was the successful completion of Swift’s experimentation with Chainlink. Swift, the interbank messaging giant, had conducted trials involving Chainlink, which created a buzz in the crypto community. However, rather than propelling LINK’s price to new heights, it primarily generated increased social volume and sentiment among traders. Related Reading: Filecoin Uphill Battle To $3.5 – What’s Holding It Back? Chainlink Short-Term Support Zone Crumbles Looking at the price charts in a new analysis, it becomes evident that LINK was unable to maintain a short-term support zone that had been established by bullish investors just last week. The weekend witnessed a decline in prices and a surge in bearish pressure, undermining the previous support. On the 4-hour chart, a bearish order block was clearly visible around the $6.2 zone, marked in red. While Chainlink prices had briefly surged past this level on September 7 and even retested it as support, ultimately flipping it into a bullish breaker block, the bulls struggled to sustain the momentum. The persistent sell pressure over the past few weeks ultimately pushed LINK’s value below the critical $6.2 mark. Bearish Indicators Point To Further Losses As of now, Chainlink is trading at approximately $5.91 according to CoinGecko, marking a 0.6% decline in the last 24 hours and a 1.2% dip over the past week. Both the price action and technical indicators seem to align with the possibility of LINK facing more losses in the near future. Moving forward, the next significant support levels to watch are at $5.7 and $5, as indicated by the higher timeframe price charts. It is increasingly likely that LINK may experience a drop to these levels in the coming days and weeks. LINK market cap currently at $3.2 billion. Chart: TradingView.com LINK Whales Accumulate Amid Bearish Trend Despite the prevailing bearish sentiment, a separate report highlights a noteworthy development. Chainlink whales, holding between 10,000 and 1,000,000 Chainlink tokens, have taken advantage of the recent dip in the asset’s price, anticipating a future recovery in the altcoin’s value. Related Reading: Can Pepe Coin Bounce Back? Insights On Its Future Post-Critical Support Drop Typically, such whale accumulation tends to generate a positive sentiment among traders, as it fuels demand for LINK across various exchanges. However, it remains to be seen whether these bullish catalysts can ultimately break LINK free from its current downward trend, as social metrics continue to outshine price performance in the Chainlink ecosystem.

42419633,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFBPx,1694526132,Building Trust in the Bitcoin Network in El Salvador,"By any measure, the Bitcoin network is still in its infancy. While the concept of digital money is decades old – most dollars today only exist on individual account holder’s computer screens and in centralized ledgers at banks – the idea of holding one’s wealth in self-custody without a third-party validator is new. Bitcoin is the first iteration of triple-entry accounting in the history of capitalism, and the first time that money and state have been separated so people can self-custody their wealth in a digital bearer asset. Many individuals have trouble trusting the system, because they have spent their entire lives transacting within the bank-mediated fiat system.  Jonathan Martin is a graduate of Stanford University, Georgetown University, and a student at The Wharton School, currently on leave immersing himself in the world of Bitcoin in El Salvador.  Here in El Salvador, passionate Bitcoiners are actively working to increase trust in the Bitcoin network among the local populace, through education. I met with a New Yorker named John Dennehy, founder of Mi Primer Bitcoin – My First Bitcoin – a company focused on helping provide curious non-Bitcoiners with their first exposure to the digital commodity.  Dennehy was drawn to Bitcoin for philosophical reasons. He has deeply-held criticisms of the unfairness of the centralized fiat system, based upon a personal experience early on in his career. His view is that the most powerful way to oppose a system is to walk away from it entirely, a concept first posited by the American philosopher Henry David Thoreau.  Read more: Jonathan Martin - The Bitcoin Circular Economy Battles Entrenched Mindsets in El Salvador  Dennehy moved to El Salvador just before the Bitcoin law was passed in September 2021. When he got here just two years ago, adoption was close to zero. In his estimation, the Bitcoin story in El Salvador is just getting started – and Bitcoiners on the ground get to help write it. During our hour-long chat, John emphasized that he is most passionate about decentralization, be that Bitcoin or in other forms, as his goal is to create better economic outcomes for historically marginalized groups. His goal is to address the disease – financial illiteracy – as opposed to the symptoms of financial inequality.  In Dennehy’s mind, Bitcoin is the world’s greatest financial literacy educator. Here in El Salvador, workers are paid every 15 days, and the bars are full that evening. Many of the unbanked Salvadorans spend a large portion of what they earn, because they do not have access to good savings technologies. We are all aware at some level that money loses its purchasing power over time (because of inflation) and we are incentivized to spend it. Once people understand that there is an alternative to fiat that is programmed to be deflationary and that they can self-custody on their smartphones, they become more incentivized to save and plan for the future.  Mi Primer Bitcoin holds monthly events at restaurants around San Salvador, with the goal of “orange pilling” both the restaurant owners and the attendees at the events. Dennehy's collaborators give out free satoshis to encourage attendees to make their first bitcoin transaction when buying food and negotiate with the store owners for slightly lower prices during the event. He shows both business owners and consumers how to use bitcoin. During the event, members of the Mi Primer Bitcoin team walk around to answer any in-depth questions that consumers might have.  Additionally, Mi Primer Bitcoin organizes a 10-week course for people who are curious about learning more about Bitcoin, and they receive a Bitcoin diploma upon graduation. Mi Primer Bitcoin does not mention Bitcoin until about halfway through the program, as the focus is primarily on financial literacy.  Read more: Jonathan Martin - El Salvador Diary: Lightning Is Key to Bitcoin Adoption  In Dennehy’s mind, the road to mass adoption is through the school system. The Ministry of Education has a new initiative with Bitcoin Beach and Mi Primer Bitcoin to implement the core elements of the Bitcoin Diploma more broadly, starting with 50 public school teachers from 25 different schools. The pilot will be implemented in three Departments (States) in El Salvador – Usulutan, La Libertad and Sonsonate – with the goal of going nation-wide by 2024. From there, the program could be implemented across Latin America.  Vertically-integrated bitcoin education  The first Bitcoin block was mined in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous founder of the Bitcoin Network. For the past 14 years, a new block has been added to the blockchain about every ten minutes, regardless of bitcoin’s current market price, news headlines or the current strength of the network’s hash rate.  Tick tock, next block.  The hashrate is the life blood of the Bitcoin Network, and it serves as perhaps the best proxy for adoption. It reflects the total amount of computing power – and, by extension, real-world expenditure of resources to generate electricity – that participants have allocated to securing their wealth contained within the network. The game theoretics are such that anyone who might consider attacking the network by spending billions of dollars to accrue 51% of the network computing power would be incentivized to instead participate in the generation of the next block, as their odds of receiving the next block reward would outpace any competitor. The Bitcoin network is complex and esoteric, and tiered education is central to incorporating more Salvadorans into the nascent Bitcoin economy.  Mi Primer Bitcoin is just the first step. I spoke with a former teacher at CUBO+, a coding academy that provides an technical understanding of Bitcoin to students. He goes by Alex (@AjelexBTC on Twitter) and he is very careful to reveal only certain details about himself. I was able to gather that he is originally from France, although he would not say which city. We chatted twice. I left the conversations mind-blown by his level of thoughtfulness about what to expect with the next Bitcoin bull run and adoption within the country.  Alex explained how there are now four pillars to Bitcoin education in El Salvador, with Mi Primer Bitcoin serving as the most basic. He recently left CUBO+ to create another program called Node Nation, with the goal of installing Lightning nodes in high schools and providing highly technical classes to talented teenagers. From there, students can apply to CUBO+, a six-month long program that is highly selective. Next, students who want to become core developers can apply to Chaincode Labs, the highest tier of education currently available in-country. The curriculum is entirely open-source and decentralized.  The path to mass-adoption in El Salvador might take decades. In the words of Ray Dalio, the Great Reset and rotation to a new global reserve currency will happen slowly, then all at once. That gradual process is evident here on the ground, and, if Bitcoiners are right about the inevitable collapse of the U.S. dollar, Salvadorans will be well-positioned to survive the looming global economic catastrophe.

42419616,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFB9R,1694525690,What's Wrong With PayPal's Stablecoin?,"Thanks to Ripple Labs’s landmark win against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in July 2023, the crypto industry’s general attitude has become noticeably rosier and newly optimistic. Even if the SEC has vowed to appeal the ruling.  So to no one’s surprise, traditional financial (TradFi) institutions suddenly want a piece of the cryptocurrency pie again. Enter PayPal announcing the launch of PYUSD, a proprietary stablecoin backed by the U.S. dollar in early August.  The problem? What was intended to be a milestone in TradFi adoption has landed with a thud amongst crypto natives, and it's not due to some personal vendetta.  Guy Vider is the co-founder and chief technology officer of Kima.  On a line-by-line basis in the smart contract’s code, PYUSD presents a litany of problems and vulnerabilities that clash directly with crypto’s decentralized framework. Without addressing these issues now, PayPal opens up Pandora’s box for other institutions to feel as though the rules of crypto don’t apply to them, giving them a license to remake the industry in their image and bulldoze over a well-established community.  PayPal’s centralized code conundrum  Before diving into PYUSD’s actual code, it’s worth mentioning the token’s purpose: to be purchased only from PayPal, and (currently) sold back only to PayPal. If that sounds familiar, it’s essentially a revamped crypto version of a walled garden or a closed loop of financial activity.  That doesn’t sound too awful, but given PayPal’s history of censorship, unilateral account closures, asset seizures and general lack of transparency, you would be right to question a crypto token controlled by an entity that can swipe your funds for the slightest of reasons.  One caveat to also note is that these opinions are based on the initial PYUSD contract unveiled in early August, and that contract’s code can be changed at any time. For all we know, it is nothing more than a beta.  But immediately when examining PYUSD’s code certain vulnerabilities emerge. Some of these issues are inherent to smart contracts, like freezing and even potentially wiping out account balances if it's exploited. That would undoubtedly undermine trust in the stablecoin and deter adoption.  Speaking of security, we can’t ignore the stablecoin’s blacklist function. To be clear, other leading stablecoins, such as Circle's USDC and Tether's USDT, use a built-in blacklisting mechanism to combat hackers and criminals from accessing them. Using a blacklist is practically an industry standard.  Implementing a blacklist, however, requires either a government order or proof of a hack to lock funds — and they can be unlocked at any time should circumstances change.  PYUSD’s code has a function called “wipeFrozenAddress” that “Wipes the balance of a frozen address, and burns the tokens.” This means the tokens are taken from the user and wiped from the total supply of tokens with no recourse, akin to throwing dollar bills into an incinerator.  PYUSD also has a built-in “pause” functionality, suggesting that PayPal can stop transfers or trades of its tokens universally at any time, potentially causing a massive loss of value. Imagine if the U.S. government could push a button and make all the physical dollar bills in your wallet unusable until further notice, and you only found out when you tried to buy a cup of coffee.  With PYUSD, the discretion of confiscating funds from users remains solely in the hands of a company that has shown time and again it cannot be trusted with such power.  See also: Crypto Means Absolutely Nothing Without Censorship Resistance | Opinion (2022)  Additionally, the code’s “assetProtection” feature threatens crypto’s decentralized perspective, echoing the faults within TradFi that instigated the birth of crypto and decentralized finance (DeFi) to begin with.  This “centralization attack vector"" only further serves to position PYUSD more as a digital version of traditional fiat currency rather than the intended decentralized stablecoin it wants to be.  What does that mean for everyone else?  Code flaws aside, a major financial player like PayPal entering the stablecoin arena does signify a notable shift in the stance of TradFi towards crypto.  Considering PayPal’s influence, it would be unsurprising if other major payment processors, who have already begun dipping their toes in crypto’s waters, take this as a cue to drastically up their pursuit of similar ventures. But they would be ill-advised to simply copy and paste PayPal’s proposition at face value.  In the short term, cryptocurrency exchanges and other projects will likely try to ride PayPal’s outsized reach and user base by listing or adding support for PYUSD. Crypto companies will probably experiment with its capabilities and borrow the sheer name recognition that PayPal brings to divert attention to their own products.  In the long term, however, it is likely that those concerned with preserving decentralization may hesitate to fully embrace PYUSD over more established, regulated, or non-regulated stablecoins due to PayPal’s punitive history and lack of liquidity.  But even if PYUSD is a misfire, the overall changing TradFi sentiments in the wake of PayPal’s stablecoin move signal an increasingly positive future for DeFi and crypto in general.  See also: Reject CBDCs, Embrace the Right to Transact | Opinion  Looking into the features encoded within PayPal’s smart contract spotlights its insistent over-reaching centralized control of users’ finances. Features such as its sole determinations of “misinformation” and subsequent sole discretion to impose financial penalties are equally if not more worrisome.  Likewise, its ability to transfer all funds from user wallets into PayPal leaves many crypto natives hesitant to adopt, viewing it as antithetical to the principles of cryptocurrency, potentially causing hesitation among potential adopters.  Ultimately, PayPal’s foray into the stablecoin market showcases the wrong way to merge paths between TradFi and the crypto sector. If PYUSD is to gain true and lasting traction, PayPal needs to address centralization concerns and ensure its resilience against current and future vulnerabilities.",NEGATIVE,USDT | PYUSD,EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | USDT | PYUSD,Guy Vider,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/09/12/whats-wrong-with-paypals-stablecoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/296f86131c38d31777dbc68c60352ade23ab0d67-2123x1194.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419617,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFB8P,1694524263,"Headline CPI Expected to Have Spiked Higher in August, but Core Rate Seen Slowing","Economists expect the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) to have jumped 0.6% in August, or triple the pace of July's 0.2% increase. On a year-over-year basis, the CPI is anticipated to have grown at rate of 3.6% versus 3.2% in July.  The blame for higher inflation will be laid at resurgent oil prices, with WTI Crude Oil Tuesday morning hitting a new 2023 high just shy of $89 per barrel, up a whopping 33% since the start of July.  The core CPI – which strips out food and energy prices and which seems to garner more attention from policymakers at the U.S. Federal Reserve – is expected to have dipped to a 4.3% year-over-year pace in August from July's 4.7%. That would be the slowest rate of core CPI inflation since mid-2021.  What it means for bitcoin  The summer rally for bitcoin (BTC) and the broader cryptocurrency market has been completely snuffed out, with BTC on Monday dipping below $25,000 to its weakest level since mid-June, and ether (ETH) tumbling to a six-month low.  Analysts will differ on the specific reasons, but surely high on the list are interest rates that give every indication of staying higher and for longer than most had anticipated.  While the Fed appears set to hold its benchmark fed funds rate steady at its policy meeting later this month, investor hopes that the central bank might begin considering cutting rates in the near future have dissipated thanks to continuing strength in the economy and inflation.  Just a couple of months ago, market participants had been anticipating the first Fed rate cuts in late 2023. By a few weeks ago, those expectations shifted to early 2024. A check of fed funds futures traded at the CME now shows bets on the first cut rate having been pushed out to roughly one year from now.  Should it come to pass, tomorrow's decline in core CPI will be welcome to policymakers, but even a 4.3% inflation rate is more than double the Fed's 2% target. And central bankers will have a hard time claiming victory over inflation when consumers are watching prices at the pump advance with each fill-up.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | COMMODITY | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Stephen Alpher,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/12/headline-cpi-expected-to-have-spiked-higher-in-august-but-core-rate-seen-slowing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/368526104f26728e3ceede51fb08d5da5f236db4-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The bear market sentiment right now is why I’m looking to invest.”  The Dunhill brand started out in 1902 selling accessories for the new motorcar craze and soon developed a pipe designed for use while driving. In the years that followed, Alfred Dunhill’s tobacconist enterprise prefigured the modern luxury goods market in its international ambitions.  Dunhill Ventures and the Dunhill Financial subsidiary are placing $3 million to begin with. The money is going into Lichtenstein-regulated VC Mocha Ventures, which is looking to close a 30 million euro ($32 million) fund, and plans to invest in areas like decentralized finance (DeFi) and the adoption of crypto as a payment rail in emerging markets like Africa.  Mocha Venture general partner Renato Brioni pointed out that his firm’s association with Dunhill goes beyond mere check size.  “The Dunhill family office has kindly invited Mocha Ventures into their inner circle of family offices in Singapore, Hong Kong and Dubai, where we will jointly work on closing the fund,” Brioni said in an interview with CoinDesk.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/09/12/dunhill-family-office-makes-bear-market-bet-on-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e48d767724ced6036257921bf1392af4e30e1668-6048x4024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42419622,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFBFd,1694523600,Ethereum Developer Consensys Unveils ‘Snaps’ Add-Ons for MetaMask Wallet,"Consensys, one of the biggest developers for the Ethereum blockchain and the creator of the popular MetaMask crypto wallet, said it's releasing a major new feature called “MetaMask Snaps,” allowing users to choose from a variety of app-like or add-on customizations for their browser extension.  According to the company, Snaps are “new features and functionality, created by third-party developers, that MetaMask users worldwide can install directly into their wallet.”  Previously, MetaMask users could only opt-in to new features built by MetaMask developers, but with this new development, users can now choose from a wider variety outside of the MetaMask landscape.  With the public launch, users will be able to choose from 34 Snaps, each providing various features such as clearer transaction insights, interoperability with non-EVM blockchains, and notifications that keep users informed on decentralized applications in their MetaMask accounts.  For example, Solflare, a crypto wallet provider focused on the Solana blockchain, is launching ""Solana Snaps,"" which will enable MetaMask users to manage their Solana holdings directly from their MetaMask accounts.  ""Because of its different architecture, using Solana traditionally required installing dedicated wallets,"" Solflare shared in a press release.  The snaps will be permissionless, meaning they do not need approval from MetaMask – unlike the way Apple vets its App Store – and developers maintain ownership over the creations and over their code.  “With Snaps, I think what really makes it interesting is that it's something that you couldn't do before with a wallet,” said Christian Montoya, a senior product manager at MetaMask Snaps, to CoinDesk.“ There's just nothing like it.”  Read more: Ethereum Juggernaut MetaMask’s Origin Story Challenged in New Lawsuit  UPDATE (September 13, 14:10 UTC): Adds Montoya's official title.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | SOL | SPONSORED,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/09/12/ethereum-developer-consensys-unveils-snaps-add-ons-for-metamask-browser,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b7c2942749ac72d8185f35b1b0c468bba88b3851-1600x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419628,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFBJl,1694520973,"Incoming BOE Deputy Governor Highlights Crypto Risks, Cites Benefits at Parliamentary Hearing","Incoming deputy governor of the Bank of England Sarah Breeden said crypto does not yet pose much of a risk to financial stability, but could do so in the future.  She also said unbacked crypto has no value, and that events like the collapse of Terra and U.S. banks Silvergate and Signature have shown the risks that crypto poses, Breeden said.  Sarah Breeden, who replaces Jon Cunliffe as deputy governor of financial stability at the Bank of England on Nov. 1, highlighted the risks posed by cryptocurrencies while pointing to the benefits offered by the technology that underpins it at a hearing of Parliament's Treasury Committee on Tuesday.  In her new role, the longtime BOE official will help steer the U.K. as it sets outs its approach for regulating crypto and have a role in the decision on whether to issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC).  ""Crypto is an asset that has no intrinsic value, whose price could go to zero and therefore investors should be prepared to lose all of their money,"" Breeden said. ""That megaphone about the risks in it has been consistent and very clear. However, that technology, I think has got the potential to bring benefits to the financial system.""  Crypto does not pose a big financial stability risk at the moment, she said, but could do so if it were to become more connected to the wider financial world, especially if stablecoins are used for payments. She disagreed with the committee's stance that crypto should be treated like gambling and instead suggested it should be treated as a financial activity.  Recent events have highlighted the risks of the sector, she said. The fall in crypto prices was a ""driver of the failure"" of two U.S. banks (Silvergate and Signature). The collapse of Terra's UST stablecoin as well as several exchanges and lenders ""highlighted how entities in this ecosystem are subject to the same sources of risk as those we have seen in traditional finance,"" she said.  ""Given the global nature of these markets, it is important that regulators work together globally to promote comprehensive and consistent regulatory and supervisory approaches,"" Breeden said in a questionnaire completed before the hearing.  Breeden was supportive of a central bank digital currency, saying she believes one ""would be the anchor for all money in the digital world.""  Ensuring privacy with a digital pound is, however, a concern and regulators will ""need to demonstrate that whatever it is that Parliament has decided is the right boundaries for privacy is the one that we will deliver,"" Breeden said.

42419634,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFBQz,1694520060,First Mover Americas: Altcoin Crash May Be on the Cards,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin (BTC) reversed Monday’s decline to three-month lows under $25,000 during Asian trading hours, jumping back to around $26,000 as open interest on Binance, Bybit, OKX and Deribit fell to $4.8 billion from $5.05 billion. The decline in open interest suggests short traders were abandoning their bearish bets in what’s known as a short squeeze. The price recovery may remain capped due to a lack of immediate bullish catalysts. The bitcoin spot ETF optimism has faded, with observers shifting focus to the impending liquidation of FTX's altcoin holdings.  An altcoin crash is coming, with around $3.4 billion worth of crypto tokens likely to be sold by bankrupt exchange FTX, according to Matrixport. FTX wishes to sell $200 million worth of crypto assets a week in order to return fiat currency to users, which would mean an overhang for altcoins for the remainder of the year. “Crypto venture capital (VC) funds are also under immense pressure to return funds to their investors,” Markus Thielen, Matrixport’s head of research, wrote in a Monday report. “Those VC funds are likely to remain as crucial sellers of altcoins and must cash out.”  Bitget has established a $100 million pot to invest in exchanges, data analytics firms and media organizations as it seeks to broaden its horizons beyond its crypto trading business model. The firm said it expects tightened regulations and growth of layer-2 blockchain networks and DeFi technologies to bring about an evolution in how centralized exchanges operate. It is, therefore, seeking to diversify the services it can offer and capitalize on merger and acquisition opportunities that will be presented in the coming months. The fund, called the EmpowerX Fund, follows just months after Bitget set aside $100 million to target Web3 startups in Asian countries.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows ether's price and Ethereum's revenue since May 2019.  As of today, the token's price appears overvalued relative to Ethereum's dwindling narrative.  ""Fundamentals – as measured by the revenue generated across the Ethereum blockchain – have failed to pick up. This has led to a notable overvaluation of Ether prices relative to underlying fundamentals,"" Matrixport's head of research and strategy Markus Thielen, said in a note to clients on Monday.

42419632,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFBOv,1694520000,"Fabian Vogesteller’s Lukso Blockchain Adds ‘Universal Profiles,’ in Push for ‘Fancy’ Ethereum","Lukso, a layer 1 blockchain for creative types co-founded by blockchain veterans Fabian Vogelsteller and Marjorie Hernandez, is releasing the beta version of “Universal Profiles” – a feature designed to give users a holistic “on-chain identity” that comes with a recoverable crypto wallet as well as a profile for interacting with social media applications.  The Universal Profiles can be used on the blockchain for all sorts of applications (NFTs, decentralized social media, payments), therefore integrating the activity of users under one account that is more than just a wallet address.  Currently, the most common type of blockchain accounts, known as Externally Owned Accounts (EOA), have limited recovery options; if a user loses their private key, their crypto holdings are lost forever. EOA accounts also can’t attach information that could be read by other smart contracts, and transaction fees cannot be paid by other parties as well on an EOA, meaning the user is in charge of providing fees for gas.  Lukso’s Universal Profiles comes with recovery options – employing a smart contract account that can be restored via procedure, or their key manager, if the keys are lost.  In addition, the Universal Profile can read any piece of information, like a photo or a video, which can then be attached to their profile and can be read by other decentralized applications or “dapps” on the blockchain.  The team says that the aim of the project is to give brands an opportunity to bring their identity to the blockchain, a means of making web3 more accessible to the masses.  “We are trying to onboard the 99% of the users that haven't used blockchain yet,” Fabian Volgesteller, co-founder of Lukso and an Ethereum veteran, said in an interview. “Because everybody that's currently using blockchain is a niche that has learned to hop through hoops of difficult steps.”  With Universal Profiles, users won’t have to pay for gas – fees for transactions – on the blockchain. The Foundation for the New Creative Economies, the body behind Lukso, is allocating a certain amount of LYX for gas usage for users, and setting up a marketplace for relay providers so that users can subscribe and choose which relay to use to pay for their gas (sort of like choosing a mobile plan.)  “We want to have a lot of competing transaction relay services that have their own business model, and that compete for users because then we can pull ourselves out of the picture,” Vogelsteller told CoinDesk.  Lukso’s mainnet went live in May. Since then, nearly 57,000 validators are running the network  Vogelsteller boldly claims that eventually, “Lukso will be bigger than Ethereum,” but for now he positions it as just an improved version with more user-friendly features.  “It’s Ethereum, just fancy, and it's Ethereum in its essence,” he said. “But what Ethereum is missing is the easy-in, the usability, the normie kind of capacity.”  Read more: Inventor of Ethereum’s ERC-20 Token Standard Plans New Blockchain ‘LUKSO’ for Creative Types  UPDATE (September 12, 13:43 UTC): Updates number of validators running the network.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/09/12/fabian-vogestellers-lukso-blockchain-adds-universal-profiles-in-push-for-fancy-ethereum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/85826bff751d02e8f069086f8608a50c28978729-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, analysts have revealed several stablecoins that have been struggling to maintain the esteemed stability reserved for these types of assets. Stablecoins Under Pressure The inherent volatility of the crypto market and the persistent price fluctuations of cryptocurrencies are a constant experience in the crypto industry. Due to this, stablecoins like USDT, USDC, and DAI have long been revered as a reliable bridge between the volatility and instability of cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Crypto CEO Bags Record-Breaking Prison Sentence For $2 Billion Theft However, a recent report has raised concerns about the stability of some of the most popular stablecoins. The report saw analysts from S&P Global explore the top five stablecoins including Tether (USDT), Dai (DAI) Binance USD (BUSD), USD Coin (USDC), and Paxos (USDP). The research paper from Dr. Cristina Polizy, Anoop Garg, and Miguel de la Mata revealed that USDC and DAI have failed to maintain their dollar peg multiple times in the last two years, as compared to other stablecoins like USDT and BUSD. The analysis revealed that the de-pegging events for USDC and DAI have taken place more often than those of USDT and BUSD. Circle’s USDC was named as the stablecoin with the most prolonged de-pegging event, dropping to $0.90 for 23 minutes while DAI de-pegged for 20 minutes. USDC de-depegged for the longest duration | Source: S&P Global In contrast, USDT dropped below the one-dollar peg for just one minute, while BUSD has not experienced any de-pegging event since June 2021 and June 2023. Possible Instigations For Stablecoin De-pegging Events March 2023 saw the fall of three prominent banks in the United States, including Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), Silvergate Bank, and Signature Bank. Due to the affiliations of these banks with the crypto industry, their collapse had a significant impact on the prices of digital assets in the space. Circle’s USDC experienced a decline of 13% below the one-dollar mark after reports revealed that a significant portion of Circle’s cash reserves, adding up to $3.3 billion, were kept in Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). However, the stablecoin has since recovered and maintained its peg following an announcement that confirmed that the Federal Reserve would endorse the banks’ creditors. Related Reading: Remember That Guy That Lost A Flashdrive With 8,000 BTC? Here’s What He’s Up To Now Subsequently, Michael Barr, a high-ranking official at the United States Federal Reserve raised concerns about the adoption rate of unregulated stablecoins like USDT and USDC, which are currently the top stablecoins by market capitalization. As the broader crypto market watches closely for more discrepancies in the stablecoin dollar peg, financial firms like PayPal, have launched their own stablecoins. Prominent platforms like Binance, and Huobi are already incorporating the new PYUSD into their crypto portfolio. In addition, monetary institutions like Visa are taking advantage of stablecoins like USDC to propel expansion into new markets.

The curtailment strategy is possibly helping the company's bottom line at the cost of public opinion. Mining economics remain poor, and Riot Platforms needs a much higher BTC price to operate at breakeven. However, if you're bullish on BTC, RIOT will likely be an outperformer to the upside as it was in the first half of 2023. Since my last article covering Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), we have quite a bit of new data to assess. While I am bullish on Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) long term and by extension a handful of Bitcoin proxies like Riot Platforms, I was more cautious in my last Seeking Alpha piece covering Riot due to poor mining economics and a recent surge in share price that I didn't want to chase. After a 40% selloff since that article, the time might be right to look at two months of fresh production data, the company's second quarter earnings performance, and the Texas energy crisis where Riot Platforms now finds itself to be a defendant via the court of public opinion. Q2 Earnings For the 3 months ended June, Riot Platforms generated $76.7 million in revenue against $64 million in cost of revenue and $91.6 million in total operating expenses. This resulted in an operating loss of $78.9 million. Q3-22 Q4-22 Q1-23 Q2-23 TTM Cost of Revenues $42,700,000 $57,000,000 $63,100,000 $64,000,000 $226,800,000 Total Opex $48,500,000 $91,800,000 $76,500,000 $91,600,000 $308,400,000 BTC Mined 1,047 1,689 2,110 1,775 6,621 Breakeven Price $87,106 $88,099 $66,161 $87,662 $80,834 Source: Riot Platforms, Analyst's calculations Given the 1,775 BTC that were mined in the quarter, I'm calculating the company's breakeven price at close to $88k when adding cost of revenue and total opex. However, when adjusting for the income from interest and investments, realized gains from BTC sales, and power curtailment credits, Riot's quarterly net loss was down to just $27.7 million in Q2-23: Data by YCharts From a total performance perspective, Q2-23 was Riot's best quarter since Q1-22 when Bitcoin was trading between $35-45k. The company's power credits strategy is something that has become more meaningful in recent months. July and August Production Over the last several months, we've seen a notable decline in the amount of BTC that Riot has been mining. After averaging 681 BTC between December and May, Riot's BTC production has continued to decline sequentially from June through August: RIOT Monthly Performance (Riot Platforms, Analyst's Chart) August's 333 BTC mined was the lowest number for Riot since July 2022 even as EH/s capacity has grown from under 5 to nearly 11. Of course, these recent declines in monthly production have been largely by choice. In my late-July article, I mentioned the record heat in Texas, where Riot operates. That heat didn't dissipate in August. The temperatures actually got so bad last month, that Riot had its largest combined month ever from the power credit and demand response categories at roughly $31.7 million. The company did so well selling back energy in August, that Bitcoin mining only accounted for 21.4% of Riot's performance in August: (millions) BTC Mining Power Credits DR Credits % From Mining May 2023 $16.5 $0.5 $2.3 85.5% June 2023 $10.6 $8.4 $1.6 51.2% July 2023 $12.1 $6.0 $1.8 60.8% August 2023 $8.6 $24.2 $7.4 21.4% Source: Riot Platforms From a BTC-equivalent standpoint, Riot's power/DR credit haul in August was comparable to mining an additional 1,136 Bitcoin. This, again, is arguably one of the clearest indicators we have of how bad the current mining economics are for Riot and its peers. August Performance BTC Equivalent Revenue/Credits Per BTC Mined BTC Sales 300 $8,600,000 $28,667 Power/Demand Response 1,136 $34,700,000 $30,546 Source: Riot Platforms, Analyst calculation At $8.6 million in revenue from selling 300 BTC at an average of $28.7k, selling the energy back for $34.7 million instead was comparable to mining BTC at a nearly $2,000 premium. This is theoretically bad for Bitcoin because it disincentives network validation by one of the largest miners in the industry. But beyond the interesting economics of Riot's system, Riot's power credits are also creating potential issues philosophically with the broader public. Power Credit Controversy? Right or wrong, Riot's ability to benefit from curtailment has become a bit of a lightning rod in the court of public opinion. Shortly after Riot's August production update, CNBC published an article that led to a nearly immediate response from the company: In particular, on September 6, 2023, CNBC published a story titled Texas paid bitcoin miner Riot $31.7 million to shut down during heat wave in August . Unfortunately, this sensational and inaccurate headline has caused confusion, which we would like to dispel. In August, Riot provided over 84,000 megawatt hours of energy to the market in Texas to reduce overall demand, lower consumer prices, and stabilize the grid during a heat wave. This ensured that consumers did not experience disruptions during extreme temperatures. In scanning some of the comments from Twitter/X and even from articles here on Seeking Alpha , one of the main critiques appears to be that companies like Riot are ""hoarding"" energy for what many view to be a wasteful activity. While this is by no means a new or unique criticism of Bitcoin mining, I think it is worth noting that there may still be political risk for public miners if there is a larger push to ban proof-of-work crypto mining in various jurisdictions. In my personal view, it's less likely that a proof of work ban would come in a place like Texas, but these are things mining company investors should be considering nonetheless. The Coming Halving The larger issue though may still be the poor economics of simply using the energy to mine Bitcoin. Bitcoin mining continues to be near all-time lows, and the ability to profitably mine BTC is only going to get worse in the not-too-distant future: BitInfoCharts We're roughly 7 months from the next Bitcoin halving. The result of which will be a 50% reduction in the block reward from mining newly issued Bitcoin. Following that event, the mining space will see revenue trimmed in half overnight if the price of BTC and/or the transaction fee market remains at their current levels. Investor Takeaways My fundamental view on RIOT is unchanged. When I covered the company in late July, I said I was not buying the rip. Now that the shares are 40% lower from where they were when that article was published, you could talk me into getting slightly more aggressive with a DCA strategy. I think anything under $10 is probably a reasonable starting point if you're looking to build a RIOT position. Though there are obvious risks with this company; notably poor mining economics, high breakeven price, and the propensity to dilute shareholders, Riot still has one of the biggest HODL stacks in the business and a large capacity for production if the price of BTC justifies keeping the machines on. If BTC goes up considerably from here, RIOT will likely outperform many of its peers as it did from January through July 2023 with Bitcoin was rebounding.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4634553-riot-platforms-the-heat-is-on?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/17525413.jpeg

On the other, a descending triangle, which has been in the making for over 13 months, hints at a bearish outcome. In an analysis on August 30, NewsBTC already warned of this scenario. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Community Sounds Warning Alarm As Scammers Siege Shibarium Yesterday, SHIB’s price dipped to a low of $0.00000697 before rebounding slightly to $0.00000722. This places it precariously above the crucial support line of $0.00000715. For SHIB to steer clear of the bearish implications of the descending triangle and to validate the triple bottom, it’s imperative that it maintains a weekly close above this price. The triple bottom, a bullish chart pattern, is characterized by three roughly equivalent lows bouncing off a support level, culminating in a breakout above resistance. This suggests a shift in momentum from sellers to buyers. For SHIB, the criteria for a triple bottom seem to be in place: an existing downward trend precedes the pattern; the three lows are approximately equal, allowing for a horizontal trend line and a decline in volume throughout the pattern suggests weakening bearish momentum. SHIB’s journey through this pattern began in June 2022 with its first low at $0.00000715. After a brief recovery, it hit its second low in December 2021 at $0.00000781. The third and most recent low was recorded in June 2023 at $0.0000060. The Shadow Of The Descending Triangle However, the triple bottom’s bullish narrative is challenged by the descending triangle’s bearish undertones. If SHIB’s price falls below the $0.00000715 support, it could validate the descending triangle, potentially pushing SHIB towards its year-to-date low of $0.000006. A breach of this level might plunge SHIB into uncharted waters, making a new all-time low a grim possibility.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is one such tool. SHIB’s weekly RSI currently stands at a neutral 39.8 (neutral). However, a recent dip below the 30-mark (indicating oversold conditions) suggests that the recent price drop might have been the last for SHIB. Should the triple bottom be validated, SHIB could witness a significant rally. An immediate target to watch would be the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.00002545, translating to a potential surge of approximately 250% from its current price. In conclusion, SHIB’s future hangs in the balance. The coming days and weeks will be crucial in determining whether it embarks on a bullish rally or succumbs to bearish pressures.

42419631,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFBNt,1694513612,Bitcoin Price-Volatility Correlation Turns Negative Again as Crypto Traders Eye FTX Liquidations,"The correlation between bitcoin and its implied volatility has turned negative again, indicating investor concerns about moves to the downside.  Investors seem worried that impending FTX liquidations and continued monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve will drive crypto prices lower, according to one analyst.  Bitcoin's (BTC) price and the cryptocurrency's forward-looking 30-day implied volatility gauge are again moving in the opposite direction. The return to a negative correlation represents concerns about looming FTX liquidations, according to observers.  The 60-day trailing correlation between bitcoin's price and implied volatility flipped negative a week ago and fell to -0.29 early Tuesday, according to Velo Data.  Bitcoin's price has declined by almost 10% in four weeks. The price hit a three-month low below $25,000 on Monday as traders took account of the possibility that defunct crypto exchange FTX will secure bankruptcy court approval to start selling its $3.4 billion worth of crypto holdings. Leading crypto options exchange Deribit's BTC DVOL index, which measures the 30-day implied volatility, has increased to 42 from 32 in the past four weeks.  A decrease in price alongside an increase in implied volatility indicates bias for put options, derivative contracts offering protection against price slides. Implied volatility refers to investors' expectations for price turbulence over a specific period and is influenced by demand for both call and put options. That means the negative correlation stems from expectations of and positioning for a potential FTX-induced aversion to risk.  ""The market has spent the last few months preparing for a potential ETF approval and has thus been very concerned about asymmetric moves to the topside."" Jeff Anderson, a senior trader at STS Digital, told CoinDesk. ""That sentiment has shifted recently with the FTX liquidation news and fears that the bottom could fall out of the spot price. As such, the implied volatility has gone bid with spot prices moving in an area of perceived weakness.""  Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader from crypto asset management firm Blofin, said concerns of additional monetary tightening in global markets are also behind the shift in the volatility trend.  ""The impending U.S. August CPI data will likely show a rebound in inflation, which means the Federal Reserve (Fed) will probably take additional liquidity-tightening measures to curb reflation. In liquidity redistribution, crypto assets are prioritized last, which means that the liquidity stored in crypto assets could be withdrawn and invested in assets such as cash or U.S. stocks,"" Ardern said.  ""That has pushed up investors' preference for puts, bringing a negative correlation between prices and volatility,"" Ardern added.  According to RBC Economics, the CPI report due Wednesday is expected to show the cost of living in the U.S. ticked higher to 3.6% year-over-year in August, up from 3.2% in July. Several leading indicators have warned of an inflation rebound in the coming months. That's likely to keep the Fed from cutting interest rates and injecting liquidity into the market anytime soon.  The year has been characterized by consistent positive market value-volatility correlation, barring the latest negative flip and the one seen in May.  The positive correlation meant price rallies rewarded BTC call option holders with directional gains as well as volatility gains. With the return of negative correlation, put holders stand to make outsized money during potential price drops relative to what calls would earn during price rallies. That's usually the case in the equity markets.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/12/bitcoin-price-volatility-correlation-turns-negative-again-as-crypto-traders-eye-ftx-liquidations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7d6399aeefabf6a696b45e3ba380bf4faef5c417-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419636,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFBS1,1694513503,"One Year After Trudeau's Bitcoin Warning, BTC Still Beat Inflation and S&P 500","Since Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said political rival Pierre Poilievre's call for Canadians to buy bitcoin was irresponsible, the digital asset is up 15%, beating inflation and the S&P 500.  Despite Trudeau's hostility towards crypto, several Liberal Members of Parliament own digital assets.  One year ago, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned that opposition leader Pierre Poilievre’s suggestion that Canadians invest in bitcoin (BTC) to beat inflation was “not responsible leadership.”  However, despite the market-shaking events that occurred in the months after Trudeau’s warning, which kicked off a deep crypto winter, it turns out that Poilievre’s advice was sound.  During the past calendar year, bitcoin is up approximately 15% while inflation came in at 6.5%, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Statistics Canada reports the nation’s inflation rate was slightly higher, with the nation’s CPI up 6.8% annually.  ""Telling people they can opt out of inflation by investing in cryptocurrencies is not responsible leadership,"" Trudeau tweeted last September in response to a comment from Poilievre that “Canadians should have the freedom to use other money, such as bitcoin.""  Bitcoin also outperformed the S&P 500, a broad index of the biggest listed companies in the U.S.  The CoinDesk Currency Select Index (CCYS) and the CoinDesk Currency Index (CCY) from CoinDesk Indicies would have also netted positive after inflation, with CCYS up 14.8% on-year and CCY up 13% on-year. Bitcoin makes up the majority of the weighting of CCYS, while CCY has a broad selection of large-cap digital assets.  However, there are plenty of tokens that are significantly down over the same time horizon. Metaverse tokens, such as Decentraland’s MANA, and Axie Infinity’s AXS plunged 65% and 70%, respectively. Meanwhile, Binance-linked BNB is down 30% and ether (ETH) has slumped 8%.  Bi-Partisan HODLers  During a March 2022 campaign stop, Poilievre bought a Shawarma with bitcoin, and a disclosure from May of that year shows that he owns shares of the Purpose Bitcoin ETF (BTCC).  Poilievre is one of the half-dozen bi-partisan Canadian Members of Parliament and civil servants who had at one time some form of digital asset holdings, according to the Office of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner.  Despite Trudeau’s advice, according to disclosures, digital asset ownership is split evenly between the Liberal and Conservative Parties.  Liberal MP Chandrakanth ""Chandra"" Arya, who represents the riding of Nepean in Ontario, owned in 2021 bitcoin, ether, and units of 3iQ’s bitcoin fund as well as ether fund.  Joël Lightbound, who represents the Quebec riding of Louis-Hébert for the Liberal Party, owns shares of Purpose’s bitcoin and ether ETFs as well as bitcoin and Solana tokens. He also notes that he has a “loan receivable from an individual” under the cryptocurrency section in his disclosure.  Vancouver MP Taleeb Farouk Noormohamed disclosed that he owns bitcoin, ether, and stacks (STX). Stacks, the native token of Stacks Network, is a bitcoin layer-2 that helps extend the Bitcoin network’s functionality to be better equipped for Ordinals, which are similar to non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  During the 2021 election, Noormohamed was criticized for being a fervent real estate speculator and flipping 42 homes within the Metro Vancouver area during the last 17 years despite Trudeau’s campaign platform, which describes the practice as “predatory.”",POSITIVE,AXS | BTC | MANA | BNB,AXS | BTC | MANA | MARKET | BNB,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/12/one-year-after-trudeaus-bitcoin-warning-btc-still-beat-inflation-and-sp-500,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d56c5fb8729f52fe29cd50dc6cd0c87df4bb667-2837x1879.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Insights On Its Future Post-Critical Support Drop,"Pepe Coin has been on a wild ride in early September, characterized by significant price volatility and a troubling dip in its performance. The price action of PEPE early this month followed a bearish pennant pattern, marked by two converging trendlines. This pattern typically signals indecision in the market, as buyers and sellers wrestle for control. However, the situation took a turn for the worse as the coin broke below its support trendline, increasing the pressure on the supply side. As of the latest data from CoinGecko, the coin is trading at $0.00000067, showing a 3.9% loss in the past 24 hours and a substantial 14.4% decline over the past week. Most notably, PEPE has tumbled out of the coveted crypto top 100 list on CoinGecko. Related Reading: Filecoin Uphill Battle To $3.5 – What’s Holding It Back? PEPE Selling Pressure Intensifies On September 10, PEPE suffered a bearish breakdown as it breached the support trendline. This development, coupled with a rising supply pressure across the altcoin landscape, resulted in a sharp decline in the value of PEPE. Investors and enthusiasts began to question the coin’s future as it struggled to maintain its position. Source: Coingape Adding to the concerns surrounding PEPE, a tweet from Lookonchain on September 11 drew attention to a peculiar event. Several investors opted to sell their PEPE holdings, swapping them for PNDC (Pandacoin). Three wallets collectively sold a staggering 1.38 trillion PEPE tokens for 600 ETH, equivalent to approximately $965,000. In a surprising twist, they reinvested 600 ETH to purchase 487 billion PNDC tokens. We noticed that 3 wallets changed their $PEPE positions to $PNDC today. They sold a total of 1.38T $PEPE for 600 $ETH($965K) and spent 600 $ETH to buy 487B $PNDC.

Buying pressure on the meme-inspired coin remained high, which, paradoxically, contributed to the bearish sentiment. Notably, PEPE’s supply on exchanges experienced a sharp increase over the past few days, indicating a surge in selling activity. PEPEUSD currently trading at $0.000001 on the daily chart: TradingView.com What Lies Ahead For Pepe Coin? This shift occurred simultaneously with a decrease in PEPE’s supply outside of exchanges, further highlighting the rising selling pressure. Moreover, PEPE’s exchange inflow witnessed a noticeable spike, while the total number of holders declined, painting a gloomy picture for the cryptocurrency.

The stablecoin integration also removes the headache of meeting gas fees by allowing USDC to be the ultimate gas fee token on any blockchain, Qredo said on Tuesday.  Seamless connection to USDC, the second largest of the USD-pegged stablecoins, is lifeblood to decentralized applications and protocols, and making gas fees on chains like Ethereum more intuitive is a problem Visa (V) recently tackled.  Qredo’s new toolkit comprises a number of elements, including Circle’s APIs and “cross-chain transfer protocol” to do minting, redeeming, and transacting with USDC across multiple networks. This is combined with software from Etherspot, a specialist in making web3 transactions frictionless, and Qredo’s open source payment rails, dubbed QSign.  ""This close integration with Circle’s USDC APIs allows institutions to bring millions of dollars in a single swipe into crypto and into USDC, and have those assets reside in their Qredo non-custodial wallet,” said Ben Whitby, Qredo’s head of strategic partnerships in an interview with CoinDesk. “It’s literally from fiat to non-custodial in one step.”  A “gasless” transaction experience not only helps users engage with blockchains, it also provides certainty and predictability when it comes gas costs, Whitby said. “This is really a dream come true for CFOs.

Sela feeds into digital currency projects for Israeli shekel, Hong Kong dollar.  Central bank digital currencies can be set up to be secure and private while allowing transactions to be settled on the central bank’s own ledger, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has said as it outlines the results of its Project Sela.  Central banks across the world are looking at whether they can issue digital versions of their fiat currency, and Sela in particular is probing how those systems can be protected from hacks and distributed to people.  “If central bank money is to go digital, cybersecurity is key,” Andrew Abir, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Israel, which is examining whether to issue a digital shekel, said in a statement. “The project proved the feasibility of the model we had in mind.”  In project Sela, transactions were settled directly on the central bank’s balance sheet, but BIS said that privacy was preserved because people’s personal identifiers were “obfuscated.”  While many CBDCs, such as the European Union’s proposed digital euro, would use banks and other payment providers to link between central banks and ordinary users, Project Sela uses what it calls a “novel type of intermediary” to handle customer-facing services without the liquidity risk of holding funds directly.  Previous BIS research has indicated 93% of central banks across the world are examining whether to issue CBDCs. That has raised concerns over citizens’ privacy – not least given fears that China will use its digital yuan as a form of social control.

42419625,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFBGf,1694507105,Cryptocurrency Altcoin Crash Is Coming: Matrixport,"At least $3.4 billion worth of crypto is likely to be sold by FTX so it can return fiat currency to its users instead of tokens, which should create an overhang for altcoins for the rest of the year, Matrixport said in a report Monday.  The crypto services provider noted that FTX has said it wanted to sell $200 million worth of crypto assets a week. This means the bankrupt crypto exchange will continue to sell assets until the end of 2023.  Moreover, FTX isn’t the only major seller in the market. “Crypto venture capital (VC) funds are also under immense pressure to return funds to their investors,” wrote Markus Thielen, head of research. “Those VC funds are likely to remain as crucial sellers of altcoins and must cash out.”  Solana (SOL) has been dropping, spooked by the potential sales from FTX, and it’s not the only altcoin that is exposed.  There is also ApeCoin (APE), another crypto held by VC investors, which has an unlock scheduled for Sept. 17. That will account for 11% of outstanding tokens, the report said. Following the previous unlock of 4.2% APE on Aug. 17, prices have dropped by 24%. Since this one is larger, prices are expected to continue to decline.  Another sizable unlock planned for Oct. 20, is Axie Infinity’s token (AXS), when 11% will be released. Since the last such event, on July 22, AXS has declined by 32%, the report added.

17520778,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=550872,1694505615,"Bitcoin Price Bounces Back To $26,000, Here’s Why","In a swift turnaround from yesterday’s dip, Bitcoin (BTC) surged to nearly $26,000 during Asian trading hours on Tuesday. This recovery, which saw the BTC climb from $25,210 to $25,973 in a mere 30 minutes (from 3:00 am to 3:30 am UTC), was not driven by any specific news event. Instead, the dynamics within the Bitcoin futures market played a pivotal role. Why Has The Bitcoin Price Bounced Upwards? Renowned analyst Skew provided a technical perspective on the price movement, referring to it as a “textbook short squeeze.” Delving deeper into Skew’s analysis, he pointed out a clear divergence in the Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) of perpetual contracts (or “perps”) with the actual price. In trading, a divergence between CVD and price can signal a potential reversal. In this context, while sellers were trying to push the price below $25,000, the CVD indicated that buying pressure was mounting. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly TD Sequential Buy Setup Appears, But Warns Of Potential Risk Furthermore, the futures market had a high number of short positions relative to the open interest (OI), and the funding rate was negative. A negative funding rate typically means that shorts are paying longs, indicating a bearish sentiment. Despite attempts to drive the price down, Bitcoin was reclaiming its swing long price level at $25,300 and failed to maintain the bearish trend in the lower time frame (LTF). The spot market, where assets are bought and sold for immediate delivery, was showing signs of a bullish structure change, with prices gradually moving higher. Skew suggested that the culmination of these factors led to a short squeeze, where those who bet against the market (short sellers) are forced to buy back into the market to cover their positions, further driving up the price. Skew’s analysis essentially highlights that while there was a bearish sentiment with many traders betting against Bitcoin, underlying indicators were hinting at a potential bullish reversal. For traders, the immediate goal post-squeeze is to reclaim $26,000. TheKingfisher offered a more succinct take, hinting at the short squeeze and its impact on those who were betting against Bitcoin: “See you around high lev shorters. BTC Cleared them again.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Confirms Double Top, How Low Can BTC Drop? Axel Adler Jr. shed light on the broader market sentiment, noting, “Traders do not plan to go any lower. Net Taker Volume has risen by 9.79%. Over the past year, this is a new record for the balance of open Taker orders with long positions.” Despite the rapid price movement, the short squeeze’s magnitude was relatively modest. Coinglass data reveals that about $12.32 million in BTC shorts were liquidated. For context, the most significant short liquidation event in the last three months occurred on August 17, amounting to $120 million, when BTC briefly dipped to $24,700 before making a quick recovery above $26,600. The decline in open interest in futures on the major exchanges was also rather small. According to Coinglass, open interest fell from $10.66 billion to $10.65 billion. This slight decline suggests that few traders had to close their bets, with funding rates turning positive, signaling a shift from bearish to bullish sentiment. At press time, BTC stood at $25,768.

Having attained license approvals from German financial regulator BaFin earlier this year, the custody provider is offering its 300-plus institutional clients FinoaConnect, a wallet integration with a curated list of permissioned DeFi platforms, web3 applications and blockchain governance scenarios, the firm said on Tuesday.  Regulated institutions can get involved with DeFi lending pools and automated market making, but they have to know who they are trading with. This has seen a more buttoned up breed of DeFi emerge with added anti-money laundering (AML) measures such as built-in digital identity, or whitelisting of lending counterparties.  In recent months, Finoa has received a good deal of inbound demand to enable decentralized apps in web 3 apps in its custodial wallets, Finoa founder Henrik Gebbing said in an interview with CoinDesk.  Having looked at various off-the-shelf wallet offerings, Gebbing felt these didn’t reflect the security and transaction integrity of Finoa’s custodial wallet infrastructure, built up over the past five years. In the end it made sense to build FinoaConnect on top of the existing proprietary tech, he said.  “An important differentiator is what we as a regulated custodian can and cannot do,” Gebbing said. “What you will not find, for example, is that we just connect Finoa wallets to any kind of decentralized app out there, permissionless DeFi and whatnot. It’s really a filtered, curated set of d'apps that you can work with.”  Finoa did not disclose its curated list of web3 platforms, but examples of institution-friendly DeFi include things like Aave Arc, Compound Treasury and offerings like Maple Finance.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/09/12/bafin-licensed-crypto-custodian-finoa-will-offer-regulated-defi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d399ebfa3e04cb916dadd48c7e0d70171824e232-3500x2333.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A recent price analysis reveals a bearish order block at $3.6 on FIL’s one-day chart, with a closely tested liquidity zone at $3 over the past month. This downward trend has persisted since early August, as evidenced by a sequence of lower highs and lower lows. On the weekly chart, two key levels have held significant sway over FIL’s fortunes since June 2022. The resistance at $4.8 and the support at $2.42 have acted as formidable barriers and lifelines, respectively. Analysis suggests that a breakthrough above the $4.8 resistance could signify the first step toward establishing a long-term uptrend. Furthermore, the presence of a bearish breaker block in the 1-week timeframe, spanning from $4.6 to $5.7, reinforces this notion. Related Reading: Massive PEPE Token Dump: Whale Unloads 762 Billion At Loss As Price Wobbles Filecoin Bearish Signals Abound The same analysis highlights that technical indicators have been unforgiving for FIL, with both the On-Balance Volume (OBV) and Relative Strength Index (RSI) painting a grim picture. The OBV has been in a consistent downward trajectory since mid-July, indicative of sustained selling pressure. FIL market cap currently at $1.3 billion on the daily chart: TradingView.com Meanwhile, the RSI exhibits bearish momentum, recording a reading of 31 and consistently residing below the neutral 50 mark since late July. These combined signals strongly suggest that FIL may experience a drop below $3 and trend towards $2.4 in the weeks ahead. As of the time of writing, the current CoinGecko price for Filecoin (FIL) stands at $3.04. Over the past 24 hours, FIL has experienced a decline of 1.7%, while the seven-day period has seen a slump of 4.3%. These recent declines add to the challenges that FIL has been facing in its price action. Filecon seven-day price movement. Source: Coingecko Investor Perspective: A Silver Lining For Filecoin Despite the prevailing challenges, some seasoned investors are turning their attention to Filecoin. A report cites Filecoin’s unique value proposition, an accomplished team, and an incentivized mechanism as reasons for optimism. Filecoin, as a decentralized data storage system, allows users to securely store and retrieve data in a decentralized manner. Its expert team is committed to ensuring its continued development and success. Moreover, the incentive mechanism rewards users with FIL tokens for sharing their storage space, fostering a robust and self-sustaining ecosystem. Filecoin’s technical indicators may currently signal a challenging road ahead, with a downtrend seemingly in progress. However, some investors remain undeterred, recognizing the project’s unique strengths and the potential for a brighter future. As the cryptocurrency market is ever-volatile, only time will reveal whether Filecoin can overcome its current obstacles and thrive in the long run.

He has previously pleaded not guilty to multiple counts of fraud and manipulating the price of the CEL token, charges his lawyers have said are “baseless.” Now they say the court should also dismiss FTC claims that he misled investors.  “The allegations do not support a claim that Mashinsky knowingly made a misstatement to fraudulently obtain customer information from a financial institution” as is required under a 1999 law known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Mashinsky’s lawyers said in the Monday filing.  Mashinsky, alongside his former Chief Technology Officer Hanoch “Nuke” Goldstein, argued the FTC would need to make more rules before taking on novel cases such as marketing fraud. In a separate filing, Goldstein said he was being unjustly held guilty by association with other Celsius executives, with the FTC depending on the fact that he retweeted a blog by Celsius.  In parallel, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams asked the court to put FTC proceedings on hold to avoid prejudicing the parallel criminal case.

42419654,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFD6D,1694495137,Bitcoin Short Squeeze Lifts Prices Back to $26K,"Bitcoin (BTC) jumped to nearly $26,000 during the asian trading hours on Tuesday, reversing Monday's decline to three-month lows under $25,000.  The move could be best described as a short squeeze – a rally powered by an unwinding of bearish derivative bets.  As prices jumped, cumulative open interest in futures and perpetual swaps trading on Binance, Bybit, OKX and Deribit fell from $5.05 billion to $4.8 billion. Open interest refers to the dollar value locked in the number of active or open positions.  The decline in open interest seemed to stem from shorts abandoning their bearish bets, as funding rates flipped positive around the same time.  Funding rates refer to costs associated with holding bullish or bearish bets in perpetual swaps (futures with no expiry). Negative rates imply leverage is skewed on the bearish side, while positive rates suggest otherwise.  ""[It's] a textbook short squeeze,"" pseudonymous trader and analyst @52kskew said on X.  Bitcoin and alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) fell Monday as fears of potential selling pressure from bankrupt crypto exchange FTX roiled market sentiment.  Though impressive, the price recovery from crucial support at $25,000 may remain capped due to a lack of immediate bullish catalysts. The bitcoin spot ETF optimism has faded, with observers shifting focus to the impending liquidation of FTX's altcoin holdings.  Per some observers, the bias remains bearish while prices are held below the 50-day simple moving average.  ""Bitcoin price is $25,836 below the 50-day moving average of $27,731 - which is bearish - and the week over price price decreased by 0.5%. Ethereum (ETH) price is $1,617 below the 50-day moving average $1,752 - which is bearish - and the week over price decreased by 1.1%.

""All the evidence in this matter—including documents, declarations, and sworn deposition testimony—supports BAM’s position that it has custody and control of its digital assets.""  In June, the SEC alleged that Binance CEO Changpeng 'CZ' Zhao and Guangying 'Helina' Chen funneled billions of customer funds through intermediary companies, citing testimony evidence from an SEC accountant.  At the time, Binance and CZ publicly denied all claims. In the filing, BAM writes that CZ has confirmed that it does not have custody or control over the private keys for customer assets on the exchange.  The SEC sought an asset freeze on Binance.US, though the request was declined by a U.S. judge, which ordered the two to begin negotiations on continued operations.  In the filing, BAM questioned the extent of requests by the SEC, including documents related to the exchange’s custody software and wallet solutions.  “The SEC has still not articulated why depositions of BAM’s CEO and CFO fall within the scope of the Consent Order,” the exchange wrote. “The burden imposed by these depositions far outweighs their potential benefit, and the discovery sought is disproportionate to the needs contemplated by the Consent Order.""

Other proposed witnesses, like Capital University Law School Professor Bradley Smith – a former Federal Election Commissioner – can provide context for issues like how political contributions are normally made, the filing said.  Another witness would help the jury understand FTX's terms of service, the filing claimed.  Joseph Pimbley, another consultant, can help explain FTX's software, the filing said. While the DOJ intends to call former FTX executives Gary Wang and Nishad Singh to testify about this, their ""credibility"" is questionable due to their being cooperating witnesses for the prosecution, the filing said.  Prosecutors, for their part, also pushed back against the defense team's motion to block University of Notre Dame Professor Peter Easton, saying the defense's motion mischaracterized what Easton would say.  ""Professor Easton’s testimony about customer fiat deposits will be descriptive, not prescriptive,"" the filing said. ""He will describe, for instance, whether customer fiat deposits were kept in segregated bank accounts; not whether it was improper to commingle customers’ funds. He will describe whether balances in bank accounts receiving customer funds matched the balances in FTX’s transaction database and ledger; not whether it was improper if they did not match.""

Attorneys for Bankman-Fried and the DOJ filed their proposed jury questions late Monday, just three weeks before the FTX founder's trial on seven criminal charges is set to begin. The proposals are intended to identify if any of the possible jurors are familiar with the case, with crypto or with effective altruism, the philosophy that purportedly motivated Bankman-Fried to get rich so he could give his wealth away. The questions, which largely appear to be standard questions for a jury ahead of a trial, also ask if if the potential jurors have opinions on issues like political donations and lobbying or the legal system.  Both sets of proposed questions ask if the potential jurors know or have ""had any dealings"" with the prosecutors and defense attorneys, as well as possible witnesses (though the witness names have not yet been fully shared). Other questions appear similarly standard, asking for the prospective jurors' backgrounds, occupations and if they've had any direct dealings or knowledge of FTX and Alameda Research.  ""The function of the jury is to decide questions of fact,"" the DOJ's proposed questions suggested the judge say. ""You are the sole judge of the facts and nothing that the Court or the lawyers say or do may encroach in any way on your role as the exclusive fact-finder. When it comes to the law, however, you are to take your instructions from the Court, and you are bound by those instructions. You may not substitute your own notions of what the law is, or what you think it should be.""  The filings follow last month's proposed jury instructions, which are meant to be conveyed to the actual jurors trying the case.  Bankman-Fried's attorneys have spent the past few weeks trying to have their client temporarily released from jail to work on his defense, arguing that prosecutors' assertions that he has laptop access are overly rosy.  His bail was revoked last month after Judge Lewis Kaplan, of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, found he had attempted to tamper with witnesses on at least two occasions. While the defense has appealed this decision, an appeals court has yet to hear the arguments and the judge has held off on making any decision about his jail conditions so far.  An attorney with experience in white collar litigation told CoinDesk that jury selection could typically only take a few hours, but for a case as complex as Bankman-Fried's, it may take up to a few days. During the actual voir dire process, the judge will look for obvious biases.

Its premium or discount to Bitcoin’s net asset value (NAV), often viewed as an indicator of institutional sentiment towards the cryptocurrency, has displayed a notable trend recently, even amid the prevailing bearish atmosphere. GBTC’s Evolving Price Dynamics The phenomenon of GBTC’s share price inching closer to Bitcoin’s market price is worth noting. The correlation between the two has been historically significant, with price differences often shedding light on broader market sentiments. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly TD Sequential Buy Setup Appears, But Warns Of Potential Risk According to data from CoinGlass, a renowned crypto monitoring platform, the GBTC shares were recorded trading at a 17.17% discount to the BTC/USD rate as of September 9th, the last update. Such levels haven’t been witnessed since December 2021, highlighting a potentially shifting sentiment in the market. The so-called “GBTC Premium,” previously a surplus, has been a discount to the net asset value for a while now. The shift was drastic at one juncture that the differences neared roughly 50% last November. Such variance has led to a divergence between GBTC’s performance and Bitcoin’s price strength, especially as Bitcoin revisits price zones it hasn’t seen in the past six months. What This Could Mean For Bitcoin The narrowing of GBTC’s discount isn’t just an isolated event. It paints a broader picture of potential market sentiment shifts and future movements. Notably, a shrinking discount can be interpreted as a sign of growing institutional interest, as the GBTC serves as a prominent avenue for institutions to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. If institutional interest is indeed on the rise, this could bode well for Bitcoin’s mid to long-term price outlook. Related Reading: GBTC Shares See Volumes Climb To 2-Year High Amid Grayscale’s Victory Lap Nevertheless, Bitcoin is currently seeing a downtrend. The asset has plunged nearly 15% in the past month and 2% in the last 24 hours. As a result, its price has fallen below the recently established $26,000 mark, trading at $25,175 at the time of writing.
