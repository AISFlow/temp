42379948,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LJ0v,1506895225,Guns & Crypto: How Bitcoin Is Helping Keep Cody Wilson's Anarchist Dream Alive,"Cody Wilson is expecting a nice bump in sales from bitcoin's rising price.  The controversial founder of Defense Distributed, a manufacturer of machines for 3D-printed firearms, told CoinDesk that despite its niche appeal, his company is flourishing. Founded in 2012, Defense Distributed has evolved into a multimillion-dollar operation that today generates 10 percent of its revenue from bitcoin.  But it's not particularly surprising the cryptocurrency community would be supportive of the project. Wilson has been a part of the scene for some time, most notably helping Amir Taaki co-create DarkMarket, a peer-to-peer online marketplace designed to sidestep legal and regulatory restrictions through its use of bitcoin.  If past trends are any indication, this support should not only continue but grow – according to Wilson, the company is gearing up for its most lucrative quarter yet.  Last year, Defense Distributed generated $2.7 million in revenue, a 7 percent increase year-over-year, and to date Wilson says it's sold about 4,000 machines. This year, however, Wilson expects that figure to escalate thanks to the increased willingness of bitcoin holders to spend as the value of their holdings increases.  He told CoinDesk:  ""As bitcoin crested $2,000, we saw more purchases in bitcoin. Because, hell, one bitcoin gets you a gun machine now, and that's a good trade.""  A self-described cryptoanarchist, Wilson's work with both 3D-printed guns without serial numbers, and cryptocurrency itself, is part of his work to circumnavigate government controls – an idea that some members of the cryptocurrency community have proved particularly responsive to.  So, to provide his customers with a better tool to drive that process, Wilson has today revealed he's upgrading his latest Ghost Gunner 2 gun printer.  Not only has the machine's firmware been updated to make the printer more accurate, but a number of hardware upgrades – including a spindle capable of turning metal powder into incredibly detailed pistols – have been added to make the finished products look and act more like traditional handguns.  ""This is basically the beginning of the automated manufacturing of untraceable handguns of a commercial grade, not of bizarre, 3D printed quality,"" Wilson said.  Not only is Wilson seeing an uptick in sales from bitcoin's continued appreciation, but other gun sellers are too. In an interview with CoinDesk, Michael Cargill, the owner of Central Texas Gun Works, said his gun sales typically increase when the bitcoin price goes up.  ""Whenever bitcoin goes up, I get customers from all over the country who want to buy guns,"" he said, adding:  ""When we first started doing this back in 2013, bitcoin was about $200. Now, it’s peaked at $4,700, and a lot of people are cashing in.""  Cargill noted that his shop, which has Wilson's Ghost Gunner 2 on sale, would have seen a drop in total sales this year if not for bitcoin. About 45 percent of his revenue comes from cryptocurrency, he said.  Such a percentage of sales from bitcoin is doubly notable, seeing how Cargill can't do business with bitcoin merchant services firms like BitPay because of their policies against on-boarding guns-and-ammo businesses – a policy which BitPay said still exists, thought the initial press release detailing the policy has been removed.  BitPay and other merchant services providers have taken a conservative approach to high-risk merchants like Central Texas Gun Works, which means those businesses typically have to do a lot of the upfront acceptance work themselves.  And that hesitance to work with high-risk verticals is unlikely to change anytime soon.  Wilson has felt this himself, seeing strong opposition to his work in the gray area between building a machine that makes guns and actually making guns.  Back in May 2013, the files he used to print the guns were seized by the Department of Justice. Then, last year, Wilson suffered a setback when the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals refused to give him the First Amendment protections he sought for the files.  Yet, a niche community of developers has sprouted up offering their own open-source contributions to the 3D-printed gun industry, even in spite of the ongoing risk.  In spite of the obstacles, Wilson continues to push forward in disrupting the $51.3 billion gun sector, expecting to keep the Ghost Gunner 2's price steady at $1,500 in an effort to attract more sales with the price of bitcoin currently around $4,300.  ""We're going to hype this like we always do,"" said Wilson, concluding:  ""I assume we're going to have good sales in the fourth quarter here.""  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in BitPay.

42379941,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LIyP,1506863705,Sea Change? Deloitte Is Tracking Management Systems Certificates with Blockchain,"Deloitte is taking non-financial applications of blockchain technology into uncharted waters.  To record management systems, products, supply chain, and facilities certificates for companies on a private, shared ledger, the consulting firm's blockchain lab for Europe, the Middle East and Africa recently partnered with DNV GL, one of the world's largest classification societies.  Such companies certify that their processes meet acceptable standards for safety and environmental impact. But, the certificates they issue can be forged, potentially undermining trust in the system. Further, checking that a certificate is real is a slow, cumbersome process.  Deloitte and Norway-based DNV GL see blockchain technology as the answer to both problems.  Their solution creates a digital ID of each certificate that is stored and accessed on a private blockchain. The decentralized approach is seen as a way to discourage fraud or otherwise tampering with the documents.  Lory Kehoe, Deloitte's EMEA blockchain lead, explained:  ""Instead of one record being held on one server, it's held over many, many systems.""  Digital transformation    The existing system for issuing certifications had been in need of digital transformation, said Kehoe. ""Some parts were manual, some parts weren't exactly digital.""      One problem with the legacy system is that users need to go to a company's website or send an email to check a certificate's authenticity. This can now be done instantly with a blockchain, explained Renato Grottola, director of global digital transformation for DNV GL, which formed from a merger between DNV and Germany's GL in 2013.      He told CoinDesk:    ""Anyone can, by scanning the QR code on the certificate, check its validity and data. With the one-to-one connection between the certificate and the blockchain, verification is instant and easily done with a mobile device.""  ""As the original data is stored and updated in the blockchain, it will quickly reveal whether a certificate is authentic or not,"" he said.  The solution was officially deployed September 23, with 90,000 certificates currently on the private blockchain.  ""It is quite early after the deployment, but feedback received so far has been positive,"" said Grottola.  Protecting reputations  DNV GL's business is based on trust and authenticity with industries trusting its certificates to be what they say they are – but that is an increasingly difficult balance to maintain.  ""You can spend a lifetime building a reputation and it takes seconds for it to fall apart,"" explained Kehoe:  ""All it takes is one or two scenarios where DNV GL have put their name to something and another company in another part of the world replicates that and DNV GL's name gets tarnished.""  It can take another lifetime trying to disprove those falsehoods and rebuild a reputation. Kehoe said he believes that Deloitte's blockchain deployment will prevent that.  ""In the world of certification, other companies presume we're looking at this,"" said Kehoe. ""If I was in the business insurance industry myself beyond DNV GL, I would have been looking strongly at blockchain.""  The International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) is an organization whose members include DNV GL. A spokesperson told CoinDesk that it is currently neutral on blockchain, saying: ""IACS does not have a position on blockchain technology and has not discussed this matter to date.""  However, IACS recently appointed DNV GL's CEO, Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen, as its new chairman and upon his appointment, he spoke of the need to prioritize digitization.  London-based Lloyd's Register, a competitor of DNV GL, on the other hand, said it is ""is actively working at real-world applications of blockchain and distributed ledger technologies with our clients and partners.""  A spokesperson for Lloyd's Register added:  ""We believe blockchain and distribute ledger technology has wider applicability in industrial applications, especially around increasing transparency in supply chains and around safety and reducing risk.""  Grottola said DNV GL was aware that some its competitors are looking at blockchain initiatives and it was ""keenly observing"" new entrants in the market.  Growing trend  DNV GL's blockchain solution is part of a growing trend of non-financial services firms turning to the technology.  Deloitte's Kehoe said he has seen a notable increase in the number of such queries over the last nine to 12 months, and that clients are now coming to Deloitte with a greater understanding of blockchain technology.  ""The work we're doing now is kind of skipping the [proof of concept] phase because our clients understand the technology,"" he said. ""They're coming to us with use cases with a clear problem to solve.""  He explained:  ""We're not talking about experiments anymore in dark rooms where people are playing with this technology. It's now all about how do we integrate the technology in a meaningful way so that it solves the problem – it creates an opportunity, helping companies stay relevant, I think that’s a very important point too.""

42379929,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LIkZ,1506855601,How to Legitimize the ICO Market (Crypto Lawyers Take Note),"Jacek Czarnecki is a lawyer specializing in blockchain technology and a general counsel at Neufund.  In this opinion piece, he explains why his profession should play a critical role in the growth and maturation of the ICO market.      Recently, I set out to analyze the terms of various initial coin offerings (ICOs), aggregate the results and make them public. This was harder than I expected.  It turns out that very often ICO terms and conditions are not publicly available immediately after the token sale is completed. This is true even in the case of some of the most successful, very prominent ICOs. A token holder cannot even read the terms unless he or she remembered to save them on a hard drive during the ICO.  This is but one example of a standard that I think most of us would prefer not to take hold in the market. And it underscores the need for more engaged lawyers, openness towards clear communication of legal topics and more legally aware entrepreneurs in a promising but fraught young industry.  The old world is watching  It's hard to keep up with ICOs, with more than 100 such sales completed so far this year, raking in well over $1 billion, according to CoinDesk's ICO Tracker. But it's not just about the surge of funds raised through token sales. One sign pointing to the growing maturity of this market is the interest it receives from the old world.  By ""old world,"" I mean mainstream institutions and firms, as well as their representatives. While previously cryptocurrencies and various blockchain applications also have stirred up a lot of hype (e.g. among banks), it seems that tokens and ICOs have triggered another large wave of interest.  Venture capital is just one example of that. Within a year, ICOs and tokens have become one of the major topics in the industry. A slightly different example is regulators, who have issued a series of positions in several important jurisdictions in recent weeks.  Additionally, there is also another group in the old world experiencing a growing fascination with ICOs: lawyers. The trend can be measured by the unbelievable number of new legal publications, the opening of blockchain practices and departments in numerous law firms, the number of lawyers who include the word ""blockchain"" in their LinkedIn profiles, and so on.  This has happened for at least a few reasons, the first being that blockchain by itself is a captivating subject for lawyers; the concept of smart contracts, for example.  But there is also a very practical reason why lawyers want to deal with tokens and ICOs: it's a new market for their services. While still a niche subject of expertise, there is serious money involved and huge potential for continued growth.  There is also a huge demand for legal services. Legal support is usually needed in all major transactions, but in the case of ICOs, this is particularly important because the demand for lawyers is fueled by legal uncertainty and regulators' approaches.  'Case-by-case' approach  Any lawyer who's dealt with blockchain issues knows that legal uncertainty is nothing new here. But in the case of ICOs, it has become particularly evident.  Now, after the announcement of regulator positions in some major jurisdictions (the U.S. and China included), it may seem that the regulatory situation is starting to become much clearer. And in a way it is.  But when we look into the details, very often the general conclusion is that ""tokens might or might not be securities."" Not very edifying, is it?  I don't judge the regulators here. It's not new that a general, functional approach is being applied to complex, unprecedented technologies that are not specifically regulated.  I just want to underline that, so far, the ""case-by-case"" approach dominates – you have to conduct an extensive legal analysis of an ICO and its underlying tokens, and so on, in each individual case, and sometimes seek a dialogue with the regulators.  In practice, the case-by-case approach means that you need to involve lawyers in each case. Good for lawyers, but not necessarily for entrepreneurs.  Lawyers' responsibility  Lawyers should not, however, just rest on their laurels.  In the ICO market, we need to develop legal standards. My anecdote about searching in vain for legal documentation for ICOs is a stark illustration of this. Who should craft these standards, if not lawyers?  Without such standards, the ICO market might never really take off. Despite technological development, entrepreneurs might be stuck in swamp of legal uncertainty. Developing those standards requires good legal analysis that goes beyond a particular use case, but also a willingness to share knowledge, cooperate with competitors (which pays off over the long term) and sometimes spend unbillable hours on community work.  Many lawyers already do that job well.  But this development won't happen without strong cooperation between lawyers and market participants. After all, legal standards are just a subset of market standards. The lawyers' work will not make much sense beyond particular business cases if entrepreneurs aren't open to speaking about legal aspects of their business openly.  The market also needs lawyers to effectively talk to policymakers.  Lawyers are well-suited to becoming transmitters of know-how from the market to lawmakers and regulators. They should clearly define market needs and regulatory issues, educating policymakers and proposing appropriate regulations.  This goes well beyond lobbying activity and should rather be perceived as community development work.
