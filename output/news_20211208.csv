42375759,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwANl5,1639006200,"First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Holds Steady as Crypto CEOs Testify, Ether Climbs","Good morning. Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market moves: Bitcoin moved little as the market watched six crypto leaders testify before Congress  Technician’s take: Selling pressure could slow heading into the Asia trading day as indicators appear oversold.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $50,676 +0.5%  Ether (ETH): $4,422 +3.33%  Markets  S&P 500: $4,701 +0.3%  Dow Jones Industrial Average: $35,754 +.09%  Nasdaq: $15,786 +0.6%  Gold: $1,783 -0.9%  Market moves  Bitcoin hovered at around $50,000 on Wednesday, as the crypto market closely observed the CEOs of six major crypto companies share their opinions on regulation with the U.S. House Financial Services Committee. Ether spent a good part of the day at over $4,400.  At the time of publication, bitcoin was changing hands at $50,676, up slightly over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data. Trading volume on major centralized exchanges fell again on Wednesday.  A good portion of the crypto world on Wednesday was focusing on the congressional hearing on digital currencies and stablecoins. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire, FTX Trading CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, Bitfury CEO Brian Brooks, Paxos CEO Charles Cascarilla, Stellar Development Foundation CEO Denelle Dixon and Coinbase Global Chief Financial Officer Alesia Haas all testified. CoinDesk’s Nikhilesh De live blogged the hearing, and the full coverage can be found here.  Amid Cascarilla’s participation, stellar (XLM) prices rose by roughly 6% on Wednesday. The performance of XLM tokens hasn’t been impressive on a relative basis, up just about 98.6% over the past year versus ether’s 691% increase during the same time period.  Stocks rose on Wednesday again as fears about the Omicron coronavirus continued to fade. Investors’ rising appetite for risk assets came after Pfizer and BioNTech announced that initial lab studies showed a third dose of their COVID-19 vaccine could “neutralize” the new variant. That could potentially benefit the crypto market, as it usually follows the stock market.  Technician’s take  Bitcoin Range-Bound Above $46K Support, Resistance at $55K  Bitcoin (BTC) continues to stabilize at about $50,000 after a near 20% sell-off over the past weekend.  For now, the cryptocurrency remains above $46,000 support, which could stabilize short-term pullbacks. Buyers will need to break above $55,000 resistance to yield further upside targets.  Momentum signals are improving on intraday charts, which suggests buyers could remain active at around current support levels. And the relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is the most oversold since late September, which preceded a price rally.  Bitcoin is stuck in a short-term downtrend, defined by lower price highs over the past month. Price indicators, however, suggest selling pressure could slow heading into the Asia trading day. That means intraday trading volume could rise around the 100-period moving average (currently around $54,500) on the four-hour chart.

Bitcoin&apos;s price had taken a plunge towards $40K and had brought a lot of losses with it as billions of dollars in long positions were liquidated on December 4th in one of the sharpest declines of the year. Mostly this has brought down a number of metrics associated with the asset but on-chain signals remain resistant. On-chain data all ranging from miner revenues, transaction fees, hashrate, and daily transaction volumes have all shown positive trends for bitcoin.

42375747,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwANZl,1639002912,Foundry Launches Resale Marketplace for Bitcoin Mining Machines,"Digital asset mining and staking firm Foundry Digital has launched FoundryX, a new marketplace for buying and selling bitcoin mining machines, the company announced Wednesday. Foundry is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which is the parent company of CoinDesk.  “With the industry’s leading clients and partners, from machine manufacturers to mining companies, we have the market knowledge and data to match the right buyers and sellers, at the right price,” Foundry Vice President of Business Development Jeff Burkey said in a statement.  The company has secured over 40,000 of the latest-generation mining machines from MicroBT and Bitmain for immediate delivery through 2022 for the new marketplace. For now, the company will be providing new machines only that it has sourced from manufacturers, Foundry’s own inventory, its network of resellers and its existing clients, according to a statement emailed to CoinDesk.  New push  FoundryX is aimed at small, mid- and large-scale miners looking to upgrade or expand their operations, but is not designed for small-scale retail clients. “However, we do support several companies that offer services to retail and are proponents of fully decentralized networks,” according to the email.  The move comes as supply-chain bottlenecks and global chip shortages have made it difficult for North American miners to secure machines from Asia in a timely fashion.  Foundry also noted that some resellers, including those in Asia, require significant wire deposits to reserve machines, which has made the process even more challenging for potential customers. Foundry’s new business will work to address these issues by connecting buyers and sellers via a “trusted and reliable U.S.-based secondary market for mining machines,” the company said.  Read more: Compass Mining Launches Resale Market for Bitcoin Mining Equipment  The main advantage for a client ordering mining machines through FoundryX is the ability to customize the size and payment terms based on their needs, Foundry’s spokesperson said. Typically, manufacturers require monthly minimum commitments and large deposits six months or longer prior to delivery, whereas with the new marketplace customers will have more flexibility, the spokesperson said.  In November, Compass Mining, a bitcoin mining service provider, also launched a secondary resale market for retail mining customers to sell bitcoin mining hardware. The company’s CEO, Whit Gibbs, said that hundreds of millions of dollars in miners are being sold on the secondary market every month, indicating high demand.  Foundry has already completed over $125 million in hardware sales this year, prior to officially launching the marketplace business today.  Foundry said that its existing clients can also request additional enterprise-grade services which include financing, shipping, logistics and pooled mining through Foundry USA Pool.

42375762,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwANmL,1639002861,Bitcoin Adoption Among Far-Right Extremists Leaves Its Mark on the Blockchain,"Bitcoin as a means of payment among far-right extremists is growing in popularity, according to cryptocurrency analytics firm Elliptic, which is tracking traces left on the blockchain by such groups.  A flight to censorship-resistant crypto by far-right actors has been driven in recent years by large internet platforms like PayPal blocking extremists, with deplatforming efforts starting in earnest following Charlottesville’s bloody “Unite the Right” rally in August 2017.  Some prominent far-right extremists have even gone as far as declaring that bitcoin is now the currency of the alt-right. This matters because domestic terrorism in the U.S. associated with such groups is on the rise.  It turns out many right-wing extremists actually want to leave their mark on the blockchain. No doubt beguiled by the immutability of bitcoin transactions, wallets belonging to alt-right enthusiasts can often be identified by amounts including hate symbol “1488″ – 0.001488 BTC is about $50 at today’s prices.  It’s like leaving a swastika on the blockchain, explains Elliptic co-founder Tom Robinson, since the number “14″ is numerical shorthand for the white supremacist slogan known as the “14 Words” and “88″ maps to “H,” the eighth letter of the alphabet, signaling “Heil Hitler.”  The proportion of bitcoin transactions that contain the number 1488 was about 30,000 times larger than for your average wallet, Elliptic said in a blog post published today.  “We looked into whether we can use that model to proactively identify new far-right extremist wallets,” Robinson told CoinDesk in an interview. “We were able to identify about 100 new wallets that were then found to be linked to far-right extremist activity.”  The payments and fundraising activity that Elliptic has mapped amounts to some $8.9 million. In the case of one extremist, 47% of all payments received were for amounts containing “1488,” Robinson said.  “I’m not sure whether alt-right groups realized that they were allowing this activity to be monitored and identified in the blockchain to the extent that we’re now doing,” Robinson said of the public nature of the Bitcoin blockchain. “But I do think there’s a sort of, ‘Look at me, look what I’m doing’ kind of aspect of this that they like.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/12/08/bitcoin-adoption-among-far-right-extremists-leaves-its-mark-on-the-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6a0120a77cdbb41ece32e78fb74ce089fcb68a45-750x549.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42422868,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qYrh,1639002830,Visa Launches Crypto Advisory Services for Banks as Demand for Digital Assets Grows,"Payments giant Visa has formed a global crypto advisory practice to help financial institutions develop their cryptocurrency businesses as demand for crypto products continues to grow, the company said in a statement Wednesday.  “We think it’s a critical role for Visa to play to help be this bridge between banks and the crypto ecosystem,” Cuy Sheffield, Visa’s head of crypto, told CoinDesk. “Every bank should have a crypto strategy.”  Visa’s crypto advisory team will work alongside the company’s consulting and analytics group to advise banks on their crypto strategy and execution, as well as to help banks build crypto teams.  Sheffield says there’s been an inflection point over the last nine months in which banks have started to recognize their consumers want access to crypto. Meanwhile, they also want to figure out how they can better serve crypto businesses such as exchanges and wallets, according to Sheffield.  In a recent study conducted by Visa, 18% of global participants revealed they would be likely or very likely to switch their primary bank to one offering crypto-related products over the next year. In emerging markets, that figure rose to 24%. And for consumers who already own cryptocurrency, Visa’s study found that almost 40% of participants expressed a willingness to switch their banks to ones offering crypto products.

42375765,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwANrN,1639002782,Market Wrap: Cryptocurrencies Stabilize as Some Traders Buy the Dip,"Bitcoin was roughly flat over the past 24 hours as buyers attempted to continue to reverse some of last weekend’s losses. Some short-term traders are buying on dips, while others remain cautious about what crypto prices will be over the next month.  “In spite of the shock sell-off, volatility markets remain relatively calm. The knee-jerk spike in BTC and ETH implied volatility faded very quickly and the volatility term structure reverted to an upward sloping one, indicating no heightened fear or panic in the near-term,” crypto trading firm QCP Capital wrote in a Telegram announcement.  Also, Three Arrows Capital, a Singapore-based hedge fund, purchased more than 90,000 ETH worth about $400 million over the weekend, according to wallet data shown on Etherscan. The move comes mere weeks after co-founder Su Zhu “abandoned” Ethereum because of its prohibitively high fees for new users, CoinDesk’s Lyllah Ledesma reported.  Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $50,835, +0.81%  Ether (ETH): $4,422, +3.21%  S&P 500: $4,701, +0.32%  Gold: $1,785, +0.07%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.52%  From a technical perspective, the recent sell-off reflects a “loss of intermediate-term momentum that serves as an impetus to reduce exposure to bitcoin and cryptocurrencies broadly,” Katie Stockton, managing partner at Fairlead Strategies, a technical research firm, wrote in a report this week.  Still, ether’s outperformance of late is unusual in a market where traders are wary of riskier assets, Stockton noted. “ETH’s long-term uptrend has not been impacted by its pullback – long-term momentum is still to the upside,” she wrote.  On the regulatory front, the U.S. House Financial Services Committee grilled six crypto executives about trading and stablecoins in a hearing on Wednesday. Discussions focused on security frameworks, the anonymous nature of crypto transactions and how Congress can incorporate digital assets into existing regulatory standards. Read CoinDesk’s live coverage here.  Bitcoin in fear mode  The Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index declined to its lowest level since late July during the weekend sell-off. Some analysts view the index as a contrarian signal, suggesting that buyers could return to buy BTC on price dips. Previous “extreme fear” readings preceded price rallies similar to what occurred in August and October.  Returns narrow  Bitcoin’s year-to-date return has narrowed relative to the S&P 500 over the past month. Still, despite the recent sell-off, bitcoin is up about 75%, compared with a roughly 22% return in the S&P 500 and a 34% return in the Thomson Reuters Core Commodity CRB Index so far this year.  On a related note, bitcoin’s Sharpe ratio (risk-adjusted return) is comparable to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq over the past year, according to data compiled by IntoTheBlock.  Altcoin roundup  Polygon’s MATIC token surges amid crypto recovery: MATIC is up about 25% over the past week, compared with an 11% decline in BTC over the same period. The increase occurred as more users have become aware of Polygon’s lower costs and greater efficiency and scalability. Speculation has also mounted over what the firm has called an “exciting announcement” scheduled for Thursday at Polygon virtual “zk day.”  Not all alternative cryptocurrencies move in stride with ETH: While some decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens are correlated with ether, metaverse tokens such as The Sandbox’s SAND and Decentraland’s MANA have been less correlated with ether, according to a statistical study by Coin Metrics. “Some tokens on Ethereum today seem to be garnering narratives that are less tied to ETH itself, showing the potential benefits to diversification,” Coin Metrics wrote.  Inside EIP 4488: Last week, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin introduced Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4488, an upgrade that could drive down transaction costs for Ethereum rollups like Arbitrum, Optimism and zkSync. The proposal detailed the immediate steps for pushing gas fees down without sacrificing security, as well as the road map for moving forward post-”Merge.” CoinDesk’s Edward Oosterbaan explored some of the ideas contained in the proposal here.

The project has been hard hit by devastating price action, with the price of SUSHI down 51.2% on the month to $5.95, and by rumors of infighting since the departure of pseudonymous de-facto leader 0xMaki in September.  “I highly recommend the installation of a C-suite from outside the DAO and give them the tools to effectively manage a team. Be wary of any self-proclaimed leaders arising from the current core team,” Delong wrote on Twitter, referring to a decentralized autonomous organization.  Delong, a longtime Ethereum and Web 3 contributor, has worked on an Eth 2.0 client for ConsenSys, contributed to the MolochDAO Ethereum infrastructure fundraising organization and worked on Dapper Labs’ Flow blockchain. He’s known for his outspoken Twitter presence and competitive attitude.  In addition to the tweet thread, Delong also announced the resignation on-chain with a transaction sent to the Sushi treasury multi-sig. The transaction failed.  Sushi is looking to release Trident, a major upgrade expected to include a variety of automated market maker (AMM) models connected through Tines, an order-routing engine, as well as BentoBox, a yield-bearing base layer for the various AMMs. Sushi’s primary product is a fork of Uniswap v2 that is deployed on various blockchains.

Number Of Active Bitcoin Addresses Reach Seven-Month High As per the latest weekly report from Arcane Research, the crash during the weekend woke up sleeping Bitcoin investors as the number of active addresses observes a significant increase. The &apos;number of active addresses&apos; is a Bitcoin indicator that measures the amount of addresses that showed some activity on the chain during a particular day. If an addresses makes more than one move in a given day, the metric still only counts it as one active address. Because of this, the indicator may tell us an accurate picture about how many BTC holders shifted their coins that day. When the number of active addresses rise in value, it means market activity is going up, and previously dormant addresses could be coming back up.

Digital assets will take center stage in front of Congress on Wednesday.  The full House Financial Services Committee is set to meet this morning to discuss cryptocurrencies and stablecoins with Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire, FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, Bitfury CEO Brian Brooks, Paxos CEO Charles Cascarilla, Stellar Development Foundation CEO Denelle Dixon and Coinbase Inc. CEO Alesia Haas (who is also chief financial officer of the Coinbase Global parent company).  A hearing memo briefly details both the current outstanding issues regulators are focusing on, such as stablecoins, as well as what the current market looks like. The memo’s authors focus much of their attention on questions of investor protection and market integrity.  “Cryptocurrency markets have no overarching and centralized regulatory framework, leaving investments in the digital assets space vulnerable to fraud, manipulation and abuse,” the memo says, but it also notes that many exchanges and stablecoin issuers have received state money transmitter licenses or trust charters, and Paxos in particular has a conditional trust charter through the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a federal bank regulator.  And unlike some of the past hearings held by the committee, today’s meeting will be a full committee hearing, giving each of the more than 50 members a chance to ask questions or clarify any concerns they have about the industry.  Crypto marathon  The lawmakers aren’t expected to debate the merits of any specific legislative proposal to regulate crypto during this hearing, though Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio) has already tweeted about his Token Taxonomy Act, which has been introduced several times but has not been voted on by the House.  However, various reports by regulatory groups and requests by specific regulators may be discussed, such as last month’s President’s Working Group on Financial Markets report on stablecoin regulation.  The witness statements largely lay out the various crypto executives’ businesses, as well as provide some suggestions on how lawmakers can address regulatory shortfalls.  Circle’s Allaire homed in on the current lack of specific stablecoin regulations in his prepared remarks – a key area of concern for regulators.  “There is much work to do in defining the reserve, liquidity and capital requirements, and the risk management and operational resilience requirements for global-scale stablecoin issuers,” Allaire said in his opening remarks.  Brooks, the former acting comptroller who briefly helmed Binance.US before his BitFury role, said crypto activities are already occurring outside of the regulatory framework, but it makes sense for a legislative proposal to bring these activities under the supervision of federal regulators.  He pointed to stablecoin issuers as one example, asking if it was “consistent to take the position that only banks should be allowed to issue stablecoins, but then fail to grant bank charters to the largest issuers of stablecoins.”  The Senate Banking Committee will follow up with a hearing on stablecoins next Tuesday.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/12/08/crypto-ceos-hit-capitol-hill-heres-what-to-expect,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

The startup will use the funds to scale its operations and build a policy and workflow manager that sits on top of its ID verification system.  The capital came from a new $10 million Series A round and a previously unannounced $3.5 million seed round. Other participating investors included Lakestar, Eniac Ventures and Cowboy Ventures.  Passbase helps companies automate the identity verification process to meet regulations for anti-money laundering (AML), know your customer (KYC) and age restriction requirements around the world. The developer-focused product covers over 6,000 IDs across 190 countries and 15 languages.  The new policy and workflow manager offers industry-specific policy templates and privacy-centric infrastructure to help companies keep up with fast-moving and complex regulatory environments worldwide.  Silicon Valley-based Passbase was launched in 2018 after the founders’ previous app, the crypto wallet Coinance, ran into regulatory hurdles.  “We built Passbase to solve our own problem back in 2018 to allow users to manage their digital identities across different cryptocurrency platforms in a compliant way,” said Passbase CEO and co-founder Dave McGibbon in the press release. “This round of funding brings us one step closer to being the trusted identity solution for Web 3 companies like Coinance.”  Identity verification regulations have proven challenging for cryptocurrency companies.

42421020,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXB2zN,1638984495,Most Influential 2021: Trung Nguyen,"Trung Nguyễn was intrigued by CryptoKitties because it combined something he loved – games – with something he hated – blockchain. It was late 2017 and the initial coin offering (ICO) boom was in full swing. All he saw were bad actors trying to scoop up a lot of money. In his eyes, the entire point of most ICOs was only to raise funds and all the applications were boring. Just fintech stuff. Numbers on a screen.  But Nguyễn couldn’t help feeling curious about the idea of applying blockchain technology to something fun. So he went through the pain of buying ETH (the native token of the Ethereum network), setting up a MetaMask wallet and buying his first Kitty. The game itself was very simple – kind of like playing Nickelodeon’s Neopets with the added novelty of cryptocurrency transactions. Compared with other titles that Nguyễn had loved, including real-time strategy games like Red Alert and Age of Empires, and multiplayer online battle arena games like DotA, CryptoKitties left Nguyễn somewhat underwhelmed.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s Most Influential 2021 list. Matias Romano Aleman’s portrait of Trung Nguyen is up for auction at Foundation, with a portion of the proceeds going to support mental health initiatives through The Giving Block.  His inner engineer, however, was utterly enamored with the complex breeding mechanics underpinning the digital cat craze. CryptoKitties were non-fungible tokens (NFTs) represented as a unique long number, their genetic code, on the Ethereum blockchain. No two Kitties were created equally; each feline was defined by its set of “cattributes,” with unique physical traits and a personality all its own. And when Kitties would “breed” together, their genes would combine so that the offspring would have some mix of those cattributes, based on their lineage.  This presented a fascinating puzzle for Nguyễn, and would eventually inspire him to create Axie Infinity, the breakthrough game that popularized play-to-earn video games and catapulted the entire blockchain gaming sector into the spotlight this year.  Using what limited information he had about the existing Kitties that had been born, and the genes of their parents, Nguyễn began to map the data back to the source code to learn how the breeding algorithm worked and understand the exact probabilities of breeding specific offspring with desirable traits.  “It’s a pretty natural thing with being an engineer, because we see things at a deeper level,” Nguyễn said, explaining how the urge to unravel the mystery is innate within him. “We try to understand everything happening behind the scenes, instead of just seeing the surface.”  Read More: Some Filipino Merchants Prefer Payment in Axie’s SLP  That has long been true of Nguyễn. He represented Vietnam in Yekaterinburg, Russia, at the 2014 International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) – the oldest, largest and most prestigious programming contest in the world. Those who make it to the finals are the Olympic athletes of their field.  Entering those kinds of competitions is Nguyễn’s idea of fun. Something of an academic adrenaline junkie, he revels in the thrill of going up against other brilliant minds to push the limits of his own abilities. The task of reverse-engineering the CryptoKitties genome was just another technical challenge, and once he saw how the technology could be used to create something fun and meaningful, it changed his mind about blockchain technology.  Matias Romano Aleman’s portrait of Trung Nguyen is up for auction at Foundation, with a portion of the proceeds going to support mental health initiatives through The Giving Block.  With the belief that blockchain adoption would come through simple, elegant, decentralized applications, rather than from boring financial software, Nguyễn came up with the idea to build a game of his own – similar to CryptoKitties but more exciting. He reached out to Tu Doan, better known by his pseudonym, Masamune, and pitched the idea.  Years earlier, Nguyễn and Masamune had been co-founders in Lozi, a venture capital-backed social network for food bloggers. Existing media articles say they were childhood friends, which is untrue, but it’s easy to see how the confusion came about. The similarities between their backstories is uncanny. As kids, both were heavily influenced by Japanese culture – they loved Pokémon, devoured manga (Japanese comics, cartoons and graphic novels) such as One Piece and played Asia’s answer to “Magic: The Gathering,” the collectible card game “Yu-Gi-Oh!”  They also loved to make their own games and get their school friends to play them. While Nguyễn drew characters on trading cards, Masamune liked to create board games, gluing his original avatars to Vietnamese coins for the game pieces. Masamune also enjoyed creating creatures out of food, using toothpicks to stick accessories into their potato bodies.  During their Lozi days, the two often discussed their shared passion for video games. As a hardcore gamer, Nguyễn researched the games he played, picking apart the mechanics and rules, while Masamune got into the storylines and graphics. It was then that Masamune told Nguyễn about his dream to build a video game of his own someday. They even entered a hackathon and created a game inspired by the mid-1980s multi-directional shooter on Nintendo Entertainment System, “Battle City.”  Unfortunately, they didn’t win, and they came to the realization that they weren’t particularly good at making games (perhaps not surprising, given neither had a prior background in game development). But what they lacked in experience, they made up for in enthusiasm. The experience left them both with an itch to do more.  As for Nguyễn’s new blockchain game idea, Masamune didn’t quite understand the underlying technology, but he was excited about the prospect of making a game with Nguyễn. He went home from their inaugural executive meeting and sketched the first thing that came to mind: a mix between his pet axolotl (commonly known as the Mexican walking fish) and the food art he used to make as a kid. The result was the first-ever Axie, Puff.  Read More: Former Tron Exec Launches Play-to-Earn ‘Mafia’ Game  For the first few months, while it was just the two of them, Masamune came up with all the original creative ideas and fed them to Nguyễn, who used his math skills to balance the game economics. Eventually, when they started to gain some traction – around 1,000 early supporters and $500,000 in committed funding – Nguyễn suggested Masamune should leave Lozi to work full-time on Axie. Masamune was nervous about quitting his job because he wasn’t doing well financially and had no savings. But Masamune was confident in Nguyễn’s abilities, and he felt the risk was worth it if it meant getting the chance to pursue his lifelong dream.  Talent management  In early 2018, Jeffrey “Jiho” Zirlin went poking around the Discord messaging app looking for something NFT-related he could add to his CV. Before that, he had been working as a recruiter in New York, placing quantitative traders at large hedge funds such as Bridgewater Associates and D.E. Shaw.  “Quants,” as they are known, are the rocket scientists of Wall Street and quite different from traditional investors. More likely to be seen wearing jeans than a suit, they rely on programmed investment strategies rather than on the judgment or opinions of human managers to make decisions. Zirlin’s specialty was to identify those high-functioning souls who had the ability to think with both sides of the brain – equally analytical and methodical as they are creative and artistic.  Read More  Joining the Axie Discord as a player, Zirlin immediately recognized Nguyễn as the quant type. Going back to scour his direct messages, Zirlin saw that he and Nguyễn had already connected, when Zirlin was working as growth lead for a now-defunct project called KittyHats, which sold ERC20 accessory tokens to deck out your CryptoKitties in anything from beanies to Yeezys.  CryptoKitties was one of the first success stories of the crypto era. The collectibles game was responsible for a sixfold increase in the number of daily transactions on the Ethereum blockchain – enough at the time to nearly break the network – and everyone was jumping on the bandwagon.  “Just how people today are asking ‘what will be the next Axie,’ back then we were thinking ‘what will be the next CryptoKitties,’” Zirlin remembers. It was an exciting time of experimentation, with KittyHats and other spinoffs, like KittyRace, a game that allowed CryptoKitties owners to race their pets against others for prize money, helping to germinate the burgeoning NFT industry. Some who worked on those early projects eventually took positions at future success stories such as OpenSea in New York and Dapper Labs in Vancouver, British Columbia.  Zirlin could have looked for work in the U.S., but he opted to relocate to Vietnam. That flips the script on the typical migrant narrative. Despite the higher costs of living, the cultural differences, language barriers and complex visa requirements, it’s usually the Vietnamese who leave home in search of life-changing opportunities abroad.  Today, the Vietnamese diaspora is the fourth-largest Asian immigrant group, and every year, many more leave the country to establish life in a more developed nation. In 2019 alone, Vietnam deployed more than 150,000 migrant workers. It’s a particularly popular path for young and well-educated professionals, with the brain drain making it increasingly difficult for Vietnamese companies to fill their top roles.  “Something special must be happening when you’ve got a guy who convinces an American and a Norwegian to drop everything and go to Vietnam,” said Zirlin, nostalgically, chatting with me via Zoom from his parents’ home in New York. He hasn’t seen Trung since February 2020, when he traveled outside Vietnam for Lunar New Year, and then COVID-19 meant he couldn’t get back into the country. But for the first two years of Sky Mavis, the company behind Axie, Zirlin shared an apartment in Ho Chi Minh City with co-founders Masamune and Aleksander Larsen.  For Larsen, who left his girlfriend behind in Norway and quit a good job building a “big and exciting space game” to go live in Vietnam and work on “a little pet game,” he remembers how awkward it was when Nguyễn came to collect him from the airport. Having collaborated exclusively online, meeting in real life was a bit weird.  They made small talk in the car and Nguyễn dropped Larsen at his hotel. Exhausted after the long haul flight and looking forward to a nap, Larsen went to take a shower. When he came out from the bathroom, Nguyễn was sitting there on the hotel bed, fully consumed by his laptop, coding. Larsen says it felt like he had stepped onto the set of a movie about a startup; the scene where they flashback to the scrappy beginnings of a world-changing success story to introduce the trope of the prodigious programmer, laser-focused on his mission. At that moment, Larsen knew he’d made the right decision.  Today, they have a team of 87 people around the world, with at least 60 of them based in Vietnam, working on multiple projects, including the game itself, an Ethereum-based sidechain called Ronin, a mobile wallet and a decentralized exchange called Katana. But back in those early days, Nguyễn did most of the coding and his do-it-yourself attitude came to shape Sky Mavis’ fundamental development principles. Anything that failed to meet his standards, he would say: We can build it better.  Case in point: Up until early 2020, Sky Mavis had been building Axie on the Loom Network, a scaling tool for Ethereum that became a popular platform for blockchain-based games that needed higher processing speeds and lower fees. But when Loom shifted to focus on enterprise use cases, closed down its public dapp (decentralized application) services and changed its architecture, Sky Mavis chose to abandon it in favor of building its own sidechain.  Their peers probably wondered why Sky Mavis would waste time building its own blockchain, when the founders could have quite easily used something that already existed. But Nguyễn wasn’t convinced that the existing sidechains and layer 2 platforms were the right fit for Axie. As for optimistic rollups or zk-rollups (another type of scaling tool), he was adamant that their launch would be delayed, and anyway, it would take too long for them to mature and achieve adoption. Ultimately, he was right about the rollups, and if Sky Mavis had waited, it wouldn’t have been able to provide the smooth and playable user experience for Axie gamers that Ronin has become known for.  The Ronin launch was a pivotal moment for the entire NFT gaming market and the key catalyst for Axie Infinity’s explosive growth from May to June, as daily active users reached 252,000 from just 38,000 at the end of April, according to Delphi Digital research data. The game is now approaching 3 million daily active users, with Ronin’s transaction volume at roughly four times the number of daily transactions of the Ethereum blockchain.  Ronin’s unveiling was a shining example of Nguyễn’s insatiable pursuit of excellence and a gutsy signal to the rest of the Web 3 world that Sky Mavis was thinking big.  Better than best  “The Last Dance” is a documentary series on Netflix that follows Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls as they went for their sixth National Basketball Association title in eight seasons. Considered by some to be the greatest basketball player of all time, Jordan was known for his unrelenting work ethic and competitive streak. Supremely dedicated and insatiably ambitious, he exhibited a strong desire to learn and continually become a better player throughout his career, famously pledging to his coach: “Nobody will ever work as hard as I work.”  When Larsen watched the documentary, he had a sense of déjà vu. Like Jordan, Nguyễn expects his team to push themselves, perform better, play to his standards and put in the same effort that he does.  Team members attest that Nguyễn is a stickler for quality with acute attention to detail. He works the hardest out of any of them, they say, has the highest expectations and implements near-impossible standards. For the first full year, all staff were contracted to work six days a week, Monday through to Saturday. His strictness strikes fear into some staff, but he does it to better the whole group. He’s as hard on himself as he is on others.  “It is the common goal of both people. Nguyễn wants your product to be great and you want it too,” explains Viet Anh (Andy) Ho, co-founder and chief technology officer of Sky Mavis. “But his standard may be higher than yours, so you develop the sense that you need to adjust your standard. You need to level up your own expectations.”  “He’s definitely a driving force for perfection, and sometimes you need that kind of leader,” Larsen says. “He’s kicked my ass several times. And if he’s failing, I can kick his ass too. That’s the level of competency and execution that we expect from each other.”  Adding to his tough exterior, Nguyễn is something of an enigma, fitting the stereotype of the introverted, reclusive genius. He rarely takes interviews, doesn’t interact much with investors, and leaves Zirlin and Larsen to handle external partners, such as Delphi Digital, the New York-based consulting firm responsible for Axie’s dual-token system; Smooth Love Potion (SLP), a utility token with unlimited supply, and Axie Infinity Shards (AXS), a governance token, designed to better incentivize community participants and stabilize the game’s economy.  See also: GameFi: How to Earn Crypto Playing Games Online  Nguyễn is allergic to distraction and believes in division of labor, which is why Sky Mavis has five co-founders. For outward-facing matters, the energetic Zirlin is devoted to community and the buttoned-down Larsen is in charge of fundraising and investor relations, while Nguyễn, Ho and Masamune handle internal operations in Vietnam.  Up until mid-2018, however, Nguyễn had to be more hands-on. He did the vast majority of the coding, product and user experience design, quality assurance and deployments. He gave feedback on artwork and was building community too; if you know someone who can remember the time when Nguyễn was in Discord every day, answering every question, you know that person is an OG (original gangster).  Times were tough then. Money was running out, the co-founders didn’t pay themselves for a while in 2018, and the company almost didn’t make it. A pre-sale of Axie creatures as well as a land sale raised much needed capital for the fledgling startup, allowing Sky Mavis to sell NFT pieces of the game to its community members to fund development. A $1.5 million seed round announced in early 2019 that was led by Animoca Brands helped, too. But before that, Sky Mavis was receiving stink bids to buy 50% of the company for $1 million.  “We never stopped building,” Zirlin said. “There are people on the team who have worked every single day since 2018 with no breaks.”  While tough, Nguyễn emphasizes fairness and approaches problems with an analytical mindset, his colleagues say. Faced with a challenge, he requires his colleagues to develop a mental model to communicate and defend their rationale for the proposed course of action. That way, others can better understand the issue, interrogate it and contribute their ideas. Nguyễn leads by example in doing that, which is particularly important when he’s giving feedback on a subject seemingly outside of his wheelhouse – which he does. A lot.  “The decision-making process is always like that,” says Andy (Viet Anh Ho). “So when Nguyễn makes some decision, we understand why, and we understand there is some theory and strong foundations backing that decision.”  In the case of failure, the goal is to determine why it happened and how the experience can help the team to do better next time. That is a typical growth mindset. People with a growth mindset enjoy challenges, strive to learn and consistently see the potential to develop new skills, studies have shown.  Gifted  Every three years (not counting pandemic-related disruptions to the usual schedule), the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) conducts an exam that pits teenagers against each other in reading, mathematics and science. Typically, the results are unsurprising – those in richer countries do well, while those in poorer countries do poorly.  Vietnam, however, is an exception. It is the only low-income country in the world to compete at the same level as rich countries on international academic tests.  Often pointed to as a case study for effective policy, Vietnam has produced an entire generation of high performers. And for especially talented students, a cherry-picking system is designed to escalate them into high schools for the gifted. The competition to get into those selective schools is fierce, with thousands sitting through grueling entrance exams in the hope of winning a seat. Students sacrifice sleep to meet the demands of their study regimen and parents shell out money for tutoring. For some kids, the pressure to succeed is so overwhelming that they contemplate suicide.  Of all those coveted schools in Vietnam, Nguyễn attended the best of the best. Founded by a group of renowned Vietnamese mathematicians in 1965, the High School for Gifted Students under the Hanoi University of Science was originally established at a temporary war-time evacuation location. While North Vietnam was occupied by American troops, most educational institutions in the country were shut down for years, but the Vietnamese Mathematical Society continued to support research. It dug trenches next to makeshift classrooms, in case of attack.  The school now has a 5% acceptance rate, and its graduates go on to attend the most prestigious universities in Vietnam and abroad. Famous alumni include Professor Ngô Bảo Châu at the University of Chicago – the first Vietnamese recipient of the Fields Medal, which is generally known as the Nobel Prize of Mathematics.  Some students would sacrifice their right arm to attend the school, but Trung shrugs it off. He could have gone to any school he wanted, but he picked that one because it offered rooms for board on campus and was the farthest away from home. The idea of living far away was immensely appealing; home life was strict and he wanted to travel so that he could do things more freely. “Living a normal life is not interesting to me, it’s kind of boring” says Nguyễn, who struggled to talk to his parents about how he yearned to explore, come up with ideas and experiment. “Being a little rebellious is necessary because it helps you understand yourself more,” he says.  While his peers were sweating bucket loads, Nguyễn did little to prepare for his entrance exam. At school, he says he spent time during “flunked classes” to play video games with friends instead. Nguyễn’s teachers would call home to report his nonconformity, much to the dismay of his parents, though he wasn’t exactly a truant – it was the accelerated curriculum that couldn’t keep up with Nguyễn.  Meet me in the metaverse  Andy Ho, Sky Mavis’ fifth and final co-founder, joined Sky Mavis as CTO in August 2018. While he was the last to join the co-founding team, he had known Trung the longest. Well before the word “metaverse” became a buzzword, the two were teaming together to enter contests online and battle academic opponents around the world.  Those virtual contests were excellent practice to enhance their skills when preparing for elite school-level competitions, such as the National Olympiads. They were also an escape for unusually gifted and talented teenagers like Nguyễn and Ho, who found it difficult to find and connect with other people in their hometown who understood their way of thinking.  After high school, Ho attended university in Singapore, was selected to compete at the 2015 ICPC in Morocco and secured internships in the United States with Google and PayPal. But the quality of life overseas was never as good as Vietnam, and Ho couldn’t help feeling like he wanted to return home someday. He finally made the leap when he saw that Nguyễn was working at the Ho Chi Minh City office of Anduin Transactions, a San Francisco-based company. Anduin paid well and was obviously hiring talented people, and so Ho applied, too.  But little more than two years into the job, Ho found himself confiding in Nguyễn, admitting he was bored with financial software and yearning to do something cooler. Having quit Anduin some months earlier to lead Axie full-time, Trung seized the chance to win Ho onto his team.  See also: Play-to-Earn Is Already the Biggest Star in the Metaverse  “This is just the beginning,” Nguyễn said. “We have the chance to work together and compete against other teams across the world,” he told Ho, pitching the Sky Mavis mission and vision like it was just another programming competition. Ho was sold and he promptly handed in his resignation at Anduin Transactions. That was a pivotal moment for Nguyễn, finally allowing him to feel like he could loosen his grip and let someone else take the lead on developing operations.  Throughout 2021, the team has soared to higher and higher heights, raising a $7.5 million in a Series A funding round that was led by Libertus Capital and $152 million in a Series B round that was led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and Accel Partners. With a truly global strategy from day one – less than 3% of Axie’s 2.6 million daily active users come from inside Vietnam – the company’s premier game has hoovered up players from every corner of the earth in a way that has never before been seen in blockchain-based gaming.  Their success has buoyed Vietnamese industry, too, fueling local job creation and spurring a wave of startup innovation. A slew of new indie game studios are now opening up for business. Cyball, Sipher and Thetan Arena are three examples of blockchain gaming titles to come out of Vietnam in recent times. It’s rumored that some VCs are even setting up funds dedicated to this new breed of Vietnamese-born blockchain games.

42394350,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvc9Dh,1638980073,There Was No ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’ Lawsuit,"A verdict arrived Monday in the civil trial between Craig Wright and the estate of former collaborator Dave Kleiman. A jury found Wright guilty of intellectual property theft and has ordered him to pay $100 million in damages to an entity he founded with Kleiman, W&K Info Defense. At the same time, the jury found Wright not guilty of stealing half of the proceeds of a bitcoin mining business which plaintiffs claimed was a partnership with Kleiman.  But some publications are offering a much different interpretation of the jury’s decision: That they conclusively uncovered the true identity of Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto.  That headline is courtesy, as some of you will guess, of a website called CoinGeek. As evidence for its startling claim, the article quotes a statement made by Wright’s lawyer Andres Rivero after the trial: “The decision reached by the jury today reinforces what we already knew to be the truth: Dr. Craig Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto, the sole creator of Bitcoin and block chain technology.”  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  This statement, made outside of court proceedings by Wright’s own attorney, obviously has nothing to do with the jury’s ruling. The case did not consider the question of Satoshi’s real identity.  CoinGeek has relentlessly engaged in similar distortions of the essence of the trial, stretching back to its pretrial stage years ago. This has turned out to be a masterful strategy, in part because the odd nature of the case meant any verdict could have been spun to Wright’s benefit. Today, a disturbing number of mainstream news outlets are echoing CoinGeek’s version of events, knowingly or not.  CoinGeek has clear financial motives for its campaign. The website is an Ayre Group company, one of several owned by (federally indicted) gambling entrepreneur Calvin Ayre. The Ayre Group is also an investor in nChain, the company that employs Wright as chief scientist. The Ayre Group has also invested in several projects, including HandCash and Taal, built on BSV, the fork of Bitcoin that Wright has pitched as designed according to “Satoshi’s vision.”  Strictly on formal financial grounds, then, CoinGeek is not a news site, but an “owned media” branch of Ayre Group’s nChain/BSV efforts. As a business operation, it serves the same function as, say, the Taco Bell Blog – promoting its parent entity’s services, products and agenda.  To be fair, the Taco Bell Blog appears to have much higher production values and commitment to accuracy than CoinGeek. Take, as a random example that popped up while I was researching this piece, a CoinGeek headline that claims FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried will appear “in court” today. The event in question is testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, which is absolutely not a “court.”  (Ayre also gets his hands dirty as a frequent and vocal defender of Wright and BSV on Twitter, popping up with relentless Reply Guy energy in completely unrelated threads.)     What the trial was really about  Above all, plaintiff Ira Kleiman, suing on behalf of his deceased brother Dave Kleiman, has tried to make a claim against what Wright’s legal team describes as “the Satoshi coins.” That stash of bitcoin (BTC), now worth nearly $50 billion, was supposedly mined as part of Wright and Dave Kleiman’s early collaboration. Wright claims he owns the Satoshi coins, but he has never demonstrated that he holds the private keys that would allow him to move, send or sell them. In fact, some of the wallets have been used to sign messages calling Wright a fraud. Serious analysts suspect that Wright simply picked a list of wallets with big bitcoin balances and claimed to own them.  See also: Craig Wright Called ‘Fraud’ in Message Signed With Bitcoin Addresses He Claims to Own  But Wright’s claims to own $50 billion worth of bitcoin were not in dispute during the trial. Instead, the jury was asked to evaluate email messages and other documents that the plaintiffs argued showed Wright and Dave Kleiman had formed a partnership to work on bitcoin. There was significant ambiguity in those communications, and the jury didn’t find the evidence convincing, rejecting the Kleiman estate’s claim.  But Wright’s control of those coins, which could support his claim to be Satoshi, was simply bracketed for the purpose of the trial – taken as given and not directly interrogated.  Journalistic error  On some level, then, you can’t be too mad when that complexity winds up as a Fox Business headline claiming that Wright “keeps Bitcoins worth $50B” after the trial, or when the Associated Press treats “a cryptocurrency fortune worth tens of billions” as a given, rather than a possible hoax itself.  Some mainstream news outlets have gone much further in mirroring Ayre and CoinGeek’s distorted perspective. Most puzzling is the case of The Wall Street Journal, whose headline yesterday absurdly refers to the trial as the “Satoshi Nakamoto suit.” The story’s first sentence describes a trial that “revolved around the identity of the digital currency’s anonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto,” a claim totally unsupported by the actual content of the proceedings.  This is the second time the Journal has badly flubbed its coverage of the trial. I must admit complete befuddlement at this level of journalistic ineptitude, but you can guess how overjoyed Wright’s supporters must be.  See also: The Trash Moat: When the Media Lies About Crypto | Paul Dylan-Ennis  But no amount of spin can erase the part of the trial that actually did occur. Though it dismissed most of the plaintiff’s claims, the jury found Wright guilty of one count – the theft of intellectual property from his work with Kleiman under the auspices of W&K. The jury ordered Wright to pay $100 million in damages to the company, whose ownership is in dispute.  This finding of theft and deceit by Wright is not incidental or a footnote – it, not the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, was part of the actual substance of the case. Dave Kleiman was a seriously disabled man who appears to have struggled greatly in his final years (in fact, establishing this was part of the defense’s strategy as it tried to prove Kleiman was too sick to actively contribute to his work with Wright). Wright had repeatedly described Kleiman as a very close friend and in other warm terms in private communications, and said he regarded Dave’s death as tragic. Yet the jury ultimately agreed with the plaintiff’s claim that Wright stole Kleiman’s work using, in part, a series of falsified and backdated documents.  The jury ruled not that Wright is “100% Satoshi Nakamoto,” but that he stole from the surviving family of a quadriplegic collaborator who had recently died tragically. Those actions say a great deal about Wright’s character, and should be weighed carefully by anyone who regards him as their champion or ally.",NEGATIVE,BTC | BSV,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | BSV,David Z.

Read more: Kimbal Musk’s Big Green DAO Is a Big Step for Web 3  The organizations are also becoming systemically important to crypto, and by proxy to the wider economy – DAOs manage an overwhelming percentage of DeFi’s $280 billion in total value locked (TVL), as well as a growing percentage of crypto’s nearly $3 trillion aggregate market capitalization. TVL represents the dollar value of all tokens locked in the smart contracts of a decentralized lending project.  Voter turnout  Despite their growing prominence, however, keeping up with the internal workings of DAOs is a notably tricky business.  Discussion forums where proposals are ideated and developed are often cloistered on a separate webpage from a DAO’s voting portal, and much of the most important conversation takes place on Twitter or Discord.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Messari Director of Strategy and Growth Ben O’Neill said that the goal was to create a platform where users can quickly grasp key information.  “A website like CoinMarketCap lets you see the table stakes for a token,” said O’Neill. “We wanted to build a place where you can easily see the table stakes for governance.”  Members of the Messari research team add new proposals to the platform as they’re posted, rank them based on importance and type of proposal, and also gauge how warmly a community has received the proposal. The platform also contains links to both voting portals and the governance forums for the relevant DAOs.  The platform is now live and is currently free to the public, with premium features planned for crypto investment firms looking to better wield their governance tokens.",POSITIVE,없음,FIAT | MARKET | RESEARCH,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/12/08/messari-launches-governance-portal-as-daos-inch-toward-mainstream,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/65d3c67ef450e852a4fe67d7a012c380359adc8b-5058x3793.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42375744,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwANUj,1638979203,BIS Experiment Finds CBDCs to Be Effective in Cross-Border Settlements,"Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) can be effective in carrying out international transactions between financial institutions according to a recently concluded experiment by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), an umbrella group for central banks.  A report published Wednesday said the “Project Jura’' experiment took place over three days in November, and was conducted by the central banks of France and Switzerland alongside the BIS Innovation Hub. Project Jura was announced in June and is part of a series of CBDC experiments launched by the Bank of France in 2020.  The test examined the effectiveness of wholesale CBDCs – a type of digital asset that can be used only by permitted financial institutions – in a range of cross-border settlements. The total cash value of the experiment was €200,000 ($226,000).  According to the report, Jura not only explored how central banks could give non-resident commercial banks access to CBDCs, but also the capabilities of distributed ledger technology in recording these transactions.  “Our main conclusion is that wholesale CBDCs can settle such transactions both safely and efficiently,” said Benoît Cœuré, head of the BIS Innovation Hub, during a press briefing on Wednesday.  Jura is the latest in a series of projects by the BIS Innovation Hub testing possible applications of CBDCs. Earlier this year, Project mCBDC Bridge found wholesale CBDCs could potentially reduce the cost of international transactions while improving settlement speed. Under the mCBDC project, the BIS Innovation Hub center in Hong Kong is working with central banks in Hong Kong, Thailand, China and the United Arab Emirates to build a prototype platform for testing the use of multiple CBDCs for cross-border settlements.  Project Jura also continues the work of the Swiss National Bank’s Project Helvetia, which was set up in 2019 to experiment with settlements involving tokenized assets using wholesale CBDCs. To conduct the latest experiment on wholesale CBDCs, the BIS Innovation Hub and the central banks of Switzerland and France collaborated with private firms like Accenture, Credit Suisse, Natixis and UBS.  The experiment  Starting on Nov. 15, Jura tested the direct transfer of euro and Swiss franc wholesale CBDCs between French and Swiss commercial banks for three days, the report said. The transfers were conducted on a single distributed ledger operated by a third party, according to a press statement issued by the BIS.  It also tested issuing, transferring and redeeming “tokenized euro-denominated French commercial paper” between French and Swiss financial institutions. Commercial paper represents unsecured, short-term debt issued by corporations. Tokenization allows a real asset like commercial paper to be digitally represented on a blockchain or distributed ledger.  According to the report, the tests were conducted using “real-value transactions within the existing legal and regulatory frameworks.” The report emphasized the project was not part of a regulatory sandbox, which added “significant complexity” and realism to the experiment.  On the first day of the experiment, Natixis issued €200,000 in tokenized commercial paper against the wholesale CBDCs and sold it to UBS. In the following days, there were commercial paper transfers between the two Swiss banks, alongside a number of foreign-exchange transactions.  “We wanted to show that we could settle a digital asset and then transfer the proceeds to a different jurisdiction in a real-life environment, abiding by local laws,” Cœuré said.  The report suggests that, based on the experiment, an intraday, wholesale CBDC could have a positive impact on financial stability and limited influence on monetary policy. But Sylvie Goulard, deputy governor of the Bank of France, said that the scale of the experiment was too limited to arrive at broader conclusions.  “We cannot pretend that what we did with €200,000 and a certain type of settlement can be extrapolated for everything, but it is a first step,” Goulard said during the briefing.

For the deal, Caret will contribute an initial 206 MW-DC of solar sites in Texas in exchange for $20 million of equity in Caret Decimal.  The solar power site will be built over a 24-month period, and VivoPower said it ultimately expects to spin off Caret Decimal via an initial public offering (IPO).  “Once fully operational, these sites are expected to have 4,398 petahash capacity, a fleet of 33,000 mining rigs, revenue potential of approximately $270 million per annum with an EBITDA margin of approximately 87% based on forecast bitcoin prices,” the company said.

42394004,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bsREsl,1638975606,Most Influential 2021: Elon Musk,"Maybe you think that Elon Musk is a visionary entrepreneur who will save the planet from catastrophe. Maybe you think that Elon Musk is a reckless narcissist. Maybe you’re simply tired of the guy.  But regardless of your personal views of the man, you can’t deny his outsized influence on crypto in 2021 – specifically on the price of bitcoin and dogecoin.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s Most Influential 2021 list. Federico Solmi’s NFT, “The Melancholic Seer,” is currently up for auction on SuperRare. A portion of the proceeds will go to Children & Youth charity.  Elon loves bitcoin! The price soars. Elon thinks that bitcoin is trashing the environment! The price nosedives. The pattern was so glaring that The Washington Post ran an op-ed titled “Cryptocurrency has an Elon Musk problem,” written by CoinDesk’s own Emily Parker, who noted that “in a supposedly decentralized industry meant to be impervious to any single party’s influence, market prices seem to soar or plunge based on the force of one man’s tweets.”  Not only is Elon Musk clearly one of the “most influential” in crypto in 2021 (for better or worse), it’s possible that no one has ever had more direct influence on the price of an asset in all of human history, or maybe since the days of Caesar. By simply tweeting a meme to his 65 million followers, Musk had the power to instantly create hundreds of billions of dollars in market capitalization … or to make it vanish.  Read More: Musk Says He Hopes Rumors He’s in the SEC’s DOGE House Are True  As some on Twitter observed over the summer, the back-and-forth felt like a game of “He loves me … he loves me not. He loves me … he loves me not.”  So does Elon Musk love bitcoin? Or does he love it not? Let’s revisit some highlights of this tortured love affair.  January 29. He loves me. Musk changed his Twitter bio to one simple word: #bitcoin. The price instantly jumped 13%. He then enigmatically tweeted, “In retrospect, it was inevitable.” Just what, exactly, was inevitable? His endorsement of bitcoin? The rise of bitcoin itself? Thanos? No one knew for sure, but it felt like with Musk officially on Team Bitcoin, mainstream adoption was now … inevitable.  February 4. He loves me. “Doge,” Musk tweeted. That’s it. That’s the tweet. (He’s the king of the one-word tweets.) Many, many, many more doge-related tweets would follow, including a meme inspired by “The Lion King,” with Musk as Rafiki and a Shiba Inu as Simba. He posted this after the price of doge had pumped. The caption? “ur welcome.” Now two things are clear. 1) Musk knows what he’s doing it. 2) He’s having a blast doing it.  February 8. He loves me. Tesla reveals that it invested $1.5 billion in bitcoin, which accelerates the trend of “institutional adoption” that would power the bull run. The price of bitcoin jumped roughly $8,000 in one day, then it cracked $50,000 for the first time. Many crypto traders refer to the day as “Elon’s Candle.” You can even buy an Elon’s Candle t-shirt.  March 24. He loves me. The love affair continues. Maybe it’s true love, and maybe Elon and Bitcoin will be together forever and ever and ever. “You can now buy a Tesla with bitcoin,” Musk tweets, providing a nice, declarative, emphatic statement that seemed like a beacon of hope to the crypto world.  April 28. He loves me. As most cryptocurrencies are still in the throes of the bull market, Musk tweets “The Dogefather,” announcing that he will host “Saturday Night Live” because it’s 2021, so of course Elon Musk will host the show. The tweet is tantalizing. Will he promote dogecoin in front of this national audience? The doge community swoons.  May 8. He loves me not. The SNL gig is seen by many as a bust. During Weekend Update, Musk plays a character who says that doge is just a “hustle.”  May 12. He loves me not. In a tweet that gutted the crypto space, Musk pumps the breaks on Tesla accepting bitcoin, citing environmental concerns. “Cryptocurrency is a good idea on many levels, and we believe it has a promising future,” Musk says to his sobbing lover, “but this cannot come at cost of the environment.” The price tumbles. Bitcoin would plunge from $56k to $30k in the next week.  May 13. He loves … doge? Musk announces that he is “Working with doge devs to improve system transaction efficiency. Potentially promising.” So is bitcoin the wife and is doge the new mistress?  May 24. He loves me … maybe? Musk meets with a group of bitcoin miners to discuss how to become more eco-friendly. “Potentially promising,” Musk tweets, and giving a cheeky nod to his doge endorsement. This time the price jump is more modest. It seems the crypto space is building up what Vitalik Buterin describes as an “immune system” to events like Musk’s tweets. As Buterin told CNN, “He’s not going to have this kind of influence forever.”  June 3: He loves me not. Another wrenching tweet. Musk leans into the conceit that inspires this very article, tweeting a breakup meme with the bitcoin logo and a broken heart.  June 13: He hasn’t forgotten me! Musk responds to a tweet accusing him of price manipulation and dumping bitcoin. “This is inaccurate,” Musk tweets. “Tesla only sold ~10% of holdings to confirm BTC could be liquidated easily without moving market.” He adds that “When there’s confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend, Tesla will resume allowing bitcoin transactions.” Instantly the price of bitcoin recovers, bouncing 10% in the next six hours.  See also: Dogecoin: Too Musk Power for One Man | John Mac Ghlionn  July 21: He loves me! He really loves me! In a panel at The B Word Conference, Musk joins Jack Dorsey and Cathie Wood (both bitcoin bulls) for a conversation about cryptocurrency. The crypto space watches breathlessly. Will Elon slam bitcoin? Will he give it his imprimatur? Musk confirms that he does own bitcoin, ether and, of course, dogecoin. “If the price of bitcoin goes down I lose money. I might pump, but I don’t dump,” Musk said in the video. “I definitely do not believe in getting the price high and selling or anything like that. I would like to see bitcoin succeed.” The price of bitcoin immediately jumped … and began the next leg of the bull run that would see it reach its new all-time high of nearly $69,000. [Cue the song “My boyfriend’s back.”]  October 20. He loves me. Musk tweets a meme of a semi-naked couple, in bed, staring at the all-time high of crypto prices. Bitcoin is $69k. Ether is $4,200. Or 69 and 420. You can do the math.  December 2. He loves Doge. This time the action directly involves CoinDesk itself. A report from CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole found that “Ethereum’s high transaction fees have made DeFi inaccessible to small investors.” Well, Elon Musk has a solution, and you can guess what that solution might be. “Doooge,” Musk replied to CoinDesk.  And this is only a partial list – a full chronicling would take 30,000 words.  So does Elon love crypto or not? The affair has been torrid and wild and emotionally draining. But then again, the most passionate romances tend to run hot and cold. We’ll leave things on this note: After his announced breakup with bitcoin, Musk took the time to reply to a saddened, jilted, laser-eye bitcoiner. He gave him a simple message, and perhaps it’s a signal of what’s truly in his heart: “Make up sex is the best tho.”  “The Melancholic Seer,” is currently up for auction on SuperRare.",NEUTRAL,BTC | DOGE,BTC | DOGE | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/12/08/most-influential-2021-elon-musk,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/955a5bd9b39134a5f51b18e271e376486a5a2f5e-1080x1440.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

CEO Alesia Haas (who is also CFO of the Coinbase Global parent company) in a wide-ranging hearing on digital assets and stablecoins today.  Read more: Crypto CEOs Hit Capitol Hill: Here’s What to Expect     2:55 p.m. Final update: The hearing ended after four hours and 49 minutes, clocking in as one of the longer congressional hearings on crypto. Nearly 40 lawmakers asked questions ranging from specifics about stablecoin backing or certain details to broader questions about use cases in the sector.  2:45 p.m. Rep. Jake Auchincloss (D-Mass.) said a “regulation by enforcement” regime is unfair to crypto companies that have to navigate between different regulators, and that he’s willing to work with both Republicans and Democrats in addressing these concerns.  In his view, a primary market regulator working with a private sector self-regulatory organization that can address issues like custody requirements, stablecoin standards and others might make the most sense for the market.  2:25 p.m. Brooks pointed to minimum balance requirements, monthly account maintenance fees and similar requirements as issues that result in underbanked individuals. Stablecoin issuers don’t have these requirements, he told Rep. Bryan Steil (R-Wis.).  Steil also asked if Coinbase has received any further clarity from the Securities and Exchange Commission about why it cannot offer its now-shuttered Lend product. Haas says the exchange has not heard more.  2:15 p.m. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) asked about bitcoin’s energy usage, noting that the crypto industry “currently consumes enough energy to power a small nation.”  Bitcoin mining uses more energy than Argentina, or Google, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft combined, Tlaib said. In response, Dixon noted that there’s different types of consensus mechanisms which use less energy or might be more environmentally-friendly.  Tlaib also pointed to Marathon Digital’s power plant in Montana and Greenidge Generation’s New York plant as examples of how once-shuttered coal plants are being repurposed for crypto uses.  “We all need to focus on minimizing the energy usage,” Dixon says.  2:06 p.m. Todd Phillips, the director of financial regulation at the Center for American Progress, said the Howey test “is clear” in how it’s utilized to define whether something is a security.  “The Howey test says that something is a security if it is ‘a contract, transaction, or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.’ Basically, if someone raises money to write a DeFi app or something similar by issuing governance tokens, it’s a security and subject to SEC regulation. The test is clear, has been used for nearly 80 years, and efforts to obfuscate that fact are made in bad faith,” he said.  2:05 p.m. Rep. Anthony Gonzalez (R-Ohio) criticized Sherman’s characterization that Big Tech and large banks control the digital asset sector before asking Brooks how Web 3 might operate.  2:03 p.m. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), after asking Haas to clarify whether Coinbase engages in proprietary trading, went into detail on the role stablecoins play in the digital asset ecosystem.  “If the cryptocurrency industry hypothetically lost its ability to use stablecoins as a bridge to trade in and out of dollars tomorrow, would that cause a significant shift? It seems it wouldn’t be able to work the way it works currently correct?” she asked.  Allaire says stablecoins are faster than the traditional banking system, giving it its edge: “I think it’s essential.”  1:42 p.m. Rep. David Kustoff (R-Ga.) asked about the securities framework, and specifically what the SEC has provided in terms of clarification. Haas says the SEC has “not yet provided a clear definition,” instead pointing to Howey and Reves as analysis frameworks for crypto startups to evaluate.  1:38 p.m. Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) brings up last year’s unhosted wallet rule, which the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) proposed near the end of the Trump administration. He specifically asks how the transactions that would be involved differ from MoneyGram or Western Union transactions.  Allaire points to the self-custody aspect, meaning the developer of the wallet would not themselves be involved in any transactions.  “What we argued ... what we really need are ways to provide proof of digital identities,” Allaire said.  1:30 p.m. Rep. Ted Budd (R-N.C.) says he’s concerned about the “nanny state” implementing too many rules for crypto, and asks Brooks about the U.S. regime.  Brooks says the U.S. is unique in having a fragmented regulatory system for banks, and recommends that the U.S. use its existing regulators to apply current rules to crypto, rather than look to have a single regulator oversee the entire industry.  1:27 p.m. Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) asked about exchanges’ cybersecurity practices, as well as the PWG report on stablecoin issuers becoming banks. Bankman-Fried noted the use of practices such as 2-factor authentication and the exchange’s work with law enforcement.  Gottheimer said he’s working on a bill to implement some of the PWG’s recommendations, but wants input on the pros and cons of different models for implementation.  1:23 p.m. Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) (who isn’t on the committee) sent a statement out commending the Financial Services Committee for holding today’s hearing and mentioning his bill addressing crypto regulation.  “My comprehensive digital asset legislation is an excellent starting point for those efforts. I look forward to continued conversations with Chair Waters and other members of the Committee on how Congress can incorporate digital assets into regulatory frameworks, a need that both industry and regulators emphasize more and more all the time,” he said.  1:12 p.m. Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.), after a few comments on data collection practices, asks if blockchain can enhance data protections.  Brooks, reiterating a point he made earlier, said blockchains provide transparency. In previous cybersecurity breaches, such as Target or Equifax, people didn’t learn the full scope of the breaches until weeks or months after they happened. In Brooks’ view, a blockchain can provide transparency if a similar situation happens.  1:04 p.m. “The powers in our society” have spent millions on crypto, Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) says, pointing to major banks that are getting into crypto.  “If you wonder about where the power is, [Facebook CEO Mark] Zuckerberg had to come out here and sit there. Brian Armstrong sent his number two. And Tether didn’t bother to show up at all,” he says in warning regulators not to wait for legislation to begin regulating.  12:59 p.m. Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) leads Bankman-Fried down a line of questioning to establish what sort of protections the exchange provides for its users, before saying he was “confused” about how the SEC allowed a bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund to launch, but not a spot ETF.  12:52 p.m. Rep. Bill Foster (D-Ill.) asks if any of the witnesses would have an objection to “controlled anonymity” within a digital currency, meaning a court could de-anonymize an account for illicit activity (none of the witnesses objected).  12:40 p.m. Rep. Al Lawson (D-Fla.) is asking about the broker provision in the bipartisan infrastructure law, which Dixon responds to by noting that some entities might not have the requisite information to comply should they be classified as brokers.  12:16 p.m. Rep. Sean Casten (D-Ill.) jokes about how we can have an entire hearing on stablecoins and other issues, but asks whether Allaire supports the recommendations from the President’s Working Group report on stablecoins.  “I support a number of things, but not uniformly. I think there are a number of challenges in the report,” Allaire says. His first question is “what form” the federal charter for a stablecoin issuer would take.  Other details need clarification as well, he says.  12:08 p.m. Rep. Juan Vargas (D-Calif.) is asking about digital dollars: “We have a digital dollar ... it’s fiat.” He ran out of time before he could complete the question but he’s essentially asking what the argument for a blockchain-based digital dollar is as opposed to a digitized fiat dollar, such as what we already have now.  11:59 a.m. Brooks used the Motion Picture Association’s rating system for movies to explain the Crypto Rating Council, saying some digital assets had an “R rating” and some had a “PG rating.”  11:57 a.m. Nick Anthony, manager at the Cato Institute’s Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives, says “It’s important to recognize that while Chairwoman Waters called attention to the environmental costs of cryptocurrencies, she also followed this note by acknowledging the benefits that the technology offers – a key element that many critics omit. It may be a subtle change, but this acknowledgment might be the start of a long-needed change in the conversation.”  11:54 a.m. Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer (R-Mo.) asked about how platforms might control users, pointing to Novi specifically – social media companies already control users on their platforms even if the internet itself is broader than that, he noted.  11:45 a.m. Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.) asks about global coordination of regulation in crypto, and what U.S. policymakers can do here.  11:37 a.m. Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas) asked how exchanges identify fraud and mitigate risk.  Coinbase’s Haas says the exchange assesses assets from technology and risk perspectives before listing them.  11:30 a.m. Matt Homer, executive in residence at Nyca Partners and former executive deputy superintendent at the New York Department of Financial Services, says “Testimony is making it clear that crypto is already regulated. Focus should be on gaps and creating level playing field.”  11:20 a.m. Rep. Nydia Velazquez (D-N.Y.) asked about stablecoins, specifically asking if Allaire and Cascarilla would support a federal mandatory reporting requirement (both said yes).  11:10 a.m. Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) is asking Haas about a cyberattack earlier this year that led to a hot wallet losing funds.  Haas says not a lot of funds were at risk, and Coinbase reimbursed any impacted customers. Maloney followed up by asking if this sort of protection is Coinbase-specific or something all platforms offer (it was Coinbase specific).  Maloney also asked about ransomware, as chair of the House Oversight Committee.  11:05 a.m. From Andreessen Horowitz policy lead Tomicah Tilleman: “This is the first time Members of Congress are using the platform of a full committee hearing to highlight that Web 3 is the future of the internet. It’s a historic inflection point in the national conversation around decentralized tech. You’re also seeing members acknowledge the potential of web3 platforms to solve a lot of problems they care about, including remittances and financial inclusion. The tone so far from all participants has been reasonable and constructive. So far, so good.”  11:02 a.m. McHenry follows up with a question about Web 3 to Brooks, who then outlines how he defines the differences between Web 1 (sites publishing content), Web 2 (people being able to publish content) and Web 3.  10:59 a.m. Waters kicks things off with a pointed comment to Cascarilla: “I’m a bit concerned about your company” because of the Novi pilot project she said. She asks how Facebook can be trusted not to expand beyond its pilot given Facebook’s history.  “Novi is Paxos’ customer,” Cascarilla says, adding it’s just like any other customer. He says Paxos conducted its due diligence into the Facebook (now Meta) subsidiary.  In response to a followup, Cascarilla says Novi itself would be best placed to answer questions about how it might expand this pilot.  10:50 a.m. Coinbase Inc CEO/Coinbase Global CFO Alesia Haas says her firm holds 12% of the world’s crypto on its platform.  10:47 a.m. Everyone’s talking about financial inclusion today.  10:45 a.m. Stellar CEO Denelle Dixon actually discussed some of the other use cases, pointing to the Stellar Development Foundation’s work with MoneyGram for a remittance tool as an example.  10:43 a.m. Paxos CEO Charles Cascarilla also pointed to the role cryptocurrencies/stablecoins can play in banking underbanked individuals. It’s been a bit of a theme so far today. I have to imagine a few members might have questions about the “how” here.  10:37 a.m. Brooks made the claim that the current regulatory regime is driving legitimate activity offshore: “Can anyone explain ... why Fidelity Investments, one of America’s best-known investment advisors, had to go to Canada to offer a bitcoin ETF?”  He pointed to other activities legal in locations like Germany to further emphasize this point.  10:35 a.m. Bitfury Group CEO Brian Brooks (former Binance US CEO/former Acting Comptroller of the Currency) briefly outlined Bitfury’s business (i.e., mining) before pivoting to what he sees as the key issues in the regulation conversation. He quoted from his written testimony directly here, asking about securities enforcement without allowing registration, treating stablecoin issuers as banks but not granting them bank charters, etc.  10:32 a.m. FTX CEO and founder Sam Bankman-Fried emphasized the role he sees cryptocurrencies playing in providing financial services to un/underbanked individuals, pointing to the stated goal of disintermediation in his remarks.  10:30 a.m. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire summarized his written remarks in his opening testimony: He briefly summarized the history of stablecoins and the role they can play in financial services. He pointed to what Circle in particular has been doing, including a mention of USDC’s backing.  10:16 a.m. And yes, crypto twitter got a shoutout lol  10:15 a.m. Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the ranking Republican member, calls 2021 “the year of cryptocurrency,” adds that much of the sector is already regulated, even if the regulations that exist are “clunky.” He warns against overregulating the industry in his opening statement.  10:14 a.m. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), the committee chair, kicked off the hearing with “today’s hearing is part of this Committee’s ongoing [effort]” to understand crypto and the issues around it. Much of her opening statement resembled the hearing memo, outlining both what FSC has done this year on crypto as well as some of the key issues to be discussed.  10:02 a.m. While we wait for this hearing to get started, here’s a quick preview I wrote up for CoinDesk. The House Financial Services Committee also published a memo outlining the broad focus for today, which is worth a look as well.  10:00 a.m. The House Financial Services Committee is meeting to discuss crypto trading platforms and stablecoins today.

42394006,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bsRF89,1638974985,Most Influential 2021: Jack Mallers,"Bitcoiners don’t cry.  If anything, the most committed and focused Bitcoin advocates are usually stereotyped as merciless trolls and self-satisfied jerks, whether they’re making fun of BTC skeptic Peter Schiff or other cryptocurrencies. So it is truly exceptional that the biggest Bitcoin announcement in a year full of them – the adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador – was made through a veil of overwhelmed tears.  Jack Mallers, the elfin CEO of bitcoin payments app Strike, was the man with the waterworks. Mallers had helped shepherd the initiative to the finish line over months of meetings with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele. By the time he was on stage at Bitcoin Miami in June, the weight of it all caught up with him.  This post is part of CoinDesk’s Most Influential 2021 series. The video NFT by Norman & Robness is available at SuperRare.  “That moment to me was way bigger than myself,” he says, “Or [even] the country of El Salvador. In my opinion, this is one of the bigger developments in economics and emerging markets in the last 250 years. It’s the most important thing I’ve ever been a part of, and likely ever will be.” (Some quotes from our conversation have been edited for clarity and length.)  “[And] to see my dad in the front row was really special. He told me I was making him proud, making the family proud.” Mallers is the third generation of his family to work in finance – his grandfather was chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade.  Bid on the video NFT of Jack Mallers and Nayib Bukele by Norman & Robness at SuperRare.  That pedigree makes Mallers’ professed humility a bit more surprising. To hear him tell it, he helped midwife a financial revolution more or less by chance. “A few years ago, no one cared what I really had to say. I’m a pleb. Forever a pleb, always will be a pleb. I don’t think of myself as an influencer whatsoever.”  The humility is fair in at least one crucial sense: Despite long weeks spent talking to Bukele and his inner circle, and even though Strike is marketing its payments app there, El Salvador’s big move isn’t a Strike project.  “I was advising the government,” says Mallers, “And that was it. Strike has a headquarters in San Salvador, and all of our [user] metrics and cohorts are growing at a shocking rate … and we’re very excited to roll out across Latin America and other emerging markets.  “But neither I nor my company is representative of what’s going on there, and that’s tremendously important. The whole concept is that you don’t need any central [provider]. If Colombia were to launch, you don’t need a government wallet, you don’t need a Strike.”  Read more: The Lightning Network Is Going to Change How You Think About Bitcoin - Jeff Wilser  That’s just scratching the surface of why El Salvador’s adoption of Bitcoin as financial infrastructure is so transformational. There is, of course, the headline advantage of quick and cheap cross-border payments – remittances from emigrants make up a large portion of El Salvador’s gross domestic product, and a bitcoin-based system could drastically reduce fees relative to the likes of Western Union. And moving money entirely on their phones may keep Salvadorans safer than older methods.  But the stakes are even larger than that. When he really gets going on the significance of El Salvador’s transformation, Mallers face tightens and his gaze goes flat. No longer the bubbly, humble goofball, he’s now the ferocious bitcoiner of Christine Lagarde’s worst nightmares.  “Monetary expansion from central banks puts emerging markets, including El Salvador, at tremendous risk. Now you have an emerging market that can opt out of their relationship and reliance on a central bank or an institution like the IMF (International Monetary Fund) and … find opportunity in a separate monetary system that lives and is defended within a distributed network.”  The moment is at least as big for Bitcoin as it is for El Salvador – one of a series of high-profile validations of the system that defined 2021. Despite some hiccups with the rollout of El Salvador’s Chivo wallet, Mallers sees El Salvador’s policy as a massive vindication for Satoshi Nakamoto’s vision. (Nakamoto is the anonymous founder or founders of Bitcoin.)  “First and foremost, bitcoin works,” Mallers says. “I’ve been around long enough where that wasn’t necessarily always [clear]. And going forward, what it means is – how do you price that? How do you price the fact that there is a monetary policy, a monetary asset, a monetary energy … that you can rely on, that’s defended by a distributed system?  “It looks like this [Bitcoin] thing is going to work. It doesn’t look like it’s going to zero. It looks like it’s financial acid, and anything it touches, it’s really going to swallow up and just destroy.”  That’s an understandably worrying vision for some in the legacy financial system. The IMF and World Bank in particular have balked at El Salvador’s plan. A forthcoming Salvadoran bond backed by bitcoin and bitcoin mining could help the country make an end run around IMF financing, which is often doled out to developing countries with serious strings attached.  Mallers professes confusion at the development banks’ hostility.  Read more: Strike’s Jack Mallers on Fixing the Fiat Problem - Jeff Wilser  “I actually just presented at the IMF, and this is what I told them: The G-20 (group of 20 major economies) and the U.N. (United Nations) have a mandate to lower the cost of remittance and cross-border payments to 5%. And it’s because low-wage workers, immigrants, and refugees are reliant on sending money back home to smaller markets …  “I think that if the U.N. and the G-20 really want to lower remitting costs, want to improve financial inclusion, want to build stability in financial markets, my pitch to them is, you should take a look at bitcoin, and stop trying to mandate [lower prices] for Western Union.  “It’s an opt-in system, and El Salvador is using it to improve the quality of their [citizens’] lives. So what? If it was a hammer or a nail, or it’s bitcoin, it’s just a tool. If you have a problem with people improving their lives and their citizens’ lives, then I have a problem with you. Then I’d really question your motives.”  But that’s about as negative as Mallers is willing to get. “We should be celebrating, because humans have invented the best financial tool in our history, and it’s an exciting time to be alive and use it,” he says.  Of course, Mallers’ role in that evolution does give his company a leg up on the future, and Strike is prepared to seize it. “We’re going to launch in a lot of emerging markets. And I think there are also a lot of developed market [opportunities] … We’re trying to build the best consumer experience in the world. Step by step, more countries, more features, more products. We’re just getting started.  “I just feel lucky to be alive and capable of building things right now,” Mallers says, his eyes sparkling. “It’s a unique time for our species.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,David Z.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency was trading above $51,000 on Tuesday and began to drop below the $50,000 mark at around 10:30 a.m. coordinated universal time (UTC). As of press time, bitcoin (BTC) was changing hands around $49,645.  Ether (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down 3% in the last 24 hours.  European stock markets wavered after witnessing a sharp rise on Tuesday as investors grew more cautiously optimistic after studies showed vaccines provide partial shield against the omicron variant.  Laurent Kssis, a crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) expert and director of CEC Capital, a crypto trading advisory firm, said that both bitcoin and ether remain vulnerable to price pullbacks, fueled by leverage washouts. According to the data site Coinglass, some $187 million of crypto trading positions were liquidated over the past 24 hours.  “This is skewed to long liquidations, which will inevitably put downward pressure on BTC,” said Kssis.  Glassnode data shows that support failed to hold and triggered a full wave of liquidations as the lower price was hit each time:  Looking forward over a longer-term horizon, bitcoin fundamentals remain “extremely strong,” and adoption and development trends are “undeniably bullish,” said Jason Deane, analyst at Quantum Economics.  He attributes the recent lack of market momentum to sentiment and technical trading more than anything else. “It may well stay that way until enough momentum is achieved in either direction,” said Deane.  Over the last two weeks, bitcoin short momentum volume has increased two times over that of longs, according to Stack Funds’ weekly report.  “Added pressures such as regulatory scrutiny, profit-takings and weaker accumulation trend have all played a part in this,” wrote Lennard Neo, head of research at Stack Funds.  Ecoinmetrics data shows that similar drawdowns in magnitude and duration were seen earlier this year that resulted in 20%-40% declines, and after each time, the market recovered and extended to new highs.

It closed before news broke Tuesday that Enso Finance, a “social trading” competitor, would fork Index Coop and other decentralized finance (DeFi) projects’ code and then incentivize its users to move their assets over.  Success would give Enso Finance a slice of Index Coop’s nearly $500 million pie. Exchange-traded fund-like tokens such as the DeFi Pulse Index, which give its holders broad exposure to DeFi tokens’ price actions, have helped the protocol rack up over $2 million in lifetime fees.  Core contributors at the DAO told CoinDesk they aren’t worried; Index Coop has fended off such “vampire attacks” before, like In April when BasketDAO attacked.  “For the week or two that it was happening, we saw a drop with like 300 users, but I mean, we add probably 400 users in a week. It was kind of just a little blip,” core contributor Simon Judd told CoinDesk.  Read more: DeFi Index Project to Launch With Vampire Attack on Index Coop, Others  Across its metaverse, leveraged ETH and leveraged BTC strategies, Index Coop’s family of “funds” hold nearly $420 million in crypto assets. That figure has occasionally eclipsed $500 million but the recent market sell-off pushed it down.  “We’re adding 200, 300, 400, 500 people holding our indexes. And that’s happening regardless of what’s happening in the market,” Judd told CoinDesk. He said that over 31,000 wallets are currently plugged in.  The growth highlights budding demand for crypto-native investment products that mimic traditional vehicles. Passively managed by market conditions, Index Coop’s crypto funds generate $17,222 in daily fees, Judd said.  See also: Index Coop, Bankless DAO Team Up to Launch New Crypto Index  “In traditional markets passive products make up an outsized share of holdings for investors seeking diversified, no-frills exposure with low fees; we believe a similar trend will take place for crypto,” Anandamoy Roychowdhary, principal at Sequoia India, said in a statement.

42394334,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvc8JH,1638970578,Bitcoin’s Lost Coins Are Worth the Price,"The New Yorker recently published a profile about early bitcoin user James Howells, who mined about 7,500 BTC using his gaming computer in 2009, only to discard the hard drive storing his private keys while cleaning his home office. That trove, worth today approximately $383 million, is likely sitting in a dump in Newport, Wales.  Howells thinks he has a decent chance of recovering the hard drive. He’s worked to raise £5 million ($6.6 million) to finance an excavation. That project would dig up and sort through 40,000 tons of household waste, buried for nearly a decade. But the Newport government thinks it’s too dangerous and isn’t worth the cost.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The story is familiar enough: There are plenty of tragic tales about people throwing out their old computers, forgetting passwords or getting hacked. Sometimes people regret spending bitcoin too soon. One South Carolina hypnotist even markets services around helping people recall forgotten private key pairs.  Sad though it may be for Howells, this is simply how bitcoin works. In creating a tamperproof, append-only distributed database, bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto also created a monetary system that would be very hard to hack, censor or dismantle.  Howells told the New Yorker, if it were any other way, if he or anyone else were able to reverse the Bitcoin blockchain to recover lost coins, then so would nefarious actors – like governments or corporations.  Some bitcoin boosters and critics alike say the network will never become a widely adopted payments system without the ability to reverse transactions. Real life is messy – people make mistakes or change their mind. Having that fallback is good for business.  The amount of capital in this industry obscures the relatively simple aims Nakamoto set out to accomplish. A healthier view might be that crypto – admittedly a difficult thing to wrap your head around, let alone use – is a better fit for a small subgroup of sophisticated users. That sounds elitist. But changing bitcoin at its core isn’t crypto; it’s fintech.  See also Crypto Long & Short: Where Fintech Ends and Crypto Begins  On this subject, Nakamoto wrote about irretrievable coins as a “donation to everyone.” The more coins that are permanently taken out of circulation, the more valuable the rest become. Data analytics firm Chainalysis estimates that about a fifth of all coins mined to date (somewhere between 2.78 and 3.79 million) are lost.  Blockchain rollbacks have happened before, and will likely happen again. The version of Ethereum we all know and love is the result of a reimbursement plan for victims of the DAO hack. The issuers of U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins tether and USDC routinely freeze funds. But it will almost, certainly never happen to bitcoin. And that’s its strength.  There’s a price tag, often a painful one, attached to lost coins. But bitcoin’s core principles, of censorship-resistance, of personal responsibility, are invaluable.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/12/08/bitcoins-lost-coins-are-worth-the-price,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3a2130408452e7301d7b9de94075597a8a1c01c8-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

13221785,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=478438,1638968405,Why Shar Pei Is Set To Replace Dogecoin And Shiba Inu,"The popularity of meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu has triggered an influx of meme coins into the crypto space. For starters, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of small projects that have popped up to try to profit off the fame of these tokens. Some have succeeded, most have failed. However, one thing is certain, the Shiba Inu-themed coin market is oversaturated. To this end, there has been the need for new themes to keep the meme coin space afloat. Cats have made their debut in the space as projects try to break away from dog themes. All this really means is that there needs to be a new dog in town and that dog is Shar Pei. What Is Shar Pei? A Shar Pei is a dog breed from southern China that is usually kept as a watchdog or a property guardian. The breed is distinguished by its incredibly wrinkly skin and muscular build. They make for adorable dogs while also being loving companions and guardians. Deviating from the standard Shiba Inu dog breed that the meme coin space is known for, the Shar Pei project has taken on this dog breed to fly on its banner. Shar Pei has stayed as close to the original theme behind the leading meme coins but has found immense success in its differences.

42420839,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYlOX,1638966600,Scaling Ethereum Without Trade-Offs: Inside EIP 4488,"Last week, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin brought forth Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4488, an upgrade that could drive down transaction costs for Ethereum rollups like Arbitrum, Optimism and zkSync. The proposal detailed the immediate steps for pushing gas fees down without sacrificing security, as well as the roadmap for moving forward post-Merge. Here are some of the ideas contained within the proposal:  Layer 2 rollups batch users’ transactions and post them to mainnet via “calldata.” Calldata is defined by OpenZeppelin as “a read-only byte-addressable space where the data parameter of a transaction or call is held.” According to Buterin’s blog post, the upgrade would reduce the cost of posting calldata onto mainnet, further driving down costs for end users.  In their current state, Ethereum block sizes are healthy enough that EIP 4488 combined with other upgrades would not add any significant costs to maintaining a node. Keeping block size small is essential for maintaining decentralization and ensuring anybody can run a node.  Increasing data space alone would put strain on node operators, as storing the entire history of the network would be too large for average computers. A complementing proposal to offload a node’s responsibility of storing blocks one year or older would solve this issue.  By socializing gas costs across multiple transactions, Optimistic rollups have already driven transaction fees down 3-8x, and ZK-rollups are 40-100x cheaper than Ethereum’s base layer. Buterin expects increasing data space could “decrease costs for rollups by ~5x.”  Buterin hinted that rollups will likely be the short-, medium- and long-term solution to scaling Ethereum. Introducing sharding to Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network will further allow the blockchain to scale and make transactions cheaper for layer 2 rollups.  Read more about EIP 4488 here.  Welcome to another edition of Valid Points.  Pulse check  The following is an overview of network activity on the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain over the past week. For more information about the metrics featured in this section, check out our 101 explainer on Eth 2.0 metrics.  Disclaimer: All profits made from CoinDesk’s Eth 2.0 staking venture will be donated to a charity of the company’s choosing once transfers are enabled on the network.  Validated takes  Securitize aims to solve know-your-customer (KYC) compliance rules for wallets interacting with Aave Arc, an institutional arm of the decentralized finance (DeFi) lending giant. BACKGROUND: Aave Arc is a subsection of Aave that allows whitelisted institutions to utilize high liquidity lending pools in a regulated manner. Securitize is looking to match institutions with a specific wallet address, which would otherwise be anonymous.  Centralized exchange Bitmart was exploited for $196 million via a private key hack. BACKGROUND: While DeFi is often scrutinized for smart contract risks and recurring exploits, centralized exchanges prove they face similar challenges. Users will be refunded in this case, as Bitmart will compensate those affected by the hack. Personal and institutional private key security continues to be a weak point for crypto adoption.  Binance and Animoca Brands teamed up to invest $200 million in gaming applications built on Binance Smart Chain. BACKGROUND: Metaverse and blockchain gaming applications have gained significant traction during the second stages of the NFT craze. Alternative layer 1s and Ethereum layer 2s are massively incentivizing game founders with seed investments and native token rewards, looking to establish the first decentralized gaming ecosystem.  Internal issues at Sushi caused core members to step down and created community-wide drama. BACKGROUND: Token launches have proven to be an efficient way of bootstrapping a protocol, but longevity issues can arise down the road. The current model of most DeFi products pays a significant portion of revenue to liquidity providers and token stakers, creating treasury issues later on. Sushi has struggled to retain talent and align incentives with token holders as core team members claim they are underpaid.

Stump, a commissioner of the derivative market watchdog, said that it is commonplace for the regulator to bring action against a firm without giving them the guidance necessary to comply with the rules concerned.  “What I discourage here at the CFTC is bringing enforcement actions without giving [crypto firms] the tools they need to be compliant,” she said.  As an example of enforcement coming before proper rule making, Stump cited the $1.25 million fine given to crypto exchange Kraken by the CFTC for not registering as a futures broker.  “I would have preferred that we would not have brought those types of cases until we had better defined how they might achieve compliance,” she added.  The points Stump raised represent the ongoing lack of clarity for crypto firms from U.S. regulators particularly given the blurred lines between the purviews of the CFTC and the markets regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

42424104,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2khPh,1638950400,‘DeFi 2.0’ Platform JellyFi Raises $4.4M Seed Round,"JellyFi, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform specializing in under-collateralized crypto loans, has raised $4.4 million in a seed funding round led by Lemniscap.  Also included in the round were ParaFi Capital, Tioga Capital, White Star Capital, DeFiance Capital, True Ventures, Divergence Ventures, AngelDAO, Digital Currency Group and Genesis Trading (both in the same ownership stable as CoinDesk), plus some angel investors.  The funds will be used to support JellyFi’s growth through R&D and key hires, according to a press release, as well as performing multiple audits ahead of the platform going live around February of next year.  Capital-inefficient over-collateralized lending, where a borrower, for example, has to post $15 million in crypto assets to borrow $10 million is how most of the DeFi universe operates today.  “Right now, DeFi is really focused on over-collateralized lending with the biggest protocols like Aave and Compound,” said JellyFi CEO and founder Alexis Masseron, a former ConsenSys engineer. “So it’s a very narrow field and we see the next evolution is under-collateralized lending, part of what we call DeFi 2.0.”  How it works  JellyFi is a kind of a marketplace for credit lines, said Masseron in an interview, where borrowers and lenders are matched based on the most competitive rates discovered by the market. Borrowers pay a small maintenance fee, and lenders whose rates are too high to be matched have their liquidity transferred to DeFi giant Aave, where they earn yield plus the small maintenance fee.  Separate from its seed funding, JellyFi received a grant from its main partner, Aave, to the tune of $70,000 paid in three batches.  “Look at what’s going on in traditional finance; everything is made around under-collateralized loans and there are way too many use cases that can’t happen if you don’t have them,” Masseron said. “So it’s not about whether it’s risky, or whether we should do it or not. We need to do it. There are no other options, and we all know it.”  The financial system requires a credit system, said Roderik van der Graaf, founder at Lemniscap, echoing Masseron’s point.  “The first iteration of DeFi 1.0 was over-collateralization, which works, and it’s kind of cute,” van der Graaf said in an interview. “But you can’t replace finance with over-collateralization. So this is about opening that up and creating wholesale markets of credit.”",POSITIVE,없음,MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/12/08/defi-20-platform-jellyfi-raises-44m-seed-round,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5975fed7209708886f971e3b1e37e13d0cfa6423-7952x5304.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Sadly, despite this massive growth trajectory, the industry has always been one-sided. It&apos;s almost always that only the gaming studios can turn in a profit while users only pay for in-game assets they do not even have ownership of.

All thanks to blockchain and crypto! The Change of Blockchain and Crypto-Powered P2E Games Innovation with blockchain and cryptocurrencies has helped turn gaming into a source of revenue rather than just entertainment for thousands of people. Blockchain-based, play-to-earn online games are allowing users to earn crypto as incentives, and many have attested it as a secondary source of income.

In an attempt to bring rules for Australia’s payment systems up to date, the new regulations will “broaden the definition of services and products that can be regulated,” taking cryptocurrencies and digital assets “out of the shadows” and into a “world-leading” regulatory framework, Frydenberg said in an interview with 7NEWS Australia on Wednesday.  Firms that buy and sell cryptocurrencies will have to be licensed to bring safety and security to users, the treasurer said. The government will also work out a licensing plan for crypto exchanges next year, the Australian Financial Review reported.  The treasury will also be working with the central bank on a digital currency, according to Frydenberg.  In October, an official from the Reserve Bank of Australia said that there is no strong case for a central bank digital currency in Australia, but that the central bank was ramping up its development to stay ahead of global competition.  More than 800,000 Australians own some form of crypto assets, Frydenberg said. That figure is about 3% of the population, much lower than previous estimates based on online surveys.  The treasurer’s proposed regulation will also take aim at “buy now, pay later” services. More than five million accounts for such services exist in Australia, he said.

Wu Blockchain, a Chinese crypto reporter, tweeted that 97,477 ETH was transferred from the cryptocurrency exchanges FTX, Binance and Coinbase to a wallet marked by Nansen as belonging to Three Arrows Capital. Nansen, a blockchain analysis firm, confirmed the data to CoinDesk.  Zhu of Three Arrows responded to the tweet by saying that “100k eth is dust,” and that there’s “more coming.”  Zhu said in a Telegram chat with CoinDesk that the hedge fund is bullish on ETH because the macro environment has become calmer and that “both U.S. and Chinese stock markets are healthy.”  “It now appears like a healthy flush out of leverage after weeks of excess and dispersion,” Zhu said.  “Many overleveraged crypto derivative positions were stopped out,” Zhu added. “Leading up to this, many different coins had gone up substantially and people were asking what’s next constantly.”  The move is especially notable given Zhu’s recent disavowal of Ethereum, claiming “zero newcomers can afford the chain” because of its high transaction fees.

42424097,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2khBh,1638924030,Polygon’s MATIC Token Up 40% Amid Crypto Rebound,"As cryptocurrencies continued to recover Tuesday from last weekend’s massive sell-off, Polygon, an Ethereum scaling product, was among the biggest gainers.  MATIC, the native token of the Polygon blockchain, surged from $1.79 on Monday morning to $2.50 in 24 hours, a nearly 40% gain. At the time of publication, the price dipped to $2.32.  The increase occurred as more users have become aware of Polygon’s lower costs and greater efficiency and scalability. Speculation has also mounted over what the firm has called an “exciting announcement” scheduled for Thursday at Polygon virtual “zk day.”  The event will center around the applications of zk-STARKs and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, a type of cryptography that can verify whether a given statement is true without revealing the data that proves it.  “I think investors are finally waking up to the fact that Polygon is essentially an index fund of Ethereum scaling solutions and the 800-pound gorilla in the [zero-knowledge] space,” Dean Thomas, Polygon’s global head of institutional capital, said.  Polygon is a protocol and framework for building and connecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks, offering an ecosystem with lower transaction costs and faster speeds than Ethereum.  Zero knowledge  ZK-rollups are a technology that helps Ethereum scale without compromising the blockchain’s decentralization and security.  Matter Labs’ zkSync and StarkWare’s StarkNet are both examples of ZK-based Ethereum scaling tools. Both projects also closed $50 million funding rounds in November. ZkSync’s funding round was led by Andreessen Horowitz and StarkNet’s by Sequoia Capital.  In August, Polygon merged with ZK protocol Hermez in a $250 million deal that brought ZK rollup capabilities to Polygon. Polygon followed up in September with a partnership with audit giant Ernst & Young to build Polygon Nightfall, a privacy-focused ZK-rollup geared toward enterprise use.  “[Polygon’s] priority is to help scale Ethereum and ZK is the biggest bet to achieve it,” a spokesperson for Polygon told CoinDesk.  User growth  Over the past several weeks, Polygon has also attracted interest from venture capitalists and institutional investors as Ethereum’s soaring gas fees have sent projects fleeing to cheaper blockchains.  In a newsletter this morning, Polygon reported all-time high network revenue for November and reached over 300,000 active addresses.  Polygon also saw record monthly volume of nearly $60 million on non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea last month.  “We are significantly undervalued by any metric be it daily active users, transaction volume, or number of dapps being built on our platform,” Thomas told CoinDesk.  Earlier this month, decentralized exchange IDEX launched its v3 on Polygon, aiming to combat high fees and failed transactions that have plagued users of Ethereum’s Uniswap platform.  Projects related to NFTs or the metaverse are also moving over to Polygon because of the high minting and transfer costs on Ethereum.  Polygon’s MATIC token is now the 14th-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, with a value of $16.2 billion, according to data from CoinGecko.
