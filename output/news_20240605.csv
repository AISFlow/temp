This thesis is based upon ether’s disruptive ability, progress with the ETF, and VanEck's read of on-chain data.  VanEck has a new price target for ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum protocol: $22,000 by 2030.  That would be a massive jump from current levels of around $3,850.  The global investment firm, which has applied to list an ether exchange-traded fund (ETF), and forecasts that ether ETFs could be larger than their bitcoin counterpart, wrote in a recent report that ether will soar to that lofty level because of Ethereum’s disruptive power and cashflow generated for token holders.  Ethereum is disrupting the finance, banking, payments, marketing, advertising, social, gaming, infrastructure and artificial intelligence sectors, VanEck wrote. The prediction is also based on the expectation ether ETFs will get approved and the company’s ”read of on-chain data.”  ""We anticipate that spot ether ETFs are nearing approval to trade on U.S. stock exchanges,"" according to the report. ""This development would allow financial advisors and institutional investors to hold this unique asset with the security of qualified custodians, and benefit from the pricing and liquidity advantages characteristic of ETFs.""  VanEck wrote that the disruptive power pushing ether to $22,000 is that Ethereum-based technology can offer lower costs, increased efficiency and greater transparency.  According to VanEck’s thesis, this shift threatens to transfer significant market share from traditional financial and tech institutions, which collectively have a $15 trillion total available market, to blockchain-based solutions.  VanEck also notes that the free cash flows from revenue derived by holding ether are set to hit $66 billion by 2030, driving ether's valuation to its projected target.

28988483,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=611567,1717628427,"Analyst Says Get Ready As Dogecoin Enters ‘Expansion Stage’, Can DOGE Reach $12?","Dogecoin is one of the cryptocurrencies getting a lot of interest from analysts recently. With meme coins expected to outperform once again during this bull cycle, crypto analyst Crypto Kinfolk has pointed out where the Dogecoin price could end up as this bull cycle manifests. Dogecoin Enters Expansion Stage In an analysis posted on the TradingView platform, crypto analyst Crypto Kinfolk laid out a possible scenario that could see the Dogecoin price soar from here. Starting out with a brief history, the crypto analyst highlighted how far the meme coin has come since being created back in 2013 as a joke. Also, having such a long history has made it possible for historical analysis to be drawn for the meme coin. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Forecasts A 4,000% XRP Price Run To $30, Here’s When One of these historical analyses is how the price of Dogecoin has performed in previous bull markets. In the last two bull markets, meaning the 2017-2018 and 2020-2021 bull markets, the DOGE price saw massive gains of 21,000% and 50,000%, respectively. Given this, a continuation of this trend could suggest that the meme coin could outperform in another bull market. As Crypto Kinfolk points out, Dogecoin has created a habit of mimicking its performance from the last bull cycle. So if there is a repeat, then this bull cycle could be just as explosive as the last, leading to what the analyst calls “a mind melting bull run.” Can DOGE Price Rise To $12 This Bull Cycle? Pointing to the chart, Crypto Kinfolk explains that Dogecoin has finally completed its bear market trend, which is now giving way for recovery. More importantly, the meme coin is breaking out of accumulation, something that is historically bullish for price. As a result of this, the crypto analyst believes that the DOGE price has now entered an “expansion stage.” In this expansion stage, the meme coin is expected to outperform, and even if it replicates just a small percentage of its previous bull runs, its price could quickly rise to unprecedented levels. The first target put forward by the analyst in this stage is $4.20. Hitting this first target would mean an almost 2,500% increase from its current price level of $0.1626 at the time of writing. However, the analyst does not stop there, expecting further outperformance from the meme coin. The second target is a 6,100% increase to hit the $10.10 level. Last but not least, the third target was placed at $12, representing an expected 7,200% increase in price.

Juan Tacuri, 46, of Florida, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in the Southern District of New York (SDNY), a charge which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Tacuri also agreed to forfeit nearly $4 million back to his victims, as well as real estate purchased with victim funds as part of his plea deal.  Tacuri and other promoters promised investors that their investments in Forcount – a purported crypto mining and trading company – would double within six months. But, according to prosecutors, Forcount was never doing any mining or trading – Tacuri and his associates were simply using new investors’ money to pay back earlier investors and enrich themselves, spending lavishly on luxury goods and real estate.  Prosecutors say Tacuri traveled throughout the U.S. hosting ""lavish expos"" to find new investors, drawing them in with promises of ""achieving financial freedom"" and ""boast[ing] about the amount of money he was earning, including by wearing designer clothing to such events.""  In 2022, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed civil charges against Tacuri and three other members of the scheme with violating the Securities Act – a parallel action to the criminal charges against Tacuri and his associates in New York.  Last year, two other Forcount promoters were arrested and charged with fraud for their role in the scheme.

With a 15% surge in the past 24 hours, FLOKI reached a record price of $0.0003491, solidifying its position as the largest meme coin on the BNB Chain. Floki Inu Receives Major Boost As DFW Labs Invests $12M This surge comes as Web3 investor and crypto market maker DFW Labs announced a substantial investment of $12 million in FLOKI tokens to support the Floki ecosystem. The purchase involved acquiring a portion of the tokens from the market and the remainder from the Floki treasury. Notably, DWF Labs purchased $10 million worth of FLOKI tokens in March, which also triggered a significant price surge of over 30%, propelling the token to a nine-month high then. The partnership between Floki and DWF Labs was initially established in May 2023 when DWF Labs purchased $5 million worth of FLOKI tokens. Since then, DWF Labs has been crucial in boosting FLOKI adoption. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Flatlines With 99% Crash, End Of The Road For SHIB?

Moreover, the team is set to launch several key utility products, including the Floki Trading Bot and the Floki Decentralized Domain Name and Website Service. These upcoming releases have garnered significant attention from investors, resulting in increased buying pressure and a rise in token holders. The protocol boasts a notable milestone, with FLOKI recently surpassing 417,400 holders on the BNB chain. The protocol’s development team declared that Floki remains “the dominant meme coin on the BNB chain,” boasting a substantially larger market capitalization than all other BNB chain memecoins combined. Price Correction Temporarily Impacts FLOKI’s Uptrend According to CoinGecko data, FLOKI’s market capitalization is currently at a substantial $3 billion, nearly doubling compared to its market cap in May, which was $1.7 billion. Furthermore, FLOKI’s daily trading volume has surged by 164% in the past 24 hours, amounting to $1.2 billion, highlighting the token’s market attention from investors and its prevailing bullish sentiment. Despite these positive developments, Floki Inu has experienced a price correction of approximately 8% within a matter of hours. It is currently trading at $0.0003164. The next nearest support level for the token is $0.0002985. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Reveals Top 3 Trades To Take Now While there is a clear path for further growth, Floki Inu faces the challenge of investor decision-making on profit-taking and selling, which could potentially impact the token’s short-term uptrend.

As a result, I've resorted to an analysis of the supply and demand factors which I deem to be most relevant for the price of Bitcoin. On the balance of probability, I believe that my analysis paints the picture that the most likely outcome in the near term is a decline in price. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is one of the most interesting financial assets in modern times to me. The asset is mired in controversy, with avid supporters who believe that its price is set to increase by many multiples in the future and strong detractors who oftentimes believe that Bitcoin isn't worth anything at all. Only a very small number of assets have such a high degree of deviation in what investors believe the asset should be trading for, and it reflects an inherent difficulty in answering the question of Bitcoin's true value. I personally fall into the camp that believes that Bitcoin and most cryptocurrency in general is currently of little to no intrinsic value. I believe this for a myriad of reasons, such as Bitcoin being easily copiable (many have easily launched their own cryptocurrencies with identical properties), as well as it being impractical for transactions without the use of a centralized entity. Furthermore, Bitcoin being the first cryptocurrency, is not as technologically advanced as its successors, which use concepts such as proof of stake. That being said, if you took this stance at nearly any point since Bitcoin's inception, it would've lost you money, so this view won't feature in my analysis. Instead, my analysis will focus on looking at supply/demand dynamics and analyzing the key factors which influence the supply and demand sides of the Bitcoin market. Looking back over the history of Bitcoin, I believe that taking this approach would've, in general, led to more accurate trading decisions than focusing solely on trying to determine an intrinsic value for Bitcoin, and then making investment decisions based on that. Key Factors Influencing Bitcoin Demand: The primary factors which influence the Demand for Bitcoin in my eyes are as follows: Media attention on Bitcoin/crypto: In both 2017 and 2021, media attention contributed significantly to Bitcoin's run-up. Ads for various cryptocurrencies could be seen in airports, on public buses or in subways globally. This increased media attention led to increased buying, causing price increases, again garnering more attention. During these periods, it was common to hear people with otherwise little to no interest in finance talking about cryptocurrency, and celebrity promotion of cryptocurrency was widespread. Increased adoption: The recent Bitcoin rally comes at least in part as a result of the approval of Bitcoin ETFs , which are highly regulated and thus allow investors who are otherwise cautious of putting their money in Bitcoin to invest, as well as encouraging some degree of increase in institutional adoption. The integrity and reputation of the crypto ecosystem: Interestingly, when events occur which show that there can be consequences for nefarious actors in the crypto community, Bitcoin tends to rally. In some ways, this is a facet of increased adoption, since the rallies are likely based on removing fraudsters from the ecosystem being seen as good for long term investment/adoption. A recent example of this is when Bitcoin rallied in anticipation of the sentencing of Sam Bankman-Fried. This can also have a significant impact on supply, with news of fraud, pushing prices down. Sooner/faster than expected interest rate cuts, which tend to benefit risk-on assets. Key Factors Influencing Bitcoin Supply: Bitcoin supply is generally affected by two important factors: Bitcoin's price relative to its recent history: A runup in price can lead to increases in investors looking to sell to lock in gains. Depending on the situation, this effect can however often be counteracted by even more demand to buy, as a result of seeing a runup and hoping it will continue. Bitcoin halving : Every time Bitcoin goes through a halving, the total amount of new Bitcoin awarded to miners decreases. Since miners sell Bitcoin to cover costs which they have to pay in fiat currency, less Bitcoin being awarded to miners restricts Bitcoin supply. Analysis of Demand Factors: Starting on the Demand side; it's clear today that the amount of media attention surrounding Bitcoin and crypto as a whole is fairly minimal compared to the attention it garnered in the past, near the peaks of bull runs. In 2021, you couldn't avoid hearing about or seeing ads for crypto if you tried. Today, that promotion is far more subdued. In my assessment this can mean one of two things: Firstly, that we're not yet at the top of a bull run, or secondly that after the immense hype surrounding cryptocurrency in 2021 and the number of people that lost money investing in it at the time, the broader public are apathetic towards crypto and Bitcoin, leading to the lower media attention we see today. My assessment is that the latter case is more likely. Bitcoin Price vs Searches Chart (Excel) The above chart plotting Bitcoin price vs. Bitcoin Google searches (expressed as a percentage of their all time high figure achieved in 2017), lends evidence to the observation that Bitcoin isn't gaining nearly as much attention as in the past. Furthermore, interest in Bitcoin has begun trending down sharply, whilst prices aren't budging. In the absence of price appreciation, it's difficult to identify a major driver of growth in media attention for Bitcoin. Furthermore, it's evident from the chart that previous periods of growth in the price of Bitcoin have occurred only in conjunction with increasing interest, and when price stagnated, alongside searches, that marked the end of the bull run. In my view, this lends evidence to the case that Bitcoin has reached a near term peak and will begin to trend downwards. Furthermore, in the near term, there don't seem to be significant events on the horizon which would increase adoption. The Bitcoin ETFs obviously did lend themselves to this, but that's already contributed to a large runup in price. The approval and impending launch of Ethereum ETFs could help increase investment in Bitcoin ETFs, if they draw sufficient media attention to crypto ETFs as a whole. However, Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) does compete with Bitcoin as an investment and thus, the launch of Ethereum ETFs could also lead to a decrease in demand for Bitcoin ETFs, as investors use the Ethereum ETFs as a substitute instead. Hence, the net effect of the launch of these ETFs on demand for Bitcoin is blurry, but most likely neutral or moderately positive in the short term, but negative over the longer term, as the effect of media attention as a result of their launch dies down, leaving only a competitor for investment. From an integrity standpoint, I believe that there are unlikely to be any major scandals in the cryptocurrency community in the next few months. The FTX and Binance cases are old news and essentially resolved. The remaining exchanges are generally of higher integrity. Coinbase is even listed on the stock exchange, and thus has far more incentive to operate conservatively and avoid pushing the boundaries of the law. This should have a marginally positive effect on buying and suppress selling. Barring any anomalies, the current trajectory of rates expected by the market appears to be reasonable, and so I'm comfortable to assume that the effect of future fluctuations of interest rates is neutral in expectation. Analysis of Supply Factors: Bitcoin's price is high relative to its recent history. Furthermore, the price is no longer rallying, which is likely to suppress buying from investors hoping to get in on a runup. The effect of this should be straightforward. This should increase selling pressure, as investors look to lock in gains and trim allocations to a volatile asset. Furthermore, whilst the Bitcoin halving typically precedes a rally in the price of Bitcoin. This time, the price rallied prior to halving and has remained steady since then. I view this as a consequence of more sophisticated organizations such as hedge funds trading Bitcoin today, whereas in the past, Bitcoin trading was comprised largely of retail traders. If the expectation is for the price to appreciate upon halving due to a reduction in supply as a result of miners selling, then the rational decision is to buy, prior to halving. If enough sophisticated investors come to the same conclusion, this would lead to a rally prior to halving, rather than after it, which is consistent with what we've seen in the market this time. This leads me to believe that the halving is already priced in by investors, and Bitcoin traders can't expect the old strategy of buying after halving to get in on a rally to work. Bringing it Together: Whilst there are some events on the horizon that are likely to cause marginal demand growth, the lackluster and declining media attention and interest in Bitcoin far outweighs the effects of these events in my eyes. Furthermore, the correlation between searches and price rallies has held strong in the past and significant rallies have only taken place in conjunction with climbing attention and interest, something which isn't present currently. The supply picture isn't looking great for Bitcoin's price either, with the restriction in supply due to halving seeming to be already accounted for, as evidenced by the pre-halving rally. Bitcoin's relatively high price and stagnant rally also gives investors in the green a good chance to trim Bitcoin allocations, which I expect to add to selling pressure. Combining both sides of the market, it looks as though the most likely outcome is that demand lags behind supply, which should result in a declining price. As a result, I'm initiating coverage on Bitcoin with a sell rating.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4697637-bitcoin-interest-is-declining-and-price-may-soon-follow?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/28985249.jpeg

The CEO urged the community to exercise extreme caution while the issue is resolved. Related Reading: Solana-Based GameStop Tribute Token (GME) Soars 300% Following Roaring Kitty’s Return Exciting News: It’s A Scam! On Wednesday, online reports surfaced of suspicious emails being sent to the crypto community. Per the reports, investors received emails from crypto companies offering an upcoming token airdrop. First, users received emails from Bitfinex announcing “exciting news” for the exchange. The email revealed an upcoming ERC20 airdrop of their “new $BFX token” for all Bitfinex users. The reason behind the airdrop was the recent approval of Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETF). The email offered a “claim now” link that redirected to a website asking to connect to the user’s wallet. Despite the suspicious look of the email, investors doubted its legitimacy as it came from the crypto platform’s official address. After being tested by the community, it was quickly revealed that the lookalike website was a scam page. An X user tested the page with an empty wallet and found they were “not eligible” for the airdrop. However, the user tried Rabby Wallet’s watch-only feature with a VB wallet. The user found that all the ETH “would be sent to another wallet, so there was no airdrop for vb.” The destination wallet was empty, which suggested that the scam generated a new wallet for each victim. The user confirmed the theory after testing it with a second wallet. This tactic would make tracking the number of victims and the money involved more difficult. Likewise, several users reported receiving strange emails from Coinbase asking to verify secondary addresses. The racist email claimed that the crypto exchange was shutting down and stated that all funds would be lost if they didn’t verify their secondary email for withdrawal authorization. The email also came from the official Coinbase address. However, the post was unauthorized as the sender used racial slurs and doxed himself. Paolo Ardoino Warns Of Ongoing Crypto Scam Tether and Bitfinex’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, took X to address the situation. In his post, Ardoino revealed he had received reports from two independent sources confirming that a prominent vendor used by crypto companies had suffered a security breach. The vendor, which was not named, manages the mailing lists of several important crypto companies. Similarly, CoinGecko’s COO Bobby Ong warned users about the ongoing supply chain email attack targeting the community: Several crypto companies may be affected via email blasts of fake token launches. Be careful with email newsletters in the coming days. Despite being affected by the security breach, Ong assured users that CoinGecko’s website and mobile app had not been impacted and were safe to use. Moreover, he clarified that the crypto-tracking website was not launching a token, nor did it have plans to. It’s worth noting that this is not the first time a supply chain email attack has targeted the crypto industry. In January, a massive phishing campaign drained around $600,000 from investors after a scammer sent unauthorized emails from different crypto-related companies. Related Reading: Ethereum (ETH) Set For ‘Glorious Year,’ Analyst Eyes $10,000 Target It was revealed at the time that a member of the exploited vendor’s customer support team became the initial point of compromise.

BTC ""ready to squeeze higher"" with some $1.5 billion worth of shorts concentrated around the $72,000 area that can be liquidated, Matrixport noted.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} options traders are increasingly positioning for the asset to hit fresh record prices this month, market data suggests.  ""Our desk saw strong bullish follow-through with significant call buying for June expiries, indicating positioning in the options market for a decisive break of 74,000 all-time-highs this month,"" digital asset hedge fund QCP said in a Wednesday market update.  Options are derivative contracts that give buyers the right to buy or sell an asset at a certain price before or at a predetermined date when the contract expires. If the underlying asset doesn't reach the strike price (out of the money), the option will expire worthless. Purchasing calls implies a bullish outlook for an asset's price, while put option buyers are bearish.  ""Options flow was clearly bullish today with big sizes on long BTC OTM [out of the money] call spreads in end June, and to a lower extent end July,"" institutional crypto derivatives trading network Paradigm said in a Telegram broadcast.  Joshua Lim, co-founder of crypto derivatives principal trading firm Arbelos Markets, noted ""very concentrated call buying"" on Tuesday with about 1100 contracts purchased of June 28 expiration call spreads in $74,000-$80,000 strikes, representing around $80 million notional demand.  A call spread is an options trading strategy in which buys of call options at a lower strike price and are made alongside sales of the same amount of calls at a higher strike price with the same expiry, aiming to profit from a limited price increase.  Bitcoin has spent almost three months consolidating since notching an all-time high slightly below $74,000 in mid-March. After plummeting briefly below $57,000 in early May, it saw a steady recovery, now changing hands at around $71,000, only a few percentage points from new record prices.  Crypto investment services firm Matrixport said in a Wednesday X post that bitcoin ""appears to be ready to squeeze higher,"" supported by heavy inflows to U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds and rising open interest in the futures market.

42417996,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcDYD,1717619619,The Protocol: Another Episode in the Layer-2 Teams Drama,"Ethereum's layer-2 teams are butting heads once again. This time, major figures in the space are condemning Matter Labs, the creator of zkSync, over its decision to trademark the acronym ""ZK,"" which is shorthand for ""zero-knowledge” cryptography, the core technology underlying zkSync and a plethora of other blockchain projects. Matter Labs claimed it made the move to protect users. Leaders from Polygon and Starkware–competitors in the layer-2 space–disagreed, arguing that trademarking public goods does not serve the interests of the Ethereum ecosystem.  In this week's newsletter, we'll recap this latest episode in the layer-2 saga and a slate of other industry updates that you won't want to miss.  ALSO:  Consensus 2024 wrap up.  Starkware, the Ethereum layer-2 team, unveils its plan to start scaling the Bitcoin blockchain, too.  Avail, the data availability spinoff from Polygon, shares it has raised $43 million in a Series A fuding round.  The team behind Bitcoin layer-2 network Ark has created a new company that will focus on faster and cheaper Bitcoin transactions, putting it head-to-head with the Lightning Network.  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Also please check out our weekly The Protocol podcast.  Network news  ZK Trademark Filing Rile Layer 2 Teams: Matter Labs, the main development firm behind the zkSync Era blockchain, received major blowback from fellow Ethereum layer-2 teams after it unveiled plans to trademark the term ""ZK."" The week-long clash resulted in Matter Labs withdrawing its trademark application, which it initially said was necessary to protect the Ethereum community against similarly-named projects and token tickers. ZK, or zero-knowledge, is a type of cryptography used by certain layer-2 rollups and other blockchain projects to quickly prove that transaction details are true while keeping other details private. The tech is closely associated with attempts to scale the Ethereum blockchain. Layer-2 networks like Polygon, StarkNet and zkSync all use ZK proofs to help provide users with quicker and cheaper transactions. Matter Labs’ move to trademark ZK came after a tiff with Polyhedra, a blockchain project that used ""ZK"" as the ticker for its token. Matter Labs has been preparing for its own highly-anticipated token airdrop and planned to take the ""ZK"" ticker for itself. (Polyhedra ultimately decided to rebrand its token to ""ZKJ,"" according to reporting from The Block.) When Matter Labs initially revealed its plan to trademark ZK, it ignited an ecosystem-wide outcry. Given that ZK technology—and the term itself—are used by many teams across the industry, the trademark filing was seen as an attempt by a single company to seize ownership over a ""public good."" More broadly, this was viewed as an attack on crypto's open-source and collaborative ethos. In a statement shared with CoinDesk, StarkWare CEO Eli Ben-Sasson called the move “an absurd IP-grab.” Polygon Chief Legal Officer Rebecca Rettig wrote on X that trademarking a term is to “protect a company’s brand” rather than the wider crypto community.  This isn’t the first time that Matter Labs has found itself in hot water with its competitors. In August 2023, the Polygon team went on a media blitz with the claim that Matter Labs had copied its Plonky-2 software system without proper attribution. Leaders from other teams, like Starkware, also weighed in at the time, expressing their disappointment with Matter Labs. (Gluchowski denied the claims of copyingbut said his team “could have done better” by providing clearer attribution to other teams' open-source code.) Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal seemed to reference the debacle when he weighed in on the earlier dispute, saying in a statement last week that ""zkSync has repeatedly acted contrary to the Web3 ethos, despite consistently signaling those same values. We believe that if we do not publicly address this behavior, it will persist and potentially worsen."" Alex Gluchowski, the CEO of Matter Labs, initially dismissed the complaints, sharing that his intention with the trademark application was to protect users and adding that Matter Labs would eventually move to share the trademark with a yet-to-exist consortium of ecosystem stakeholders. Three days later, however, Matter Labs opted to walk back on its trademark efforts entirely.  Consensus 2024 Debrief: Last week, CoinDesk’s 10th annual Consensus festival took place in Austin, Texas, and what a whirlwind it was! This year, the conference had a pronounced focus on policy and regulation. Last month's surprise ether (ETH) ETF approval, the bipartisan vote to repeal the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) crypto accounting policy (SAB121), and the wider Democratic softening towards crypto in the past few weeks were on everyone's minds. Independent U.S. presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stopped by to share his thoughts on crypto policy, and he also gave his opinion on former President Donald J. Trump’s guilty verdict in his hush-money trial. Another trend at the center of Consensus was AI and its intersection with Blockchain. Consensus even dedicated an entire day (May 31) to AI discussions on the Gen C Stage. And finally, vibe checks were all around, with many still figuring out if crypto is on the cusp of another bear or bull run. The takeaway: it isn’t exactly clear.  Protocol Village  Top picks of the past week from our Protocol Village column, highlighting key blockchain tech upgrades and news.  Starkware, the main developer firm behind the Ethereum layer-2 StarkNet, announced its plans to start scaling on the Bitcoin blockchain too, dedicating $1 million towards Bitcoin research and funding.  Polygon Labs, the main development firm behind the Polygon blockchain, shared that co-founder and Executive chairman Sandeep Nailwal will also be taking on the role as chief business officer. The team said that Naiwal ""has been actively engaged in collaborating with developers and enterprises since Polygon’s inception,” and that the new role is a formalization of the work he already does with the team.  Linea, the layer-2 blockchain from ConsenSys, stopped producing blocks for an hour after an exploit on the decentralized exchange Velocore. After the issue was patched, the Linea team pledged that it would focus its efforts on decentralizing its network and sequencer as the blockchain matures.  Ether.fi, the largest liquid restaking protocol on EigenLayer, will let its users install a mobile wallet, called Etherfi Cash and use a Visa credit card that borrows USDC against their DeFi investments that can be paid off with crypto. The Cash visa card is expected to start rolling out in December.  Bitcoin Gets More Scaling  Bitcoin scaling continues to be a major focus for the oldest blockchain ecosystem, and now the team behind Bitcoin layer-2 protocol Ark has created a new company that will focus on cheap and fast payments.  Ark Labs, the new company, will compete with Bitcoin's Lightning Network with its own solution for scaling the blockchain's transaction capacity.  The company shared that it will pursue scalability by developing “an open implementation of the Ark Protocol” and “building services for users,” CoinDesk’s Jamie Crawley writes.  The open implementation of Ark is expected to happen in 2024.  Read the full post by Jamie Crawley here  Money Center  Fundraisings  Avail, which spun out of Polygon and is known for its data availability solution, shared that they have raised $43 million in a seed round. The fresh round of capital will go towards building out its core products.  Stablecoin protocol El Dorado completed a $3 million seed round to build a crypto payments ""superapp"" for users in Latin America.  Connext has rebranded to Everclear to build a Clearing Layer for Web3, solving liquidity fragmentation for modular blockchains. Everclear secured $5 million from Pantera Capital and launched its testnet to reduce liquidity management costs across chains. According to Everclear, their system ""can reduce the cost and complexity of solving and liquidity management across chains by as much as 90%.""  API3 has completed a strategic funding round led by DWF Labs, raising $4 million. The funding will enhance liquidity and support API3’s growth strategy, according to the company. API3’s Total Value Secured (TVS) has increased significantly to over $1 billion, the team says, as it has integrated with new chains like Optimism Superchain and Worldcoin.  SCRYPT, a provider of crypto asset financial services, has closed a $5 million strategic funding round led by Braza Bank. This funding will support SCRYPT’s expansion in LATAM and enhance its product offerings.  Deals and grants  Polygon Labs, the development firm behind Polygon, announced that it has acquired Toposware, a blockchain engineering firm focused on zero-knowledge technology. Sources close to the deal told CoinDesk that the acquisition was in the range of $30 million to $50.  Mantle EcoFund, with a capital pool of $200M, deployed $5M in its second capital call. ""Seven Mantle Ecosystem SocialFi and gaming projects have received fresh funding: MetaCene, Blade Games, Co-Museum, Fingerlabs, L3E7, and DreamOS,"" said Mantle. ""The newly inducted projects within Mantle EcoFund portfolio underscore Mantle’s belief in the transformative power of SocialFi and gaming applications to onboard the next billion users to web3.""

42418004,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcDiX,1717619567,Advocacy Group 'Stand With Crypto' Says It's Exceeded 1 Million Signups,"Organizers of Stand With Crypto say the advocacy group is directing a wave of crypto-interested voters toward shifting digital assets policy in the U.S.  In about 10 months since launching, the organization has gathered millions in donations and also started its own political action committee to influence individual races.  Stand With Crypto, a digital assets advocacy group backed by Coinbase Inc., said it signed up its first million members as of Wednesday.  The rapidly growing online band of crypto boosters maintains grades on U.S. politicians (as Coinbase once did), sets up public events to highlight digital assets issues and has recently established a political action committee (PAC) to engage directly with candidates. Membership in the organization is as simple as a quick online signup, and the list allows anonymity, though Chief Strategist Nick Carr said the vast majority have given physical addresses.  ""One million advocates from across state and political lines are sending a clear message to Washington. Crypto is a frontline issue, and we have the numbers to back it up,"" Carr said in a statement.  The website for the group, which was established in August of last year, said it's collected millions in donations and aims to use that money to mobilize U.S. crypto enthusiasts toward political outcomes that favor the technology.  ""Stand With Crypto surpassed its goal of one million Stand With Crypto advocates faster than ever imagined,"" said Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, who is also among the group's leading donors, in a statement. ""With exactly five months until the general election, crypto voters are not taking their foot off the gas.""  Read More: Coinbase-Backed Advocacy Group Enlists Crypto Masses, Raises $2M From 80,000  The crypto industry has taken an increasingly serious role in political advocacy this year, pumping more than $160 million into a campaign-finance effort that rivals major industries (and even the political parties' own congressional war chests). It has also anonymously supported at least one political organization, the Cedar Innovation Foundation, to apply pressure on Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), whose Senate Banking Committee has so far failed to take up major crypto legislation.  Two recent industry-sponsored surveys conducted by Harris Polls found a large number of voters seem interested in candidates' crypto views. In the most recent one, one-third of voters said they'll consider views on digital assets before making candidate decisions. However, another poll of swing state voters suggested that as many as 69% of them had negative views of cryptocurrency.",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/06/05/advocacy-group-stand-with-crypto-says-its-exceeded-one-million-signups,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/01e640b8f71cb9c686fbd7850cefdf25e1a6c6a6-6000x3375.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Here, we highlight the top four altcoins that are poised to offer substantial returns in 2024. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Reveals Top 3 Trades To Take Now 1. MAGA VP ($MVP) MAGA VP ($MVP) is making waves in the crypto community with its unique blend of political engagement and rewarding mechanisms. Known for its strong community support and strategic partnerships, $MVP offers token holders rewards in $TRUMP tokens and participates in significant political events. Recent developments include the launch of a new app featuring a prize pool for voting activities, making it a compelling investment for 2024. 2. NOT Token Notcoin is a Telegram-based game that has garnered the interest of millions of players in recent months. The game has amassed a total of 35 million players, reaching a peak of six million daily active users. This makes it significantly more popular than most other crypto games. After experiencing a retracement from its previous high, Notcoin (NOT) has started to show significant bullish momentum, capturing the attention of both traders and investors alike. This continuing upward trend suggests a strong level of market confidence and growing optimism regarding its future potential. 3. Solana (SOL) Solana continues to be a favorite among investors due to its high-speed transactions and scalability. Solana (SOL) is an open-source project leveraging blockchain’s permissionless structure to provide decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. The platform has experienced a surge in the total value locked (TVL) in its DeFi applications. This trend is also boosting the popularity of meme coins on the Solana blockchain. Should market conditions shift, this dynamic could position Solana as a noteworthy crypto asset, making it one of the top altcoins poised for significant growth. 4. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum remains a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency market. With ongoing upgrades like Ethereum 2.0 and ETF involvement, ETH is set to maintain its position as a leading investment option. Despite facing criticism for high transaction fees, Ethereum remains a dominant force in the crypto space, powering thousands of applications and other altcoins with its robust blockchain infrastructure.

He also suggested that there was no need to worry about Dogecoin’s current price action, which paints a bearish outlook for the meme coin. Dogecoin Will Outpace Bitcoin In This Market Cycle Crypto Kaleo mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that he has “an insanely high conviction” that Dogecoin will “outpace” Bitcoin in this market cycle. He made this statement while revealing that he is also bullish on the flagship crypto. Given how high Bitcoin is expected to rise in this bull run, this undoubtedly paints an ultra-bullish narrative for the foremost meme coin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Gets Massive $500,000 Price Tag From Billionaire, Here’s Why From the chart he shared, Crypto Kaleo predicts that Dogecoin could rise over 200% against its Bitcoin pair and climb to as high as $0.55. He is convinced that Dogecoin can make such a run because he claims the market is in a “meme super cycle.”As such, he remarked that the “king of memes won’t be left behind.” Despite this being a meme super cycle like Crypto Kaleo claims, Dogecoin’s price has continued to lag compared to other meme coins. However, the analyst suggested that DOGE’s current price action is normal, stating that the meme coin “moves sideways for extended periods, followed by rapid vertical growth.” In an earlier X post, the analyst suggested that this “rapid vertical growth” could happen once GameStop’s (GME) stock tops. He drew a correlation between both assets, noting that Dogecoin’s price rallied in the 2021 bull run after GME topped. He expects something similar to happen this time, especially with Roaring Kitty’s return. Meanwhile, Crypto Kaleo isn’t the only one who believes that Dogecoin can outperform Bitcoin in this market cycle. Crypto analyst Don Alt also seems to hold this belief as he previously suggested that Dogecoin was a better investment than Bitcoin based on his claim that Dogecoin can rise to as high as $2 in this bull run. DOGE Going To Go Parabolic Later This Year Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa has also offered a bullish narrative for Dogecoin. In a recent X post, he stated that the foremost meme coin “is going to do something stupid later this year,” suggesting that a parabolic rise was on the horizon for Dogecoin. He added that Dogecoin is still one of the “safest trades” anyone can make in this cycle. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Forecasts A 4,000% XRP Price Run To $30, Here’s When He also seems to believe that Dogecoin can outperform Bitcoin in this cycle, noting in another X post that Dogecoin was one of the few altcoins that increased and held above their Bitcoin pair in the 2021 bull run.

While this obviously impacts customers of traditional financial institutions, the personal privacy of participants in the digital asset economy may be seriously compromised as well.  Marisa Coppel is the head of legal for the Blockchain Association. Amanda Tuminelli serves as the DeFi Education Fund's chief legal officer where she leads the organization's impact litigation and policy efforts.  Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.  Designed to collect and store detailed customer data across U.S. financial markets, the CAT will be the largest database of securities transactions ever built. Even if built under the guise to “allow regulators to efficiently and accurately track all activity throughout the U.S. markets,” CAT threatens to make massive unchecked government surveillance a reality.  Under the SEC’s CAT-related requirements, regulated entities will be forced to collect a multitude of data points about trades, traders and retail customers, including customer names, addresses and account details. As for digital asset market participants, this information could end up including transaction identifiers and wallet addresses, giving those with access to the database insight into users’ forward- and backward-looking transaction information for all time.  The implications for the digital asset industry are worrying, especially given the recent finalization of the Dealer rule-making, which the Blockchain Association and others are challenging in federal court, and even more so if the SEC finalizes the proposed rule that would vastly expand the definition of what constitutes an “exchange.”  If these new rules are allowed to stand, the newly-minted “dealers” and “exchanges” will be required to report digital asset users’ information to the CAT.  This means unprecedented amounts of crypto trading data and personal customer information will be caught in the SEC's surveillance dragnet. To make matters worse, CAT data is not available only to the SEC and its thousands of staff. Individually identifiable data in CAT is accessible to a web of related government agencies and private self-regulated organizations, without a warrant or reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing. This vastly expands the universe of who could potentially gain access to Americans' personal financial lives and trading activities, all in the name of making the SEC’s job a little easier.  Former Attorney General William Barr recently expressed concerns over the potential violations of constitutional rights that will occur because of CAT: ""The Constitution prohibits mass surveillance of private activities based merely on the possibility that someone might commit a crime ... Even when the government seeks information about a citizen ... it must normally show that it is investigating specific suspected wrongdoing.""  Yet, one searches in vain for any statement by the SEC concerning how it will respect individual constitutional rights.  In fact, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce has sounded the alarm on CAT's unchecked surveillance state implications for years, explaining that the cost ""to liberty and privacy is not worth the purported benefit. After all, tracking our trading behavior won’t stop bad events from happening in the markets, it will just make it a bit easier to understand what happened after the fact.""  In addition to privacy concerns, this database represents the ultimate “honeypot” of information, making it particularly attractive to hackers. While the SEC recognized this dramatic security risk in a 2020 proposal to enhance security of the database, it has yet to implement amendments to CAT that would increase cybersecurity, despite organizations like the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) sounding the alarm.  See also: SEC's Gensler Going Rogue in Solo Quest to Stop U.S. Crypto Regulation | Opinion  It is not surprising then that the SEC has already been sued twice over their implementation of the CAT database. The American Securities Association and Citadel jointly petitioned the 11th Circuit in October 2023 and the New Civil Liberties Alliance filed a complaint in the Western District of Texas in April 2024 to challenge CAT’s release. Although these two lawsuits are perfect examples of why the judiciary is so important in curbing grave government overreach, the crypto world must recognize how antithetical CAT is to its core ethos, and to expectations of privacy presumed by all Americans.  Remember, privacy is normal. We should not regress into a societal norm where privacy equates to wrongdoing, especially in personal financial matters, lest we get closer to the Washington D.C., featured in Minority Report. One shouldn’t feel like their government is looking over their shoulder as they complete every personal financial transaction, especially when those transactions may include revealing sensitive information such as through donations to political causes or paying for medical procedures.  In addition to taking the opportunities to help educate the court as amici in the ongoing lawsuits mentioned above, the crypto community should make our opposition known on this latest regulatory overreach by voicing concern to elected representatives about CAT. Excessively broad financial surveillance regimes like CAT are a significant threat to Americans' constitutional rights and cannot be allowed to quietly become law.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,"Amanda Tuminelli, Marisa T.

JPMorgan said CoreWeave’s deal with Core Scientific validates the mining sector’s pivot to HPC.  The report said that bitcoin miners under financial pressure following the recent halving may be more susceptible to a deal.  Hyperscalers and artificial intelligence (AI) firms are exploring different alternatives to securing their energy needs, and this may make bitcoin {{BTC}} mining companies with attractive power contracts appealing acquisition targets, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report on Wednesday.  A hyperscaler is a large-scale data center specializing in delivering huge amounts of computing power.  Mergers and acquisitions are heating up in the mining sector, after the halving. On Tuesday, shares of Core Scientific (CORZ) surged higher after cloud computing firm CoreWeave signed a 200 megawatts (MW) artificial intelligence deal with the bitcoin miner, and was also reported to have made an offer to buy the company in an all-cash deal. Meanwhile, another large bitcoin miner, Riot Platforms (RIOT), made a hostile offer to buy out peer Bitfarms (BITF) last month.  Read more: Bitcoin Halving Is Poised to Unleash Darwinism on Miners  The deal with CoreWeave validates and may accelerate the mining sector’s involvement in high-performance computing (HPC), JPMorgan said in the report. Within the bank’s coverage, the Core Scientific news is most impactful to overweight-rated Iris Energy (IREN), which it said was early to embrace HPC and has the rights to develop over 2 gigawatts (GW) of power.  JPMorgan said this deal could raise the “valuation floor for sub-scale mining operators, as a new class of buyers (Hyperscalers) has emerged.” The bank also added that it could help “rationalize the bitcoin network” by moving power capacity away from the miners, and this would improve the profits of the remaining operators.  The bank estimates that U.S. listed bitcoin miners draw up to 5 GW of power and have access to an additional 2.5 GW, “which makes them a potentially attractive target.”  Furthermore, some bitcoin miners are under financial pressure to exit the market following the recent halving event and so may be more receptive to a deal, the report added.  Broker Bernstein said last week that Riot Platforms (RIOT) was the best positioned to attempt to consolidate the mining sector, as the miner has the financial capacity for deal-making.

The layer 2 network has a focus on bringing real-world assets on-chain, with a particular focus on the tokenization of physical assets, and features built-in protections against transaction ordering and MEV.  Blockchain network IOTA has started its layer 2 Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) network with a focus on real-world asset usage, the developers shared with CoinDesk over email.  Tuesday's launch introduced functionality such as smart contracts, cross-chain capabilities, parallel processing and security against Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) into the IOTA ecosystem, boosting the fundamentals of the IOTA token. The token has advanced 6% in the past 24 hours, data from CoinGecko show, while the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a measure of the broader crypto market, gained less than 2%.  The layer 2 will have a particular focus on decentralized financial (DeFi) applications and real-world assets (RWA) usage, IOTA co-founder Dominik Schiener said in a Telegram message. RWA refers to a sector within the cryptocurrency market that focuses on the tokenization of tangible assets that exist in the physical world.  “We are positioning IOTA to bring the real world to Web3 and help to bring trillions of assets and institutional investors on-chain,” Schiener said. “With the establishment of the IOTA Ecosystem DLT Foundation as the first DLT foundation registered under the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) regulations, IOTA is uniquely positioned to lead in Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization.”  “We have adapted our technology stack specifically to adapt to the needs of institutional investors, including our on-chain KYC project to identify investors and enable institutional DeFi trading pools, and the MEV-resistance of our network to protect investors and meet regulatory compliance,” he added.  MEV is a predatory way for network validators to extract fees by rearranging and reordering transactions waiting to be added to the blockchain. The IOTA EVM claims to have a built-in feature to prevent transaction ordering, which helps avoid extracting value from the fees users pay to use the network.  Parallel processing involves sending multiple network transactions simultaneously instead of sequentially. This enables blockchain scaling, lower gas costs, and higher transaction processing speed.",POSITIVE,IOTA,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | IOTA,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/06/05/iota-kickstarts-evm-targeting-defi-real-world-assets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/93ea0172c8543ad9b604cadca341b8f987399566-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The SEC chair remained vague about exactly when the industry may see the next major crypto token wrapped in ETFs.  The approval of new exchange traded funds (ETFs) for Ethereum's ether {{ETH}} is a logical next step to the regulator previously approving spot bitcoin ETFs, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler seemed to suggest twice on Wednesday.  Despite the crypto industry's widespread belief that Gensler's SEC was planning to block the ETH spot ETF before reversing course and granting the first stage of applications, the head of the agency sped through an account of its ongoing approval process as if it were a casual matter, echoing himself in two separate interviews – in a CNBC appearance and on the sidelines of an International Swaps and Derivatives Association/Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association event.  ""Ethereum had been traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange futures for three-plus years. And the staff looked at that closely, and that was approved,"" Gensler said in the television interview. ""Now, the underlying exchange traded products (ETPs) still need to go through a process to have the disclosure about that. That will take some time, but they're working on that right now.""  He later told reporters that SEC staff approved ETF applicants' 19b-4 forms ""as four months earlier at the commission level, we had approved the bitcoin exchange-traded products.""  His updates didn't reflect the drama associated with this major moment for the digital assets sector, which would follow the January approval of the earlier bitcoin spot ETFs that already redefined the status of {{BTC}} as a trading asset.  Industry observers and participants widely expected the ETF applications to be rejected, citing a lack of public engagement from the SEC with applicants over their forms. This changed a few weeks ago, when the SEC asked exchanges to update 19b-4 forms on an expedited basis.  Gensler's tone does track, though, with another of his recent appearances, in which he indicated that once the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Grayscale against the SEC, the regulator's hand was forced when it came to such ETF approvals.  ""We do it within the law and how the courts interpret the law, and that's what I'm deeply committed to,"" Gensler had said two weeks ago, after having noted on stage at the event that the agency is trying to act in accordance with the court's ruling.  That position would suggest that the SEC was going to approve ETH ETFs all along, just like BTC.  Also, despite Gensler's seemingly sanguine explanation of the current process with the ETH applications, his comments left a key question still hanging: He said it'll ""take some time,"" but when might this final approval happen? The precise answer seems unclear, so far.  Some expect the funds, which would directly hold actual ETH and could be easily traded at any time just like other ETFs, will emerge this month or next.  Securities disclosures  Apart from his seeming openness on the ETF applications, Gensler reiterated his usual warnings Wednesday about the crypto industry and its lack of required public disclosures.  He said on CNBC that many of the tokens ""have not given you the disclosures that you not only need to make your investment decisions, but also that are required by law.""  When asked by reporters if he personally believes ether to be a security,he pointed to the fact that entrepreneurs and executives speak at conferences to promote their projects (while carrying out his usual disclaimer of not speaking to any specific asset).  ""These are the indicia of a security,"" he said, reiterating his earlier statement on legally-required disclosures. ""What's more, you have the so-called crypto exchanges that are commingling and bundling functions where you, the investing public, do not have proper protection of the Congress laid out in the laws.""  As a result, the industry has faced the various bankruptcies and frauds that it has, he said.  While Gensler said the Satoshi Nakamoto bitcoin white paper may have been ""innovative,"" Gensler said, ""this is a field that's quite centralized, that has not lived up to the vision, the Nakamoto vision when there's just a small handful of crypto intermediaries in which you're trusting your money, your assets.""

This was highlighted in a recent report that showed how crypto assets have provided the best returns for a while now. Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Solana Outperform Traditional Assets Raoul Pal, Co-Founder of Exponential Age Asset Management (EXPAAM), shared the crypto investment firm’s latest monthly update, showing annualized returns on all major assets. Related Reading: Dogecoin Social Sentiment Turns Bearish And Drops To March Levels, What This Means For Price Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana have topped traditional assets with annualized returns of 141%, 152%, and 224%, respectively. For context, NDX, the best major traditional asset, boasts an annualized return of 17%. Thanks to this, these crypto assets have been the best-performing assets in 11 of the last 14 years. These digital assets also look on course to outperform traditional assets again this year, as they boast higher year-to-date (YTD) gains. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana currently have YTD gains of over 67%, 66% and 70%, respectively. On the other hand, Gold, the best-performing non-crypto asset this year, has a YTD gain of 13%. The NDX boasts a YTD gain of 10%, while the SPY has recorded a YTD gain of 11%. Interestingly, while the volatility of crypto assets has been criticized at times, this has largely contributed to why they have continued outperforming traditional assets. The Director of Global Macro at Fidelity Investments, Jurrien Timmer, previously highlighted how Bitcoin has continued to record the best risk-reward since 2020. He also alluded to Bitcoin’s high volatility, stating that Bitcoin’s huge drawdowns have also come with large gains. The same can also said about crypto tokens, especially considering that a token like Solana, which dropped to as low as $10 in late 2022, is now trading above $170. More Gains Ahead For BTC, ETH, SOL Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are expected to record more YTD gains as the year progresses, given that the crypto market is currently in a bull run. Recent developments in the crypto market also paint a bullish outlook for these crypto tokens. One is the increased demand for the Spot Bitcoin ETFs.

USDL is regulated by the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) of Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM).  Cryptocurrency trading platform Paxos has introduced a yield-generating, USD-denominated stablecoin called the Lift Dollar (USDL), regulated in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the company said on Wednesday.  The stablecoin is issued by Paxos International, the firm’s UAE division, and regulated by the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) of Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM).  The largest stablecoin issuers, such as Tether and Circle, gather billions of dollars worth of interest on the T-Bills they hold, which has led to the creation of several yield-sharing stablecoins and blockchain-based U.S. Treasury products.  Paxos CEO Charles Cascarilla said the new Lift Dollar is structured the same way as the other stablecoins issued by his firm: PayPal USD (PYUSD), Pax Dollar (USDP) and Pax Gold (PAXG). These are matched 1:1 with dollars, backed by short-term U.S. government securities, and all are overseen by a prudential regulator with all assets safely positioned remote from a potential bankruptcy situation, he said.  “We’ve added programmatic daily yield so this looks a little bit more like a savings product than a checking account product, which is maybe the way to think about traditional stablecoins,” Cascarilla said in an interview. “[USDL] is going one step further from democratizing access to dollars, to also democratizing the risk-free rate, in the safest manner possible.”  Paxos USDL will not be available in the U.S. because of a lack of regulatory guidance.  At launch, USDL will be particularly focused on Argentina, where it will be available to consumers via distribution partners Ripio, Buenbit and TiendaCrypto, according to a press release.  “For the launch, we're foregoing the 30 basis points (bips) of our asset management fee.

42417991,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcDU5,1717604153,Binance Asks UK Competition Tribunal to Throw Out Most of Collusion Case: Reuters,"Binance lawyers asked the Competition Appeal Tribunal to remove claims BSV could have become a major cryptocurrency had it not been delisted.  Holders of the token missed out on a potential $9 billion of gains, according to litigant BSV Claims.  Binance asked the U.K.'s Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) to throw out most of a collusion case against it and three other crypto exchanges brought by BSV Claims in a suit that could be worth as much as 10 billion British pounds ($13 billion), Reuters reported.  The exchanges delisted the token in 2019, in what BSV Claims argues was collusion in anticompetitive behavior. As a result token holders missed out on potential gains of more than 9 billion pounds, the firm said. It calculated the loss by looking at gains made by other cryptocurrencies since then, BitMEX Research said.  Binance asked the tribunal to remove claims BSV could have become a major cryptocurrency. Binance laywer Brian Kennelly said BSV holders ""could reasonably have sold it and reinvested it in comparable cryptocurrency"", according to Reuters.  The case is being brought on behalf of an estimated 240,000 U.K. investors, BSV Claims said when it was established in 2022.

42418020,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcGGT,1717603857,Crypto Security Firm Ironblocks Builds 'Firewall' for DeFi Protocols,"Blockchain security platform Ironblocks has a new tool for DeFi developers who want to add security to their smart contracts.  At launch, the service has three big-ticket users: the zkEVM chain Linea, AltLayer and the layer-2 network Kinto – with more on the way.  A cottage industry of crypto security firms police the aftermath of protocol hacks and heists. Now one of them is out with a ""firewall"" aimed at stopping those thefts beforehand.  Blockchain security platform Ironblocks' new tool is a free service for developers who want to add security to their smart contracts, CEO Or Dadosh told CoinDesk. Called Firewall, it allows them to plug-and-play various security ""policies"" to monitor transactions on their decentralized finance protocols for suspicious attempts.  The open-source toolkit could offer at least some salve to the ever-present threat of hacks in DeFi. Dadosh estimated any given week brings with it as many as 10 different hacks of protocols offering lending, trading, staking or other financial services to crypto holders. Those heists add up: PeckShield estimated $60 million in losses in April.  Firewall sits inside the smart contracts processing protocols' transactions, Dadosh said. Developers get their pick of a handful of policies that scour the flow for sketchy patterns and other tells that a hack is in progress.  ""It doesn't stop or pause the application, it just stops the specific transaction that may attack the application, just like in web2 firewalls,"" Dadosh said.  At launch, the service has three big-ticket users: the zkEVM chain Linea, AltLayer and the layer-2 network Kinto. Dadosh said more are on the way.  Because the service is free to use, it is not meant to be a direct moneymaker for Ironblocks, an Israeli startup that last raised $7 million in venture funding in early 2023. Instead, it's a feeder for the company's other crypto cyber defense products including the upcoming ""Venn Security Network,"" according to its website. Dadosh was hesitant to discuss what the network would look like.  But the Firewall toolkit could offer a step forward for security in an ecosystem where code immutability makes incremental updates – a bug here, a potential exploit there – hard to patch on the go. Dadosh said developers can add more policies to their code after the fact, and remove them, too.  How the developers make these changes is really up to them. Perhaps they could turn the decisions over to their projects' token-holding governance communities, to a wallet controlled by multiple parties (a multisig) or to the DAO.  The point is to stop the hacks before they happen.  ""Once you get hacked, in most of the cases, you're done,"" Dadosh said. ""And this is what we're trying to prevent.""",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/06/05/crypto-security-firm-ironblocks-builds-firewall-for-defi-protocols,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b3a039a113c69c1cc4ae9c0289a3fdda37b77b97-5329x2998.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42418028,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcGNh,1717603200,The Blockspace Singularity,"For years, crypto skeptics and believers alike have decried the lack of mainstream use cases for blockchain technology. Thousands of decentralized applications have been deployed, but mainstream use cases are scarce. That may be about to change.  A singularity, a point of infinitely dense matter, is theorized to have caused the Big Bang when one such point exploded, distributing matter throughout the universe. I think we’re at an analogous moment in the history of crypto.  Over the last year, developers have delivered fast, cheap blockspace to builders.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  The “majors” have made huge strides, with Ethereum (ETH) deploying its Dencun upgrade in March, reducing transaction costs for users of layer-2 blockchains to less than $0.01. Solana (SOL) has (largely) fixed the downtime issues that plagued it until last year, leading to a massive surge in economic value on the protocol.  New entrants have also been coming thick and fast. New layer-1 blockchains such as Sui, Sei, Aptos (APT) and others have launched in the past 18 months, promising unprecedented levels of throughput. This process is nowhere near complete, with yet another cohort of new and heralded blockchains expected to come to market with novel design elements throughout 2024 and beyond:  The experimentation stage begins  Chris Dixon, in his new book ""Read Write Own,"" predicts that “a key moment will be when the infrastructure becomes so good that application developers no longer need to think about infrastructure.”  Since crypto began, application developers have only had to think about infrastructure. Even if you had a novel idea for a crypto use case, infrastructure limitations likely kept you from executing it.  Now that multiple blockchains with diverse designs can operate reliably at scale and low cost, developers can focus on what they can do, rather than what they can’t.  The figure below illustrates just how much tech there is to be experimented with:  Recently, we’ve seen novel ideas for decentralized social media and social finance; DePIN networks that utilize high throughput blockchain solutions to enable real-world utilities; and AI-adjacent tools such as decentralized compute networks and AI agent platforms.  Over time, novel applications will only get more popular and more performant as they work out what infrastructure best suits their needs. Perhaps this process will end with scaled applications running on modular solutions settling back to Ethereum, or maybe the monolithic vision will win, and Solana, Monad, Aptos or Sui will become the preferred blockchain of the masses. In the end, the market will decide what solutions work best once they can be tested at scale.  Read the rest of the article on our website: The Blockspace Singularity – Runa Digital Assets.

42418022,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcGJZ,1717603200,A More Than $1T Bitcoin DeFi Opportunity,"Since its inception in 2009, bitcoin (BTC) has steadily gained adoption and now has a market capitalization of over $1.3 trillion. It was designed to be a decentralized currency and real-time gross settlement system. The decentralized, protocol-based approach enables holders to shift trust from a centralized actor to a decentralized, code-enforced protocol.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Despite bitcoin being the original cryptocurrency and corresponding blockchain, its functionality has been extremely limited up to this point relative to the smart contracts and decentralized finance (DeFi) functionality offered by Ethereum, Solana and other blockchains. However, this dynamic is set to change with the emergence of Bitcoin Layers, the meta-protocols, sidechains, layer 2’s and other technologies currently being built on the Bitcoin blockchain. These layers will enable faster payments, as well as lending, enhanced functionality of fungible and non-fungible tokens, decentralized exchanges, GameFi, SocialFi and many other use cases. Holders of bitcoin will soon be able to increase the productivity of their asset via a protocol-based decentralized financial system. The primary differentiator between DeFi on Bitcoin and DeFi on other chains is the underlying asset (native token). Whereas Ethereum, Solana and next-gen blockchains compete on the merits of their respective technologies, DeFi on Bitcoin is purely focused on increasing the productivity of bitcoin, placing the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem in a league of its own.  The case for value creation via a Bitcoin-based decentralized financial system is driven by three assumptions:  preference for the Bitcoin blockchain as the base layer for other tokenized assets  demand for greater productivity of bitcoin, the asset  demand for a financial system that reflects the decentralized principles of Bitcoin  We already see strong demand signals for the Bitcoin blockchain as a base layer for other tokenized assets. The market for non-fungible tokens on Bitcoin, called Ordinals, grew from less than $100 million to over $1.5 billion in less than six months.  However, the largest opportunity is still ahead. Most of the market value of Bitcoin’s decentralized finance system will show up in the value of fungible tokens on Bitcoin. Fungible tokens will power greater productivity of bitcoin (the asset) via yield-bearing instruments and decentralized financial systems via protocols and layer 2s. Relative to Ethereum, Solana and other chains, the value of fungible tokens on Bitcoin is still minuscule, largely because we are in the early innings of programmable functionality on that blockchain.  Bitcoin’s leading non-fungible token protocol, Ordinals, wasn’t released until January 2023. BRC20s and Runes, Bitcoin’s leading fungible token protocols, were launched in March 2023 and April 2024, respectively. Even with these recent releases, additional functionality is required for a robust decentralized finance ecosystem to exist on Bitcoin.  Additional functionality is being introduced to Bitcoin in two ways:  Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs): Upgrades to Bitcoin’s core software are being pursued through BIPs, such as OP_CAT, which aims to enhance smart contract functionality and increase efficiency on Bitcoin.  Technological Developments: Innovations like BitVM, pegs and bridges are being developed to provide users with enhanced programmability and efficiency without requiring an upgrade to Bitcoin’s core software.  As previously mentioned, Bitcoin’s decentralized finance ecosystem is still in the early stages of its life cycle. However, strong indicators of future growth can be seen via growing developer and DeFi activity in the space. In 2023, 40% of Bitcoin open-source developers were focused on Bitcoin L2s and scaling solutions. Then, in the first quarter of 2024, Bitcoin ecosystem total value locked (TVL) grew over six times from $492 million to over $2.9 billion. Given these early indicators, coupled with what we’ve seen transpire across other ecosystems, we believe over $1 trillion in value could be created in the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem within the next five to 10 years.

42418016,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcG9F,1717600929,Did a Single Trump NFT Purchase Change Washington's Mind on Crypto?,"Valentin Pletnev is far from the best-known name in cryptocurrencies, but a scheduling snafu that kept him away from Donald Trump's recent Mar-a-Lago NFT gala might've dramatically rerouted U.S. cryptocurrency policy.  Only select holders of Trump's NFT collection were allowed into the exclusive May event. Pletnev snagged one of those tickets as soon as he learned of the gathering – earning it through the purchase of 100 Trump ""Mugshot Edition"" digital trading cards.  ""I thought it was hilarious because I'm not American,"" Pletnev, the German co-founder of Quasar Labs, which builds a decentralized finance protocol on the Cosmos blockchain, said in an interview with CoinDesk.  Then the gala was moved to a time when Pletnev wasn't available, so he gave his ticket to Ryan Selkis, the founder of crypto data and analytics platform Messari and a vocal pro-crypto policy advocate.  Selkis ended up on stage and touted the crypto revolution. So did Polygon's Mihailo Bjelic.  Trump gave his own full-throated endorsement of crypto at the Palm Beach, Florida estate. The former U.S. president had previously derided cryptocurrencies as playthings ""based on thin air.""  Pletnev insists that his NFT purchase – which let Selkis speak – played a key role in the events that followed: Within a few days, a vocal contingent of the crypto and blockchain industry rallied around former President Trump and then the notoriously crypto-averse U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission granted a surprise approval to the first exchange-traded funds that own Ethereum's ether {{ETH}}.  Following the gala, a widely circulated meme on X identified ""Trump NFTs"" and ""Ryan Selkis Goes to Mar-a-Lago"" as the first two dominoes to fall in a chain that ultimately culminated in the long-awaited approval of ether ETFs, a watershed moment for the melding of digital assets and traditional finance.  While some close to crypto policy say the approval was likely no matter what, others viewed it as capitulation from Joe Biden's administration – proof that the crypto industry was finally being taken seriously by both parties as a political force.  Within two days of the SEC approval, the Republican-controlled House approved the industry-friendly FIT21 bill with significant Democratic support. Then, the Democrat-controlled Senate passed a resolution to repeal SAB 121, which placed restrictions on financial institutions that custody crypto assets. The repeal was ultimately vetoed by president Biden, but it earned support from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat who had days earlier expressed skepticism towards the resolution.  ""What else must have changed [Schumer's] mind in five days,"" Pletnev asked, if not ""Ryan Selkis on stage with Trump, Trump saying 'I'm pro-crypto, crypto needs to stay in this country,' and all of Crypto Twitter realizing they might be team Trump?""  Quasar's new vision  Buoyed by the recent policy hype, Pletnev is revealing a top-to-bottom rebrand for his Quasar protocol oriented around simplifying decentralized finance, or DeFi, investing.  ""Fundamentally, crypto is only a big success if we increase the number of beneficiaries compared to traditional finance,"" Pletnev told CoinDesk. ""If we don't achieve this, we risk replacing the financial oligarchy with a technocracy, which would be a sad outcome.""  Central to Pletnev's ""Yield for All"" vision will be the introduction of layered staking assets, or LSAs, which will combine staking and DeFi yields into a single token that accrues interest.  Staking is one of the most popular DeFi strategies today. It involves parking digital assets with a blockchain to help ""secure"" it in exchange for a steady stream of interest. Frequently, users will stake assets and then re-invest them into other yield-generating DeFi platforms at the same time. Users can, for instance, stake assets into a platform like Lido, ""restake"" them into EigenLayer via a platform like EtherFi, and then borrow against their stake as a way to maximize their overall returns.  Read more: Crypto Staking 101: What Is Staking?  If this all sounds complicated, that's because it is. Quasar aims to simplify things through its LSAs—assets that represent specific trading strategies and can be traded outright. Behind each LSA will be a basket of crypto assets deployed across a variety of DeFi protocols. The assets can accrue yields from these protocols, and they will be managed according to investment strategies built into Quasar's smart contracts.  ""DeFi is complicated. If it keeps fragmenting, it becomes a full-time job,"" said Pletnev. ""We need to make DeFi work for the people by wrapping it in a simple, easy-to-use way.""  Quasar Finance launched its mainnet in 2023 as a ""decentralized asset management"" protocol based on the Cosmos blockchain ecosystem. The platform used—and will continue to use—Cosmos's Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, which facilitates interoperability across various blockchains.  Quasar's approach isn't dissimilar from existing yield protocols like Yearn, all-in-one trading platforms that simplify DeFi by deploying user funds into premade trading strategies. The current Quasar protocol operates similarly: Users can deposit crypto into ""vaults"" that follow certain investment strategies and don't require much active oversight from users.  With its LSAs, Pletnev says Quasar is taking extra steps to add fungibility, decentralization and ease of access to the platform.  Yield for All?  Despite the ""Yield for All"" pitch, Quasar, like many DeFi protocols worried about violating U.S. financial regulations, is not available for use in the United States—hence Pletnev's decision to become involved in U.S. politics.  ""I went to Draper University in the Bay Area, Tim Draper's private school,"" said Pletnev, referring to the Silicon Valley venture capitalist. ""I would not be where I am without the United States. There is no other way of phrasing it.""  ""The fact that the people of this country cannot benefit from what exists because of their country is insane to me,"" he said, ""so I bought the [Trump] NFT because I thought someone should advocate for crypto.""  Quasar Labs has raised a total of $11.5 million from investors including Polychain Capital, Blockchain Capital, HASH Capital, CIB and Shima. The most recent funding round, disclosed in January, valued the company at $70 million. The platform's QSR governance token is trading at $0.11 cents, with a fully diluted value of $67 million.

Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Sell-Side Risk Ratio Has Declined Recently In a new post on X, analyst Checkmate has discussed the recent trend occurring in the Sell-Side Risk Ratio for the Bitcoin short-term holders. The Sell-Side Risk Ratio here refers to an indicator that tells us about how the absolute profit and loss being locked in by the investors compares against the BTC Realized Cap. The Realized Cap is basically a measure of the total amount of capital that holders as a whole have used to purchase their coins, as determined by on-chain data. Related Reading: Bitcoin Not ‘Overvalued’ Yet, Says CryptoQuant CEO: Here’s Why Thus, the Sell-Side Risk Ratio, which takes the ratio between the sum of profit and loss with this initial investment, provides info about how the profit or loss-taking from the investors looks like relative to their cost basis. When the value of the indicator is high, it means the holders are realizing a large profit or loss right now. Such a trend may follow some sharp volatility in the asset’s price. On the other hand, the metric being low implies that investors are only selling coins close to their break-even level. This kind of trend could suggest profit or loss-takers in the market have become exhausted. In the context of the current topic, the entire market’s Sell-Side Risk Ratio isn’t of interest, but rather that of only a specific segment of it: the short-term holders (STHs). These investors are typically defined as those who acquired their coins within the past 155 days. The below chart shows the trend in the metric for this cohort over the past decade: As is visible in the graph, the Sell-Side Risk Ratio for the Bitcoin STHs had shot up to a very high level when the rally towards the new all-time high (ATH) had occurred earlier in the year. Historically, the STHs have shown to be the fickle-minded hands of the market, who sell easily at the sight of any FOMO or FUD in the sector. As such, it’s not surprising to see that these investors had ramped up their profit realization alongside the rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Has Solid On-Chain Cushion Below $68,900: Stage Set For Fresh Rally? Since this peak, though, the indicator has gone through a steep decline as the price of the cryptocurrency has been stuck in endless consolidation. Following the drawdown, the metric has now returned to relatively low levels. It would appear that as the tight sideways movement has occurred, sellers among the STHs have seen exhaustion. “Bitcoin is coiled like a spring, and it usually doesn’t sit still like this for long,” notes the analyst. With the asset’s price surging to $71,000 in the past day, it’s possible that this unwinding may already be here. BTC Price Bitcoin has enjoyed an increase of around 3% in the past 24 hours, which has now taken its price to $70,900.

The move was anticipated by most economists as policymakers in Canada had previously signaled satisfaction with the direction of inflation alongside some concern about slowing economic growth.  ""[It is] reasonable to expect further cuts to our policy interest rate"" if inflation continues lower, said BoC Governor Tiff Macklem in prepared remarks following the decision.  At press time, bitcoin {{BTC}} was little-changed following the news, trading at $70,500.  With its action today, the BoC becomes the first of the G-7 central banks to begin what's expected to be a cycle of easier monetary policy after a multi-year battle to cool inflation. Economists are expecting the European Central Bank to become the second of the major central banks to ease at its meeting tomorrow.  And though some members of the U.S. Federal Reserve have recently suggested that bank may hold off on any rate cuts for all of 2024, recent economic data have revealed slowdowns in both economic growth and inflation. Traders currently have priced in a near-60% chance of a rate cut either prior to or at the Fed's September meeting, according to CME FedWatch.  Other things being equal, tighter monetary policy is often a headwind for risk assets – bitcoin among them – as higher rates boost competition for investor capital.

This development is significant considering the impact that these token burns are known to have on the meme coin. Shiba Inu Burn Rate Crashes By Over 99% Data from the burn tracking website Shibburn shows that Shiba Inu’s burn rate has declined by 99.44% in the last 24 hours. Only 120,888 Shiba Inu tokens have been burned during this period, which is way low compared to the over 21 million tokens that were burned the previous day. Related Reading: Bitcoin Gets Massive $500,000 Price Tag From Billionaire, Here’s Why The instability in the number of Shiba Inu tokens burned daily continues to be a problem for the meme coin’s ecosystem. This issue is believed to be mainly due to the significant drop in the number of daily transactions on the Shibarium network. The layer-2 network is known to have contributed largely to the 76 billion Shiba Inu tokens that were burned last year. However, Shibarium hasn’t had much impact on these token burns since the start of the year with its daily transactions dropping from millions recorded last year to just a few thousand transactions as of late. This development has hindered the network from deploying a part of the transaction fees earned to Shiba Inu burns like it did last year. Meanwhile, while Shiba Inu’s burn rate has dropped by over 99%, a positive takeaway is that it has increased by almost 15% in the last seven days. This is undoubtedly a welcome development that members of the Shiba Inu community will be glad about. However, the focus remains on sustaining this trend, given the positive impact it could have on Shiba Inu’s price, especially heading into the latter stages of the bull run. SHIB Price Remains Unaffected Shiba Inu’s price is currently on an upward trend despite the decline in the burn rate. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that the meme coin is up over 8% in the last 24 hours. Shiba Inu’s trading volume is also up by over 7% in the last 24 hours, signaling investors’ bullish sentiment towards the meme coin. Related Reading: Dogecoin Social Sentiment Turns Bearish And Drops To March Levels, What This Means For Price On-chain metrics also paint a bullish picture for the meme coin. Data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock shows that Shiba Inu whales have been accumulating the meme coin in the last few days.

28968609,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=611597,1717594405,Bitcoin Volatility Reaches Historic Low: Calm Before A 500% Bullish Storm?,"Bitcoin price is back trading above $70,000 after weeks of sideways price action. The recent boredom and sideways grind, however, isn’t necessarily a bad thing. In the past, such lulls in volatility have preceded the top cryptocurrency’s greatest rallies on record. Let’s take a look. Bitcoin Historical Volatility Reaches Record Low The term volatility often has a negative connotation surrounding it. For example, Oxford Languages defines volatility as the “liability to change rapidly and unpredictably, especially for the worse.” In financial markets, the term refers to how much and how fast price moves within a specific timeframe. To measure volatility, technical analysts use the historical volatility metric, which compares volatility across the entire existence of an asset’s price timeline. Using such a tool, analysts can compare and contrast past bouts of high or low volatility in an asset like Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Soars Past $71,000: Here’s Why Turning this tool on in BTCUSD reveals that on the 2-week timeframe, the top cryptocurrency by market cap is coming off the lowest volatility phase in its entire existence. More importantly, however, is the fact that the last two times that BTCUSD was this boring, it led to an over 9,000% and over 2,000% rally. The most recent made Bitcoin a household name, rising from around $1,000 to nearly $20,000 at its peak in 2017. Now the signal is back, but what might this mean for the cryptocurrency market and holders who have waited through the recent sideways price action. Third Time Is A Charm: Can BTC Climb 200-500%? Volatility is cyclical in nature. After periods of high volatility and explosive price action, the market moves into a lull where prices move painfully sideways. When the sideways boredom ends, it usually ends with a bang and a return to the explosive price action that was evident before the lull. Volatility can also be measured and even predicted using “implied volatility.” But the direction in which the volatility releases cannot be predicted with accuracy. Considering volatility is most often associated with negativity, there’s at least some probability that the low in volatility could be broken by an extreme dump in Bitcoin. Related Reading: The Half-Million Dollar Bitcoin: Predictions Point To Monumental Price Surge In 18 Months But the last two instances suggest otherwise, and the recent trend has been up. While BTCUSD likely won’t see another 9,000% rally nor a 2,000% rally like it did in 2013 and 2017, the first-ever cryptocurrency could do anywhere from a 200% to 500% surge. At 200% and a price of $70,000 per coin, Bitcoin could end up peaking this cycle at around $140,000. At a 500% move from current levels, Bitcoin could reach $350,000 per coin. Higher multiples are indeed possible, but not probable considering the law of diminishing returns. Tony Severino, CMT is the author of the CoinChartist (VIP) newsletter. Sign up for free.

Bit Digital's mix of fleet efficiency, balance sheet position, and HPC service revenue makes it one of the better targets in my view. Based on Riot Platforms' rejected offer for Bitfarms, I can make the case BTBT should be trading closer to $3.50 per share. A 25% premium to 6/4 close. We're still less than two months removed from the long-anticipated Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) halving in late-April, and we've already seen attempts at consolidation in the public mining equities. Just days after the markets found out about a takeover bid of Bitfarms ( BITF ) by Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), HPC client-turned potential buyout suitor CoreWeave reportedly put in an offer on Core Scientific ( CORZ ). Some companies are well positioned to be buyers in a market like this, others are interesting takeover targets. I believe Bit Digital ( BTBT ) is the latter. Still Buying This Small Cap Crypto Play The Blue Chip Crypto Equity Operational Shift Taking Place? I've covered Bit Digital for Seeking Alpha several times in the last two years. It's arguably the only Bitcoin mining stock that I've been consistently long over the last 18 months. This is what I said last August: If Bitcoin is ""digital gold,"" Ethereum is arguably ""digital gas."" In my view, BTBT is a clean and easy way to wager on future adoption of both BTC and ETH outside of holding the coins directly or chasing arbitrage through the Grayscale funds. Given Bit Digital's Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) staking strategy, HPC service development, and willingness to scale without taking on a large debt burden, I've viewed BTBT as one of the better long term speculative buys in the mining industry. In this article, we'll get into why the mining industry consolidation is happening, what I think makes Bit Digital an attractive buyout candidate, and perhaps most importantly, what I think shareholders should look for in a potential offer price. The Case for Consolidation The Bitcoin halving has come and gone. While generally viewed as a bullish catalyst that greatly impacts the supply/demand dynamics from new coin issuance, the halving is not necessarily a great thing for Bitcoin miners. Unlike precious metals or base metals, mining Bitcoin has a clear calculable end. There will only ever be 21 million BTC. Between now and roughly the year 2140, the issuance of new coins will be cut in half every four years until all of the coins have been mined, and a different incentive structure will be required to secure the ledger. Data by YCharts To this point, ever diminishing rewards from mining denominated in BTC have been counteracted by the dollar-denominated price of BTC. Meaning, as the price of BTC in dollars (or any fiat for that matter) grows, the pain felt by the miners from declining coin issuance is typically mitigated. We've seen global hash power securing Bitcoin exponentially increase since the network's genesis. Miner Revenue, 7d avg (The Block) But even as Bitcoin once again challenges all-time high prices, the economics of mining BTC have dramatically changed in Q2-24. Unprofitable operations have two choices; turn off, or sell out. In my view, the bigger these unprofitable operations are, the more likely they are to attempt to merge with smaller, efficient fleet operators to grow share of network hash and trim overhead. Why Bit Digital? Bit Digital has the right combination of factors that make the company a really interesting buyout candidate in my opinion. First, the company's mining fleet is usually among the most efficient in the market. BTC per EH/s April (Author's Chart, Company filings) Even though Bit Digital's 2.8 EH/s in April was far smaller than every other company in this chart, the company's 119 BTC in the month put Bit Digital at 42.5 BTC per EH/s in April; by my calculations, this was third only behind TeraWulf ( WULF ) and Iris Energey ( IREN ). Q1-24 Revenue (Bit Digital, Form 6-k) Another reason Bit Digital is so interesting as a buyout candidate is because it's been able to meaningfully grow an HPC services business. At a little under $8.1 million in Q1-24, HPC service revenue already accounts for more than 26% of the company's total revenue so far this year. On the company's last conference call, management signaled that HPC services are going to be the company's primary driver going forward. Bit Digital's approach to scaling EH/s will be more opportunistic than ""growth at any cost,"" to paraphrase CEO Sam Tabar. Data by YCharts Finally, the balance sheet is in great shape. Bit Digital could satisfy all liabilities with the cash on the balance sheet and still have nearly $122 million in digital asset liquidity left over, per the company's April performance update: BTBT Digital Holdings (Author's Chart, Bit Digital filings) This significant stash of coins for a company valued at just $310 million could theoretically be deployed for either HPC infrastructure expansion or alternative DeFi strategies like lending or providing liquidity to DEX protocols for in-kind yield. Management indicated a preference for HODLing the Bitcoin on the balance sheet to benefit from potential price appreciation in the coin post-halving. Roughly 50% of the company's coin treasury is allocated to BTC, with most of the remaining going toward its Ethereum staking strategy. What's BTBT Worth? On the conference call, company leadership mentioned the need for raising capital to fund HPC expansion. However, it was noted that terms for AI compute are far more favorable than terms for Bitcoin mining infrastructure growth. Bit Digital is still guiding for $100 million in annualized HPC revenue. We don't yet have the company's May numbers as of article submission. But by my calculations, Bit Digital is likely in the ballpark of 21 BTC per EH/s post-halving at current efficiency numbers, which indicates somewhere between 50-60 BTC per month going forward depending on global hash and transaction fee revenue. BTC Price Mining Revenue per month Annualized $70,000 $3,500,000 $42,000,000 $80,000 $4,000,000 $48,000,000 $90,000 $4,500,000 $54,000,000 $100,000 $5,000,000 $60,000,000 Source: Author's estimates, assuming 21 BTC per EH/s and 2.8 exahash In the table above, I'm assuming the low end of that range, no mining expansion, and have plugged in 50 BTC mined per month. At the current $70k BTC price, Bit Digital is doing $42 million in annualized revenue from mining. Assuming the company hits on its $100 million HPC revenue forecast, we're looking at worst case $142 million in annual revenue. At a $100k BTC price, Bit Digital is doing $160 million in total annualized revenue and has a market capitalization under $310 million. Data by YCharts At $5.75 per share, Core Scientific's recent buyout offer from CoreWeave assigned a roughly $1 billion valuation to the company and the market reaction has indicated that price is too low. By my estimates, CORZ closed June 4th at 1.5x forward sales assuming a $100k BTC price. The Riot Platforms' offer to buyout Bitfarms valued BITF shares at $2.30. If we annualize Bitfarms' May production data of 20.8 BTC per EH/s and assume the company scales to the 21 EH/s that it's guiding for this year, BITF's $926 million market cap values the company at 1.8x forward sales at that same $100k BTC price projection. At current capacity levels, BTBT is trading at 1.9x forward sales based on my lower end estimate of 50 BTC per month and a $100k BTC price. But if we offer Bit Digital the same liberties that the market appears to be taking with BITF and price the company based on future sales figures and capacity that isn't yet operational, we get a much lower multiple. Bit Digital plans to scale to 6.0 EH/s. At 21 BTC per EH/s post halving, 6 EH/s in mining capacity, and a $100k BTC price, Bit Digital can achieve $126 million in annualized mining revenue on top of the $100 million in HPC services revenue that management is guiding for. Based on these assumptions, BTBT is trading at 1.4x forward sales at a $310 million market cap. And I'll reiterate that Bit Digital isn't servicing debt to the degree that both CORZ and BITF are at this time. In my view, the company should be trading at a forward P/S premium to each of these stocks rather than a discount. But I'd settle for even the same multiple at this point. Closing Thoughts In my opinion, BTBT should be trading closer to $3.50 per share. At the June 4th close of $2.80, I see additional upside of 25%. And some may even call this estimate conservative based on some of the higher price forecasts we've seen for BTC prices over the next 12 months. The fundamentals of Bitcoin mining changed in late-April. Many companies in this space want to pivot to high-performance compute services for secondary revenue streams. Bit Digital is already there and is an interesting speculative buy on that alone. However, given the company's mining fleet efficiency and liquidity position, I don't think it should be overlooked by larger mining peers as the industry consolidates.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4697520-bit-digital-an-under-appreciated-buyout-candidate?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/28967877.jpeg

28966469,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=611535,1717590623,Crypto Expert Reveals Top 3 Trades To Take Now,"In a video update, Miles Deutscher, a widely followed crypto expert, provided his 502,800 followers on X with an in-depth analysis of the current market conditions. This update came in response to what Deutscher described as “massive ramifications” for certain altcoins following a notable Bitcoin price surge. Deutscher began his discussion by pointing out a significant rally in Bitcoin’s price, which soared from $68,500 to over $71,000. This movement aligns with his observation of substantial inflows into Bitcoin spot ETFs, which he highlighted as nearly reaching $900 million in a single day. This figure is distributed across various funds, with Fidelity, BlackRock and ARK contributing the largest shares. “This is the highest inflow that Bitcoin has gotten since the major breakout in March,” Deutscher stated. He connected these inflows to a broader bullish sentiment in the market, suggesting that they indicate a robust institutional interest that had not been seen since Bitcoin’s previous highs around $74,000. Strategic Altcoin Play #1: BNB Ecosystem Shifting the focus to the altcoin market, Deutscher honed in on Binance Coin (BNB) and its associated tokens. He elaborated on BNB’s performance, noting its breakout to new all-time highs and its defiance of typical market gravity. He advised potential investors to consider entering positions after a definitive weekly close. Related Reading: Rumor Of Apple Partnership Sends Crypto Altcoin Soaring By 20% “When a coin is in price discovery, it’s often very hard to fade that coin. If you’re interested in a long here, wait for a close above on the weekly if you’re a higher timeframe trader, and then you have very clear invalidation for this next leg to the upside,” Deutscher said. In the BNB ecosystem, Deutscher pointed out specific tokens poised for growth, especially FLOKI and Cake. FLOKI, which gained the analyst’s nod as “one of the leading meme coins on the Binance Smart Chain,” has shown similar price actions to another meme coin, Pepe. Observing these patterns, Deutscher predicted a possible 20% upside potential for Floki following its breakout. Cake, known for its role as the largest DEX on the Binance Smart Chain, has started to show promise by reclaiming key support levels. “Cake is an interesting play. Because Cake, on the weekly chart, has been pretty unimpressive, but it’s now finally starting to show signs of wanting to reclaim that major support level, , a reclamation of that level could send it to $5.” #2 Ethereum Is Ready To Surprise A significant portion of Deutscher’s analysis was dedicated to Ethereum and the speculative impacts of the upcoming spot Ether ETFs in the United States. He discussed how Ethereum’s potential underperformance relative to Bitcoin could set up a lucrative buying opportunity ahead of the ETH ETF’s launch. Related Reading: Crypto Guru Unveils Best Altcoins To Buy Now Deutscher quoted market sentiment from various tweets, indicating a general consensus that Ethereum might underperform in ETF inflows, which he believes is an undervalued viewpoint. “Given the fact that Bitcoin is significantly upticking, the ETH inflows could surprise. And the ETH chart really hasn’t done as much as you think it would, considering they’re on the verge of a major, major catalyst ” he explained, suggesting that the market might be underestimating Ethereum’s appeal to institutional investors. #3 Crypto Trend: Real-World Assets Third, Deutscher explored the concept of real-world asset (RWA) staking as an emerging investment opportunity within the Ethereum ecosystem. He cited Ondo Finance as a leader in this area, already showing strong performance and potential for further gains. “It’s actually consolidating into another bull flag here on the 1-hourly and the 4-hourly after breaking above that $1.33 level. The price action here is absolutely absolutely amazing. It’s a thing of beauty,” Deutscher noted. He also highlighted projects like Mantra and Pendle as other key players benefiting from the shift toward RWA staking. “Mantra recently announced their staking as well. Pendle is obviously a platform to enable you to earn yield. This is a clear beneficiary. These tokens, in my opinion have been the RWA leaders, […]. All of these can perform well.” At press time, ETH traded at $3,799.

42418024,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcGKb,1717588939,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Tops $71K After Best Day for ETF Inflows Since March,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  BTC crossed $71,000 early Wednesday after spot bitcoin ETFs had their best day of inflows since March. Bitcoin has risen about 3% in the last 24 hours, while the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), representing a broad measurement of the digital asset market, is up around 2.8%. Bitcoin peaked at $71,341 at the start of the European morning, its highest since May 21. It subsequently pulled back to trade around $70,900. Nevertheless, BTC is showing a green candle for the fifth consecutive day, its longest such stretch since March.  U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs saw over $880 million in inflows on Tuesday, the most since March and the second-highest since they went live in January, provisional data shows. Fidelity's FBTC led the way with $378 million, while BlackRock's IBIT took on $270 million. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas said on X that the ETFs have taken on a net $3.3 billion in the past four weeks, with a year-to-date figure of more than $15 billion. The increased activity comes a few weeks after U.S. spot ether ETF filings were approved and amid a positive outlook for cryptocurrencies from the ongoing U.S. presidential campaign.  Bain Capital Crypto plans to start a second fund according to a filing with the SEC, more than two years after its first in March 2022. That $560 million fund launched just before the collapse of Do Kwon's luna triggered a massive rout in the crypto market. Despite the ensuing crypto winter, Bain Capital was an active investor throughout 2022 and 2023, participating in rounds such as Sam Altman's $115 million Worldcoin fundraise, privacy protocol Nocturne Labs and decentralized exchange aggregator Flood. The first fund focused on early-stage investments and liquid tokens across DeFi and Web3.  Chart of the Day  Bitcoin open interest has spiked over $2 billion since Monday to nearly $37 billion, marking the largest such increase since early April.  Over $11 billion in BTC futures bets are live on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), followed by crypto exchange Binance at $8 billion.  Open interest refers to the number of unsettled futures contracts and indicates a rise in money entering the market, usually a sign of further expected volatility.

The value locked on BNB ecosystem projects rose nearly 8%, data tracked by DefiLlama shows, led by PancakeSwap and lending application Venus. Net inflows into the ecosystem topped $2.4 million as of Wednesday morning, breaking a trend of net outflows since May 30.  While there was no immediate catalyst for BNB’s price gain, some market observers suggested several existing activities had boosted the token’s fundamentals.  “BNB's price is benefiting from years of token burns and token lock initiatives for their launchpad program,” Nick Ruck, head of growth at bitcoin yield project BitU, wrote in a Telegram message. “BNB protocols have also ramped up campaigns and activities due to cheaper gas fees and have cultivated a large and energetic user base.”  Burns are the permanent deletion of tokens from circulating supply by sending them to an address not controlled by anyone. Since 2021, these burns have been based on removing a portion of the gas fees spent on BNB Chain transactions. Nearly $400,000 of the tokens were burned in the past seven days, blockchain trackers show.  ""BNB chain is perhaps the most underrated chain in all of crypto, partly due to some anti-Binance/BNB narratives being pushed in some quarters,” said a Floki developer identified only as B. “However, from a fundamentals perspective, the BNB chain is one of the best chains to build on: it is fast, scalable, and arguably the most used chain by the majority of the non-Western world.”  BNB Chain was initially developed as Binance Smart Chain and the world's largest exchange still supports its development and funding.  “We are prioritizing the BNB chain for the Floki Trading Bot, which will be going live soon, as well as for several other products. This action has paid dividends: Floki currently has 5 times more holders on the BNB chain than ETH, and the vast majority of our community is made up of people who use the chain,” B said.",POSITIVE,BNB,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/06/05/bnb-chain-ecosystem-heats-up-as-token-hits-lifetime-high-above-710,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2500fd4c02192200b60bb10f8e85121c5b0c3f55-3786x2129.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

28963372,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=611545,1717585210,"BNB Breaks Out Of Consolidation Zone, Uptrend Persist","Recently, BNB (BNB) broke out of the consolidation area, indicating a potential significant upward trend. The fact that the token has risen beyond the $700 mark suggests that the market is recovering strongly and that traders and investors are becoming more optimistic. BNB has increased noticeably by 12% in the last 24 hours, carrying on its strong trend from the previous week and month. This breakout has drawn notice, and some analysts anticipate substantial gains if the bullish trend continues. BNB’s price was up by 3.56% as of the time of writing, trading at approximately $710, with a market capitalization of over $104 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of over $4.2 billion. In the past day, there has been a 12.73% increase in market capitalization and a 79.6% increase in trading volume. Price And Indicators Formation On BNB 4-hour And 1-day Chart As of right now, BNB is trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) with good rising momentum in the 4-hours chart. This implies that the price is still positive and there is still a possibility for price growth. The 4-hour Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) also signals that BNB might continue to move bullishly as the MACD histograms are trending above the MACD zero line. In addition, the MACD line and the MACD signal line are currently trending above the zero line with a good spread between them, suggesting that there is still room for BNB to move upward. In the daily time frame, it can be observed that BNB made a successful break out above its consolidation zone on the previous day and moved on to break its previous all-time high of $692. At this point, the price of BNB is still showing good momentum to move higher. Additionally, the 1-day MACD also displays a bullish signal as the MACD Histograms are currently trending above the MACD zero line. Also, both the MACD line and the MACD signal line are trending above the zero line with a good space between them, which indicates that BNB’s price might still move upward. Significance Of The Breakout In conclusion, since prices have broken above the consolidation zone, BNB will definitely move to create higher highs and lows if the price continues to move upward. However, if it fails to move upward, it will start to descend in the direction of the upper base of the consolidation zone for a retest. If this upper base is unable to hold the price, it will continue to move downward to test the $509 support level and might even move further to test other support levels.

BITO offers attractive dividend yields of above 20% but, this may come at the expense of price appreciation. The fund's holdings show a shift to a longer-term strategy, possibly due to expected pressure on crypto prices from miners adjusting to the halving. The ETF may experience further volatility and it is better to wait for the turbulence period to end before investing. In my last thesis on ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ) entitled “ Uptrend Likely To Continue Till Halving Amid Volatility” on March 6, I had a bullish position which materialized, but only to some extent when the share price increased from $30.83 to a peak of $33.65 one week later. However, subsequently, volatility reigned and it is now trading at around $27. Also, the chart below shows that BITO’s underperformance relative to Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) may only be getting worse raising the issue of capital preservation. Data by YCharts Against such a backdrop, this thesis aims to show that BITO is a hold for shareholders because of its dividends, but for potential investors it is better to wait for the period of turbulence to end. For this purpose, I will show how the market dynamics have changed considerably this year and compare the ETF with alternative investments that allow exposure to crypto without actually owning coins. First, I provide reasons for BITO's not sustaining its momentum after its initial upside to $33.65. Understanding the Price Action After the approval of the 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 10 by the Security and Exchange Commission, demand for the cryptocurrency did increase, but its price did not go to $79.3K according to my prediction. Instead, it only reached a peak of around $73K before sliding. One reason for this is total daily trading volumes for the 11 ETFs went down from $4.47 billion on March 6, to $2.87 billion at the end of April. Since this period also saw BTC lose 13% of its value, this means lower trading volumes was accompanied by lower crypto demand. In this respect, contrarily to BITO which holds Bitcoin futures contracts, the newly issued ETFs have to be backed by actual BTCs or require the fund managers to purchase coins on the open market. Therefore, as the price of Bitcoin suffered, it was the same for the ProShares ETF which is linked to Bitcoin as shown below. www.proshares.com A second reason explaining the underperformance of the ProShares ETF is some investors rotating away. In this respect, for those who want to get direct exposure to Bitcoin without owning a crypto exchange account or wallet, the 11 new ETFs two of which are the iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ) and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF ( FBTC ) represent alternative investments to BITO. Thus, given more choices, investors may have switched to these spot ETFs which more closely track the price of Bitcoin as charted below. Data by YCharts Moreover, the added advantage of these new funds is that their fees remain much lower than BITO's 0.95% . However, this fee is largely offset by its dividend yields of above 20% which is particularly attractive for income seekers. Generating Dividends From Investment Income and Capital Gains Looking further, it may seem weird how a fund that invests in Bitcoin-related financial derivatives (or futures ) can pay dividends. To achieve this, the fund managers sell Bitcoin futures for cash every month, generating profits or net investment income, which are then all distributed to shareholders as dividends. Furthermore, distributions are also made out of capital gains. However, as charted below, dividends tend to vary and there is no guarantee that payments will be effected every month as in September 2023 and for January and June this year. Still, its dividend yield is nearly ten times higher than the 2.57% median for all ETFs. dividends/history (seekingalpha.com) Hence, with a dividend grade of A+ together with superior momentum and liquidity scores, BITO is rated as a strong buy by Quant ratings. However, given the post-halving volatility and for those wondering whether it is the time to be positioned, it is preferable to wait as it could fall further. The Futures Held Hints at Further Downside Looking deeper into the investment income strategy, BITO's holdings on April 24 are pictured below. In this case, the 24.15% of CME Bitcoin futures, which were set to expire on April 26, tend to show that fund managers expected short-term gains, or for crypto to rise in the immediate aftermath of the halving which occurred only on April 19 . BITO Bitcoin Futures Holdings (www.proshares.com) However, this did not happen and, on the contrary, the cryptocurrency lost around 10% in April. Still, the fact that BITO paid a higher dividend of $1.68 on May 1 as charted above shows that they may have sacrificed part of the capital appreciation. This is confirmed by the fact that BITO reached a trough of $23 on the same day while, at the same time, it's significantly diverged relative to BTC as illustrated in the blue chart below. seekingalpha.com Therefore, in addition to the possibility of some investors rotating away toward Spot ETFs to get more direct exposure to the crypto, BITO's income strategy looks to have played against its price performance. Going forward, the fact that the holdings on June 4 hold futures expiring on June 28 and July 26 (above holdings picture) shows that the fund managers have shifted to a relatively longer-term strategy, possibly because they do not expect a short-term appreciation in the price of BTC. This longer-term strategy is aligned with the possibility that crypto prices will be under pressure as miners adjust to the combined halving/difficulty issues in the short term. In this respect, one factor that is pressurizing Bitcoin prices is miners offloading their treasury of HODLed BTCs to face up to the halving event which has reduced the rewards perceived for each block mined. At the same time, increasing mining difficulty makes it more time-consuming to produce the same output out of existing computing power (hash rates). Hence, they may have to liquidate about $5 billion worth of Bitcoins to fund their operating expenses which is a lot especially considering that they were mostly HODLing them before the halving event. Looking for a Floor Amid the Turbulence Miners selling crypto assets could also be motivated by an economic environment characterized by high capital costs as interest rates continue to remain above 5%. Additionally, operating costs remain high as inflation persists at above 3%. Thus, any news that raises the chances of the Federal Reserve switching to a dovish stance is welcomed by crypto enthusiasts, and this was the case on June 3 when both BTC and BITO gained more than 1% each. This followed news about manufacturing weakness which in turn led to a downward revision in GDP growth from 2% to 1.8% through May. However, making an investment merely based on the Fed cutting rates because of economic slowness amounts to speculation, as the related upside is not likely to be sustained. Moreover, Bitcoin has to appreciate sustainably as in 2023 to allow BITO to fund its distributions through trading of futures or using investment income, in a way that does not impact capital appreciation. In the absence of such a possibility at this juncture, this would mean the share price may continue to trend lower, a possibility also hinted at by the momentum indicators: the share price being lower than the 10-day and 50-day moving averages. Therefore, the price could again flirt with the $23 level last reached in May as charted below, together with a possibility that it does descend further for three reasons. First, this is the lowest price reached by BITO after the halving, which as I mentioned above, a period also synonymous with more miner-led supply. Second, inflows into the spot ETFs seem to have stabilized as mentioned earlier, which may prevent further capital outflows from BITO. Third, to counteract further downside, the fund managers have the option to fund dividends only using investment income, which seems to have been the case on June 1 when no dividend was paid, thereby not putting BITO's share price under further pressure. Chart prepared using data from (seekingalpha.com) In these circumstances, $23 can be viewed as the support price in the current turbulence period. Key Takeaways In conclusion, this thesis has shown that market dynamics have changed drastically in 2024. While 2023 was a more normal environment with Bitcoin gaining 153%, making it easier for BITO to generate investment income from futures trading to pay regular monthly, this year seems completely different. Noteworthily, the cryptocurrency has gained 56% but its path has been much more volatile, with three factors impacting the demand-supply equation, starting with the advent of spot ETFs, followed by halving without forgetting mining difficulty. To complicate matters further, the SEC has approved spot Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) ETFs which could attract up to $4.8 billion in net inflows. Now, this money could come from investors wishing to diversify away from Bitcoin as was the case during previous post-halvings, where crypto enthusiasts opted for altcoins like Ethereum at the expense of BTC for some months. Therefore, the turbulence period is likely to continue, implying that it is not the right time to invest. In such conditions, the income rationale makes a lot of sense for existing shareholders, with BITO already having paid a total of $3.9 of dividend per share this year compared to only $3.1 for the whole of last year. However, the risk is that going forward, acute volatility may prevent the fund managers from using the derivative trading mechanism to generate sufficient investment income. Finally, for those contemplating putting in new money for the long term, $23 could constitute an entry price, but bearing in mind that BITO is likely to be range-bound with an upper limit of $28.47 for some time to come, unless the Fed cut rates or Bitcoin miners rapidly adjust to the post-halving landscape.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4697502-bito-wait-for-end-of-turbulence-before-investing-rating-downgrade?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/28963117.jpeg

Market analyst Michaël van de Poppe has fueled the flames with a bold prediction: a potential 2-5x surge for NOT against Bitcoin (BTC) within the next four months. Related Reading: Banks Bust, Bitcoin Booms: Price Skyrockets 40% During US Banking Crisis From Underdog To Market Mover Notcoin entered the scene with a bang, skyrocketing 600% in just a few weeks. Analysts attribute this initial surge to exchange listings on major platforms like Binance and OKX, which injected significant liquidity and investor interest. While Bitcoin maintained a characteristically stable posture, Notcoin exhibited dramatic price swings. At one point, Notcoin’s daily trading volume even surpassed Ethereum’s, a testament to its newfound popularity. #Altcoins are going to do well, and I think $NOT has been signalling a lot. I’m suggesting that many of these can be doing a 2-5x against Bitcoin in the coming four months. Which ones are you holding in your portfolio? — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) June 4, 2024 Bullish Indicators: A Trader’s Paradise? Notcoin’s allure extends beyond its recent price action. The token boasts a sky-high 24-hour funding APR of 30%, a figure that dwarfs those of established players like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This astronomical interest rate incentivizes traders to hold onto Notcoin positions within perpetual futures contracts, suggesting a market brimming with bullish sentiment. Furthermore, Notcoin’s impressive trading volume hints at a highly liquid market, potentially attracting investors seeking quick entry and exit points. 🚀 The trading volume for $NOT is huge, hitting $16.33 billion!

Substance Despite the optimistic outlook, a note of caution is warranted. Analyst predictions, while valuable insights, are not guarantees. The cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile, and unforeseen events can trigger dramatic price reversals. While Notcoin’s association with a popular Telegram game initially fueled its rise, questions remain about its long-term utility and ability to carve out a sustainable niche within the ever-evolving crypto landscape. Notcoin Price Forecast Meanwhile, the current price prediction for Notcoin indicates a substantial projected increase of nearly 230%, forecasting the price to reach $0.073 by July 5, 2024. This bullish outlook is supported by several technical indicators, which collectively suggest a strong upward momentum. Related Reading: Is This The Next Meme Stock Frenzy?

The Fear & Greed Index, currently at 75, indicates a state of greed, signifying that investors are more inclined to buy rather than sell, further fueling the positive price action. Such a high index value typically correlates with overbought conditions, but it can also imply strong market optimism. Analyzing Notcoin’s recent performance, it has experienced green days in 55% of the last 30 trading days, which reinforces the bullish sentiment. This indicates that more than half of the days have seen price increases, suggesting a consistent upward trend.

The Binance exec has been detained in Nigeria for nearly three months and may be suffering from Malaria.  A group of U.S. lawmakers asked President Joe Biden to bring back Tigran Gambaryan, the Binance executive who has been detained in Nigeria for almost three months.  Michael McCaul (R-Texas), the House Foreign Affairs Committee chair, along with 11 other leaders, sent a letter to Joe Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger D. Carstens.  In the letter, they urged the president to treat Gambaryan's case as a hostage situation and bring him back to the U.S. Gambaryan is a U.S. citizen and Binance’s head of compliance.  “We fear for his life. Immediate action is essential to ensure his safety and preserve his life. We must act swiftly before it is too late,” they said.

This rally appears to be primarily fueled by robust inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs, with the sector experiencing its 16th consecutive day of net inflows. Why Is The Bitcoin Price Up Today? Yesterday alone, these ETFs saw an inflow of $886.6 million, with Fidelity leading at $378.7 million—setting a new record for the fund. BlackRock wasn’t far behind, with substantial inflows totaling $274.4 million. Other significant contributions included Ark with $138.7 million, Bitwise at $61 million, and the Grayscale Bitcoin and VanEck Bitcoin Trust recording $28.2 million and $4 million respectively. Good morning fellow hodlers, We had an absolute insane day of inflows yesterday with $886.6 million of inflows (that’s ~12 500 BTC) Fidelity did $378.7 million, Blackrock did $274.4 million, Ark did $138.7 million and Bitwise 61 million. Even $GBTC had inflows worth of $28.2… pic.twitter.com/KaDdmTrq9p — WhalePanda (@WhalePanda) June 5, 2024 The sustained interest is further evidenced as BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF surpassed $20 billion in assets, becoming the fastest ETF to reach this milestone, reflecting significant momentum and investor enthusiasm. Related Reading: Best Long-Term Bitcoin Buy Signal Flashes, Hedge Fund CEO Warns Eric Balchunas, a Bloomberg ETF analyst, emphasized the scale of these inflows, stating, “Fidelity not messing around, big-time flows all around today for The Ten, nearly $1b in total. Second best day ever, since Mid-March. $3.3b in past 4wks, net YTD at $15b (which was top end of our 12mo est). The ‘third wave’ is turning into a tidal wave.” Despite the positive inflow dynamics, Byzantine General (@ByzGeneral), a prominent crypto analyst, observed that the price surge could have been more pronounced. He highlighted the presence of substantial passive supply on spot exchanges, which might have tempered the price increase. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Zombies’ Awaken: Dormant Coins Move For First Time In Years, What’s Going On? He noted yesterday, “High volume today, and the perps basis actually went down a bit. I think that we got good ETF flows today, but… They’re buying into a lot of passive supply on spot exchanges.” He further commented today, “What did I say, big ETF inflows. But because of all of the passive supply it’s like an unstoppable force colliding with an immovable object.” Moreover, it’s important to note that the price increase was not driven by the liquidation of short positions in the BTC futures market, which saw only $27.58 million in shorts liquidated in the last 24 hours, according to Coinglass data. However, Willy Woo, a renowned on-chain analyst, warned that a continued rise could trigger a significant short squeeze. Woo said via X, “Tapping 72k is the fuse that’s set to start a liquidation cascade. $1.5b of short positions ready to be liquidated all the way up to $75k and a new all time high.” At press time, BTC traded at $71,075.

While some predict a stratospheric rise to $1 million per coin, fueled by economic woes, others remain skeptical. Related Reading: Is This The Next Meme Stock Frenzy? ROAR Explodes Over 300% After Kitty’s GME Move Banking On Bitcoin’s Rise? Bitcoin advocates see it as a beacon of stability in a storm. Unlike traditional assets tied to the health of institutions, Bitcoin boasts a finite supply and decentralized nature. This, they argue, positions it perfectly to benefit from a “flight to safety” scenario, where investors seek refuge from a potentially collapsing banking system. The recent history seems to support this narrative. In March 2023, the failures of prominent institutions like Silicon Valley Bank coincided with a 40% surge in Bitcoin’s price within a week. Industry figures point to this as evidence of Bitcoin’s role as an “uncorrelated asset class” – a hedge against traditional financial turmoil. Further bolstering this argument is the latest report by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The report paints a concerning picture, highlighting a worrying trend of unrealized losses on securities held by US banks. These losses, driven by rising interest rates, have ballooned to over $500 billion. Additionally, the number of banks on the FDIC’s “Problem Bank List” has grown from 52 to 63 in just one quarter, raising fears about the overall health of the sector. Million-Dollar Dream Or Flight Of Fancy? While the potential for Bitcoin to gain value seems undeniable, the ambitious price target of $1 million faces strong headwinds. Experts warn that such a dramatic surge might come at the cost of a full-blown economic meltdown, a scenario that wouldn’t necessarily benefit Bitcoin in the long run. Furthermore, Bitcoin’s historical correlation with other assets is not static. While periods of weak correlation exist, there have also been instances of strong correlation, particularly during broader market downturns. This casts doubt on Bitcoin’s ability to completely decouple itself from a struggling traditional financial system. Related Reading: Dogecoin Under The Microscope – Historical Data Points To Rebound Another factor to consider is the recent uptick in the M2 money supply, a metric representing the total money circulating in the economy. Historically, periods of M2 expansion have coincided with Bitcoin price increases. However, the interplay between money supply and Bitcoin in an environment with a potentially shaky banking system remains an open question. The Road Ahead For Bitcoin Bitcoin’s future is a bit of a guessing game right now. Banks in the US are having some problems, and that could make Bitcoin more valuable. But if the whole economy goes downhill, even Bitcoin might suffer. So, it all depends on how bad things get with the banks and the economy in general.

42418029,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcGOj,1717558500,What's Next for FIT21? (A Consensus 2024 Recap),"CoinDesk held its annual Consensus conference in Austin, Texas last week, where we heard from lawmakers and regulators, developers, company execs and all sorts of other people in and around this sector. One topic of discussion: the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act. Its passage through the House sent a surge of excitement through the crypto industry as a sign of progress, even if it's not likely to become law just yet.  And on another note, I wanted to thank everyone who said hi to me at Consensus last week. It was great seeing all of you.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Next steps  The narrative  Reps. Patrick McHenry and Tom Emmer, and Sen. Ron Wyden weighed in on the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) during their various sessions last week.  Why it matters  One major topic of discussion was the House's passage last month of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, a market structure bill that would, if signed into law, dramatically reshape the regulatory frameworks governing crypto businesses and operations in the U.S. This bill's chances – any bill's, really – of moving through the Senate are slim.  Breaking it down  Moving a bill through the Senate is a complex process. As CoinDesk has reported before, the Senate may want to start from scratch on a market structure bill, meaning it would have to go through a full committee process.  Even if the current version of the bill goes to the floor, the Senate is likely to change provisions or other aspects of the bill, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) told the audience last week. In that event, the bill would move back to the House.  ""Right now my best bet would be if we get this done this year, it's probably more likely during the lame duck once the dust settles and everybody who's wearing their jerseys now recognizes we got to get moving on,"" he said.  Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), who chairs the Financial Services Committee, said he expects legislation to be signed within the next year, pointing to the sheer amount of support FIT21 received (279 votes in favor).  ""The White House not issuing a veto threat on FIT21 was helpful and good, and it shows that they want to be at the table and policy here,"" he said. ""The Senate is a more complicated beast. It always is.""  The next step for the bill's proponents, he said, is to reach out to Senators about the legislation.  ""If we can get two-thirds of the House to vote for this bill, they should be able to get two-thirds of the Senate to vote for this bill or something very similar,"" he said.  Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), one of the Democrat lawmakers who voted to overturn the Security and Exchange Commission's Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, said of FIT21 that ""what you really need is a regulatory framework.""  ""That's what Chairman McHenry is trying to do,"" he said. ""You need to be tough on the scamsters, and the rip off artists.""  ""It's unclear how far that bill will move, but I think Chairman McHenry is right to establish a kind of regulatory framework and put a sharper focus on fighting fraud and ripoff artists,"" he said.  Over the next few weeks, this newsletter will include transcripts from some of the conversations held at Consensus.

28943516,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=611449,1717552856,BNB ‘Extremely Bullish’: Analyst Targets $1000 Breakout As It Hits New Yearly High,"Binance Coin (BNB), the native token of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, has experienced a notable surge of 7% within the past 24 hours. This upward movement reflects the overall positive trend in the market and places BNB ahead of the top five cryptocurrencies in terms of performance. Interestingly, an important milestone has been achieved as BNB surpassed its previous yearly high of $645 from March, as the token reached a high of $673 as of Tuesday. BNB Primed For Bullish Surge To $1,000? Renowned market expert “Sheldon The Sniper” believes that BNB is positioned to be one of the leading altcoins in the ongoing bull market, with a target of $1,000 if the current uptrend continues. Expressing an optimistic outlook, Sheldon states that Binance’s token “is looking extremely bullish” and is expected to surpass its previous all-time high of $686, which was reached in May 2021, despite being currently down 2.2% from that level. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Massive Solana Price Crash Using Elliott Waves Another crypto analyst known as Kaleo draws attention to the distractions surrounding Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) and emphasizes that BNB is on the verge of entering a “phase of price discovery.” Kaleo reminds that BNB played a significant role as an early leader in the previous bull market, suggesting a potential repetition of history in the current market cycle. During the 2021 bull market, BNB experienced substantial growth of 50% in late 2021. In addition, following the exchange’s CEO Changpeng Zhao’s conviction in April, the regulatory scrutiny surrounding Binance has significantly reduced. This positions the crypto platform and its native token favorably to capitalize on anticipated institutional inflows and a surge in trading volume. Trading Volume Soars To $2 Billion, Market Cap Hits $100 Billion Data from CoinGecko reveals a substantial 15% increase in BNB’s trading volume over the past 24 hours, reaching an impressive $2.3 billion compared to the previous day’s trading session. The market capitalization of Binance Coin currently stands at $102 billion, indicating a notable uptrend as it has gained over $6 billion within a 24-hour period, highlighting the renewed interest and inflow of capital from investors. The sustainability of BNB’s uptrend remains uncertain, and it is crucial to monitor key levels in various potential scenarios, including sustained bullish momentum or a price correction. If the bullish trend continues, the next significant resistance levels in the BNB/USD daily chart are at $671 and $676. These levels represent three-year hurdles for the token and must be overcome for further upward movement. Conversely, it is essential for bulls to defend the $633 level, as a breach between this support level and the current price of $668 could result in a significant loss of gains if a retest occurs.

This movement coincides with Bitcoin’s price once again reclaiming the $70,000 mark, a dynamic that has not only captured the attention of investors but also sparked analysis from on-chain analytics experts. Related Reading: Bitcoin Gets Massive $500,000 Price Tag From Billionaire, Here’s Why Revival Of The Sleeping Giants The data revealed by CryptoQuant illuminates a surprising trend: on June 2 alone, roughly 2,800 BTC that had been idle for two to three years were transferred. The following day, a movement of 4,500 BTC, dormant for four to five years, outstripped this. The activity didn’t stop there; even BTC that had not moved for over a decade—210 BTC, to be precise—changed hands. This phenomenon, referred to as “old coins moving” by a CryptoQuant author, Maartunn, suggests an “allocation” phase, where long-term holders begin to release their coins back into circulation. Particularly, according to Maartunn, old coins moving indicates a potential shift from holding to “distribution,” a sign often seen in mature bull markets. This resurgence of old BTC is notable, as it aligns with historical price peaks, including BTC’s previous rally to a new peak in March. And another 2,123 $BTC with the same age. Old coins moving, after old coins moving, after old coins moving. In other words, distribution. 😉https://t.co/BBg4e9pNoz https://t.co/zXtjrZ78Y6 pic.twitter.com/bKJgDzAIF0 — Maartunn (@JA_Maartun) June 3, 2024 A Signal Of Bullish Trends The movement of these long-dormant coins is more than a mere statistic; it reflects a broader sentiment among Bitcoin holders. According to another CryptoQuant contributor, Onchained, during bullish market phases, it is common for long-term holders to offload parts of their holdings as prices rise. This pattern is currently evident as Bitcoin continues to test major resistance levels. Moreover, Onchained further revealed that despite recent market fluctuations, the consistent increase in Bitcoin held in unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) for over three years suggests a strong bullish sentiment persists among veteran investors. The analyst further noted: The 1-year+ and 2-year+ cohorts have ceased selling, transitioning from a distribution phase to a holding phase. This change indicates a renewed confidence in Bitcoin’s future price potential, as these cohorts choose to retain their holdings rather than liquidate them at current prices. Adding to the complexity of Bitcoin’s market dynamics is the recent decline in miner reserves, hitting a 14-year low, reminiscent of the early days of Bitcoin when Satoshi Nakamoto was still active. This decrease in miner holdings could presage a tightening of Bitcoin supply, potentially accelerating a supply crunch.

28939276,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=611387,1717545616,"Crypto Analyst Forecasts A 4,000% XRP Price Run To $30, Here’s When","Despite the unimpressive XRP price action, this crypto analyst has predicted that the crypto token could witness a God candle that will send its price to unprecedented heights. The analyst also suggested when this parabolic move will happen. XRP Price To Rise To $30 Soon Enough Crypto analyst DustyBC shared a chart on his X (formerly Twitter) platform in which he predicts that XRP will experience a God candle that will send its price to 30, representing about a 4,000% price gain for the crypto token. Interestingly, the crypto token suggested that this move will happen sometime this year. Related Reading: Bitcoin, Ethereum On Exchanges Drop To New Lows, What A Supply Squeeze Would Mean For The Market DustyBC’s prediction is based on a symmetrical triangle, showing how XRP has been consolidating for years and is well primed for a breakout. Given how lengthy this consolidation has been (since 2017), the analyst believes that such a parabolic rise is possible. Crypto analyst CasiTrades also thinks that XRP can record such price gains. She mentioned in an X post that XRP is about to “complete its 2245-day triangle,” which could present a chance of a lifetime. She had previously raised the possibility of XRP rising to as high as $80 when it breaks out of the consolidation triangle. CasiTrades also recently mentioned that XRP had consolidated even further over the past few days, claiming that a breakout was imminent. The crypto analyst also alluded to XRP’s “interesting” Relative Strength Index (RSI) as another reason to be bullish on the crypto token. She acknowledged that XRP’s price hasn’t changed much but noted that there are signs for an imminent breakout. Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto also recently revealed that XRP’s RSI has dropped to its lowest in history while highlighting how bullish this was for the crypto token. XRP currently has a low RSI, which suggests that the crypto token is undervalued and could rise soon enough to attain its fair value. Meanwhile, Egrag charted two paths that XRP could follow as it rises to a price target of $7.5. XRP Is About To Make A Name For Itself Crypto analyst Javon Marks recently suggested that XRP is about to go parabolic, stating, “If XRP hasn’t already made a name for itself, it sure looks as if it’s about to do so now.” He made this statement while revealing a Hidden Bullish Divergence that had formed on XRP’s chart. He claimed that XRP saw a price gain of over 63,000% in less than one year the last time this setup formed on the charts. The crypto analyst added that such price gain is possible again, with XRP currently at its breaking point. Marks had previously predicted that XRP could enjoy a 33,000% price gain, sending it above $200. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Rise 150% From Here?
