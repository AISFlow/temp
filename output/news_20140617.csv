42377375,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70VJr,1403042710,US Judge Approves Mt. Gox's Chapter 15 Bankruptcy Filing,"The Chapter 15 US bankruptcy filing submitted by defunct bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox won approval in a Dallas court today as part of a move that will send proceedings to Japanese courts for further deliberation.  The case update, while largely procedural, should empower Japanese courts to take a greater oversight into the case, including any proposed restructuring plans.  Bloomberg Businessweek  summed up the importance of the decision, writing:  ""The ruling empowers the company’s Japanese trustee to examine witnesses, gather and review evidence and oversee assets in the US, such as servers.""  Mt. Gox KK, the exchange’s Japanese entity, first filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy in March. The filing does not protect other exchange entities such as Mt. Gox parent company Tibanne KK and CEO Mark Karpeles.  Possible revival plan update ahead  Mt. Gox's Japanese bankruptcy trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi has previously said that the US bankruptcy filing approval was necessary so he could exert more influence on the case and vet any revival plans.  In addition to Sunlot Holdings, Seattle-based bitcoin incubator CoinLab and Chinese exchange OKCoin have both been rumored to be seeking participation in the upcoming bidding process, though neither have confirmed such interest.  As recently as May, however, Kobayashi suggested that he is not currently considering any investor proposals – including the Sunlot Holdings bid – due to the nascent stage of the court proceedings. Additionally, it is not clear when such a review will take place.  Case enters fourth month  Though the exchange originally filed with the goal of restructuring the company, this plan was put to rest in a Tokyo court, which denied the company the ability to restructure, sending Mt. Gox to liquidation earlier this year.  At the time, Kobayashi was appointed as bankruptcy trustee, though most developments in the fast-moving case have been occurring in the US, the site of the only active revival attempt and early legal hearings.  In February, Mt Gox sought protection from Japanese courts after falling into bankruptcy, and a month later was granted preliminary protection in the US under Chapter 15 of its bankruptcy code, giving it certain protections from creditors.  Even in spite of any revival plan or stay of action against the company's primary corporate entity, lawyers for the international class of former exchange users suggest they will pursue continuing action against CEO Karpeles and Tibanne KK.

42377392,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70VYx,1403038819,500 Million Dogecoins Mined by Unknown Hacker in Malware Attack,"An unknown hacker has reaped an estimated 500 million dogecoins – worth nearly $200,000 at today's prices – by hacking into a series of data storage hubs for computer networks, according to SecureWorks, an information services subsidiary of personal computing giant Dell.  The SecureWorks report revealed that the hacker targeted network attached storage (NAS) boxes made by Taiwan-based Synology Inc. and used its computing power to mine dogecoin through a private pool. The action caused problems for Synology’s customers, some of whom reported poor performance on Facebook in February.  SecureWorks called the months-long intrusion unprecedented, saying:  ""To date, this incident is the single most profitable, illegitimate mining operation.""  Following reports of an issue, the investigators ultimately discovered a folder entitled ‘PWNED’ that contained the mining software CPUMiner and the capacity to conceal the program.  The address the mined dogecoins were being sent to was also identified, revealing the accumulation of more than 400 million dogecoins. Along with another wallet, the hacker generated roughly 500 million dogecoins between January and April.  In addition to exploring the technical aspects of the attack, SecureWorks delved into the possible identity of the assailant, suggesting that ""the findings strongly indicate that the threat actor is of German descent"".  Hacker used private pool  The configuration file of the software that was infecting Synology’s NAS boxes pointed to the presence of hidden mining software. CPUMiner, the program used, had been modified to run on the boxes and was connecting to a dogecoin pool not associated with any public mining group, SecureWorks said. Each NAS box acted as an individual miner, connecting to the pool and generating dogecoins.  SecureWorks accessed the data being sent to the NAS boxes, which allowed them to ascertain the dogecoin wallet address holding the fraudulently mined dogecoins, as well as the possible identity of the hacker.  Dubbed ""foilo.root3"" in the configuration file, the user appears to have a connection with accounts on GitHub and BitBucket, although it remains unclear whether the name is unique to a single person.  Mining malware gains  The dogecoin mining attack represents one of the more creative approaches to generating digital currency through fraudulent means. Other recent attempts have found wrongdoers using unique means to upload software to mine bitcoin, but in nearly all cases, the program was designed to conceal itself and its operations.  Last month, unknown hackers attempted to distribute bitcoin mining malware through a modified torrent file of the video game Watch Dogs. This attack was notable as it targeted another form of online piracy.  A more unusual concealed attempt to create mining botnets out of mobile phones was uncovered in April. At the time, a group of wallpaper apps listed on the Google Play app store were discovered to contain bitcoin mining programs and were subsequently removed.

42377393,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70VbT,1403036109,Argentinian Bitcoin Merchant Processor BitPagos Raises $600k,"Argentina and Palo Alto-based bitcoin merchant processing service BitPagos has announced its first seed funding round, raising $600,000 from a list of investors that includes Pantera Capital, venture capitalist Tim Draper, SecondMarket CEO Barry Silbert and the Boost Bitcoin Fund, among others.  BitPagos emerged out of the Boost VC accelerator in 2013 and raised more than $150,000 during its first year of operations. Unlike US merchant processors such as Coinbase or BitPay, BitPagos allows users to sell bolivars or pesos for bitcoin, as opposed to converting their bitcoin earnings into fiat currency.  BitPagos CEO Sebastian Serrano framed the latest funding round as one that will help the growing company expand its business beyond Argentina's fast-growing market.  Serrano explained:  ""We now have a better understanding of our clients and we're going to use this money to keep improving the platform, but more importantly to expand our business to more countries.""  Speaking to CoinDesk, venture capitalist Tim Draper lauded BitPagos and its efforts to increase bitcoin adoption, saying:  ""They have identified bitcoin as a currency that is more stable than the Argentinian peso [, and developed a] great solution for hotels and restaurants.""  Paul Veradittakit, senior venture associate at Pantera Capital, echoed this sentiment, stating: ""BitPagos provides stability and efficiency where merchants face high credit card fees and inflation"".  Others investors in the round include 8capita, Latin America-based firms South Ventures and NXTP Labs, as well as several unnamed angel investors.  Road to $1m in processing  Though Serrano noted that his firm is already processing $150,000 in fiat-to-bitcoin transactions per month, he is ambitious that this total will increase soon, adding that he ""would like to get to $1m monthly in the coming months"".  Still, Serrano acknowledged that educating Latin American merchants about the benefits of bitcoin remains a challenge, one that isn't as easy as it is in more tech-savvy markets like the US.  He explained:  ""In Latin America, we have characteristics that make things very different. Here if [a bitcoin exchange] gets banking, they can only rely on it so much for their operations. Not all their clients will be able to make deposits and get payout that way.""  Serrano also expressed the need for his business to continue providing a quality service in the face of these obstacles, stating:  ""We are one of the few companies trying to do fiat-to-bitcoin payments, and we want to specialze in processing US dollar payments and paying in bitcoin. When you're looking for a company to do bitcoin payments, you think of our service.""  Enrollments ahead  Of course, for BitPagos, expanding will mean signing up new merchants and building out its presence in countries such as Brazil, Chile and Ecuador, while adding new clients in other areas.  While BitPagos may not have marquee names using its service such as DISH, Expedia or Overstock, he says the size of the local businesses seeking bitcoin solutions is on the rise, adding:    ""We're seeing more and more adoption, and we are having bigger businesses, so I think it's going to be catching up really fast.""            One reason is that Serrano believes bitcoin's core value proposition is appealing to local merchants, as he says it gives them a way to hedge against inflation, makes cross-border payments easier and increases the flexibility by which they can move money.  Latin America on the rise  The latest funding is particularly noteworthy in the context of recent developments in Argentina – which has seen rapid uptake in bitcoin use – and Latin America.  In recent weeks, payments processor AstroPay launched the region's first Ripple gateway, while Latin America-focused bitcoin exchange Bitex.la raised $2m in funding to improve access to the digital currency by enabling fiat buying.  In light of this news, Serrano is still cautiously optimistic about the future and the role the region will play in wider bitcoin adoption.  He concluded: ""I think it's a big time, but the ecosystem is still learning what works and what doesn't in Latin America"".

42377386,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70VSf,1403030119,"KnCMiner Unveils First 20nm Neptune Chips, Sets Shipping Date","Swedish cryptocurrency mining hardware developer KnCMiner has announced that it has received the first batch of Neptune ASICs, which are the world’s first 20nm mining ASIC designs.  The company said in a 17th June blog post that this initial batch is currently undergoing testing and optimization. The first products based on the new chips are expected to ship this week, it added.  KnCMiner also announced that its preliminary estimates on hashing output and power consumption were accurate, stating:  ""We've reached our initial targets on speed and power consumption. But, as this is the first day we’ve had the Neptune in our lab our technicians have already implemented a few tricks to increase hashing speed and we’ll release updates to our firmware shortly.""  First to 20nm  The design of the Neptune was finalised earlier this year, with the chips undergoing a tape-out on schedule. The Neptune ASIC is loosely based on the Jupiter design, featuring 1440 cores in a 55mm x 55mm package. However, the company has stopped short of disclosing the actual die size.  Neptune’s biggest selling point has little to do with the architecture or die size – it is all about the new 20nm manufacturing process. Thanks to the new process and the resulting reduction in die and transistor size, the company says the Neptune can deliver substantial power efficiency improvements over the current generation of Jupiter ASICs.  The company explained:  ""Using the speed offered by a true 20nm die process each Neptune churns out more than 3 TH/s while consuming only 2.1 KW at the wall. That works out to 0.7 watts per GH/s or less.""  Most mining ASICs on the market today are 28nm or 40nm designs, and it is interesting to note that KnC’s ‘process lead’ extends beyond the mining niche. Intel currently holds the process lead in the x86 space, with its 22nm Haswell processors, while AMD’s latest Kaveri APUs are 28nm parts.  The same is true of ARM-based mobile processors used in most phones and tablets and graphics processors (GPUs). Most are 28nm designs and the first 20nm products are expected later this year, or in early 2015.  Fresh software to match  In addition to new Neptune hardware, KnCMiner developers are also working on software updates designed to make the most of the company’s new chips.  KnC says the updates to its firmware will be released shortly, but it also adds that its technicians have already implemented “a few tricks” to increase hashing speed.  Back in April, KnCMiner started offering incentives for early adopters who were not willing to wait for their pre-ordered Neptune rigs. The first two batches of Neptune miners sold out fast, and the company now says batch three is available for pre-order.  The company expects to start fulfilling batch 1 pre-orders this week, while batch 2 miners should start shipping before the end of the month.

42377390,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70VWR,1403020495,"TigerDirect Expands Bitcoin Payments to Canada, Mobile Devices","Technology retailer TigerDirect has announced that it is now accepting bitcoin payments via its Canadian e-commerce portal TigerDirect.ca and on all of its tablet and mobile websites.  The company first announced that it would take bitcoin payments in January. At the time, TigerDirect said it was interested in offering its customers innovative methods of payment. Since then, TigerDirect has reported more than $1m in bitcoin-denominated sales as of early March.  TigerDirect is partnering with BitPay for the Canadian rollout, according to a statement from the company.  Steven Leeds, TigerDirect’s marketing director, told CoinDesk the demand was high for bitcoin payments from Canadian customers:  ""The demand has remained constant with bitcoin purchasing on our TigerDirect.com site. The demand has not just been in products, it's also been in social outreach. We've been in contact with our reddit community, and they've been asking us when this was going to be rolled out in Canada.""  All of the site's customers can also now make purchases in bitcoin through the retailer's tablet and mobile websites.  Leeds added: ""This is new for the US and Canada, we've rolled [bitcoin payments] out across all of our other platforms"".  Positive community response  The news about the company’s decision to bring bitcoin to its Canadian service went public during a reddit Ask Me Anything session held by TigerDirect today. Prior to the start of the Q&A session, several community members quickly asked whether the company was planning such a move.  The highest-rated question on the reddit AMA addressed the query, and was eventually updated with TigerDirect’s jubilant answer: “HOW DOES RIGHT NOW SOUND??” The response elicited excitement from participating community members.  One user suggested that bitcoin integration would enable Canada’s technology enthusiasts to acquire mining parts more easily when paying with digital currency, rather than driving into the US to pick up their hardware.  TigerDirect strengthens bitcoin support  Notably, the move to accept bitcoin on more of its offerings confirms an earlier suggestion that the company was actively considering bitcoin integration for its Canadian operations.  TigerDirect first hinted in April that it was looking into adding bitcoin payments for its Canadian customers. At the time, a temporary website header suggested that the company’s TigerDirect.ca portal would begin taking bitcoin payments by encouraging customers to ""stay tuned"".  When asked whether the company had more in store for digital currencies, Leeds suggested that TigerDirect has a ""long-term roadmap"" in regards to bitcoin, stating:  ""TigerDirect is the only true omnichannel company in our industry, we have [business-to-business] B2B, retail and online, so next steps going forward are rolling it out, once we find the right partners, for our B2B and retail.""

42377400,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70Vhl,1403019994,Bit-Wallet Launches Italy's First Home-Grown Bitcoin ATM,"A new brand of bitcoin ATM from Italy is tested and ready for shipping worldwide, says manufacturer Bit-Wallet, which produced the machine in cooperation with Italy's first cryptocurrency consultancy agency, CoinCapital.  The ATM's compact size, price and feature set look ready to challenge Lamassu’s machines, which have proliferated in cafes and showrooms around the world since launching in October of last year.  Like Lamassu, Bit-Wallet says its devices also have the option to be bi-directional, meaning users can buy bitcoins and also sell them for cash. This makes the devices more like 'traditional' ATMs, which have deposit and withdrawal functions, rather than bitcoin vending machines.  Specs and price  The Bit-Wallet ATM's total weight (minus cash) is 20kg and its cash reader can be programmed to accept any paper currency. Like most other bitcoin ATMs, the machine connects to the Internet via Wi-Fi.  The price for a one-way 'buy-bitcoins-only' ATM is €3,100 (plus sales tax and shipping) making it fairly competitive with rivals. Bit-Wallet says will ship orders anywhere in the world, providing local regulations do not restrict the machines.  Prices for the bi-directional version are available from Bit-Wallet on request, and are currently pre-order only.  Demonstration tour  Bit-Wallet's Stefano Mezzetti said the company demonstrated the ATM at the recent 'Bitcoin. The Revolution Has Started' event in Milan, which was also organized in collaboration with CoinCapital, along with Mapendo, at the local business accelerator Working Capital (WCAP).  The ATM will now move to the Working Capital location in Rome.  CoinCapital in Italy  CoinCapital's Sebastiano Scrofina said his company carries out both hardware and software development for a number of clients, and was recently asked to develop an entire altcoin for one of them.  The company also engages in lobbying and advocacy activities. It organized the first bitcoin hearing for a dozen lawmakers and high-level institutions at Italy's parliament on 11th June – which Scrofina said was productive – and is also in talks with Italian banks to help them understand the concept of block chain technologies.  CoinCapital also translated Benjamin Guttmann's The Bitcoin Bible into Italian, which will be available across the country within days.

42377397,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70VfF,1403013270,Realex Payments CEO: Bitcoin is a Catalyst for Change in the Industry,"The radical new technology underpinning digital currencies enables fast, cheap, peer-to-peer payments and offers users a financial freedom impossible just a few years ago.  As a result, traditional financial institutions have been somewhat shaken up, even admitting that they may have to adapt to survive.  However, one area of finance has been more receptive to the benefits of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies: payments.  As a number of bitcoin payments companies sprung up to serve the growing user base of this new technology, mainstream commercial payments providers like Mollie, Stripe, Shopify and Digital River have added bitcoin to their list of options, alongside credit cards, PayPal and so on.  Sign of the times  Next month's Bitcoin Finance (Bitfin) conference in Dublin, Ireland – which aims to bring together the ""brightest minds in payments, finance, business, banking and bitcoin"" – is a sign of this sea change that is becoming apparent in the world of money.  Unusually for a bitcoin conference, the speakers and attendees are not all from bitcoin-based companies – or at least not yet. One such speaker is Colm Lyon, CEO of Realex Payments.  Headquartered in Dublin, Realex Payments is one of Europe’s largest and fastest-growing online payment gateways, processing payments valued in excess of €28bn ($37.9bn) per annum on behalf of around 13,000 retailers throughout Europe.  The company works closely with major brands such as Virgin Atlantic, Aer Lingus, Paddy Power and AA Insurance to deliver its online payment process.  CoinDesk spoke to Lyon to find out why the head of a fiat currency-based payments company is talking at, and even sponsoring, what is ostensibly a bitcoin conference.  For many decades, explained Lyon, the payments industry has been dominated by legacy, legacy rules, systems, businesses and people. In the meantime, technology has advanced at rapid pace and created a payments/technology gap. He added:  ""Bitcoin is far more than a currency, it is a catalyst to change in the payments industry – that’s why we are sponsoring and speaking at this important event.""  While, on the surface, the payments landscape may seem very competitive, in reality, Lyon believes, there is still a long way to go.  ""Many of the innovations of today are new applications sitting on top of existing structures such as the card schemes,"" he said. ""Competition is the key to innovating, it is the single most important factor in making efficiencies and getting organisations to move.""  ""This is why we like bitcoins. Accepting the fact that there is still some time and development required to create the triggers that will encourage wholesale adoption, there is enough there today to encourage everyone in payments to redefine their strategies.""  Looking at bitcoin  If bitcoin and its digital cousins are so admired by Realex as a driving force of change, does the company plan to add cryptocurrencies to its business payments options, or its personal wallet service Realex Fire soon?  ""Both Realex Payments as a gateway for online commerce and Realex Fire as a payment account are highly compatible with bitcoin – we are considering all angles here!""  The regulation issue  Many people involved with bitcoin see regulation by financial authorities as unnecessary and, indeed, detrimental to its decentralised and trust-less nature.  Regulation would, they fear, place burdens on bitcoin businesses, such as licence fees and compliance hurdles, which would raise the bar to entry and end up effectively centralising aspects of the industry in the hands of governments.  Michael Jackson  , Skype's former COO, agrees that bitcoin businesses should avoid being regulated as much as possible.  He recently told CoinDesk: “Companies need to just carry on doing what they are doing – if they can make a case for themselves that they don’t need regulation, they shouldn’t even go near it.""  [post-quote]  Such libertarian ideals are not universal, however. Many businesses in the bitcoin sphere now acknowledge the need for certain controls and standards, especially in the wake of Mt. Gox's demise and the resulting loss of public trust in the bitcoin system.  Lyon, too, sees the need for rules in certain areas of the industry. In fact, he believes they can be beneficial.  Part of Realex Payments' business is currently regulated, and the company supports the regulation of entities that engage in core payment services, whether these use fiat or not.  He said: “The conduct regulation is good for the users of payment services – both personal and business alike. Regulation is essential for the future development and adoption of bitcoin.""  How to grow the industry  In Ireland, Lyon said, there are no e-money licenced institutions and only a handful of payment institutions, so more are needed. Furthermore, he advocates the creation of a new regulatory body to oversee and develop this market:  ""We need more competition in the payment market and we believe that it is time to create a new industry wide payments regulator. A new body that can consider innovation, competition and the overall development and strategy of the payments market.""  Such a body could, he said, fall under the veto of the central bank, but having a separate board and executive team on a new payments regulator would be ""a significant step on the journey to ensure Ireland remains at the forefront of payments innovation"".  Lyon explained that the United Kingdom has taken great leaps forward in payments regulation by engaging with all players in the industry.  Now, with the cooperation of the Payments Council and the Financial Conduct Authority, the UK is in the early stages of forming a new payments systems regulator, he added.  ""That will lead to innovation and competition in the market.""  What the future holds  Looking ahead, Lyon sees a bright future for the payments industry, and considers the arrival of the new block chain-based digital currencies a boon, not a burden.  ""Payment processing is set to become more accessible, more integrated, safer and less expensive,"" he said, adding:  ""Bitcoin has a big role to play here, not just in itself as a new way to transfer value, but also as a catalyst that has sparked the debate about the need for real and deep innovation in payments.""  It isn't just bitcoin businesses that are excited about the future, it seems.

42397714,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDrOO,1403007287,In Search of the Ideal Bitcoin Jurisdiction,"Jurisdictions embracing bitcoin and bitcoin-related businesses can dramatically improve their countries' economies in a multitude of ways. But, what exactly would a favorable bitcoin jurisdiction look like?  For starters, it would ideally have no VAT or capital gains tax on bitcoin transactions and would encourage an active two-way exchange market with national currencies.  Commercial banking partners would not be subject to costly and overbearing regulatory guidelines that threaten or impede innovation. Furthermore, wallet providers, merchants, and payment processors would be under no restrictions.  Isle of Man  As the bitcoin protocol expands globally, we are already witnessing some jurisdictions announce their intentions to become welcoming business hubs for bitcoin innovation.  Most recently, UK Crown dependency, the Isle of Man, outlined plans to provide an environment that enables companies operating within the bitcoin space to flourish and its government posted an informative Questions & Answers document.  Capitalizing on the inability of more bureaucratic jurisdictions to embrace bitcoin, group General Counsel for Counting House Services Paul Davis emphasized:  “They cannot come here to launder money, defraud the public, or damage the island’s reputation. But they can pitch their tent here, do their business, build their software and offer their services.”  Furthermore, the island’s Financial Supervision Commission, confirmed in March that a bitcoin exchange holding client funds with a licensed overseas payment service provider is not required to obtain a licence in the country for its activities.  Luxembourg  Luxembourg also made headlines earlier in the year when it publicly advertised its intention to start an open dialogue with bitcoin businesses seeking a jurisdictional home.  Several teams of bitcoin industry experts have already met with Luxembourg officials. Michael Jackson, partner at Luxembourg-based Mangrove Capital Partners, characterized his conversations with the country’s regulators thus:  “[They're saying] we’re very open to people coming here and explaining their businesses. We don’t have any problem with a bitcoin business, as long as it does what it’s supposed to do and behaves properly.”  Jackson also expressed optimism that Luxembourg’s decision would carry weight in the broader European community, noting that it is a financial center of Europe.  Gibraltar  Somewhat reluctantly, Gibraltar has recognised its leadership role in the electronic payments industry for e-gaming and what that means for bitcoin. The British Overseas Territory has hosted two conferences, one in 2011 and one in 2014, that highlighted the strong business benefits for taking a leadership role on bitcoin integration.  KPMG’s Archie Watt told New Statesman:  ""Low cost, low hassle cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have the gaming world pricking up their ears.""  Two operators in Gibraltar have expressed to me privately that senior members of the Gibraltar government want the jurisdiction to lead rather than follow and that the responsive framework is already in place to make that happen.  A question of costs  When discussing bitcoin's benefits for an economy, one must distinguish between the economic benefits of a jurisdiction making itself appealing to bitcoin business versus the jurisdiction adopting bitcoin as its territorial unit, which is an entirely different strategy (to be covered in a future analysis).  The economic benefits of the former can be seen as setting the stage for bitcoin jurisdictional arbitrage.  'Jurisdictional arbitrage' is defined as the practice of taking advantage of the discrepancies between competing legal jurisdictions. According to Wikipedia, it takes its name from arbitrage, the financial practice of purchasing a good at a lower price in one market and selling it at a higher price in another.  Patri Friedman  , grandson of economist Milton Friedman, explains that, just as in financial arbitrage, the attractiveness of jurisdiction arbitrage depends largely on its transaction costs – in this case, the costs of switching legal service providers from one government to another.  Reaping the rewards  With respect to extreme economic benefits, a jurisdictional hub for bitcoin with an independent and functioning court system would immediately experience an influx of new capital and new businesses, thereby contributing to a growing GDP (Gross Domestic Product).  [post-quote]  Due to bitcoin's inherent lack of a third-party intermediary, the leading financial service industries of today would gradually become dis-intermediated and this newly open jurisdiction would serve as the disruptors' laboratory.  New, disruptive operators geared towards building out the bitcoin mobile payments infrastructure, funds transfer business and asset management industry would flock to the region, spurring vigorous job growth and opportunity.  The hub would soon find itself a magnet for related advisory services, venture capital, and other professional support services seeking to capitalize on the bitcoin boom. Retail banks could be rejuvenated as demand increases for true bitcoin services, such as foreign exchange, transaction escrow services, and trusted safekeeping.  Most significantly though, a forward-looking jurisdiction for bitcoin business would demonstrate strength and leadership for the new digital economy, catapulting the country and its people to the world stage.  Much like Gibraltar became the worldwide hub for e-gaming in 2004 and Zurich became the world's gold trading hub in 1968 due to the collapse of the London Gold Pool, a jurisdictional bitcoin haven would make history.

42397702,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDrMQ,1402999527,Winklevoss Price Ticker Makes Debut on Bloomberg,"The Winklevoss' bitcoin price index, the 'WinkDex', has made its first appearance on Bloomberg. Listed on the platform under WINKBTCO, the move is an important step for the young index, launched earlier this year.  In a brief blog post the team say they are honoured to be working with Bloomberg to bring a “blended bitcoin price index” to the wider investor community. In addition, the WinkDex is about to get a number of new features over the next few weeks, including an API.  WinkDex was launched in February and it is just one bitcoin related initiative headed by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. The twins are working towards the launch of their Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The idea was floated last year and the ETF is currently awaiting regulatory approval.  The WinkDex can be viewed as a component of the Winklevoss' ETF push. It was announced in one of the ETF regulatory filings and described as a method of establishing an accurate spot price that eliminates price confusion and reflects the true value of bitcoin.  The Winklevoss brothers claimed to hold 1% of all bitcoins when their initial ETF document was submitted last July.  Bloomberg and bitcoin  Bloomberg started experimenting with a bitcoin price ticker last year. The platform has since integrated bitcoin pricing (from exchanges Coinbase and Kraken) alongside news on its Bloomberg Professional service.  The service has more than 300,000 subscribers, mainly financial professionals, who pay upwards of $20,000 each year to use it.  These users now have the ability to track bitcoin prices along with relevant news and social media posts. However, Bloomberg has reiterated that the decision is not an endorsement of bitcoin, emphasising that investors cannot yet trade the cryptocurrency on its platform.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/17/winklevoss-price-ticker-makes-debut-on-bloomberg,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/956c765fcd32d5359d6c12423e2645a38e70b9c1-1148x792.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397698,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDrGW,1402969879,"New Singapore Industry Association to Promote Bitcoin Use, Best Practices","Bitcoin businesses in Singapore now have a new group to promote their cause, with the formation of the Association of Crypto-Currency Enterprises and Start-ups, Singapore (ACCESS) on 30th May.  ACCESS, which launched publicly just yesterday, represents various businesses within the Singapore bitcoin and other cryptocurrency ecosystem, including exchanges, merchant transaction services, vending machines and miners.  As a condition of membership, members must abide by a Code of Conduct.  Mission and objectives  The Association's Mission is ""To facilitate legitimate use of cryptocurrencies in Singapore"", and its vision is ""to promote Singapore businesses using cryptocurrencies and lower the cost of business transactions"".  It wants to promote Singapore globally and industry-wide as the world's premier location for cryptocurrency-related businesses and services. It recognizes the need for regulation, saying the framework must balance the necessity for innovation with the duty to protect both consumer end-users and commercial entities.  ACCESS will also promote adoption and development of digital currencies within Singapore itself, through education, public engagement and effective engagement with governmental and non-governmental bodies.  It also seeks to ""promote the development, dissemination and adoption of best-practices by Singaporean digital currency businesses and other industry participants, and to counter illegitimate use of the technology.""  Chairman Anson Zeall of CoinPip reiterated these main points at the Inaugural General Meeting on 13th June:  ""ACCESS aims to provide an open and clear dialogue between Singapore cryptocurrency businesses and the wider public, including regulators. With the forming of our association, we will help facilitate an ecosystem where Singapore can be a hub for cryptocurrencies businesses to grow and create jobs related to this new and growing technology.""  The seven-member executive team features other notable Singapore bitcoin business representatives, including President Antony Lewis of exchange itBit, and Secretary General Jarrod Luo of local ATM/vending machine producer Tembusu Terminals.  Registration  ACCESS is a fully registered society with the Registry of Societies under the Ministry of Home Affairs.  Singapore law states that any professional society concerning monetary activity must register with the government. Although bitcoin is still not legally defined as money, since its most common use is as such, ACCESS decided the best option would be to register.
