42429395,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxnnh,1531172346,$7K Back in Play? Price Indicators Shift In Bitcoin Rally's Favor,"It may not have been the asset's biggest rally, but it's hard to say bitcoin isn't building on gains.  Since hitting an annual low of $5,785 in June, bitcoin has increased roughly 15 percent against the U.S. dollar, and technical indicators suggest the cryptocurrency might not be calling it quits just yet.  That said, you'd be forgiven for having doubts. The rally has been interrupted over the past few days by resistance at $6,800, a level first approached on July 4. With a close of $6,584, the day arguably saw control slip back into the hands of bears eager to drive prices lower.  However, bears couldn't further capitalize as price followed the rejection by entering a narrow trading range of less than $250 over the following two days. (Narrowing ranges typically end in a breakout and this was no exception. As such, bulls were able to swing prices back to $6,840 on July 7.)  Still, several technical indications suggest positive sentiment is building and that prices could comfortably rise above $7,000 in the coming days.  4-hour chart  After rejecting from the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level (from May high of $10,000) the bitcoin price has formed the continuation pattern of a bull flag.  What's more, the CMF, an indicator used for displaying buy and sell pressure, shows buy pressure is mounting while price is traveling down the flag (a bullish divergence).  The 4-hour chart also displays a bullish cross of the 50- and 200-period exponential moving averages (EMA), further adding to the bullish bias.  The volume profile visible range shows low volume nodes (LVN) near $6,850-7,000, making the levels easier to be penetrated since it is an area lacking overall investor interest.  Inverse head and shoulders        An inverse head-and-shoulders pattern has also appeared on the 4-hour chart, the neckline of which is the same elusive resistance of $6,800 previously mentioned.  A convincing close above the neckline has the potential for the trend reversal pattern to take effect, potentially opening the doors to the next Fibonacci retracement (0.382) near $7,400.  Weekly  On a wider lens, the price of bitcoin recently found support on the 75-week exponential moving average (EMA) for the second time in two years, granting bulls more time to cross their next hurdle - the descending trend line of resistance.  A convincing break of the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern and the $6,800 level would likely send price to the test the fast approaching trendline and potentially break it.  Since technical analysis is largely self-fulfilling prophecy, breaking the widely recognized trendline would increase overall bullish sentiment, potentially setting scope for prices in the higher end of the $7,000 range.  View:  An upside break of the current bull flag could breach the $6,800 level, causing the inverse head and shoulder pattern to take effect and potentially put bitcoin on the path to $7,000 - $7,400 in the coming days. A break of the long-term trendline could yield even further growth.  Acceptance below July 4th low of $6,414 would negate the short term bullish view while falling below the 75-week EMA would likely confirm a longer-term bearish trend confirmation.

Bancor posted on Twitter that it took its platform offline following the security incident, stating that ""no user wallets were compromised.""  ""To complete the investigation, we have moved to maintenance and will be releasing a more detailed report shortly. We look forward to being back online as soon as possible."" A spokesperson for Bancor confirmed the incident when reached by email.  Nate Hindman, Bancor's head of communications, told CoinDesk that while the team had been able to block the transfer of an estimated 2.5 million BNT tokens – worth an additional $10 million – it wasn't able to do so for approximately 25,000 ETH – worth about $12.5 million – as well as almost 230 million NPXS tokens (worth roughly $1 million total).  All told, the company lost roughly $13.5 million in the hack, according to a follow-up statement.  ""We were able to freeze the stolen BNT, limiting the damage to the Bancor ecosystem from the theft. The ability to freeze tokens was built into the Bancor Protocol to be used in an extreme situation to recover from a security breach, allowing Bancor to effectively stop the thief from running away with the stolen tokens,"" he explained, adding:  ""It is not possible to freeze the ETH or any other stolen tokens. However, we are now working with dozens of cryptocurrency exchanges to trace the stolen funds and make it more difficult for the thief to liquidate them.""  The developments come more than a year after Bancor raised $153 million in an initial coin offering (ICO), representing the largest token sale of its kind at the time (a figure that was ultimately eclipsed by Telegram and, later, EOS). In addition to serving as a decentralized exchange, Bancor also allows for the creation of new cryptographic tokens.s moved out from Bancor addresses.  According to Hindman, Bancor has ""identified the cause of the breach and removed the vulnerability.""  ""We expect Bancor to go back online in the next 24 hours. We will continue to post updates as and when appropriate on our Telegram channel and on Twitter,"" he explained.  The incident appears to have impacted the price of Bancor's BNT token. According to CoinMarketCap, the token's price is down roughly 14 percent during the past day and is currently trading at around $2.73.

42429391,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxnXh,1531164005,$42 Million In Crypto Is Now Being Airdropped to NEO Investors,"Select Neo users are now receiving free crypto money.  Beginning this weekend, those who held tokens on the Neo blockchain, the 11th largest in the world, began to receive 10 million ONT tokens (worth $42,100,000 at press time) designed to power an entirely new crypto technology platform called Ontology. Recipients must have held Neo on March 1.  Part of the ""ONT token distribution,"" the move effectively rewards all users of the Neo blockchain for providing the technology necessary for the project's fundraising.  If that sounds confusing, the move has been in the works for some time.  In February, the Neo Council, a body set up to oversee the Neo blockchain protocol, announcedhttps://neo.org/blog/details/3061 that it would freely distribute 20 million ONT tokens – the main assets on the Ontology blockchain network – to eligible NEO token holders through a two-stage ""airdrop."" Ontology's creators granted 100 million ONT, or 10 percent of the maximum supply, to the Neo Council ""for relevant cooperation and to support NEO community feedback,"" the Ontology team wrote in March.  As well as the deadline for completing the Neo Council airdrop, Monday marks the beginning of Ontology's token migration, in which holders of Neo-based ONT must move their tokens over to Ontology's ""mainnet"" – its own, freestanding blockchain.  Ontology is one of several projects to embark on token migrations – also known as token swaps – in recent months. Some of the most prominent include EOS and Tron, both of which moved from ERC-20 tokens to native tokens on their own dedicated blockchains. (Ontology, as noted above, is moving from an NEP-5 token to its own blockchain.)  For users of certain exchanges, this process will be automatic, but others will need to manually complete the transfer. The Ontology team has posted an explainer, but the process will be more complicated for some users than others. Ledger wallet users will need to transfer their NEP-5 tokens to another wallet, for example.  Adding a layer of complexity, ONT tokens on Ontology's mainnet are indivisible. In other words, users cannot migrate 1.2 NEP-5 tokens to mainnet – they have to top up to 2 ONT, sell down to 1 ONT, or accept that 0.2 ONT will simply disappear.  Fortunately, ONT investors have until October 1 to complete the migration.  More details  Stepping back, Ontology, which launched at the end of June, and Neo are public blockchain protocols with teams primarily based out of China. Both emerged from Onchain, a Shanghai-based technology firm.  While separate entities, Neo and Ontology are closely aligned and engage in ""technical cooperation,"" according to Ontology founder Li Jun.  The Neo Council's ONT token distribution was divided into two equal halves. Anyone who held NEO at a certain point on March 1 is entitled to receive 0.2 ONT per NEO. The first half (0.1 ONT per NEO) was distributed to Neo addresses as an NEP-5 token – a Neo-based token standard similar to ethereum's ERC-20.  The second half of the airdrop began over the weekend, except that this time, ONT tokens were distributed as native tokens on the newly launched Ontology blockchain, rather than as NEP-5 tokens. As the Ontology team explained in an announcement, recipients' Ontology addresses, WIFs (wallet import formats), and private keys will be identical to their counterparts on Neo.  Social media posts indicate that at least some users have successfully received their ONT at the time of writing. The Ontology team's announcement gave Monday, July 9 as a deadline for completing the airdrop.  The Ontology community has another airdrop of ONT to look forward to, according to Jun, but details have yet to be revealed.  The Ontology team previously gave away 1000 ONT to people who signed up for its newsletter and completed a know-your-customer (KYC) check; it also gave 500 ONT to attendees of a Neo developers' conference who gave their email.

42429392,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxnhh,1531157725,YouTube Accused of Negligence in BitConnect Fraud Lawsuit,"Digital media giant YouTube has been named in class action lawsuit tied to the collapse of BitConnect, the cryptocurrency lending platform widely accused of fraud.  BitConnect's shutdown in January – which followed a series of warnings from U.S. investors – triggered a number of investor lawsuits, including one filed in late January in Florida. BitConnect's platform was tied to a token and in-house crypto exchange, both of which have gone defunct in the months since (once valued above $400, the token is now worth less than $0.50 apiece according to CoinMarketCap).  That lawsuit later became a consolidated class-action following a court ruling in June, coming in the wake of claims of an ongoing inquiry by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  The lawsuit faults YouTube for negligence in not policing the content on its site – particularly promotional videos by BitConnect boosters and affiliates – more tightly. The plaintiffs wrote that, all told, the top 10 most popular BitConnect affiliates ""published over 70,000 hours of unedited content, generating 58,000,000 views and luring hundreds if not hundreds of thousands of victims.""  They went on to state:  ""By enacting policies designed to prevent bad actors (such as those soliciting investments in fraudulent Ponzi schemes) from disseminating harmful, offensive or inappropriate content through its platform, YOUTUBE owed, by its own assumption, Plaintiffs and the Class a duty to reasonable care to prevent such content from harming its users.""  YouTube, according to the lawsuit, ""failed as a gatekeeper to protect its users.""  Google – YouTube's parent company – notably moved in March to ban cryptocurrency ads, including those tied to initial coin offerings (ICOs). That policy went into effect last month.  In an email to CoinDesk, David Silver, founder of the Silver Miller law firm that filed the class-action suit, urged the company to ""take responsibility"" for its alleged role.  ""The platform allowed BitConnect to reach hundreds of thousands of potential investors, all while YouTube was aware that BitConnect was a scam. As the old saying goes: Sometimes when you lie down with dogs, you get fleas,"" he wrote.  Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

To that end, Open Mineral – a startup established by a group of former employees from commodity trading and mining giant Glencore – said it has already started working with the ethereum startup ConsenSys to develop a platform dubbed Minerac. The firm did not disclose the names of the mining and financial firms that have so far agreed to join the consortium.  According to a report from Reuters, the project aims to have every party involved in mineral mining and trading logistics – from mining to shipping to storage and trading – participating as nodes of the new blockchain platform.  The goal of the project is to get rid of the existing complex and paper-heavy processes within the industry, and ultimately to allow the different parties to obtain updated logistics data simultaneously and transact trade documentation using smart contracts embedded in the blockchain.  As supply chain data is moved onto the distributed network, the report indicates, mining products can be traced with unique identification data that provides their point of their origin, allowing compliance with local laws.  Founded in 2017, the startup mainly serves to eliminate intermediaries for mining firms and smelters in a bid to reduce their costs when trading mineral concentrates.  The news of the new consortium comes just months after Open Mineral secured $2.5 million in a funding round in April, which was said to be specifically used for blockchain development, according to a news report from TechCrunch at the time.

42429358,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxjXh,1531141229,Block.One Is Taking a Bigger Role With EOS (And That's a Big Deal),"Block.One has decided to start voting with its hoard of EOS tokens.  Announced last week, the decision finds the startup that created the EOS software, now powered by the fifth most valuable cryptocurrency, breaking with precedent in a move that may have come as a surprise to those following the project's decentralized launch.  That's because since going live on June 14, the company has largely declined to exercise its influence over the code, preferring to encourage its users to unite, even in sometimes messy decision-making.  And there's a good reason for that. For one, Block.One controls 10 percent of the 1 billion tokens set aside for developers prior to the network's launch. Further, since decision-making on the platform corresponds to token holdings, the change could put the company in an extraordinarily powerful position, enabling them to decide who can determine truth on the ledger.  As of now, each wallet can vote to up to 30 candidates to serve as block producers, however, it's worth noting that block producers with the most support on the network have less than 3 percent of the current token supply backing them.  This means that Block.One controls so many tokens, that the field of potential block producers could effectively narrow to the 30 it picked, if and when it decides to finally enter a vote.  It's no surprise then, that the move has left some alarmed.  ""I find it problematic that Block.one is now involved in selecting block producers, as it undermines their role as a neutral third party, and affords them a significant amount of influence over the network,"" Arianna Simpson of Autonomous Partners told CoinDesk via email. (Simpson is not an investor in EOS.)  But others believe the decision is in line with necessity of innovation.  Christian Catalini of MIT's Cryptoeconomics Lab argued that each new approach to crypto governance deserves a chance to be tested so the wider crypto world can benefit from its lessons, saying, ""In general when you experiment you may land on solutions that may look appealing but don't stand the test of time.""  That said, the EOS community has largely expressed excitement about the company taking an active role in governance.  On a Reddit thread about the news, this reaction was fairly representative:  ""I have been waiting for this. I think this is a good thing, and will continue to align interests ... If Block.One makes money, I will make money as well most likely.""  But intermixed with the positive reactions, there were also observations like this one:  ""I think EOS will do great things, but this makes it Ripple 2.0. It's essentially a blockchain that is owned and run by Block.One. I'm not even saying that's a bad thing, but let's not kid ourselves either.""  How voting works  By design, EOS only has 21 block producers. The small size allows them to come to consensus very quickly, which is why EOS supporters believe it can surpass the leading blockchains by overtaking it in transactions per second.  The EOS community elects these 21 block producers in a continuous election, which allows bad actors to be removed at any time. Each wallet can vote its tokens for up to 30 block producer candidates. The 21 organizations with the most votes get to do that work, for which they are rewarded with some of tokens emitted through inflation by the protocol.  One of the reasons it took EOS so long to finally activate was because the software wouldn't go live until 15 percent of the total token supply had been staked for votes, but, as of this writing, roughly 30 percent of the tokens are staked for voting.  Block.One's founder tokens gradually release over a 10-year period. Until then, all they can do is stake them for use of the network, including voting. They can only cast one ballot and since all their tokens are staked until they unlock, they have to vote all of them or none.  As one redditor who looked at the wallet balances in the genesis block reported, 99 percent of EOS token holders control less than 14 percent of the token supply. The top 1,000 wallets control 85 percent of the supply. So, it remains very much a network controlled by its richest users.  Block.One is the largest single holder. Joshua Kauffman, who leads governance and community efforts for one of the top block producers, EOS Canada, told CoinDesk that he believes Block.One, ironically, wants to exercise its vote to undermine other whales.  There's a few block producers with very little support from small holders, he said, suggesting they are propped up by whale votes. Kauffman believes Block.One wants a chance to vote for the technically strongest candidates with the most community support in order to support the consensus of the most users.  ""It's in their best interest and the community's best interest to insure the best possible producers are the ones running the network,"" Kauffman said.  When it announced its intention to vote, Block.One also expressed support for a code change so that it can support 50 or more block producer candidates. That way, it's more widely spreading around its big votes, allowing the community to make the final decision about who gets into the top 21.  It would take a minimum of two months for such a code change to go live, according to Kauffman, so if Block.One waits for that change to vote, it could still be a while  Big decisions ahead  Besides changing out block producers, EOS faces other big decisions going forward, and by taking part in block producer elections, Block.One could make its say over those decisions even more decisive.  First, EOS hasn't yet passed a constitution to govern the protocol, so it doesn't have official rules for how block producers should resolve conflicts, as we have previously reported.  To fix it, Block.One has proposed a completely new constitution. The new constitution is much more narrow in scope than the one developed by the community. The company is asking longtime supports to jettison all that work in favor of a narrow proposal.  Block.One cofounder and EOS creator Dan Larimer wrote in a Medium post:  """"I have seen that if you give people arbitrary power to resolve arbitrary disputes then everything becomes a dispute and the decisions made are arbitrary.""  Second, the worker proposal system is coming closer to fruition. That system will allow the community to vote on paying tokens generated by inflation to teams that want to build new products to make the whole protocol serve users better.  With time, decisions about these proposals could also be important in determining the direction the network takes.  Even if Block.One abstains from votes in both of these cases, block producers with its support are likely to follow its lead, and the supporters of those block producers are likely to follow them.  By expanding the number of block producer candidates it can vote for, it might also expand the number that feel inclined to follow the company's lead.  ""I agree that Block.One has an oversized voice,"" Kauffman granted, but he also pointed out that the best way for Block.One to grow its wealth is by increasing token value. Disenfranchising rank-and-file users by controlling the process won't achieve that, he argued.  ""They want this to be the community chain,"" he said.  EOS is experimenting in a space that blockchains haven't adequately grappled with, Catalini said.  He and his collaborator Joshua Gans explained in a 2016 paper, this means that EOS has dramatically lowered the cost of verification, but it's now facing another cost also described in that work, the cost of networking.  Blockchains don't only need to come to consensus around the truth, they also need to find a way to coordinate economic activity around the world. That's their networking cost, and ""that's the one that really changes market power and market structure,"" Catalini said.  He added:  ""That's the one we don't really have a governance structure for; that's why you're seeing so many false starts.""

42429381,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxjfh,1531137646,World's Largest Bank Eyes Faster Asset Exchange With Blockchain,"The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), one of China's ""Big Four"" state-owned commercial banks and one of the world's largest by total assets, is seeking to patent a blockchain system for the exchange of financial assets.  According to a patent application filed by the bank in January and revealed on Friday, the system envisions a platform whereby participating institutions can function as nodes to form a distributed network.  When a user from one institution initiates a transaction request, it triggers a smart contract causing every node to validate the transaction based on the information provided, including the sender's account balance, name and transaction amount. A transaction would be considered complete once the network has received sufficient validations from participating nodes for consensus above a pre-determined threshold.  The goal of the concept, based on the document, is to eliminate intermediaries in the existing system and improve the liquidity of financial assets.  The ICBC said in the filing that the exploration arose since the existing system is slow and costly when sending interbank or cross-border transactions for both ordinary payments and financial instruments, such as precious metals and futures products.  The document states:  ""The traditional transaction chain that is built around a centralized credibility system incurs problems like the high cost, low efficiency, low stability, as well as inflexibility. This impedes the bank's launch-to-market process to meet the rapidly growing demand for innovative financial products.""  The patent application marks the bank's latest filing related to blockchain technology, according to the China State Intellectual Property Office. As previously reported by CoinDesk, the bank is also seeking to patent a blockchain system that can verify user information over a distributed network.  According to a news report from the South China Morning Post, ICBC took over Well Fargo to become the largest bank in the world by total assets as of January 2017. The institution held 24.9 trillion yuan ($3.6 trillion) in assets as of the end of 2017, as per its latest financial report.

42429374,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxk5h,1531134003,"Bitcoin Price Rally Stalls Below Key Resistance at $6,800","Bitcoin (BTC) rally has stalled near a key resistance range and a minor pullback could recharge the engine for a much-awaited move toward the $7,000 mark.  At press time, the premiere cryptocurrency is flatlined at $6,710 on Bitfinex, having clocked an 18-day high of $6,839 over the weekend and is showing signs of bullish exhaustion near the resistance range of $6,750 to $7,910.  For instance, BTC has failed thrice in the last seven days to hold on to gains above $6,754, which is the 23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from $9,990 to $5,755. Further, BTC has failed to close (as per UTC) above the stiff resistance at $6,800 in the last two days.  What's more, BTC will likely encounter resistance at $6,850 (multiple daily highs clocked in the third week of June).  And last but not the least, the 50-day moving average (MA) resistance is lined up at $6,907. Thus, the area between $6,750 to $6,910 is packed with key resistance levels and the signs of exhaustion near the resistance zone have left the doors open for a minor pullback in BTC prices.  That said, the pullback could help BTC build steam for a strong move to $7,000 as the technical studies are biased toward the bulls, as seen in the chart below.  Daily chart  The bullish falling channel breakout and the bullish crossover between 5-day and 10-day MA indicate the tide has turned in favor of the bulls for short-term.  The relative strength index (RSI) has moved above 50.00, confirming a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.  View  The short-term bullish outlook is still intact and BTC looks set to test $7,000.  A minor pullback to ascending (bullish 10-day MA) of $6,570, will likely help recharge the engine for a strong move towards $7,000 and above. So, watch out for a rebound from the ascending 10-day MA.  Only a daily close (as per UTC) below the 10-day MA of $6,570 would abort the short-term bullish view.

The sale, led by Andreessen Horowitz's new A16z crypto fund, saw Accel, Binance, Pantera, Polychain, Metastable, Foundation Capital, Electric Capital, DCVC and Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam all contribute, according to a press release. Most notably, this was A16z's first investment since completing its $300 million raise last month, Oasis CEO Dawn Song told CoinDesk.  The startup is now focusing on developing its core features, Song said, which will be deployed to the company's private test network – slated to be opened to the public ""soon.""  It's the startup's blockchain itself that may be garnering all the investor attention. According to Song, its architecture allows transactions to be verified with ""far less duplication while providing the same level of integrity and security guarantees.""  She added:  ""In our experiments we see performance orders of magnitude greater than ethereum. This architecture also supports far more computationally intensive tasks like machine learning and AI, which are not possible with today's blockchain technologies.""  ""Security and privacy [are] built into every layer of the network,"" she continued. As a result, the blockchain is built ""top-to-bottom"" with those two features in mind, ensuring that transactions can be verified without nodes seeing sensitive data and smart contracts will not leak private information.  The applications built upon the network will also differ from those currently being developed for existing platforms, Song explained. ""For example, our machine learning framework enables smart contract developers to perform training and inference directly in the smart contract, while preserving privacy of data.""  ""Our platform is also backwards compatible with Ethereum, making the transition easy for any developer that is already comfortable with existing tools,"" she said.

According to a local news report on Monday, police in China's Da Lian city have arrested 20 suspects from a computer technology firm who allegedly gained control of the large number of computers in order profit from illicit cryptocurrency mining.  The hackers created and embedded the malware inside internet browser plug-ins they developed for various purposes, such as enhanced browsing speed, which were shown in display ads that reached 5 million computers in the country.  By clicking the display ads and installing the plug-ins, over a million computers were subsequently infected, mining a total of 26 million digibyte, decred and siacoin tokens over the course of two years, according to the police.  The hackers apparently opted to mine more minor cryptocurrencies since they don't require such significant amounts of computing power, allowing the back-end mining process to be quieter and less likely to be spotted by victims.  The report also indicated the hackers developed a network of more than 100 agents to help propagate the illicit mining software, such as through working relationships with internet cafes.  The news follows a previous report in which another group of hackers was also busted in China for allegedly colluding with local computer maintenance firms to hack into over 100,000 computers owned by internet cafes – also to mine the siacoin cryptocurrency.

Long before he was known by his current nickname, he'd follow tourists in the heat of central Africa, swinging an ice box and offering them a chilly bottle of Coca Cola or Fanta with a sugary smile to match.  But as chipper as his demeanor made him out to be, Crypto Shaolin calls this past work ""frustrating."" Not only was it meager pay, he had ambitions to rival his role models Elon Musk and Steve Jobs.  One of these drinks may have put him on that path, though, when by chance he passed a Coke to a man wearing a strangely worded shirt.  Curiosity piqued, Crypto Shaolin asked what it was all about. After all, he'd never heard of ""HODL"" before.  ""[Crypto]'s the future,"" the man answered cryptically, adding:  ""Are you here tomorrow?""  The stranger would go on to give him what amounted to an annual salary in exchange for his interest.  ""I managed to escape poverty,"" Crypto Shaolin says of what came next.  The money, of course, wasn't in the usual form. The man presented Crypto Shaolin with ether, the cryptocurrency that powers ethereum, asking for only one thing in return: that he research the technology.  Without a laptop, this wasn't an easy task, but Crypto Shaolin would later find a cafe with internet that allowed him to continue his journey down the cryptocurrency rabbit hole.  ""I was so amazed by what I've just discovered I could not sleep the next days,"" he said.  New career  More than just a handout, however, Crypto Shaolin would use the opportunity for a career change, eventually delving into the world of digital ""bounty hunting,"" a job for which he is now paid in cryptocurrency.  Not a conventional employee, Crypto Shaolin is rather a freelancer of sorts for a platform called Bounty0x, a site that's part of a growing movement of similar services.  Ethereum bug bounty websites like Gitcoin and Bounties Network have seen increased use of late from both sides of the marketplace. (Afghanistan-based non-profit Code to Inspire recently partnered with Bounties Network to allow young women in the Middle Eastern country to pick up work for ether.)  As such, a growing number of people are making money off crypto – not in the normal way of HODLing or day trading – but by gobbling up small ""bounties"" by completing a whole range of tasks.  While these programs are mostly used to reward developers for spotting vulnerabilities in code, they've expanded to not only offer general coding requests but also marketing-like services, such as writing content and tweeting out links.  One unique part of Bounty0x, is it allows bounty hosts to post bounties in any cryptocurrency, whether ethereum or a lesser-known obscure token.  In this way, Bounty0x and other bounties platforms are showing that crypto, even in its nascent stage is having a positive impact on people in dire circumstances.  Speaking to that, Crypto Shaolin told CoinDesk:  ""My life has improved dramatically even with the bear market.""  Bounty0x specifically thrives on the non-developer-based bounties – and it shows since the platform has more than 30,000 active bounty hunters.  ""People in low-income countries are often excluded from global freelancing marketplaces due to a lack of formal education and banking requirements,"" said Bounty0x CMO Pascal Thellmann. ""Hunters ... can complete micro-tasks like retweeting a tweet or writing a review for a product, in exchange for a couple dollars in crypto.""  And while the rates might seem meager to those living in more economically prosperous countries, for people living in poverty-ridden areas, the money is a significant source of revenue, Thellmann continued.  Two tales of change  That's why Crypto Shaolin is far from the only one who's reported a ""life change"" thanks to the platform.  Nigerian writer Ayobami Abiola told CoinDesk he's making ""multiple times over"" what he used to make by using Bounty0x. According to Abiola, he's making this by completing ""bounties like article writing, posting on Reddit, Facebook like and share, Bitcoin Talk [forum] comments and joining Telegram groups for many projects.""  This year alone he's made more than $1,000 by collecting bounties.  And again, while that might sound like a pittance, it's actually double what most Nigerians make in a year.  Yet, it's not only those fighting poverty that are finding themselves better off with bounties platforms like Bounty0x.  Crypto enthusiast Vinay V, who lives and works in Bangalore, India, said he was able to make $500 instantly in his first crypto airdrop, a popular way of attracting users to new cryptocurrencies by sending them free tokens based on how many coins on another platform they hold.  This made him hungry for other easy ways to make extra money.  In that search he ran into crypto bounty hunting on Bitcoin Talk, and while he found it a good source of income, there was one problem with the user experience of that platform. Because he would sometimes forget to post to the forum to inform the party that had posted the bounty that he had finished, Vinay V said, ""sometimes ... I lost my stakes for the week.""  As such, Vinay V prefers Bounty0x, since once he finishes a task, the platform's smart contracts update all the reporting automatically.  ""Bounty0x as changed my life,"" he said, adding the bounties provide a ""secondary income"" for him and his family.  But it's not only about money. Abiola, for example, told CoinDesk he finds the work rewarding and intellectually stimulating.  ""Many times when I do these studies, I am like 'Wow this is impossible,'"" he said, adding:  ""I have been able to widen my imagination through these great innovations as I am thinking of making a difference in the world through the blockchain.""  The darker side  While it's exciting to see crypto making a positive impact, there's perhaps something a bit exploitative about some of the tasks.  For instance, scrolling through the hundreds of live bounties on the Bounty0x alpha platform, it's hard not to notice many of them ask people to promote blockchain products and initial coin offerings (ICOs).  As scams and fraud are ripe within the cryptocurrency space, some of these projects could be offered by those potentially using the promotion as a way to pump-and-dump their tokens. Not only that, but those accepting those kind of tasks could end up being held liable for promoting scams, should the projects be convicted of such.  It's an unfortunate reality in the cryptocurrency world at large.  Vinay V is particularly aware of this, as someone who ""got cheated"" by ICOs before. But the Bounty0x team argues they're careful about what projects they allow on the platform, and Vinay V says he trusts their judgment.  ""Bounty platform promoting them also should take care of fraudulent ICOs before listing them,"" he said, though while admitting there's always a chance that fraud will nonetheless fall through the cracks.  Not only that, but the bear market has also left its mark on Bounty0x and its users.  Many new users in the space were drawn in by the idea of striking it rich by being one of the first to adopt a revolutionary new financial technology, but BNTY, just like other cryptocurrencies, has seen a sharp drop in price over the last several months.  This has prompted some in the community to call BNTY a ""dead coin"" in the Telegram chat channel.  Yet, there are also comments to the opposite effect. Bounty0x is one of the only cryptocurrency projects that actually has a functioning product, supporters argues.  Along these lines, Thellmann sees Bounty0x as laying the groundwork for bigger disruption if and when cryptocurrency technology gains traction worldwide. He expects cryptocurrencies will replace fiat, ""cutting banks out of the equation"" and eliminating another barrier for hunters in poorer regions.  He added:  ""We believe that this is going to be the point that will make cryptocurrency bounty hunting platforms much more attractive than traditional ones.""

42429364,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxjnh,1531108855,Filings Link Crypto Exchange Bitstamp to Game Maker Nexon,"Public filings released in late May establish the strongest link yet between Bitstamp and Korean gaming firm Nexon, which was rumored to have bought the cryptocurrency exchange earlier this year.  Those rumors date back to the spring when sources indicated that Nexon would pay as much as $500 million for Bitstamp, one of the industry's longest-running bitcoin exchanges. Word of the acquisition also came months after Nexon bought a majority stake in crypto exchange Korbit for roughly $80 million in September 2017.  Business Insider  later reported in April that Nexon was in talks to acquire Bitstamp for $350 million. Lee Jungheon, CEO of Nexon Korea, said in the wake of that report that ""Nexon Korea does not have anything to do with a Bitstamp acquisition"" according to the Korea Herald.  But a corporate disclosure submitted by Nexon Group holding company NXC and obtained by CoinDesk suggests that some kind of deal took place. NXC, Nexon Group's parent company, is 98.28 percent owned by Nexon founder Kim Jung-ju and his family.  According to the report, NXC owns 100 percent of a Belgian company called NXMH B.V.B.A., an investment and consulting firm. NXHM B.V.B.A., with 99 percent ownership, created Bitstamp Holdings N.V., also a Belgian company, on February 1 of this year.  The report states that Bitstamp Holdings N.V. acquired 100 percent of Bitstamp Japan Co., Ltd on April 25.  But while the documents establish a link to Bitstamp, it's not clear whether they constitute an ""acquisition"" of Bitstamp given the lack of information regarding Bitstamp Japan Co., Ltd. The exchange is run by Bitstamp Limited, which is based in the United Kingdom and has offices in Luxembourg and New York.  A Nexon representative said that Bitstamp Holdings isn't the operator of the exchange, and later claimed that the NXC's filing was inaccurate in that Bitstamp Holdings created Bitstamp Japan Co., Ltd. instead of acquiring an existing company. When asked about the relationship there, the rep said that they ""cannot disclose any further information at this moment."" Bitstamp did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Game maker push  If confirmed, the deal would represent the latest industry buy for the gaming company, which has released a number of titles for desktop and mobile platforms.  The purchase of Bitstamp Japan Co., Ltd also followed a record-setting year for Nexon. The company reported more than $2 billion in revenue for 2017, an increase roughly 28 percent over the prior year's figures.  Nexon isn't the only gaming company with its eyes on the crypto space, however.  Gumi, a mobile game maker based in Japan, launched a $30 million investment fund earlier this year focused on the tech. And major industry companies like Ubisoft and Unity have also made similar moves in recent months.  Nexon executives have remarked on the technology as well in the past. Back in March, Owen Mahoney, CEO of the Nexon's U.S. arm, cited blockchain during an interview with CNBC as a tool for improving the gamer experience.  ""People want to trust other people within new games, and blockchain technology can help bring that reputation across different sort of games,"" he was quoted as saying.

42422916,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qzLh,1531101655,Walmart Looks to Blockchain for Better Package Tracking,"Walmart has yet another delivery-focused blockchain patent in the works.  The application published on July 5 is entitled ""Delivery Reservation Apparatus and Method,"" and as suggested, it outlines a way for managing package reservations in the context of the purchaser not being available to actually receive it.  It's the latest ""smart delivery"" intellectual property play from the retail giant, which in the past year has submitted a number of U.S. patent applications in this area. Indeed, the company seems to be looking at the technology as a way to automate elements of the delivery process, but to date, much of the company's public-facing work with blockchain has been focused on food supply chain tracking.  In the newly released filing, Walmart detail system of delivery lockers – located at a person's home, transportation hub or other location – that can safeguard the delivered items until their recipients can come and actually sign for them. Blockchain fits into the conceived picture as a method of connecting those lockers in order to track which ones are occupied and which ones are free to be used.  ""Each space on the docking station has a corresponding capacity unit for each location on the docking station. The transactions for the capacity units are tracked in a ledger, with available capacity units indicating an open location on the docking station or contracted out capacity units indicating that either the location has a locker secured thereto or that the location is reserved for a future delivery,"" Walmart wrote, going on to add:  ""In some embodiments, the docking stations utilize a blockchain reservation system. As such, each docking station can be a node within a blockchain network.""  The application makes frequent reference to a ""public ledger,"" suggesting that the proposed system would be openly accessible to some extent rather than closed off to certain participants. That leger, according to the filing, ""contains a record of available and reserved capacity units for the plurality of locker docking stations.""  This perhaps suggests that Walmart wouldn't necessarily be the only operator of these docking stations, and possibly is aimed at enabling a degree of participation by outside parties.
