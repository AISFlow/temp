14099772,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4613140-bitcoin-guess-whos-back?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1687478042,Bitcoin: Guess Who's Back,"Summary Bitcoin is back with a vengeance and above $30K. We've witnessed a rollercoaster of news; SEC lawsuits, BlackRock ETF and the launch of Wall Street crypto exchange. Bitcoin dominance is on the up, and GBTC is closing down its discount. Thesis Summary Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has moved over 12% in the last five days. The world's premier cryptocurrency has even broken back above $30,000. We could argue that a lot of this recent volatility has been due to the news surrounding the SEC, BlackRock ( BLK ) and now this new ""Wall Street Exchange"". On the other hand, we bounced exactly at a key support level and reversed in quite a predictable manner in terms of TA. BTC continues to dominate the crypto space, and it makes me wonder if this outperformance is here to stay. And while BTC is up 12%, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( BTC )"" target=""_blank"">OTC:GBTC ) is up over 30% in the last five days. What's up with that, and should you buy it? An Emotional Rollercoaster Bitcoin has been on a news and price rollercoaster while I have been on an emotional one. On June 6th, the SEC sued Coinbase ( COIN ) for operating unregistered securities. A day prior, the SEC served Binance ( BNB-USD ) with 13 charges . This triggered a sell-off in Bitcoin, and especially altcoins, which were specifically named in the SEC lawsuit. While the SEC's interpretation of what securities are surrounding crypto has always been less than transparent, its actions sent a very clear message. And then, swooping in with what now seems like impeccable timing, BlackRock sent in an application to launch its own crypto ETF. This happened last Thursday, June 16th. BlackRock has a good record when it comes to getting ETFs approved, 575-1. However, the SEC also has a great record at rejecting BTC ETFs, 33-0. A real battle of the Titans. In terms of the timeline for the ETF, K33 research has drawn a timeline of when this could be approved. Blackrock ETF timeline (K33) Looks like both ARK and BlackRock could possibly have an ETF out just ahead of the Bitcoin halving. Very good timing indeed. The BlackRock ETF application seems to have triggered a green light for institutional investors, and we now know that Wall Street ""Insiders"", like Charles Schwab ( SCHW ) and Citadel Securities, amongst others, are joining forces to launch an institutional crypto exchange called EDX markets. Just to sum up, let's have a look at how these events look against the BTC price chart. BTC timeline (Author's work) Bitcoin Outlook Looking at the chart above, one could say that sentiment has shifted. Indeed, it would appear that the BlackRock ETF changed the tides of Bitcoin, and the fact that this happened only 10 days after the SEC went after the two largest crypto exchanges in the world, is very interesting. In just over a week, sentiment went from complete desperation to hope and euphoria, and though this may seem strange, it is very much in line with the dynamics of Elliott Wave Theory. A wave 2 often reflects maximum fear and desperation, while wave 3s, to the upside, are the result of euphoria and high expectations. Let's review the Bitcoin chart I have been sharing with readers and subscribers over the past month: BTC TA (Author's work) As per my Elliott Wave count, the recent sell-off was a wave 2 inside a larger circle wave 3. So far, this has played out exactly as one would expect from a TA perspective. BTC found a bottom exactly at the 50% retracement of wave 1, which was the rally from $19.5K to $31K. This level also happens to be the neckline of our larger inverse head and shoulders we have been forming. I talked about this in my last Bitcoin article. And this is also the bottom of the downward channel we have been forming in Bitcoin (blue lines). Unsurprisingly, once we broke out of the channel, BTC broke loose, and only now that we approach the previous high are we seeing some red. So what can we expect now? The chart above lays out the path I'd expect to see as we approach the next halving, which is around March 2024. This time around, I believe we could complete most of the Bitcoin gains before the halving, even reaching new all-time highs. Bitcoin Dominance With the latest rally in Bitcoin and the shift in institutional sentiment, there are also a couple more issues to address. First up, Bitcoin Dominance: BTC dominance (TradingView) The chart above shows the percentage of the crypto market dominated by Bitcoin. As we can see, with the latest rally, we have broken out of a 2-year range and also broken out of an ascending channel shown in blue. From a TA perspective, this looks like it wants to head much higher, back into the 60% range. From a fundamental perspective, this could make sense. The new institutional interest seems to be so far limited to Bitcoin and some other major coins. BlackRock issued a Bitcoin ETF; not a crypto ETF, and the new Wall Street exchange EDX appears to be limited to Bitcoin ((BTC)), Ethereum ((ETH)), Litecoin, ((LTC)) and Bitcoin Cash ((BCH)). Altcoins did suffer the most during the recent sell-off. Is it possible that, moving forward, this underperformance will continue? While this is no longer the COVID era of free money where every coin was pumping, I still think there's room for more than 1, 2 or even 3 cryptos to succeed. Blockchain technology has many uses, and there are plenty of altcoins out there which puts this technology to use. My own crypto portfolio has BTC, ETH and over 10 other high conviction coins. Is GBTC a good buy? Lastly, let's talk about GBTC. While BTC has rallied nearly 15% since its low, GBTC is up by twice that amount. What's going on? In short, we are closing the gap. GBTC discount/premium (The Block) GBTC owns physical Bitcoin, but since it is not an ETF, and it can't arbitrage its own share price, it does not trade at fair value. The value of GBTC is below the value of the BTC it holds. In other words, it trades at a discount. What we have seen happen in the last week is a reduction of this discount, which has gone from near 45% to just under 35%. With the BlackRock ETF application, there are renewed hopes that GBTC could convert into an ETF. This would ensure that the discount is closed, meaning returns even above what BTC offers. But even if the BlackRock ETF doesn't go through GBTC is still deeply discounted, and we have seen this discount turn into a premium during the height of Bitcoin bull markets. Ultimately, I think GBTC is a good way to own some Bitcoin. Final Thoughts The recent Bitcoin rally has caught many off guard, but to those with keen understanding of sentiment and technical analysis maybe not so much. Moving forward, I expect BTC to reach all-time highs in the next year. How we get there, though, will depend on many factors. For now, I am looking at the $36K area as our next target.",POSITIVE,BCH,BCH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4613140-bitcoin-guess-whos-back?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png

This remarkable upswing has managed to captivate the attention of the esteemed trader, John Bollinger, who graciously shared his astute insights regarding Bitcoin’s current momentum. In his commentary, Bollinger observed, “The first pattern failed, but the second one didn’t.” This noteworthy assessment hints at the possibility of Bitcoin’s continued upward movement, emphasizing the potential for the cryptocurrency to sustain its positive trajectory. Dave the Wave contributed to the ongoing discussion surrounding the volatility of the stock. In a tweet, he provided a comprehensive analysis of Bitcoin’s monthly moving average convergence divergence (MACD), highlighting a bullish recross that hadn’t occurred in almost two years. Related Reading: Bitcoin Experts Predict “Great Accumulation Race”, What It Means Despite the complexity of these patterns, Dave the Wave’s research agrees with Bollinger’s forecast, pointing to the possibility of more cryptocurrency rise.

The convergence of optimistic analyses from respected market experts like Bollinger and Dave the Wave, alongside the increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs, paints a promising picture for the future of Bitcoin. The unfolding events in the forthcoming months will shed light on whether these indicators will lead to a sustained bullish trend for cryptocurrency. BTC’s Unusual Price Movement Yesterday, Bitcoin experienced a momentary surge, reaching as high as $138,000 on the BTC/Tether trading pair, according to data from Binance.US, a prominent cryptocurrency exchange. BTC falls to $29,800 | Source: Binance TradingView At 6:50 a.m. UTC, prices abruptly skyrocketed to those extraordinary levels but swiftly reverted to align with the prevailing rates observed on other BTC spot markets. Interestingly, the surge was limited to the BTC/Tether pair, while other BTC trading pairs remained unaffected and traded normally. It is highly improbable that the anomalous price spike was driven by a deliberate intention from a trader to purchase Bitcoin at an exorbitant premium of nearly 450%. Presently, Bitcoin is trading at just north of $29,000 during the European morning hours on Wednesday.

Stacks (STX) was among the tokens that stood out even when the market appeared gloomy and once again, the bulls achieved an incredible feat in the last 24 hours, pushing the price to a new 60-day high. Stacks (STX) demonstrated a significantly bullish momentum in seven days, going from $0.5501 to $0.8743, the highest price attained in the last 60 days. With this impressive price movement, a $1 milestone seems imminent. Stacks Defends Its Price Momentum According to CoinMarketCap data, STX has recorded a remarkable price increase of 72.66% in the last seven days, positioning it as the highest gainer on the weekly chart. The token maintains the bullish momentum at the time of writing, with a 24-hour price increase of 12.23%, leaving the current value at $0.8406. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Show Most Active Hour In 3 Months As BTC Breaks $30,000 With this bullish price movement, Stacks’ market cap has increased significantly by 13.45% to $1.172 billion. Stacks also witnessed a massive boost in trading volume in the last seven days. The trading volume went from $32.19 million on June 18 to $450 million on June 21, a nearly 1300% increase. The massive increase in trading volume demonstrates a surge in investor demand and buying pressure, reflecting the positive sentiment in Stacks markets. Though the volume seems to stall over the past 24 hours, the token still sustains its momentum, reaching over $351 million. What’s Influencing Stacks’ Price Moves Stacks is a Bitcoin blockchain layer that enables developers to deploy smart contracts, NFTs, DeFi, and dApps on the Bitcoin network. Simply put, Stacks brings DeFi to Bitcoin, unlocking billions in capital and setting the pace to activate a Bitcoin economy. STX, being Stacks’ native token, has been soaring recently due to the increased demand for Ordinals NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain. Dune analytics data shows that Ordinals’ daily inscription spending has increased from $29 million in May to $48 million in June. This increased network activity is significantly pushing the STX token price higher. Moreover, Bitcoin’s increasing market sentiment following news of BlackRock’s spot BTC ETF application must have robbed off on STX. Another factor behind STX’s price action is the increased investor sentiment due to the regulatory approval by the US SEC. Stacks recently became the first SEC-certified token offering in the United States. The legitimacy contributed to boosting STX’s price by attracting investors’ interest. Related Reading: ‘Ripple (XRP) Is A Must-Hold For The Next Bull Run,’ Says Bitcoin Maxi The broader crypto market performance has also contributed to boosting STX price.

STX’s primary support and resistance levels are $0.74054 and $0.8840, respectively. The token has already conquered the $0.8 resistance and turned it into a support level, indicating higher upticks as the bulls mount pressure to break the resistance level at $0.8840.

Debuting on April 26 in the Google Play and Apple Stores, the game was met with early enthusiasm, rising to the top spot in the App Store, which Mythical Games CEO John Linden captured on Twitter at the time:  Linden told CoinDesk that while hitting milestones like 1 million downloads is exciting, he’s more interested in how well the game has been received. “We're sitting at a 4.8 out of five on [the App Store] with nearly 22,000 reviews, which is great.”  “We're also seeing nearly two hours of gameplay per player per day, which is exciting. It's great seeing players really playing the game,” he added.  Other stats shared with CoinDesk by Mythical Games noted that NFL Rivals has seen nearly 15 million matches played and that on average, players have six gaming sessions per day, showing the stickiness of the experience.  The NFTs in the game are player cards used to build out teams and compete in the game. Each player card has different rarity levels from common to legendary and are assigned different strengths and weaknesses.  The fact that the player cards are NFTs is “behind the scenes” for most players, Linden noted, who are able to play the game without purchasing any NFTs. “Every player gets a wallet in the game, and then most of them probably don't know it's a wallet until they want to start interacting with the marketplace to buy, sell or trade.”  Linden estimates that roughly 10% of the players have interacted with the market to trade player card collectibles such as the cards released ahead of Super Bowl LVII.  “What we are seeing is that players when they come in, even if they're not familiar with Web3 concepts, they do understand the concept of hey, somebody wants to pay me $100 for my cards,” Linden said. “We love the idea that we can onboard them very gently into the space.”  See Also: It’s Game On For Web3: How Gaming Will Onboard a Billion People  The NFL tapped Mythical Games to launch its first Web3 game in May 2022, but it’s not the only foray into Web3 for the league, which also has a ticketing collectible platform on Polygon and a Dapper Labs-built collectible marketplace, NFL All Day.

42420125,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUZyRR,1687469368,"OPNX Files Defamation Lawsuit Against Mike Dudas, Issues Justice Tokens","OPNX, the bankruptcy claims exchange tied to the founders of defunct hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, has filed a defamation lawsuit against venture capitalist Mike Dudas, according to Three Arrows co-founder Kyle Davies and New York State court records.  In a summons notice filed in early June, OPNX alleged Dudas published defamatory comments about the company between February and March 2023, around the time that Davies and his partner Su Zhu unveiled their exchange venture. The document does not specify what Dudas’ defamatory comments were.  Dudas, a well-known persona in the cryptocurrency industry, runs 6th Man Ventures and formerly helmed The Block, a crypto media outlet.  “Along with my colleagues at Brown Rudnick, we are proud to represent Mike Dudas in defense of this lawsuit filed by 3 Arrows Capital’s ‘ecosystem partner’ OPNX,” crypto attorney Stephen Palley told CoinDesk. “In order to prove defamation you have to show, among other things, reputational damage. We look forward to seeing how the plaintiff plans to prove that in this case.”  The lawsuit comes as OPNX debuts a new “meme token” called Justice tokens (JT) that it says might benefit crypto communities who have been “harmed by defamation” by giving them a slice of settlements. Earlier this month it launched the first such token called $DUDAS.  In a white paper, OPNX describes JTs as worthless “meme tokens with no intrinsic value, no backing and no expectation of return.” OPNX can “at its sole discretion” decide to gift the proceeds of defamation settlements to some owners of JT tokens: OX token stakers (OX is the native token of OPNX), and also owners of the Miladies NFT.  Miladies NFT owners have suffered “long term defamation” and deserve some upside via JT because of their “persistent promotion of moral virtue in an era where the majority pander to social media algorithms,” according to the white paper.  Read more: Everything You Always Wanted to Know About ‘Miladys’ but Were Afraid to Ask  “Initial JTs will focus on OPNX-specific defamation, then expand to non-OPNX cases,” Davies told CoinDesk.  There are currently 43 wallets holding the DUDAS tokens, according to Etherscan data, although there is insufficient liquidity to trade them on Uniswap.  OPNX posited in the white paper that defamation cases in the crypto industry negatively impact entire communities of token holders; these communities should therefore benefit from “any settlements.” Justice tokens can be a “mechanism” to get that value to anyone impacted.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE,"Oliver Knight, Danny Nelson",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/06/22/opnx-files-defamation-lawsuit-against-mike-dudas-issues-justice-tokens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eb09a98af57daeb7ec8064b6978ffd842416b8c9-1582x890.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Department's Financial Institutions Division (FID), which oversees state-regulated trust companies, ordered Prime Trust to cease all activities which violate Nevada regulations, alleging that the company's ""overall financial condition ... has considerably deteriorated to a critically deficient level.""  Prime Trust is ""operating at a substantial deficit"" or may even be insolvent, the order said.  ""On or about June 21, 2023, Respondent was unable to honor customer withdrawals due to a shortfall of customer funds caused by a significant liability on the Respondent's balance sheet owed to customers,"" the order said. ""Additionally, Respondent failed to safeguard assets under its custody and is unable to meet all customer withdrawals.""  Prime Trust may not be able to operate in sound manner if it were to continue, the regulator claimed, going on to say it breached its fiduciary duties.  Prime Trust reported more than negative $12 million in stockholders' equity position at the end of March 2023, the order said.  Prime Trust can request a hearing within 30 days of the order. If it does not file for one, the cease-and-desist order will be deemed final.  The order was published on the Nevada regulator's website hours after fellow crypto company BitGo announced it was terminating its potential acquisition of Prime Trust.  A number of companies announced shortly after the deal's cancellation that Prime Trust had halted all fiat deposits in response to Nevada's order, though they did not share the actual details of the order.  Prime Trust interim CEO Jor Law did not immediately return a request for comment.  In a statement shared after the publication of this article, a Nevada FID spokesperson said the regulator issued the cease-and-desist on June 21, blocking Prime Trust ""from accepting fiat and cryptocurrency from existing and new clients for custody purposes.""

""Ultimately, Prime failed to safeguard assets under its custody and cannot meet all client withdrawals.

42420124,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUZyQP,1687467662,CFTC Charges Man With Fraud in ‘Pig Butchering’ Crypto Romance Scam,"The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has filed an enforcement action against a California man and his company for running an elaborate romance scam that swindled dozens of investors out of more than $1 million, according to a Thursday press release.  The action, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, alleges that Cunwen Zhu, a California businessman, tricked at least 29 customers out of more than $1.3 million allocated for digital asset commodity and forex trading through his company, Justby International Auctions, between April 2021 and March 2022. Instead of investing customers’ funds in crypto and forex exchanges, Zhu collected the money for his personal use, transferring the majority of the funds to bank accounts, digital wallets and digital asset trading platforms controlled by those he employed in his alleged scheme.  Zhu’s partners cultivated romantic relationships with his alleged victims, to “fatten them up with falsehoods, before soliciting the customer to participate in a fraudulent financial opportunity,” the CFTC said in a statement. The romance scam, known as “Pig Butchering,” has become increasingly prevalent since the pandemic, with loneliness among individuals living under stay-at-home orders on the rise.  “As people sought to escape the isolation of the pandemic and form a connection to others online, fraudsters saw a new venue to prey on and to take advantage of the public,” said CFTC Director of Enforcement Ian McGinley.

The green season could start, but which altcoin will prevail in the race? Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Show Most Active Hour In 3 Months As BTC Breaks $30,000 One analyst shared a theory about LINK’s potential to outperform the altcoins sector and stand as a top gainer in the coming months. As of this writing, Chainlink’s native token trades at $5.6 with a 6% profit in the last 24 hours alone. Chainlink (LINK) Price Target For A Bull Market LINK is one of the altcoins that gained popularity in 2020 and 2021 when decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols saw increasing adoption. Today, the cryptocurrency has taken a hit from the persistent bearish trend in the entire sector. However, analyst Daan Crypto believes Chainlink could recover and trend toward new yearly highs. Recently, LINK’s price crashed from a high of $9.50, forming an Average Range at those levels. In other words, $9.50 has been operating as heavy resistance for LINK’s price in 2023. During LINK’s downside trend, the analyst believes that bulls managed to defend $5.50, which hints at a positive forecast for the cryptocurrency. Via Twitter Daan Crypto stated while sharing the chart below: $LINK Followed the plan. It deviated below it’s 400 day range and retook it. Wouldn’t expect this to outperform many of the new shiny coins but the invalidation is clear as day and the risk/reward is solid. It’s do or die here. The chart above shows that if LINK bulls can continue the momentum, the token could rise as far as $10. This target corresponds with the channel’s top when the token has been moving for over a year. Related Reading: ‘Ripple (XRP) Is A Must-Hold For The Next Bull Run,’ Says Bitcoin Maxi However, traders should remember that the token has been unable to break above that resistance, always recording massive losses after hitting that top.

42420154,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUa0OD,1687466877,Stablecoin Movement May Hint Strongly at Asset Prices' Path Forward,"The buying power of stablecoins has increased recently.  The supply of stablecoins sent to crypto exchanges has risen as well.  Stablecoin movement in totality can hint at BTC and ETH price direction.  As Bitcoin and ether continue their recent price increases, stablecoins may offer powerful hints into the duration and extent of the surge.  Bitcoin and ether prices stalled on Thursday, with the two assets falling -0.63% and -0.70% respectively at one point (ETH and BTC were more recently up slightly). Volume on the day has been stable. Bitcoin and ether investors may be pausing to evaluate the changing landscape after the two assets’ 18% and 14% growth since June 15.  Of the macroeconomic data points released today, initial jobless claims had the greatest potential for market impact, although the total was only minimally above expectations and not enough to move prices. In the week ending June 17, 264,000 Americans filed for unemployment, slightly above forecasts of 260,000.  Stablecoins moving to exchanges increase  Recent Stablecoin movement, which usually provides insights into market movement, may have a more immediate impact and foreshadow cryptos’ price path.  The total stablecoins on exchange addresses has increased 5.6% since June 14, according to on-chain analytics firm Glassnode. The increase ends a 60% decline that began in December.  Stablecoins are often a mechanism to acquire crypto assets. An increase in stablecoins sent to exchanges represents an increase in buying power, as well as bullish sentiment.  An increase in exchange stablecoin balances is akin to an increase in the number of people standing in line to vote. In this case, the vote being cast is for which cryptocurrency the buyer is looking to exchange their stablecoin(s).  Stablecoin supply across blockchains contracts.  The aggregate supply net position change of stablecoins is still negative. The aggregate supply net position change measures the 30-day change of stablecoins across blockchains (ethereum included).  When the change in supply increases, the figure is positive, and vice versa. The analogy in this case is to the number of eligible voters. As investors acquire more stablecoins, this figure will increase, and represents an area worth monitoring for crypto investors.  The net position change of stablecoins has been persistently negative since April 2022, after 20 months of positive readings.  Ultimately, stablecoin buying power is increasing  Stablecoin exchange buying power has ended a six-month trend of negative figures and moved into positive territory. This metric measures the change in stablecoin flows on to exchanges versus the flow of bitcoin and ether.  The return to green signals that stablecoin buying power is climbing. Bitcoin and ether’s valuation relative to stablecoins may be currently discounted.  The confluence of the first and third metrics shows a creeping increase in demand, occurring amid favorable valuations for BTC and ETH. An upturn in the second would signal that more capital has arrived to capitalize on these valuations.

42420145,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUa0Ev,1687465824,"Bitcoin Bobbles, Then Returns to Perch Above $30.1K as Investors Weigh ETF Prospects, Macroeconomic Data","After surging for two days on spot bitcoin ETF euphoria, the price of bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, stalled.  BTC was recently trading at about $30,180, roughly where it stood 24 hours ago when investor optimism spiked after three financial services powerhouses, including BlackRock – the world's largest asset manager – applied for BTC spot ETFs. Bitcoin sank briefly to about $29,575 early Thursday after cryptocurrency custodian BitGo terminated its acquisition of rival Prime Trust – a rare sour note in an otherwise upbeat week – but quickly regained its perch.  In an email to CoinDesk, Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, highlighted crypto’s recent momentum amid growing concern about central bank prescriptions to tame inflation and their impact on economic expansion.  “Wall Street is becoming a little pessimistic regarding the global growth outlook as global central bank tightening enters a new phase, which all of sudden has made crypto look a little bit more attractive,” Moya wrote, although he suggested cautiously that cryptos’ current upswing could wane.  “Bitcoin needs to lead the charge higher over the next few days for momentum buying to kick in,” Moya wrote.  Read More: BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Would Be a Big Deal  Ether (ETH), the second largest crypto in market value, followed a similar path to BTC, dipping around the time of the BitGo announcement via Twitter but then regaining ground to recently change hands near the $1,900 threshold it reached on Wednesday for the first time since the beginning of June. ETH was recently up a few fractions of a percentage point. Most other major cryptos were largely in the green, albeit not as impressively as the previous day. ADA and DOT, the tokens of smart contract protocols Cardano and Polkadot, were up more than 2% and 1%, respectively.  The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets performance, recently rose 0.2%.  U.S. stock indexes were mixed with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 rising 0.8% and 0.2%, respectively, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) ticking down slightly. Investors seemed to shrug off the Bank of England’s 50 basis point (bps) rate hike, which veered from other central banks’ recent dovishness. Inflation in the U.K. remained at a stubbornly high 8.7% in May.  Crypto markets also seemed largely unimpressed by hawkish comments by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell who reiterated the bank’s intent to raise interest rates later this year. The Fed halted a more than year-long streak of rate hikes earlier this month. The latest weekly jobless claims report, meanwhile, had little affect on assets, coming in just a few thousand claims higher than expectations.

42420150,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUa0K5,1687464111,It’s Game On for Web3: How Gaming Will Onboard a Billion People,"In April 2023, a digital item with distinct, rare traits was sold to a gamer for $400,000 reportedly paid for in cryptocurrency. Digital assets similar to this one have garnered $100 million in overall sales the same month. But the $400K sale wasn’t for a non-fungible token (NFT) – it was a skin in Counter-Strike:Global Offensive, more commonly shortened to just “CS:GO”.  When I start conversations about Web3 with gamers, I often hear the same objections: that NFTs are “useless” “scammy” or “expensive;” that this is just another way for gaming studios to extract value from players; that gaming doesn’t need blockchain; and that crypto is “too difficult” to deal with. Many also argue that current Web3 games just aren’t that fun.  But the appetite for in-game items on secondary marketplaces is booming, indicating that gamers understand the value of in-game items, though they often deal with a considerable amount of friction to buy and sell these items. And digital currency is very much part of Web2 games like Fortnite and Roblox that scores of users pour millions of dollars into every year. Roblox has over 66 million daily active users (DAUs) as of May 2023 and made $7 million a day in 2022, much of it in the game’s native currency Robux, which can only be used within the Roblox ecosystem and has zero value outside of it.  While other industries like entertainment and loyalty programs have the potential to onboard millions of new users into Web3, gaming provides fertile ground for the seeds of mass adoption. Gamers are already familiar with virtual currency and understand how to buy and earn in-game assets. And while there are nearly 8 billion people in the world, over 3 billion of us play video games pointing to a considerable amount of the population primed for a gamified digital future.  This particular combination of opportunities was noted by Alex Connolly, co-founder and CTO at Immutable. “Gaming is the perfect candidate for spurring Web3 mass adoption simply because there are so many gamers in the world who are already used to trading digital items and buying digital things,” he said.  Yat Siu, co-founder and CEO of Web3 giant Animoca Labs, agrees that the gaming industry offers a robust framework for transitioning users from Web2 into Web3. “Gaming is basically a cultural and entertainment phenomenon that is bigger than movies and music. And gamers and people who play games already have a relationship with virtual assets and items.”  This piece is one of three in a series about the path to Web3 mass adoption. Read the case for entertainment here and membership, loyalty and ticketing here.  Healthy supply and demand  In order to create a winning economic formula, there needs to be both consumer demand as well as an opportunity for profit for the people feeding the supply.  “Gaming is the biggest industry when it comes to entertainment,” said Urvit Goel, vice president and head of global business development at Polygon Labs. “It's bigger than music and movies combined. And there is a very clear use case here. No one's spending as much on digital assets in any other industry than gaming.”  But according to experts, what's lacking in the gaming industry today is the ability for gamers to truly own their in-game items and profit alongside developers and studios.  “We already have a huge community – billions of people who spend hundreds of billions of dollars every year on buying items that they don't truly own,” Connolly explained.  Siu also noted that unlike other industries like music that have moved from the physical to digital realms through streaming, gaming is a “digital-first culture” that has had an impact on the physical world.  “Why do we have curved screens?” Siu provided an example of a gaming need that impacted real-world design. “It's because people wanted to experience their games in a curved environment. And so the virtual purpose drove physical needs, which is different from any other industries.”  “It’s one of the main arguments why we think gaming is just so powerful and so influential and has driven so much innovation,” he added. “It would seem logical to us that it would do the same for the metaverse and digital ownership.”  The offer of true ownership  Web3 gaming presents a unique opportunity for gamers to truly own their in-game assets, thanks to blockchain technology, which allows in-game items like “skins” (also known as “cosmetic” items that change the look of a character but offer no advantage in the actual game) to exist as non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  Currently, when players want to buy items like skins from huge Web2 games like CS:GO, Rust, League of Legends, Valorant or Fortnite, they can buy them directly from the game or via marketplaces like Steam.  But selling these items or even just giving them away is a bit trickier. One person I spoke with spoke about how he had created a dummy Fortnite account for his child before they turned 13 (the actual age you are allowed to play most games), but then when his child actually turned 13 and wanted his own account, there was no way to transfer any of the skins or V-Bucks (Fortnite’s digital currency) to his child’s new account. At that point, most of the items were not available to purchase or earn anymore, as they are tied to Fortnite’s ever-evolving seasons and ever-changing item shop.  There are some marketplaces on services such as Steam for players to buy and sell items from certain games, but there are price limits on Steam so no item can be listed for more than $1,800. The $400,000 CS:GO skin sale mentioned earlier wasn’t done in-game and the transaction wasn’t made directly between the two parties, but rather it relied on a third-party broker to set up the auction, take payments and transfer the assets.  Spencer Tucker, chief gaming officer at Yuga Labs, the parent company of the Bored Ape Yacht Club and Otherside Metaverse, told CoinDesk that gamers don’t “really yet understand what Web3 or blockchain technology really offers the players.”  But to him, the use case is clear. “It's about just getting something back for what you put into it, in terms of possessing some sort of interoperable utility.”  He gives an example of someone who bought a character in-game for $500. “You can't trade that character. You can't give that character to somebody else. You can't do anything with it. And so your $500 is effectively going to nothing.”  Instead of these in-game assets being trapped and losing all value, putting these assets on-chain as NFTs allows direct peer-to-peer transfers, and eliminates the need to trust third parties with your assets, money or access to your accounts. A user can gift their Fortnite skins and V-Bucks to a new account. A pricey CS:GO skin can be transferred directly from the owner to the buyer without the friction, cost and risk of using a third party.  Web3 allows individuals to decide whether to “trade it to somebody for something else, sell it or sit on it to see if it grows in value” – all options previously unavailable to them.  Polygon’s Goel echoed this issue with the current Web2 model, explaining that in-game items effectively go to waste once a player grows tired of a game. “There are games that I'm done playing and it's like, 'well, I spent my time, money and energy on this and there are other folks that actually might find value in these items and I can't give it to them, I can't sell it to them, I can't trade it.'”  Empowering creators and community  Another aspect that has allowed non-blockchain games like Minecraft, Roblox and Fortnite to grow in popularity and retain its users is that each game allows players to also be creators and contributors.  Siu explained that Minecraft’s passionate community has created a network effect that has led to its long-term success.  “People buy Minecraft today, not because they want to play just Minecraft. It's because they want to access the ecosystem of Minecraft, like the forges and all these external sorts of environments.” Siu said. “Microsoft continues to sell Minecraft copies of licenses because of the ecosystem that has emerged outside.""  “User-generated content (UGC) is the future of gaming, as far as I'm concerned,” Tucker said, tying the idea to Roblox’s breakthrough success.  “Imagine that UGC happening in your own ecosystem, and the opportunity for somebody who creates there can have financial upside,” Tucker said. “[In Web3], they can sell that experience or generate eyeballs or monetize it however they decide to do so. It engages the community, and now they have skin in the game, which reinforces that ownership and interoperability component and all these things operate together to create a durable experience.”  Easing development and onboarding  While user-generated content is a great way to decentralize the content mill and expand a user base, creating the right tools is essential for great games to build upon.  Although a lot of the focus is on the end user, both Connolly and Goel stressed the importance of investing in the development behind the scenes as well.  When asked what it would take to get a billion players to Web3 gaming, Connolly started by identifying “two massive challenges,” in the space right now. “The first one is the infrastructure that exists today to support Web3 games isn't mature enough. It doesn't smooth over enough of the user experience issues, it doesn't deal with scale well and it has problems with security.”  Immutable recently launched the Immutable Passport to “support the next generation of Web3 games by solving their user experience, onboarding, transaction and purchase, and game development challenges,” Connolly said. “This is how you get a high-quality game to the market as quickly as possible.”  Goel said that Polygon’s focus has been on supporting developers in building excellent consumer experiences.  “The promise around digital ownership is something that people want,"" Goel said. “They just don't care how we get there. And NFTs are a way to get there, but the masses don't want to hear about the technology, they just want the thing to run.”  “The biggest barrier of entry isn't cost,” Tucker added, “it's actually the friction around the technology, like wallet creation.”  Tucker believes that technology gradually moves mass adoption and noted how fast smartphones became ubiquitous. Similar to smartphones, he said, Web3 will also hit that inflection point where its use cases become more widespread.  “It kind of happens when something really breaks through and then it’s just good,” Tucker said.  The importance of the fun factor  While “fun” wasn’t universally agreed upon as the most important factor for mass adoption by the experts we talked to, the majority of leaders in the space come back to the point that games are supposed to be fun. According to a 2022 report on U.S. gamers, most people play video games because it brings joy (93%), provides mental stimulation (91%) and allows players to relieve stress (89%).  “A lot of the games we will actually see in the market are not very fun,” Connolly said, noting it as the second massive challenge in the space. “We think that all it will take to reverse this perception is a high-quality game that people simply want to play and that just happens to support Web3 asset ownership.”  Tucker agreed that fun was important, but added that a breakthrough hit would also need to give “players an experience that they don't ever want to remove themselves from because it's just so much better than what they had before.” Yuga seemed to have cracked some of the code for its Dookey Dash game, which while not the most graphically impressive or complex game, was fun enough to entice players to spend an average of 28 hours in the games’ sewer to top the leaderboard and win a one-of-a-kind, highly valuable NFT reward.  This layer of value is one of the things that Siu thinks makes Web3 gaming such an attractive proposition. While games obviously have to be enjoyable, Siu stressed that a player’s time should be given actual value.  “Your relationship to the game changes if you know that your time in the game is worth thousands of dollars to the game,” Siu said. “If you’re a guild leader in a game, it's probably worth much more than sort of a casual player, and that should be somehow enumerated.”  Siu also noted that esports, a $1.4 billion industry that draws in millions of viewers at live events and through streaming platforms could benefit enormously from the verification that on-chain gaming provides.  “One of the challenges with esports right now is that it relies on video screens for verification of events in the competition,” Siu said. “But if everything is on-chain, you have a way of verifying everything.” He noted that this would not only benefit the tournament but also the lucrative sports betting industry, which could leverage blockchain to authenticate results.  Experts said that the next big Web3 game could be a AAA game or could be a mobile game that offers a more accessible user experience.  “I'm not sold that it's going to be a high-end PC game or a high-end graphics game that's going to be dragged to mainstream adoption,” Goel said. “There are more mobile devices in people's hands than PCs and there are more people that have played Candy Crush than say, Madden from EA.”  Not far off  While experts have brought forward ideas for the future of blockchain gaming and its potential to bring in the next million users to Web3, it’s unclear when that watershed moment will arrive, though they agree it is not far off.  With heavy investment in the space over the past 18 months, Connolly predicts that innovative products will make waves within the next 12 to 18 months “simply because that's how long it takes to build a really great game.”  “There's some really awesome stuff coming,” he said.  Goel predicts that some of the “most advanced games” are currently in the final stages of development and are slated to release in the near future. “We think that by the end of this year, there should be a handful of really fun, directionally triple-A games.”  Siu noted that Animoca Brands has invested in “over 140 games” so far, many of which are set to come out by early next year. “It takes a few years to make a good game. So that means that the true effects of the mass onboarding I think will happen in the next 12 to 18 months.”  In the end, it’s not a question of if, but when Web3 games will enter space in a way that drives mass adoption.  “It's just a matter of time,” concluded Tucker.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | MATIC | TECHNOLOGY,Toby Leah Bochan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/06/22/its-game-on-for-web3-how-gaming-will-onboard-a-billion-people,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ec7e442a2d7116ed3aeaa71c44e57da78669155d-5040x3360.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42420149,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUa0I1,1687464106,Engaging the Masses: How Entertainment is Taking Web3 Mainstream,"Despite recent challenges to the crypto market, investment in Web3 remains high as institutions and consumers look toward an emerging digital culture built upon the values of decentralization and blockchain technology. While cryptocurrency and blockchain enthusiasts were formerly cast as fringe, vibrant communities have since sprung up on social media and across internet forums, bringing non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), play-to-earn gaming and the metaverse into the mainstream discourse.  Still, a recent report by Coinbase Institute shows a growing gap between the number of people who are aware of Web3 and the number of people who have actively adopted it. A survey of over 32,000 people across 16 countries revealed that while a majority of respondents were at least somewhat familiar with crypto or blockchain technology, many did not engage with Web3 services because of a lack of technical knowledge or not knowing where to begin.  “It's one thing to go jump into Web3 having done your research,” Chris Jacquemin, head of digital strategy at global talent agency WME, told CoinDesk. “It's another thing to really gradually move into this space, so it feels like you're foundationally getting it correct. Mainstream adoption will probably look less like a conscious choice and will just happen to be powered by this technology.”  Here lies one of the fundamental problems Web3 faces today: supporters of blockchain technology, often referred to as “crypto-natives,” often joke about existing in an echo chamber, yet the barriers to entry remain high, effectively shutting out curious minds. For the average person, adopting new technologies can be a daunting and often clunky pursuit. Web3 education remains a major pain point for developers and consumers, and while the number of unique addresses deploying smart contracts has generally grown, the number of active wallets has shrunk across crypto sectors, pointing to lower engagement even among those already in the exclusive crypto club.  Coinbase Institute wrote in its survey that Web3 adoption is predicted to increase by 50% over the next three years. But the question remains, how will that happen?  While the gaming and ticketing industries have found creative ways to integrate blockchain technology and offer new use cases, it is the entertainment industry that makes the strongest case on how to naturally implement Web3 strategies and onboard the masses.  This piece is one of three in a series about the path to Web3 mass adoption. Read the case for gaming here and membership, loyalty and ticketing here.  Connecting with people through storytelling  In its most basic form, good entertainment connects with its audience on a human level. And while the digital world seems to be becoming increasingly isolating and driven by artificial technology, visual media can serve as a reminder of our humanity and community.  Independent Web3 creative network Atrium, in partnership with Web3 community NounsDAO, is releasing an animated film based on the popular NFT characters. The Nouns movie origin story is one that is wholly Web3. Nouns are open source, meaning that the entire collection is in the public domain and can be used to create anything by anyone. And the NounsDAO voted in favor of a proposal to fund the project, providing its producers with a budget of $2.75 million from its treasury.  Joshua Fisher, one of the founders of NounsDAO community offshoot SharkDAO, told CoinDesk that the NFT project – which releases a new Noun NFT every day in perpetuity – has been able to grow in popularity due to its art style and messaging. A testament to its success, the project currently has a floor price of 35 ETH (about $63,500) and has done over 17,684 ETH (about $32 million) in trading volume, according to OpenSea.  “The style and the storytelling, it just works,” said Fisher. “You don't always know why or how but when you see something happening for years on end, and people like it, the chances are you pour a little gasoline on that fire, it's gonna burn.”  Supriyo Roy, founder and CEO of Atrium and the creative director of “Nouns: A Movie,” told CoinDesk that Web3 is changing the way media interacts with its audience, creating new opportunities for engagement.  “If you are starting with a story and you would want the community participating actively, even something as simple as giving a producer credit makes people feel like they’re a part of that story,” he said, adding that titles can be linked to rewards for fan participation. For example, he said fans can be given the chance to mint commemorative NFTs or enter into a raffle where they can win a cameo on a show or contribute to the writer’s room.  NounsDAO is tackling entertainment from all angles, building out an entire ecosystem through its recognizable characters. The group also voted to build out a comic book series with book publisher Titan Comics and NFT community ComicsDAO and previously approved a proposal for a short film “Welcome to Nountown.”  Adam Fortier, comic industry veteran and founder of ComicsDAO, said that integrating blockchain into his Nouns Comic series allows for greater provenance and tracking – which benefits both holders and creators.  “In comic books, your customer base is as everything,” he explained. “But you have silent customers that will buy everything that you do and hold on to them. You never hear about them because they never sell their product … But with Web3, you could actually track people who keep the product and you could actually reward them.”  Other visual media projects have integrated Web3 technologies into their audience engagement strategies, creating rich, interactive experiences for their viewers. Actress Mila Kunis used NFTs to raise funds for an animated series called “Stoner Cats,” while “Rick and Morty” co-creator Dan Harmon has long been developing a major network TV series called “Krapopolis” that allows NFT holders to vote on show elements. Web3 studio Toonstar has launched an NFT-backed animated series called “Space Junk” starring ""Napoleon Dynamite"" actor Jon Heder that invites holders of the related NFTs to create stories for their characters and participate in the narrative.  “The idea is that we are trying to tell stories that people can fall in love with,” said Roy.  Jacquemin, whose agency has signed more than 50 Web3 creators including Krista Kim and AI artist Claire Silver, sees common threads between all of the talent WME represents across film, music, television, comedy, books, art and theater.  “I think the common language here is creativity and storytelling,” he said. “So that's definitely a link that I think exists with pretty much any of the clients that we've elected to represent.”  Global talent firm United Talent Agency (UTA) launched its Web3 division in 2021 in response to a growing interest in NFTs and how they could be used to enhance fan engagement, art and brand loyalty. The agency, which represents talent across film, television, music, sports and more, recently signed designer and NFT artist Bobby Hundreds, NFT project Deadfellaz and crypto influencer Andrew Wang.  Lesley Silverman, UTA’s head of Web3, told CoinDesk that she is particularly interested in blending blockchain technologies to create unique strategies for each of her clients.  “We get to work with some of the best minds to create new use cases for Web3 tools,” she said. “We’re seeing early success stories around decentralized fan engagement and brand loyalty, with huge pop stars to luxury brands and more. In an age where AI presents a question of digital abundance, I am excited about how Web3 tools will be able to assist with rarity and authentication.”  Using talent to evangelize Web3  Not only are blockchain tools helping to deliver more interesting and engaging stories, but they are also enticing new talent to break away from more traditional spaces to join Web3.  In building a creative collective, Roy said that talent from traditional media giants like Pixar, Marvel and Netflix are drawn to Web3 because it encourages more creative freedom and offers newfound access to community and tools that are otherwise not readily available.  “You are seeing something like Nouns coming in and completely upending the idea of how funding is acquired and how funding is applied to creative aspects,” he said.  Fisher added that Web3 is creating its own media environment, with competitive compensation and less structure that rivals major studios without corporate oversight. “It has to be that either the pay is equal, or the work is easier, or it's less stressful than creating content for big corporations. There, you’re inevitably going to need the approval of somebody who probably has never made anything themselves. And that's not always easy.”  According to Roy, Atrium has been able to cultivate a roster of major talents motivated by the promises of a creator-driven economy that affords artists greater ownership and monetization opportunities from their work.  “They don’t want to be a footnote in a large production,” he said. “The feeling of fulfillment and that feeling of autonomy is unparalleled.”  Web3 also allows talent to claim their ideas in an immutable and public way, providing new ways to support artists from the start.  “With any decentralized blockchain, you do have that ability to really mark your idea in the sand eternally for the rest of time,” Fisher said. “I do think when something becomes popular as a whole, the community … will give those flowers to the creator.”  Jacquemin explained that crypto-native talent understands the emerging Web3 culture being built on social media platforms like Twitter and are able to connect deeply with their followers in new ways.  “There is this persona that they kind of live behind,” he said, referencing the use of NFTs as profile pictures (PFPs) to signal identity and community affiliation. “There's some uniqueness to that, but in a way, it’s not dissimilar to the idea of creating a film or a television show based on a graphic novel in that you're essentially creating a character universe.”  “People might follow one of these personas because they really like what they stand for, what they represent, what they create, visually or audibly, or who they are in terms of thought leadership,” he added.  Celebrities have flocked to blue-chip NFT projects, like CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club, to develop their online identities. For example, rappers Eminem and Snoop Dogg have used as their BAYC avatars in a popular music video that debuted at the MTV’s VMAs.  Going ‘stealth mode’  For many creators, Web3 tools can be used to enhance entertainment in a way that feels organic and not forced.  “I definitely think that there is an opportunity to build out fandom in a more interesting way with new Web3 tooling so the layer itself will be invisible and will be more custom made, where some of the unique user experiences can be powered right in,” Roy said. “Say you are watching something, maybe you can be rewarded for sharing it with your friends or for answering a type of trivia that you could only answer if you watched it. These are things that can be built on top of the ownership and composable stack, which is something that crypto enables you to do.”  Silverman said that as with any new technology, people may fixate on jargon instead of focusing on the user experience or end results. “I think the more the tools that facilitate necessary and unimpeachable new ways of interacting, the less people will focus on the terminology.”  This “stealthy” use of Web3 tools can help potentially skeptical talent wade gently into Web3, Jacquemin explained.  “One of the things that we recognized early on was that it felt like we were trying to teach people a new language,” he said of the initial friction with Web2 clients exploring Web3 tools. “Instead, we started to look at aspects of our clients’ businesses that exist today that you could put a spin on with a Web3 element that wouldn’t create friction in the user experience.”  Additionally, Web3-native talent can find ways to connect with more traditional Web2 brands or mainstream consumers by making their Web3 offerings more accessible.  “There's a better quality or a deeper quality of individual data that is transparently collectible,” Jaquemin said.  The path forward  While more people are familiar with the word “Web3,” the concept has struggled to keep audiences engaged. Attention – already a scarce resource in our modern age of information overload – is shifting to other shinier technologies like artificial intelligence.  But visual media entertainment remains a multi-billion-dollar business and the global visual content market is expected to grow by $1.4 billion by 2026. Americans spend over 13 hours on average a day using digital media, and new platforms and gadgets are continuously being developed to create a more immersive user experience. The average U.S. household owns an average of 11 connected devices, including seven with screens.  Hate it or love it, our need for entertainment is omnipresent and our craving for visual stimuli remains a major economic driver. Major players, like Warner Bros., Netflix, Sony, Paramount, Village Roadshow have already started experimenting with Web3 tools in order to stay competitive.  “I think so much has yet to be explored successfully around film and television as it relates to Web3,” said Silverman.  From creating rich NFT ecosystems to integrating crypto payments into existing models, entertainment giants, talent agencies and creative networks continue to find new ways to organically weave in Web3. Ultimately, consumers will be motivated to embrace an emerging digital future not through fanciful tech, but rather through engaging experiences designed to delight.  “You don't have to say ‘Hey, this is a Web3 project.’ You don't have to say that something is based upon an NFT or that this is a crypto thing,” said Fortier. “You could just say ‘Here's this animation. You like it?’”",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Rosie Perper,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/06/22/engaging-the-masses-how-entertainment-is-taking-web3-mainstream,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7b775a99886c950738098a47b8008059a2bc1fbd-4569x3047.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42420148,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUa0J3,1687464098,"Loyalty, Memberships and Ticketing: How NFTs Will Bring About Mass Adoption","As the crypto market faces new challenges and market downturn, many are looking elsewhere for glimmers of what the future of decentralization and blockchain technology will be.  Non-fungible tokens (NFTs), particularly in the form of profile pictures (PFP) collections, experienced a boom in sales in 2021. Many adopted these colorful JPEGs as a reflection of their digital identities and built communities as Web3, or the next iteration of the internet, began to take shape.  But as trading NFTs has slowed, the conversation has shifted away from the short-term value of NFTs and chasing hype cycles to the long-term utility of holding on to these tokens for the long haul.  Many brands have already started exploring the creative use cases of NFTs and how these digital tokens can be utilized for more than just quick investment opportunities. Companies are now looking at NFTs as a way to build stronger relationships between brands, creators and consumers by tying rewards to long-term ownership.  For example, GQ released an NFT-linked magazine subscription in February, while sports outlet Sports Illustrated released an NFT ticketing program in May. Meanwhile, Starbucks launched its’ Odyssey Web3 loyalty program in beta in October, rewarding its most loyal coffee drinkers for digital engagement.  Top of mind for these popular mainstream brands is bringing in new customers looking for richer brand experiences, without compromising on integrity or creating complicated onboarding procedures. For some thought leaders, loyalty programs, memberships and ticketing opportunities are the clearest use cases for NFTs and present a path forward for onboarding the most new users into Web3.  This piece is one of three in a series about the path to Web3 mass adoption. Read the case for entertainment here and gaming here.  The loyalty economy, enhanced through NFTs  Loyalty programs, or points-based systems such as Delta Airlines’ Skymiles or makeup retailer Sephora’s Beauty Insider program, reward customers for purchasing a brand’s goods and services. According to a July 2022 survey by LendingTree, at least eight in 10 Americans are members of at least one loyalty program. Matt Schulz, LendingTree's chief credit analyst, said in the report that consumers often look to loyalty programs for better discounts, shorter routes to earning free goods and exclusive deals.  NFTs have found a place within these systems for their ability to create a community around a brand, as seen in blue-chip collections such as Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), Moonbirds, or Goblintown. They’re also helping reshape the incentive-driven, transactional nature of Web2 loyalty programs by bringing digital identity and ownership to the table – new components of loyalty programs enabled by blockchain technology.  Tara Fung, CEO and co-founder of Web3 infrastructure company Co:Create, told CoinDesk that NFT loyalty gives users opportunities to more closely connect with the brands they love. On the flip side, brands can more effectively connect and engage with their audiences.  “Because loyalty is a known concept that specifically means retention marketing, it can be so much more than that by integrating Web3 as part of the tech stack,” said Fung. “The value that Web3 brings as part of the tech stack is that it introduces a greater degree of ownership of someone's loyalty.”  In building out new blockchain loyalty programs, Fung noted that there needs to be a careful balance between providing services to people already engrossed in Web3, often referred to as Web3-natives, without turning off potential new users.  “It's still a balance. It's still a trade-off,” said Fung. “But we're trying to serve those two needs of helping anyone engage with, and experience Web3 at first, and ensuring that the Web3-native user feels like these are actually my assets and I can take them with me wherever I go.”  For companies seeking to add Web3 loyalty benefits to existing goods and services, onboarding is often a pain point. It’s at the forefront for Blackbird, a restaurant loyalty program builder that offers benefits to frequent diners of restaurants.  Ben Leventhal, founder and CEO of Blackbird and former co-founder and CEO of reservation platform Resy, told CoinDesk that he sees NFTs as the most effective mechanism for engaging and rewarding restaurant-goers for their brand loyalty.  Blackbird’s NFT loyalty program is simple: when a diner eats at a restaurant supported by Blackbird, they immediately receive an NFT minted into a unique backend wallet marking their “proof of dining.” Each time they return to that restaurant, the NFT morphs into a new token with added rarity traits.  “Generally speaking, we think about loyalty and connectivity, but also making a restaurant feel magical and exciting, for building long-term engagement and the relationship between restaurants and guests,” said Leventhal.  Blackbird, along with many other projects utilizing blockchain technology, has taken the approach of removing the jargon associated with Web3 in order to be as welcoming to new users as possible. For example, some companies, including Nike and Starbucks, have chosen to forgo the use of the word NFT in their marketing materials and have called their offerings “digital collectibles” and “tokenized assets” instead.  In building Blackbird, Leventhal aims to “abstract” the blockchain technology and terminology away from the user experience in order to put engagement at the forefront of its branding.  Ninety-nine percent of “restaurant goers are not engaging with Blackbird because they want to engage with a Web3 company, they're engaging with Blackboard because they want to engage with a restaurant,” Leventhal said.  Non-fungible tickets  The fiasco surrounding pop star Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour ticket sales accomplished exposed large flaws across the entire mainstream ticketing industry. From faulty platforms, to duplicate tickets, to exorbitant resale prices, Swifties and other fans often face major barriers to obtaining tickets.  NFT ticketing provides a solution to some of the issues currently plaguing the events industry.  David Marcus, EVP of music at Ticketmaster, explained that artists can use token-gated ticketing as a way to better control how their tickets get to fans. For example, metal band Avenged Sevenfold, through Ticketmaster, offered exclusive tickets to their live show for holders of its Deathbats Club NFT collection.  “Any artist who is minting their own NFTs can explore token-gated sales, which can be used to help match token holders with premier seats, pre-show experiences or to simply give first access to all tickets on an upcoming tour,” he told CoinDesk, adding that there is also a growing trend of NFTs being used as “mementos to commemorate and relive live experiences.”  In order for NFT ticketing to evolve and grow, Marcus said that the capability “requires activated communities in Web3, which are still growing in wider scale adoption.”  Lead vocalist of Avenged Sevenfold Matt Sanders, also known as M. Shadows, told CoinDesk that while NFTs are not necessary for every type of event, they do provide fans with greater options that ease some of the pain points of buying and selling tickets.  ""What we really need is to give fans an option: they should be able to easily transfer or sell their tickets"" he told CoinDesk. ""They shouldn’t need to have a physical ticket, which is easy to lose. And they shouldn’t pay exorbitant fees – which often include shipping and processing fees.""  Alfonso Olvera, CEO of NFT-gated experience company Tokenproof, explained that NFT tickets can provide benefits to holders, such as on-chain verification of ownership, rewards for attendance, artist royalties for secondary resale and even benefits from sponsors of events.  While Web3 ticketing is still in its early development stages, Olvera is confident about the future of the industry, though he sees it as necessary to start with smaller-scale events in order to garner attention before the tech goes mainstream.  “They don't have this huge technology,"" said Olvera. ""And so those are the areas where we're looking to first demonstrate the benefit of proper NFT ticketing and then take it into the broader market.”  While the strategy to start small might make sense, notable players are already stepping into the Web3 ticketing space. In May, athletics magazine Sports Illustrated launched SI Box Office, a self-service event management and blockchain ticketing platform that helps events create and sell NFT tickets. Partnering with blockchain-software company ConsenSys, the tickets are all minted on the Ethereum sidechain Polygon.  “The one thing that we know is how important the live event is for fans,” David Lane, CEO of SI tickets, told CoinDesk. “Instead of building a legacy barcode infrastructure, we looked at NFT ticketing – not only do we believe it is the future of live events, but because we're not supporting legacy infrastructure, we had the opportunity to build 100% on-chain.”  For Lane, NFT ticketing can serve as the gateway for fans to explore blockchain technology and become more comfortable with Web3 events.  “This is the opportunity for that consumer – when they come across it tomorrow – to see something that's on-chain and experience a token-gated opportunity, crypto, or anything that the Web3 community is really trying to say,” said Lane. “It’s that first entry point, that first NFT experience to check that box.”  In addition, SI Box Office aims to make traditional entertainment or media brands more comfortable with entering Web3, bringing their audience along for the ride.  “We're waiting for a global, iconic brand, to come into the Web3 community and create something that everybody can really use,” said Lane. “We look at this as we help partners, strategic vendors, community events, artists and teams. If we can find partnerships, we can help create the onboarding into the Web3 community and show all of the amazing things that an on-chain experience can actually do for it.”  Web3 Memberships and Community Engagement  Beyond loyalty programs, some brands are using NFTs as a membership for entry into an entire ecosystem. These ecosystems not only provide users with unique experiences or perks, but also create pathways for communities to flourish.  Meral Arik, co-founder of Web3 membership platform Passage Protocol, told CoinDesk that Web3 memberships vary in structure and execution across brands and platforms – whether it grants holders access to a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) or a real-world social club. Smart contracts help power these memberships, acting as a “digital deed” to signify one’s affiliation to an ecosystem.  “When a consumer owns a membership NFT, they can feel like they own a piece of the brand, community or ecosystem that the NFT represents,” said Arik. “As a result, consumers feel more emotionally and/or financially incentivized to drive value to that ecosystem – whether that means purchasing more products, interacting on socials, or evangelizing to friends.”  Arik said tokenized memberships can also reward members for long-term participation in the ecosystem. She noted that Passage Protocol builds dynamic NFTs, which are tokens that develop over time as holders engage with a brand.  More importantly, she said that membership NFTs can be used to enhance already existing loyalty infrastructure without scaring away mainstream users with technical language.  “If executed correctly, a membership NFT can be a powerful tool or component to a modern membership program and it does not need to be the marketed focus of that program,” she said.  Web3 beauty company KIKI World has built a brand around a burgeoning community of makeup lovers who better want to connect with the makers behind their favorite products – and in the process, help make them.  Using the tech stack built by Co:Create, the KIKI World Membership Pass is an NFT that grants holders access to a DAO where they can pitch ideas for products, vote on upcoming releases and attend exclusive events and experiences.  Brendon Garner, co-founder and chief marketing officer of KIKI World, told CoinDesk that membership programs can use blockchain technology to gamify the user experience and create a more delightful interaction.  “Traditional loyalty and membership spaces have operated like, ‘you get an email discount code one day before the broader public’ or ‘you have some points in Sephora that you can use,’ but is it really that much of an engaging experience?” said Garner. “We set out to use language that's familiar but really create tangible impact out of the gate by rewarding anybody that signs up to be a KIKI World member.”  While NFTs help power the KIKI WORLD membership, the DAO component of their strategy has helped to foster a more interactive community structure – mirroring IRL membership programs but with the added benefits and security of blockchain technology.  “From a conceptual level and from a philosophical level, I think it's very important to be able to reward those who contribute the most and provide them with the ability to actually have an impact on areas that they're passionate about,” said Garner.  Bringing Brands to Fans with Web3  As we look toward the future, tools like NFT loyalty programs, membership rewards or token-gated ticketing provide a robust framework for brands and consumers to ease into Web3. Using NFTs, brands can build a community around their products and connect and reward their most loyal fans for long-term engagement.  Brands can utilize these tools stealthily without turning off new users by focusing on finding the right fit for the technology rather than hopping on a short-term trend. And NFTs don’t need to be marketed as the focus of a brand campaign or Web3 strategy, but instead can be used as a tool to enhance existing programs, inviting mainstream users into the fold in a meaningful and sustainable way.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/06/22/loyalty-memberships-and-ticketing-how-nfts-will-bring-about-mass-adoption,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4b968c34356978758638f2989077b7727dbe75bf-5451x3725.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Identifying counterparties may be important for large regulated institutional players like BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, but it might contradict the privacy ethos of crypto natives. However BlackRock has recently emerged as a potentially priority-setting player in the industry by applying this month to list a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Given its size, its desires might have a greater shot at becoming industry rules than the often-anonymous folks who have long steered crypto.  ""The first issue is, who am I trading with?...We go to jail, if we don't know who we're trading with,"" Chalom said of institutions such as BlackRock, adding that he is not optimistic that the digital identity issue will be solved in the short term.

14093128,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=539201,1687462204,Uniswap Faces Backlash Over Business Source License Imposed On v4 Code,"Uniswap, the top decentralized exchange (DEX) in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) space, has come under fire from developers after imposing a Business Source License (BSL) on its v4 code. According to a report by DL News, this move has restricted other developers from using the code for four years, leading to accusations that Uniswap is betraying its open-source ethos. Uniswap’s Open Source Credibility In Question DeFi developers have complained that many of the new features outlined in Uniswap’s v4 whitepaper are similar to those already released by rival protocols. As such, the decision to use a BSL has cast doubt on the exchange’s commitment to open-source development and prompted some in the DeFi community to question whether Uniswap has plagiarized other protocols’ ideas. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Show Most Active Hour In 3 Months As BTC Breaks $30,000 Uniswap’s decision to impose a BSL license on its v4 code could have several potential consequences for its user base. Firstly, the move could alienate some developers who believe in the importance of open-source development and collaboration. This could lead to a loss of trust in Uniswap and a shift towards other decentralized exchanges that have a more open approach to code sharing. Additionally, the BSL license could limit the number of developers who can work on Uniswap’s code, which could slow down innovation and the development of new features. This could put Uniswap at a disadvantage compared to other decentralized exchanges that are more open to collaboration and innovation. Furthermore, the BSL license could limit the number of forks of Uniswap’s code, which could reduce the competition in the DeFi space. While this could be seen as a positive for Uniswap, it could also lead to a lack of innovation and a stagnation of the DeFi ecosystem as a whole. Finally, the controversy around the BSL license could damage Uniswap’s reputation and lead to a loss of users who are concerned about the exchange’s commitment to open-source development Uniswap Denies Plagiarism Accusations Nevertheless, Uniswap’s defenders argue that the exchange has not copied others’ work and that using a BSL is a sound way to protect the exchange’s hard work. They also point out that Uniswap is free to choose the license it sees fit. Even though many DeFi developers believe that making code fully open source is beneficial to the industry as it allows for collaboration and often improves the security of the code. Uniswap is currently the top decentralized exchange, but it has faced challenges in the past. In 2020, Uniswap suffered a “vampire attack” from the then newly-launched exchange Sushiswap. By protecting its code with a BSL license, Uniswap is likely trying to avoid a similar situation in the future. Related Reading: ‘Ripple (XRP) Is A Must-Hold For The Next Bull Run,’ Says Bitcoin Maxi Despite the controversy, some DeFi developers believe that using a BSL makes sense and is a decision that keeps many “dumb forks” from existing. The allegations of plagiarism have further complicated the issue. Several members of the DeFi community have accused Uniswap of copying ideas from rival protocols and then trapping them behind the BSL license. While it is difficult to say if any copying took place, the accusations have raised concerns about the exchange’s practices and the future of open-source development in the DeFi space.

42420138,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUa0An,1687459812,Solana-Based Crypto Lending Platform Jet Pivots to Fixed-Rate Term Lending,"The Solana-based crypto lending platform Jet is relaunching with fixed-rate loans, taking a page from traditional finance even as the majority of its crypto rivals cling to variable rate products.  Jet uses an order book design where borrowers and lenders set their own terms, including the level of interest rates and payback timelines.  “It's not some artificially derived APY,” or annualized percentage yield, said founder James Moreau. “It's entirely market-based.”  That’s how most capital moves through the global economy. In crypto, things are different; lending protocols advertise ever-changing interest rates that can climb sky-high and crash in the same day. The upside is that you might make a lot of money by taking a lot of risk. The downside is that you probably won’t.  Even with less risk, Moreau said, Jet’s model faces some friction from big traders like market makers who have grown used to the flexibility of variable-rate products, where they can often pull their money at any time (assuming the utilization rate isn't too high, of course). With a fixed-rate product their crypto is locked for the length of the contract.  Jet’s own performance metrics – like almost every Solana protocol – have fallen sharply from their highs in late 2021, when the protocol had over $36 million in total value locked, according to DeFLlama. These days it is under $200,000.  Moreau admits it's unlikely that fixed-rate lending products will provide the spark for a rush of liquidity returning to Solana. But he’s hopeful that the product can appeal to a niche of DAOs and other on-chain organizations who have large, dormant treasuries they can put to use.  Traders of staked SOL can also find “a very easy use case” for acquiring easy money through Jet, Moreau said. He’s targeting those who are engaged in maximal extractable value (MEV) strategies and staked SOL.  “We basically want to see as much of the lending money get borrowed as possible, and so that's what I'm working on,” Moreau said.",NEUTRAL,SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | SOL,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/06/22/solana-based-crypto-lending-platform-jet-pivots-to-fixed-rate-term-lending,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/86aa5b08b8a470600e509d054686dc3caac8b93b-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Sun’s crypto wallet received a total of 15,805 ETH from Lido’s withdrawal address on Thursday after requesting to unstake the tokens the day before, data by blockchain monitoring platform Arkham Intelligence shows.  A few minutes later, the wallet deposited 15,815 ETH to Huobi through an intermediary address, according to Arkham. Sending tokens to an exchange often signals intention to sell.  The transactions happened as ETH, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, gained almost 16% through the week, surging past $1,900 from a low of $1,630, CoinDesk data shows.  Crypto markets, led by bitcoin (BTC), rallied through the week as investors cheered the news that a slew of traditional financial institutions took steps to get more involved with digital assets. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, filed to register a much-coveted spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) last Thursday.

Blockchain data shows that Sun also deposited 1,000 BTC to Huobi early Wednesday, when the token was trading near $29,000.

14091637,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=539198,1687458612,Expert Analysis: IMF Documents And XC Platform Raise Concerns For XRP,"The IMF has often recognized crypto assets, especially Ripple (XRP), as instruments facilitating cross-border payments and remittances. Reuters reported that the International Monetary Fund IMF plans to launch a platform to facilitate CBDC creations and transactions. These mentions have always excited the XRP community. But recently, a prominent XRP influencer opined that the new XC platform and IMF cross-border documents are not pro-XRP. IMF Documents and Upcoming Platform Don’t Directly Favor XRP WrathofKahneman took to Twitter to quell the anticipation that the IMF favors XRP directly. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Appears To Be Fueled By Derivatives, Will It Last? The influencer wrote; Man, the IMF docs are neither pro-XRP nor the XC platform. There are 3 docs worth reading to decide for yourself. Recall that in 2018, the International Monetary Fund organized a presentation captioned The Regulation of Virtual Currencies. The body classified XRP as a coin for digital payments highlighting that it can facilitate cross-border payment, which has been a challenge for central banks. Also, earlier in February, the IMF published a paper recognizing the importance of crypto assets such as XRP for cross-border payments and remittances. Then on June 19, the IMF published another paper stating it plans to push through the launch of an XC platform where many wholesale central bank digital currency projects will interoperate. According to the IMF report, this is an evolution of wholesale CBDC, which is both a settlement asset and infrastructure—a platform, really. But according to WOK, the XRP community exaggerated the whole plan implying support for Ripple. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Become Greedy For First Time Since May In his tweet, WOK added the documents about the first XC platform proposal, the recent IMF report, and even director Tobias Adrian’s comments. He stated clearly that these documents didn’t only mention Ripple but also pointed at its rivals, Bitcoin Lightning Network and Stellar Blockchain, implying that the network wasn’t unique as touted. Regarding the XC platform, WOK said, “I think the IMF is trying to envision a single global cross-border clearinghouse. It’s cool but hard to imagine major economies sharing exposure so nakedly. They mention blockchain/crypto need not be used at all.” International Monetary Fund is Aware of Ripple and Stellar But Didn’t Indicate Adoption, WOK WOK’s tweet sparked discussion around the topic and Twitter user Salvacrypto asked him if the IMF’s mention of Stellar or Ripple could increase the probability of adopting the assets for future cross-border payments models or decrease it. The user even told him to give an honest answer. In response, WOK said, “If pushed, I would say slightly increase because it indicates to me they are aware of the XRPL and Ripple. But that doesn’t mean planning for them.” Following WOK’s answer, Salvacrypto responded that the XRP community members are excited that such recognition by IMF “stacks the chips in their favor.” XRP is currently changing hands at $0.499 at the time of this writing, up 1.34% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Coinmarketcap.

However, in a somewhat unexpected turn of events, this morning, we saw both Bitcoin (BTC) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) surge in price. And as both tokens’ prices continue to go up, both Bitcoin (BTC) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) join Tradecurve (TCRV) as the top three best cryptocurrencies to buy now. But TCRV leads the way with its never-before-seen utility and game-changing potential. >>BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW Bitcoin (BTC)’s Unexpected Surge Before settling at its current price, Bitcoin (BTC) temporarily shot up to $138,000 Binance earlier today. However, this doesn’t depict the real Bitcoin (BTC) price, as it was probably caused by a glitch and was gone in a few seconds. Regardless, Bitcoin (BTC) holders were pleasantly surprised to see Bitcoin (BTC) surge this morning, increasing by almost $2,000 per Bitcoin (BTC) token compared to two days ago. Now, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $28,972.09, an 8.16% increase in the past 24 hours. The Bitcoin (BTC) market cap and trading volume are also up by 8.19% and 80.65%, respectively. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Is Recovering Shiba Inu (SHIB) has become one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy again, as it managed to finally break out of its downward streak. This surge in price can be attributed to Shiba Inu (SHIB) whales, who recently moved 21 billion SHIB over to Binance. However, even though Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently on the come-up, you should keep in mind that maybe those billions of Shiba Inu (SHIB) have been moved to be sold later on. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading at $0.000007367, a 2.41% increase since yesterday. The Shiba Inu (SHIB) market cap is also up by 2.51%, and the Shiba Inu (SHIB) trading volume is up by 41.53%. Tradecurve (TCRV) – The Most Promising and Profitable Project in 2023 The best out of the three cryptocurrencies mentioned here is Tradecurve (TCRV). Why? Because Tradecurve brings a breath of fresh air into the market, giving access to something that has never been done before.

Also, it has a borderless nature, meaning that it’s accessible worldwide.

The meme coin has mirrored the general market sentiment and has been able to embark on an upward rally that has seen it rise double-digits in the last two days. The recovery in SHIB’s price is partly attributed to the fact that Bitcoin was able to clear the $30,000 else on Wednesday. However, on its own, the digital asset has also seen some developments that have contributed to the bullish sentiment among community members, leading to more buying activity compared to the sellers. Shiba Inu Burn Ramps Up The Shiba Inu burn has been in motion for about two years now as community members work toward reducing the number of total SHIB tokens in circulation. The first significant burn was that of Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin which saw him burn around half of the total supply sent to him, leading to a massive rally. Related Reading: US Bitcoin Investor Trading Volume Rises, Stage Set For Another Massive Rally? After this, the Shiba Inu community burn was implemented to burn more tokens. Over time, the burn has caught on and now SHIB tokens are being sent to the burn address on a daily basis and the past day was no exception. In the last day, Shibburn, a website dedicated to tracking the number of tokens burned, reported that over 341.5 million tokens were burned across five transactions. The majority of the burn was from two addresses with one wallet burning 252,873,213 tokens and the other carrying a total of 84,405,747 tokens. In the past 24 hours, there have been a total of 341,504,230 $SHIB tokens burned and 5 transactions.

SHIB price recovers above $0.000008 | Source: SHIBUSD on TradingView.com On the weekly chart, the meme coin has performed splendidly as data from Coinmarketcap shows that Shiba Inu’s price is up more than 22% already. This boost in price saw the market cap of the digital asset rise above $4.7 billion, putting it ahead of Toncoin (TON) and allowing it to reclaim its position as the 14th largest cryptocurrency in the market.

42420133,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUa04b,1687453435,Brian Armstrong Envisions Coinbase Eventually Becoming a 'Super App',"NEW YORK — Coinbase (COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong, undeterred by the recent consequential lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), retains a grand vision for the exchange's platform to become a global ""super app"" like the popular WeChat.  Super apps bundle together a wide array of activities like financial services, booking appointments with a doctor and much more. Tencent's WeChat is one of best-known.  In Asia, for ""some time ... people have apps that they use [for] digital money in all kinds of areas of their life,"" he said Thursday at the State of Crypto Summit organized by Coinbase and the Financial Times in New York.  ""I think that in Coinbase, this case, we want to be that super app, but it's all going to be based on these decentralized protocols,"" Armstrong said, adding that the app will be used not just for money and assets, but also for social interactions.  A decentralized application, or dapp, is like the programs found in mobile devices but with the added feature that they use blockchain technology. By decentralizing, dapps can create a digital economy of peer-to-peer services that keeps users' data out of the reach of large organizations behind it.  The SEC recently accused Coinbase, one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, of operating as an unregistered broker, exchange and clearing agency at the same time, soliciting customers, handling orders, allowing for bids and acting as an intermediary all at once, in violation of U.S. securities laws.

42420140,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUa0Bp,1687452906,How Financial Advisors Can Navigate Crypto’s Turbulent Waters,"We continue to live through crypto history. Regulators recently moved aggressively forward with some major initiatives in the cryptocurrency space. There’s a lot to unpack there, and I won’t get into the specifics, but overall, the developments give the industry a chance to have meaningful discussions with the SEC about the future of crypto. A courtroom is a type of forum, and it might be the platform the industry needs to move forward.  In some ways, it’s expected. Crypto investors had a rough 2022: Faced with the inevitable growing pains of early-stage innovation and the shameless opportunists that always appear in emerging industries, many felt the effects of mismanaged funds and elite fraud. Bankruptcy hearings echoed with voices of investors who’d kept all of their metaphorical eggs in one basket, revealing to the courts that millions of dollars were lost in yield-bearing cryptos that they’d left sitting in one failed exchange. While it appears the industry has found its footing, the SEC may feel once bitten, twice shy.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  But the question remains: How do we guide clients through these turbulent times? The most recent lawsuits served by the SEC don’t seem to have cooled interest from investors in digital assets. Far from it: we see on-chain traffic flocking to DeFi protocols that support staking and decentralized trading.  Unlike past disruptions where centralized exchanges were challenged, outflows from institutions like Coinbase appear to have stabilized quickly, demonstrating that investors might be staying put and, therefore, need more guidance than ever before.  While it’s important to keep an eye on the evolving regulatory landscape for guidance, there are some ways advisors can exert more caution when addressing or investing in cryptocurrencies with interested clients.  The importance of held-away and crypto apps  One of the major benefits of blockchain is the autonomy it provides investors. The freedom to trade whenever and wherever is a powerful tool for the democratization of investing, and while there are trade-offs that come with the inherent responsibility it requires, it’s overall a positive step in the direction of financial equality.  FAs and RIAs know that responsibility well, and even though you can manage digital assets directly with the right tools, you don’t want to completely squash this new-found independence (and it’s unlikely that anyone could). As investors learned last year, the new freedom of completely limitless, do-it-yourself mobile trading apps made the need for outside advising feel superfluous until, under regrettable circumstances, it became very clear that it wasn’t.  This is where held-away comes in. You can support this new hybrid style of managed investing — where custody remains with a third party — with tools that let you view your clients’ held-away investing accounts (through Coinbase or Gemini) to provide insights when your clients want to take the reins.  Taking a qualified, multi-custodial approach  Another big takeaway from the past year and the many exchange failures is the importance of diversification. Stories abound of investors who put entire college funds in one application to gain interest and fell victim to poor lending practices. It’s important to invest intelligently and mitigate risk by diversifying holdings and leveraging tools that let you invest for clients across a variety of trusted exchange platforms.  It’s also important to know how custodians are holding your funds. Qualified custodians allow investors to leverage different forms of custody for client funds that are secured, vetted, and can utilize hot and cold wallet technology. While we closely vet our custodian partners to be sure they can offer qualified investing solutions, it’s always important when investing on behalf of clients to understand the methods used by the exchanges you’re using.  Maintain a diverse portfolio  Modern Portfolio Theory still applies to digital asset management. Investors that experienced major losses weren’t just all-in on specific apps — they were also all-in on specific cryptocurrencies. The potential for high returns on exchange-offered, yield-bearing assets led many investors to put large sums of capital into one vehicle (think: Terra Luna). Similar to the early days of tech, it’s easy for clients to get caught up in the hype and potentially buy into inflated assets with high-risk profiles.  This makes DYOR (doing your own research) incredibly important in a space that evolves fast. Leveraging indices and models from experts in the digital asset space can be incredibly helpful in these scenarios. That way, you can spread investment capital across various digital asset allocations guided by market research and analysts in the field.  Also, diversification doesn’t just have to be within the realm of crypto. We say “digital assets” for a reason, and it’s because there are several ways to engage blockchain outside of cryptocurrencies to diversify. Tokenized assets (a.k.a. real-world assets or RWAs) like private equity, real estate, and art, among other alternatives, are giving investors the ability to broaden their digital asset exposure through access to otherwise restricted investment vehicles.  Stay on the pulse  As the regulatory landscape evolves, so must you. Although the wheels of legislation turn slowly, and these court cases may take years to resolve, the opportunity for real discourse can lead to collective problem-solving and, ultimately, clarity in the space. Keep a close eye on asset designations and key findings to be sure you’re investing in the most compliant, intelligent way possible.  Today’s investor knows the benefits of digital assets, and 50 million of them are already invested in crypto. Advisors have the ability to offer them your knowledge, financial education, and experience to help guide them when they need it most. I firmly believe that RIAs will pave the way for digital assets because you have the power to bring out the best in this emerging space and enable it to do what it was invented to do – make the financial system work for everyone.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Eric Ervin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/06/22/how-financial-advisors-can-navigate-cryptos-turbulent-waters,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/940c9875c1c095bd60077b25908a39e04bee5684-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420143,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUa0Dt,1687451908,Bitcoin’s Ferocious ETF-Fueled Rally Puts Ether at Weakest Price Versus BTC in 2 Months,"The price ratio between ether (ETH) and bitcoin (BTC), a commonly watched metric for the biggest cryptocurrencies, sank to a two-month low as a traditional finance giant's plan for a BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) dramatically shifted sentiment in the industry.  ETH's price divided by BTC's has fallen to 0.0615, according to data from TradingView. The drop reflects bitcoin's far bigger gain this month: a 10% surge versus ETH's 1% increase.  Bitcoin has risen this week as markets more fully absorbed BlackRock's application for a spot bitcoin ETF and re-filings for similar products by well-known financial services firms Invesco and WisdomTree.  BTC has likely also benefited from its omission among 19 listed tokens in lawsuits earlier this month by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against exchanges Binance and Coinbase, Anthony Georgiades, co-founder of Pastel Network, told CoinDesk. Those other tokens dropped by double digits in the days following the suits, although they’ve recovered in this week’s market rebound.  “With regulatory uncertainty around labeling certain digital assets as securities, bitcoin is the only digital asset to remain – in the lens of regulatory agencies – sufficiently decentralized and certainly not a security,” said Georgiades.  Georgiades noted that if there are no exogenous shocks, like a credit crisis, the market might expect certain speculation or trading rotation to drive inflows from BTC into ETH. “Ethereum’s unique aspects, such as its ability to facilitate a wide range of applications from DeFi to NFTs, is a key differentiator from Bitcoin and presents unique value propositions,” he said.  According to Nauman Sheikh, head of protocol and treasury management at Wave Digital Assets, bitcoin’s upcoming halving next year has also further bolstered bitcoin’s position. He added that “bitcoin's dominance is unlikely to fade in the near future. As a result, the ETH/BTC ratio has hit a 2023 low at 0.0615. However, this ratio could further decline to the 0.05 to 0.055 range last seen in the summer of 2022, which may present an opportune moment for investors to favor ethereum over bitcoin.”",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/22/bitcoins-ferocious-etf-fueled-rally-puts-ether-at-weakest-price-versus-btc-in-months,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6fcdc0fd0a13da06491506f99dc27f9dc73c9c5b-2672x1216.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Nevada-based Prime Trust on Thursday shut off all fiat and crypto deposits and withdrawals following an order from state financial regulators, according to multiple clients whose money is now stranded.  TrueUSD has said it no longer uses Prime Trust to mint or redeem the TUSD stablecoin and maintains “multiple USD rails” elsewhere. The usually stable asset has fallen as low as $0.995 and climbed as high as $1.003 since June 9, when Prime Trust’s financial crisis began to deepen.  That volatility has rocked usually quiet loan markets for TUSD, especially on Aave v-2, the largest on-chain lending facility for TUSD. At press time, the variable borrow rate for TUSD was over 30% APR; it was even higher earlier in the day, according to Parsec.  The hefty rates were not dissuading traders betting that TUSD could depeg in major fashion.

Following its breakthrough at the $0.000007 threshold, the token price has been on a nearly 20% price upswing. What could be driving the price of SHIB? Is the token heading for the $0.00001 price level? Shiba Inu Price Action – Journey To $0.00001? Indeed, Shiba Inu’s sustained price rally can be attributed to different factors, including exciting project updates. But, the positive social sentiment surrounding the cryptocurrency seems to be the major driving force behind its price. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Positive Social Sentiment Sparks Bullish Speculation According to data from CoinGecko, SHIB trades at $0.00000839, with a 14% price increase in the last 24 hours. A broader look at the market shows that the token has performed even better in the past week, recording a 25% price jump. It is worth noting that the Shiba Inu token has just only begun its recovery, having been on a downtrend since the beginning of February. On February 5, the coin reached its 2023 peak – so far – at $0.00001473, which means it is still on a 43% price decline. That said, SHIB looks set for the psychological $0.00001 price level, although it faces significant resistance at $0.0000084. If it manages to break through this threshold, a rally to $0.00001 is only then likely.

Shiba Inu Announces The Imminent Release Of The “Worldpaper” On Wednesday, June 21, Shytoshi Kusama published a blog post on the Shiba Inu website, providing updates on the meme-inspired ecosystem. Following its teaser video on his Twitter, the Shiba Inu lead developer took a deep dive into the new “Shibacals”, dissecting what the project means for the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Shytoshi also announced the impending release of the “Worldpaper”. This document is expected to contain the long-term plan for full and complete decentralization, new official partners (and a recap of current ones), and other information.

42420146,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUa0Gz,1687451142,Pepecoin Becomes Biggest Meme Coin Gainer With 70% Weekly Jump,"Takeaways:  Pepecoin (PEPE) has seen a huge gain this week amid a broader crypto rally, outperforming other meme coins like SHIB, FLOKI and DOGE.  Futures products tied to PEPE saw unusually large liquidations, suggesting short covering – or traders exiting bearish bets on the meme coin's price – might be exaggerating the size of the gain.  Pepecoin (PEPE) surged as much as 40% in the past 24 hours to extend weekly gains to over 70% amid a market-wide rally led by bitcoin (BTC).  Trading volumes for the frog-themed tokens jumped to over $800 million, CoinGecko data shows, as a risk-on environment likely fueled outsized bets on riskier assets, such as altcoins and meme coins.  PEPE gains were significantly higher than meme tokens shiba inu (SHIB), floki (FLOKI) and dogecoin (DOGE) – even as developers of some of these tokens introduced ecosystem upgrades – suggesting high buying interest for pepecoin.  Futures contracts tracking PEPE had more than $13 million of liquidations. Potentially, this may have contributed to the price spike as short positions – or bets that the price of PEPE would fall – were settled. Only bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) futures liquidations have been greater.  Read more: Research Shows Majority of Pepe Investors Caught in High-Stakes Game of Musical Chairs  Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).  Large liquidations can signal a top or bottom of a steep price move, which may allow traders to position themselves accordingly.  As such, funding rates in perpetual futures tied to PEPE futures remain negative, indicating the dominance of bearish positions in the derivatives market. A negative funding rate indicates that shorts are dominant and are willing to pay longs to keep their bearish bets open.  Bitcoin crossed the $30,000 mark on Wednesday amid a flurry of Bitcoin ETF filings by traditional finance players in the U.S., which likely spurred bullish sentiment among traders and led to a market-wide rally.

42420134,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUa06f,1687448655,This Is How Scammers Can Drain Your Crypto Wallet,"Scammers spun up at least 7,905 blockchain wallets in May to collect crypto they steal from ordinary users, according to a blockchain security company Forta Network.  Forta, which has recently launched its own token, operates a network of bots that detect various kinds of scams on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Optimism, Avalanche, Arbitrum and Fantom blockchains.  Christian Seifert, researcher-in-residence at Forta who previously worked at Microsoft’s security research division, told CoinDesk that Forta’s algorithms can detect various kinds of anomalous behavior while scanning transactions on blockchains.  Some of those anomalies are attacks on users’ wallets.  For some of the attacks, scammers rely on social engineering – sniffing around for user's personal information or deploying tricks to get crypto users to reveal their passwords or seed phrases. Other attacks only require knowing a victim’s wallet address.  See also: Calling a Hack an Exploit Minimizes Human Error | Opinion  “A lot of attacks are social engineering attacks: users are being lured to a website, a website asks them to connect their wallet, a transaction pops-up, a user approves it and their money is gone,” Seifert said.  ‘Ice phishing’  The most prevalent kind of attack in May was the so-called “ice phishing” technique, which accounted for 55.8% of all the attacks registered by Forta. Unlike the more obvious or well-known phishing attacks (ice phishing is a play on the more common “phishing” attacks seen across the Web), this type does not aim directly for users’ private information.  Instead, an ice phisher tricks a victim into signing a malicious blockchain transaction that opens access to the victim’s wallet so the attacker can steal all the money. In such cases, victims are often lured onto a phishing website designed to mimic real crypto services.  These scams rely on ""token approval"" transactions, one of the most common uses for non-custodial Web3 wallets that enable users to grant smart contracts a certain amount of access to their wallets.  On its support page, MetaMask, the makers of the most popular Ethereum crypto wallet note that when granting token approval transactions ""you're firmly in control and hold ultimate responsibility for everything you do. That's why it's critical you know exactly what you're signing up for when you confirm token approvals.""  In a similar scam to the one mentioned above, attackers attempt to trick users into interacting with various decentralized applications (dapps), including decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Such schemes often create an illusion of a new lucrative opportunity, like an airdrop of some new token, and exploit the common tendency to fall for FOMO, or the fear of missing out, Seifert said.  However, instead of interacting with a legitimate service, a user forfeits control over their assets to an attacker by signing a token approval transaction.  “Users click, click, click and transactions pop-up, often with a timer, and users approve them without checking,” Seifert said.  According to Seifert, there are two crucial steps to ice phishing: “luring a victim onto a [malicious] website and creating a positive narrative.  “A variation of the ice phishing attack is to trick users into sending native assets to the scammer directly. This is achieved by signing a 'security update' function of the scammer's contract,” Seifert said, adding that usually, small amounts of crypto is stolen this way.  NFTs, airdrops and address poisoning  Some attacks target traders of non-fungible tokens (NFT). For example, scammers have developed techniques that takes advantage of quirks in NFT infrastructure, like the Seaport protocol introduced by OpenSea and used across many NFT marketplaces. To sell NFTs on Seaport, users create sell orders by signing a transaction that is broadcasted locally on the platform – rather than the wider Ethereum network, to save money on transaction fees.  Attackers sniff around for users with valuable NFTs and try trick them into approving transactions that would sell their valuable holdings at a fraction of the market price.  NFT traders today are often aware of the many ways they can be exploited. Some of the highest-profile crypto heists in recent years have targeted influential NFT figures. This has led to evermore targeted and sophisticated phishing attacks.  For the “address poisoning” attack, attackers study the transaction history of their victims’ wallets and look for addresses they interact with the most. They then create a blockchain address that would look familiar to their target and send the victim a transaction with little-to-no value. This transaction is meant to “poison” an intended victim's transaction history by putting the malicious address in a place where they may mistakenly copy and paste it when they make their next transaction.  But often, the simplest exploits remain effective. For instance, Seifert said attackers often use recognizable brands when designing social engineering exploits that earn victims’ trust or attention. That was the case with the fraudulent tLINK token that Chainlink (LINK) holders received in early June, when an attacker airdropped a supposedly new token to the LINK holders.  The scammers included an offer for users to exchange tLINK for actual LINK tokens on a phishing website in the description field of the airdropped token, Seifert said. And if they took that offer, they would have gotten burned.  What makes such attacks trickier is that attackers can allocate fraudulent ERC-20 tokens to a legitimate smart contract and then execute a function that transfers those fake tokens to anyone that holds a targeted token, according to Forta. This makes it look like users got an airdrop from the legitimate contract, while it’s nothing but scam.  See also: Preventing Crypto Exploits & Hacks in 2023  Attacks like that do not even require much reconnaissance work from attackers: all they need to know about victims is their wallets addresses.  Transaction hygiene  With hackers and scammers getting ever more industrious, it’s important to always pay attention to the addresses your wallet interacts with, Seifert said.

14087109,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=539175,1687447827,PEPE Surges By 34% Amid General Market Recovery,"Meme season sensation Pepecoin (PEPE) has gained by 34.23% in the last day as the crypto market maintains its Bitcoin-fuelled recovery. According to data from CoinMarketCap, PEPE’s impressive price movement has allowed the token to emerge as the top gainer of the day, outperforming the likes of Conflux (CFX) and Stacks (STX) who have held the headlines in recent days. PEPE initially began the week slowly, showing no significant price movement on Monday, June 19, as it hovered around the price region of $0.000000922. Thereafter, the meme token recorded a slight price gain before hitting a resistance level at 0.00000107 on June 20. Following some sideways movements, PEPE resumed its bullish course to trade as high as $0.00000154 today for the first time since last month. In the last two days, the PEPE has jumped by over 61% in market price. At the time of writing, Pepecoin is trading at $0.00000148, gaining by 3.54% in the last hour based on CoinMarketCap data. The token’s daily trading volume is also up by 253.38%, sitting at $694 million. Related Reading: Crypto Market Sees Liquidations Over $260 Million Amid Bitcoin’s Leap Above $30,000 That said, PEPE’s market cap drifts around $579 million, allowing it to retain its position as the 3rd largest meme coin in the market. Could PEPE’s Market Struggles Be Over? Following its launch in April, PEPE took the crypto world by storm, surging by over 2,000% to become the “undisputed king of the meme season.” However, PEPE soon fell from its sturdy heights sliding by 78% off its all-time high value – 0.00000435 – attained in May. After its market surge today, it appears that PEPE may be on its way back up to this level. Although it is still too early to tell. Based on PEPE’s 1-hour chart, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows the token has just left the overbought zone, indicating the bullish momentum may be over and a bearish trend lies on the horizon. Furthermore, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has crossed below the signal line, which is also considered a bearish signal. Looking at the PEPE’s price action, the token continues to hover around the key resistance level of 0.00000146. If the buying pressure increases and PEPE manages to break through this threshold, it could be back on its bullish course. That said, if the resistance zone holds strong and PEPE fails to break out, this may confirm the initial bearish prediction.

Energy Web, the world’s largest ecosystem of companies using open source, decentralized technologies to accelerate the energy transition, is coming to Polkadot, the next-generation blockchain network powering the movement for a better web. The move will allow Energy Web to create the framework for a new technology, dubbed ‘Energy Web X’, which will help its partners, including major players such as Shell, Vodafone, Volkswagen, and RMI - accelerate their decarbonization strategies. Having developed digital solutions with dozens of major energy companies and non-profit organizations from over 25 countries, Energy Web is focused on two key areas: Firstly, Energy Web wants to help electric utilities digitize and integrate distributed energy resources into the grid. Secondly, Energy Web aims to bring deep transparency and verifiability to emerging green product supply chains – including 24/7 matched renewable electricity, sustainable aviation fuel, and sustainably produced Bitcoin. Jesse Morris, CEO of Energy Web, commented: “Energy Web and our global enterprise partners are collectively on a mission to make clean energy an integral and widely-accessible part of the global electricity system. To achieve this important goal, we decided to search for a blockchain platform that offers real enterprise-grade security and seamless upgradeability to ensure a safe and future-proof environment. Polkadot excels on both of these fronts with its shared security model and best-in-class core technology. We couldn’t be more excited to build out the energy transition vertical on Polkadot.” Adding: “Energy Web X will be based on worker node networks. Each of these is a decentralized group of computers jointly executing sensitive business processes that involve or impact multiple companies. Enterprises will be able to deploy thousands of independent worker nodes, coordinate them in cohesive networks, and allow the public to verify the results of their work.” Björn Wagner, CEO of Parity Technologies, a leading contributor to the Polkadot network, said: “The energy transition vertical is a perfect use case to take advantage of the benefits of blockchain technology, and it’s a space where Polkadot is well positioned to be a market leader. We’re especially pleased to see Polkadot bring competitive advantages to initiatives and enterprises making a positive environmental and social impact. In choosing to build a custom Polkadot parachain, Energy Web will get the performance and security its industry partners require and faster time to market and access to Polkadot’s best-in-class interoperability. I’m excited to partner with the Energy Web team to accelerate the transition to clean energy.” Energy Web will launch a bid for a parachain slot on Polkadot to build a thriving ecosystem focused on the global energy transition. Further details about Energy Web X’s plans will be revealed at Polkadot Decoded, the network’s flagship summit, in Copenhagen, June 28-29. Ana Trbovich, vice chair of the Energy Web Foundation, will also appear on a regulatory panel at the event. The announcement comes soon after other big names from the music, gaming and accounting industries joined the Polkadot blockchain. The Energy Web X parachain will join the many other projects built on the Polkadot Relay Chain. By the end of Q1, 42 parachains had joined Polkadot, representing sectors such as decentralized finance (DeFi), privacy, social media, sustainability, NFTs, gaming, and the metaverse. Many of these parachains are platforms in themselves, collectively hosting hundreds of Web3 applications. Parachains help projects expand at scale by leveraging each other’s strengths to unlock new use cases and enjoy the shared security advantages provided by Polkadot. About Energy Web Energy Web is a global non-profit on a mission to accelerate the transition to cleaner, more renewable energy sources by developing and deploying open-source Web3 technologies that help companies unlock business value from clean and distributed energy resources. It has partnerships with Shell, Engie, Elia Group, Singapore Power Group, and AEMO. About Polkadot Polkadot is a network that provides the technical advances necessary to make blockchain technology practical, accessible, scalable, interoperable and future-proof. It removes limitations and barriers to entry and fuels innovation, growing the decentralized technology space and bringing the Web3 vision to life. About Parity Technologies Parity Technologies has offices in Berlin, London and Lisbon, staffed by some of the world’s leading blockchain innovators, core engineers, Rust developers, and solutions architects.

14085630,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=539153,1687444219,Avalanche Coin Teeters At Crucial Price Level: Which Way Will it Swing?,"Avalanche (AVAX) has experienced a significant price increase, surpassing a crucial barrier in recent trading sessions. In the past 24 hours, AVAX saw a 6% rise, while its weekly chart shows a notable appreciation of over 17%. However, the technical outlook for Avalanche suggests mixed signals with a slight inclination toward bearish momentum in the market. Although there have been attempts to recover demand, it has not shown significant improvement, and accumulation remains low according to the chart. While Bitcoin has re-entered the $30,000 price level, leading to optimism in the altcoin market, including Avalanche, it is important to note that Avalanche and other altcoins have not completely overcome their challenges. Related Reading: AVAX Breaches $13 Barrier With 16% Rally – What’s The Next Price Level To Watch? For AVAX to see a bullish trend, it must surpass a crucial barrier of $13, allowing the bulls to gain control of the price. Additionally, the stability of Bitcoin’s price is essential for overall market strength. AVAX has experienced a decline in market capitalization, indicating reduced buying power reflected on the chart. Avalanche Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, AVAX was trading at $12.90. Avalanche is currently making efforts to prevent a depreciation in its price following its breakthrough of the $12 resistance level. Although AVAX briefly moved above $13, it experienced a slight decline in its value during recent trading sessions. In order for the bulls to take control, Avalanche needs to surpass the $13 mark and breach the resistance level of $15. If AVAX continues to trade around the current price level, it may be pushed towards its nearest support at $12.40, and potentially even below $12. This is because the volume of AVAX traded in the last session was red, indicating strong selling pressure. Technical Analysis Following AVAX’s successful breach of the $12 level, there was a gradual recovery in buying strength. However, at the current moment, selling strength has taken over. This is indicated by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) being below the halfway line, suggesting that sellers have the upper hand in the market. Additionally, AVAX has dipped below the 20-Simple Moving Average line, further confirming the dominance of sellers in driving the price momentum. For demand to revive, it is crucial for AVAX to rise above the $13 level and sustain that upward movement On the one-day chart, AVAX has shown buy signals, suggesting a possible price reversal. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has formed green histograms, indicating positive price momentum and potential buying opportunities. Related Reading: Solana Bulls Must Overcome This Resistance To Avoid A 10% Plunge However, these buy signals may diminish if the price fails to stay above the $13 resistance level. In terms of price volatility and fluctuation, the Bollinger Bands have widened. This widening indicates that AVAX may experience increased volatility in the upcoming trading sessions.

Crypto firms are increasingly turning to AI, either to complement revenue streams or to enhance products and features. After a crypto winter and regulatory crackdown that has soured investor and public attitudes towards digital assets, AI is emerging as the new tech darling.  The Kaito search engine launched in Beta mode to 35,000 waitlisted users on June 20, according to a company LinkedIn post. It combines large language models (LLMs) with real-time access to data from the web, including Twitter, Discord, Telegram, governance forums, Medium, Mirror, industry research, news, Kaito’s proprietary Twitter Space and podcast transcripts, as well as onchain data. ""Even with plugins, ChatGPT today does not connect to many off-chain crypto-specific information silos or on-chain data, thereby unable to meet people's needs in the [crypto] space,"" said Yu Hu, Kaito's founder and CEO.  LLMs, like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard are artificial neural networks trained on large datasets of language, such that they can understand and generate human-like texts. Due to their proficiency with language, LLMs can understand complex concepts and explain them to users in an approachable way.  The new funding was led by early-stage crypto venture capital (VC) firm Superscrypt and Spartan. It follows a $5.3 million raise led by tech VC Dragonfly and included Sequoia Capital China and Jane Street in February.  CoinDesk had a chance to try out Kaito's search prompts. When we asked it about the hottest topic within the industry right now: how will the launch of an exchange-traded fund by an arm of BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, impact bitcoin, the chabot linked ten news article on the topic and generated an ambivalent answer.  ""The potential approval of Blackrock's Bitcoin ETF could have a positive impact on the crypto market, as it would make investing in BTC easier for institutional investors and increase institutional adoption,"" Kaito AI said.  ""However, there is also some doubt about the impact of the ETF on the market, as some reports suggest that the effects of the Bitcoin halving may be overblown. Overall, it seems that the impact of the Blackrock ETF on the Bitcoin market is still uncertain and will depend on a variety of factors,"" it added.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | RESEARCH,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/06/22/startup-kaito-gets-875m-valuation-in-new-funding-to-build-ai-search-engine-for-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1d1549aa59f01c6f388c6a3ac4e31076c2d2e98a-3648x2048.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42420147,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUa0Fx,1687442400,Northstake Raises $3M to Boost Institutional Crypto Staking,"Northstake, a cryptocurrency staking platform aimed at institutional investors, raised 2.8 million euros ($3 million) from PreSeed Ventures, Morph Capital, The Aventures Fund, Funfair Ventures and Delta Blockchain Fund.  The Copenhagen-based company, which saw over $80 million in crypto assets staked in 2022, takes care of the legal and technical sides of staking – the process of supporting a public blockchain such as Ethereum by posting collateral to the network in return for yield – in a regulatory compliant manner.  There are great expectations within crypto for financial institutions to get some exposure to staking crypto, particularly now that Ethereum, the second largest blockchain, has transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus system.  Northstake simplifies the process while keeping compliance in mind through partnerships with custody technology firm Fireblocks and blockchain analytics provider Chainalysis. The Danish firm is courting interest from sovereign wealth funds and the like, CEO Jesper Johansen said.  “Institutional investors at the asset manager level, at the sovereign fund level are looking at this and trying to figure out what staking is and where does the yield come from,” Johansen said in an interview with CoinDesk. “It's significant that, in this round that we raised, one of our ultimate beneficial owners is ATP, a state-owned pension fund in Denmark and one of the largest asset managers in Europe.”  Northstake is focused on vanilla staking products, as opposed to complex decentralized staking protocols offered by providers like Lido or Rocketpool, Johansen said. That's because institutions can’t handle anti-money laundering (AML) risks associated with not knowing who a staking counterparty is, he said, or what type of funds are being funneled through smart contracts.  Kavita Gupta, the founder of Delta Blockchain Fund and an adviser to Northstake, said in a statement: “At Delta, we are bullish on institutional staking services as it allows them to realize the full potential of holding crypto by earning passive income, supporting the network and holding tokens beyond just having them sit as the speculative asset on the balance sheet.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/06/22/northstake-raises-3m-to-boost-institutional-crypto-staking,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/701548251753a48eede329c8d2b4476e6a506b89-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

BitGo ended the process after ""considerable effort and work to find a path forward with Prime Trust,"" the firm tweeted on Thursday. ""This decision was not made lightly and BitGo remains committed to our mission to deliver trust in digital assets.""  Prime Trust has had a rocky journey in recent months. It replaced CEO Tom Pageler in November, and in January laid off around a third of its staff just days after ceasing operations in Texas. Its subsidiary Banq filed for bankruptcy last week. The firm has been losing clients and deposits to competitors for weeks amid mounting concerns over its business, a source at one of its former clients told CoinDesk.  Following BitGo's tweet, crypto exchange Stably told customers that Prime Trust was halting all deposits and withdrawals by order of the Nevada Financial Institution Division. Fellow crypto exchange Coinmetro also said it was unable to process new U.S. dollar transactions because Prime Trust had suspended USD deposits and withdrawals.  Palo Alto, California-based BitGo was itself almost bought by Mike Novogratz's crypto merchant bank Galaxy Digital (GLXY), until the $1.2 billion deal was canceled in August.

Bitcoin Whale Transaction Count Has Observed A Spike Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, 259 whale transactions occurred two hours after the local top that the cryptocurrency has observed during the past day so far. The relevant indicator here is the “whale transaction count,” which measures the total number of Bitcoin transactions taking place on the blockchain that is worth at least $1 million in value. As generally, only the whales are capable of moving such large amounts with a single transfer, these transactions can provide us a hint about the degree of activity that the whales are displaying right now When the value of the whale transaction count is high, it means that there are a high amount of large transactions taking place on the network currently. Naturally, such a trend would imply the whales are highly active at the moment. Since the amounts involved in these transfers are so high, a large number of them taking place at once can cause noticeable fluctuations in the asset’s price. Thus, when the whale transaction count is elevated, the cryptocurrency may become more probable to show high volatility. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Appears To Be Fueled By Derivatives, Will It Last? Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin whale transaction count over the past week: Looks like the value of the metric has been quite high in recent days | Source: Santiment on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin whale transaction count has registered a huge spike during the past day. This extraordinary surge in the indicator occurred around two hours after the asset hit its local top and lasted for around an hour. In this hour, whales made 259 transactions, which is the most amount in over three months. As for the implication of this spike on the price of the asset, as mentioned before, high values of the indicator can lead to more volatility for the cryptocurrency. Such volatility can go either way, however, as the metric merely counts the pure number of whale transactions happening on the blockchain; it contains no information about whether the transfers have been made for buying or selling purposes. Nonetheless, additional context like the prevailing price trend can perhaps help us guess better about what these whales intended to achieve with these large transactions. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Become Greedy For First Time Since May As the spike in the indicator came just after the BTC top, it’s possible that the whales were looking to sell before the asset saw a further decline. The price continued to go downhill following these transfers, hinting that at least some selling did take place. This drawdown has so far been short-lived, however, as Bitcoin has already recovered back above the $30,000 level. This can be a sign that although some selling may have taken place, it was still at levels low enough that the market was able to absorb it just fine.

The public sale of the first collection of limited-edition NFTs is taking place on June 22 on this unique platform. CUDOS Markets builds upon the success of CUDO Compute and CUDO Miner, leveraging the company’s expertise to create a marketplace for tokenized real-world assets, starting with sustainable Bitcoin (BTC) rewards. As outlined in CUDOS’ roadmap, collectible holders will gain access to Bitcoin rewards, future games that will allow them to win additional hashrate and future drops, including tokenized renewable energy infrastructure. Unlike conventional Bitcoin acquisition, which raises concerns about sustainability and environmental impact, CUDOS Markets ensures that all BTC rewards are sourced exclusively from sustainable and 100% renewable energy sources. This pioneering approach ushers in a new era of responsible cryptocurrency acquisition, empowering individuals to make environmentally conscious choices while benefiting from digital assets. Renowned artist Delux3, formerly a senior designer at Nike, crafted the Genesis collection artwork. Delux3’s signature style of “refined street art” incorporates deep tonal layers and unexpected color combinations. As an established artist in the Solana art world, Delux3’s visionary and abstract contributions to the new Hashrate Collection for CUDOS Markets promise to captivate collectors. The Genesis Collection Public Sale will be offering the opportunity to purchase at a fixed price of $330. Buyers are in with a chance of winning one of the five tiers of hashrate NFTs, with the top tier consistently returning up to 170TH/s throughout a period of four years. Additionally, participants will have a chance to mint one of the three unique one-of-one collectibles concealed within the Genesis collection. The Genesis Collectibles will be backed by Bitcoin hashrate derived solely from preapproved sustainable mining farms, starting with the first Genesis collection from Blockmole. CEO and founder Matt Hawkins shared his thoughts on the latest Cudo Ventures product launch: “Our new product, CUDOS Markets, is not just another NFT marketplace. It’s a platform where people can make a positive impact on the world by buying and selling sustainable NFT collectibles that are real-world assets backed by our ecofriendly Bitcoin miners. With CUDOS Markets, we’re excited to offer a unique opportunity to combine the power of blockchain with our commitment to sustainability and social responsibility.

The proof-of-stake blockchain's upgrade will reduce block time to 3.3 seconds from 3.8 seconds, which is the “largest reduction of block time on a percentage basis,” Algorand Chief Product Officer Paul Riegle told CoinDesk.  The upgrade comes in an increasingly competitive space in which many blockchains have introduced improvements to make themselves more attractive for developers, such as Cardano's latest upgrade this week and BNB Chain’s upgrade last month.  Block time measures how long it takes for the network to produce a new block of transactions.  Other improvements include a simulator that allows developers to test and simulate issues before deploying their codebase to mainnet and a new plugin framework that allows people to create easy, customizable data.  ALGO, the native cryptocurrency for the Algorand blockchain, has increased 4.9% in the past 24 hours to 12.8 cents, according to CoinDesk data.

However, in a sudden turn of events, Crypto Rover, a crypto influencer and Bitcoin devotee, recently confirmed his substantial investment in XRP. The influencer did not only seem to boast its latest XRP purchase but also gave advice in the same tweet that read “Ripple is a must-hold for the next Bull Run.” While this type of word coming from a Bitcoin maxi is quite unusual, there could be possible reasons behind the BTC devotee XRP support. Unforeseen Support For XRP From A Bitcoin Proponent Crypto Rover who is famous for his Bitcoin-centric views recently surprised the crypto community by revealing a major purchase of $250,000 in XRP in recent weeks. He shared this update via a tweet, indicating a departure from his usual investment pattern of Bitcoin holdings. Related Reading: XRP Price Projection: Assessing The Ripple-Colombia Central Bank Partnership According to the influencer, he believes Ripple will emerge winner in its ongoing legal proceedings, which, in his opinion, may lead to a widespread FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) effect. It is worth noting that this factor alone could be one of the reasons behind the Bitcoin Maxi’s sudden support for XRP. Ripple will win the case, and the $XRP FOMO will be insane. I have bought $250,000 worth of #XRP in the past few weeks. I don’t have a lot of #Altcoins in my portfolio now. But Ripple is a must-hold for the next Bull Run. — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) June 21, 2023 Rover’s backing of XRP spurred an enthusiastic reaction from the XRP community, leading to speculation and investment interest. Comments following his announcement range from assertions of Ripple’s stocks and XRP as a ‘must-hold’ to enthusiastic declarations of imminent large XRP purchases, citing it as a ‘lifetime opportunity’. Ripple Court Case – A Deciding Factor For XRP’s Future? Ripple Labs, the firm responsible for the creation of XRP, is currently in a legal dispute with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The crux of the argument revolves around whether XRP should be classified as a security. So far, Ripple Labs has moved to dismiss the lawsuit filed against it by the SEC. The company maintains that XRP, unlike traditional securities, functions as a digital currency due to its utility and decentralized attributes. Ripple is challenging the SEC’s jurisdiction in this matter and criticizes the regulatory body for not providing clear guidance on XRP’s status as a security. The company asserts that the ongoing legal battle has negatively impacted XRP holders and hindered innovation in the crypto industry. As such, the court’s decision on Ripple’s request for dismissal is highly anticipated and could significantly influence the course of the lawsuit. Related Reading: XRP Price Could Regain Strength If It Clears This Resistance If approved, it could pose a serious blow to the SEC’s case and if not, the legal dispute will proceed with the SEC’s allegations against Ripple still in play. Overall, a win for Ripple could potentially influence how digital assets are classified, improving XRP’s standing and possibly enhancing its price. Meanwhile, amid the ongoing legal dispute, XRP is still able to mirror the ubiquitous uptrend in the global crypto market. Over the past 24 hours, XRP has surged 3.5% with a market price above $0.5, at the time of writing.

Bitcoin rose almost 5% in the past 24 hours to $30,219. The cryptocurrency has been on an upward trajectory since last week after BlackRock announced it had applied to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Amongst altcoins, Stacks (STX), the native token of Bitcoin layer 2 Stacks Network, gained 16% on the day. Some traders have been speculating that with the recent positive news for bitcoin from institutional players, other assets related to bitcoin have also performed well. For example, litecoin and bitcoin cash are also up on the week.  CACEIS, the asset servicing arm of banking giants Credit Agricole and Santander, has been registered by French regulators to provide crypto custody services. CACEIS Bank, which provides services to asset managers such as insurers, pension funds and private equity, was registered by the Financial Markets Authority (AMF) as of Tuesday, June 20, according to the regulator’s website. It joins other traditional finance firms such as Societe Generale's Forge and AXA Investment Managers in being recognized under one of the most advanced crypto regulatory frameworks in Europe, as the European Union prepares to impose new crypto licensing rules known as MiCA as of 2024.

42420173,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUa25V,1687435451,"Digital Pound Should Be Interoperable With Crypto, UK Lobbyists Say","Lobby groups and crypto companies in the U.K. are generally welcoming of the government's plans for a digital pound, but some of them believe the currency should be interoperable with crypto in order to be suitable for the future.  The U.K. opened its plans for a digital pound for public comment in February, just as its neighbor, the European Union (EU), pushed ahead with plans for a digital euro. The U.K. government has proposed a “platform model,” where the Bank of England (BoE) would provide infrastructure for a central bank digital currency and allow private companies to integrate and provide wallets to connect to other services.  “A digital pound could bring a number of opportunities from potentially enhancing and improving our existing payment systems; providing an alternative to other forms of payment; and potentially spur further innovation across the sector,” Lisa Cameron, chair of the crypto and digital assets All Party Parliamentary Group said in a statement to CoinDesk.  Responses to the government's plans are now coming in with the deadline for the consultation set to close on June 30. Crypto industry stakeholders are concerned about how users’ privacy will be preserved, and if a digital pound will be designed in an innovation-friendly manner. Others worry the BoE’s planned holding limits for a digital pound are insufficient.  Limits on holdings  The BoE has proposed a limit of 10,000 to 20,000 digital pounds per individual for at least the introductory period of the CBDC. The International Regulatory Strategy Group (IRSG) said it recognizes the need for the U.K. to stay competitive in the digital space but urged the government to consider a lower limit in its response to the BoE.  “The suggestion that limits could be removed after the introductory/transition period is very concerning, particularly given the magnitude of recent bank runs in other jurisdictions,” the IRGS said.  The concern that larger allowances for CBDC holdings would lead to a drain on bank deposits at critical times has been a point of debate among regulators. The EU, by comparison, is going for harder caps on digital euro holdings, while blocking programmability.  ""The open infrastructure of the proposed digital pound could enable programmability or automatic transfers with the help of smart contracts should the government allow it,"" said Kene Ezeji-Okoye, co-founder at U.K.-based blockchain infrastructure provider Millicent.  Smart contracts would not be hosted on the digital pound’s core ledger but could be accessed via an application program interface (API) layer, which would allow companies to connect with its CBDC, the digital pound working paper said. The BoE has already started testing API functionalities for the CBDC with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), an umbrella group of global central banks.  Read more: Central Banks Successfully Test Over 30 CBDC Use Cases, Including Offline Payments  Need for more innovation  The digital pound system might also enable offline payments though this could result in “complexities that affect system security and performance,” the BoE working paper said.  “We believe that the consideration of offline payment[s] should also be of the highest priority,” so that users are consistently able to access their funds, lobby group CryptoUK said in its response to the digital pound consultation.  However, a digital pound would be even more innovative and “future proof,” if it worked with crypto, Varun Paul, director for CBDC at institutional crypto custody platform Fireblocks told CoinDesk in a statement.  The digital pound working paper says the CBDC would be interoperable with cash and bank deposits.  “If the purpose is to ensure uniformity of money and protect privacy in a world of digital assets, then it will need to be able to work with the digital assets of the future, and it will need to be just as easy to use,” Paul said.  Paul said the U.K. central bank needs to develop a token-based solution that “is fit for the future.” The BIS recently shared a proposal for a unified ledger that could facilitate both tokenized assets and CBDCs that it said could enhance the global financial system, although it is uncertain if such a concept would be feasible in reality.  Lobby groups also said that they wanted the digital pound to be used globally.  “Though not in the bank’s near-term ambitions, a digital pound could one day unlock real-time and low-cost cross-border transactions directly from their users’ digital wallets, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing transaction fees,” Adam Jackson, policy advisor at Innovate Finance told CoinDesk in a statement.  Privacy concerns  In their responses to digital pound plans, stakeholders urged the government to take a cautious approach – particularly when it comes to ensuring privacy.  How privacy can be ensured with a digital pound has been something that has been debated by lawmakers. Five stakeholders CoinDesk spoke to, including CryptoUK and IRSG, said they agreed with the government's proposal that the BoE should not have access to users' personal data.  “I think that the model that the bank proposes respects the need for privacy and respects the fact that people don't want the government and the central bank to be able to see their transactions,” Jannah Patchay, executive director of the digital pound foundation said.  Not everyone agrees that the government's proposed approach to preserving privacy – by anonymizing payment messages instructing transfers on the core ledger – would be sufficient.  “Some members are not comfortable with the central bank being able to view even anonymized transactions/wallet balances,” Riccardo Tordera-Ricchi, head of policy at The Payments Association said in a statement. “Those that are skeptical of the central bank’s and the government’s motives might argue that advances in data analysis will allow such data to be interpreted and abused, perhaps through [a] combination with other data sources, including geolocation or tax and benefits data.”  A decision on the issuance of a digital pound is not expected until at least 2025, but should the government proceed to go ahead with this plan, “ensuring the public and consumers have sufficient understanding and trust in any future digital pound will be key to its success,” Cameron said.

The funding initiative was spearheaded by Hashed VC and also saw participation from a host of other investors, including Superscrypt, Lambdaclass, and Crypto.com.The groundbreaking work of Radius, focuses on Practical Verifiable Delay Encryption (PVDE) and Miner Extractable Value (MEV)-resistant ZK-Rollups, a Layer 2 solution. With these innovations, Radius aims to separate the tasks of sequencing and execution, thereby addressing the damaging effects of centralized sequencing where a single entity exercises control over the ordering of transactions in a block. Or in simple words, Radius is making the blockchain more efficient and secure, by preventing the unfair manipulation of transaction orders. We’re incredibly thrilled to announce our $1.7M pre-seed round led by @hashed_official, joined by @superscrypt, @class_lambda, and @Cryptocom_Cap.Radius brings a new paradigm for trustless shared sequencing, revolutionizing the way modular blockchains are built and operated. pic.twitter.com/3QIFHCZLER — Rádius | Trustless Shared Sequencer (@radius_xyz) June 22, 2023 Essentially Radius's PVDE technology helps to protect the privacy of transactions by encrypting them. This makes it harder for anyone to manipulate the order of transactions to their advantage, a practice known as maximum extractable value (MEV). ""We are committed to setting the standard for a trustless shared sequencing layer that not only maximizes revenue for Rollups but also safeguards users from the harmful effects of MEV."" said the founder of Radius, AJ Ji Hoon Park. In addition to PVDE, Radius is also developing an MEV-resistant decentralized exchange named 360, aiming to shield users from front-running bots and sandwich attacks. While the launch date for 360 remains unconfirmed, Radius plans to release an early version of its sequencing layer solution early next year, marking another significant milestone in its journey to reshape blockchain technology.Radius has also announced a partnership with Saga, a Rollup-as-a-Service, and joined the Celestia Ecosystem. This collaboration aims to further advance rollup technology and enhance blockchain ecosystem security. Radius plans to launch an alpha version of its sequencing layer in the first quarter of 2024, marking its commitment to the further development of blockchain technology.

14081226,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=539048,1687433415,"Crypto Market Sees Liquidations Over $260 Million Amid Bitcoin’s Leap Above $30,000","A few hours after Bitcoin scaled the $30,000 mark, the global crypto market has been rocked by substantial liquidations. The past 24 hours alone have seen a drastic exodus of more than $260 million from the crypto market. This significant upheaval underlines the high-stakes, volatile nature of digital currency trading. Notably, traders currently at a loss despite the uptrend in the market are those that took short positions with the hope of the crypto market continuing a downward trend. Sweeping Liquidation Wave Hits Crypto Traders Data from Coinglass reveals that an estimated 65,392 traders and counting had their positions liquidated in the past 24 hours, amounting to cumulative losses above $269 million. This event underscores the risk in crypto trading, particularly during significant market shifts, such as Bitcoin’s recent surge beyond the $30,000 threshold. Binance, a prominent player in the crypto exchange arena, accounted for the most significant slice of these liquidations, totaling $84.79 million. Other exchanges, including OKX with $69.53 million, Bybit with $37.9 million, and Huobi with $32.35 million, also recorded large liquidations. While smaller exchanges also saw liquidations, their impact on the overall market was less severe. Notably, The liquidation wave impacted traders mainly holding short positions, reflecting the majority’s anticipation of a price decrease. These traders bore the brunt of the liquidations, accounting for approximately 80.9% ($218.21 million). Simultaneously, traders holding long positions were not immune to the market’s volatility, with liquidations amounting to nearly 20% of the total ($51.50 million). This underscores that fluctuations in the crypto market can be equally detrimental to both ends of the trading spectrum. A stark illustration of this explosive situation came from Bitmex, where a single trader recorded a massive loss of $9.30 million in an XBTUSD swap, the largest single liquidation in this episode. Bitcoin Latest Price Action Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has made significant moves. The asset has briefly tapped a notable high of above $30,000 a few minutes ago from writing. This surge comes after the asset’s previous blood bath amid the intensified regulatory scrutiny on the largest crypto exchanges that saw its price trade below $25,000. Bitcoin currently trades at $29,991 after briefly climbing above $30,000. Over the past 7 days, Bitcoin’s total market capitalization saw a boost of 15.7%, amounting to an additional $80 billion. The market capitalization of Bitcoin presently hovers at $583.6 billion, an increase from last Wednesday’s $503 billion. Related Reading: Nansen Forecast For Bitcoin Bull Run: Regulatory Clarity And Lower Inflation Bitcoin’s daily trading volume has also surged from a low of around $7 billion last week to as high as above $30 billion in the past 24 hours. This update suggests an increased trading activity of Bitcoin within a span of 7 days. Furthermore, Bitcoin liquidations formed a significant chunk of this turbulence, accounting for $115.76 million. Following Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH) traders witnessed liquidations of $51.94 million, reaffirming the ripple effect across different cryptocurrencies.

42420165,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUa1yH,1687433400,"QCP Capital, SBI Alpha Execute First Uncleared Crypto Options Trade on Regulated Platform Using Bitcoin as Collateral","Singapore-based QCP Capital and Japan-based SBI Alpha Trading on Thursday said they executed an over-the-counter (OTC) crypto options trade on a regulated platform without involving a clearing house, the first such transaction in the digital asset industry.  The so-called uncleared trade negotiated directly between QCP and SBI Alpha used bitcoin (BTC) as collateral and was executed on Clear Markets, operators of a U.S. and U.K.-based regulated electronic marketplace, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk.  London-based Zodia Custody acted as a custodian for collateral while Corda Network, developed by R3, played a role in risk management.  The trade used a multi-custodian collateral network to ensure the assets held in custody remain separate from the custodian's assets. That way, the collateral remains safe if the custodian goes bankrupt.  The trading parties collected the collateral at the start of the transaction and locked the same in an account at an independent custodian, which was controlled by all three parties to mitigate the counterparty risk stemming from the absence of a clearing house. All exchange-traded derivatives and most over-the-counter derivatives involve a clearing house that validates and finalizes the transaction, ensuring the parties to the trade honor their contractual obligations.  QCP and SBI Alpha also introduced a feature allowing real-time bolstering of collateral by periodic payments through the blockchain while protecting the collateral from loss in case of counterparty bankruptcy.  The unique risk management technique is consistent with International Swaps and Derivatives Association's (ISDA) requirements for uncleared derivatives in the multi-trillion dollar fiat currency swap business.  ""This method of managing counterparty credit exposure, derived from traditional financial markets practices, eliminates significant risks taken by counterparties of FTX and other crypto trading units that have collapsed,"" the press release said.  ""This reduces the cost of moving the collateral and enables increased frequency of variation margin payments, reducing the time between price changes and lowering the credit risk,"" the statement added.  12:27 UTC: Updates title and the lede to say the trade was executed on a regulated platform.

Furion addresses a significant challenge in the NFT ecosystem, where non-fungible tokens often suffer from low utilization and limited liquidity. Furion enables the fractionalization of NFTs into corresponding ERC20 tokens. These tokens can be freely traded and farmed on the Furion platform, opening up a world of financial possibilities such as borrowing, lending, and long and short positions. Other technical strengths of Furion's platform include the transformation of NFTs into fungible tokens through smart contracts. This enables collateralized lending between NFTs and mainstream ERC-20 tokens, leveraging peer-to-pool (P2P) operations and calculation logic. By adopting this approach, Furion significantly increases the capital utilization rate of collateral while reducing the risk exposure for lenders through the spread of collateral volatility. Additionally, Furion's integration of an automated market maker (AMM) trading pool enhances liquidation efficiency, ensuring smooth and efficient trading experiences for users. Moreover, the platform enables short selling of NFTs, allowing users to borrow NFT assets by staking stablecoins, selling them at the current market price, and repurchasing them at a lower price to close their positions and make a profit if the NFT asset price falls. The investment of crypto exchange LBank’s venture fund in Furion comes at a time when the NFT market is undergoing rapid growth, with various NFT projects emerging. Recognizing the long-term potential and swift adoption of NFTs, LBank Labs is committed to supporting innovative solutions that contribute to the growth and maturation of the NFT market economy and infrastructure. With $100 million in assets under management, LBank Labs brings financial resources and a global network to Furion. In return, Furion will provide value to Labs, leveraging their expertise and strategic insights for mutual growth. “The dynamic and passionate team of Furion brings a wealth of experience and research in the NFT finance domain. Through our interactions with the Furion project team, we gained a deep understanding of the homogenized fragment NFT Pool solution, and how it sparks new possibilities in the NFT market”, said Wilson, Investment Asian Lead at LBank Labs. Furion aligns seamlessly with Labs' distinct investing thesis, the ""Platform, Standard, Ecosystem"" proposition. This novel strategy breaks away from the conventional divisions in the blockchain industry, transcending the traditional views of technology-centric paradigms or sector-based categorizations. Furion's NFT platform, characterized by its point-to-pool mortgage lending model and token fragmentation, perfectly embodies the platform aspect of Labs' thesis. Additionally, Furion has the potential to become an industry standard, fulfilling the fundamental component of Labs' investment proposition. Finally, Furion's robust ecosystem of companies, developers, and engaged user communities exemplifies the ecosystem element that Labs seeks in its investments. On the ecosystem level, Furion has already established a healthy ecosystem, including associated companies, developers, and user communities. Furion actively engages with the global NFT community and promptly adjusts its products based on valuable feedback from the community. With its unique positioning in the NFT financialization space, Furion emerges as an ideal investment for Labs, aligning with their visionary investment approach and defying traditional categorizations within the blockchain industry. The venture fund also aims to strengthen its commitment by building a comprehensive network of Fund of Funds to enhance portfolio performance and diversification. LBank Labs operates in seven global regions, fostering collaboration and innovation across borders. About LBank LBank is one of the top crypto exchanges, established in 2015. It offers specialized financial derivatives, expert asset management services, and safe crypto trading to its users. The platform holds over 9 million users from more than 210 regions across the world.

First Animated Film Funded By DAO In a groundbreaking move highlighting the growing influence of decentralized finance and blockchain technology, Atrium, a leading Web3 creative studio, has released the pilot episode of its highly anticipated animated series, ""Nouns: A Movie."" What sets this project apart is that it was entirely funded by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), marking a significant milestone in the integration of blockchain and the entertainment industry. In March, the NounsDAO community approved a proposal to provide funding for the film. The approval was followed soon by a team of talented Atrium creatives, including William Yu, HKJay, Zen Doubt, 3DPrint Guy, and Meta Ent, coming together to write, produce, and animate the film. Notably, the entire movie production is being handled by a fully remote team, resulting in accelerated processes that would typically span several months and a much lower budget than required by traditional methods. First Episode Dropped The pilot episode of ""Nouns"" was made possible through a partnership between Atrium and Nouns DAO, a pioneering decentralized organization focused on promoting and supporting digital art initiatives. The collaboration aimed to explore new avenues for creativity and funding, leveraging the power of blockchain and the vibrant NFT ecosystem. The episode features characters from the Nouns NFT collection and introduces viewers to a captivating world where our young protagonist, Noun, along with his motley crew, embarks on an adventure to thwart malevolent forces. NounsDAO Partnered With Atrium Atrium, renowned for its expertise in the Web3 space, provided the technical infrastructure and creative vision necessary to bring the ""Nouns"" pilot episode to life. The studio's commitment to pushing the boundaries of digital art and storytelling has resonated strongly with the blockchain community. According to Supriyo Roy, the founder and CEO of Atrium, the open-source nature of the Nouns project provided the film's creators with complete freedom to develop a comprehensive world and storyline for the 8-bit characters without any constraints. ""There is no canon. Nouns are an infinite brand machine. There is no official top-down directive of how things should be done."" A New Funding Model In Entertainment The funding model behind the ""Nouns"" movie pilot episode demonstrates the disruptive potential of DAOs in the entertainment industry. The project has a total budget of $2.75 million, given in installments provided the team meets its goals. Through a combination of community voting and decentralized decision-making, the Nouns DAO allocates resources and determines the direction of the movie's production. As the Web3 ecosystem continues to evolve, it is clear that blockchain technology is reshaping the entertainment landscape. Through projects like ""Nouns,"" the potential of decentralized finance and blockchain in revolutionizing traditional industries becomes increasingly apparent, promising a future where creativity and innovation are more accessible and collaborative than ever before.

Mastercard Engage helps cut the time it takes to bring crypto cards to market and creates crypto-to-fiat conversion capabilities, Mastercard said. The system identifies and builds partnerships with companies that issue cards or are BIN [bank identification number] sponsors looking to launch a crypto card.  The initiative by the 57-year-old credit card firm with close to 30,000 staff worldwide is nicely timed with a recent push by traditional finance firms into the digital assets space and adds to its other efforts in the industry. Last month, the company announced a crypto credentials program to carry out anti-money laundering (AML) checks for cross-border transactions, using technology from Mastercard-owned blockchain analytics firm CipherTrace.  “The expanded Mastercard Engage network will help empower players across the digital asset ecosystem and beyond to fulfill their ambitions at scale, paired with the safety and security that comes with the Mastercard brand,” Raj Dhamodharan, executive vice president for blockchain and digital assets, said in a statement.  Mastercard also named a cohort of crypto payments firms joining the Engage program.

42420168,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUa20L,1687431440,Bitcoin's Price Bump to $30K Sees Short Traders Nurse Biggest Loss in 2 Months,"Short traders took on the biggest single-day losses since April as over $178 million worth of bets against crypto tokens were liquidated in the past 24 hours, CoinGlass data shows.  The total liquidations - including longs and shorts - exceeded $203 million, with bitcoin (BTC) futures racking up $75 million in losses followed by ether (ETH) futures at $51 million. Pepecoin (PEPE) futures saw the highest losses among altcoins at just under $10 million.  Shorts are bets against price rises, while longs refer to bets on price increases for any financial asset. Crypto exchange Binance recorded the most losses among its counterparts at $65 million, followed by OKX at $58 million.  Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).  Large liquidations can signal the local top or bottom of a steep price move – which may allow traders to position themselves accordingly.  Bitcoin touched the $30,000 level for the second time this year following a flurry of ETF filings in the U.S. – which may have buoyed a bullish outlook among traders. This likely fueled a rally among major tokens, with cardano's ADA, Solana’s SOL and dogecoin (DOGE) posting weekly gains of at least 18%.  Bitcoin’s sudden price bumps have also led to options traders betting on even higher prices, data suggests. Such sentiment is a near 180-turn from the start of June, when bullish hopes were dented following regulatory action in the U.S. against crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase.  Some market observers say the trend is likely to continue should ETF applications from traditional finance giants such as BlackRock be approved in the coming months.  “Bitcoin’s rally is part of a larger trend signaling a shift towards bitcoin as a distinctly strong and established store of value,” shared Alex Adelman, CEO of bitcoin rewards app Lolli, in an email. “Bitcoin’s recent climb to over 50% market dominance in the crypto markets reflects a growing demand for bitcoin among institutional and retail investors as a highly secure, decentralized holding that has proven its value over time.”  “The recent burst of bitcoin ETF applications from leading institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Invesco shows that new regulatory guidelines are the greenlight institutions have been waiting for to launch bitcoin-based products and meet client demand,” Adelman added.",POSITIVE,ADA | BTC,ADA | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/22/bitcoins-price-bump-to-30k-sees-short-traders-nurse-biggest-loss-in-2-months,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0c6c352c25195bb1e34cbeb07e4b84d5eb1bb2a6-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

14079567,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=539119,1687429303,When BlackRock Bitcoin ETF? Detailed Timeline And Implications,"BlackRock’s filing for a Bitcoin spot ETF (iShares Bitcoin Trust) has breathed new life into the market and sparked a strong rally. The hope is that BlackRock will trigger a “Great Accumulation Race” around Bitcoin, fuelled by the fact that 69% of all investors have been unwilling to sell their Bitcoins for over a year, Bitcoinist reported. Market experts give the BlackRock ETF a high chance of approval. Remarkably, BlackRock has an approval ratio of 575:1, but the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) ratio when it comes to rejecting Bitcoin spot ETFs is just as clear: 33:0. But because BlackRock has close ties to US regulators and Democratic politicians, there is room for an optimistic outlook on the likelihood of approval. As K33 Research writes in their latest market analysis, BlackRock is unlikely to spend time and resources if they do not see the chance of approval as very high. Race For The First Bitcoin Spot ETF Rumors have already emerged in recent days that BlackRock’s ETF filing could be decided within “days to weeks”, NewsBTC reported. But what are the exact deadlines? The SEC’s regulations provide a clue. The important thing to know here is that the deadlines for the SEC and its decision on the iShares Bitcoin Trust depend on when the application is published in the Federal Register for comments. Since this has not officially happened yet, there are only approximate estimates so far. Related Reading: “Yes, This Is A Bull Market” Expert Explains Why Bitcoin Will Outperform Tesla’s +162% Nevertheless, K33 Research has drawn up a rough timeline based on the SEC’s deadlines. Theoretically, a decision can be reached within four time intervals, with the decision process following a scheme of anchored decision dates. After publication of the application in the Federal Register, the SEC has 45 days in the first time interval to approve, reject or extend review of the ETF. Assuming the application is published in the Register on June 29, the SEC’s first deadline would be August 12, 2023. Similar inflection points occur 45 days later, 90 days later and 60 days later. When BlackRock #Bitcoin spot ETF? Timeline depends on the publication in the Federal Register. Assuming July 29: August 12: Extend 45 days September 26: Extend 90 days December 25: Extend 60 days Final deadline: February 23, 2024. h/t @K33Research More details 👇 — Jake Simmons (@realJakeSimmons) June 22, 2023 K33 Research states that the SEC must announce a decision after 240 days at the latest. This means that the market will have a decision by February 23, 2024 at the latest (may be shifted by a few days depending on the publication in the Federal Register). Will Grayscale Or CBOE Preempt BlackRock? Even though everyone is currently talking about BlackRock’s ETF filing, there is a possibility that two other institutions will get approval, or at least a decision on their matters, before the world’s largest asset manager. As K33 Research shows in its ETF schedule, the CBOE filed its “ARK 21Shares” before BlackRock and could potentially benefit from BlackRock’s momentum. Already on May 9, Cboe Global Markets filed to list and trade shares of a spot Bitcoin ETF from Cathie Woods Ark Invest and crypto investment product firm 21 on the Cboe BZX exchange. In addition, Grayscale could also receive a ruling ahead of BlackRock in its legal battle with the SEC. A final ruling on Grayscale’s lawsuit could be imminent. The final judgment is expected three to six months after the hearing. The hearing was held on March 7, 2023. The core of Grayscale’s lawsuit is that the SEC acted arbitrarily in approving futures-based ETFs and rejecting spot ETFs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hits $138,000 On Binance US, What Happened? As K33 Research discusses, all market participants are currently in a race for first mover advantage. The launch of ProShares BITO clearly demonstrated this advantage. BITO saw $1bn in inflows two days after launch. To date, BITO has a 93% market share among futures-based long BTC ETFs. However, whoever wins the race, it seems clear at the moment that Bitcoin investors will be the winners. Head of resaerch at CryptoQuant, Julio Moreno, recently shared the chart below and commented: “Here’s what happens when a big fund [Grayscale’s GBTC] increases Bitcoin demand.

Is this just the calm before the real storm? Bitcoin has work still to be done The tsunami called Bitcoin is building momentum and there is a real possibility that a breakthrough of the $30,000 resistance is on the cards. Many traders will have their short stops just above this level and therefore a short squeeze could be likely. Bitcoin really motored both Tuesday and Wednesday putting on as much as 14.6% in the process. Not a bad couple of day’s work. However, the main task is still to be accomplished, and this is facing the king of the cryptocurrencies like Everest, for a trepidatious climber. The reality of the situation So much bad press has hit the crypto market over the last few months that for the market to be going up is pretty miraculous. That is until you think of the fundamentals. On the one hand you have a pristine asset that is ridiculously scarce, more secure than any other asset, unreachable by government intervention, and able to be held, bought, and sent to anyone on the planet. On the other hand there is fiat currency, being printed to oblivion, in an unfair system, and being weaponised against the people. On top of this government agencies are doing their level best to stop citizens buying cryptocurrencies by bringing enforcement actions against all and sundry in the crypto sector. Banking is obsolete The banks that help to control the currency provide almost no interest to depositors, probably minus value when inflation is taken into account, and they control their customers by enforcing who they can send their currency to. Banking is utterly obsolete and it has taken the wildly innovative crypto sector to bust this banking facade wide open. These monoliths of antiquity are no longer fit for purpose. People can now hold their own value and wealth so there is no need for a middleman. Therefore the banks’ days are numbered. Bitcoin is for the people Bitcoin is likely to keep rising given its pure fundamentals, providing a store of value in the face of the rapidly diminishing purchasing power of fiat currencies like the dollar. The regulatory agencies might stop the majority of the institutions from getting onboard, but it needs to be remembered that Bitcoin is for the people. There is still time.

The funding round was led by Hashed, with participation from Superscrypt, Lambdaclass (Ergodic Fund), and Crypto.com. As rollups become more popular choices for many applications including defi due to its scalability, properly decentralising its operation and structuring economical design has become the next major point for rollup-centric ecosystem; Shared Sequencing Layer has arisen as the ultimate solution. Radius is dedicated to providing an economical and sustainable solution for Rollups, thereby protecting their users from harmful Miner Extractable Value (MEV). This is achieved through a groundbreaking zk scheme known as Practical Verifiable Delay Encryption (PVDE), developed by Radius. The shared sequencing layer with PVDE ensures that users are protected from harmful MEV in a truly trustless way, while still maximizing revenue for Rollups. ""Radius is committed to setting the standard for a trustless shared sequencing layer that not only maximizes revenue for Rollups but also safeguards users from the harmful effects of MEV,"" says AJ Ji Hoon Park. ""This funding will propel us forward in achieving our goals and redefining the boundaries of what is possible in the blockchain sphere."" Radius has also recently announced a partnership with Saga, the Rollup-as-a-Service, and has joined the Celestia Ecosystem. This partnership will drive further advancements in the rollup technology and enhance the security of the blockchain ecosystem. In addition to these achievements, Radius is in the process of building an MEV-Resistant Decentralized Exchange, known as 360. Enabled by Radius' shared sequencing layer, this new DEX is expected to significantly enhance the user experience and security in the DeFi space. Continuing its engagement with the broader blockchain community, Radius recently hosted a conference called ""Scaling 2023: The Renaissance"". The event featured renowned speakers from companies such as Starkware, Flashbots and Osmosis, further solidifying Radius' position as a thought pioneer in the industry. About Radius: Radius is a blockchain technology company pioneering a trustless shared sequencing layer that offers an economical and sustainable solution for Rollups and protects their users from harmful MEV. With its novel approach, Radius aims to revolutionize the Rollup space and contribute to the broader adoption of blockchain technology. Radius will launch an alpha version of its sequencing layer in Q1 of 2024.

The cryptocurrency's price jumped to $30,800 on Wednesday, the highest since April 14, cheering the recent flurry of spot bitcoin ETF applications by BlackRock (BLK), WisdomTree and Invesco (IVZ), which highlighted a sustained institutional appetite for the world's largest cryptocurrency.  The sudden change in the market trajectory from a week ago, when prices briefly traded below a crucial support at $25,200, has traders turning to options to chase the rally.  On Wednesday, bitcoin options contracts worth $3.3 billion changed hands across major exchanges, including Deribit. That's the highest single-day notional volume in three months. Deribit accounted for over 80% of the global tally.  ""We have seen the biggest trading volume in three months. There is a lot of interest in buying call options,"" Deribit's Asia business development personnel Lin Chen told CoinDesk.  Options give investors the right to buy or sell the underlying asset, in this case, bitcoin, at a set price at a later date. A call option buyer gets the right to buy and a put buyer gets the right to sell. Traders often buy calls as a low-cost leveraged bullish bet.  Call options at strike prices of $30,000, $31,000, $32,000 and $40,000 have been popular among traders in the past 24 hours, per Laevitas.  In the past seven days, call spreads have accounted for 45% of the total block flows. Block trades are large orders executed on over-the-counter liquidity networks like Paradigm and then listed on exchanges.  According to Patrick Chu, director of institutional sales and trading at Paradigm, the price rally has forced some call overwriters to buy back the bullish exposure. Call overwriting involves selling calls against the cryptocurrency owned and is a popular strategy for generating additional yield in a flat-to-negative market.  ""Mostly, people have been buying back the topside, especially option overwriters given the rapid upward move,"" Chu said.  DVOL spikes  The increased demand for options pushed Deribit's bitcoin volatility index, DVOL, to 59.24, the highest since early April, per Amberdata.  The DVOL measures bitcoin's 30-day implied volatility (IV) calculated using Deribit's options order book. The higher the demand for options, the higher the IV and vice versa. The IV refers to investors' expectations for price turbulence over a specific period.  ""The increased demand for options has pushed up the DVOL,"" Deribit's Chen said.  Implied volatility usually rises during risk aversion in traditional markets. Deribit's DVOL, however, tends to rise when prices rise, Chen explained.  Bitcoin's implied volatility and spot prices have been positively correlated since the start of the year.  ""The DVOL is moving reactively on the recent headlines and the last three days' spot move. Prices were very contained in the recent two months and realized volatility has been low overall. The market was caught a bit short [volatility] going in and people are scrambling to cover,"" Chu noted.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/22/bitcoin-options-volume-jumps-to-33b-as-price-rallies-to-two-month-high,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6e2ee8ff5132bdbcb5b02b68319bbe342b416156-1572x898.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This obstacle had proven to be a significant challenge for AVAX bulls in the previous weeks, hindering their upward momentum. However, drawing inspiration from Bitcoin’s impressive surge past the $30,000 mark, AVAX followed suit and decisively shattered this barrier. This remarkable achievement injected renewed optimism into the AVAX community and set the stage for potential further gains. As the cryptocurrency world buzzes with anticipation, one cannot help but wonder: Will Avalanche’s AVAX continue its upward trajectory, surpassing even loftier milestones? Indicators Suggest Potential Resistance For AVAX AVAX registered a notable 6.3% surge within a 24-hour period, propelling its price to $13.19 according to CoinGecko. AVAX price all glowing in green today. Source: Coingecko Additionally, the crypto exhibited an impressive 16% surge over the past seven days, signaling growing momentum. However, despite these positive developments, AVAX still faces potential hurdles in its upward trajectory. According to the latest AVAX price report, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a widely used indicator that tracks the balance between buying and selling pressure, has consistently remained below the 50-mark since April. AVAX market cap currently at $4.5 billion. Chart: TradingView.com This suggests that selling pressure has dominated the market during this period. While Avalanche managed to overcome the earlier roadblock, the lingering presence of the RSI below 50 may indicate the potential for resistance as bullish trends encounter selling pressure.

The recovery in OBV indicates an improvement in demand for AVAX, which is a positive sign for its future performance. However, it is important to note that as the RSI approaches the 50-mark, it may act as a crucial resistance level for AVAX bulls. The RSI’s proximity to this threshold suggests that a significant increase in buying pressure will be necessary to overcome potential selling pressure and sustain AVAX’s upward momentum. Bitcoin’s Resilience And Its Influence On The Altcoin Market While Avalanche’s AVAX has been making noteworthy strides, the broader cryptocurrency market has been closely watching Bitcoin’s performance as it defies expectations and regulatory pressures. Bitcoin has displayed remarkable resilience in the face of ongoing regulatory challenges and has continued to captivate investors with its surprising rally. Source: Coingecko Bitcoin’s performance often sets the tone for the overall market sentiment. When Bitcoin experiences significant price movements, it tends to impact the value of altcoins, including AVAX. Positive movements in Bitcoin often lead to increased investor confidence, which in turn fuels the demand for altcoins.

Coinbase Custody is a service offered by the crypto exchange that allows institutional investors to store large amounts of tokens, such as bitcoin, in a secure wallet. It will serve as the custodian for bitcoin held on BlackRock Bitcoin ETF, if the request is approved by regulators.  A wallet tracked by CryptoQuant shows the bitcoin sent to the custodial wallet came from Coinbase (COIN). A custodial wallet is different from a cold or hot wallet that Coinbase uses to store customers’ holdings, suggesting a large player probably bought the bitcoin on Coinbase and sent the holdings to the custodian wallet, as transaction data shows.  The wallet previously held over 5,000 bitcoin that were deposited between May 19 and May 20, the data show.  CryptoQuant analyst Bradley Park said in a Telegram message that BlackRock’s ETF filing may have spurred positive sentiment among bitcoin holders and investors, which could explain the transaction.  “The BlackRock effect has positively affected market sentiment and even institutions' bitcoin buying,” Park said.  Trading volumes on Coinbase have nearly doubled in the past week as bitcoin prices rose 20%. CoinGecko data shows over $2 billion worth of tokens were traded on the exchange in the past 24 hours, double the daily average of $1 billion since the start of June.  Bitcoin trading pairs against the U.S. dollar and tether (USDT) accounted for $900 million of these volumes suggesting demand among traders as the asset broke the $30,000 mark on Thursday.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/22/bitcoin-holdings-in-one-coinbase-custody-wallet-jumped-by-25k-after-blackrock-etf-filing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dc6d74a9fefbcd50b538fefb5079d1f6c6230a5e-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
14077595,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/starknet-closer-to-full-evm-compatibility-with-kakarot-testnet,1687424100,Starknet Closer To Full EVM Compatibility With Kakarot Testnet,"Zero-knowledge layer-2 scaling solution Starknet has moved closer to full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility with the upcoming August launch of Kakarot, a new testnet. Kakarot’s team has also announced that it has received backing from Ledger co-founder Nicolas Bacca, Starkware, and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Getting Closer To EVM Compatibility Kakarot CEO and co-founder Elias Tazartes stated that Starknet while being a leading zero knowledge rollup in the Ethereum ecosystem, lacks Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility. As a result, there is a significant barrier to entry. Starknet has gained popularity among developers to help scale decentralized applications, transactions, and computations on Ethereum using its native language, Cairo. According to developers on Starknet, Cairo makes it easier and faster to develop, review, and maintain new code. However, Starknet’s lack of Ethereum compatibility could deter some developers. “The greatest impact that Kakarot can have is to make Starknet EVM compatible. Kakarot right now is like a Solidity or any language engine. Eventually, you will be able to put that engine within Starknet to make it EVM compatible.” Tazartes revealed that the idea for the zkEVM was first mooted during a Starkware conference held in July 2022. By October, the team was able to get together for a week and begin working on the new zkEVM. By December, coding for the project was complete, and the team was ready to create a fully functional execution layer. Tazartes also revealed that Buterin invested in Kakarot thanks to his enthusiasm for a multiple-zkEVM approach to build out the Ethereum ecosystem. “For Vitalik, the more zkEVMs, the better, because as long as you have a wide diversity of architecture and diversity of approaches…then this is really good for the space as a whole.” Custom Virtual Machine Currently, Starknet runs its own custom smart contract Virtual Machine called the Cairo VM, which is able to leverage Cairo. This means that Starknet does not come with direct EVM compatibility out of the box, which could prove to be a significant hurdle moving forward. According to Tazartes, “Some teams really need to be able to use Solidity. For example, if someone wrote a DEX or an AMM for the Ethereum ecosystem and now has 60,000 lines of code already audited, ready to go, but it’s only on EVM chains.” If developers wanted to use Starknet, they would need to hire a new dev team, write and audit the code, and maintain the two code bases. Tazartes described this as “prohibitively expensive.” Kakarot zkEVM Secures Backing The Kakarot zkEVM team also announced on the 2nd of June that it had closed its pre-seed funding round. Investors in the seed round include Ledger co-founder and VP of innovation Nicolas Bacca, blockchain scaling firm Starkware, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, and several others. Kakarot uses STARK proofs for provable transactions and blocks, ensuring security and transparency. Through these validity proofs, Kakarot is able to leverage Ethereum’s security while also offering low costs. Project Roadmap The project roadmap states that in the first phase, Kakarot will be an EVM on the Starknet Layer 2, helping open the door to a range of possibilities, and facilitate the expansion of the Starknet ecosystem. In the subsequent phase, Kakarot and Starknet’s Madara sequencer will be combined into a unified stack. This will enable Layer 3 zkEVMs. According to the team, integrating Madara and Kakarot will help the teams deploy zkEVM app chains and settle transactions on Starknet using validity proofs. “As a result of computing on another layer, gas costs are (asymptotically) exponentially lower than on L2, and performance (TPS) is higher. The scalability of rollups stacks and multiplies.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Visit Wildcoins Casino → Using Litecoin for Online Gambling Litecoin, as an alternative cryptocurrency, offers a unique opportunity for online gambling. It operates on an open-source global payment network that is not controlled by any central authority, making it a decentralized digital currency. Playing at Litecoin casinos when online gambling involves a process similar to using traditional currencies, but with the added benefits of speed, security, and anonymity that cryptocurrencies offer. To use Litecoin for online gambling, you first need to purchase Litecoin on a cryptocurrency exchange. Once you have Litecoin in your digital wallet, you can deposit it into your online casino account, much like you would with traditional currency. When you’re ready to cash out your winnings, you can withdraw them back into your Litecoin wallet. What Makes Litecoin Gambling Sites Better? Instant Payments with Litecoin One of the key features of the best Litecoin casino websites is the ability to make instant payments. Traditional banking methods can take days to process transactions, but Litecoin transactions are almost instantaneous. Even when comparing different crypto gambling sites, Litecoin casinos are the better choice. Because LTC has a faster block generation rate than Bitcoin, this allows for quicker transaction confirmation. In the end, this means you can deposit and withdraw funds quickly, allowing you to start playing or cash out your winnings without delay. Secure Online Gambling Sites The best Litecoin casinos offer enhanced security features that make it a safe option for online gambling. It uses a proof-of-work algorithm called Scrypt, which is less resource-intensive than the SHA-256 algorithm used by Bitcoin. This makes it more secure against hardware brute-force attacks. Furthermore, all transactions are recorded on a public ledger, the blockchain, making it nearly impossible to tamper with or forge transactions. Lower Fees Another advantage of playing at Litecoin casinos is the lower transaction fees. Traditional online casinos often charge high fees for deposits and withdrawals. However, because Litecoin casino transactions do not involve banks or other financial institutions, the fees are typically much lower. This makes it a more cost-effective option than real money online gambling. Enhanced Privacy at Litecoin Casinos LTC transactions do not require personal information, which allows you to maintain your privacy when litecoin gambling online. This is a significant advantage for players who prefer to keep their gambling activities private. A Beginner’s Guide to Litecoin at Online Casinos The Process of Buying Litecoin Before you can start gambling at a Litecoin casino, you need to purchase some LTC. This can be done on various cryptocurrency exchanges using traditional currency or other cryptocurrencies. The process is similar to buying stocks or other assets. You will need to create an account on the exchange, deposit funds, and then purchase Litecoin. Recommended Wallets for Storing Cryptocurrencies Once you have purchased Litecoin, you will need a digital wallet to store it. There are several types of wallets available, including hardware wallets, software wallets, and online wallets. Hardware wallets are physical devices that store your cryptocurrency offline, providing the highest level of security. Software wallets are programs that you install on your computer or smartphone, while online wallets are web-based services that store your cryptocurrency on the cloud. Protect Your Litecoin Investments It’s important to take steps to protect your crypto funds, this includes using secure wallets, updating your wallet software, and keeping your private keys safe. Private keys are a crucial security feature of cryptocurrencies, as they are required to access your funds. If your private keys are lost or stolen, you will lose access to your funds. Deposit and Withdrawals at Litecoin Casinos Once you have LTC in your wallet, you can deposit it into your online casino account. The process is similar to making a deposit with traditional currency. Go to the deposit section of the casino, select Litecoin as your payment method, and enter the amount you want to deposit. The casino will provide a Litecoin address for you to send your funds to. Once the transaction is confirmed, the funds will be available in your casino account. Cash Out Your Winnings in Three Easy Steps Go to the withdrawal section of the casino, select Litecoin as your withdrawal method, and enter the amount you want to withdraw. Provide your Litecoin wallet address for the casino to send your winnings. Once the transaction is confirmed, the funds will appear in your Litecoin wallet. Best Casino Games for Litecoin The best Litecoin casino platforms offer a wide range of games, including slots, poker, blackjack, roulette, and more. Some also offer live dealer games, which provide a more immersive gambling experience. The availability of games can vary between casinos, so it’s important to check what games are available before depositing funds. Here are some of the most popular casino games: Litecoin Slots Slot machines are a staple in any casino. At Litecoin & Bitcoin Slots, players can bet LTC on each spin. The gameplay is straightforward: players spin the reels and hope to land on a winning combination of symbols. The winning conditions vary based on the specific slot machine, but generally, players win when they land certain combinations of symbols on the paylines. Live Dealer Roulette Roulette is a game of chance where players bet on where a ball will land on a spinning wheel. In Litecoin Roulette, players place their bets using Litecoin. The gameplay and winning conditions are the same as traditional roulette, with players winning based on where the ball lands in relation to their bets. Crypto Crash Games Crash gambling casino games are quickly gaining popularity at Litecoin casinos. Players bet a certain amount of LTC and watch as a multiplier increases from 1x upwards. The multiplier can crash at any random time, and the goal is to cash out before it does. If the player cashes out before the multiplier crashes, they win their bet multiplied by the number at which they cashed out. If the multiplier crashes before they cash out, they lose their bet. Dice Dice is a simple yet popular Litecoin casino game. Players bet LTC and predict whether the roll of a dice will result in a number higher or lower than a predetermined number. If the player’s prediction is correct, they win, with the payout based on the probability of their bet. Moon Moon is a crypto-specific game similar to Crash casino games. Players bet LTC and watch as a spaceship takes off, with the multiplier increasing the further it goes. The spaceship can crash at any time, and the goal is to cash out before it does. The winning conditions are the same as any Crash game. LTC Sports Betting Sports betting with LTC is an exciting, safe, and innovative way to engage with your favorite sports events. The best Litecoin casinos have a sportsbook, allowing users to place bets on a wide range of sports, from football and basketball to horse racing and esports. Just like other crypto sports betting, you can bet on outcomes, scores, player performances, and more. Crypto Bonuses in Litecoin All of the best Litecoin casinos offer promotions to attract and retain players. These can include welcome bonuses, deposit bonuses, free spins, and more. It’s important to read the terms and conditions of these promotions carefully, as they often have wagering requirements that must be met before you can cash out your winnings. Popular Bonus Types Here are some of the most popular bonuses that players can take advantage of at Litecoin casinos: Welcome Bonus This is the most common type of bonus offered by all the best Litecoin casinos. It is typically offered to new players as a way to encourage them to sign up and start playing. The welcome bonus usually matches a certain percentage of the player’s initial deposit. For instance, a casino might offer a 100% match bonus up to a certain amount of Litecoin. It’s also common to receive free spins as part of the welcome bonus package. No Deposit Bonuses This bonus is particularly attractive to new players because it doesn’t require them to deposit any LTC to claim it. Instead, the online casino gives the player a small amount of funds to start playing with. This allows players to try out casino games without risking their own money. Free Spins Many Litecoin casinos offer free spins as part of their bonus promotions. Usually, the free spins can be used on specific slots and give players the chance to win without having to wager any of their own funds. Reload Bonus This bonus is offered to existing players who make additional deposits. It’s a way for the litecoin casino to reward loyal players and encourage them to keep playing. Like the welcome bonus, it usually matches a certain percentage of the player’s deposit. Cashback Some Litecoin casinos offer a cashback bonus, which returns a percentage of the player’s losses over a certain period. This can help mitigate losses and give players some extra motivation to keep playing. VIP and Loyalty Programs Almost all Litecoin casinos have a VIP or loyalty program that rewards players based on their activity at the casino. These programs often offer a variety of bonuses, including exclusive free spins, higher deposit limits, and even personal account managers. Wagering Requirements and Terms Wagering requirements are the number of times you must bet your bonus money or free spins before you can withdraw winnings. These requirements can vary widely between Litecoin casinos, so it’s important to read the terms and conditions carefully. Other terms to look out for include game restrictions, time limits, maximum bet limits, and that it isn’t limited to one crypto like a Bitcoin casino bonus. Safety and Security in Litecoin Casinos While the best Litecoin casinos offer many benefits, it’s important to ensure that the casino you choose is safe and secure. This includes checking that the casino is licensed and regulated, uses secure encryption technology, and has a good reputation. Choose A Licensed Litecoin Casino Choosing trusted and licensed Litecoin casinos is crucial to ensure a safe and fair gambling experience. Check that the online casinos are licensed by highly regarded regulatory bodies and have positive reviews from other players. Secure Transactions When playing at a Litecoin casino, it is important to follow best practices for secure transactions. This includes using a secure wallet, keeping your private keys safe, and only gamble on trusted and licensed ltc casinos. Protecting The Crypto Wallet Protecting your wallet is the most important step to safeguard your LTC funds. This includes using a secure wallet, regularly updating your wallet software, and keeping your private keys safe. Conclusion Choosing the best Litecoin casinos offer many benefits, including speed, security, lower fees, and anonymity. However, it’s important to do your research and choose a trusted and licensed casino. By choosing our recommended LTC casinos in this article and following the steps outlined in this guide, you can enjoy a safe and enjoyable online gambling experience.

A Litecoin Casino is an online gambling platform that accepts LTC as a form of payment. The best litecoin casinos offer a variety of games such as slots, poker, roulette, and crypto-specific games. They operate similarly to traditional online casinos but offer the added benefits of faster transactions and lower fees associated with cryptocurrencies. What is a Welcome Bonus at LTC Casinos? A Welcome Bonus is a promotional offer provided by many Litecoin Casinos to attract new players. It typically involves deposit bonuses with a certain percentage of bonus funds. The bonus funds can be used to play litecoin casino games on the platform but usually come with wagering requirements that must be met before they can be withdrawn. Can I get Free Spins at Litecoin Casinos? Free spins are common promotional offers at LTC Casinos. The Free spins may be offered as part of a welcome bonus, a standalone promotion, or as a reward within casino games. Any winnings from free spins may be subject to wagering requirements. Can I withdraw my Welcome Bonus in LTC? Yes, you can withdraw your welcome bonus in LTC, but usually, you must first meet the casino’s wagering requirements. These requirements stipulate that you must wager the bonus amount a certain number of times before it can be withdrawn. Just like online casino real money websites the specific requirements vary by casino, so it’s important to read the terms and conditions. Are Litecoin Casinos safe to play? The safety of a Litecoin gambling site depends on several factors, including its licensing, regulation, and security measures. The best Litecoin Casino brands are licensed by a recognized gambling authority, use secure encryption technology to protect player data, and offer provably fair games that are regularly audited by independent bodies. Responsible Gambling Litecoin gambling should always be a form of entertainment, never a means of financial gain. This is especially true when it comes to gambling at Litecoin casinos. As a responsible gambler, you must be aware of the risks involved and take necessary precautions to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience. Firstly, it’s important to note that you must be at least 18 years old to participate in any form of gambling, including at a Litecoin casino. This age restriction is in place to protect young individuals from the potential negative impacts of gambling sites. When gambling at LTC casinos, or any other site, it’s crucial to only play with what you can afford to lose. Cryptos are highly volatile, and their value can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time. This can add an extra layer of risk to your gambling activities at online casinos. Here are some essential tips to ensure responsible gambling: Set a Budget: Decide on a specific amount of LTC that you are willing to risk. Once this limit is reached, stop playing. Time Management: Limit the amount of time you spend at the litecoin casino. It can be easy to lose track of time when you’re engrossed in a game, so setting a timer or alarm can be helpful. Understand the Casino Games: Before you start betting, make sure you fully understand the rules of the game you’re playing. This includes the odds of winning and the potential payouts. Avoid Chasing Losses: If you find yourself on a losing streak, it can be tempting to keep playing in an attempt to win back what you’ve lost. However, this can lead to even greater losses. Seek Help if Needed: If you feel that your online gambling habits are becoming problematic, don’t hesitate to seek help. There are numerous resources available, including counseling services and online support groups. Remember, the goal of gambling should be to have fun. If it’s causing you stress or financial hardship, it’s time to step back and reassess.

42420159,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUa1t7,1687422813,Crédit Agricole’s CACEIS Gains Crypto Custody Registration in France,"CACEIS, the asset servicing arm of banking giants Crédit Agricole and Santander, has been registered by French regulators to provide crypto custody services.  CACEIS Bank, which provides services to asset managers such as insurers, pension funds and private equity, was registered by France’s Financial Markets Authority (AMF) as of Tuesday June 20, according to the regulator’s website.  It joins other traditional finance firms such as Societe Generale's Forge and AXA Investment Managers in being recognized under one of the most advanced crypto regulatory frameworks in Europe, as the European Union prepares to impose new crypto licensing rules known as MiCA as of 2024.  CACEIS, which has 4.6 trillion euros ($5.1 trillion) of assets under custody, has been rumored to be seeking the crypto regulatory status since 2021.  Registration with the AMF is compulsory for those providing crypto custody, exchange or trading services in France. Binance, the world's biggest crypto exchange, is currently under investigation by the French authorities for allegedly illegally providing services before it received approval in 2022.  The move is the latest in a series of traditional finance companies to show an interest in moving into the crypto space. Earlier this week, Deutsche Bank revealed it was seeking a crypto custody license in Germany, and the world's largest asset manager BlackRock last week filed to operate an exchange-traded fund linked to the price of bitcoin (BTC).  The European Central Bank has asked banks to hold high levels of precautionary capital for holdings it deems as risky, though a survey published by the regulator in February said crypto activities and exposures were “insignificant.”  Crédit Agricole did not immediately respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment.

Shibarium is a planned layer 2 blockchain focused on metaverse and non-fungible token (NFT) applications that will use shiba inu (SHIB), bone (BONE) and leash (LEASE) tokens to operate. The blockchain is expected to go live later this year, the developers say.  In a Thursday update, lead developer Shytoshi Kusama shared that the so-termed “Shibacals: Authenticated Collectibles” will employ NFC chips to digitally authenticate physical items – which could boost the value of these collectibles. Near Field Communication allows devices to interact wirelessly over a very short distance.  For example, Shibacals can be used to generate a tag for a real-world product, such as a T-shirt, which is tied to a user’s NFT collection in a way that authenticates the owner of the T-shirt and the NFT as the same person. On resale, these tags can be verified on the blockchain so buyers can differentiate between original products and copies.  “The NFT craze is, in part, due to the verifiable ownership and scarcity that digital items on the blockchain offer,” Kusama explained in the update. “But, what about physical objects? As mass adoption unfolds (preferably on Shibarium), and scammers move from wallets to tangible items, how will we authenticate these items?”  Shibacals tags will not be limited to the Shibarium ecosystem and could be used to verify products on any blockchain, according to the article.  Shiba Inu ecosystem tokens jumped on Wednesday following the update.

14076175,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/struct-finance-launches-customizable-interest-rate-solution,1687420800,Struct Finance Launches Customizable Interest Rate Solution,"Struct Finance, an innovative decentralized finance (DeFi) platform facilitating the trading of structured financial instruments, has unveiled its flagship product. Struct has released a customizable interest rate vault that features a groundbreaking “tranching” mechanism. According to an official statement, Struct Finance will incorporate various tokens, tokenized derivatives, vaults, and pools to create customized interest rate products that align with users’ risk preference. The newly launched interest rate products will empower individuals to divide and repackage the risk associated with any yield-bearing DeFi assets into distinct segments. This is undertaken in a process known as tranching. These products consist of a single vault that is split into two tranches, each offering different returns. Choose Your Interest The first tranche Struct has pioneered caters to conservative investors seeking consistent fixed returns, while the second tranche suits those with a higher risk appetite and provides variable returns. The yield generated by the underlying asset is directed to the fixed tranche, ensuring predictable returns. The remaining yield is allocated to the variable tranche, providing it with amplified exposure to the yield-bearing asset. “The lack of fixed-yield returns in crypto has been a deterrent to entry of both larger institutions and smaller players with more conservative risk appetites,” stated Struct. “Considering the Struct Factory allows permissionless tranching of liquidity pools, fixed rate returns may become commonplace enough to tame the wild and volatile returns of web3.” More Structured Products in the Works The tranching mechanism developed by Struct is merely the first in a series of planned products, designed to provide DeFi users with diversified investment opportunities. At the core of these products is the series of interest rate vaults that will power the Struct Finance ecosystem as it develops. Built on top of GMX (GLP), Struct’s vaults tranche an underlying yield-bearing asset into two, creating a product that generates fixed yield, and another with enhanced exposure to the performance of the underlying asset. Currently live on Avalanche’s layer1 network, Struct’s future plans include the release of a native token and the development of additional structured financial products.

14075975,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=539078,1687420248,"Shiba Inu: This New AI Meme Token Partnered With Shibarium, Surges 81%","Shiba Inu lead developer Shytoshi Kusama recently published a new blog post about the latest developments in the SHIB ecosystem. However, while the focus of Kusama’s blog post was on Shibacals, there was a more hidden news: Shibarium’s partnership with AI meme token project Bad Idea.AI. The project’s official Twitter account also drew attention to the news, confirming that the partnership is now official. An image within the blog post showed an overview of all official partners and tokens that belong to the Shibarium ecosystem. Among them is Bad Idea.AI. It’s official @badideaai & #Shibarium partnership pic.twitter.com/pUQMT2FkdA — Bad Idea Ai (@badideaai) June 21, 2023 Kusama has already spoken out in the AI meme token project’s Telegram group, expressing his delight that artificial intelligence (AI) will help decentralize Shibarium. He wrote: Thanks to this BAD community that has given us great insight about AI for our upcoming projects. Alongside our other partners like Unification, (and some projects I believe will bring massive value to Shibarium) we now have a powerful toolset, and plan that includes AI, for decentralization. I can’t thank you enough. #hailshib that’s one thing that was never a bad idea. Remarkably, Bad Idea.AI’s tool already caused a stir within the SHIB community in the past few days, but at that time it was not yet clear that it would become an official partner of Shiba Inu.

We bought this as a joke and love it and look forward to seeing how we implement it in the future.

To answer this question, the team has launched BAD IDEA, an “experiment” that combines AI, blockchain and DAOs in “a risky, meme-worthy concoction”, “think of it as humanity’s Hail Mary pass, a last-ditch effort to secure our future in a world where artificial intelligence threatens to call the shots.” Related Reading: US Politician Cheers Shiba Inu Price Surge, But Trend Reversal Still Pending The BAD token is currently only available on Uniswap V2 and has a total supply of 831 trillion BAD tokens. 59% are currently public, the rest is being held back for development, marketing and a “Humanity’s Last Hope Fund”. Also, there is a team allocation of 4.2%. At press time, BAD was ranked #2772 on CoinMarketcap and had a market cap of around $10 million. In the last 24 hours, its trading volume was $1.4 million, up 702%. With a price of $0.00000001134, BAD has seen an increase of 81% in the last 24 hours. The Shiba Inu price is currently facing key resistance at $0.00000837, where the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level resides. As outlined in the last price analysis, the first scenario has come true.

Lin has filed a lawsuit in the High Court of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. According to the lawsuit, the exchange continued to use the Huobi trademark without obtaining consent from Li Lin’s company, X-Spot. Huobi Founder Sues Exchange He Founded Chinese crypto reporter posted details about the lawsuit on his Twitter handle, stating that the crypto firm had resumed using the “Huobi” trademark without permission from X-Spot. Lin’s company maintains exclusive rights to the trademark. The news of the lawsuit comes as the exchange attempts to increase its footprint in Hong Kong in the face of growing regulatory pressure on the crypto industry. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission has also clamped down on cryptocurrencies and crypto platforms, forcing exchanges to look for more friendly jurisdictions. Colin Wu, a Chinese crypto reporter, published details about the lawsuit on Twitter, stating, “Huobi founder Li Lin formally sued Huobi Global in Hong Kong for using its Chinese trademark 火币 that was not allowed to continue to be used in the original acquisition contract. Huobi was acquired by Justin Sun for over $1 billion last year. Sun froze Li Lin’s brother’s account and accused him of dumping HT this year.” Li vs Sun The move to sue the exchange comes after Justin Sun, Huobi Global Advisor, moved to block Li Lin’s brother, Li Wei’s account and accused him of dumping Huobi Global’s native HT token. Sun had assured token holders at the time that the volume of HT tokens sold by Wei would be removed from the circulating supply, restoring the token’s original value. The move resulted in the token facing significant volatility. Following the blocking of the account, Huobi began using the “Huobi” trademark once again. However, the complaint filed by Li Lin on the 21st of June, 2023, states that X-Spot had retained exclusive rights to the Huobi trademark. “X-Spot Limited has retained exclusive rights to the ‘Huobi’ trademark, which Huobi Global Limited has been using without X-Spot’s authorization.”’ Apparently, when the original shareholders transferred their shares in Huobi Global to About Capital Management, they explicitly agreed to retain the “Huobi” trademark. According to the terms of the agreement, About Capital’s buyout vehicle would control a majority stake in Huobi Global once the transaction was complete. The sale of the exchange was part of a larger strategy to position the platform as an option for providing international investors with the best investment and trading services. Apart from retaining trademark rights, shareholders also agreed that the rights would not be transferred to Huobi or the buyer. They added that the parties’ asset delivery and equity transfer agreement prohibited the purchaser from using the “Huobi” brand and trademark. Huobi Global Counters However, Huobi Global has countered the claims, arguing that the exchange maintains the right to use the trademark in a number of legal jurisdictions globally. According to the exchange’s interpretation of the agreement, it has the mandate to use the “Huobi” trademark freely. Huobi Global Limited is currently looking to expand its operations in Hong Kong. However, the exchange is not yet registered in the region. This is significant due to the threat posed to the proposed expansion plans by Li Lin’s lawsuit. According to operational rules in Hong Kong and other regions, the right to use a trademark is subject to the regulations and laws in the region. As a result, a court will have to approve Huobi’s expansion plans. Meanwhile, the Huobi token is currently trading at $2.69, suggesting increased investor interest in the token despite the ongoing troubles. So far, there has been no official comment by Justin Sun or Huobi Global about the lawsuit. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

14074797,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/valkyrie-files-for-bitcoin-btc-spot-etf,1687417200,Valkyrie Files for Bitcoin $BTC Spot ETF,"Crypto fund manager Valkyrie has joined a growing group of financial entities seeking to create Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs).The firm submitted an S-1 registration form to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on June 21, expressing its intent to create a Bitcoin spot ETF. The proposed fund, if approved, would be added on the Nasdaq list under the ticker symbol $BRRR. Valkyrie already has an established track record with Bitcoin (BTC) futures ETFs. It launched the Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF), the second BTC futures ETF in the U.S, in October 2021. The Valkyrie Balance Sheet Opportunities (VBB) was launched in December of the same year, though it was liquidated in October 2022. Currently, Valkyrie also operates the Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI), which is designed to track the performance of companies that generate revenue or profits from BTC mining. Valkyrie Among a Wave of Bitcoin Spot ETF Filings The move by Valkyrie is indicative of a broader trend within the financial sector, with several entities recently filing applications for Bitcoin spot ETFs. Notably, BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, filed to list a BTC spot ETF on the Nasdaq as a trust on June 15. Additionally, New York-based asset management fund WisdomTree and global fund manager Invesco lodged their applications for a similar product on June 20. There are also rumors of Fidelity preparing to file an application for a BTC spot ETF, although these reports remain unconfirmed. Valkyrie's decision to file for a Bitcoin spot ETF may have been catalyzed by the actions of these other financial firms. Valkyrie Investments' chief investment officer, Steven McClurg, had previously stated in a podcast earlier in March that he believed a BTC ETF would only become feasible ""in a future administration after the next elections or through legislative action."" The rise in Bitcoin spot ETF filings comes as Bitcoin's value exhibits significant growth, registering a 6.41% increase at the time of the report. The flurry of recent filings points to a heightened interest in providing investors with exposure to Bitcoin without the need to hold the cryptocurrency directly. The Implications of Bitcoin Spot ETFs A Bitcoin spot ETF is a fund that intends to track the value of Bitcoin itself, rather than Bitcoin futures contracts. This form of ETF would purchase Bitcoin directly, allowing investors to gain exposure to the asset without needing to buy, store, or manage the cryptocurrency themselves. Bitcoin spot ETFs have been a topic of keen interest and ongoing debate within the financial sector for several years. While the idea has attracted considerable attention, approvals from regulatory bodies have been slow to come, primarily due to concerns about market volatility, the potential for manipulation, and regulatory oversight of the underlying Bitcoin market. Valkyrie's filing, along with those from other financial powerhouses, signals a growing optimism that these concerns can be overcome and that the SEC may be ready to approve the launch of a Bitcoin spot ETF. The move by these firms to apply for spot Bitcoin ETFs could represent a significant shift in the cryptocurrency investment landscape. While Valkyrie has a history with Bitcoin futures ETFs, their new application reflects an effort to provide investors with more direct exposure to Bitcoin. This comes amidst a broader trend in the financial sector of blending traditional investment mechanisms with the emerging world of cryptocurrencies. These developments underscore the growing acceptance of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies within mainstream finance. Precisely in this same sense, the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs could open the floodgates for similar products, paving the way for increased institutional investment in cryptocurrencies. It is important to note, however, that while the trend of filings is optimistic, it doesn't guarantee approval from regulatory bodies. This current perceived rush for Bitcoin spot ETFs illustrates an emerging shift in the traditional finance sector towards embracing digital assets. This comes as Bitcoin continues to gain in value, highlighting the potential for such ETFs to become a key tool for investors seeking exposure to the digital asset without the associated risks of direct ownership.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $30,140, up nearly 5% over the past 24 hours. BTC last cracked the $30,000 threshold in April.  Bitcoin began rising Tuesday after the long, U.S. Juneteenth holiday weekend as markets more fully digested the impact of the BlackRock filing. Later in the day, spot bitcoin re-filings by Invesco and WisdomTree brightened the mood further, offering the latest evidence of institutional investors' growing interest in the crypto space even as markets have struggled amid an uncertain regulatory environment, pesky inflation and other macroeconomic woes.  Read More: Invesco Reapplies for Bitcoin ETF, Advocates for More Crypto Investment Products  “There is a wave of optimism in the crypto market now that big institutional players are working to take part in the industry in a big way,"" Nihar Neelakanti, the CEO and co-founder of carbon-backed digital collectibles Ecosapiens, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  Neelakanti also also noted ""rumors"" that Fidelity might also apply for an ETF. On Tuesday, a Fidelity spokesperson told CoinDesk that the firm had not publicly announced any plans to file. Invesco, which has $1.4 trillion in assets under management, filed its application in conjunction with digital asset manager Galaxy Digital. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rejected WisdomTree's first spot bitcoin ETF application in 2022.  ""These players, among other big names, are obviously going to add a lot of liquidity to the market and make investors more confident to buy bitcoin again,"" Neelakanti wrote. ""And big institutions partnering with crypto are going to continue to be a catalyst for bitcoin for the foreseeable future, even as the U.S. regulatory situation continues to cause some hardship for the industry.""  Ether enjoyed a similarly upbeat Wednesday to continue its momentum. The second largest crypto in market value was recently changing hands above $1,900 for the first time in three weeks, up more than 6% from Tuesday, same time. Other large cryptos spent the day in deep green territory with ADA and MATIC, the native cryptos of smart contract platforms Cardano and Polygon, each up more than 7%, along with popular memecoin DOGE. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets performance, was recently up more than 5%.  U.S. stocks veered from their weeks-long winning ways to tick down with tech stocks leading the decline. The technology heavy Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500, closed off 1.2% and 0.5%, respectively. Asia markets opened on a sour note with the Hang Seng and Shanghai indexes recently falling about 2% and 1.3%, respectively  Ecosapiens' Neelakanti believes that TradFi will take advantage of ""regulatory pressure on crypto"" to unveil new digital asset initiatives, although he is uncertain of these partnerships long-term benefit. He added, however that every crypto ""wave"" has drawn new participants.  ""The last wave was a lot of retail speculators, and this fits a pattern of how new asset classes develop over time,"" he wrote. ""You have early believers, then more retail people, and then the third wave of more institutions getting into the fold. We’re starting to see the beginnings of the third wave now.

Insights  Crypto's ""Crisis of Confidence"" and the Rush of Spot Bitcoin ETF Filings  Cryptos have been ""going through a crisis of confidence,"" yet the past week's ""rush of filings for spot bitcoin ETFs has returned ""some excitement"" into the markets, especially into ""well-known,"" quality coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum,"" Callie Cox, U.S. investment analyst for social investing platform eToro, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program on Wednesday.  ""Institutional lenders, where this industry grows, whether you like it or not, that's the history for many emerging markets,"" Cox said. ""And the fact that some of the largest issuers in the world are stepping in and saying, 'we want to offer this product,' tells you something about pent-up demand, or demand from investors who might not be comfortable trading spot crypto.""  Last Thursday, the iShares unit of fund management giant BlackRock (BLK) filed paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the formation of a spot bitcoin (BTC) ETF. Earlier this week, investment management companies Invesco (IVZ) and WisdomTree refiled for spot ETFs.  IVZ, which has $1.4 trillion assets under management, is working in conjunction with digital asset manager Galaxy Digital. It first filed for a spot bitcoin ETF in 2021. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) denied WisdomTree's first application 2022, amid a flurry of rejections.  The surge in institutional interest followed closely after ongoing U.S. regulatory scrutiny seemed to reach new heights earlier this month with SEC lawsuits against exchanges Binance and Coinbase, leaving markets in a funk.  After rising strongly over the first four months of the year, bitcoin, ether and most other major assets inched downward with BTC recently dropping below $25,000 for the first time since mid March as investors contemplated the SEC's increasing scrutiny, inflation and other macroeconomic uncertainties. But even as the wider environment clouded over, institutional interest has continued to percolate.  Cox views the ETFs as ""a positive sign,"" and believes the market is as well. ""It shows that Wall Street still believes in certain parts of crypto and that it's not like the price of Bitcoin is going to zero. We need to understand what the value is. There is value.""

Ripple said that the license will allow its Singapore branch to offer regulated digital payment token products and services as well as further scale its customers' use of its crypto-enabled On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) platform – which saw a 5x growth in the country year-on-year.  “We're pleased that Singapore has taken a forward-looking approach to how to regulate digital assets,” Stu Alderoty, Chief Legal Officer of Ripple, said in an interview with CoinDesk. “With their licensing framework, they have figured out how to create a clear taxonomy for digital assets, balancing the need to protect consumers’ interests and the need to protect the integrity of the markets, while doing so in a way that promotes innovation and investment.”  Ripple said that its Singapore office saw a 50% year-on-year increase in headcount, amounting to 50 full-time staff, hiring across key functions such as business development, compliance, finance, legal, and sales as it ramps up its presence in the country.  A big part of the ramp-up, Alderoty explained, is because Ripple can access the growing licensed digital assets market that’s blooming in the country.  “I think they're attracting responsible actors,” he said. “With this license, we are in company with the likes of Coinbase, Circle, and others that have real businesses, real products and have the wherewithal to play by the rules once the rules are set forth clearly.”  So far, MAS has approved 190 Major Payment Institution licenses and 11 Digital Payment Token Service licenses.

However, the bulls seem to be back in control, as the cryptocurrency price indicates increased buying pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Breaks Above $30,000: Is The Bull Run Back On? Fantom Price Jumps By 15% In 24 Hours – Price Overview Since April 18, FTM has displayed downward price action, contributing to the coin’s negative market sentiment. However, the token’s price is bouncing and showing signs of a recovery by gaining more than 15% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, Fantom has had a generally positive week, showing green on the weekly chart with a 10% price increase. This bullish momentum has slowed the coin’s descent to the yearly low of $0.1997. However, it is worth mentioning that the cryptocurrency is still a long way from its 2023 peak at $0.6345. Fantom reached this price point as far back as February 4 and has declined since, losing more than 53% of its value. According to data from CoinGecko, FTM currently trades at $0.2955, with a 24-hour trading volume of over $121 million. The trading volume experienced a 90.5% increase in the last day, indicating a recent surge in market activity. FTM Price Approaches Significant Resistance Level During its descent, FTM broke the $0.34 support level, falling to a low of $0.21 on June 10. Interestingly, the FTM price formed an evening star candlestick on the daily chart, indicating a bullish reversal. And the price has been on an upswing since then. In addition to the evening star pattern, technical indicators signal a bullish reversal. For instance, the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows a bullish momentum forming, having moved out of the oversold zone. However, it is yet to confirm the trend reversal, with its line barely crossing above 50. An RSI reading above 50 often indicates that a bullish run might be on the horizon, while the bears have the advantage when the RSI reading is below 50. Meanwhile, the daily Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line recently crossed above the signal line, another bullish indicator. FTMUSD trading at $0.302 | Source: FTMUSD chart from TradingView Fantom looks set to target the $0.34 price zone, which is now expected to operate as resistance. Should the FTM price gather enough momentum and break this resistance level, it will likely hit the $0.54 level and perhaps reach a new 2023 peak. On the flip side, if the resistance level holds strong, the FTM bearish trend may continue. The token’s price may fall to a new yearly low beneath $0.1997 in this case. It is worth noting that this analysis is not investment advice. Traders are advised to do their due diligence before risking their funds.

Despite once boasting a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $1.75 billion, ShibaSwap's TVL has plummeted to a mere $25.16 million. The token's developers made headlines by donating a significant portion to Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin and burning a large number of remaining tokens. However, the ongoing liquidity issue has raised worries among Shiba Inu enthusiasts. Liquidity is crucial in the cryptocurrency market, as it signals stability and allows for precise pricing and trading. Unfortunately, the industry has been experiencing a prolonged liquidity crisis, impacting major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The market has seen steep price declines and contentious issues. The duration of the current liquidity problem remains uncertain, leaving many individuals concerned about its resolution. Despite Shiba Inu's impressive market capitalization of $5 billion, its popularity has decreased. The cryptocurrency industry's liquidity problem has affected the market's development, efficiency, and future. Analysts continue to debate the impact of this issue and its potential duration. Overall, the decline in liquidity and its implications for Shiba Inu and the broader cryptocurrency market have captured the attention of crypto enthusiasts. The resolution of the ongoing liquidity issue remains uncertain, leaving stakeholders eagerly awaiting signs of improvement and stability. How Dogecoin (DOGE) Avoided the Same Fate Dogecoin is the first meme cryptocurrency that was created as a lighthearted and meme-inspired digital asset. Unlike Shiba Inu, which has faced liquidity troubles, Dogecoin has a more established market presence and higher liquidity. Dogecoin's liquidity can be attributed to its widespread acceptance and use, as well as its long-standing presence in the cryptocurrency market. Additionally, Dogecoin's active and supportive community plays a significant role in maintaining liquidity by actively trading and promoting the token. As a result, Dogecoin has managed to avoid the liquidity troubles that Shiba Inu has experienced, providing a more stable and liquid investment option for users. Can Caged Beasts (BEASTS) Avoid Shiba Inu's Liquidity Troubles? Caged Beasts ($BEASTS) distinguishes itself from other tokens by offering a secure fund-locking mechanism and implementing the concept of ""Caged Liquidity."" This innovative approach promotes transparency, security, and decentralization in the realm of finance. By securely locking 75% of raised funds until the specified release date, Caged Beasts ensures a solid foundation and mitigates liquidity problems. This unique feature sets it apart from tokens like Shiba Inu, demonstrating a commitment to responsible tokenomics. By providing a visible demonstration of securely locked funds, Caged Beasts instills trust and confidence among investors, paving the way for a sustainable and liquid ecosystem. What Did We Learn? The liquidity troubles faced by Shiba Inu highlight the importance of liquidity in the cryptocurrency market. Liquidity refers to the ability to buy or sell an asset quickly and at a stable price without significantly impacting its value. It is a vital aspect of a healthy market as it ensures stability, efficient trading, and precise pricing. Dogecoin has avoided liquidity problems due to its widespread acceptance and active community, while Caged Beasts has taken a proactive approach by implementing a secure fund-locking mechanism to prevent liquidity issues.

Bitcoin: What You Need To Know,"Summary Gold’s long-held status as the number one safe haven asset is seriously compromised by crypto. Gold is stagnant and crypto remains buoyant and defiant. If the hand of regulation is light on crypto, gold risks becoming ‘boomer Bitcoin’. A halt in crypto’s march to mainstream by regulators would likely see gold surge. While an investor can pick sides, holding some of each is the sensible alternative. Gold: Why isn’t it so much higher? With high inflation gold is meant to take off. That is what is written in every 101 investment book. Yet here is the chart. It is super long term: Long term gold chart (ADVFN) You will notice that gold was very strong but, the moment the hyper money debasement wave starts, its rise stops. There is now a triple top, no moon shot to reflect inflation. A bull will see the base of a potential exponential rise in this chart and a bear will see a fall back to $1000. The only call is: which way is the breakout going to head? Firstly, let me say I have some chunks of gold and was - up until recently - very bullish and up to my ears in precious metals. I read those investment books when I was an infant and I still want to believe. However, as a grizzled old investor I've learnt to ‘trade what I see’ and what I see is little connection of gold stocks values with the price of gold; I see breaks in the linkage of the price of gold and its actual availability, and a disconnect of the gold price from the classic ‘inflation trade’ that is meant to be core and sacred. As such, as I’m left looking for the fool at the table it seems that it may well be me. However, there is always a reason why markets do what they do, and they are very often right. An investor is doing well to get over the barrier of being right half the time, so it’s no good giving up trying to decode the Rosetta Stone of market behaviour just because it doesn’t give up its secrets immediately. So here is a tangent for you... Crypto has the hounds of the US government after it, it is banned in China and various other places but it’s still flying high. That is a mighty achievement. It says there is a huge support for these assets and a lot more than the markets’ total value of less than a trillion suggests. Folks out there back crypto against the weight of global governance. That’s impressive. What is it about Bitcoin that keeps it not just afloat but flying against all these headwinds? The answer is its gold-like properties. The reason I believe gold is going nowhere is its use case as flight capital and safe harbour in extreme situations is hugely undermined and replaced by crypto. Try this mind experiment: How would you feel taking 2kg of gold through an airport? Pretty sweaty I would think! That stress is not even a consideration with $100m of Bitcoin. Now before the old gold bugs reading this start quivering there is potential good news for gold investors. If the US kills crypto or, in effect, chains the financial Prometheus to a rock and has the Eagle of regulation peck out its liver each morning, Bitcoin will lose much of its leverage in this flight capital, haven asset use case. If you choke the on- and off- ramps of crypto into fiat and the banking system - which is the path that regulators wishing to strangle crypto will take - then crypto loses a lot of its current value as an asset that competes with gold. So right now, it looks clear that the US is looking to shut crypto down and halt its passage into the mainstream. If the Republicans get in at the next US presidential election that might change. However, for now, the SEC has made it clear that crypto is just a den of iniquity and it is on a mission to clean house, which amounts to sweeping the bulk of the US industry (or at least their business models) into the gutter. If they do that, up will go gold. If the SEC et alia. accommodate Bitcoin and Ethereum, etc., and let this new industry gently morph into a new financial model, then gold risks becoming ‘boomer Bitcoin,’ a hobbyist’s investment and a legacy asset or just another exotic metal commodity. Alternatively, rather than watch the unpredictable, unreliable, grandstanding wonks, you can just watch for a chart break up or break down to estimate what’s going on in the inside of the machine, because classically these top formations are just staging points for big moves. It the market goes gold up/BTC down or vice versa this will help substantiate the idea that gold and crypto are at loggerheads for the ‘haven/flight asset’ role. The SEC will set the stage for this and all will become clear this summer on whether crypto is to be throttled or allowed in an onshore US future. To me, gold is surprisingly weak and Bitcoin is surprisingly strong and that should be all I need to know that, that is what it is. However, I can’t help seeing the long-term chart and expecting a vertical for gold to make the ‘hockey stick’ that inflation always delivers in assets. My solution is to lazily acquire gold but also crypto, because gold has an awfully long history of value and crypto has a bright long-term future whatever the short term. Diversification is good but it is still not the time to go boots first into either. Yet it is still a good time to slowly build up your stock of these assets because one thing is certain: a cache of safe haven assets cannot be a bad thing to have in this new normal .",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4612886-gold-versus-bitcoin-what-you-need-to-know?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/14064859.jpeg
