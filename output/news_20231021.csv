Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ATMs (Automated Teller Machines), also known as BTMs, are kiosks that enable customers to buy and also sometimes sell bitcoin with cash or a debit card. Designed to make it easy to convert cash to bitcoin, funds are transferred to a consumer’s digital wallet and are verified and recorded on the blockchain, a secured public ledger. But the popularity of BTMs has been losing ground since December, when the number of global BTMs reached an all-time high, the Wednesday report said. The number installed since then has plunged 17% to 32.5K in October. In January 2020, before the pandemic-induced a historic surge in crypto prices, the number of BTMs totaled just 6.36K. AltIndex attributed the decline to “market volatility seen in the past ten months and the controversies about their potentially criminal use.” To that end, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City has laid out a slew of risks of BTMs, from ""predatory inclusion"" to money laundering, that could eventually effect consumers and future regulation. ""The relative anonymity of transactions, along with the speed, convenience, and irreversibility of the cash-to-crypto conversion make BTMs ideal for money launderers,"" the Kansas City Fed wrote in an August article . The U.S., which is home to the largest number of BTMs, saw the biggest drop in BTM installations. As of last week, the world’s largest economy hosted 26.7K machines, down from 34.2K in December. Even so, the U.S. has eighteen times more BTMs than Europe, which had some 1.5K. Asia has the least installed machines at less than 350. Interestingly, the peak in the number of BTM installations late last year coincided with a wider crypto market downturn that led to a barrage of high-profile failures across the industry. Now it appears the BTM/crypto relationship has started to disconnect, with BTM installations down for the year despite higher crypto prices. Although bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) itself climbed 77.2% YTD, it's still down nearly 60% from its record highs. Bitcoin Depot ( BTM ), which allows consumers to buy bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) for cash at over 3.5K locations, has seen its stock drop 73% YTD. Still, B. Riley analyst Hal Goetsch has rated the stock a Buy , calling it a “way to express an investment view for the broader consumer adoption of Bitcoin without being highly correlated to price swings of the cryptocurrency market.” Other BTM operators include: Bullet Blockchain ( OTCPK:BULT ), Santo Blockchain ( OTCPK:SANP ), CoinCloud, CoinFlip, Bitcoin of America, Bitstop, Coinsource and Cash2Bitcoin.

The SEC charged LBRY with making an unregistered securities offering by selling its native LBC tokens. The fallout from this legal fight has prompted worries about unequal access to justice and regulatory overreach in the crypto business, which has disproportionately impacted smaller startups with minimal financial resources. LBRY Inc. reported that the company was compelled to discontinue operations because of obligations owed to the SEC, legal team, and private creditors totaling several million dollars. LBRY Inc. is winding down. The LBRY network is unaffected. Odysee and other assets will undergo a legal process to satisfy debts, but Odysee has a bright future ahead. Thank you to everyone who fought with us for online freedom. A final goodbye post is in the first reply. — LBRY 🚀 (@LBRYcom) October 19, 2023 LBRY’s Financial Struggles The SEC first sought a $22 million penalties, which was later lowered to $111,614. This lowered fine was a major financial blow for LBRY, making it impossible for the company to continue operations. Related Reading: Bulls Thrust Solana To $25 – What Traders Should Expect Next The scenario exemplifies the difficulties that crypto businesses can face when they are pursued by regulatory agencies, particularly smaller startups with minimal financial resources. The SEC has been accused of regulatory overreach in pursuing LBRY, with critics suggesting that the agency should focus on big issues in the crypto business rather than minor instances of securities noncompliance. However, this case highlights the SEC’s ability to control the cryptocurrency market through enforcement proceedings. Ripple’s Contrasting Legal Victory The downfall of LBRY contrasts sharply with Ripple’s recent court success in its ongoing struggle with the SEC. Ripple acquired funding from a multibillion-dollar corporation, allowing it to continue its legal battle. Crypto total market cap currently at $1.10 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com While LBRY Inc.’s controlled operations are ending, the LBRY blockchain, an open-source initiative, may continue to exist if sufficient user engagement is obtained. However, the business stated that decentralization may only succeed if active development and user participation are present. With millions of registered users and a large volume of published material, the LBRY blockchain acted as a decentralized file-sharing network. Odysee, a decentralized social networking platform built on the LBRY blockchain, has a substantial user base. However, its future is now in doubt. In a broader sense, the legal disputes in the crypto business are altering the securities law landscape. Both LBRY and Ripple have been accused with selling unregistered securities, but their outcomes have set developing precedents. Related Reading: Stacks (STX) Rockets 26% Higher In A Single Week: The Factors At Play These results have prompted concerns about the SEC’s capacity to win legal battles against other crypto businesses.

19173627,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=556417,1697907656,"Ethereum Set To Outperform:  Crypto Analyst Predicts 18% Rise To $1,900","Ethereum (ETH) has so far relatively underperformed in comparison to the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin. However, that could change soon enough as a crypto analyst has predicted the second-largest crypto token by market to gain some momentum soon enough. Ethereum To Hit $1900 In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez mentioned that Ethereum could rise to as high as $1,900. His prediction was based on data that he had pulled up from the chart which he shared in his post. Related Reading: XRP Price Set To Surge Amid Heightened Whale Accumulation The chart (a 3-day timeframe) featured an ascending triangle pattern, which usually represents a bullish formation. According to Ali, Ethereum is “poised” to rebound off the hypotenuse of the ascending triangle. Most importantly, for Ethereum to go as high as $1,900, the analyst noted that It has to experience a “firm close” above the 18-day SMA (Simple Moving Average). ETH getting ready to breakout | Source: X If that happens, Ethereum could hit $1,800 and further rise to $1,900 based on Ali’s predictions. It is worth mentioning that the last time Ethereum hit $1,900 was back in July 2023. A rise to that price again will represent about an %18 increase from its current price of $1,600. Ali also had something to say about the flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. In a subsequent post, he noted that the crypto token could see a correction to $28,800; a prediction he made based on the TD Sequential from a 4-hour chart. Bitcoin rose to as high as $30,000 on October 20, with many speculating that a Spot Bitcoin ETF approval could be on the way, something that represents a bullish momentum for Bitcoin and the crypto market in general. ETH price holding $1,600 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com Bitcoin’s Dominance Is On The Rise Data from TradingView shows that Bitcoin’s dominance has been on the rise this year, with the token currently boasting over 52% coin dominance in the crypto market. Interestingly, it has steadily risen since the Ethereum Merge occurred. Related Reading: Here’s Why This Wall Street Expert Believes XRP Is Very Bullish This is significant considering that many speculated that ‘the Flippening’ could happen after the Merge, where Ethereum overtakes Bitcoin to become the most dominant crypto token. However, that hasn’t happened so far, with Ethereum’s move from proof-of-work to proof-of-work being seen as ‘disastrous’ for the crypto token. Bitcoin and Ethereum, however, share the podium when it comes to the best-performing assets of the year. Both crypto tokens are said to have outperformed the NASDAQ, S&P500, and Gold. Bitcoin has seen an %80 increase year-to-date (YTD), while Ethereum has seen a %35 increase YTD.

19168946,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=556411,1697900411,"Ethereum ICO Participant Wakes Up After 8 Years, Moves $3 Million In ETH","The Ethereum initial coin offering (ICO), which took place in 2014, represents one of the most significant events in the history of cryptocurrency. As the network had not begun generating tokens autonomously, the ICO event allowed early investors and enthusiasts to accumulate ETH, currently the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Latest on-chain data shows that one of the ICO participants has become active for the first time in more than eight years, transferring their pre-mined stash of Ether tokens to different addresses on Saturday, October 21. 💤 A dormant pre-mine address containing 2,000 #ETH (3,198,920 USD) has just been activated after 8.2 years!https://t.co/0Mpx77N5fs — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) October 21, 2023 Ethereum ICO Participant Awakens From Dormancy According to blockchain data tracker Lookonchain, the address, which was part of the Ethereum Genesis, initially received 2,000 ETH over eight years ago. At the time, the Ether tokens were purchased for $620 at an ICO price of $0.31 per token. On Saturday, the ETH tokens in question changed wallets for the first time. The wallet holding the pre-mined stash of ETH had been dormant for exactly 8.2 years (July 2015). Thanks to the exponential growth of Ethereum and the entire crypto market, the value of these holdings has grown to nearly $3.2 million at the current price. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Defies Gravity, Here’s What Could Spark Bullish Moves In the X (formerly Twitter) post, Lookonchain highlighted that the ICO participant transferred the Ethereum tokens to four different addresses. About 500 Ether tokens were sent to each address, with minutes separating the transactions. It remains to be seen whether the wallet owner is preparing to sell the tokens, stake on the network, or carry out other transactions. In the event of a sell-off, though, the price of ETH may experience momentary downward pressure. Large transfers from early ICO participants are not exactly common occurrences, but there have already been a couple of similar transactions in 2023. Notably, an ICO participant moved $116 million worth of pre-mined ETH to a Kraken exchange address in July. ETH Price Overview As of this writing, Ethereum’s price stands at $1,605, reflecting a 0.7% decline in the past day. This comes on the back of a week where the value of ETH showed signs of recovery, registering a 3.8% price increase in the past seven days.

Formerly known as Elrond, the project rebranded in 2022 and focused on the Metaverse, scalability, and global adoption by simplifying users’ access to crypto. Related Reading: xDay 2023 Day 3: Interview With Bogdan-Gruia Ivan, Romanian Minister of Research, Innovation and Digitalization During the event’s final day, security audit firm Runtime Verification announced the launch of PI Squared, a universal ZK Rollup that will run on the MultiversX blockchain. The scaling solution is backed by technology developed by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Grigore Rosu, CEO and President at Runtime Verification presented this solution on the event’s main stage. PI Squared aims to make the MultiversX ecosystem more efficient and attract new developers to ship products on this network by reducing verifying computational claims to verifying mathematical proofs. According to a press release shared with our team, the scalability solution will use a universal proof check implemented via a custom ZK circuit. PI Squared was developed as a programming language and Virtual Machine (VM) agnostic. In other words, developers can work on products with any programming language and bring their app to MultiversX more efficiently while maintaining the underlying security and scalability of the MultiversX blockchain. xDay 2023: Interview With Grigore Rosu, CEO Of Runtime Verification After the presentation at xDay 2023, our team got to speak with Grigore Rosu about his impression of xDay, the sentiment, and what PI Squared represents for MultiversX and the entire space, as the solution can be implemented and leveraged by any developer in any programming language. This is what he told us. Q: How do you feel here? What do you think about the atmosphere and the people? A: This is a wonderful conference. It’s unbelievable how many people are here. More than 2000 people. I didn’t expect that. I’ve been at several recent crypto conferences and it was hard to fill the room or even fill the first few rows of seats in the room. But this is just packed with two big amphitheaters and everything is just packed and people are amazing. Discussions are amazing. The MultiversX team is amazing. It’s just wonderful to be here. Q: What makes the MultiversX ecosystem, and their team, unique and why did you decided to work on this network? A: I knew them from day zero. I’m an advisor for Multiverses X and I met Beniamin Mincu (Co-founder of MultiversX) before, right after they had a white paper written (…). I really liked them from the beginning and in one word I think is passion. Indeed, they are very passionate about what they do. They believe in it, and when you believe in something, it happens. Self prophecy, they have one of the fastest, most reliable blockchains out there, the lowest fees. And it has never stalled. Like other blockchains, it works as specified, fast, cheap, and also programming language efficient. I think it was a good idea not to use EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) as an execution infrastructure because EVM is a pretty ad hoc language that was invented quickly to serve a specific purpose to launch Ethereum. But everybody who writes programs or audits them knows that EVM has many limitations. So I think it was a smart that they didn’t use EVM. I would say passion and good decisions along the way. That’s what I like the most about. Q: What does the launch of the PI Square protocol mean for the users? A: So we had this idea for a while now, it took shape. We have a prototype and we needed a destination chain to launch it as a universal ZK roll-up. Speaker 2 (05:09): in PI Square, there is no predetermined language, but we need a destination chain because we do not want to have to implement a decentralized network and consensus algorithms right away. We’d like to stage it. You ultimately, we may do that, but we’d like to stage it. So we’d like to first deploy by squared as a universal scale up on a destination chain. And to be honest, I cannot think of any better destination chain than MultiversX for the same reasons I told you before. It’s cheap. If we do it on Ethereum, for example, we’ll have to pay very high fees to do transactions as we prototype. There is a lot of word prototyping development before you launch and all those translate into transactions, big transactions, very expensive transactions on the destination chain. So think about it this way in one sentence. So PI squared will bring all the programming languages and virtual machines to multiverse X, but without the errors that usually come with compilers or interpreters. Developers will develop programs better faster, and that is expected to increase the number of applications that we’ll see on multiple sec and ultimately more users, happier users.

Formerly known as Elrond, the project rebranded in 2022 and focused on the Metaverse, scalability, and global adoption by simplifying users’ access to crypto. Related Reading: xDay 2023: Elon Musk’s X Competitor? xPortal Unveils Rival Features xDay 2023: “No Time To Waste In Driving Innovation” On the event’s third day, we sat down with Bogdan-Gruia Ivan, Romanian Minister of Research, Innovation and Digitalization. The Minister intends to support the crypto community and builders by attracting capital into the country, giving crypto companies tax exceptions, and implementing a new legal framework to provide them with clarity and security. The Minister sees himself as a “true believer” in blockchain, artificial intelligence, and their capacity to drive innovation in the country. “There is no time to waste,” he said, as he promised to turn words into facts. This is what he told us: Q: How do you feel about the event and projects coming out of MultiversX? A: The first time I was in the Romanian Parliament was 20 years ago. For two years, I served as a member of the Chamber of Deputies. I’m a member of the parliament now, and I feel I have never seen the Romanian Parliament in such a great way, looking so well and having that positive and brilliant vibe about shaping the future. It’s amazing what Beniamin (Mincu) and Multiverse X are doing here. Q: How is Romania going to support MultiversX and the crypto community? Can implementing Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) help you achieve your goals? A: First of all, right now, we already have a Romanian memorandum, an understanding of how we could improve and we are working on a legal framework about technology and about blockchain. Once we pass all reviews from all public institutions, next week, we’ll bring it into the government, and we’ll make it the legal framework for blockchain and emerging technologies. So that is one of the strategic points of developing and putting Romania on the map. The second one is the Romanian AI strategy. We want to launch on 26 September with an entire large debate about our AI strategy and we’ll finish it by the end of the year. And after that, we’ll pass a legal framework for AI. Third, Romania has huge potential, the most brilliant minds of our young people from the IT sector, and with them, we had to figure out how we could improve and be part of quantum technology (…). And in my opinion, Romania could provide, could be the regional provider, and could be the great hub for entire software and for quantum technologies. So in that way, we’ll launch the framework and the national debate about quantum strategy in two or three weeks. Q: Do you think cooperation with crypto projects will extend to other members of the European Union? A: I’m interested in that because we’re part of the change. We are in the same stage with our partners (…). But at the same time, I want Romania to have its own position in that game. So I would like to put Romania on the map, so it can lead the cryptocurrencies and other emerging technologies because of the ecosystem (in the country), because regulations are friendly, because we have that golden mine in the minds of those bright young people. So that’s why I want Romania to lead in crypto and not only in crypto.

On Thursday, October 19th, data from the whale tracker showed two XRP whale transfers some hours before the SEC news. The first transfer was of 31,100,000 XRP worth $15,212,146 to crypto exchange Bitstamp. In the second transfer, 32,300,000 XRP tokens worth $15,794,353 made its way to Bitso. Coincidentally, the price of XRP fell from $0.4878 to $0.4788 that same day. 🚨 31,100,000 #XRP (15,212,146 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Bitstamphttps://t.co/p9wr31zwJQ — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) October 19, 2023 XRP market cap currently at $27.6 billion.

XRP has since pulled back some gains from the XRP news and is now trading at $0.517. However, on-chain data points to a more bullish sentiment than bearish as interest in XRP is now at a high level. During this period of accumulation, XRP’s dominance on social media also reached its second highest this month. Related Reading: Bulls Thrust Solana To $25 – What Traders Should Expect Next We could see XRP reach as high as $1 in the short term if the ‘smart money’ tier traders continue the buying spree, and whales start to join the accumulation. Data from Santiment also shows XRP holders are at a constant rise and this measure is now at 4.81 million wallet addresses. XRP is currently approaching a critical threshold that has previously caused parabolic price spikes. Larsen, one of the co-founders of Ripple, has criticized the SEC after the agency dropped its lawsuit against the company’s founders. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has led the crypto market in gains this week. Bitcoin’s price is up by 10.57% as it edges close to $30,000.

19158373,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=556388,1697883569,Bitcoin Could Benefit From ‘Flight To Quality’ Trend: Report,"In the last seven days, Bitcoin has gone up by 10.50%, following a series of significant gains across the week. Most notably, the largest crypto asset surged by 7% on Monday following the emergence of fake news on the approval of the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Spot ETF. As expected, this price gain drew a plethora of reactions from various crypto enthusiasts and analysts. In particular, Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, stated in an interview with Fox Business that the BTC surge was partially due to the fake news of the spot ETF approval but also because of a growing demand for an investment safe haven. According to Fink, the increasing geopolitical tensions – citing the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict – have created uncertainties driving investors to traditional assets such as gold, but also crypto assets. The BlackRock CEO describes this trend as a “flight to quality.” Related Reading: Bitcoin ETF Approval Anticipated To Trigger Fiat Influx Of $24-50 Billion Dissecting The Bitcoin ‘Flight To Quality’ Theory Following Larry Fink’s statement earlier this week, blockchain analytics and research firm IntoTheBlock has now posted a report evaluating the feasibility of Bitcoin as a “Flight to Quality” asset. In the post on Friday, IntoTheBlock highlighted various factors that backed Fink’s claim. Firstly, the analytic firm stated that US bonds are experiencing a historic sell-off as the 10-year yields on long-term bonds hit 5% this week. Generally, US bonds are considered one of the most secure investment forms. However, developments such as this are usually termed as negative. This is because an increase in bond yield leads to declining demand for existing lower-yielding bonds and in turn, the devaluation of these bonds. As expected, this increasing bond yield has resulted in a 20% depreciation of long-term US bonds over the last six months. Meanwhile, there has been a significant 53% decline in the value of these investment assets since March 2020. Related Reading: Bitcoin Knocks At The Door Of $30,000, But Can Break Happen? Bitcoin Records Less Volatility Than US Treasuries Furthermore, IntoTheBlock highlighted that Bitcoin’s volatility is currently lower than that of these US long-term bonds, indicating it offers a higher level of stability to traditional investors looking at the value of their investment. Finally, the research firm pointed out Bitcoin’s remarkable performance during this bond market crash, likening it to the asset’s positive price movement during the series of US bank collapses earlier in 2023. The blockchain research firm noted the crypto market leader tallies with gold with a 7% gain already in October and is receiving more recognition as a favorable alternative investment asset by several Wall Street financial experts. Considering all the factors listed above, IntoTheBlock states that there are growing signs that Bitcoin is becoming a safe haven for traditional investors and could largely benefit from a “Flight to Quality” movement, especially with the potential launch of spot Bitcoin ETF. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $29,667 with a 0.27% loss in the last day. In tandem, the token’s daily trading volume is down by 18.70% and is currently valued at $15.86 billion.

19136791,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=556348,1697850055,Coinbase Bullish: Bitcoin ETF Approval Expected After SEC’s Defeat,"In a recent CNBC report, Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, expressed confidence in the approval of a US-based Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, highlighted that the SEC’s recent court setback in the case of Grayscale’s proposed Bitcoin ETF has paved the way for a potential approval in the coming months. Coinbase Eyes Bitcoin ETF Approval Grewal emphasized that Coinbase is hopeful about the approval of ETF applications due to their compliance with existing laws governing financial services. Grewal noted that prominent financial institutions have submitted robust proposals, indicating progress in the regulatory landscape. The recent court ruling against the SEC stated that the regulator lacked a valid basis to deny Grayscale’s request to convert its GBTC Bitcoin fund into an ETF. Related Reading: xDay 2023: Elon Musk’s X Competitor? xPortal Unveils Rival Features The SEC chose not to appeal the ruling within the specified deadline, further increasing the likelihood of a BTC-related ETF gaining approval shortly. However, Grewal acknowledged that the ultimate decision rests with the SEC, and he refrained from providing a specific timeline for the approval process. Nevertheless, Grewal expressed confidence in the SEC’s obligation to fulfill its responsibilities, particularly in light of the court’s decision and the requirement to apply the law impartially. The introduction of a Bitcoin ETF would offer investors an alternative means to gain exposure to BTC without directly purchasing the cryptocurrency from an exchange. This could be particularly attractive to retail investors seeking Bitcoin exposure without the complexities of owning the underlying asset. Per the report, Coinbase, being the largest crypto exchange in the United States, stands to benefit from the potential approval of a BTC ETF. The company’s common stock is held in portfolios designed to provide investors with crypto exposure. Legal Troubles Mount For Grayscale’s Parent Company While the recent court ruling has bolstered prospects for a BTC ETF, it is important to note that Grayscale’s bid to convert GBTC into an ETF is not without its challenges. Digital Currency Group (DCG), Grayscale’s parent company, along with crypto exchange Gemini and DCG subsidiary Genesis, face a lawsuit from the New York Attorney General, accusing them of defrauding investors of over $1 billion. Related Reading: Bulls Thrust Solana To $25 – What Traders Should Expect Next Despite the ongoing legal issues, Grewal remained positive about the approval of additional Bitcoin ETFs in the future as the SEC adheres to the law and evaluates pending applications neutrally. The report also touched upon the recent performance of BTC, which has experienced a resurgence in 2023. With a 72% year-to-date increase, Bitcoin has rebounded from significant declines in 2022. Factors such as anticipation surrounding the upcoming BTC halving event and investor reactions to the Federal Reserve’s potential interest rate policy changes have contributed to increased demand for the digital currency. Ultimately while trading volumes have declined recently, attributed partly to retail investors’ reduced engagement in response to low volatility and industry players’ challenges, Grewal expressed optimism that various developments, including criminal trials and rigorous regulatory actions, will restore investor and consumer interest in the crypto market. As the landscape for Bitcoin ETFs evolves, market participants will closely monitor the SEC’s stance and any potential regulatory developments that shape the future of cryptocurrency investment products.
