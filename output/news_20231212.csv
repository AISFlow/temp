Basics: How To Create A Crypto Token Creating a crypto token is an intricate process that combines technical skills with a deep understanding of the blockchain ecosystem. This task requires not just programming prowess but also a strategic approach to ensure your token aligns with market needs and regulatory standards. The concept of a crypto token encompasses a digital asset built on a blockchain. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are native to their respective blockchains, tokens are created using the existing blockchain’s infrastructure. They represent various assets or utilities, from digital art and virtual real estate to governance rights within a decentralized network. Remarkably, the history of crypto tokens is marked by significant events, notably the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) boom around 2017. This period witnessed a surge in token creation, as startups and projects used ICOs to raise capital by issuing tokens. While this led to groundbreaking innovations, it also attracted scrutiny due to the prevalence of scams and lack of regulation. A recent success story in the crypto token space is PEPE coin, launched on April 16, 2023. It quickly gained popularity, notably among memecoin enthusiasts. PEPE coin, developed as a tribute to the meme character Pepe the Frog, reached a market cap of $1.61 billion in less than three weeks after its launch. Step-by-Guide: How To Create A Token Creating a crypto token is a complex process, requiring a blend of technical expertise and strategic planning. Here’s a more detailed guide on “how to create a crypto token”: #1 Specify The Purpose Of Your Token The purpose of your token is foundational. Are you creating a utility token to facilitate transactions within a specific ecosystem, a security token to represent digital shares of an asset, or a governance token to allow holder participation in decision-making? Understanding and clearly defining the utility, target audience, and problem your token addresses is critical for its relevance and success. #2 Choose A Blockchain Your choice of blockchain affects the token’s functionality, scalability, and security. Consider Ethereum for its well-established infrastructure and strong support for ERC-20 tokens. Other blockchains like Binance Smart Chain or Cardano offer different advantages like lower transaction fees or enhanced scalability. Assess the community support, development tools, and consensus mechanisms of each blockchain to find the best fit for your token. #3 Create A Whitepaper A whitepaper is crucial for gaining trust and interest. It should comprehensively detail your token’s purpose, technology, governance model, and economic mechanics. Include technical details, projected use cases, and a clear roadmap. A good whitepaper is transparent about the token’s features, risks, and long-term vision, helping to establish credibility among potential investors and users. #4 Set Up A Node Setting up a node on the Ethereum network is a critical step for anyone looking to create a token. This process is essential because it ensures direct and reliable access to the blockchain. By operating a node, creators maintain a personal copy of the entire Ethereum ledger, allowing for real-time tracking of transactions and network activity. This direct connection to the Ethereum network not only enhances security but also provides greater control over the transactions associated with the token. #5 Develop Smart Contracts And Test Them Smart contracts are the core of your token’s functionality on the blockchain. They must be coded carefully to manage the token’s operations securely and efficiently. Post-development, testing these contracts on a testnet is vital to identify and fix vulnerabilities, ensuring reliability and security. This stage may involve multiple iterations to refine the contract’s functionality. #6 Deploy On Mainnet Deploying your token on the mainnet brings it to life. This step requires precision and often a fee, known as gas in Ethereum. Ensure your smart contracts are thoroughly tested before this step, as deploying on the mainnet makes the contracts immutable and any errors irreversible. #7 Distribute And Market Develop a strategy for distributing your token. This might involve initial offerings like ICOs, airdrops to potential users, or partnerships with exchanges for listing. Marketing is key to building awareness and credibility. Utilize social media, community engagement, and partnerships to spread the word about your token and its use cases. #8 Maintain And Update Post-launch, it’s essential to maintain your token’s ecosystem. This includes monitoring the token’s performance, updating smart contracts as needed, and responding to community feedback. Regular updates and improvements will help maintain the token’s relevance and value in a rapidly evolving market. Coding Necessary?

Cramer has, at various points, called for investors to sell their Bitcoin but with the crypto’s price continuing to go up after his calls, here’s how much Bitcoin has gained since Cramer last called for a BTC sell-off. Counter-Trading Jim Cramer’s Advice On Bitcoin Back in 2022 when the FTX crypto exchange collapsed and filed for bankruptcy, the Bitcoin price had fallen more than 50% to trade below $15,000. This crash took place in November 2022 and a few months later, there was a slight recovery in price and Cramer gave one of his infamous ‘Sell Bitcoin Now’ advice. Related Reading: Solana-Based Meme Coin Outperforms Dogecoin, Shiba Inu To Become 3rd-Largest As shown in a video of Cramer shared by the parody account @CramerTracker on X (formerly Twitter), the Mad Money show host can be seen advising investors to sell their Bitcoin. At the time, the asset’s price had risen around 4% in one week to $24,000 and Cramer believed this was an opportunity to sell. According to him, BTC’s price was being manipulated, and selling into the slight pump was the best thing. Cramer also asserted that the ‘price manipulation’ has made him no longer believe in the asset. “I would sell my Bitcoin right into this rally,” Cramer said. “Believe me, I had been a believer one time in Bitcoin. Not here. Not now,” the show host further added. In true Cramer fashion, he would turn out to be wrong less than a year later as Bitcoin’s price would keep going up. In fact, buying Bitcoin at the time when Cramer advised investors to sell proved to be one of the best buying opportunities. From Cramer’s sell call at $24,000 to now, the price has increased by 80%. This means that if an investor had bought $100,000 in BTC when Cramer said sell and held until now, they would have a whopping $180,000 in their portfolio, meaning an $80,000 profit in less than one year.

21326436,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=565043,1702418409,Shiba Inu News: Shibarium Hits Another Major Milestone,"Shibarium, the Ethereum-based layer 2 blockchain solution from the Shiba Inu team, has achieved yet another major milestone, showcasing growing strength within the platform. Shiba Inu Shibarium’s Latest Important Milestone The Shiba Inu layer 2 platform has recently crossed a significant milestone in terms of total transactions processed as total transactions have increased dramatically over the past few weeks. According to Shibariumscan – the network tracker, Shibarium has crossed over 90 million transactions performed in the platform since its introduction. Data from the network tracker shows that the number is currently sitting at approximately 90,677,816 as of the time of writing. Related Reading: Shibarium Transactions Sees 4,400% Explosion, Time For SHIB And BONE ATH? It is noteworthy that since December 2, the Shiba Inu blockchain has continuously maintained a whopping average of 7.5 million daily transactions. Currently, the total number of daily transactions revealed by the network’s tracker is totaled at 7.84 million transactions. The network’s activity appears to be growing significantly, reaching major milestones over the past few weeks. Earlier this month, the total number of transactions in Shibarium was sitting at 66 million, indicating over 35% increase since this month. Data from Shibariumscan also revealed an uptick in the network’s total blocks and wallet addresses. Shibarium’s total number of blocks is approximately 2,077,814, while the total number of wallet addresses is 1,305,042. This kind of surge in transactions means that millions of BONE tokens were spent on transaction fees. As a result of this, it prepares the stage for the much-anticipated Shiba Inu token burn. However, despite the recent surge in transactions, the Shiba Inu burn rate is still down in the past 24 hours. According to Shibburn, the SHIB token burn rate is down by 91% over the past 24 hours. It is worth noting that Shiba Inu recently saw its highest burn rate ever since the initiative was introduced. Last week, the project saw an astounding 7,686,774% increase in burn rate, destroying about 8.35 billion SHIB tokens. Shibarium Migrates To Sepolia Network Last week, Shiba Inu announced that Shibarium will be adopting the Sepolia network. The team pointed out that Shibarium Puppynet will be moved from the Goerli Network to the Sepolia Network. The goal of this adjustment is to be in line with more effective and scalable infrastructures, according to the team. Additionally, the transition will pave the way for more advanced solutions. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Set To Establish A New Era For Shibarium Burns Furthermore, the move is not merely a transition, but an upgrade that will enable a more efficient and user-friendly environment. This is because of the growing demands of the blockchain community, particularly in fields such as NFTs and DeFi. Sepolia provides a testing environment that is more stable and controlled, precisely replicating the Ethereum mainnet’s features and functionalities. Due to this, developers are guaranteed access to a dependable and consistent platform for testing their dApps and smart contracts. The team asserted that this strategic shift will become live on December 15, 2023.

Halt in BTC's momentum saw many altcoins jump, with DOT, ATOM, INJ, TIA among the biggest gainers.  Market observers widely anticipate the Fed will pause rate hikes on Wednesday's FOMC meeting.  Bitcoin's [BTC] price stabilized around $41,000 Tuesday ahead of this year's last U.S. interest rate decision due Wednesday as crypto traders digested yesterday's major leverage flush and largest daily drawdown since mid-August.  The largest crypto asset recovered to $42,000 earlier in the day from yesterday's low of $40,200 before dipping to $40,600 in the U.S. afternoon hours. After paring some losses, BTC was changing hands at $41,300, slightly up 0.3% over the past 24 hours.  Ether [ETH], the second largest cryptocurrency, declined 1% during the same period, below $2,200.  While the momentum of the two leading cryptocurrencies slowed, many altcoins jumped through the day.  Native tokens of Polkadot [DOT], Cosmos [ATOM] and Injective [INJ] were among the best-performing crypto majors, gaining 10%-20% over the past 24 hours.  Avalanche [AVAX] overtook the popular dog-themed meme token dogecoin's [DOGE] market capitalization, gaining nearly 5% on the day and more than doubling its price in a month.  Recently launched blockchain data solution Celestia [TIA] surged 20% to a new all-time high as it announced that it will become an option for blockchain builders using Polygon's software tools to spin up new layer-2 networks atop Ethereum.  Venture capital-backed blockchain Aptos' token [APT] also rallied 16%, defying the release of over $200 million worth of previously locked-up tokens to its outstanding supply earlier today, according to Token.Unlocks.  The CoinDesk Market Index [CMI], which tracks a weighted basket of almost 200 digital assets, was up 1.2% over the past 24 hours.  The Federal Reserve, the central bank of the U.S., is widely expected to hold Fed fund rates steady at 5.25%-5.5%, concluding the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting Wednesday as Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation continued to edge lower in November.  ""Disinflation is in full force and the latest round of CPI data for November 2023 is further proof that the trend is intact,"" Caleb Franzen, founder of Cubic Analytics posted on X.  Slowing inflation nudges the Fed to pause rate hikes Wednesday for the third consecutive occasion. At the same time, investors will monitor Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference for signs of potential rate cuts next year.  ""It is commonly expected that a pause in rate hikes could be interpreted as a bullish signal for the market,"" Bitfinex analysts said in an emailed note.

Shibarium Transaction Count Breaches 90 Million Milestone,"Shibarium, the Shiba Inu Ethereum Layer 2 network, has been ramping up in the last few weeks. The rapid rate of adoption has led to a rise in the number of transactions being carried out on the network on a daily basis, leading to a new milestone. Over 90 Million Transactions Carried Out On Shibarium According to data available from ShibariumScan, the total number of transactions carried out on the Shiba Inu Layer 2 network has now crossed the 90 million mark. This comes after multiple days of over 6.5 million transactions being recorded on the network on a daily basis. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Explains Why The Bitcoin Price Crash To $40,000 Is Not A Bad Thing Between Sunday and Monday alone, there were over 7.8 million transactions carried out on the Shibarium network. At the same time, there has also been an uptick in the growth rate of accounts on the network. It went from trending around 30,000 at the end of November to over 54,000 just two weeks into December. This represents a growth rate of almost 100% in the accounts on the network. Source: ShibariumScan Active accounts also followed a similar trajectory as the daily transactions, reaching a new all-time high of 9,339 on December 5. However, this metric seems to be undergoing a full retracement after falling to 3,232 on December 10. It means that users are starting to scale back their activity on the network. The number of new accounts created in a single day also touched a new all-time high in December. Data shows it reached 4,456 on December 3, and then 4,399 on December 5. But just like the active accounts metric, new accounts created on the network have dropped approximately 92% to just 368 by December 10. SHIB price tumbles to $0.0000096 | Source: SHIBUSD on Tradingview.com Can This Trigger A Shiba Inu Rally To $0.0001? While the growth rate of the Shibarium network is no doubt good for Shiba Inu, it is doubtful that it will have any significant impact on the price. This is because Shiba Inu is only the governance token of the network while BONE is the main utility token. So the network’s growth is likely to have a direct impact on the price of BONE rather than SHIB. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price In Turmoil: Major Events That Could Affect Price This Week As for SHIB reaching the $0.0001 price target, market experts at Telegoan have said that it may reach this mark in the year 2025. They also believe that the meme coin could rise as high as $0.000728 in the same year if market conditions are right. In the short term, an expected $1 million worth of burns may be what ends up propelling the meme coin’s price. Shiba Inu lead dev Shytoshi Kusama confirmed that the over $1.2 million accumulated from BONE fees on the Shibarium network may be used to burn SHIB. As the SHIB supply reduces, the token’s value is expected to rise.

42391741,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfvzYx,1702410842,Warren’s Crypto Bill Is Likely Unconstitutional. It’s Also Unlikely to Pass,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D–Mass.) is trying to force feed the American people a poison pill. The high-profile legislator, known today as much for her disdain of cryptocurrency as for Big Banks, has submitted a bill for consideration looking to crackdown on crypto’s alleged use in illicit finance.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  On Monday, five Democratic lawmakers joined to co-sponsor the so-called ""Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act."" If passed, the law would extend Bank Secrecy Act requirements including know-your-customer (KYC) rules to miners, validators, wallet providers and other crypto industry actors.  Three of the five new sign-ons are colleagues of Warren on the Senate Banking Committee. They are: Sens. Raphael Warnock (D-GA), Laphonza Butler (D-CA) and Chris Van Hollen (D-MD). The committee is a powerful body in the Senate, responsible for passing laws that regulate one of the U.S. largest economic sectors and that will likely influence what legislative proposals will be considered next year.  That said, Warren’s bill, as it exists, is unlikely to pass for many of the same reasons U.S. governance is often hamstrung: partisan politics, infighting and gridlock.  And that is a good thing, not only for the crypto industry — where many leaders have already come out forcefully against the bill — but for the American public. The anti-money laundering act, while likely conceived with the best intentions, comes with some truly worrisome conditions attached.  Much ink has already been spilled over the bill, so I won’t rehash much of the debate other than saying Warren’s bill essentially would make it illegal to use crypto in the U.S. and put severe restrictions around writing code meant to provide people with similar privacy guarantees as paper money.  Some, like industry lobbyists at Coin Center, have noted the law would likely be unconstitutional.  See also: ‘We're Not Asking for Special Treatment’: Coin Center on the Proposed IRS Broker Rules  It likely won’t pass for other reasons — in part, after the mess that FTX caused, U.S. legislators are intent on passing actual crypto regulatory reforms, and Warren’s bill — instead of taking aim at the issues in blockchain that enabled Sam Bankman-Fried’s rise and fall — is focused on the incredibly narrow issue of surveillance. It just isn’t a good use of time, to say nothing of all the other ways U.S. lawmakers seem to waste the days of the years.  But it is interesting that this bill is coming up at this time. In fact, Warren’s DAAMA bill is likely unconstitutional in a very similar way that another truly worrisome congressional proposal is likely unconstitutional: it’s seeking to expand surveillance over the bits and bobs of popular digital technologies.  ‘Surrogate spies’  As Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, noted on social media about the FISA Reform and Reauthorization Act of 2023:  “RED ALERT: Buried in the House intelligence committee’s Section 702 ‘reform’ bill, which is schedule[d] for a floor vote as soon as tomorrow [Dec. 12, today], is the biggest expansion of surveillance inside the United States since the Patriot Act.  Without going into too many specifics, the so-called reform bill (meant to reauthorize Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, aka FISA) would expand provisions in existing laws that already compel internet and other communication service providers to assist law enforcement and intelligence agencies to turn in information about suspect users.  Goitein notes that by expanding a definition of a “provider,” those agencies would now be able to compel even more information from even more phone, email and text messaging records.  She mentioned companies that may offer clients WiFi like “hotels, libraries [and] coffee shops,” because they may run a router that connects to the internet and that figures into the communications chain. It’s not just deputizing these companies, it’s turning them into “surrogate spies.”  This is, in the grand scheme of things, exactly how Warren’s AML operates. Warren’s proposal is written in such a way to increase reporting requirements for nearly every corner of crypto. This includes anything from centralized exchanges, where filing “suspicious activity reports” (SARs) might make sense, and for parts and players in blockchain where the concept of collecting information on users is … asinine, like node operators and software developers.  Whether or not the bill makes sense, or even if its proposed expansion of the Bank Secrecy Act is the right tool for the job (the BSA is arguably unconstitutional, as Coin Center’s Peter Valkenburgh argues, and ineffective because SARs do not prevent crime just limit banks’ liability, as ex-CoinDesk David Z. Morris writes), the matter of intent matters.  Warren, who has used her “war on crypto” as a means of soliciting campaign donations, is clearly trying to make a name for herself being tough on crime. Crypto may think crypto is punk and radical, but there are clearly parts of the industry that benefit Wall Street, big time. So Warren’s messaging is at least on brand.  Her legislative proposals are not always successful (though out of the 330 bills she’s written in a decade-long career, she did enact the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which for better or worse is impressive). But some have argued she’s just trying to shift the “Overton Window” (what is politically possible to get done) and to reinforce crypto’s (deserved and undeserved) association with crime.  The bill serves the big aim of attacking crypto as a trend as well as the narrow issue of crypto’s use to fund terrorism, launder ill-gotten gains and in other criminal activities.  See also: What New Yorkers Think of the SEC's War Against Crypto  ""Crypto should be governed by the same transparency rules as traditional banks to protect Americans and help ensure it isn’t used to facilitate illegal behavior by criminal enterprises and rogue nations,” Warren’s new co-sponsor Van Hollen said.  That’s all well and good, until you consider how the supposed finance experts in the room are trying to get there: by criminalizing communications. More troubling, it’s not the first time and likely won’t be the last.  As Goitein said:  “At the end of the day, though, the government’s claimed intent matters little. What matters is what the provision, on its face, actually allows—because as we all know by now, the government will interpret and apply the law as broadly as it can get away with.”  See also: Code Is Not (Always) Law | Opinion",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/12/12/warrens-crypto-bill-is-likely-unconstitutional-its-also-unlikely-to-pass,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/093cebb2ddcf543201ee0e3a8c3d3fecfeec90f2-2006x1020.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Exchange Inflows Are Up, But So Are USDT Deposits According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, BTC has been flowing into exchanges recently. The relevant indicator here is the “supply on exchanges,” which keeps track of the percentage of a cryptocurrency’s total circulating supply that’s currently sitting in the wallets of all centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric goes up, it means that the investors are making net deposits of the asset into these platforms, while a decline implies outflows are taking place. Related Reading: Crypto Market Crashes: Traders React With “Buy The Dip” Calls What effect either of these trends might have on the market depends on the type of cryptocurrency in question. Santiment has shared the below chart, which shows how the supply on exchanges has recently changed for four assets: Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT), and USD Coin (USDC). The trends in the exchange supplies of the different top cryptocurrencies | Source: Santiment on X As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange supplies had both been on the decline earlier, but recently, BTC has diverged from this downtrend and registered some net deposits. These deposits first started after BTC finished its rally to $44,000 and took to sideways movement. Generally, one of the main reasons why holders might deposit their coins to exchanges is for selling purposes, so these recent inflows can be a sign that selling has been taking place. The uptrend in the supply on exchanges also became a bit sharper in the leadup to the asset’s latest plunge, suggesting that the inflows have indeed been adding to the selling pressure. From the chart, it’s also visible that the Bitcoin supply on exchanges hasn’t yet reversed its trend, a potential indication that selling hasn’t completely exhausted yet. Meanwhile, Ethereum has continued to see supply exit these central entities, implying that investors of the cryptocurrency are possibly still participating in net accumulation. Something that could prove to be positive for BTC, though, is the fact that the Tether supply on exchanges has risen since the plunge. Investors usually make use of stablecoins like USDT and USDC whenever they want to escape the volatility associated with coins like BTC and ETH, but such investors generally only do this as a temporary measure. When the holders plan to leave the cryptocurrency sector as a whole, they do so through fiat instead. Opting for stablecoins instead, thus, means that they intend to stay in the market and possibly eventually return back towards the volatile side. Sizeable swaps from stables into Bitcoin and others can naturally provide a buying boost to their prices, so exchange inflows of them can be a bullish sign for these volatile assets. Related Reading: BONK Soars 18%, But Analyst Warns Of Impending Correction The most bullish combination is when BTC rallies while the USDT exchange supply does the same, as such a trend suggests that fresh capital is entering into the sector. In the current case, the Tether exchange supply has gone up at the expense of BTC’s price, so only a rotation of capital has occurred. Nonetheless, the fact that not all capital has exited the sector as a whole can still be an optimistic sign for the rally’s return. BTC Price Bitcoin had plunged towards $40,000 yesterday, but the coin has already made some swift recovery as it’s now trading around the $41,700 level.

""Over the past four months Conic has undergone extensive auditing and review in preparation of v2 deployment,"" a governance post reads. ""Now that all audits are nearly finalized it’s time to prepare Conic for launch.""  The protocol's governance token CNC jumped about 50% to $2.20 immediately after the announcement, CoinGecko data shows.  Conic Finance allows liquidity providers to diversify exposure to multiple liquidity pools and earn yields on major DeFi platform Curve Finance via so-called Omnipools.  According to the governance post, the protocol will hold voting in two days about the list of supported Omnipool assets, whitelisted Curve pools for each Omnipool and initial liquidity allocation weights. Once the votes conclude, a separate governance proposal about the v2 deployment will include new features, reimbursement schemes and incentives.  The comeback plan follows a hacker attack on the protocol in July, which saw roughly 1,700 ETH, worth over $3.6 million at the time, drained from Conic's ETH Omnipool exploiting a ""read-only reentrancy"" bug. The total value locked (TVL) on Conic recently dropped to below $1 million from around $150 million before the attack, according to DefiLlama data.

A less optimistic prediction by Changelly puts a $1 prediction by the end of 2025. #ADA is about to get a bullish weekly cross for the first time since JUNE 2020 The last time this happened it pumped 6,000% over the next 66 weeks#cardano pic.twitter.com/xQvvbf3b1O — Tyler Strejilevich (@TylerSCrypto) December 9, 2023 The bullish crossover is yet to happen, and the token still has a few weeks to see how this would play out. Of course, in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, there’s no guarantee the price will move as predicted. Nevertheless, Cardano is poised for a major rally that could extend into the coming year. ADA price continues to show strength | Source: ADAUSD on Tradingview.com Current Bullish Performance Of ADA Network activity, increase in DeFi TVL, and other factors point to Cardano continuing on its current bull run. It’s important to note that the last time Cardano went on this 6000% price gain, its blockchain network was still behind on smart contract functionality. However, the network has changed since then, with Cardano now one of the fastest-growing blockchains in terms of smart contracts.

The trio, two Republicans – entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson – and Democrat Rep. Dean Phillips, promised to ease regulatory pressures on crypto companies during the hours-long event hosted by the Coinbase-backed Stand with Crypto Alliance. While their approaches varied in tone and scope, they shared a common theme: Creating a clear, cohesive regulatory framework for digital assets.  “Whether or not something is a commodity or a security, [businesses] deserve to know rather than playing regulatory musical chairs,” Ramaswamy said after calling regulatory overreach on the crypto sector a “cancer.”  Each candidate delivered a speech on crypto policymaking and fielded questions from CoinDesk Regulations and Policy Editor Jesse Hamilton. Their comments centered on the creation of a unified regulatory framework, from curbing federal regulators’ powers to educating policymakers about crypto and protecting coders from criminal charges. The consonance between those proposals contrasted with the political dissonance that has stymied recent efforts on Capitol Hill to create a regulatory rulebook for the industry.  Dunking on the SEC, Big Banks  While the speakers’ comments were often constructive, they also degenerated, at times, into shameless self-promoting spiels. All three blasted the Securities Exchange Commission's crackdown on crypto exchanges including Coinbase, Kraken and Binance, and called for the agency’s powers to be curtailed.  “We want to see an SEC that… [doesn’t treat] everybody they're regulating as an adversary,” Hutchinson said as he called for an end to regulators’ “guidance-by-enforcement” strategies.  Ramaswamy vowed to reduce the agency’s workforce as part of his goal to eliminate 75% of bureaucratic jobs, noting that the third U.S. president, Thomas Jefferson, who died nearly 200 years ago, would be “turning in his grave” over the agency’s actions toward crypto, a technology that was invented roughly 15 years ago.  None of the participants are leading in their parties' primary election polls, meaning they probably won't have the powers of the presidency at their disposal to promote crypto.  Later, the hopefuls discussed how blockchain technology could disrupt traditional finance (TradFi), laying the groundwork for a fairer, trustless financial system.  “There's more transparency actually in the crypto market than there is in banks and traditional finance,” Hutchinson said.  Crypto “eliminates so many hands in the pot that take little bits [of peoples’ money] ... at a time when life is already so unaffordable,” said Phillips.

42391745,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfvzjD,1702400529,A Difficult Truth: The Unspoken Mismatch of Web3 and Generative AI,"The intersection of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and Web3 is one of the most fascinating trends in the digital assets space. While most people agree that generative AI is likely to play a role in the next generation of Web3 technologies, the specifics are far from trivial. After all, AI was never considered an important building block in Web3 architectures, and the different generations of L1s and L2s were not designed to run AI workloads.  The reality confronted by Web3 technologists when trying to envision adapting Web3 runtimes to generative AI technologies is an overwhelming mismatch in terms of data and computation requirements. Generative AI workloads are designed to be computationally intensive, running on highly parallelizable GPUs. Blockchain runtimes are quite limited in terms of their data and computation capabilities.  Jesus Rodriguez is the CEO of IntoTheBlock.  At the same time, Web3 desperately needs to incorporate generative AI capabilities in order to catch up with Web 2 alternatives. The obvious question then becomes: how would the integration of generative AI and Web3 materialize?  From all the trends in generative AI, there is one that seems to be ideal for the incorporation of blockchain capabilities and that, coincidentally, gathered mainstream attention through the recent announcements made by OpenAI in its Developer Days conference: have you heard of autonomous agents?  Here, I would like to explore two key points:  Why most Web3 capabilities are only adding marginal benefits to the current wave of generative AI solutions.  Why autonomous agents are the one trend in generative AI that can incorporate Web3 capabilities.  The mismatch  We regularly read overhyped publications about how blockchain and generative AI technologies are a match made in heaven. Those statements are good for making headlines, but they lack the technical rigor of understanding the current state of both technologies. Going deep into understanding the possible integration paths between Web3 and generative AI reveals a very challenging picture.  Following a first-principles approach to think about the potential integration between generative AI and Web3, we can consider two fundamental dimensions:  A new generation of Web3 technologies that will leverage generative AI capabilities.  Generative AI solutions that could incorporate blockchain technologies.  The first vector is quite puzzling. On one hand, we can clearly imagine a new generation of DeFi protocols or blockchain runtimes that will incorporate intelligent capabilities powered by generative AI. On the other hand, those use cases are very nascent or almost non-existent.  The second category offers a wider set of opportunities but is equally challenging. Psychologically, it is very tempting to try to adapt modern Web3 capabilities such as zero-knowledge computation to decentralized stacks for generative AI solutions. It shouldn't come as a surprise that we are seeing an increasing number of zero-knowledge (zk) or decentralized stacks for generative AI. While certainly interesting, those solutions seem quite mismatched with the current wave of generative AI stacks.  Read more: Jesus Rodriguez - AI Should Be Decentralized, but How?  For instance, zero-knowledge computation could unlock some use cases in terms of transparency in generative AI, but its computational costs make it extremely impractical to be applied at the scale of large transformer models. Similarly, decentralized GPU architectures are impractical for pretraining or fine-tuning generative AI models, given that they require an incredibly fast communication bus between GPUs.  Bridging the gap between generative AI and Web3 technologies requires more than a match of technological capabilities; it requires that these capabilities are a fit for the current use cases in both technology stacks. In that sense, there is a hot trend in generative AI that seems like a perfect candidate for Web3 stacks.  Enter semi-autonomous agents  If you follow the generative AI space, you probably have come across projects such as AutoGPT, BabyAGI, or the just-announced OpenAI GPTs, which are based on semi-autonomous agent capabilities. The simplest version of semi-autonomous agents is intelligent models that can reason through abstract tasks, formulate, and execute plans in a given environment.  Consider an agent that is specialized in executing market research for a specific domain. This agent can start with an abstract goal such as ""research a specific product"" and formulate a plan to consult the appropriate information sources, summarize the information using a large language model, and distribute it to different parties. Semi-autonomous agents enhance foundation models with capabilities such as memory, tool integration, security guardrails, and many others.  In the last few months, semi-autonomous agents have gone from an obscure research topic to one of the hottest trends in generative AI. The semi-autonomous nature of this technology is precisely what makes it an ideal scenario for blockchain runtimes. In the current state of semi-autonomous agent technologies, there are four dominant use cases that are a good fit for blockchain runtimes. These use cases are not theoretical but rather real challenges facing semi-autonomous agent applications:  1) Transparency: One of the main value propositions of semi-autonomous agents is their ability to formulate and execute actions in a given environment. Blockchain runtimes can act as a system of record for those plans and decisions.  2) Decentralized Coordination: One of the ultimate goals of semi-autonomous agents is that they can collaborate to accomplish a specific goal. This level of collaboration requires decentralized coordination, which is a perfect fit for blockchains. You can imagine a scenario in which one agent can discover the capabilities of other agents via their smart contracts and interact with them.  3) Guardrails: Once agents start taking actions semi-autonomously, the idea of setting up guardrails around them to constrain the potential impact of those actions becomes increasingly relevant. Smart contracts represent an ideal mechanism to establish immutable guardrails around agents. Imagine an agent that can make financial decisions given a credit application, guard-railed by a smart contract that ensures that no sensitive information is produced as part of the outputs.  4) Economic Incentives: In the context of collaboration, crypto assets can play a significant role, serving as a key economic layer for semi-autonomous agents. Let's take the example of an agent that can generate marketing materials for a specific product using expensive image generation models. In that scenario, the agents can receive payments via crypto assets and execute the function autonomously.  Why semi-autonomous agents?  Regardless of our passion for Web3 tech, we can clearly see that generative AI is evolving just fine without the help of blockchain runtimes. Finding a match between these two technology trends is not a very easy endeavor. The Web3 scenarios for generative AI are very nascent or non-existent.  The point then becomes finding the real challenges in generative AI that can be addressed with blockchain technologies. By ""real,"" I mean not derived from a theoretical exercise, and keeping in mind that we are trying to match a technology with limited adoption in the real world with the fastest-growing technology trend of many generations.  Semi-autonomous agents seem to have the right combination of technological and timing fit for blockchain runtimes. The trend is becoming widely accepted as one of the next waves in generative AI, and there are real challenges in terms of transparency, coordination, and security that seem well-suited for blockchains. Whether that integration materializes or not will require some clever technical adaptations in both technical movements. But the need is real; semi-autonomous agents could be the one trend that bridges generative AI and blockchains.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | RESEARCH,Jesus Rodriguez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/12/12/a-difficult-truth-the-unspoken-mismatch-of-web3-and-generative-ai,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/898c3be9af56dd711a31d6eceb716430d3d7de3f-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42391744,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfvze5,1702400498,Polygon to Offer Data Solution Celestia as Option for New Layer-2 Developers,"Celestia, a so-called data availability (DA) solution designed to provide a cheaper alternative for verifying data generated from blockchain transactions, announced Tuesday that it will become an option for blockchain builders using Polygon's software tools to spin up new layer-2 networks atop Ethereum.  The import is that Celestia will be included with Polygon’s customizable software stack, known as the Chain Development Kit (CDK), which is powered by zero-knowledge technology. So developers will be able to use the data availability solution when using Polygon's tech to design and set up their own layer-2 networks.  Read More: Celestia, Blockchain Data Solution, Sees TIA Token Surge as Polygon Plan Announced  According to a press release seen by CoinDesk, Celestia's DA solution will be available to developers in early 2024.  Celestia went live in October, and a primary business proposition for the network is that it can drastically reduce costs for layer-2 networks, since they won't have to be constantly paying fees to Ethereum to store and verify the data.  “This is the broadband moment for Web3,” said Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal in the press release. “The ability to launch a high-throughput ZK-powered Ethereum layer 2 as easily as deploying a smart contract will do for blockchain adoption what high-speed fiber did for Web2 applications.”  Ethereum's roadmap  Ethereum has its own roadmap for handling data, including an initial step known as ""proto-danksharding,"" but developers of the blockchain have been slow to realize the plan, and in the meantime several independent networks like Celestia, EigenLayer's EigenDA, Avail and even the rival layer-1 blockchain NEAR have sprung up to provide their own data-availability solutions.  Avail was initially incubated within Polygon. But in March, Polygon spun it out, writing in a press release that it wanted to align ""more closely with the roadmap of Ethereum.""  ""By releasing Avail, Polygon Labs becomes able to follow this principle more closely by shifting focus to Ethereum-native data availability efforts,"" according to a press release at the time. ""Ethereum-native data availability solutions have unique properties and represent interests of Ethereum, so Polygon Labs will support them more moving forward.”  Polygon still relies on Ethereum's data solution for its Polygon zkEVM network, and it might still eventually offer other data availability solutions besides Celestia, such as Avail, as an option, when they're ready.  According to a Polygon Labs spokesperson, ""Polygon CDK allows developers to build with zkEVM options, such as rollups and validiums. Developers building validiums using Polygon CDK will now have the option to use Celestia for data availability with other solutions potentially integrating with Polygon networks in the future.""  Avail, which is run by a Polygon co-founder, Anurag Arjun, recently launched a test network and is supposed to go live in 2024.

But the price of the cryptocurrency dropped significantly on Tuesday, reaching $41,800. Following Bitcoin’s December surge, investors chose to take profits, which led to this fall. There was a significant decline the night before, with Bitcoin momentarily falling as low as $40,300. Due to the decline, the top cryptocurrency in the world had almost a week’s worth of gains erased in only 20 minutes on Sunday night. According to statistics from TradingView, Bitcoin saw a dramatic 7% decline at approximately 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time, falling from above $43,200 to as low as $40,290. Bitcoin Liquidations And Stock Fluctuations Following months of stagnation in a limited trading range, Bitcoin has been steadily rising in recent weeks. The cryptocurrency has seen a notable change in mood and performance after previously experiencing market disinterest. Coinglass data indicates a flurry of positions liquidated in the 12 hours starting on Sunday evening, with upwards of $335 million in liquidations across cryptocurrencies, and roughly $300 million of that in long positions. The reason for the abrupt swing down was not immediately evident. In just Bitcoin alone, liquidations totaled over $89 million. Source: TradingView Stocks have fluctuated this week as investors prepare for a busy event schedule. Expectedly high volatility this week—the Federal Reserve’s most recent monetary policy decision is due on Wednesday, and important November inflation data is coming on Tuesday—is the cause of this anxiety. Related Reading: Hold Your Horses: Bitcoin Could Fall Back To Under $38,000, These Analysts Say When assessing the present rise in bitcoin, chart analysts all agree that a more significant dip in the cryptocurrency would be necessary before they would reevaluate how strong the rally is.

Rob Ginsberg from Wolfe Research agrees, pointing out that there is a lot of momentum in the continuing rising trend. According to the consensus of industry professionals, there is a general belief in the durability and longevity of Bitcoin’s upward trajectory. Still A Bright Road Ahead A number of favorable catalysts for the cryptocurrency is seen in the upcoming year, with the first being the possibility of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Investors anticipate a price spike in the months that follow the anticipated halving of Bitcoin in the spring of 2024.

The main driver of the surge has been expectations that large financial institutions will soon be able to purchase significant exposure to Bitcoin through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The market’s common expectation that the US Federal Reserve would start cutting interest rates in the middle of 2024 has added to the support for Bitcoin’s price climb.

People in the trading community are talking more about possible catalysts and causes that have contributed to Cardano’s recent market dynamics because of how unexpected its ascension is. Although there was early jubilation following Cardano’s recent jump to $0.65, it turned out to be fleeting. ADA quickly experienced a reversal, reflecting a more extensive and unanticipated decline in the cryptocurrency market. The quick and marked reversal from its high has sparked the current discussion over the sustainability of ADA’s growth and the future trajectory of its native token inside the blockchain sector.

Given the sudden and significant movement in the value of ADA, analysts and market participants should examine the circumstances that led to this development and consider the possible consequences for Cardano’s long-term sustainability. Related Reading: Helium Token Balloons To 85% For A Yearly High – What Drove The Price Up Similar tendencies to Ethereum, where liquidations on the latter exceeded $80 million during the overall market collapse, caused the pressure that stopped ADA’s growth. The abrupt change in ADA’s course is indicative of more general market circumstances. ADA market cap at $21.2 billion on the 24-hour chart: TradingView.com Due to the excitement surrounding the possible US approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF, Cardano’s recent gains seem to be the result of a resurgence of optimism in the cryptocurrency markets. Positive Outlook From The Experts Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem has grown as a result of this optimism, with Total Value Locked (TVL) recently reaching a record-breaking $420 million. Along with the token’s price increases, ADA trading volumes have also grown, surpassing $1.1 billion in the last day. Renowned cryptocurrency analyst Tyler Strejilevich, in the meantime, tweeted his bullish forecast, implying a spectacular rise for Cardano. #ADA is about to get a bullish weekly cross for the first time since JUNE 2020 The last time this happened it pumped 6,000% over the next 66 weeks#cardano pic.twitter.com/xQvvbf3b1O — Tyler Strejilevich (@TylerSCrypto) December 9, 2023 He noticed a bullish weekly cross on ADA’s chart, an occurrence not seen in more than three years, which sent the price of the stock skyrocketing by 6,000% in just 66 weeks, to an all-time high of $3.09 in 2020. His examination led him to believe that ADA’s future may follow past trends, particularly in light of the recent emergence of a bullish weekly cross on the asset’s chart. Should past events hold true, there is a chance that Cardano will drop below $33 in the next 66 weeks. The cryptocurrency community is buzzing after another well-known expert, Ali Martinez, published a positive Cardano (ADA) price prediction. Meanwhile, Everlodge, a recently launched DeFi initiative, revealed intentions to include state-of-the-art AI technology into its ecosystem. #Cardano is on track! ✅$ADA price movement is echoing its 2018-2020 trajectory, minus the COVID-19 downturn.

In time, future distributions will occur in STRK, the native governance token of the Starknet blockchain. Currently, 8% of the fees will go to builders of decentralized applications, or ""dApps,"" while the remaining 2% will go to Starknet core developers.  The announcement comes after the Starknet Foundation disclosed plans last week that there would eventually be a 1.8 billion STRK token airdrop, though a representative from Starkware clarified that the tokens from Devonomics are separate from the previous announcement.  “Since Day 1, devs have brought Starknet to life and their work is generating the network’s fees,” StarkWare co-founder and CEO Uri Kolodny said in a press release. “Allocating a portion of the fees back to dApp builders – provisionally set at 8% – will enable them to do more to make the network even bigger and bolder.”  Read more: Starknet Foundation to Allocate 1.8B STRK Tokens 'Soon'",POSITIVE,ETH | STRK,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | SPONSORED | STRK | AIRDROP,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/12/12/starkware-distributing-35m-fees-to-developers-in-devonomics-program,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8c0b8c8e5a36688b3e4bceff08dbbeb50658aa76-1367x769.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The International Court of Arbitration is one of the world's leading arbitration institutions and the ability to use its framework lends the DeFi space unprecedented credibility.  Q Protocol’s constitution lays down the rules of the system, which includes the resolution mechanism of the ICC.  Q Protocol, which provides blockchain governance as a service to Web3 and decentralized autonomous organizations, will use the rules laid out by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC)'s arbitration court to resolve disputes and enforce awards, Nicolas Biagosch, the protocol's co-initiator, told CoinDesk in an interview.  The protocol allows developers to build organizational constitutions that are enforced by smart contracts and include off-chain avenues for resolving disputes the code can't deal with. Q Protocol’s own constitution lays down the rules of the system, which includes resorting to the 100-year-old International Court of Arbitration.  Historically, dispute resolution has been a problem in DeFi. One example: A clash between Aragon Foundation, the Swiss entity that oversaw Aragon, and a group of activist investors who took interest in the project’s ANT token and multimillion-dollar treasury, led to the foundation winding down and handing its $155 million in assets to token holders.  “We would have had a solution to the Aragon dispute,” Biagosch said.  The ICC rules are often used by entities as a way to conduct private arbitration because it tends to be quicker than nation-state-based jurisdictions.  “We are in a position to administer matters submitted to us unless doing so would contravene the legal framework within which ICC operates,” Alexander G. Fessas, secretary general of the International Court of Arbitration, told CoinDesk in an interview. “I can confirm that the ICC International Court of Arbitration has already administered blockchain-related disputes.”  Despite not being a first, the fact that disputes within the space of decentralized finance (DeFi) can use the framework offered by ICC, the world's leading arbitral institution for resolution lends the space unprecedented credibility.  “Our mission is to ensure access to justice and the rule of law and our objective is to assist parties in resolving their disputes.” Fessas said. “It is good to see businesses in emerging industries like blockchain choose reputable institutional arbitration, and we expect to see more of this moving forward, particularly in specialized technologies.”  “The participants in the Q ecosystem (13 projects have signed on to use the services) are parties to the private contract that is the Q Constitution,” Biagosch said. “They have agreed therein that the ICC Court of Arbitration shall, based on the Q Constitution and through its rules of procedure, be the only mechanism to resolve disputes, instead of and alternative to nation-state court systems.”  Biagosch also said that the ICC will always reserve the right, based on its rules, to not hear the case. “One cannot force it into dispute resolution.”  Apart from dispute resolution through the ICC, decentralized discretionary decision-making and decentralized enforcement of rules beyond code-is-law are other aspects of Q Protocol’s services. The Q Protocol mainnet started operations in March 2022. In addition to the projects signed on to use the governance services, as many as 123 DAOs have built their organization on Q, which is another service available on the platform.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Amitoj Singh,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/12/12/q-protocol-to-apply-international-court-of-arbitration-rules-to-defi-disputes-in-a-sign-of-growing-industry-maturity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4fb045c30786ffa85d3b1ea773577f0e0a0d1f82-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

BlackRock recently made it so authorized participants – a vital part of the ETF ecosystem – will be able to create new fund shares with cash, rather than only with cryptocurrency.  As highly regulated U.S. banks are unable to hold bitcoin themselves, this set-up would enable the likes of JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs – firms with some of the largest balance sheets in the world – to act as APs to BlackRock's ETF. (Whether they want to is another matter.)  The cash APs use in this process can then be exchanged into bitcoin by an intermediary and warehoused by the ETF's custody provider, as per a memo filing relating to a Nov. 28 meeting involving the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, BlackRock and Nasdaq.  Optimism has grown that spot bitcoin ETFs will soon be approved by the SEC, which would be a game-changer for the digital assets industry if it lures in a flood of money from retail investors. A commonly held view up until now was that APs would be large market-making firms with experience in crypto, such as Jane Street, Jump Trading and Virtu – not banks. But the change means banks could get a cut of the action, and broaden the ranks of liquidity providers.  ""If the SEC accepts this revised, dual model of create and redeem with cash and physical, that means the liquidity that supports the ETF shares when they trade would be increased, because obviously, you have more potential APs as part of the process,"" CF Benchmarks CEO Sui Chung said in an interview. (CF Benchmarks is the Kraken-owned benchmarks administrator for several existing spot bitcoin ETF applications, including BlackRock's.)

Project Diamond, developed by Coinbase Asset Management, combines Coinbase Prime’s custody service, the exchange’s Web3 crypto wallet, Circle’s USDC stablecoin and layer-2 network Base to create a capital marketplace.  The platform has received in-principle approval from the Financial Services Regulated Activity (FSRA) of Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) and will enter the agency’s RegLab sandbox, the company said. It already issued and distributed its first debt instrument, a short-term discount note denominated in USDC stablecoin, on Base as a demonstration to regulators in Abu Dhabi.  The platform is available to registered institutional users outside the U.S.  Coinbase's release arrived at a time when there's a fierce competition with global banks and crypto-native companies to bring more traditional financial assets such as bonds and credit onto blockchain rails.

He highlighted a critical support level for the crypto token and also reasserted his bullish prediction for XRP when the bull run returns. XRP Could Rise To $2 From This Support Level In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Egrag mentioned that XRP could rise to as high as $2 once it is able to hit the support level of $1.2. He shared an accompanying chart to drive home his point. From the chart, he noted that it was “intriguing” that XRP hasn’t managed to close a monthly candle above $1.2 yet. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price In Turmoil: Major Events That Could Affect Price This Week Source: X He further mentioned that so far, XRP has body candles, but a full-body candle hasn’t materialized. Despite that, the crypto analyst is still bullish on the future trajectory of XRP. He confidently said that XRP will hit $2 once XRP “finally achieves a monthly candle close with a full body above $1.2.” Considering that many seem to be losing hope in XRP’s potential, Egrag suggested that this move will provide renewed hope as he is convinced that it will trigger a “massive FOMO.” Meanwhile, those who have continued to remain steadfast will be hoping that Egrag’s prediction comes true as they believe that XRP is long overdue for a significant rally. Egrag had previously mentioned that XRP hitting $27 is a “plausible target,” considering that XRP saw a parabolic move back in 2017, with the token seeing a 61,000% gain in 280 days. He once again reasserted his bullish stance as he stated that he still has his sight set on the $27 mark. Token price fluctuates | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com XRP Price Retesting Trendline Crypto analyst JD also recently shared an outlook of XRP on the charts. He mentioned in an X post that XRP broke out of the multi-year trendline on the Non-Logarithmic Scale. Following that, XRP is currently retesting the trendline. Related Reading: Why Is Ethereum Price Down To $2,200 Today? As to what the future holds for XRP, he noted that a bounce-off on the weekly close is bullish, as that could signify a breakout or retest. However, a break below the trendline could be a false breakout. Source: X Meanwhile, another analyst, Crytoes, recently noted that the bears are still in control when it comes to the XRP market. He made this statement following XRP’s daily close below the 21MA (Moving Average). At the time of writing, XRP is trading at around $0.62, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by market volume, has seen its spot market share gradually decline over the year as the company faced an array of charges from regulators that eventually claimed its founder and CEO, Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao. According to numbers provided by CCData, Binance's market share so far in December was just 30.1% versus 55% at the start of the year. From January to September, the exchange’s monthly spot volumes declined by over 70% to $114 billion. CCData notes that the trading volumes have been increasing since September even as its market share continues to slide.  El Salvador’s long-planned Bitcoin bonds have inched closer to reality after apparently receiving regulatory approval for an early 2024 issuance, the country’s Bitcoin-focused office posted on Tuesday. The bonds are set to be offered on Bitfinex Securities, a regulated division of crypto exchange Bitfinex. “The Volcano Bond has just received regulatory approval from the Digital Assets Commission (CNAD),” El Salvador’s National Bitcoin Office posted from its account on X. “We anticipate the bond will be issued during the first quarter of 2024.”  Cathie Wood's ARK Invest sold around $12.85 million worth of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares from its Next Generation Internet (ARKW) exchange-traded fund (ETF) on Monday, the biggest sale in more than a year. The offload of 395,945 GBTC shares from ARKW leaves the fund with about $112.7 million worth of GBTC, a weighting of 6.95%. ARK aims for no individual holding in its ETFs to exceed a 10% weighting of the fund's total market value. Digital asset manager Grayscale's bitcoin (BTC) investment vehicle dropped 8.6% to $32.46 on Monday, reflecting the 5.8% decline in the value of the largest cryptocurrency by market value.  Chart of the Day  Decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume has picked up in the last month.  DEX volumes have always been significantly lower than volumes on centralized exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance etc, but the recent crypto rally has caused an increase in activity.  DEX monthly trade volume rose to $29 billion in November, recovering from a multiyear low hit in September.

The filing disputed the amount claimed and also said there are no other sources of cash. Unless a judge rejects the Internal Revenue Service's demand, the victims of the FTX fraud will not get any meaningful recovery. The case is scheduled to be heard later Tuesday.  ""This Alice in Wonderland argument has no support in the law,"" the filing said. ""There is simply no basis to support the IRS’s meritless claims that the Debtors owe tax in an amount that is orders of magnitude greater than any income the Debtors ever earned and that would effectively prevent most of FTX’s creditors – themselves victims of fraud – from obtaining any meaningful recovery.""  In its objection to the Debtors' proposed plan to estimate IRS claims last week, the U.S. did say it is ""not looking for windfall, only to determine the correct amount of the tax liabilities.""  FTX filed for bankruptcy in November last year after a chain of events triggered by a CoinDesk report that raised questions about its finances. On Nov. 2, 2023, a jury found FTX founder Bankman-Fried guilty of seven counts of fraud and conspiracy tied to the exchange's operation. His sentencing is expected in February 2024.  FTX didn't dispute that the Court ""can and should determine the amount (if any) owed by the Debtors to the IRS"" but that the government's proposal for the determination process “would unduly delay the administration of the case.”  Read More: U.S. Lawmakers Urge Treasury to Revise Proposed Crypto Tax Rules",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Amitoj Singh,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/12/12/ftx-disputes-irss-alice-in-wonderland-tax-claim,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0228f48f345481c6eb51c437e52f21d1270dbcbc-4032x2268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It should easily outperform the S&P 500. Other altcoins have been rallying and ETH should follow. It has the biggest and most impressive DeFi and Web3 ecosystem in crypto so the underperformance seems misplaced. Ethereum's proof-of-stake consensus is centralizing and fragile. This is okay for most cases, but people need to understand what they are getting and be intellectually honest. A good mental model for Ethereum is that the blockchain is the most sophisticated casino ever created. ETH has great value for that reason, but there are caveats, such as cyclicality. ETH probably will not outperform BTC over a 10-year timeframe. I talk about why over here as well. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has been rallying this year. Anyone who followed my Bitcoin buy ratings would have made quite a bit of money and outperformed most other assets. Many are wondering where this rally leaves the altcoins. This article is about the role of Ethereum (ETH-USD) within this backdrop. Here’s the bottom line up front: Do not be surprised if ETH outperforms BTC over the next 6 months. ETH has been lagging BTC for a while and there seems to be some expectation that conditions will change. This is not something I am personally betting on. When I take short-term bets, I usually use derivatives. When it is a long-term bet, I usually stick with the spot asset. I have a large BTC allocation and 0 ETH, since I expect ETH to significantly underperform BTC over the next 5-10 years. ETH is a buy if you are looking to beat the S&P 500 and it is a hold if you are looking to beat BTC in the next few months. Let’s reason through all this. My last article about ETH talked about how it is poised to benefit from AI. The thesis is playing out because there are quite a lot of Web3 AI projects that have received funding this year. The integrations they make with the Ethereum public blockchain will be interesting to watch for 2024. In that article, I also provided a heavy breakdown of ETH’s tokenomics. For those who don’t know, tokenomics is basically the fundamentals of any digital asset. This is why you shouldn’t trust the people who only use technical analysis on crypto without a fundamental overlay. Whenever I read a crypto article, I scroll through to see if there is any talk at all about supply schedule, token burn, fees-based yield, value accrual, multiples (yes, most crypto have multiples just like stocks!), revenues, earnings, cost structure, etc. I also look for market indicators like open interest, funding rates, put/call skews, etc. I usually see none of this. What I do see are lots of lines on charts. I usually just exit the page at that point. I too can draw lines, so there isn’t much to learn over there. ETH’s tokenomics is quite complex but I had determined that it was a fluid asset which can seamlessly switch between money, commodity, and security. Something like it has never really existed before. I really encourage you to check out the article , skip the parts about AI, and just read the tokenomics section which is called “ETH Valuation.” Ah yes - you can do an actual valuation as you would a stock! If you wanted to see lines on charts, I’m afraid you’d have to go elsewhere. Centralization and Fragility Here’s what I didn’t mention in that article, mainly because it wasn’t important in the context of AI. You may notice that ETH has strong centralizing tendencies. Everyone who holds it is incentivized to stake ETH because that is how they can benefit from all three sources of ETH cash flows: the base fee gas burn, the issuance, and the priority fees. Unstaked ETH earns only the gas burn, but the gas burn is mostly cancelled out by the issuance of new ETH to ETH stakers. ETH stakers basically earn more and more at the expense of non-stakers. As mentioned in the article: Staking ETH makes your ETH position resemble an equity position – you benefit from both the dividend (from the gas that is distributed to stakers) and the buybacks (from the gas that is burned). Technically, stakers also benefit from a Cantillon effect where they get newly issued ETH from the block reward. Think of this as issuing shares exclusively to shareholders who are promising not to sell their shares. Those shareholders promising not to sell are clearly getting a larger and larger portion of the company because they receive exclusive share issuance. Over time, the bigger you are, the exponentially larger your portion of ETH will become. This is a feature of proof-of-stake consensus. This centralization is okay for most cases, but it is fragile. It would never survive an attack by a nation state actor, in which the majority of the stakers are in the jurisdiction of the attacking nation state. If the US decided to crack down on major ETH holders, that would be the end for Ethereum. Proof-of-work is different and much more antifragile. Just look at China’s attack on Bitcoin in 2021, back when most of Bitcoin’s hashrate was in China. Global Hashrate Shares (Statista) The network never got interrupted. The hashrate simply left China and went to friendlier jurisdictions. And the network’s total hashrate is now way higher than it was back in 2021. Antifragile. The main difference in fragility comes from the indisputable fact that BTC ownership does not mean even a tiny bit of control over the Bitcoin network, while ETH ownership does mean some control over the Ethereum network . It’s a difference you could never know if you just drew lines on a chart. And this difference is exactly why I don’t see ETH or any proof-of-stake coin outperforming BTC in the next 10 years. Trading around for PNL was never the point of crypto. Yield farming on liquidity pools was never the point of crypto. Blockchains were never the point of crypto. The point of crypto from the beginning was to offer an alternative to the current fiat system – an unstoppable alternative, unstoppable because of superior economic incentives. Ethereum is not unstoppable. A government can just print money, buy ETH, and capture the network. It doesn’t even have to use any force. Proof-of-stake is too fragile to be unstoppable. It is therefore another version of the current fiat system, not necessarily because it wants to be or was intended to be, but because it will be forced to be. Proof-of-work, embodied by Bitcoin, is unstoppable. It doesn’t have the centralizing tendencies that are built into proof-of-stake. It is truly decentralized. Do you think a government can be strong enough to break down a decentralized thing? Why don’t you ask the US government how well that has been going in the failed War on Terror? 20 years and $2.3 trillion wasted chasing down a decentralized group of people who don’t even have WiFi all the time! Why don’t you look at how Vietnam went? The winner of both World Wars couldn’t do anything to those decentralized bands of guerilla fighters. It ended up defaulting on the gold standard and then pulling out of Vietnam a few years after. How about trying to trace stuff on Tor, a decentralized software which anyone can run? Any progress on that? I am trying to make this point very clear because this is where people get crypto wrong. I know because I was one of those people. Crypto as an investment started as a bet against the current system. All the smart money knows this or is starting to wake up to this fact. This bet isn’t crowded yet because the current system is still strong and crypto has a ton of naysayers and, frankly, things are okay for now. That said, a bet against the current system makes rational sense because cracks are starting to show. The most powerful expression of that bet is BTC (self-custodied in a cold wallet, not a Bitcoin ETF) because it is the most antifragile and you need something highly antifragile to make a bet like this. If your crypto is not a bet against the current system, then you are betting on the utility of crypto for stuff like speculation, trading, digital financial services for the unbanked, Web3, etc. This is also very useful. Casinos are an enormous business and crypto is the most innovative and efficient version of casinos ever created. There is a huge population of unbanked around the world. There is money to be made here and anyone who denies it hasn’t looked at the data. Here’s the thing: the Bitcoin ecosystem can support this stuff too, but most Bitcoiners tend to be conservative folks who stay away from speculation and trading, so there isn’t a great product market fit. Let’s go back to ETH. ETH is no good for the first bet. It’s too fragile. That said, Ethereum has made great strides in the second bet. Most of the value accrual of decentralized applications is happening on Ethereum. These apps are of course for DeFi, which is almost all gambling, albeit the most sophisticated and accessible form of gambling ever conceived by Man. Some of the apps are for Web3, but this too is largely gambling because they tend to build over DeFi. Some apps are on L2s exclusively. Even so, their value still accrues towards ETH because Ethereum serves as the base layer for all the major L2s. This makes ETH a great investment within the current system. ETH is the base layer of the most sophisticated casino ever created. This casino can serve millions of people, no matter where they are. Moreover, anyone can come along and build more slot machines and games for this casino, which makes the whole thing more engaging for the customers. How’s that for some intrinsic value? More projects will continue to build on top of it, which will mean more utility for ETH and more profits for ETH investors and (especially) ETH stakers. As long as the Ethereum ecosystem maintains a good pace of innovation, ETH should continue to outperform the S&P 500. In the short term, we have seen that altcoins can outperform BTC during BTC bull markets, essentially as a high beta version of BTC. I would not be surprised if this scenario plays out in the next 6 months. It has happened before, and it is likely to happen again. I am not one to say, “this time is different.” Market Analysis Let’s now look at charts. Remember, charts aren’t useless, they are just used too much in most crypto analysis. Occasionally a chart can say something interesting about where things are going. Below is the chart of ETH priced in BTC. ETH/BTC (Google) The price is about to hit a 2-year low. Last time it was there, it rallied sharply. After the Merge (which transitioned ETH to proof-of-stake) near the end of 2022, ETH has been down about 30% in BTC terms. There’re a few ways we can look at this. The first thing is that the market is pricing in the tradeoffs of proof-of-stake and has punished ETH ever since the Merge. The second is that all the talk about a Bitcoin Spot ETF and institutional adoption has been very unilaterally favorable for BTC throughout 2023. There is a strong case to be made that some kind of mean reversion is possible, which means that ETH would outperform BTC. Altcoins have been rallying. Look at Solana (SOL-USD) or Avalanche (AVAX-USD), alternative smart contract chains which have seriously outperformed in the last 2 months. These were marketed as “ETH-killers,” blockchains which could unseat Ethereum as the primary smart contract blockchain. In the charts below, the gold line is the price in BTC and the blue line is the price in dollars. AVAX (CoinGecko) SOL (CoinGecko) Interestingly, the narrative here is overwhelmingly strong compared to the actual fundamentals. Usage in both these chains are quite low compared to usage of the Ethereum ecosystem. Yet, we see SOL and AVAX easily outperforming BTC in the last 2 months. Note that both Solana and Avalanche are proof-of-stake blockchains like Ethereum. I interpret this mostly as extremely high beta, and because both had been either muted or rather oversold compared to BTC’s rally for much of 2023, and that their smaller size gives them a small cap premium. It may only be a matter of time before ETH follows these altcoins into some level of outperformance over BTC. The ETH/BTC chart shown earlier indicates that such outperformance is yet to materialize this year. Quick Comps If we return to the “bets” mentioned earlier, BTC is clearly the bet against the current system. That leaves the rest of crypto to fight out relative positions in the other bet – the bet to be an avenue for speculation, DeFi, Web3, etc. Amongst all non-BTC crypto, I like the fundamentals of ETH the best. It has the biggest developer network and the most infrastructure to build on top of. Also, there isn’t a great need for alternative L1s when Ethereum’s ecosystem of L2s is already offering very high throughput. For example, Solana is said to be one of the fastest blockchains. However, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon – all Ethereum L2s – have a similar level of speed. Plus, a lot of the oft-repeated throughput metrics are also misleading . Moreover, the Ethereum L2s actually have users on them. Look at these metrics from Token Terminal. Arbitrum generates about as much revenue and fees as Solana and Avalanche combined. That should tell you a lot – the fact that one second-layer of Ethereum is generating more value than these other two “ETH Killers” combined. Solana (Token Terminal) Avalanche (Token Terminal) Arbitrum (Token Terminal) So, if the altcoins will rally then ETH should follow eventually. Do not be surprised if ETH outperforms BTC in the next few months. Why Won’t The House Outperform Bitcoin in the Long Run? The only loose end now is to talk through why I don’t think ETH will outperform BTC in the long run. The two blockchains serve different goals. Bitcoin is addressing a dire need of humanity – the need for digital savings which cannot be debased, confiscated, or frozen (Bitcoin is a lot more than that, but this article is about ETH). That is the bet against the current system, because the defining feature of the fiat system is that savings are debased, confiscated, and frozen by decree. It’s defining because it is in plain sight: fiat means “decree.” You have savings not only because you labored, but because the State declared it so. In your part of the world, the State might be benign so there’s not much of a problem. In other parts of the world, the State can be more… overbearing. Ethereum addresses a lesser need. Regardless of how it started off, ETH is now mostly the equity security and Poker chips of the most advanced casino in the world. So, ETH has value. It probably has more upside than the S&P 500 because everything built on Ethereum helps accrue value to ETH. And a lot of things will continue to be built on Ethereum. It is an old observation that all crypto cycles are led by Bitcoin. When BTC rallies, more interest and money flow into the casinos. That is the tide that lifts the boats. There is more to this. ETH is clearly very security-like and this has material impact on its ability to see institutional inflows. For instance, a classification as an unregulated security will make things very difficult going forward. Meanwhile, BTC is clearly not a security and the regulations around it are mostly around getting custodians to comply with KYC and AML regulations. It is entirely a different struggle. We can see the institutional recognition happening for BTC but not for ETH or any other crypto. Just check out the first page this Fidelity’s report on digital assets. You don’t actually have to read the report to see what I am getting at. Fidelity Report (Fidelity) Regulatory clarity is coming to crypto eventually, but when it does, ETH investors may be in for a surprise. The reality is that proof-of-stake creates assets that are a lot like shares. I don’t see a way to get around that. They passively pay dividends which come from fees and they offer control over the chain. And if investors start to treat these assets as stocks, some repricing needs to happen because the multiples are simply too high. We also don’t know how much of the speculation going on in crypto is due to the novelty of crypto. I imagine some of it is due to novelty and hype. Volumes tend to drop off during bear markets, so Ethereum’s utility is also quite cyclical. Bull markets are when the gambling utility becomes more important. Seeing that we are heading into a bull market, this is a tailwind for ETH in the short term. Takeaways Your benchmark ultimately determines what you should do with ETH. ETH could outperform BTC in the next 6 months as the crypto bull market heats up more and altcoins become high beta plays. It is a speculative buy or a hold if you are seeking short-term outperformance over BTC. In the long run, BTC should outperform nearly everything. If you are trying to beat SPY, ETH should do the job. There are too many tailwinds now and ETH is the only big crypto that seems to be lagging recently. That’s an easy buy.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,ALTCOIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4657397-ethereum-has-upside?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/21314728.jpeg

This week has witnessed bull action for the Solana-based Helium Network’s HNT coin, which has seen a 70% weekly rise to $4.86. Based on the most recent data, HNT, which has a market cap of about $700 million and an amazing $10 billion in trading volume as of press time, quietly touched a yearly high of $5.12 over the weekend after seeing a commanding 85% price spike in only seven days. Related Reading: Hold Your Horses: Bitcoin Could Fall Back To Under $38,000, These Analysts Say Helium Climbs To Yearly High HNT price action today. Source: Coingecko Buyers demonstrated an upswing and were able to keep the price above both EMAs. The 200-day EMA, which shows strength in the most recent bull run, is about to cross paths with the 50-day EMA for helium. In the event that the crossing takes place, prices may reach new swing highs. The price of helium has been more volatile this week due to a divergence in the Bollinger Bands. Indicating bull domination throughout the course of the week on the price of helium, HNT’s relative strength indicator is above its average line in the overbought area. HNT price prediction for December. Source: Coincodex. HNT was up from $2.73 to $5.78 in the first week of December, signifying a 70% increase in price. Just this past month, the token has increased by over 190%. The most recent estimate for the price of Helium is that it may reach $5.75 this month, according to Coincodex. For a network that has primarily dealt with bad press regarding its product and the transition from its proprietary blockchain to Solana, this price performance marks a turnaround. HNTUSD trading at $5.31 today. Chart: TradingView.com HNT Among Top Crypto Performers In the cryptocurrency market, Helium, a decentralized network that launched in 2019, has made significant progress. It is now among the best performers. Concurrent with this price increase is Solana (SOL), which has risen by over 50% over the past 30 days. On November 12, 2021, HNT reached its highest point at $55.15. On the other hand, it fell to an all-time low of $0.200 on May 29, 2020. Related Reading: Avalanche Rules Top 10 Ranking With 61% Weekly Gain – Here’s The Scoop The lowest recorded price since the all-time high was $1.16, and the highest was $5.75. The Fear & Greed Index shows a score of 72 (Greed), and the current consensus for Helium’s price prediction is positive. Meanwhile, analysts say the $20 monthly phone plan from Helium Mobile, which gives customers unlimited data, voice, and text, is mostly the impetus for HNT’s price increase. According to a recent survey, the average American spends about $150 a month on phone plans alone. Helium’s newest connectivity service is expected to provide a more affordable option than traditional service providers.

The company is expanding its capacity in Texas to take advantage of low-cost renewable energy. Iris Energy's profitability projections are promising due to the increase in Bitcoin price, making it a compelling investment in Bitcoin mining. Iris Energy Limited ( IREN ) specializes in sustainable energy for Bitcoin mining. With facilities in British Columbia, Canada, and Childress County, Texas, IREN is expanding its capacity, particularly in Childress, Texas, to take advantage of low-cost renewable energy. Its commitment to environmental sustainability is worth highlighting. The profitability projections are optimistic due to the increase in Bitcoin price. On the other hand, IREN is moving to AI cloud services to increase its portfolio in the technological innovation field. However, its main focus remains Bitcoin mining. In my valuation analysis, IREN is effectively a leveraged bet on Bitcoin’s price, being viable at a post-halving price of $50,000 or higher. This optionality and scale make IREN a compelling speculative investment in Bitcoin mining. A Mining Venture: Business Overview Iris Energy Limited specializes in Bitcoin data mining centers. IREN was founded in 2018 and IPOed in November 2021. It is headquartered in Sydney, Australia. The company operates under the principle of prioritizing using renewable energy sources. IREN owns and operates next-generation data centers powered by 100% renewable energy, generating revenues from its hashing power that awards IREN Bitcoin, which in turn sells and receives its revenues. Currently, IREN has four facilities : three in British Columbia, Canada: Canal Flats with 30 megawatts, Mackenzie with 80 megawatts, and Prince George with 50 megawatts; and one in Childress County, Texas, USA, with 20 megawatts for initial capacity. This last site is in the West Texas Load Zone with access to low-cost renewable energy, which is beneficial as a mining operation. Also, IREN is expanding with an additional 80 megawatts of energy, and the region has 37 gigawatts of renewable energy (wind and solar farms) with only around 18.5 gigawatts of transmission line capacity. The periods of oversupply lead to reduced energy costs, making it an ideal region for IREN’s business model, as power costs are likely to remain within a reasonable range. IREN’s facilities are optimized for Bitcoin mining. The company plans to nearly double its Bitcoin mining capacity by Q2 2024, increasing from 5.6 EH/s (exa hashes per second) to about 10 EH/s. To increase profitability, IREN wants to reduce its electricity cost by moving more of its operations to Childress, Texas. The company is building a new 1,400 megawatt data center in Childress, Texas, expected to be in service in late 2026. On November 30, to improve efficiency, IREN acquired 1.4 EH/s of Bitmain S21 miners, a mining rig model, to increase its mining capacity. IREN operates data centers using 180 megawatts, with 80 megawatts under construction and 500 megawatts of additional power available. Source: Iris Energy Investor Update (November 2023). The company plans to expand to Cloud services with ongoing customer and financing negotiations, including generative AI firms, aggregators, and start-ups. In August 2023, IREN acquired 248 NVIDIA H100 GPUs to exploit growth opportunities, such as the increasing demand for power-dense computing with generative AI. In September, IREN reported the prospectus to sell ordinary shares, debt securities, warrants, subscription rights, purchase contracts, and units to raise $500 million. Further, IRES partnered with the AI software provider WEKA to obtain storage and data management for generative AI in October. Following its vision, IREN aims to help build a sustainable future with green energy data centers, offering local employment and supporting local communities. Projections in Bitcoin Mining for IREN As you might expect, IREN’s financials are related to the Bitcoin price. The financial projection computing profitability of the mining operation under different circumstances can be estimated with a Capex of approximately $31 million. The annual profits for the mining operation under different Bitcoin price scenarios from $25,000, $35,000, $50,000, and $100,000, with a hash rate of 1.1 EH/s, the hypothetical profits under these circumstances are estimated to be $16, $24, $36, and $75 million for the respective Bitcoin prices, before the halving. After the halving that occurs every four years, the hypothetical profits decrease when the reward for mining Bitcoin is cut in half. However, we could assume a 20% reduction in the global hash rate, leading to less mining competition. The estimated annual profits post-halving are $9, $14, $21, and $46 million for the respective Bitcoin prices. On December 6, IREN announced that it mined 369 Bitcoins in November. In October, IREN mined 376 Bitcoins. However, the mining revenue for the month was $13.7 million compared to $11.2 million in October due to the increase in the Bitcoin price. The price of Bitcoin is bouncing due to the confidence that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will approve an exchange-traded fund [ETF] to allow investing in Bitcoin in open crypto markets connected to traditional bank institutions. Also, the Federal Reserve may reduce interest rates. Both of these dynamics could theoretically become tailwinds for the price of Bitcoin, further propelling IREN’s mining revenues. Source: Iris Energy Investor Update (November 2023). A Leveraged Bet on Bitcoin: Valuation Analysis From a valuation perspective, the equation comes down to understanding the electricity costs of mining Bitcoin and the revenue IREN makes from selling that Bitcoin. Some miners sometimes try to time the market by holding inventory and attempting to unload it when prices increase, locking in additional profits over traditional miners. However, that involves price risk beyond our valuation assessment and is likely irrelevant to IREN’s situation. Source: IREN’s November 21, 2023 form 6-K. In the image above, you can see that IREN’s mining operation remained relatively stable in hashing terms. The company generated approximately the same computing power over these three months. July, August, and September showed 5,562 PH/s, 5,493 PH/s, and 5,554 PH/s, respectively. However, electricity costs, network hashing rate, and Bitcoin prices fluctuated, which is how IREN’s bottom line fluctuated. This means that IREN’s fundamentals are inextricably linked to Bitcoin’s price action, a risk layer investors must consider. Nevertheless, using the table above, I estimate that the revenue per Bitcoin for July, August, and September was $30,023.64, $28,048.78, and $26,410.26, respectively. These figures are remarkably close to the average monthly price of those corresponding months, indicating that IREN sells its Bitcoin relatively as soon as it mines it, locking in ongoing market prices. Furthermore, using a 30-DMA on the price of Bitcoin, I derive that IREN’s revenue per Bitcoin for October and November is likely around $30,000 and $36,600, respectively. This is a notable increase, though it’s worth considering that the hash rate required to mine Bitcoin has also increased, likely reducing the mining output. Overall, the key metric is IREN’s profit per Bitcoin, which for July, August, and September was $14,420.33, $17,560.98, and $12,564.11, respectively. However, note that this “profit per Bitcoin” metric is more representative of IREN’s overall gross profits, not net income because it excludes other operating expenses. Source: IREN’s November 21, 2023 form 6-K. We can use IREN’s most recent Net CAPEX and Operating Expense figures to estimate the current annual run rate. These figures were $17.8 million and $28.0 million, respectively. If we combine and annualize these figures, we get a run rate of $183.2 million at the current 5.6 EH/s operating scale. In my view, this serves as a breakeven reference point for IREN. The remaining expenses would be interest payments and taxes, so we’d have an adjusted EBIT number. Using the figures from the table above, the pre-halving gross profits at a $35,000 Bitcoin are $24 million per 1.1 EH/s. Thus, the yearly revenues would be $134.4 million, which is still below the breakeven I estimated. However, if Bitcoin traded at $50,000, the revenues would increase to $201.6 million, giving IREN an adjusted EBIT figure of $18.4 million. This looks cheap at IREN’s current enterprise value of $323.02 million, implying an EV/EBIT ratio of 17.55, below the sector’s median TTM EV/EBIT ratio of 20.25. I want to highlight that the previous valuation assessment doesn’t factor in IREN’s new planned expansion, which should improve its mining efficiency and grow its scale to 10 EH/s by 2024. Ostensibly, this would only underscore its undervalued profile even further. Moreover, if the Bitcoin price continues to increase, it will significantly boost IREN’s results. Source: IREN’s November 21, 2023 form 6-K. Investment Thesis Risks However, IREN’s new breakeven price with its added EH/s capacity is difficult to estimate as several variables are at play, notably electricity costs, Bitcoin’s hashing rate, and Bitcoin’s price. It would be best to have an outlook on these three variables to estimate IREN’s fair value. Moreover, by 2024, these variables will likely be substantially different, further complicating a long-term assessment of the company. Nevertheless, electricity costs will likely keep rising following its current manageable trend. On the other hand, Bitcoin’s hashing rate has been essentially increasing monotonically since its inception, so I expect that trend to remain. Higher hashing rates decrease the number of Bitcoin mined, typically an ongoing headwind. Lastly, the price of Bitcoin is anyone’s guess. However, my take is that if the price of Bitcoin breaks through $50,000 and sustains that price while IREN’s capacity expands, then IREN’s pre-halving gross profits jump up to $36 million per 1.1 EH/s. However, by then, the halving likely occurred already, which means the yearly revenue would be $21 million per 1.1 EH/s or $190.91 million yearly. So, IREN's post-halving valuation wouldn't make sense unless Bitcoin’s price increases to $50,000 or above, and that’s not guaranteed. IREN has bounced alongside the Bitcoin price. (TradingView.) Conclusion Overall, IREN is undoubtedly a Bitcoin bet. This is not a bad thing, but it does mean you require an outlook on Bitcoin’s price over the long run. Moreover, the upcoming 2024 halving will change the economics of IREN’s business. Historically, halvings have been associated with price increases that make mining viable again. However, this is not a guarantee, which makes it an embedded risk in IREN’s investment thesis. Nevertheless, I believe it’s relatively reasonable to assume that as cryptocurrencies continue to grow, the demand for Bitcoin will follow. Thus, over time, I foresee a rising Bitcoin price, and at IREN’s planned expansion, prices above $50,000 start to make IREN a compelling investment alternative. Moreover, IREN is akin to a leveraged play on Bitcoin as further price increases quickly provide substantial upside to shareholders. Thus, I think, on balance, IREN stock is a good speculative “bet” on the crypto mining sector.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4657418-iris-energy-leveraged-bet-on-renewable-bitcoin-mining?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/21312021.jpeg

APLD's financial performance showed an increase in revenue, driven by hosting crypto-mining operations, but the company faces negative reports about its business model and a class action lawsuit. Despite the challenges, APLD's stock has increased, likely due to the growth of Bitcoin, and its current market cap appears undervalued, making it a compelling investment in the sector. Applied Digital Corporation ( APLD ), in Q1 2024, has expanded its facilities for hosting and AI cloud services. APLD changed its name from Applied Blockchain, Inc. to reflect the transformation from cryptocurrency mining rigs into a data center and AI cloud service provider. The company's financial performance showed an increase in revenue, and it plans to add 300 megawatts to its capacity within the next 24 months. A shadow in its growth is the negative reports about its business model and governance and the class action lawsuit started by some shareholders who consider themselves misled and harmed by the company. Despite these hurdles, APLD's stock has increased, likely pushed by Bitcoin’s ( BTC-USD ) price growth. In my valuation analysis, I conclude that APLD’s current market cap appears undervalued, making it a compelling investment in the sector. A Crypto Play: Business Overview Applied Digital Corporation designs, builds, and operates digital infrastructure for High-Performance Computing [HPC] applications, Cloud Services, and data center hosting in North America. The company was founded in 2021, with an IPO in April 2022, and its headquarters are in Dallas, Texas, United States. In November 2022, the company changed its name from Applied Blockchain, Inc. to Applied Digital Corporation because even when APLD continued to be a supplier of cryptocurrency mining servers, the company also provided other high-performance computing [HPC]. The ticker symbol remained unchanged. Nevertheless, as of the latest quarterly information, APLD remains mostly a crypto-related business, with most revenues from hosting crypto-mining operations. APLD has two main business segments: data center and artificial intelligence cloud services, under serving area interface [SAI] Computing. APLD aims to satisfy a growing demand for low-cost digital infrastructure. APLD has three hosting facilities in the data center segment: a Jamestown data center, an Ellendale facility in North Dakota, and a Garden City data center for 500 megawatts. Also, APLD still operates as hosting for blockchain. The company has expanded in the AI cloud services by activating GPU clusters, machine learning, and natural language processing for its clients. Source: Jamestown facility, Contributed / Applied Digital Corp. APLD's Revenue Growth Amid Legal Scrutiny In the APLD’s earnings call for the fiscal first quarter of 2024, CEO Wes Cummins stated that APLD is expanding its blockchain servers with a total hosting capacity of 280 megawatts across the North Dakota facilities. For Q1 2024, the revenue was $36.3 million, a rise compared to the same period last year, with a revenue of $6.9 million. The net loss was $9.6 million. The company has expansion plans with the development of HPC data centers with 300 megawatts in the next 24 months. APLD is securing credit for these facilities. The executives are confident to comply with these timelines due to the growing service demand and funding. APLD also reported ordering 34,000 GPUs for the cloud services segment and deploying 1,024 GPUs in the three months ending August 31. The company obtained the first revenue for its first HPC contract, and the client made a prepayment as part of the agreement signed in May 2023. The contract was signed with its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sai Computing, and the deal is worth $180 million over 24 months. APLD also signed two more customer agreements that include significant advance payments. With those contracts, the total annual contract value for contract services is expected to be approximately $378 million for AI cloud services in the annual contract value. These are notable and encouraging developments for a company with a market of $728.32 million as they herald sustained revenue growth boosted by cryptocurrencies' price action. However, a risk hangs over the company. In October 2023, a securities fraud action lawsuit against APLD was filed by investors with substantial losses in the period from April 13, 2022, to July 26, 2023. The complaint filed alleges that APLD failed in the following points. First, APLD overstated the business's profitability and ability to transition into a low-cost AI cloud service provider. Additionally, the Board of Directors had links with the IPO’s underwriters, contravening NASDAQ listing rules, which likely harmed the company significantly. If proven, these allegations could lead to financial and reputational damages for Applied Digital and potential restitution for affected shareholders. On July 6, 2023, Wolfpack Research , The Bear Cave, raised questions about the business model of APLD as a low-cost AI Cloud Service provider, claiming that it is not an AI company. After that, on July 28, The Friendly Bear also published a short report on APLD highlighting governance issues. Nevertheless, on December 8, APLD presented a 12% share increase, probably related to blockchain mining in a market where BTC is growing. Source: Investor presentation, May 2023. APLD is mostly a bet on cryptocurrencies because its main segment is Hosting. Naturally, hosting provides infrastructure for crypto mining customers. The business model is quite interesting, as it’s not exactly cloud computing. Instead, customers give APLD their hardware, and APLD then places it on its facilities, operating the hardware entrusted and performing maintenance operations. In exchange, APLD charges a fee. As such, it’s inextricably linked to cryptocurrency prices, the largest of which is Bitcoin. Too Cheap To Pass Up: Valuation Analysis In fact, from a valuation perspective, we can reduce our analysis down to the hosting segment. As you can see in the figure below, the Hosting segment contributed 94.1% of the company’s total quarterly revenues and was the only profitable segment of the whole company. This makes APLD essentially a purely crypto mining play, despite the Cloud Services segment seemingly promising AI spin. In fact, for the latest quarter, APLD’s AI segment lost almost 83.0% of the profits that the Hosting segment generated. This throws cold water on the AI narrative that APLD has. In my opinion, the company remains a crypto-related venture almost in its entirety. Source: APLD’s latest 10-Q. However, this is not necessarily a negative thing, and the recent rise in Bitcoin’s price has been an undeniable tailwind for the company. Since it’s a crypto mining-related company, demand for cryptocurrencies increases the price of these financial assets, making mining more profitable. The more profitable crypto mining is, the more mining operations will occur. This directly impacts the company’s revenues, as APLD was the quintessential shovel-selling company during Bitcoin’s gold rush. This is a rather profitable approach to the nascent cryptocurrency sector, and analysts currently expect APLD to generate roughly $754.89 million in annual revenues by 2025. Source: Seeking Alpha. If such revenue growth materializes, APLD will have increased its revenues from $8.55 million in 2022 to $754.89 million by 2025. This would be an incredibly high revenue CAGR of 345.3%. APLD currently has $104.0 million in debt and a small cash reserve of $5.9 million. Moreover, I estimate the company burned through $28.1 million in cash during the latest quarter. I obtained this figure by adding the cash flow from operations and net CAPEX. This is concerning as the company will soon run out of cash to sustain its operations. Naturally, if such impressive revenue growth materializes, the additional revenues should be able to fund APLD’s cash needs. However, there appears to be little breathing room for APLD at this juncture, which is why the next quarter will be vital. If APLD shows growing cash reserves alongside a substantial revenue jump, I presume APLD could soon become a cash-generating machine. However, until then, APLD’s low liquidity has been a question mark for the company, adding uncertainty to the stock as a potential investment. Nevertheless, if we assume APLD will indeed grow its revenues as expected, its current price tag appears too conservative, bringing a potential investment opportunity. The valuation equation would be rather simple. APLD’s latest 10-Q claims its Hosting segment has a 26.2% profit margin. Since APLD’s revenues are 94.1% Hosting revenues, most of the company’s future growth will come from this segment. It’s hard to picture the company's revenue mix in the future. Still, even if we assume that just 50% of the projected $754.89 million 2025 revenues come from Hosting, that’d imply $98.89 million in annual Hosting profits. Since APLD’s current market cap is $728.32, it’d price the company at a 7.4 P/E ratio and a 1.0 P/S ratio. These valuation multiples are arguably cheap on their own but particularly inexpensive when considering APLD would easily be a high-growth company, further corroborating APLD’s “buy” thesis. Investment Thesis Risks However, as with most investments, risks are involved, and APLD is no exception. APLD’s risks are mainly related to crypto and AI. These are rapidly evolving trends, and crypto is notably volatile. When there are periods of rapidly appreciating cryptocurrencies, APLD should benefit, as I previously discussed. However, the reverse is also true. Moreover, APLD’s business model is highly capital intensive, dealing with maintenance costs and regular CAPEX investments to grow and sustain its business. If a decline period occurs and APLD is caught off guard with low cash reserves, it’d quickly burn through its cash and face low liquidity risks to fund its operations. I don’t think APLD is an imminent bankruptcy risk, but it’s hard to imagine such a scenario occurring without a severe price drop in APLD’s stock, which is why it’s worth considering this risk. APLD has rebounded alongside Bitcoin’s price. (TradingView.) Additionally, it’s uncertain if the Cloud segment will remain as unprofitable as it is today. In my “buy” scenario, I didn’t account for the rest of the revenues being also profitable, or at least not meaningfully unprofitable as they are today. Concretely, suppose the remaining 50% of revenues were as unprofitable as APLD’s Cloud segment was this latest quarter. In that case, it’d wipe out 83.0% of the Hosting segment’s profits and materially worsen APLD’s valuation equation. So, the buy thesis is inherently embedded with the assumption of improving Cloud margins, which is realistic but not guaranteed, making it a vital risk to consider before investing in APLD. Conclusion Overall, APLD is a promising company that’s essentially a bet in crypto mining at this stage. It may become more of an AI investment in the future, but that remains uncertain for now. Nevertheless, APLD is undoubtedly poised to become a growth company benefiting from the rise of cryptocurrencies. Its valuation equation appears undervalued at this stage as long as its projected growth materializes, which is a reasonable assumption. Given that the current price tag is remarkably cheap in the face of the forecasted revenue growth, I think there’s a wide margin of safety embedded in APLD at these levels. In my view, this makes APLD a reasonably good “buy” at these levels.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4657404-applied-digital-good-bet-in-crypto-mining?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/21310650.jpeg
21310577,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=564958,1702374350,"Crypto Expert Explains Why The Bitcoin Price Crash To $40,000 Is Not A Bad Thing","A crypto expert has explained why a Bitcoin pullback (possibly to around $40,000) isn’t a bad thing. This comes as there is a growing concern that the flagship cryptocurrency could soon lose all the gains it has achieved in recent times. A Bitcoin Correction Is Necessary In a post on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, William Clemente, the co-founder of Reflexivity Research, suggested this correction was necessary as it would “shake out “weak hands” and leverage, allowing for a stronger foundation for eventual moves higher.” He further mentioned that Bitcoin’s volatility “is a feature, not a bug.” Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Short-Term XRP Price Rally To $18 He made this statement in relation to his assertion that the crypto token has doubled in two months with no pullbacks. Although it hasn’t exactly doubled, Bitcoin has, however, experienced a significant surge these past few months. This has come on the back of the possibility of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving the pending Spot BTC ETF applications. This impressive rally has indeed happened, with the flagship cryptocurrency hardly experiencing any pullback. The bulls have firmly remained in control, with the bears having to bear the brunt of this as many continue to experience heart-wrenching liquidations. However, just like with every other asset, a correction is always expected at some point, and that could be now. BTC price recovers above $42,000 | Source: BTCUSD On Tradingview.com A BTC Correction is Already Happening Bitcoin is already facing a retracement as more longs than shorts have liquidated in the last 24 hours, according to data from Coinglass. In an earlier X post, Clemente had warned that there would “be sharp corrections along the way as the market shakes off greedy leveraged longs.” Meanwhile, the reason for the breather from Bitcoin could also be a result of those waiting on the sidelines to see the outcome of the macroeconomic events happening this week. This includes the CPI inflation data that is set to be released on December 12, which will be closely followed by the FOMC meeting happening on that same day and December 13. Related Reading: Why Is Ethereum Price Down To $2,200 Today? Many will be hoping that the outcome of those events is rather positive as that would further ignite the bullish sentiment that is currently reverberating throughout the crypto community. Irrespective of what happens, this sentiment isn’t expected to dwindle as many still have their sights set on January when a Spot Bitcoin ETF could be approved. Liquidity is also flowing into the ecosystem, with digital asset investment products experiencing their 11th straight week of inflows at $43 million. Bitcoin remains the major focus of these investors, with the flagship crypto token seeing $20 million in inflows. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $42,000, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

China's Ministry of Public Security spearheaded the initiative, called RealDID, with help from BSN.  The RealDID service launch will enable users to register and log in to websites anonymously using DID addresses and private keys, ensuring that business data and transactions remain disconnected from personal information.  China's top six social media platforms, including WeChat, Sina Weibo, Douyin, Kuaishou, Bilibili, and Xiaohongshu, mandate content creators with over 500,000 or 1 million followers to publicly display their real names or those of their financial backers, state media reported in October.  State media said this was to enhance credibility and enable public supervision.  BSN said in a release that this is the world's first national-level real-name decentralized identity system.  BSN China is run by China's National Information Center in collaboration with Chinese big tech companies China Mobile and China UnionPay. Its international operations are managed independently by BSN Global, which is said to be a separate, firewalled entity.  CoinDesk recently reported that a bipartisan U.S. bill was in the works that would ban federal government officials from using China-made blockchains and transacting with companies like Tether's parent iFinex, aiming to prevent potential national security risks and protect private data from foreign adversaries' access.  Recently, the U.S. removed China's Institute of Forensic Science, which is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Public Security, from a trade sanctions list to advance counternarcotics cooperation, despite concerns over China's human rights practices, aiming to combat the trafficking of fentanyl and related chemicals into the U.S.  Following this, China warned its chemical manufacturers against producing fentanyl precursors.

The bonds are set to be offered on Bitfinex Securities, a regulated division of crypto exchange Bitfinex.  “The Volcano Bond has just received regulatory approval from the Digital Assets Commission (CNAD),” El Salvador’s National Bitcoin Office posted from its X handle. “We anticipate the bond will be issued during the first quarter of 2024.”  President Nayib Bukele apparently confirmed the approval on X, posting “Wen volcano bond?” early Tuesday and reposting several posts that said the bonds would be issued in Q1 2024.  The so-called “Volcano bonds” were announced in 2021 by President Nayib Bukele shortly after he passed a law recognizing bitcoin (BTC) as legal tender in the country.  Bukele’s target was to raise $1 billion via the bitcoin-backed bonds – seeding a bitcoin mining industry reliant solely on renewable energy, including that generated by the country’s active volcanos.  Issuance was initially planned for March 2022 but was postponed several times. However, the digital assets bill was finally introduced in the Legislative Assembly at the end of November 2022, where Bukele’s party, Nuevas Ideas, has a large majority.  Sixty-two legislators voted for the law today, and 16 voted against it, and the law was finally passed in January 2021.  The development is the second major bitcoin-focused move in as many weeks.

21302140,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=564925,1702350041,"Bitcoin “Washout” Completed, BTC Ready For $48,000—And Higher","Earlier today, Bitcoin (BTC) flash crashed to as low as $40,400 before rebounding to spot levels. This sudden drop triggered what Mike Alfred, a crypto value investor, said was a “textbook washout” necessary to liquidate speculators. The drop and bounce, Alfred further explained, has “wiped out open interest and is exactly what you want to see” before prices recover, possibly edging to $48,000 in the coming sessions. Bitcoin Drops, Over $120 Million Liquidated The washout, if past even guides, might have dented sentiment, forcing inexperienced holders and traders to take profit, allowing HOLDers more control. If that’s the case, considering that the uptrend remains when Bitcoin’s price action is analyzed from a top-down preview, it could be the foundation for further gains in the days ahead. Related Reading: Why Is Ethereum Price Down To $2,200 Today? Besides the heightened volatility and likelihood of potential profit-taking volatility, the resulting correction also led to some liquidation. According to Coinglass data on December 11, the flash crash saw over $105 million of leveraged long positions liquidated. Conversely, more than $15 million in short positions forcefully closed as prices quickly recovered, going against some traders’ positions. While responding to Alfred’s preview, some observers noted that liquidating high-leveraged long positions has effectively removed bearish elements from the market. In turn, this has positively paved the way for more price gains in the days ahead. Will BTC Float To New All-Time Highs? Looking at the Bitcoin daily price chart, the uptrend remains even with the coin consolidating in lower time frames. Whether today’s sell-off will be confirmed in the next 24 hours remains to be seen. However, from the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart, the long lower wick suggests that lower lows are being rejected. Notably, the coin has support at the 20-day moving average, highlighting the importance of this dynamic line. Related Reading: Avalanche Rules Top 10 Ranking With 61% Weekly Gain – Here’s The Scoop The price chart shows that the $45,000 level is critical resistance. If there is a solid, high volume growth above this level, BTC might not only expand above $48,000 and $50,000, but it could anchor the leg up towards $69,000 in the next coming weeks. Market participants view the potential approval of the first Bitcoin ETF in early January 2024 by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a bullish catalyst for BTC bulls. Amid evolving crypto regulations in the US, Europe, and beyond, a regulated ETF would provide institutional investors with a more accessible way to gain exposure to Bitcoin, potentially driving demand and pushing prices higher.

Bitcoin [BTC] whipsawed from $43,000 to as low as $40,300, data shows, leading drops across major tokens such as Chainlink [LINK], Cardano’s ADA and Solana’s SOL, which dropped over 8% before slightly recovering.  Generally riskier bets shiba inu [SHIB] and dogecoin [DOGE], two dog-themed meme tokens, fared slightly better with a 5% drop. Meanwhile, BNB Chain’s BNB, Avalanche’s AVAX, and Celestia’s TIA showed strength with gains of as much as 20% – unaffected by weakness in bitcoin.  Nearly $475 million in longs, or bets on higher prices, and $73 million in shorts, or bets against, booked losses amid a general unwinding of leveraged bets as high funding rates set the stage for a shaky market environment.  Data shows that most liquidations took place on OKX at $190 million, followed by Binance at $148 million and Huobi at nearly $60 million.  The largest single liquidation order happened on Bitmex, a chainlink [LINK] futures position that was worth over $33 million.  Liquidations occur when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position owing to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader cannot meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position, that is, when they don't have sufficient funds to keep the trade open.  Meanwhile, some market watchers told CoinDesk that bitcoin’s recent rally was backed by strong fundamentals – one that catapults it to a “never seen before” era.  “Momentum has been consistently building in the Bitcoin builders space all year, and we are now seeing the markets reflect the excitement around the increased activity,” shared Muneed Ali, founder of Bitcoin development firm Trust Machines, in an email to CoinDesk. “Due to the rise of Ordinals and Bitcoin L2s, there are reasons to be bullish on the Bitcoin ecosystem.

The relevant indicator here is the “social volume,” which keeps track of the number of unique posts/threads/messages on the various social media platforms that mention a specific topic. The metric counts the posts themselves instead of the mentions because this method provides a more accurate representation of the behavior among social media users as a whole. Related Reading: SEC’s “Crypto Asset Securities” Alert Boosts Spot Bitcoin ETF Prospects – Here’s Why Consider two scenarios: one where a large number of mentions are happening over a few posts and another where mentions are also taking place but are spread out over a large number of posts. In the first, discussion is limited to a specific group of users, but going by the mentions, this case would have as much interest in the topic as the latter when it’s not the case. Now, to find whether “buy the dip” is gaining traction among crypto investors, what Santiment has done is filter out the social volume of crypto first and then search these posts for the mention of terms related to this idea. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the social volume for this topic over the last month: The value of the metric appears to have spiked recently | Source: Santiment on X The graph shows that the crypto social volume for terms related to “buy the dip” has shot up after this plummet in the market. In the same chart, the analytics firm has also attached the “social dominance” data, which keeps track of what percentage of these discussions are adding up. Social dominance has also registered a spike recently, and at the peak of this spike, it seems the metric assumed a value of about 0.7, which means 0.7% of all discussions related to the crypto sector involved this topic. “Crypto has experienced its fastest drop in 4 months as markets have corrected and caused mild trader concerns,” notes Santiment. “There is a high level of buythedip calls, which typically means that there is a bit of overeagerness and FOMO on these low prices.” Related Reading: 63.2% Of PEPE Holders Now In Profit: How This Compares With DOGE, SHIB While the market is optimistic about this plunge, too much optimism about things like “bottoms” has historically actually backfired for the assets’ prices.

21299788,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=564902,1702342802,"Market Jolt: Bitcoin Falls Below $42,000 As Short Term Holders Rush To Cash In","Bitcoin is currently witnessing a decline in price, with its value dropping below the $42,000 mark. This movement comes on the heels of a significant uptick in the circulating supply of profitable Bitcoin, prompting a wave of profit-taking among investors. ETC Group’s Head of Research, André Dragosch, highlights this trend, noting an increase in Bitcoin being moved to exchanges for potential sale. Dragosch noted, citing data from Glassnode: Overall exchange balances for bitcoin have clearly picked up, implying a net inflow of coins to exchanges over the past week. More specifically, around +14k BTC have flown into exchanges on a net basis according to data provided by Glassnode. This will likely exert some downside pressure on prices in the short term. Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Drive Selling Pressure According to the ETC Group, the current market scenario presents a landscape where a substantial portion of Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses are profitable. Data from the firm indicates that 88.3% of BTC addresses and 77.6% of ETH addresses are currently profitable, figures hovering near the highest for the year. Related Reading: The Bitcoin Spot ETF Boom: VanEck Forecasts $2.4 Billion Inflows In Q1 2024 This environment of a high percentage of BTC and ETH addresses being in a state of profit has seemingly encouraged a segment of investors, particularly those with a short-term investment perspective, to capitalize on their gains, as indicated by the ETC Group’s analysis. The ETC group further revealed that these short-term investors, defined as those who have held Bitcoin for less than 155 days, have been transferring their profitable assets to exchanges at a rate not seen since July of this year. This surge in selling pressure is attributed to a key factor restraining the Bitcoin rally as the market adjusts to the increased availability of the cryptocurrency. Further illustrating the market’s reaction, the past week marked the first instance of “net outflows” from crypto asset exchange-traded products (ETPs) since early October. The total amount of these outflows was approximately $18.2 million, with Bitcoin ETPs experiencing the majority of these withdrawals, totaling $13.1 million. In contrast, Ethereum ETPs saw a “net inflow” of $5.8 million, suggesting a diverging investor interest between the two leading crypto. Market Impact And Trader Liquidations The recent decline in Bitcoin’s price from its previous high of around $44,000 has impacted investor sentiment and resulted in significant trader liquidations. According to data from Coinglass, over the last 24 hours, there have been 115,873 trader liquidations, culminating in roughly $424.67 million in total liquidations. Bitcoin has led these liquidations, with $105.51 million in long liquidations and $14.95 million in short liquidations. Ethereum follows closely, accounting for $78.53 million in long and $7.41 million in short liquidations.

21298644,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=564917,1702339237,"Crypto Sentiment Index Stays Bullish Despite Corrections, Report Reveals Positive Outlook","In a recent blog post, ETC Group’s Head of Research, Andre Dragosh, provided a comprehensive analysis of the current state of the crypto market. Dragosh’s findings shed light on the market’s performance dynamics, profit-taking activity, and derivative trends. High-Risk Appetite In Crypto Market According to Dragosh’s analysis, crypto assets showcased their resilience as they outperformed traditional assets like equities, supported by a significant repricing in monetary policy expectations and short futures liquidations at the beginning of last week. However, this outperformance encountered some limitations in the short term due to stronger-than-expected US jobs data, which began to dampen the recent rally. The US non-farm payroll growth and unemployment rate surpassed consensus estimates, leading to a reversal in US Treasury yields and a decrease in overall risk appetite across traditional financial markets. Related Reading: Bitcoin $42,000 Support Under Pressure As Short Position Inflows Soar Notably, altcoin outperformance gained momentum during the period, with Avalanche (AVAX) and Cardano (ADA) returning over 50% each. Among the top 10 crypto assets, Avalanche, Cardano, and Polkadot (DOT) stood out as the relative outperformers. According to Dragosh, this surge in altcoin outperformance compared to Bitcoin (BTC) indicates a “high-risk appetite” within the crypto market. On the other hand, on-chain data for Bitcoin suggests that investors are increasingly taking profits, evidenced by the rising number of coins in profit being sent to exchanges. ETC Group’s in-house Crypto Asset Sentiment Index remained relatively elevated compared to the previous week, indicating positive market sentiment. However, major reversals to the downside were observed in the Crypto Dispersion Index and the BTC 25-delta 1-month option skew. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index continued to reside in “Greed” territory, reflecting ongoing market optimism. Although ETC Group’s Cross Asset Risk Appetite (CARA) measure declined slightly, it remained in positive territory, signaling a decrease in risk appetite in traditional financial markets. Performance dispersion among digital assets decreased compared to the previous week but remained relatively high. This implies that correlations among crypto assets have decreased, and investments are driven by coin-specific factors, highlighting the importance of diversification among digital assets. Short-Term Holders Cash In The market remains in a strong profit environment, with a significant percentage of BTC and ETH addresses in profit. According to Dragosh, profit-taking activity, particularly among short-term holders, has increased as Bitcoin approaches recent highs, leading to higher selling pressure. Long-term holders have also increased their transfers of profitable coins to exchanges, potentially hindering short-term price increases. However, it is worth noting that there is no evidence of older coins being spent, which would indicate a larger price correction.

BTC option open interest saw a significant increase, accompanied by relative put-buying and an increase in the put-call open interest ratio. The 25-delta BTC option skews also increased, indicating higher demand for puts compared to calls. However, overall at-the-money (ATM) implied volatilities did not change significantly. At the time of writing, BTC has lost its $42,000 support line, trading at $41,600, down 5% in the last 24 hours.
