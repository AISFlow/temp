42425853,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgVBh,1404338980,Silk Road Auction Winner Tim Draper: World Should Embrace Bitcoin,"Investor Tim Draper, managing director of VC firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson and the winning bidder in the 27th June auction of roughly 30,000 BTC conducted by the US Marshals Service, held a press conference today where he provided new details about his plans in the bitcoin space.  The press conference included introductory remarks from Tim Draper, before opening up to a question-and-answer session led by the investor's son and fellow VC investor Adam Draper and including Vaurum CEO Avish Bhama.  Speaking to gathered reporters, Draper painted a picture of how bitcoin is uniting a diverse range of innovators around the world, all of whom are seeking to unlock the broader financial innovations that can be achieved through its applications.  Draper also indicated that he plans to further invest in bitcoin startups, saying:  ""I am so enthusiastic about bitcoin, I know that our next fund is going to have a very high concentration of bitcoin companies, we have a high focus on [financial innovation].""  Draper revealed only sparse details about his interactions with the USMS, stating that despite requests for the government to send the bitcoins in two transactions – one to confirm the wallet address and another to complete the transaction – it was insistent that all 29,656 bitcoins be sent in one exchange.  Now that the bitcoins are in his possession, however, he said he is no longer worried about their safety, explaining:  ""All I know is this money is more secure than the money that is in my investment bank.""  Global bitcoin movement  Tim Draper used the format to list a number of bitcoin projects he feels are working to secure a new vision for the global economy, including Mexico's Coincove, Korea's Korbit and Argentina's BitPagos.  Addressing the audience during a question-and-answer session, Bhama called the idea that bitcoin is volatile a US construct, a sentiment with which Draper agreed.  ""We really think that this is a big opportunity and clearly there is a lot of interest all over the world for people to look and see a new kind of currency, something that is not tied to political nations that are out there,"" Draper said.  The comments come in the face of criticism from global regulators, who have warned consumers about the risk posed by bitcoin and its price fluctuations.  Tim Draper is an investor in BitPagos and Korbit, while Adam Draper's Boost VC invested in Coincove.  Encouraging investors  Draper also sought to highlight bitcoin's potential as an investment opportunity, encouraging those listening to get involved in the ecosystem and thanking original inventor Satoshi Nakamoto for what he called an ""amazing trading system"".  ""I think the world should, as soon as you possibly can, take advantage of bitcoin. [...] We are all going to be so much better off because of this.""  However, Draper would not give any details on how much he paid for the bitcoins, saying only:  ""I paid more than the other people in the auction.""  The event was held at 55 E 3rd Avenue in San Mateo, California, and was also broadcasted on the web via Livestream.  Liquidity in emerging markets  The conversation built off of the original announcement issued through Medium and authored by Bhama, with whom Draper will work to improve bitcoin's liquidity in developing markets.  Draper said in a statement at the time:  ""Of course, no one is totally secure in holding their own country’s currency. We want to enable people to hold and trade bitcoin to secure themselves against weakening currencies.”  The news followed yesterday's announcement by the USMS that one unnamed bidder had won all 10 auction blocks on Friday.  About Tim Draper  Draper first began his public support for bitcoin last year following the announcement that his Silicon Valley university, Draper University of Heroes, would accept bitcoin. Draper has since backed bitcoin startup Vaurum, with whom he is partnering to provide a use for the coins.  A third-generation venture capitalist, Tim Draper’s son Adam Draper has pledged to fund 100 startups focused on the bitcoin industry over the next three years.

42425857,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgV9h,1404336302,Mike Hearn Wins $40k Bounty for Bitcoin Core Crowdfunding Platform,"BitcoinJ developer and former Google engineer Mike Hearn, creator of the decentralized crowdfunding platform Lighthouse, has been awarded the majority of a $100,000 bounty.  The bounty was offered by self-proclaimed bitcoin millionaire and entrepreneur Olivier Janssens, who in a post on the bitcoin subreddit from June called for a platform to facilitate funding for critical bitcoin projects. In his original statement, Janssens argued that the Bitcoin Foundation was failing to adequately fund bitcoin core development. Because of this, he stated, the bounty winner’s project should serve as a replacement for the Foundation itself.  On 2nd July, Janssens announced that Hearn will receive $40,000 of the $100,000 bounty once Lighthouse is released. The crowdfunding platform is expected to go live sometime in August. Janssens added that a decentralized funding solution takes the politics out of the financing of bitcoin-related development, saying:  “Bitcoin is apolitical. I know it takes time to get out of this mindset, but bitcoin truly liberates the world beyond politics. We should not attempt to recreate unnecessary overhead or middlemen. Let’s have bitcoin set us free.”  Lighthouse, he continued, was chosen because of its ability to directly fund core development, as well as initiatives related to lobbying, community involvement and next-generation bitcoin projects.  CoinDesk reached out to Hearn for comment but did not receive an immediate reply.  Bridging the core development funding gap  In the announcement post, Janssens said that Lighthouse will help resolve a growing problem within the bitcoin community: the underfunding of core development. Lighthouse’s decentralized structure allows projects to crowdfund using bitcoin, and includes several innovative features that streamline the overall process.  As well as awarding Hearn $40,000 at the completion and launch of Lighthouse, Janssens will contribute another $50,000 to the first project listed on Lighthouse that supports bitcoin core development. The remaining $10,000 from the bounty was awarded to the team behind Eris, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) platform.  Janssens said that the Bitcoin Foundation has failed to meet critical funding needs owing to the structure and operational tendencies of the organization, necessitating a project like Lighthouse.  He cited past statements from the Foundation which detailed its financial resources but acknowledged the long-term funding challenges the organization currently faces. As a result, vital funding streams for core development are at risk of disruption should the Foundation experience financing problems down the road.  Janssens said:  “They have admitted this buffer won’t last and is going to be a serious issue in the future. We also don’t know how much they are paying the developers and how much money they have left, since their transparency is pretty much non-existent. The funding could stop at any time and endanger Bitcoin even more.”  He noted that Lighthouse enables the community to propose core funding initiatives, leveraging the power of crowdfunding to determine support for a particular project. Specifically, the platform allows bitcoin core developers to seek funding for what they are working on, which would promote greater transparency and accountability.  Calls for funding action  The bounty award is the latest sign that members of the bitcoin community see a need for core development funding to be better managed.  Hearn  himself recently spoke about his concerns regarding the financial stability of core development efforts.  In a recent interview, Hearn said developers were “radically underfunded” and that progress in resolving the issue was coming too slowly. As a result, there has been a serious disruption to core development and that critical needs of the network risked going unmet because the resources aren’t there.  Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire echoed these sentiments in an interview with CoinDesk ahead of the Bitcoin Finance 2014 Conference in Dublin on 2nd July. Arguing that the development community needs to “step up”, Allaire remarked that “something needs to evolve there” in order for the bitcoin industry to remain healthy.

42425864,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgVTh,1404332726,Expedia Exec Says Bitcoin Spending Has Exceeded Estimates,"Washington-based online travel booking giant Expedia announced it would begin accepting bitcoin for payments on 11th June, and in a new interview the company confirms that its first foray into the ecosystem is already a success.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Expedia's executive vice president of global product Michael Gulmann declined to release firm figures regarding the total bitcoin sales the company has seen so far, but reported that they have exceeded estimates.  Gulmann told CoinDesk:  ""We did some estimates based on the size of Overstock and the size of Expedia, and came up with our own estimates of what we could expect, and we're meeting and exceeding those.""  Further, Gulmann moved to dismiss suggestions that Expedia may simply be testing bitcoin as a payment method, and that it doesn't yet have plans to integrate the payment more broadly. He stated that hotel bookings were rather a logical starting point for adding bitcoin due to the fact that the offering accounts for the lion's share of the company's sales, adding:  ""Certainly, there are people who want to book airline tickets with Expedia, but it made sense from a technology standpoint, from a business standpoint and from a customer demand standpoint to jump out with hotels first.""  Gulmann went on to suggest that, should it have been considering bitcoin payments as a trial, it has already received the feedback it sought.  The announcement that Expedia would accept bitcoin through Coinbase added yet another billion-dollar company to the ecosystem, providing new evidence to support Coinbase's prior assertions that as many as 10 companies of that size could begin accepting bitcoin in 2014.  Global hotel expansion  To date, Expedia only offers bitcoin payments for hotel bookings to US customers, and only as part of its 'Pay Now' payment option for which it accepts payment on behalf of the customer. This allows the company to offer bitcoin payment services for all 45,000 of its hotels, ""in one fell swoop"".  But Gulmann suggested that the company is likely to extend the payment method to its other offerings, including flight bookings, car rentals and more.  He implied the addition of the company's bitcoin payment option for all global hotel services could be the next step in expanding the service, stating:  ""I think we've already seen what we've needed to see, now it just comes down to timing. The primary [goal] would be to get it up globally for our hotels.""  This would require the addition of the payment option for hotel bookings on all or a greater number of the company's global sites.  Expedia also offers a 'Pay Later' option for hotel bookings, in which customers can select to reserve lodging with its services, but pay proprietors directly on arrival. In this case, Expedia does not facilitate payment, so its bitcoin services are not applicable.  Customer habits  Gulmann also provided an insight into whether he feels bitcoin would be suited for wider use in the travel industry, given that credit cards not only successfully target the industry through rewards programs, but may also come with additional insurance options.  He said that he suspects that bitcoin's lack of these features would not be a deterrent to customers, saying:  ""We've never seen the form of payment to be something that the customers use as a way to protect themselves. [...] It's not something that we've heard, or that is a big concern right now.""  He added that bitcoin buyers can take advantage of the company's additional insurance packages for hotels in order to add protection.  Any bitcoin refunds will be handled by Coinbase, according to Expedia's terms and conditions. Refunds are issued for the USD value of the booking, and are converted into bitcoin based on the exchange rate set by Coinbase.  No more dangerous than cash  Gulmann also indicated that the decision for Expedia to take bitcoin was not without its resistance internally, though he likened the discussion to the one happening more broadly around the globe.  The Expedia executive said he worked to educate those in the company who might have been influenced by bitcoin's sometimes negative media perception, saying:  ""I explained it and what it really is. The simplest analogy is, it's no more dangerous than cash. Cash is more anonymous than bitcoin at the end of the day.""  He further stated that bitcoin makes sense for Expedia given that, beyond providing travel services, Expedia is also a technology company.  ""It was the perfect combination of the ability to do something really, really interesting from a technology standpoint, work with our hotel partners, really close that gap between customer demand and helping fill hotel rooms for our hotel partners,"" he added.

42425846,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgUth,1404328535,Jeremy Allaire: Bitcoin Developers Need to 'Step Up',"Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire has called on bitcoin’s core developers to “step up” and create a more open, inclusive and well-defined process for the protocol’s development.  Describing the current state of development as “very ad-hoc, reputation based” and unwelcoming to new participants, he said that the amount of money being invested into bitcoin demanded “a more well-defined governance process and contribution process”.  “The whole industry should be contributing to the IP of bitcoin,” Allaire told CoinDesk ahead of the Bitcoin Finance 2014 conference in Dublin on 2nd July. “The reality is today that we’re shut out.”  In a wide-ranging interview, he said that a significant number of people currently on Circle’s waiting list would have full access by at least the end of July, that volatility was the key impediment to bitcoin’s progress, and that Circle was generally supportive of Ethereum developer Vitalik Buterin's proposals for solving the problem of centralized mining.  Proper standards for bitcoin development  Pointing towards institutions like the World Wide Web consortium as a possible model, Allaire said it is time for the bitcoin community to develop a more sustainable system for the development of the core protocol, which is currently largely managed by a few core developers employed by the Bitcoin Foundation.  Although he declined to name any specific persons, he said that “all of the core developers, they need to step back and think about how do we get more IP contribution and what kind of process is needed to facilitate that”.  “For quite some time [bitcoin] was justifiably [managed by] a more narrow group of people operating in a meritocracy but now that this has got to something that entire industries are being built on, something needs to evolve there.”  His comments echo those made by bitcoinj developer Mike Hearn, an advisor to Circle who recently told Epicenter Bitcoin that development on the bitcoin core had ground to a ""complete halt” and that it was ""radically underfunded and underdeveloped"".  “The risk is that you end up with a hard fork scenario,” said Allaire, referring to a situation where the protocol is copied and developed as a separate project. “If it’s not addressed, I think that a range of ecosystem participants will just say we’re going to do a hard fork and try and do this in a more scalable community-based way.”  This isn’t the first time members of the bitcoin community have raised the issue of how the bitcoin protocol is developed. When current lead developer Wladimir Van Der Laan took up the role in February this year, he told CoinDesk that a top priority was improving the developer documentation in order to encourage participation.  Decentralising mining and regulation  Although the furore around ghash.io’s share of the bitcoin mining network has largely died down, the issue itself has yet to be solved. While there has been disagreement about whether centralized mining is a problem or not, Allaire said, “a truly distributed decentralized network … is really core to the DNA and the principles of bitcoin”.  Ethereum developer Vitalik Buterin recently proposed changing bitcoin mining to make it more resilient to specialised ASIC mining hardware and to allow for CPU mining so that the barrier for participation is lower, which Allaire said “aligned well” with internal Circle discussions about the issue.  “But I don’t agree that the sky is falling and all of a sudden there’s going to be double-spending attacks ... because I think there’s an alignment of economic incentives,” he added, noting that he believes it is in the economic interests of mining pool operators to maintain trust in the system.  Although he suggested that large-scale investors would inevitably begin investing to secure bitcoin’s decentralized infrastructure, he said Circle, though venture capital-backed, was not “in a financial position to make vast global investments in [bitcoin] infrastructure right now”.  On regulation, he rejected the idea that venture-backed bitcoin businesses are embracing government regulation, saying that the high barriers to entry created by, for example, the US state licensing laws, were damaging to the long-term goal of bitcoin’s mainstream adoption.  “I’ve been clear that we have to eliminate [these barriers] so that young companies can get in,” he said. “Whatever regulatory approach governments take should be minimally viable. Ideally not new laws, but interpretations and adaptions of existing rules so that the timeline for clarity is shortened.”  Circle’s slow and steady approach  It is just over a month since Circle finally unveiled its bitcoin wallet service at the Bitcoin2014 conference in Amsterdam, and although Allaire declined to disclosed the exact number of current users, he said it was in the thousands.  “We’re being cautious,” he admitted, saying that Circle is focused on ensuring its systems can scale properly before opening its doors.  “If we just opened the doors today, we think we would just get inundated and everyone wouldn’t have a great experience.”  Although many of its users are people who have previously used bitcoin, he said that they had been “trying to identify users who are not existing bitcoin users” so that their userbase would extend beyond bitcoin’s early adopters. By the end of July, Circle will have accepted ""significantly"" more people who had already requested an invite, he added.  Circle has also recently hired former Bank of Ireland director Garrett Cassidy to head up the company's European operations.  A primary focus for the company is price volatility, he said. Though he declined to offer detail on how the company plans to address the issue, he was skeptical that the issue would solve itself:  “Everyone says prices will stabilize. But that isn’t an answer if we really want [bitcoin] to get traction.”  In order to beat the peer-to-peer money transfer apps being developed by tech companies and banking institutions alike, he said, the bitcoin industry has to focus on its strengths, primarily its openness. Though companies like Circle carry some of the “baggage” of old financial institutions, he admitted, bitcoin’s nature as “a global open standard that is completely interoperable” gives it an edge over propositions like Paym in the UK.  ""In five years peer-to-peer financial transactions will become an integrated part of everyone’s day-to-day living, whether it’s across the table or across the planet,” he said.  The challenge for bitcoin companies like Circle is to make sure they’re facilitating those transactions instead of traditional, non-bitcoin fintech companies.      Correction: A previous version of this article said that Circle would be opening to all people who had so far signed up. Circle has since clarified that they would be ""accepting a significant number of invitees by August"", not ""all"".",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MINING | FORKS,Kadhim Shubber,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/02/jeremy-allaire-bitcoin-developers-need-to-step-up,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/da06da0ba4bc9997056cda0986c170f58097a5f7-1024x682.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425854,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgV7h,1404324006,Bank of Russia: Bitcoin Should Not Be Rejected,"Months after the Bank of Russia first broke its silence on bitcoin and digital currencies with stern warnings regarding their potential treatment under the law, regulators have released new statements that suggest the country is further softening its tone on the subject.  The Wall Street Journal has reported that the country's central bank is now in the process of gathering information about bitcoin and digital currencies.  Bank of Russia deputy chairman Georgy Luntovsky has said that while there has been evidence that bitcoin is being used to pay for drugs and weapons in Russia, it will not seek to take harsh measures against its use.  Luntovsky explained:  ""At this stage, we need to watch how the situation develops with these kinds of currencies. These instruments should not be rejected.""  Earlier this year, the Russian central bank issued a warning affirming that the use of bitcoins and other ""money substitutes"" is illegal in the Russian Federation, which in turn caused a widespread fear globally that Russia was seeking to ban its use. Russia is not the only jurisdiction with such legislation on the books. Until recently California had a similar law, banning alternatives to the US dollar – but it was not applied.  Nonetheless, the perception that Russia had banned bitcoin continued long after, with even one major conference postponing its event citing regulatory concerns.  Wait-and-see approach  Luntovsky hinted that his organisation is now taking a “wait-and-see” approach to bitcoin regulation, a move that could prove influential to other jurisdictions as well.  Bitcoin has notably been endorsed by a number of influential executives in the Russian financial sector, including German Gref, who served as a government minister from 2000 to 2007.  Gref currently heads Sberbank, the third-largest bank in Europe, owned by the Bank of Russia. He has said an outright ban of bitcoin would be a “colossal mistake”, and that bitcoin should be studied and regulated.  Money laundering concerns remain  In March, Russian authorities said they were open to a discussion on digital currencies and that the goal of the initial warning was not to ban bitcoin. Rather, it was issued as part of an effort to combat criminal activities that could benefit from an anonymous payments system.  Bitcoin's use in money laundering and other financial crimes is to be the subject of a forthcoming report from the Financial Action Task Force, an intergovernmental body set up to combat money laundering and terrorist financing of which Russia supports.

42425851,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgV5h,1404316591,Lamassu Introduces Open-Source Software for Bitcoin ATM Network,"Lamassu operators can now provide remittance, airport cash exchange and bill payment services via their bitcoin ATMs following the release of Rakía, the company's new open-source software platform.  With the change, current operators of Lamassu ATMs will become independent nodes, no longer having to rely on a centralized service. In turn, they will be able to retain control of price settings, commission rates and background trading.  In a statement, Lamassu co-founder Zach Harvey said that the company doesn’t intend to become another money transfer or exchange service like Western Union or Travelex:  “We want to create a platform for thousands of small businesses to compete against these legacy financial institutions, and against each other. These are markets in dire need of fierce competition to bring down transfer and exchange fees.”  Rakía is currently available on GitHub. The software will demo at the CoinSummit conference in London on 10th-11th July.  Rakía in the remittance market  Speaking to CoinDesk, Harvey emphasized the Rakía platform’s case for shaking up the remittance market and bridging the gap between developed and developing countries.  For the unbanked population of the world, bank-less ATMs are a viable way to convert cash in a more manageable format, he said, adding:  “I think it's a great transitional stage for cryptocurrencies. It's important to the developed world because its legacy financial institutions are flawed. But it’s even more important to emerging markets since many have no access to financial institutions at all.”  Putting plans into action  Harvey further outlined a couple of ways the new software could help remittances – the first being integration with a third-party remittance service like Kipochi, BitPesa or 37coins.  Secondly, Harvey cited fiat-pegged wallet services like BitReserve, which let users send a certain amount of funds to a bitcoin wallet pegged to the receiver's local currency. The recipient would then use either a cash-out bitcoin ATM or a bitcoin-to-cash agent to receive their funds.  The third way, Harvey described, would be for independent agents to use Lamassu’s open-source software to create tools that connect the sending and receiving parties.  Behind each of these use cases is the drive to remove the risk of volatility. “Otherwise,” he said, “it's just a matter of converting fiat to bitcoin and bitcoin back to a different fiat currency.” He added:  “The other main point of these services is to offer a fiat A to fiat B without the sending or receiving parties touching bitcoin, but rather having it completely behind the scenes.”  Competition heats up  The news comes amid increasing competition between Lamassu and Nevada-based Robocoin, which recently rebranded its ATM network as an online bank. In its announcement, CEO Jordan Kelley spoke at length about his company's wider goal of tapping the potentially lucrative bitcoin remittance market.  Lamassu began taking pre-orders for its bitcoin ATMs late last year, and was one of the first entrants in what has become an increasingly competitive market.  In April, the company announced that its products would soon become portals for bitcoin services like remittance services and bill payments. One month later Lamassu introduced two-way transactions to its machines, both moves that suggests it is seeking to keep ahead of its competition.

42425862,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgVPh,1404315508,CoinCorner Launches as Isle of Man's First Cryptocurrency Exchange,"A startup called CoinCorner claims it has launched as the first digital currency exchange on the Isle of Man, a British Crown dependency.  The exchange offers customers the chance buy and sell bitcoin, and trade litecoin, bitcoin and dogecoin, with fees starting from 0.25%. It says it has future plans to provide more options for both fiat and digital currencies.  Effectively, CoinCorner is offering a peer-to-peer marketplace where customers can trade cryptocurrency with other users on the platform, or buy and sell bitcoin.  ""We provide the mechanism so that buyers and sellers get their cryptocurrency at their agreed rate, minus a small fee for providing the service,"" reads the company website.  The company's CEO, Charlie Woolnough, told CoinDesk:  ""Our aim is to give people a secure and trusted place to buy and sell cryptocurrency in an easy and transparent fashion. We believe this is crucial piece in the jigsaw that is needed to drive the wider adoption and greater use of cryptocurrencies.""  UK and EU focus  CoinCorner is offering free deposits in pounds sterling, euros and US dollars for those wishing to buy bitcoin. The service pays out sellers in pounds, which incurs a £10 fee.  The startup says its UK banking facilities will be a boon for the nation's underserved bitcoin market, as transfers from banks within the country will take one to three working days, charge-free.  Transfers from elsewhere in the EU will take two to five days and will incur some bank charges.  ""Our initial focus is the UK and Europe, which we believe currently suffers from a lack of quality competition, but we have the ability to expand globally if we choose,” said Woolnough.  Emphasis on security  ""To minimise risk to our clients,"" the company said, ""we follow the best practice by keeping the majority of the reserve in cold storage, or in other words, not present on the web server. The only amount kept on the server is the amount needed to cover anticipated small withdrawals.""  The company added:  ""Our cold storage device is held offline, fully encrypted and only accessible by a select few individuals authorised to make high-volume withdrawals within CoinCorner.""  Transparency is also an issue CoinCorner believes can set it apart from the opposition and inspire confidence in potential new customers.  “We foresee a future whereby many of the exchanges that currently exist will disappear. Those that survive will be run by credible people in a transparent fashion,"" said Woolnough.  The company's COO, Daniel Scott, added that because cryptocurrency has not always been viewed in a favourable light by some sections of the media, CoinCorner aims to be as transparent as possible with its clients, explaining:  ""Anybody can look on [the site] and see who we are and where we are based. We have assembled a highly credible team with great proven track records that will provide our clients with the comfort that their funds are in safe hands.""  Furthermore, know-your-customer (KYC) procedures have been put in place, requiring users to upload scans of photo ID and proof of residency before they can commence using CoinCorner's services.  Crypto-friendly environment  The Isle of Man, which has long been an attractive, low-tax destination for businesses of all kinds, has recently been positioning itself as an ideal location for companies working in the cryptocurrency space.  In June, the Department of Economic Development announced plans to introduce controls on digital currencies – both to protect businesses and customers using digital currencies, and to provide an environment that enables companies operating within the space to flourish.  ""CoinCorner aims to be the first exchange registered with the Isle of Man Financial Supervision Commission,"" said Woolnough. ""We believe that this will provide some sectors of society, both individuals and institutions, with the additional layer of comfort that they are currently seeking before they will engage with cryptocurrency and start to use it on daily basis.""  He indicated that the welcoming regulatory environment on the island was key to setting up the business in the jurisdiction:  “We liked the Isle of Man’s forward thinking approach to cryptocurrency. Knowing that the Isle of Man government and the local business community support our business gives us added stability.”  At the news of CoinCorner's imminent launch, Peter Greenhill, director of e-business for the Isle of Man Department of Economic Development said:  ""The Department of Economic Development would like to congratulate CoinCorner on its latest initiative.

42425863,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgVNh,1404313983,"Litecoin Price Decouples from Bitcoin, Slump Continues","Litecoin is experiencing its biggest price slump ever.  When the altcoin went mainstream, litecoin closely followed bitcoin’s sometimes extreme price swings, peaking at $40 in late 2013, soon after bitcoin passed the $1,000 mark.  However, in less than two months, litecoin has lost that close relationship with its golden sibling, prompting community members and some industry leaders to question litecoin’s viability.  Barry Silbert, Founder and CEO of SecondMarket, recently posted the following tweet raising the issue:    Litecoin price appears to be decoupling from bitcoin. Money rotating out of Litecoin to bitcoin and other alts? http://t.co/iabRcLqTmz      — Barry Silbert (@barrysilbert) June 30, 2014    Silver to bitcoin’s gold no longer  CoinDesk examined the way litecoin behaved during the bitcoin slump last December and concluded that it appeared to be practically pegged to bitcoin. In fact, since most exchanges offered only LTC/BTC conversion at the time, it effectively was.  However, bitcoin started recovering this April, while litecoin did not, staying flat and trading in the $9-$12 range.  The first half of May saw an unusual period of stability for both currencies, but bitcoin again started rallying in the second half of the month. Litecoin was left behind, hovering around the $10 mark and then dropping to single digits in mid June.  The negative trend continued throughout June and finally worsened this week, experiencing a big slump on 1st July. At press time, litecoin was down 10.1% in just 24 hours. Trading volumes remain low compared to six months ago, but they are creeping up as the price tanks.  To all intents and purposes, litecoin is on its own, having lost its relationship with bitcoin, and, worse, it is obviously in trouble.  Scrypt miners arrive  The advent of powerful scrypt ASIC miners has raised additional concerns in the litecoin community. The first scrypt ASICs are now starting to appear and the biggest names in the industry are set to join the fray.  KnCMiner’s Titan is a good example. The chip has already taped out and the first batch is expected to ship sometime in the third quarter of this year.  The Titan can deliver up to 400MH/s, which means it is as powerful as 400 high-end Radeon GPUs (graphic processor units) of the sort found in gaming PCs. Alpha Technology is promising 250MH/s out of its Viper scrypt miner.  Both cost about $10,000, which gives them an advantage over GPU miners in terms ROI, or dollars per MH/s. The difference is even bigger when efficiency is factored into the equation, as GPU miners waste a lot more energy.  We can only speculate on the number of scrypt ASIC miners bound to join the litecoin network over the next few months, but their effect is likely to be be substantial nonetheless.  Earlier this year KnC said it was planning to build and sell as many as 2,500 Titans in the first production run. The company confirmed it had $2m worth of pre-orders earlier this year.  ROI in trouble?  The biggest problem is the sheer lack of money in litecoin and that other popular alternative cryptocurrency dogecoin.  The combined market cap of the two most popular scrypt altcoins is about $250m, yet KnCMiner was hoping to sell 2,500 Titan miners at $10,000 apiece – and that’s just the first batch of such miners, from a single company.  In other words, if it shipped today, a single batch of KnC’s scrypt miners would cost $25m – roughly 10% of the combined market cap of litecoin and dogecoin.  A glance at those figures reveals that this level of investment in scrypt mining hardware will be hard to justify and maintain in the long run.  Additionally, the added hashing power these miners will bring is likely to further impact prices of scrypt-based altcoins in the near future.

42425843,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgUrh,1404311396,Poloniex Claims All Customers Repaid Following March Bitcoin Hack,"US digital currency exchange Poloniex has released a new update on the customer repayment plan it implemented following the loss of 12.3% of its total bitcoins in a March attack.  In a new press release, Poloniex claims 100% of the customers who experienced a financial loss have been reimbursed after a hacker or hackers reportedly exploited a vulnerability in the exchange's coding in order to steal the funds.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Poloniex owner Tristan D’Agosta indicated his belief that customers have been adequately and successfully compensated for the site issues, stating:  ""97 BTC were taken and 97 BTC were paid back. Although the value of bitcoin fluctuated, it is not very different now from what it was in the beginning of March.""  D'Agosta also stated that Poloniex has since learned from the experience, and that it has adopted additional security measures to reduce the threat of a similar attack, saying:  “Since the hack, we implemented continual automatic auditing of the entire exchange, bolstered the security of all servers, and redesigned the way commands are processed so that an exploit like the one used in March is impossible.""  Poloniex says it repaid customers using what would have been its profits from running the exchange. Based in Montana, the digital currency company trades blackcoin, litecoin and vertcoin, among a number of additional alternative digital currencies.  Customer feedback  At press time, at least one customer had confirmed that he had been reimbursed by the company.  Poloniex user and CEO of Israel-based Uppbit.com Dor Konforty told CoinDesk that he has thus far been impressed with the company's transparency during the repayment process, saying:  ""As a victim of various other bitcoin service meltdowns – BitFunder WeExchange, Cryptorush – I was innately skeptical about my funds being recovered, but quickly changed my attitude due to Tristan’s conductance. It was clear that he was taking responsibility for what had happened.""  CoinDesk has reached out to additional customers, who have not yet responded to inquiries.  Altcoin boost  Though Poloniex suffered a breach of its bitcoin reserves, D'Agosta indicated that it was the success of an altcoin that helped the company escalate its repayment plans.  D'Agosta added:  ""If any coin should be singled out for helping to provide the boost in volume that enabled us to pay back customers quickly, it is Monero (XMR). Being a supporter of innovative cryptocurrencies, we were the first major exchange to list CryptoNotes, and Monero is still traded primarily on Poloniex.""  Though Poloniex was early to list another popular privacy-focused digital currency darkcoin, D'Agosta indicated that darkcoin's trading did not factor as much into customer repayment.  Repayment success  The news of Poloniex's repayment success follows May's headline that online black market website Silk Road 2.0 had reimbursed its users following a February hack.  Both events suggest that such customer repayment plans have seen success, even in the face of early criticisms from users, and that such initiatives could become a viable way for industry businesses to deal with similar setbacks in the future.",POSITIVE,BTC | XMR,ALTCOIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | SPONSORED | XMR,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/02/poloniex-claims-all-customers-repaid-following-march-bitcoin-hack,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f734701f0c0dad90503345e8666c0c3778962d8c-1000x689.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425858,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgVFh,1404306050,VC Tim Draper Revealed as Silk Road Bitcoin Auction Winner,"Pioneering venture capitalist Tim Draper, father of noted bitcoin industry VC Adam Draper and managing director of the VC firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson, has been revealed as the winner of last Friday's US Marshals auction of nearly 30,000 BTC.  The announcement was released via a blog post on Medium issued by California-based bitcoin trading and storage startup Vaurum. Draper was previously named as an investor in the company's $4m seed funding round this May.  In the post authored by Vaurum CEO Avish Bhama, the company announced that Draper intends to partner with Vaurum to use the roughly 30,000 BTC to provide bitcoin liquidity in emerging markets.  Draper said:  ""With the help of Vaurum and this newly purchased bitcoin, we expect to be able to create new services that can provide liquidity and confidence to markets that have been hamstrung by weak currencies.""  The news follows the US Marshals 1st July announcement that one unnamed bidder had claimed all 10 of the auction blocks.  Early bitcoin supporter  Draper first began making headlines in the bitcoin ecosystem last June, when he announced that his Silicon Valley-based higher education facility, Draper University of Heroes, would become the first university to accept bitcoin for tuition payment.  At the time, a spokesperson for Draper University told CoinDesk one student had already begun using bitcoin to pay his college dues, and that the school would be opening a co-working space and incubator across the street from the institution.  According to Crunchbase, Draper's notable recent investments include a host of Internet and technology startups, such as secure text messaging app Gliph, online investment management services provider Nutmeg, and mobile photo-sharing service Path.  Family business  A third-generation venture capitalist, Tim Draper's father, William Henry Draper III, founded Draper & Johnson Investment Company in 1962. Further, William Draper's father, William Henry Draper Jr., founded VC firm Draper, Gaither and Anderson in 1958.  Today, Draper's son, Adam Draper, is heavily involved in the bitcoin space as a VC, and was notably an early investor in California-based bitcoin financial services provider Coinbase, one of the most established bitcoin businesses in the US.  Adam Draper has since launched an ambitious plan to fund 100 bitcoin startups over the next three years through his seed fund and startup incubator, Boost VC.  Vaurum's big move  Of course, while the sale is significant for Draper, the announcement that the coins will be leveraged by Vaurum could also have a large impact on the industry, particularly as more investors become interested in bitcoin's potential.  A member of Boost VC's 2013 summer class of seven startups, Vaurum is aiming to cater to traditional brokerage investors who lack access to bitcoin. The company is currently working on an API for financial organisations and a robust trading engine to meet this goal.  The platform, however, is perhaps best described by Bhama, the firm's CEO, who issued the following statement after its $4m seed round was finalized:  ""Most investors – even savvy institutions – need an easy-to-use and compliant platform through which to buy and sell bitcoins, and we provide that solution.""  Notably, it is not alone in this space, as Google Ventures-backed Buttercoin and Bex.io, which is soon preparing a significant launch in Mexico, are also offering competing solutions.  The news that Vaurum has secured a presumably greater level of access to liquidity than its competitors comes at a time when the industry's institutional investors are heralding an uptick in interest among the lucrative high net worth demographic.  Targeting hedge funds  Vaurum is seeking to popularize a white-label version of a traditional bitcoin exchange, though the company has noted that its service is primarily designed for high-frequency trading.  The company monetizes by charging its partners for a percentage of bitcoin trading, while the partner gains commission for any facilitated fiat trading. As of this May, Vaurum told CoinDesk that its service was already being used by major hedge funds and foreign exchange dealers.  In addition to Tim Draper, the firm is backed by recent BlockScore investor Battery Ventures and AOL CEO Steve Case.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/02/vc-tim-draper-revealed-as-silk-road-bitcoin-auction-winner,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/657585c6549bef193f1a291b52c1276909f6524e-1260x840.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Called 'Vault', the new account was designed in response to demand for a more secure type of wallet from Coinbase's growing customer base of institutions and wealthy individuals, according to company CEO Brian Armstrong, who explained:  ""We are moving to a place where we are starting to offer more and more professional financial services that high net-worth individuals would really expect from their financial service providers.""  Enterprise features  Vault accounts include security features that are common among enterprise bank accounts, such as requiring multiple approvals for a withdrawal.  They also include other extras, like a time-delay feature on withdrawals, which will push a withdrawal back by 48 hours while Coinbase uses a variety of communication channels to contact the account holder to verify the action.  Coinbase said it would release the multi-signature feature for Vault accounts once it has been examined by security experts. Additionally, it notes, the new accounts use the same cold storage technology that the firm deploys for existing customers.  Bitcoin 'savings' account  Vault accounts are free and will be made available to a randomly selected sample of 5% of existing Coinbase users initially, becoming available to all Coinbase users by 16th July.  Vault is designed to complement standard Coinbase wallet accounts. The difference between the two accounts is similar to a traditional bank's checking and savings accounts, Armstrong said, explaining:  ""We really wanted to capture that difference, where you think of a wallet as money that you would store in your back pocket or keep in your purse. It's your day-to-day spending, it's your wallet. The vault is like a savings account.""  Armstrong said his firm had been discussing the idea of a higher-security account for more than a year, but only started working on it several months ago. Over the last few weeks, Coinbase has been testing the new accounts in closed beta.  ""We've really been battle-testing it before we went to publicly announce it,"" Armstrong said.

The minor update reveals a few new facts about the Winklevoss exchange traded fund (ETF).  So far Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have updated their ETF filing four times. The process of registering an ETF is painstakingly slow: the twins originally filed for an investment fund a year ago, on 1st July 2013.  New update reveals ETF symbol  According to the latest filing, shares in the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust will trade on the NASDAQ OMX under the symbol 'COIN'.  There are a number of cosmetic changes too, described by the Wall Street Journal as “minor tweaks”.  The new S-1 lists a number of new risk factors, mostly revolving around government regulation. The filing also outlines Switzerland’s latest legislative measures and notes Bolivia's recent central bank ban on bitcoin.  On the technology front, the filing mentions the possibility of a 51% attack. Another warning is that core developers could stop maintaining the bitcoin protocol unless they are paid. Both issues have received a lot of coverage in recent weeks amid a public debate on mitigating the risk of a 51% attack and speeding up core development.  No word on a launch date yet  Although the brothers are making progress and the ETF is starting to take shape, it is still too early to talk about a possible launch date.  Cameron Vinklevoss stressed that he could not discuss timing to launch due to strict security laws. “However, identifying the ticker symbol and the exchange are two major events that further demonstrate that we are moving forward as expected,” he added.  Although the Winklevoss ETF remains in regulatory limbo, another bitcoin fund, SecondMarket’s Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT), plans to open to all investors in the fourth quarter of the year.  BIT is not an ETF, however. SecondMarket will effectively circumvent the regulatory process by transforming the BIT into an open fund for public investors. The company still needs approval from Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and OTC Markets, but it does not have to deal with all the regulatory requirements of launching an all new ETF.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/02/winklevoss-bitcoin-etf-to-trade-on-nasdaq-under-coin-symbol,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0e7afa5d9a4a7319e74b408415ea9be49840b0e6-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Galaxia  is one of the top three companies processing online payments in Korea, with more than 10,000 domestic and international websites on its client list.  It is also one of the top mobile gift certificate and voucher sellers in Korea, which may now be purchased with bitcoin as well.  Local bitcoin payment processor and software developer Coinplug will provide technical assistance for bitcoin transactions.  Challenges  Galaxia Communications' Senior VP and COO, Yongkwang Kim, said he first heard about bitcoin last year and keeps his own wallet.  He said, however, there were some challenges convincing others at the company to accept bitcoin, given that news about digital currency ""is not always positive"" and it is not seen as completely reliable.  Since Coinplug will handle processing and exchange, though, in the end there was little problem introducing bitcoin as it will be converted to fiat before Galaxia sees it.  Kim added there were no critical issues or specific challenges to bitcoin implementation on the technical side:  ""We already operate diverse payment options and relatively it feels easy.""  Galaxia and Coinplug  Galaxia Communications is listed on the KOSDAQ (Korea's equivalent to NASDAQ) exchange and is an affiliate of the Hyosung conglomerate.  Coinplug, which produces a number of bitcoin consumer and merchant apps for Android devices and launched Korea's first bitcoin ATM back in March, is one of the companies leading bitcoin adoption in that country.  In April it secured its second $400,000 venture funding round.  The company also announced it will soon launch a new website and wallet platform, including new merchant payment features such as instant buy and sell.
