42377857,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73oMb,1417035634,Usual Suspects Return to Bid in Latest US Marshals Bitcoin Auction,"A second planned auction of 50,000 bitcoins seized by the US government from alleged Silk Road mastermind Ross Ulbricht is attracting many of the same bidders who participated in the June sale of roughly 30,000 BTC taken from the illicit website itself.  Many of the more notable participants from the first auction, including Binary Financial, Bitcoin Investment Trust, Bitcoins Reserve, Mirror (formerly Vaurum), Pantera Capital and angel investor Tim Draper will be taking part once again in the 4th December event.  Although bidders admit that this auction is likely to receive less media attention, many firms are still looking to engage in the event for strategic purposes. The development suggests that interest in bitcoin as an investment opportunity remains high, even as auctions become less advantageous for participants given bitcoin’s maturing market.  Harry Yeh, managing partner at bitcoin-focused investment firm Binary Financial, indicated that interest from his customer base is not as strong as it was this summer.  Yeh told CoinDesk:  “I think since it’s been announced, a lot of people lost interest. People are bidding, but people also realize there are other blocks going on sale.”  As suggested by Yeh, the 50,000 BTC to be offered at auction represents just a portion of the 144,000 BTC originally confiscated from Ulbricht. The USMS has confirmed it will sell the remaining 94,000 BTC in coming months, though no dates have been set.  The money the USMS receives from the auction is still the subject of ongoing litigation, as Ulbricht has previously filed a claim to his holdings, which he alleges he obtained through lawful conduct.  Differing market motives  Yeh went on to note that it’s increasingly possible for high net-worth investors to accumulate blocks of 5,000–20,000 BTC over time, potentially avoiding the premium that can come with buying bitcoin in a competitive bidding process, and through subsequent auctions.  Both factors, he suggested, have dampened investor enthusiasm.  ""You don’t want to be paying a huge premium just to get bitcoins,"" Yeh explained. ""Some people will, but for us, we’re looking to get it at a fair price.""  Mirror CEO Avish Bhama, whose company will use the roughly 30,000 BTC purchased by its investor Tim Draper in the previous auction, told CoinDesk that while it was seeking to gain the ability to offer customers liquidity in the first auction, it is now participating on behalf of its clients.  “For this upcoming syndicate, we're simply making it easy for institutional clients to bid on the coins in a safe and secure way,” Bhama said, adding that Draper will be participating in Mirror’s syndicate.  Public announcements  A small number of participants from the first auction have been more vocal about their involvement in the second auction.  Venture capitalist and serial bitcoin investor Tim Draper told Bloomberg that he intends to bid in the auction, citing the potential for bitcoin as a disruptive technology and the current attractive market price as factors for his interest.  Bitcoin-focused investment firm Pantera Capital as well as Bitcoin Investment Trust and the trading desk at Digital Currency Group – the Barry Silbert-lead entity that will find the entrepreneur separating his bitcoin industry activities from SecondMarket – have both revealed they are accepting applicants to join their bidding syndicates.  Interested participants can contact Pantera by 26th November providing information such as the desired bid size and price; a completed anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) form and a wallet address where any winning bids can be sent.  Further, on 20th November, the Digital Currency Group published a call for participants in its syndicate, asking interested bidders to provide their name, email and phone number to receive more details about the process.  Unknown bidders  Other participants declined to comment for the story or offered no comment, citing the need for discretion given the stakes of the auction.  “We would prefer not to comment for reasons of commercial confidence on this one,” Australia-based bitcoin mining firm digitalBTC said.  Only one prior bidder contacted, the US-based bitcoin e-commerce website Bitcoin Shop indicated that it would not participate in the auction, despite entering a bid this summer.  “We’re going to pass on the auction now, we’ve got some other more important things we’re focusing on,” the company said in a statement.  Bitcoin Shop  has recently been engaged in a strategic rebranding to become an onramp to the bitcoin ecosystem, though this process has not been without challenges.  Both BitPay and Coinbase, the latter of which was revealed in an early, leaked list of potential bidders, declined to comment.

42426190,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjfTh,1417029429,Ferguson Public Library Embraces Bitcoin Donations Amid Unrest,"Amid protests, riots and overall unrest in the aftermath of a grand jury's decision not to indict Officer Darren Wilson for the death of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown, the residents of Ferguson, Missouri, are finding solace in an unlikely place: the city's public library.  Demonstrations in protest of the jury's decision have been taking place all week in Ferguson and around the US, as people in major metropolitan areas across the nation show their solidarity. As a result, many local businesses in the St Louis suburb have closed their doors, and schools in the area have shut down for the week.  The Ferguson Public Library started to receive attention Tuesday for being one of the only local businesses still open to the public, and many who are closely following the situation in Ferguson as it dominates media outlets in the US took to social media to raise funds on behalf of the library.  The power of Twitter  One of the people that used his social media platform to call for donations to the library is prominent venture capitalist and bitcoin advocate Marc Andreessen.  After he sent a tweet directing his followers to donate to the Ferguson Public Library, Tom Kysar from decentralized crowdfunding platform Koinify responded by requesting the library accept bitcoin donations:    @pmarca @fergusonlibrary Need to take BTC. I want 100% of my donation going to them, not MasterCard.      — Tom Kysar (@tomkysar) November 26, 2014    Not long after, the Ferguson Public Library's Twitter account followed up by asking Kysar and Andreessen how it might go about setting up bitcoin donations, joking that its auditor ""will enjoy figuring out BTC next year"".  Following the library's curiosity, payment processor BitPay responded on Twitter offering to help the library set up to receive bitcoin:    @fergusonlibrary@tomkysar@pmarca We can help you right now, can you follow us and DM us... Would love to get you set up tonight — BitPay (@BitPay) November 26, 2014          About three hours later, both BitPay and the library announced that bitcoin donations in support of the Ferguson Public Library had gone live.  An outpour of support  A number of people in the bitcoin community voiced their support for the Ferguson Public Library and its move to accept cryptocurrency donations. Reddit user /u/kysarkoin (presumably Koinify's Kysar, mentioned above) urged redditors to show their support:    ""We have the chance to really show what BTC is all about here. Donations, 100% going right to them. Most places in Ferguson are shut down right now (including the schools), they're open every day running sessions for kids missing school, showers, WiFi, etc. They're also working with the state to help businesses recover with lost documentation / paperwork and get back on their feet.""          Though the Ferguson Public Library sent a tweet assuring bitcoiners that it was currently working out some ""glitches"" earlier today, the library has since thanked everybody who has donated thus far (not only with bitcoin donations), announcing it has received more than 3,000 donations:    Overwhelmed by generosity from around the country. We have received donations from more than 3000 folks! Amazing and humbling! — Ferguson Library (@fergusonlibrary) November 26, 2014            Bitcoin donations to the Ferguson Public Library can be made here through BitPay.

42426181,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjfLh,1417024769,American Red Cross Now Accepts Bitcoin Donations,"The American Red Cross has announced that it will now accept bitcoin through a partnership with BitPay.  Founded in 1881, the American Red Cross is the official US affiliate of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent movement. The humanitarian organisation provides disaster relief and emergency assistance in the US and posted total operating revenues and expenses of $3.4bn for its fiscal year 2013.  In a statement  , BitPay's non-profit outreach leader Elizabeth Ploshay voiced her belief that the partnership would help showcase the generosity of bitcoin consumers to yet another charitable organisation, and by extension, the US public.  Ploshay, who also holds a board member seat at bitcoin's chief trade organisation, the Bitcoin Foundation, said:  ""Bitcoin users are extremely passionate people who are looking to put their bitcoin towards good causes. I’m sure the community will be excited to have such an established charity to donate to.""  The American Red Cross, in turn, suggested that the move would enable it to reach a new demographic of donors.  ""This gives a new generation of supporters the opportunity to help people in need,"" Jennifer Niyangoda, executive director of corporate and foundation programs at American Red Cross, said in an official release.  According to its policies, BitPay does not charge payment processing fees to non-profit organisations, a market strategy also embraced by its largest US competitor, Coinbase.  Black Friday participation  Notably, donations can now be made through a dedicated website established by BitPay.  The website asks users to choose their donation amount in their desired currency. Those who make contributions must also provide a full name, email address, physical address and phone number.  BitPay further announced that the American Red Cross would participate in Bitcoin Black Friday, an annual event aiming to highlight shopping opportunities in the bitcoin space.  The American Red Cross will appear on the official Bitcoin Black Friday website, and the official Bitcoin Giving Tuesday website.  With the move, the organisation joins a number of charities that now accept bitcoin through BitPay, including one of America's most prominent environmental organisations, Greenpeace USA.

42426173,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjf7h,1417013047,Western Union Faces Backlash Over Removal of Spoof Bitcoin Ad,"Western Union has reportedly taken action against a bitcoin spoof of one of its ads, triggering a backlash from proponents of the digital currency.  The parody in question was an image posted on the 'Bitcoin' Facebook page by bitcoin enthusiast Dave Aiello, who also placed it on Reddit. The spoof, which makes a humorous comparison between the price of sending money via Western Union and bitcoin, proved popular among Redditors, who were quick to share the image.  It remains unclear where the parody originated, with Aiello indicating to Ars Technica that he is not the author of the image.  Western Union didn't find the image so amusing, it seems. The money sender filed a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) claim with Facebook alleging the image infringed its copyright, forcing the social networking giant to take down the contentious content.  Aiello told Ars Technica that Facebook had contacted him via email, telling him that the image had been taken down, with an explanation of the issue. The messages were passed on to the tech news site, allegedly identifying Erin Schol, assistant legal analyst at Western Union, as the person who filed the claim.  Western Union told Ars Technica that it takes ""all brand matters seriously"" and takes steps it deems necessary to protect its intellectual property. However, the company's representative did not wish to answer any specific questions on the matter.  The site also reported that Facebook has informed Aiello that the image could soon be reinstated, unless Western Union files an action in a federal court over the image.  Threatened by bitcoin?  DMCA notices are seldom filed against social media content, as parodies are usually considered permissible under the 'fair use' doctrine.  Comment and criticism are additional fair use arguments cited by Redditors, twitter users and authors who covered the takedown. Simply put, using copyrighted material for such purposes, for comic relief, commentary or criticism is normally allowed, otherwise meme makers would have nothing to work with.  The takedown could be seen as Western Union reacting to the perceived threat posed to its activities by the digital currency, which offers as one of its selling points low-cost transfers of funds – although not in practice as cheap as the spoof indicates.  In the end, the DMCA notice may end up being a Pyrrhic victory for Western Union, as the spoof in question might have gone unnoticed by the general public had it not been for the controversy.  Vox described it as an example of the 'Streisand effect', a term that describes how attempts to suppress information in the Internet age often have the exact opposite effect: compelling more people to view and publicise the controversial material rather than less.  In fact, the proof is in the pudding – you are looking at the image right now.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | REGULATION | TRADING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/11/26/western-union-faces-backlash-over-removal-of-spoof-bitcoin-ad,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c33213054e2815cba773ad38e0bff738bedf3fc3-1500x773.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426176,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjf1h,1416999132,Kraken to Assist in Search for Missing Mt Gox Bitcoins,"Digital currency exchange Kraken announced today that it has been chosen to support the investigation of Mt Gox's missing bitcoins, manage the claims process and distribute the defunct company's remaining assets to creditors.  The announcement was made at the second hearing for Mt Gox creditors held today at Tokyo's District Court.  Speaking at a press conference following the hearing, Kraken CEO Jesse Powell said he was ""very humbled for the opportunity to help the community like this"", and that his firm hopes to repair bitcoin's damaged reputation in Japan as much as build its own in the local market.  He said:  ""It's Kraken's philosophy to always put the clients' best interests first, and this is a philosophy that we will carry with us through supporting the trustee.""  There are still many decisions to be made in the process and Kraken has many questions of its own, he further added. The exchange will work closely with the trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi to investigate what happened at Mt Gox as much as possible, although it will not have direct access to Mark Karpeles, Mt Gox's CEO.  'Proven track record'  Kraken published a blog post earlier in the day saying the firm was chosen ""for reasons including its proven track record of stable exchange operation and reliable customer support"", and because it has the skill and expertise required to investigate the losses and look after creditors' interests.  If the Mt Gox bankruptcy trustee decides to distribute any of the remaining bitcoin assets as bitcoin, Kraken will encourage Gox customers to open new accounts with them. Clients will hopefully be pleased with the company's performance and continue to trade there, Powell said.  No plan to revive Mt Gox  Powell reiterated that the main job is to facilitate the liquidation process and redistribute assets to creditors as quickly as possible. He explained that Kraken has no interest in restarting or continuing Mt Gox's business in any form and that that exchange was finished as an entity:  ""There's no code base of any value; the database can't be re-used. The customer database is of dubious value. The reputation is severely damaged. It's become a verb – to be 'Goxed' means to be screwed. The brand name is synonymous with fail.""  Creditors' funds have now been tied up for 10 months and there is no justification in keeping them waiting any longer, Powell continued.  Asked why Kraken is interested in taking on bitcoin's biggest basket case, Powell replied that it is a chance to benefit the wider bitcoin community.  Bitcoin had seen previous messy liquidations – such as Bitcoinica, which ""ended in disaster, and is still ongoing some years later"". The community as a whole had been affected by that.  It is important for trustee Kobayashi's team to have someone reliable and respected within the bitcoin community to guide them through the process this time, he said, and to make sure creditors have a claims process to get as much money back as possible.  Slim hope of finding lost coins  While Kraken would also be tasked with investigating what happened to Mt Gox's missing bitcoins, Powell said it was still unclear if any bitcoins were actually lost, and that it is ""extremely unlikely"" that any will be recovered.  ""I wouldn't hold my breath,"" he said.  The data available is incomplete and even if the bitcoins' current location could be identified, the chances that Kraken will be able to recover them are slim.  Kraken has a contract with specialist data analysis firm Chainalysis to examine whatever data remains at Mt Gox.  A team from local security firm Wizsec has conducted its own extensive investigation into Gox's missing coins over the past months. Powell also said that he hoped to be able to work with Wiz with better access to the database, saying ""the more minds that work on this the better"".  Ultimately it will be up to the trustee, taking into consideration any privacy issues, to determine how much access to data Kraken is allowed.  ""We will make every effort to use the resources available.""  Surprisingly, Kraken will not have direct access to Mark Karpeles, the person who could perhaps give the strongest clues as to what happened in the final weeks of Gox.  A spokesperson said the team will have the opportunity to pose questions through Kobayashi, but that direct questioning might put Karpeles in a difficult position.  Fully compliant exchange  Powell was also asked if Kraken had any experience dealing with organized crime as it related to the bitcoin world.  He replied that as far as he is aware, there have been no cases of organized crime groups working through Kraken. The company adheres to strict KYC-AML procedures, and sets transaction and transfer limits for the different levels of proof of identity its customers supply.  ""I don't think we are by any means an easy exchange to launder money through. I'm sure organized crime groups can find lower hanging fruit elsewhere.""  Some creditors expressed relief that Mt Gox's investigation and liquidation are finally in the hands of people who understand bitcoin and the bitcoin user community.  Creditor Peter Tilley said he was somewhat pleased with today's outcome after the disappointment that followed the previous creditors' meeting in July.  ""As a creditor, I came away from this announcement with a much more positive view of the future. I'm happy to see these guys on the case, as opposed to others who aren't as qualified to handle it.""  Kraken has not worked directly with Mt Gox in the past, although Powell personally intervened, along with Roger Ver, to assist the exchange and save its customers from suffering losses in 2011 when it suffered its first major hack.
