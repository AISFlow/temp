The round was led by Barry Silbert, the CEO and founder of SecondMarket, and tech entrepreneur Jimmy Furland. Silbert invested in the company through his Bitcoin Opportunity Fund. Tribeca Venture Partners, a venture capital firm, also took a leading role as the largest investor in the round. Other investors include Microsoft head of corporate strategy Charles Songhurst, Facebook product lead Ben Davenport and bitcoin industry leader Roger Ver.  ""This financing round places our company in a position to build this highly demanded platform the right way,"" said Jaron Lukasiewicz, Coinsetter's founder and CEO. ""We now have multiple developers working to bring a high-quality product to market, and we have even more people performing security-intensive code reviews on it.""  Coinsetter will soon be launching a forex trading platform for bitcoin that will let people make levered trades on margin and short the bitcoin market.  These capabilities are available in all mature markets but are virtually absent in the bitcoin space, Coinsetter noted in a blog post. The startup also plans to offer the first scalable solution for accredited investors and institutions to earn interest on their bitcoins.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Dan Ilett,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/04/17/500k-in-funding-paves-way-for-bitcoin-trading,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5259412e922e415e5bed313f6839e2e1d63184db-960x960.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424805,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWjjh,1366173129,Bitcoin mining takes 'tiny' energy amount,"Remember how, a few years ago, we were briefly made to believe that all our Google searches were helping to melt the planet? If you recall how that claim was quickly debunked, it should come as no surprise that mining bitcoins might not be as much of an environmental disaster as a few sources have hyped either.  A recent headline in Bloomberg proclaimed that “virtual bitcoin mining is a real-world environmental disaster.” Citing statistics from blockchain.info, Bloomberg writer Mark Gimein warned, “If the dreams of Bitcoin proponents are realized, and the currency is adopted for widespread commerce, the power demands of bitcoin mines would rise dramatically.”  Not so fast. One, points out Nate Anderson of Ars Technica, power estimates for mining are speculative at best. Two, even assuming those numbers are correct, the amounts are “trivial” compared to how much US households use, says Forbes’ Tim Worstall.  Finally, unlike drilling for oil or mining for gold – which will likely continue for as long as humans believe there’s a chance they’ll find more – bitcoin mining has a hard deadline. The last of all 21 million bitcoins will have been mined by 2140.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | FIAT | MINING,Dan Ilett,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2013/04/17/bitcoin-mining-takes-tiny-energy-amount,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5259412e922e415e5bed313f6839e2e1d63184db-960x960.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
