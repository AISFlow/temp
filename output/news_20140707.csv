42377453,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70yrb,1404777247,"OKCoin Releases New, Full-Featured Version of Android App","Beijing-based digital currency exchange OKCoin has launched a new version of its Android app it says will offer users full trading features anywhere they go.  The company describes it as ""the first full-featured mobile app from a bitcoin exchange"", with many features from the full desktop site.  The release comes just two weeks after OKCoin also added more sophisticated algorithmic tools to its main site aimed specifically at high-volume traders.  An iOS version of the app is also currently going through the Apple approval process.  Market and price data  The app will feature real-time market data from the main site, including up-to-date price information and 24-hour volumes from all major exchanges on one page.  Candlestick charts mean users can monitor market trends in easy-to-read format, and set price alerts for market movements on any major exchange.  Bitcoin and litecoin  Users can deposit BTC and/or LTC into their accounts at any time using provided QR codes and addresses, and can place market and limit orders from anywhere.  A 'tap-to-buy' feature also allows them to simply tap on any current order in the order book list and fill the price field with that price.  OKCoin says this will allow speculators who watch every price movement to never miss an opportunity, even when out and about.  Security  An extra layer of security protects against coin theft if the device is lost or stolen, allowing users to set up a gesture-based password on top of the normal character-based one.  OKCoin said of the new version:  ""This latest update reaffirms OKCoin’s position of dedication towards improving user experience and offering as many features as possible.""  International competition  OKCoin, like other large Chinese exchanges, has made a concerted effort this year to appeal to international customers as well as mainland Chinese traders with improved feature sets and more sophisticated mobile apps. To that end, the app is available with an English language interface, as well as Chinese versions.  Competition has been fierce in the space, with the companies having to battle on multiple fronts against the government, banks and each other while at the same time trying to attract venture funding.  OKCoin announced in March it had secured over $10m from local companies associated with prominent Silicon Valley investors.

42377443,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70ymZ,1404770114,Next Bitcoin Core Version to Include 'Smarter' Transaction Fees,"Bitcoin Foundation Chief Scientist Gavin Andresen has outlined the details of new floating transaction fees to be included in the code of the next Bitcoin Core release.  In a new post on the official Bitcoin Foundationhttps://bitcoinfoundation.org/2014/07/07/floating-fees/ blog, Andresen stated that the updated code will enable “smarter” fees that account for the length of time it takes to confirm transactions on the bitcoin network. Ultimately, the new code will determine transaction priority, making sure that transactions confirm more efficiently.  Andresen cited needless complexities within bitcoin’s transaction fee code as the reason for the update. These complications result in inconsistent and time-consuming confirmation periods.  He wrote:  “Instead of using hard-coded rules for what fees to pay, the [new] code observes how long transactions are taking to confirm and then uses that data to estimate the right fee to pay so the transaction confirms quickly – or decides that the transaction has a high enough priority to be sent for free but still confirm quickly.”  Furthermore, the new code enables transaction senders to configure how much priority they want their transaction to receive. In some cases, users may opt to have as many as six blocks pass before the first confirmation is received.  Systemic fee problems addressed  Currently, the Bitcoin Core code can lead to headaches for those who send large bitcoin transactions. As Andresen explained, the new code eliminates some of the hurdles that slowed down transactions in excess of 1,000 bytes in size.  Transactions sent for free also run into problems under the existing framework. The code that determines priority for free transactions automatically places them at a disadvantage in the network. This results in a significant increase in confirmation times.  Andresen wrote:  “The current situation is even worse for free, high-priority transactions: the hard-coded ‘high-priority’ constant is much too low, so transactions sent for free can take a very long time to confirm.”  By making changes to Bitcoin Core, Andresen said, users can rely on more effective transaction fee determinations within the bitcoin network.  Future updates possible  Andresen went on to dismiss the idea of small, fixed transaction fees, citing the behavior of miners – and their preference for high-fee transactions – as reasons to avoid such an approach. Notably, he said there was no desire within the bitcoin development community to institute fixed fees.  Fees should rise in the future as miners sign and confirm larger transaction volumes in the months and years ahead, he wrote:  “I expect to see transaction fees rise until a good solution for optimizing the propagation of blocks across the network is deployed, because I expect transaction volume to increase and I don’t think miners will include more transactions in their blocks until somebody fixes the 'bigger blocks take longer to broadcast' problem.”  Ultimately, he concluded, developers need to tackle this problem and develop new code that enables a more efficient and healthy transaction process.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | TECHNOLOGY,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/07/next-bitcoin-core-version-to-include-smarter-transaction-fees,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1339b81a0e40a48038c3741975bc4d8ced71080d-959x547.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377441,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70yk3,1404763832,"French Officials Seize $272,800 From Illegal Bitcoin Exchange","French police have seized 388 bitcoins from a bitcoin exchange operating illegally in the country. The coins are worth roughly €200,000 (or $272,800) at current prices.  Three were arrested in Cannes, Nice and Toulouse on suspicion of operating a website that illegally sold and lent bitcoin to its registered users. Sources said a retired policeman tipped off the financial authorities when he bought bitcoin at the exchange.  The prosecutor in the investigation Olivier Caracotch said that this is the first European case in which judicial action has brought on the closure of an illegal virtual currency exchange, adding:  ""It's also the first time in France that bitcoins have been seized as part of a judicial procedure.""  The parties in question are the site’s administrator, his wife and one of the site’s suppliers. One of the suspects has since been released from his detention, while the other two were presented to a judge and placed under judicial supervision. They are being examined on potential charges of illegal banking, money laundering and operating an illegal gambling website.  The French authorities also confiscated credit cards, computer hardware and €9,000 in cash.  Currency of the criminals  At least 2,500 bitcoins totalling more than €1m were transacted in at least 2,750 exchanges on the site between November 2013 and July 2014. The website was unapproved by the Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de resolution, the body responsible for supervising the banking and insurance sectors, the police said.  “Like all virtual currencies,” they told Le Point, “it has a high risk of criminal abuses taking into account, on the one hand, the opacity that surrounds their existence and operation and, on the other hand, the complete absence of regulation by money market participants.”  La Maison du Bitcoin founder Eric Larchevêque rebutted that comment and said the news is unsurprising since gambling in France is so heavily regulated:  “From our point of view, it confirms that bitcoin is not the ‘dream currency of the criminals’, as police investigations succeeded to shut down the operation in the same way they would have done with euro-operated activities.”  Bitcoin in France  La Maison du Bitcoin is France’s first bitcoin centre. It opened in April, several months after the country’s central bank issued a warning against the volatility of bitcoin, stating that it does not pose a threat to financial stability, but poses risks for those who choose to invest in it.  That same month, the Ministry of Economy and Finance issued guidance outlining that bitcoin is not considered legal currency in line with France’s monetary and financial code, however income from cryptocurrency transactions could still be taxed.

42377429,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70yYj,1404756929,ISIS-Linked Blog: Bitcoin Can Fund Terrorist Movements Worldwide,"The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has proposed using bitcoin to fund global jihadist efforts.  A blog post entitled 'Bitcoin and the Charity of Violent Physical Struggle' outlines a use case for bitcoin as a vehicle for terrorist financing, noting that its pseudonymous transaction capability fits well within the needs of jihadist organizers. Its author claims to be connected with the Islamic State, the so-called jihadi nation established by the ISIS leadership.  The concept that bitcoin could be used to help fund terrorists has been a long-standing concern among law enforcement and government agencies worldwide. Indeed, many restrictions placed on the use of digital currencies stem from these concerns.  According to the blog post, originally reported on by Sky News, bitcoin makes it difficult for anti-terrorist financing authorities to stop transactions from taking place. Services such as DarkWallet were specifically cited as methods for making bitcoin payments between terrorists even more untraceable. The blog author noted that bitcoin presents tax evasion benefits as well.  The blog states:  ""This system has the potential to revive the lost sunnah of donating to the mujahideen, it is simple, easy, and we ask Allah to hasten its usage for us.""  Notably, the article cites Silk Road as an example of how bitcoin can be used to procure weapons, sell drugs and engage in other illegal activities that support terrorism.  Avoiding detection  Terrorist funders may find bitcoin and other digital currencies attractive owing to the broad supervision and monitoring of the global financial system. Specifically, in the post-9/11 world, many governments actively watch for suspicious money movements.  By using bitcoin, ISIS and other organizations could circumvent legal barriers that keep money away from terrorists. The digital currency’s borderless transaction capabilities and avoidance of major money conduits make it a logical fit for terrorists – and a likely target for law enforcement officials concerned about this exact application.  The blog author wrote that, as a result of anti-terrorism financial restrictions and cooperation between governments on these efforts, jihadist funding has all but dried up. Only the wealthiest supporters are able to contribute by using traditional currencies and payment methods.  However, bitcoin presents a hard-to-trace option for terrorism funding, the ISIS paper continues. As well, block chain-based smart contracts may be used to support jihadist efforts.  The blog post concluded:  ""This allows our brothers stuck outside of the ardh Dawlatul-Islam to avoid government taxes [and] secretly fund the mujahideen with no legal danger upon them.""  Call to utilize DarkWallet  For terrorist groups like ISIS, the appeal of bitcoin lies in the ability to mask transactions – or at least hide them amidst the broader movements of the bitcoin network.  The potential use of bitcoin to fund terrorism is being actively investigated by a number of government agencies, including the US Department of Defense.  The article specifically calls for ISIS to use DarkWallet as a platform of funding, saying:  “DarkWallet’s beta release will be published within the next coming months, the mujahideen of Dawlatul­ Islam would simply need to set up a wallet and post their wallet address online. Then, Muslims from across the globe could simply copy the wallet address, login to their [wallets], purchase whatever amount of bitcoin they wish to send, and send them over.”  CoinDesk reached out to the DarkWallet development team for comment but did not receive an immediate response.  By citing DarkWallet specifically, the blog highlights potential avenues for terrorist financiers to use freely available bitcoin services. Beyond bitcoin, there are several altcoins that present potential applications of transaction anonymizing technology that could be leveraged to fund terrorism.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/07/isis-linked-blog-bitcoin-can-fund-terrorist-movements-worldwide,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3211c8046e3777aa4d78fcfef25cf69090f9600b-901x520.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377446,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70yin,1404749864,New Zealand Central Banker: Cryptocurrencies Could Supplant Cash,"Geoff Bascand, deputy governor and head of operations at the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) has said that digital currencies could one day evolve to supplant cash as we know it.  In a recent speech delivered to the Royal Numismatic Society in Wellington over the weekend, Bascand described digital currencies as a “challenge to the form and provenance” of money.  He outlined a number of advantages associated with digital currencies, along with the more or less usual list of concerns and risks.  Advantages and drawbacks  Bascand said digital currencies like bitcoin were created as an alternative means of payment and store of value, adding:  “[Bitcoin] is a very low cost payment method with strong security features and usable for cross-border transactions, making it advantageous in some regards relative to more traditional payment mechanisms.”  However, he also noted that cryptocurrencies still have a number of drawbacks, with few businesses accepting them as a form of payment and price volatility remaining a concern.  Bascand went to on explain how, if certain conditions are met, digital currencies could replace normal money:  “Key attributes of trust (that the 'money' gives rise to settlement of the obligation) and anonymity (it is often efficient for the sale/purchase parties not to have to identify one another) must be met, but if these can be accomplished reliably and sustainably, new technologies could supplant cash as we know it in years to come.”  Banks need to keep up  Bascand argued that central banks do not need to be overwhelmed by such innovations. Instead, they need to keep track of developments in the field and develop their regulatory and currency operations roles accordingly.  In this way, he said, they will manage to keep up with developments in technology and the evolving needs of the public.  Both the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and the Reserve Bank of Australia issued digital currency warnings late last year. Apart from the carefully worded statement, regulators have taken any measures to curb or control the development of the bitcoin economy in the region.  Australia's bitcoin business scene in particular seems to be thriving, and one company even launched on its stock exchange in June.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/07/new-zealand-central-banker-cryptocurrencies-could-supplant-cash,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fa7bb80749c7448691a3eafeea1365a3fd8a8669-1024x576.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377434,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70ybF,1404742389,Leaked Documents Suggest Mt. Gox Paid $200k to Parent Company in May,"Controversy surrounds a leaked report that bankrupt exchange Mt. Gox paid almost $200,000 in fees to its parent company, Tibanne K.K., after the exchange had filed for bankruptcy.  According to documents posted on the website goxdox.org, Tibanne, the web services company also owned by Gox CEO Mark Karpeles, and which shared the same office space, invoiced Mt. Gox on 26th May for ""services rendered"".  Those services included office rent, server fees and employee expenses. However, according to a Reuters report in March, Mt. Gox had no other full time employees besides Karpeles and everyone else worked on a one-year contract basis.  Trustee approved  The two Japanese-language invoices from May were approved for payment from Mt. Gox's remaining assets by the court-appointed bankruptcy trustee, Nobuaki Kobayashi, and were issued during the company's civil rehabilitation timeframe. As trustee, Kobayashi has exclusive power to administer and dispose of Mt. Gox assets.  In other alarming news, the documents, if genuine, reveal Mt. Gox's remaining funds total only $7.6m – significantly less than the $38m in assets claimed in its bankruptcy application.  Additionally, a physical mailout to creditors notifying them of proceedings also allegedly cost $85,000, even though the information had already been posted on Mt Gox's website.  These funds were not part of the 200,000 bitcoins recovered from what was described as an ""old style wallet"" after an initial 850,000 BTC went missing in an apparent hacking attack at some stage before February. The recovered bitcoins are worth roughly $125m on markets today.  Frustration for community  The expense reports were met with disbelief from Japan's bitcoin community, many of whom lost money when Mt. Gox collapsed and some of whom lost six-figure dollar equivalents.  The news is sure to raise tensions at a creditors' meeting scheduled for 23rd July in Tokyo, amid other reports Karpeles himself will attend.  There are rumors Karpeles himself is broke. A Wall Street Journal interview last month revealed he is still living in his Tokyo apartment and struggling to keep Tibanne operating with its remaining contract employees.  Karpeles indicated he also trying to sell other assets belonging to the firm, among them some lucrative domain name properties including bitcoins.com.  There are still two groups in consultation with the court to try and return creditors' money by restarting the Mt. Gox business and operating it once again as a bitcoin exchange.  They are Sunlot Holdings’ 'savegox.com' campaign and another group formerly backed by Chinese exchange OKCoin and its Tokyo-based partners.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/07/leaked-documents-suggest-mt-gox-paid-200k-to-parent-company-in-may,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/73282fc845b4034825b5e0b3d8e2deb4fcc2dbef-1361x709.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397737,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbE39R,1404733291,"16,500 Retweets for Cash in Support of Ross Ulbricht","UPDATE (7th July 23:17 BST): This article has been updated with comments from Roger Ver.      Just two days ago, Bitcoin magnate Roger Ver offered to donate $10 for every retweet of his message supporting the Free Ross Ulbricht campaign – which aims to support the man allegedly behind defunct online drug market Silk Road. Now, Ver has announced that the donation limit has been reached.  Ulbricht was arrested last year on serious charges relating to the government closure and seizure of Silk Road. However, Ulbricht maintains his innocence and insists he did not violate US law.  Following his arrest, Ulbricht’s family created FreeRoss.org to campaign and raise money for Ross’s defence. The family is trying to raise $100,000 for the cause and Ver’s assistance looks likely to have taken them well past their target, as well as raising further awareness in the process.    I’ll give $10 to @Free_Ross for each RT. If guilty, he’s a hero. If innocent, he needs help. http://t.co/XwhqrN06UT pic.twitter.com/Oau4dkFvdV      — Roger Ver (@rogerkver) July 5, 2014    At press time, the message had already been retweeted more than 16,500 times, with Ver further tweeting within the last hour that his donation limit has been reached:    Amazing support for @Free_Ross https://t.co/DyCFsnDMpv More retweets welcome, but the donation limit has been reached. #Silkroad #Bitcoin      — Roger Ver (@rogerkver) July 7, 2014    Defence prepares  In his original tweet, Ver notably linked to an Ulbricht statement dated 21st June to be read at the recent Porcfest 2014 event, organised by The Free State Project.  In the message, Ulbricht, though careful with his words for legal reasons, remains defiant and indicated that believes the criminal justice system can be beaten:  “One thing I’ve learned since beginning my tour of the federal criminal justice system is that these guys are not all-powerful. They can be beaten and precedent can be set that will limit their ability to infringe on our rights.”  Ulbricht urged his supporters to stand by him and to do what they can to “turn this horrible situation into a win”.  In response to people who questioned why he considered Ulbricht a hero if guilty, Ver said:    ""I think that each individual owns their own body, and has the absolute right to put whatever they want into it. The police, judges, and jail guards who lock people in cages for ingesting substances without the permission of strangers, are the ones committing evil and need to stop.""      ""If Ross Ulbricht is DPR and helped facilitate the these voluntary interactions, he is a hero for helping provide the technology that allowed peaceful people to ignore the violent threats from strangers calling themselves politicians and law enforcement.""    ""If Ross is falsely accused, and was not DPR, then he deserves the best defense money can buy. Either way, he deserves the support of anyone who is opposed to the war on drugs.""    Serious charges remain  Although Ulbricht still enjoys support support in some circles, he is facing serious charges, some usually reserved for participants in organised crime.  Ulbricht was indicted in February  and pleaded not guilty soon after. If convicted, he could face life behind bars – the charge of 'continuing criminal enterprise' adding a minimum 20 years to his sentence.  The government alleges that Silk Road generated more than $1bn in annual sales and that Ulbricht was its ringleader.  Ulbricht’s family have explained that the defence argument centres on freedom of speech, more specifically on the Communications Decency Act. In an interview with CoinDesk, the Ulbrichts argued that the law shields Internet platform providers from liability against the criminal actions of their users.  On that basis, the Ulbrichts believe a conviction in the case against their son could curb Internet freedoms and freedom of speech, as it would set a precedent that could affect any service provider or website that hosts third parties, by making them responsible for the actions of their clients.

42397743,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbE3FL,1404731477,"CoinJelly Exchange to Offer Debit Cards, 'Bank-Level' Services","A new exchange and wallet service based in Australia and Hong Kong says it is building 'bank-level' services around bitcoin, designed to appeal to both serious traders and everyday travelers.  CoinJelly  will launch two exchanges for high-volume traders, initially for the Southern Hemisphere and then soon after, the Northern. Notably, its consumer wallet option features an ATM/debit card network for use worldwide.  In perhaps its most novel approach, though, the company claims it has insured its bitcoin ecosystem against loss for up to AUD$20m ($18.7m), or 20 BTC per customer.  Accounts will be open to customers in 160 countries and balances available in nine major world currencies, including Russian rubles and Chinese yuan.  Building trust  CEO and founder Ashley King said security, compliance and transparency were CoinJelly's biggest issues, in order to build trust with those yet to adopt bitcoin who might have been put off by high-profile failures in the past.  The firm follows other exchange launches in the region with a new focus on professionalism and financial services aimed at serious investors.  CoinJelly's wallet is now launched and live, and its exchange has been under development for 4-5 months. According to King, there have been no security breaches or attempted intrusions as yet.  King said:  ""We’ve implemented a number of bank-level passive and active safety measures including strong encryption, offline back up and two-factor authentication, leaving customers’ wallets far less vulnerable to attack.""  CoinJelly’s insured wallet also offers an intrusion alarm system, which identifies possible malicious activity and reacts automatically to head off fraud and attack.  ATM/debit cards  CoinJelly will also be providing ATM/debit cards for customers to easily cash out their bitcoins, and is in the process of finalizing merchant accounts.  The cards are aimed primarily at travelers as an affordable and easy way to transfer funds into local currency worldwide.  If the ATM/debit card plan sounds familiar, it's because CoinJelly purchased some of the related merchant connection code from defunct Cypriot 'bitcoin bank' and debit card network Neo & Bee.  This will enable customers to purchase cards from CoinJelly's site, load the cards with bitcoins (thus effectively selling them to CoinJelly) and then spending the fiat amounts on the cards like any other bank debit card.  The cards may also be used to withdraw cash at over two million ATMs worldwide.  A limited-edition black-colored card will be available to the first 500 customers and will also offer discounted rates for life.  Insurance and security  CoinJelly approached an insurance company about wallet guarantees, but it was only after company representatives were provided a copy of the software to experiment with that they were able to make an agreement.  Security is handled through in-browser encryption of private keys, and the company does not have any access to bitcoin balances.  Customers may also schedule a personal visit to CoinJelly's head office in Brisbane for an extra layer of assurance.  International focus  CoinJelly's development team is divided between Australia, Switzerland and Sweden.  To build liquidity around launch time, King and his team have spent most of the past six weeks traveling the world talking to traders to find out what they want, particularly fee structures and special promotions such as fee-free days.  They have signed up about 15 large North American traders already, including some that King describes as high-profile names, and he said the company now has enough volume to trade about 1,500 BTC daily.  Non-traditional markets  CoinJelly will be accepting accounts from Russia and even mainland China, where users can fund accounts through CoinJelly's bank in Hong Kong.  ""Until instructed otherwise we'll continue to do so. Obviously we don't want to step on anyone's toes, If we're told to stop doing it, we'll stop doing it.""  Coinjelly's financial operations are currently being managed from Hong Kong, intended as a temporary solution until regulation and compliance issues are resolved in other nations like Australia.  ""We're going to have a nice little ecosystem, we're going to have a really good wallet and a great exchange, initially tiered towards high-volume guys, but once we open the Northern Hemisphere exchange the bigger guys will probably switch to that.""  Sole investor  Aside from the money used for initial funding, CoinJelly is financed solely by investor Peter Anderson, who made his fortune in the early days of the Internet economy.  He said he was drawn to bitcoin more for its disruptive potential than any desire to speculate on its value and that CoinJelly was the first project he thought worthy of such investment:  ""[Ashley King's] solution was the first one I'd come across that fit my ethical standards as well as the overall approach to the community – customers rather than users. He has a really grown-up approach. Which is something that's missing in other offerings.""  Banks, he said, had grown lazy due to being the default means for moving money around the world, rather than offering any real value. This was especially true of the forex market, he indicated.  ""Crypto coins will blow a hole in that laziness. They're going to have to compete. There's long-term value for consumers here who are happy to look a bit deeper.""  While compliance issues would likely raise the cost of doing business in the bitcoin space, Anderson said, it wouldn't be as high as banks often claimed.  ""Cost of compliance is a tremendous excuse for banks and other institutions to jack up fees,"" he said, adding:  ""Trouble is, they jack those fees way past the [true cost] of providing that compliance. And given my career has been in and around that area, it has always annoyed me.""  Disclaimer: This article is not an endorsement of the company or companies mentioned.
