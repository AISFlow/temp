42405421,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMQDo,1605302642,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Fails to Reach $16.5K; Wrapped BTC Hits $2 Billion,"Analysts are bullish on bitcoin’s price but the options market is decidedly bearish on the remaining weeks of 2020. Ethereum’s wrapped bitcoin token crosses $2 billion locked.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $16,240 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 0.30% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $15,971-$16,487  BTC above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price trended up for the third straight day, hitting as high as $16,487, according to data from CoinDesk 20. It dipped somewhat since hitting that level and traded at $16,240 as of press time.      “Bitcoin rose significantly above the $16,100 mark. Buyers pushed the price due to the large volume,” noted Constantin Kogan, managing partner at investment firm Wave Financial.      Major exchange daily spot volumes on Friday were at $668 million as of press time, but not close to Thursday’s $1.1 billion in volume.      George McDonaugh, managing director at investment firm KR1, highlighted a key difference between the price run-up in 2020 versus the mooning that occurred back in 2017. “Bitcoin has spent 0.32% of its life at $16,000 and above, which means there were relatively very few buyers at that level back in 2017,” he told CoinDesk. “This correlates to there being very few sellers at this level now, meaning there isn’t a strong resistance band for the bulls to push the price higher.”      “I’m seeing an increasing demand from more traditional family offices making their first investments into bitcoin as a long-term hedge or as insurance for their existing portfolio of investments,” Michael Gord, chief executive officer of Global Digital Assets, told CoinDesk. “I expect this trend to continue as bitcoin keeps maintaining its value and being uncorrelated to most other asset classes.”      Read More: $300M BTC Flow to Binance From Huobi as China Toughens on Exchanges      Bitcoin isn’t entirely uncorrelated from other asset classes like equities, but lately the correlation between the world’s oldest cryptocurrency and the S&P 500 has dropped a little bit.      KR1’s McDonaugh is expecting bitcoin’s price to reach $20,000, but it might take some time to get there as some profit-taking is likely to ensue. “$20,000 is a far more psychological barrier, so it is likely to be ‘HODLers’ – people holding bitcoin forever – that may de-risk at that level and produce some selling pressure,” he said.      Bitcoin options traders aren’t fully convinced that it will trade at $20,000 in 2020. The probabilities calculated using December expiration have pegged only a 16% chance of $20,000 bitcoin, a 29% for $18,000 and a 39% of $17,000 according to data aggregator Skew.      Nevertheless, analysts project that bitcoin can soon surpass at least $16,500 consistently. “Given market sentiment and current trends, I am still bullish on BTC,” said Andrew Tu, an executive at trading firm Efficient Frontier. “Though we may range between $16,000 and $16,500 for a bit before breaking resistance.”    Wrapped bitcoin hits $2 billion locked    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Friday, trading around $470 and climbing 2.6% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Read More: Payments Provider BitPay Rolls Out Cryptocurrency Payroll Service      The amount of bitcoin “locked” in the Ethereum-based wrapped bitcoin contract passed $2 billion Thursday, and is staying at that level Friday. In order to use bitcoin on Ethereum, it must be “wrapped” and used as a token on the network using a standard called ERC-20.      Brian Mosoff, chief executive officer of investment firm Ether Capital, says the parking of bitcoin on Ethereum is giving the network a huge leg up over its up-and-coming smart contract competitors, including Polkadot, Cardano and Cosmos, among others.      “It's proving that Ethereum is the thing everyone is plugging into and (networks like) Polkadot may not have its day in the sun,” Mosoff told CoinDesk.    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly green Friday.

42405413,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMQ5w,1605292205,Token Projects Are Not Happy With KuCoin's Handling of $280M Hack,"The latest face-saving communique from Seychelles-domiciled crypto exchange KuCoin – hacked almost two months ago for over $280 million – is that 84% of the affected assets have been recovered. Some victims will be glad the situation seems to be moving towards resolution. Others, not so much.      Leaving aside the conspiracy theories, death threats and alleged lack of communication on the part of the exchange, the KuCoin debacle raises troubling issues around blockchain decentralization and how token projects often rely on fallible intermediaries.      Following the hack, many projects whose tokens were stolen from the exchange were urged to react quickly and change their smart contracts – effectively replacing stolen tokens with new versions, known as a token swap. (A list of projects that speedily updated their tokens following the Sept. 26 hack can be found here.)      The majority of ERC-20 projects affected by the KuCoin hack (around 60%) have bowed to pressure and upgraded their tokens. While it goes against the principles of those projects to essentially cover KuCoin’s back by updating their smart contracts or replacing their tokens, they chose the easiest solution available to them. But in some cases, it’s not a straightforward process and would lead to a very messy fix.      Read more: KuCoin CEO Says Suspects in $281M Hack Identified; Authorities on the Case      “We consciously built our smart contract in a way that’s truly decentralized and we, as a team, can’t just halt transactions, blacklist, whitelist people and so on,” said Paul Claudius, co-founder of DIA, a crowd-driven Wikipedia for financial data and information. “As a team, we obviously trust ourselves, but we don’t think the world should have to trust us. And that’s the reason we build our smart contracts that way.”      KuCoin calls all remediating efforts “token swaps,” said Claudius, but the exchange is confusing two different things.      In some cases, it’s possible to upgrade the contract, reissue the token and create a blockchain state similar to that prior to the hack. That’s very different from a situation where reissuing the token would create two tokens.      “Then it’s like a fork,” said Claudius. “Which is the real token at the end? People would be trading the old token, not knowing this. It’s just not an option.”      In the case of DIA, some 3 million tokens were taken by the hacker, at a value of around $4 million; while this amount was not “life-threatening,” the team members had to watch powerless as the hacker sold their tokens.      “I can see why projects who had, say, 50% of their tokens affected by the hack, would choose the option to basically just pull the plug,” Claudius said. “Their backs were against the wall.”      Read more: Decentralized Governance in the Wild – Lessons From the KuCoin Hack      The DMM Foundation, the organization behind Decentralized Money Market, said KuCoin’s strategy has been to switch the onus onto the decentralized governance communities behind these projects, pressuring them to swap tokens, effectively crediting KuCoin’s balance.      “This leaves the community in an uproar, asking why we are not upgrading our token, when in fact it shouldn’t be our responsibility; it’s actually KuCoin’s problem,” a member of DMM, who wanted to remain nameless, told CoinDesk, adding:      “We are a DeFi protocol. We can’t do that so easily without completely disrupting our user base and potentially exposing areas of weakness for our community.”    Token quandary    It’s one of the paradoxes at the heart of crypto, that decentralized projects list on centralized exchanges and must rely on centralized custody as a potential point of failure.      Of course, that’s why decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are becoming increasingly popular as technological advances bring speed (and, in turn, attract liquidity for prominent tokens). For some smaller projects, though, listing on KuCoin is a big deal. Perhaps it is their only trading venue with significant liquidity. So what are they going to do?      Read more: Ocean Protocol Forks to Retrieve Tokens Stolen From KuCoin Exchange      There are a number of projects that are holding out from doing a token swap, and KuCoin’s strategy seems to be to wait until they all eventually fold. During this waiting game, the exchange has employed some egregious tactics, said Jag Singh, CEO of Vid, a project that delisted from KuCoin before the hack took place.      “We delisted from KuCoin because we noticed a lot of suspicious stuff going on with our token price – pumps and dumps – that we concluded could only be [caused by] the exchange itself,” said Singh. “This [delisting] meant they had less leverage over us.”      Like many others affected by the hack, Singh claims KuCoin is selling phantom tokens. If the entire balance of a token was stolen by the hacker and that project has not done a token swap, KuCoin is “trading on thin air,” Singh said. He claims this is a deliberate tactic to induce token swaps and reduce the amount the exchange has to reimburse.      CoinDesk asked KuCoin for comment, to which the exchange asked for questions to be emailed. There has been no response to the questions but a KuCoin representative did share some comments from KuCoin CEO Johnny Lyu comparing the hack to events like the Ethereum DAO compromise of 2016.      “Actually, in the history of crypto, token swap or hard fork situations emerged several times among Bitcoin and Ethereum communities at critical timings,” Lyu said in a live-streamed update on Sept. 30. “With that, communities survived from serious crises, and everyone felt thankful to those teams that made contributions.”      The irony and hypocrisy of such comparisons is stunning, said Richard Sanders, founder of blockchain analytics company CipherBlade.      “The important thing is that we’re dealing with decentralized tech,” said Sanders. “So setting a precedent every single time an exchange is hacked or somebody is negligent for some centralized action goes against the very foundation of what this technology is supposed to be about. Everything KuCoin is doing really boils down to them trying to save face.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | TRADING | KSC | FORKS,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/11/13/token-projects-are-not-happy-with-kucoins-handling-of-280m-hack,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/246b8a16186507f6fe1cabb4c1b2d2ac899614ab-2000x1333.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Cred’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing doesn’t tell the whole story. With $67.8 million in assets and $136 million in liabilities, the crypto lender called it quits last weekend, leaving hundreds of depositors worrying about their collected $100 million loaned to the company. Cred has officially blamed malfeasance on the part of an outside investor entrusted with 800 BTC, although corporate insiders also say a $39 million line of credit to a Chinese lender went south. “There’s a lot else going on,” Daniyal Inamullah, former head of capital markets at Cred, said. CoinDesk’s Nathan DiCamillo investigates.      Bleeding BTC? Two publicly traded bitcoin mining companies are nearing profitability. Marathon and Hut 8, prominent within the sector, both narrowed quarterly losses, according to quarterly financial statements. Marathon bumped revenues to $835,184 in Q3, a 160% increase from the same period last year, while also recording a net loss of nearly $2 million. The company’s loss per share, however, dropped from 12 cents to 6 cents a share year over year. Meanwhile, Hut 8 saw C$5.3 million (about US$4 million) in Q3 mining revenue, down 43% from the previous quarter, but also managed to trim its losses of C$0.07 a share in Q3 2019 to C$0.01 this quarter.      CBDC 'hunch' European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has a “hunch” there will be a digital euro in two to four years. At a virtual panel yesterday, Lagarde said an European Union-wide central bank digital currency should be explored, “If it is going to facilitate cross-border payments.” The ECB previously said it is researching a CBDC. The latest statements are another indicator of what to expect and when: “A digital euro will not be a substitute for cash,” Lagarde said. “It will be a complement.” Separately, Benoit Coeure, head of the Innovation Hub at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), said any potential CBDC for the supranational bank could involve blockchain. “Everything is possible,” he said.      Audited and attacked Decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Akropolis suffered a $2 million loss following a sophisticated “flash loan” attack. According to the platform’s founder Ana Andrianova, the attacker pulled out tranches of $50,000 in DAI from the project’s yCurve and sUSD pools, leveraging derivatives platform dYdX. While much is said about the audit trails of novel DeFi protocols, especially after hacks, Akropolis’ code was in fact audited twice: once by CertiK and also by firms SmartDec and Pessimistic.      Exchange flows Bitcoin flows to Binance from Huobi have reached an all-time high. According to data provided by CryptoQuant, some 18,652 bitcoins, worth nearly $300 million, were transferred from Huobi to Binance from Nov. 2 to Nov. 11. The bustling trade spiked ever since the Huobi chief operating officer, Robin Zhu, went missing at the beginning of the month.

This follows other corporate firms like MicroStrategy and Square moving some of their cash treasuries into bitcoin, also citing monetary debasement.      “The expansion of the money supply in the U.S. hasn’t shown up in growth of CPI in a measurable way, but in other measurements of inflation,” Gutmann said. Notably, Gutmann considers the prospect of living a “dignified” retirement as an ideal marker for inflation.      “The idea of financial security is much broader in bitcoin,” he said, when claiming that only a “single-digit number” of fiat monetary systems are functional or scale. “Can I save my day’s labor in something I can spend tomorrow next week,” isn’t a question most U.S. workers are confronted with, but it may be a legitimate concern elsewhere.      That’s why a bitcoin-based world economy could better serve nations that weren’t part of the industrializing processes of the 19th and 20th centuries.      Gutmann further explained NYDIG’s thesis is in fostering the “long-term development of an open source monetary system.” This includes opening some of its in-house bitcoin infrastructure up to other companies – “we won't be the last people that have this challenge” – and applying for New York State’s “BitLicense '' and a limited trust charter.      “To the extent we can move the bitcoin project forward, it feels like we can do something measurable in society today around this idea of financial security for people outside the first world,” he said.

42405408,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMQ20,1605289927,Developers Debate Disclosure Protocols After ‘Accidental’ Ethereum Hard Fork,"Ethereum developers are weighing changes to publicly disclosing critical bugs following the Nov. 11 ""accidental hard fork.""      According to a technical write-up published by Geth – the largest Ethereum client written in the Go language – a denial-of-service (DoS) attack vector was intentionally triggered by a downstream user as a test, resulting in a 30-block minority chain.      Geth had fixed the bug in early October following a disclosure, but it still existed in prior versions of Geth. The bug temporarily caused nodes that had not updated to the correct version of Geth to go down a different path than other clients.      Now, developers are reordering the disclosure process for security vulnerabilities in the aftermath of what some developers have called the biggest threat against Ethereum since 2016’s attack on The DAO.      Read more: ‘Unannounced Hard Fork’ Was Trying to Prevent the Very Disruption It Caused      That question comes with baggage. A common ethos in open-source software (OSS) such as Ethereum is that vendors are tasked “to notify those affected by vulnerabilities in a timely manner,” Summa founder James Prestwich told CoinDesk in a message. In other words, Geth has a responsibility to give dependent users a heads-up on possible complications, he said.    'Disclosure is a complex topic'    Yet, blockchains, at their very core, are financial settlement mechanisms. The traditional methods of disclosing bugs in OSS can lead to undesirable outcomes for other players with money on the line.      In Friday’s All Core Developers’ call, Ethereum developer Micah Zoltu and Geth team leader Peter Szilágyi both disagreed with the issuance of a notification list for critical vulnerabilities. Zoltu claimed such a list would create an uneven playing field for projects, while Szilágyi said that every bug disclosure creates a weak point in Ethereum’s infrastructure.      For example, disclosing the bug early to service provider Infura – which most of decentralized finance (DeFi) uses to connect to the Ethereum blockchain – would be an unfair advantage against its competitors. Moreover, the consequences for the larger ecosystem could be severe if privileged information from the list leaked to adversarial parties.      Given the option again, Szilágyi said he would go about the recent disclosure in the same manner – meaning, keeping the consensus bug under wraps (although he said at one point during the call they should have let users know a past version of Geth held a vulnerability). Geth has done so for other consensus vulnerabilities, he said.      “Disclosure is a complex topic and user safety is paramount,” Prestwich concluded.      Update (November 13 21:00 UTC): A prior version of this article incorrectly stated that 80% of the network went down the wrong chain. Only nodes that had not updated to the correct Geth version joined the minority chain.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | FORKS,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/11/13/developers-debate-disclosure-protocols-after-accidental-ethereum-hard-fork,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/230fba2e7910113af5a88a5dc6f2e5cb3bfd729c-2560x1854.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42405419,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMQBq,1605288991,Money Reimagined: The US' Kodak Moment,"In the lore of digital disruption, Eastman Kodak Co.'s downfall looms large.      Kodak was once one of the world's most powerful companies. But it failed to act on digital cameras and online photo sharing, despite seeing the trends years before. (Kodak engineer Steve Sasson created the first digital camera in 1975.)      It's an apt story to remember now as the digital money revolution rolls ahead at a time of momentous political transition. An incoming U.S. presidential administration faces an analogous situation: knowledge of what is happening but, currently, a lack of will to act.      Does China’s digital currency pose a threat to U.S. global economic leadership and the dollar’s dominance? Are U.S. leaders acting as Kodak’s were thought to have, with their heads rammed into the sand?      CoinDesk columnist JP Koning’s answer to that would be, “No. Relax.”      Last week, Koning wrote that because central banks enjoy a de facto monopoly in domestic currency usage, they need not fear disruption by China’s or any other country’s monetary innovations, which means central bankers can afford to wait and learn from the first-movers’ mistakes before launching their own digital currencies. The dollar is doubly safe, he wrote, because “what glues everyone to [it] is a combination of an incredibly powerful banking vortex in New York City and America’s massive economy, not the medium on which dollars are printed.”      This assumes global currency markets are the only gauge of the competitive advantage China gets from its Digital Currency Electronic Payments (DCEP) system. It would measure success solely by the unlikely event that masses of people outside China will replace their highly liquid, universally accepted, reliably legal dollars with the currency of a closed, single-party Communist state.      But as a deep-dive report into the DCEP by Indian think tank Policy 4.0 shows, the real competitive, disruptive power of the digital yuan’s lies in how its programmable features will enhance the Chinese economy.      As China integrates this unique, peer-to-peer form of software-based money into networks of interconnected digital devices, it will extract vast benefits in economic efficiency, monetary policy effectiveness and data-gathering capacity. Also, by allowing it to bypass that New York banking vortex, the DCEP will ultimately give China something money can’t buy: total autonomy.      All of that poses real challenges to the U.S.    Crickets...    Where does projected President-elect Joe Biden stand on this? It’s not clear.      In a Foreign Affairs essay this week that laid out his plans to restore U.S. leadership of a world facing a litany of challenges, Biden made no mention of China’s digital currency.      He’s not unique in his silence. No candidates in the presidential primaries made public statements about China’s forays into digital currencies and blockchain technology.      This is not to say people in power aren’t thinking about these issues. In a “currency war games” simulation at Harvard last year, Gary Gensler, a crypto-savvy former Commodity Futures Trading Commission chairman who was named this week as Biden’s head financial regulation adviser, joined former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and others to explore the threat foreign digital currencies pose to U.S. interests.      Still, the topic doesn’t naturally foster political urgency. U.S. dominance of the global financial system, and the unique international gatekeeping powers that come with that, have been in place so long that most people in both government and business take it for granted as a given.      Many in the crypto community have their heads in the sand, too. It’s true China’s government-led DCEP and blockchain services network go against the decentralized principles of bitcoin. But so what? Whether we like it or not, China’s moves could massively transform the world of money. We must all sit up and take notice.    An economic growth engine    Does this sound familiar? In 1990, it was hard to imagine billions of camera-touting consumers would find a new filmless means of capturing images.      How might China, wielding the monetary equivalent of a digital camera, give the U.S. its “Kodak moment”?      Well, to start, the DCEP will give China a stronger, faster economic recovery from the COVID-19 crisis than the U.S, by allowing for targeted, programmable monetary stimulus, with cash disbursements directed to certain people for prescribed uses only and not, for example, to the shadow lending industry the authorities have struggled to contain. Although the history of Communism tells us that sustained, centrally planned credit ultimately leads to poor resource allocation, in the immediate term this targeted approach will be far more effective than the Federal Reserve’s blunt quantitative easing tool. This, in turn, means China’s future debt burden could be more manageable than that of the United States.      Inserting programmable money into an internet-of-things-powered decentralized economy will also give China a powerful economic advantage. It will facilitate distributed energy markets, smart cities, “industry 4.0” production plants and resource-efficient “circular economy” systems.      With DCEP, China’s supply chains will become hyper-efficient, giving it a big advantage over other countries’ production sectors. And as those models extend into China’s international One Belt One Road initiative, foreign dependency on its production processes could grow, giving Beijing geopolitical clout.      Out of this, China will forge financial autonomy. Its digital currency will eventually be interoperable with other tokens and blockchains, allowing its businesses and their foreign trading partners to move money across borders without using dollars as an intermediary. They’ll bypass New York, in other words.    Solution: Open money    This won’t happen overnight. But the effect on confidence in the U.S. could arise within the next four years.      How should Washington react? Christopher Giancarlo, former CFTC chairman and the founder of the Digital Dollar Foundation, is pushing for a digital dollar that would integrate constitutionally enshrined privacy protections, making it more appealing than the digital yuan, which many fear will become a Beijing surveillance tool.      But will people truly trust the U.S. not to monitor digital dollar transactions? After all, as Jennifer Zhu Scott, chair of the Commons Project, noted in this week’s Money Reimagined podcast, global finance is already subject to a comprehensive U.S.-led system of surveillance.      So, while we’re right to worry about a Chinese “panopticon” ingesting people’s identifying information, that’s not the data threat the U.S. can or should compete with. In the same podcast episode, Policy 4.0 CEO Tanvi Ratna said the bigger issue is how troves of DCEP-generated anonymized data will enable Chinese businesses to extract huge efficiencies and unlock innovation across decentralized economic systems.      There may be a way for the U.S. to compete here. But it will require a radical, disruptive solution.      The answer is that Washington must embrace and encourage an open money system, a world of interoperable, freely accessible open-source tokens and blockchains – everything from a digital dollar to bitcoin – and encourage innovators to use and build new products on top of them.      We know from the internet that open systems will beat closed systems in powering innovation.      And while this approach fits the traditional U.S. stance on competition, market liberalism and free trade, it represents an existential threat to China’s ruling Communist Party.      The problem is that if Kodak struggled to kill its then-lucrative film business in the nineties, it’s hard to imagine the U.S. giving up the drug of dollar supremacy.

But given that we’ve just come out of the most contentious and divisive U.S. presidential election in living history, I thought this was worth exploring. It offers a meta theme about data visualizations generally, which are a common element of how cryptocurrency and blockchain information is presented.      The way we understand our world and the decisions we make about it can be greatly influenced in this digital age by how data is presented. The images below offer a reminder that all those visualizations are merely abstractions of reality and that, in the act of abstracting the data and giving a format and context that we believe is meaningful, something gets lost. But it also speaks to how creative re-renderings can offer additional context to make things clearer.      The first part of this animation from data visualizer Karim Douieb (republished by the New York Post) is probably familiar to anyone who was glued to TV news and political websites for the preceding days. It shows the county-by-county vote result across the U.S., with solid versions of Republican red and Democratic blue showing confirmed results and the lighter versions showing who has the lead at that time. It’s familiar because maps like this always look far more red than blue.      But land doesn’t vote. People do. So, given that population density differs so dramatically across the country, using standard two dimensional maps of geographic area to display something about the choices of humans in those places is inherently misleading. The unit of accounting for a vote tally is a person, not an acre of land.      Here’s where simply adjusting the context by adding another dimension to the measurement makes a difference. So, in the second image we see each county represented by a bubble whose size is determined not by its area but its population. Not surprisingly, there’s a lot more blue.    Global town hall    SAME OLD, SAME OLD. If there’s one elephant in the room bigger than China’s digital currency, it’s the internet’s core problem of centralized data and content control. So, it’s disappointing to read in the MIT Technology Review that, although a Biden presidency is expected to continue with the Department of Justice’s recent lawsuit against Google, any attempts to address the core problem are going to be very limited.      We all know something’s wrong with the excessive clout wielded by big internet firms, but almost every demand to address the problems attacks the symptoms, not the cause. In effect, in recognizing the unique power these firms have without tackling it, these actions just reinforce their status. There’s very little discussion of the underlying reality that the business model employed by social media platforms like Google, Facebook and Twitter is one of surveillance capitalism.      We, the humans in the system, are essentially mined for data and then subjected by algorithms to attempts to modify our behavior in the service of advertisers. That makes the ambiguity of the social media firms’ legal status so important to resolve. Section 230 treats them as platforms rather than publishers, so they are exempt from defamation and other liability for third-party content, but it simultaneously affords them the right to remove, highlight, rank and generally curate the content as they see fit. That’s possibly well intended, and without that balance we wouldn’t have services like Wikipedia. But when you combine the unique power that this duality affords the big internet firms with the abuse of privacy and data-mining that feeds the most successful business model in history, something has to give.      One solution lies in government supporting developers that use technologies such as blockchain to enable more decentralized business models. That way, content creators and audience are empowered to meet each other without the platforms’ intermediation and without their data being exploited by a centralized middleman. The problem is, how do you get people to leave the communities to which they currently belong and migrate to one that far fewer people use?      An alternative solution lies in legal action and/or legislation that either breaks up the platforms’ monopolies or regulates them as utilities. This would require nuanced dealings with freedom of the press issues and to distinguish, subjectively but fairly, between harmless platforms and those that have too much power. Which is the best route is open to debate. We just need to actually have the debate. For that, we need to see the elephant in the room.      A CYPHERPUNK-IMAM ALLIANCE. This development in Europe scares me. It’s also one that, ironically after the last item, finds me on the side of tech firms. Government intelligence agencies want to prevent hardware providers and apps from encrypting information and want backdoors to users’ messages. The efforts have rightfully met with stiff resistance from firms protecting their users’ privacy. Yet, as the Bloomberg story says, government officials can often find public support as people fear terrorists and other bad actors.      Now, as a number of European Union governments promote a resolution calling for “technical solutions for gaining access to encrypted data,” the debate is swerving into dangerous issues of religious freedom. It seems the backdoors that law enforcement want are aimed at Muslim leaders and communities in growing backlash against Islam following recent Islamic terrorist attacks on the continent. Mixing data surveillance with religious targeting seems like a slippery slope to me.      This creates an interesting alliance. The strongest advocates of digital privacy and the right to encrypt messages are the cypherpunk communities from which Bitcoin emerged – not exactly bedfellows with Islamic imams. But such is the cross-section of interests privacy rights covers.      It’s also relevant to the money debate. Encryption enables peer-to-peer communication without a third-party intermediator, and money transactions are just another form of communication. So this ultimately goes to the heart of the battle that Bitcoin was created to fight – for the right to censorship resistance.

With the planned initial public offering of his giant fintech company Ant Financial, Jack Ma was set to become the 11th-richest man in the world, leapfrogging the heirs to L’Oreal’s and Walmart’s fortunes. But then, surprisingly, the IPO was shut down by the Chinese government. Now, as David Pan reports, it seems clear the Chinese government attacks on Ant Financial are directly connected to its digital yuan project, which is partly motivated by a desire to restore government control over payments, money and banking.

42433114,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO3DPh,1605281417,This Crypto Custody Breakthrough Will Bring Banks Closer to Digital Assets,"Stealth-mode crypto custody specialist Shard X has claimed a breakthrough, being the first company to successfully run math-heavy, multi-party computation (MPC) on hardware security modules (HSMs).      So why does this alphabet soup of security tech matter?      In summary, HSMs are a battle-tested way to store private keys, particularly popular in consumer products like Ledger and Trezor. MPC, which breaks up cryptographic keys into shards and distributes them, is growing in popularity with custody tech providers like Fireblocks and Curv. But one challenge with MPC has been where to store key shards: The whole process was thought to be too computationally heavy to run on hardware.      Solving this problem is important because banks, which are gradually edging towards crypto custody, generally like and trust HSMs. So a combination of battle-tested, bank-grade HSMs, combined with cutting-edge MPC is probably the type of tech those institutions will be looking for, says Yaniv Neu-Ner, co-founder and CEO of Shard X.      Read more: MPC Explained: The Bold New Vision for Securing Crypto Money      Shard X has successfully run MPC tests with Entrust, a provider of nShield HSMs to major custodians, said Neu-Ner, and is now working on running MPC with a number of firms offering HSMs, such as Utimaco.      “Our big breakthrough is that we’ve managed to compress and optimize the MPC code so that it can run on bank-grade HSMs, something people in this space never thought was possible,” said Neu-Ner. “Now, you can take an MPC key fragment and store it on an HSM to make sure you don’t get breached.”      Wallet providers, custodians and exchanges all need bank-grade security for crypto-wallets and to secure and manage multi-million dollar assets across multiple blockchains, said John Grimm, VP strategy and business development at Entrust.      “ShardX has implemented multi-party computation (MPC) technology on Entrust nShield hardware security modules (HSMs) to ensure the integrity and secure processing of private key fragments that protect the blockchain, offering high assurance secure key management and a secure, safe and simple way to access digital currencies,” said Grimm via email.      There are a lot of smart people working on MPC, so how did nobody else solve this problem?      Neu-Ner said the credit goes to his team, which managed to combine equally strong math and engineering backgrounds, in particular his CTO Nikita Lesnikov.      “[Lesnikov] is just an exceptional mind,” said Neu-Ner. “He was the one who figured it out. I imagine now that we are announcing it, the competition will start working on the same challenge, and I think they will get there. But it’s a big breakthrough to be first.”      Read more: Coinbase Ventures Joins $23M Funding Round for Crypto Custody Firm      Shard X likes to take a back seat, licensing its software to custodians. In terms of how this breakthrough is being peer-reviewed, MPC code auditor Trail of Bits has been selected to continually audit the work.      For Neu-Ner, a combination of the best of both worlds is an essential step in the evolution of crypto custody.      “As this industry grows, there’s going to be more and more value at stake, and right now we are seeing exchanges getting hacked fairly regularly,” he said. “So I don’t think one technology will be enough. The future I see is that you combine multiple technologies to create the most secure custody solutions.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/11/13/this-crypto-custody-breakthrough-will-bring-banks-closer-to-digital-assets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a1c165147ee1964b2f9c486772fa5ba610804a53-2000x1257.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433119,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO3DRh,1605278087,"From PayPal to Libra: Big Tech Has Forced Central Banks to Wake Up to CBDCs, Says Benoit Coeure","Libra was the final wake-up call for central banks that prompted serious consideration of digital currency issuances, according to Benoit Coeure, head of the Innovation Hub at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).      In an interview with French newspaper L'Express published on the BIS website Friday, Coeure acknowledged central banks had been resting on their laurels when it came to advances in payments. Thirty years ago, he said, ""the banking world was innovative.""      But increasing digitization and the advent of tech such as PayPal, Apple Pay and smartphones payments brought a ""revolution"" to the sector. Even so, he continued, these advances were restricted to the user interface and didn't offer a fundamental disruption to payment channels.      According to Coeure, the ""real trigger"" for the move toward central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) was the unveiling of the Facebook-initiated Libra project, which offered more than just an advance in the user interface.      ""[Libra] is a global, closed and self-sufficient project since there is at the same time a means of payment, a storage mechanism with a wallet and a global network which makes it possible to ensure transfers from one place to another without going through the central bank settlement systems,"" he said.      Acknowledging the project offers benefits to users, Coeure also cautioned that ""the emergence of closed payment channels dominated by tech giants poses risks for both competition and data protection.""      Even so, as the public increasingly moves away from cash and online transactions soar (""especially with the COVID"" pandemic), ""we can see the figures, it is impressive.""      ""Central banks must rethink their software and review their role in this new environment,"" he said.      Citing a recent report published by the BIS along with seven central banks, Coeure said, ""We must move forward on digital currencies, which are part of the solution"" although individual nations should proceed at ""their own pace.""      Also read: ECB’s Lagarde Has ‘Hunch’ Digital Euro Will Launch in 2-4 Years      As to whether such a launch would be on a blockchain, the technology is ""not mandatory,"" he said, raising the prospect of hybrid solutions in which ""relations"" between central banks and the commercial banks would use a blockchain but a digital currency would be available to the public ""through more traditional channels.""      ""Everything is possible,"" he said.      In a recent op-ed for CoinDesk, Coeure revealed the BIS Innovation Hub would launch its first wholesale CBDC proof-of-concept in collaboration with the Swiss National Bank. ""This will pave the way for experiments on the building blocks of a retail CBDC, which might include interlinkages with existing payment systems, application programming interfaces for distribution, digital identity rails,"" and more, he said.      In his interview with L'Express, Coeure said one day a CBDC will be ""the safest currency there is, issued by a public institution,"" but there will be other options, too.

Gold strengthened 0.1% to $1,879 an ounce.    Market moves    Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has been sticking with his talking points lately. It goes something like this:    What the economy needs right now is for U.S. lawmakers to pass a fiscal stimulus package because ostensibly that money can go directly to people and businesses that need it most. (Instead of having to pump it into financial markets where it has to filter through the banking system and money markets before it can get to pocketbooks.)  The path of the economy depends on the path of the coronavirus pandemic. (Investors seem to agree, based on yesterday's action in the U.S stock market.)  This year's economic contraction was not due to excessive risk but simply the pandemic and related effects, such as shutdowns. (Even though analysts had been warning for years about ballooning federal budget deficits and a rapid and dangerous buildup in corporate debt.)  The banks are stronger than they were in the 2008 financial crisis. (This ignores the question of whether they would still be strong if the Fed hadn't pumped $3 trillion into the financial system this year, a roughly 75% increase in the total amount of money created since the early 20th century, while the U.S. government plied businesses and households with another $2 trillion of emergency aid. Plus the fact that Fed officials have promised to do whatever it takes to keep markets functioning and the economy recovering, encouraging households and businesses to flood banks with deposits despite historically low interest rates.)  U.S. authorities shouldn't hasten to rush out a digital dollar, because it's important to go slowly and carefully to preserve the greenback's status as the global reserve currency. (Even though China's central bank is already in trials with a digital currency and European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde says she might be eager to get the process started because it will take two to four years until launch.)    They're all key themes cryptocurrency traders are following because a growing number of investors say extensive money printing could bolster bitcoin's use as a hedge against inflation.      But what was perhaps more interesting and new among Powell's comments at a virtual forum Thursday hosted by the ECB was his acknowledgement that life as we know it – and by extension the economy – is probably never going back to anything like it once was.      ""You'll see more telework,"" Powell said at the virtual forum. ""We're not going back to the same economy. We're recovering to a different economy.""      It was more than just a talking point. It might have offered a glimpse into a key issue that Powell hasn't said much about. The coronavirus will have a lasting and scarring impact on the economy, but remote working might be another massive factor to consider for monetary policy.      The economy is in upheaval, and not just because people aren't eating out or going to movies or traveling for leisure, or because so many businesses and households would be ailing right now without all the emergency aid.      A secular transition to commuting-by-Internet might be taking place, perhaps one of the biggest labor force transformations since the industrial revolution, which lured people to cities.      If workers genuinely enjoy the remote setup, and many do, and employers are genuinely seeing just how productive their employees can be working remotely, and it costs a lot of time and money to commute, and it's easier on many working parents to set up base at home, why would there ever be a return to the old office-based civilization?      What would this mean for the airlines? Commercial real estate? Oil companies? Automakers? Theme parks? Cities?      Governments and central banks are probably going to have to provide a lot of aid and stimulus to assure the transition goes smoothly, that society holds together, that people can manage. And that widespread debt defaults don't overwhelm the banking system. Even many people who think bankers take advantage of their enshrined role in the economy will acknowledge that banks play an essential role in the existing financial infrastructure.      Dave Hendler, principal and founder at the bank analysis firm Viola Risk Advisors, says one implication is that the hand of governments and central banks could be heavy in the economy for a long time.      He said in a phone interview he recently trekked from the New York suburbs into Manhattan for the first time since February for a wine-tasting event. While he was in town he visited his old barber. The barber, who has ""one kid and another on the way,"" told Hendler he's down to one customer a day from a pre-pandemic level of about 20 a day.      Imagine if many of the office workers never really come back. It's an extreme but entirely plausible scenario.      ""It's going to be a longer readjustment, and it's going to be more harsh,"" Hendler says. ""There's going to have to be assistance for the transition to the new world.""      Central bankers like Powell are only just now getting around to thinking about this, much less talking about it. As soon as more investors start to focus on it, the remote-working economy will probably demand a lot more attention – and possibly a lot more money.      - Bradley Keoun    Bitcoin watch    Bitcoin appears to be holding above $16,000, and cryptocurrency traders are pondering the next move.      The big market debate now is if and when bitcoin returns to the record high price of around $20,000 reached in December 2017.      George McDonaugh, managing director and co-founder of the publicly traded cryptocurrency investment firm KR1, wrote Friday in emailed comments that he doesn't expect bitcoin holders to sell until prices reach a new record, ""given the comparatively small delta between $16,000 and $20,000.""      Bitcoin has been known to surprise in the past with pullbacks that punish overly bullish bets. Alternative.me's Crypto Fear & Greed Index has pushed into the ""extreme greed"" zone, from a reading of ""neutral"" just last month.      ""I expect we don’t reach $20,000 in this current move,"" though it's likely to happen in 2021, McDonough wrote.      As noted last week by First Mover, bitcoin has spent so little time above $16,000 in its 11-year history that analysts eyeing price-chart patterns for clues have little to work with.      Matt Blom, head of sales and trading for the digital-asset financial firm Diginex, wrote Thursday that the next key level of price resistance looks to be at $17,130, with downside support at $15,420.      ""New multi-year highs are fast becoming a dull headline,"" Blom wrote. ""The bias to the market is still firmly bullish.""      Bitcoin is now up an astounding 127% in 2020, versus 9.5% for the Standard & Poor's 500 Index of large U.S. stocks and 24% for gold.

42433117,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO3DVh,1605265200,$300M in Bitcoin Flow to Binance From Huobi as China Gets Tougher on Exchanges,"As the Chinese government cracks down on several crypto exchanges catering to traders based in China, many of those customers – and their bitcoin – have been making their way to Binance over the past few days.      Bitcoin flows to Binance from Huobi reached an all-time high since the Huobi chief operating officer, Robin Zhu, allegedly went missing on Nov. 2. According to data provided by CryptoQuant, a total number of 18,652 bitcoin, worth nearly $300 million, was transferred from Huobi to Binance from that day until Nov. 11.      “A lot of users went to Binance because Chinese users are more familiar with Binance and Binance’s executives are all overseas,” Colin Wu, a Chinese crypto reporter behind the Twitter account @WuBlockchain, told CoinDesk on a WeChat message.      A spokesperson from Binance declined to comment on any impact China’s crackdown could have on its business.      For months, Chinese regulators have been clamping down on many crypto trading platforms that cater mainly to Chinese clients. Some of these exchanges appear to have close, albeit informal, relationships with the Chinese government.      The whereabouts of Huobi’s Zhu remains unclear since rumors began circulating in early November that alleged he was arrested by “local officials.” Prices for Huobi Token (HT) dropped to as low as $3.744 on Nov. 3, down 11.3% from $4.22 on Nov. 1, according to Messari.      Over at rival exchange OKEx, with deep ties to China, all withdrawal services remain suspended after it said a holder of a private key needed to authorize withdrawals was out of touch while cooperating with public security investigators in China. OKEx’s native token OKB lost nearly 30% of its market value after the news broke.      Other exchanges are also feeling the heat. On Nov. 9, the person running TokenBetter, another crypto exchange with mostly Chinese users, was reportedly “under investigation.” TokenBetter’s platform banned its withdrawal service on Oct. 16.      This is not the first attempt by the regulators in China to crack down on crypto exchanges. Bitcoin exchanges received orders to close their businesses in China after the country banned crypto trading activities in 2017.      Huobi is now based in Seychelles, while OKEx is in Malta. It is unclear where Binance’s main business operations are located – Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s chief executive officer, told CoinDesk his company’s locations are “decentralized.”      Huobi did not answer CoinDesk’s question on where Zhu is currently, but in a WeChat message Ciara Sun, vice president of Huobi Global Markets, wrote that all operations at the company are “normal.”      “Do not listen to rumors,” she continued. “Huobi reserves the right to pursue legal responsibilities for those who spread rumors.”      Many have associated OKEx’s lost contact with one of its key holders with the arrest of its co-founder Mingxing “Star” Xu. With Huobi’s executive allegedly being arrested, its users are afraid the same things will happen to the Seychelles-based exchange – even though Huobi has guaranteed its users many times it is maintaining normal operations.    China tightens its grip in FinTech    Multiple sources close to OKEx and Huobi told CoinDesk the new crackdown is associated with China’s efforts to fight money laundering and fraud, and it is unlikely to have any connection with China’s rollout of its central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital yuan.      “[China] doesn’t want digital [renminbi] products to be disruptive to what’s already in the financial system,” Felix Wang, managing director and partner at financial investment research firm Hedgeye, told CoinDesk in an interview. “The government wants to encourage innovation and development. They only want to crack down on products that they think are misleading to the public.”      Crypto exchanges are not the only target of the Chinese regulators in recent months. Perhaps the most well known case was Ant Group’s initial public offering, which was suspended on both the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges after the company’s founder, Jack Ma, criticized China’s regulators in a speech on Oct. 24.    Is there an upside?    A possible, positive, long-term outcome of the crackdown for exchanges could be that it may encourage the regulators in China to eventually push some sort of a compliance process for crypto exchanges instead of banning them, according to Hao Wang, founder and chief executive officer of Hong Kong-based crypto brokerage CyberX.      “Most of these lost users from Huobi will eventually flow to the white-label exchanges because most traders [in Asia] do not currently have access to trading platforms with regulatory compliance,” Wang told CoinDesk in a WeChat message.      Nonetheless, as China increasingly tightens its grip on its fintech industry, others are also concerned that it will hurt the fintech industry as a whole – blockchain included – as such companies expand their business overseas.      “The sentiment is very bad for all countries outside of China looking to do business with China at this time,” Wang said.“People got worried when [China] introduced those micro financial regulations. They are thinking now this is going to be part of a little step of a bigger crackdown on fintech, finance-related payment and maybe blockchain.”",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | BNB,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/13/300m-in-bitcoin-flow-to-binance-from-huobi-as-china-gets-tougher-on-exchanges,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3e77276f4cec82882f47ea5fd41345f482b5d4d6-1500x1116.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

BitPay Send lets companies perform a variety of payment functions including payroll, customer cash-out requests, contractor payments, reward issuance and settlements with marketplace sellers.  Recipients need to have a BitPay ID and cryptocurrency wallet in order to receive payment and companies are charged a 1% fee. There are no foreign exchange fees.  With the launch, BitPay now provides an alternative to crypto payroll services such as BitWage.  BitPay launched in 2013 with a focus on enabling businesses to accept payment in bitcoin and has raised $72.5 million to date in investment, according to Crunchbase.
