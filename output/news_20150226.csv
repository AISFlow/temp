42378024,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LumR,1424983844,"Ex-Goldman, Paribas Execs Launch Bitcoin Derivatives Exchange","A new bitcoin derivatives trading platform called Crypto Facilities has launched in London, backed by a pair of co-founders with longtime experience in the City's traditional financial markets.  Crypto Facilities  currently lets customers trade just one instrument, a forward contract on the bitcoin price. It currently offers the contract with three expiry dates. A trader can lock in the price of a bitcoin by selling or shorting a forward.  The platform's pedigreed co-founders are Timo Schlaefer, a former executive director at Goldman Sachs in London that worked on credit quantitative modelling, and Jean-Christophe Laruelle, who formerly built trading platform systems for BNP Paribas and Societe Generale.  Schlaefer is coy about his Goldman experience, saying that he isn't comfortable discussing his history at the firm. He said, however, that he left his role there in order to work on Crypto Facilities full-time.  ""I left [Goldman] to do this, basically,"" he said. ""It is not something you can just start with two weeks of preparation time.""  Schlaefer's contacts in high finance have come in handy, as he courts institutional traders who want to get involved with cryptocurrencies, although he wouldn't confirm if any professional investors are trading on his platform, citing client confidentiality.  Growing derivatives space  Crypto Facilities is launching in a still nascent bitcoin derivatives market. Some 806 contracts have been traded for the March forward and about 550 contracts traded for both forwards with later expiry dates, which Schlaefer said he considers ""pretty liquid"".  Perhaps the best known cryptocurrency derivatives issuer is TeraExchange, which is registered with the US derivatives regulator. It made waves last September with its own bitcoin forward, which it touted as the first bitcoin-linked instrument to be traded on a regulated platform. TeraExchange doesn't publish its bitcoin forwards volume data.  Hong Kong-based BitMEX is another, run by former finance professionals, that has worked to introduce a range of novel instruments to the digital currency space. Among these is a 'fear index' for bitcoin, which tracks the digital currency's volatility and allows traders to make bets on its movements.  Growing trading volumes on derivatives exchanges should eventually translate into more stable bitcoin spot prices, says Colin Kwan, a former business analyst of futures and options at UBS who is now chief operating officer at leveraged trading provider BTC.sx.  ""Just like the traditional markets – going back to wheat and gold – because of the volatility of the weather and things like that, it made commerce very unstructured. It was simple derivatives like forwards that actually normalised the market,"" he said. ""When you start talking about big sums of bitcoin, big movements, then derivatives will reduce volatility and provide a lot more efficiency.""  Rush to regulation  Crypto Facilities joins other newly launched UK exchanges in attempting to get under a regulatory umbrella even as the regulatory regime in the jurisdiction remains in flux.  The new exchange's strategy is to use the services of a ""regulatory host"", a company that complies with the rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the UK financial regulator. The host, a firm called Met Facilities LLP, is registered as a financial services firm with the FCA.  In turn, it has made Crypto Facilities an appointed representative, meaning it has to ensure the crypto exchange complies with the FCA's rules. If there's a breach in conduct by the crypto exchange, the host gets the blowback from the regulator.  But the arrangement is, to some extent, marketing on the part of Crypto Facilities, since bitcoin doesn't fall under the FCA's purview, a fact that Schlaefer readily acknowledges.  ""Bitcoin forwards are not part of the regulated activities per se ... What we do is apply the same risk management and compliance framework [to bitcoin forwards trading],"" he said.  A London exchange launched last month, DSX, uses a similar arrangement, except the same management team runs both the regulated entity and the crypto exchange. Another exchange, LazyCoins, successfully registered with the UK tax authority as a Money Services Business in a bid to come under official scrutiny.  Bhavesh Kotecha, a managing partner at Met Facilities, said his firm has received enquiries from about 10 cryptocurrency firms seeking 'regulatory hosting' services in the last year, suggesting that this may prove to be a popular route to regulation for UK firms.  For Schlaefer, a bitcoin derivatives platform is just the first iteration of what he hopes will be a long involvement in digital currencies:  ""Bitcoin is a special realisation of the blockchain technology ... Whatever the new use of the blockchain technology will be, it's probably going to be some crypto asset, some sort of virtual asset. If you have a framework for how to trade this asset, how to hedge risk and so forth, I think that's quite valuable.""

42378042,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Lv6Z,1424974547,Commonwealth Secretariat Commissions Bitcoin Report for Developing Nations,"A two-day event that brought together representatives from the Commonwealth Secretariat has ended with agreement that member states draft a formal report on virtual currencies.  The main intergovernmental body behind the Commonwealth of Nations, the Commonwealth Secretariat represents 53 states, mainly in the developing world. The final report will be presented at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting to be held in Malta from 27th to 29th November.  A spokesperson for the organisation provided further details of potential subject matters the report might discuss, telling CoinDesk:  “At the end of the two days, representatives of member governments issued a set of recommendations – these included preparing technical guidance for member states on effective legislative, regulatory and criminal justice responses to virtual currencies.”  Reports from the organisation itself indicate that the Virtual Currencies Round Table saw representatives from 10 member states present a variety of views on the subject of bitcoin and digital currencies over its two-day run.  A representative from Singapore, for example, explained that the country’s approach has been one of embracing new technologies, including bitcoin, while a representative for India reportedly described the technology as “very concerning”.  The official summary suggests all members recognized the need for “a broad range of legislation” to “prevent the exploitation” of digital currencies and related technologies.  The agency declined to release the formal recommendations formulated at the meeting, cautioning that discussion is “still in very early stages”.

42378047,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Lv95,1424970232,CoinSpark 2.0 Taps Blockchain Tech for Notarized Messaging Service,"CoinSpark has released a new version of its protocol that allows users to send private messages tied to bitcoin transactions, effectively allowing its technology to be used for more commercial, notarized transactions.  The second major update from the asset transfer protocol launched in September, CoinSpark 2.0 will enable a broad range of applications based on the ability for two parties in a bitcoin transaction or asset transfer to record its purpose.  Gideon Greenspan, CEO and founder of Coin Sciences, the company behind the platform, described the upgrade as a way to provide bitcoin with the capabilities of more traditional payment systems such as PayPal and SWIFT when it comes to facilitating commerce.  Greenspan explained:  “Every payment system has a way to attach information with payment, so if you’re sending money, you have the opportunity to explain if this is payment for a contract or it’s investment in a company. That’s kind of necessary or the recipient might not always know what the purpose of a transaction is, and that’s something that’s always been missing from bitcoin.”  To begin using the service, users can download the CoinSpark’s SparkBit wallet, which will support the new interface beginning today, while those running the bitcoin core client can use CoinSpark's open-source code to add the functionality.  Enterprise users who may want to integrate CoinSpark 2.0 into their products also have the ability to take advantage of the project's programming libraries, available in six languages.  Private messaging  Greenspan explained that, rather than encoding a direct message into the bitcoin transaction’s metadata, CoinSpark 2.0 instead places a hash of that message and the address of the server from which it needs to be retrieved in this field.  This, in turn, means that only the hash of that message, not the message itself, is visible to the public.  The feature will, however, enable public broadcasting, allowing those who want messages to appear in bitcoin’s public ledger to do so, though the feature will be optional.  “The message itself is not visible on the blockchain, the only people who can see it are the sender, the server that delivers that message and the recipient who has to sign a request to that server, so it’s not visible to the rest of the world,” Greenspan said.  The flexibility, Greenspan said, would also allow users to provide non-commercial messaging, should it be used for more general purposes.  “This is a contextual note,” he continued. “So, if you gave me money for coffee last week and I’m paying you back, it’s a way for user A to send a message to user B in connection with a transaction.”  Pushing boundaries  Though more specific in its applications, Greenspan indicated he sees CoinSpark 2.0 as “a step in the direction” of the larger movement to use the bitcoin blockchain as a way to facilitate messaging.  For example, he suggested an email application could be built that would enable people to message each other on the blockchain in a notarized fashion, all with “infinitesimal” amounts of bitcoin.  “The purpose of the use wouldn’t actually be for enhancing bitcoin transactions, but just notarizing communications. When you read about the blockchain, one of the things that keeps coming up is that it could be used to make email more secure, and this is essentially just a practical way of doing that,” he added.  However, he cautioned that transactions on its network are tied to bitcoin, and therefore do incur a cost, meaning that it would be useful for the kind of general audience messaging services being built on bitcoin such as GetGems.  Wider applications  Still, Greenspan indicated that CoinSpark 2.0 is in some ways a necessary move, one that will help his platform compete for relevance against the other asset transfer protocols striving to unlock similar use cases.  Overall, Greenspan described asset transfer as an application that has yet to really take hold in the market. “I don’t see a lot of things being issued over these protocols that are breaking out in terms of being really useful for mainstream use,” he said.  Further, he cautioned that this transition is likely to “take a long time”, and that this is why CoinSpark is taking a more varied approach to its products. But, he noted that user growth is happening as evidenced by the growing number of bitcoin transactions that include metadata.  Greenspan concluded:  “There seems to be a lot of activity bubbling under, but the challenge is to find the mainstream applications, if they're out there.”  Notary image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/02/26/coinspark-20-taps-blockchain-tech-for-notarized-messaging-service,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/60683e136a4769cef37064ddf48b8718f2ff836e-2560x1709.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42378034,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LuwV,1424966090,Bitstamp to Introduce New Fee Structure,"Bitstamp is to simplify its fee schedule next month, a move that will reduce costs for the ""vast majority"" of clients, according to the company.  The Slovenia-based bitcoin exchange said that the revised charges will go live on 2nd March.  The new fee system, which groups market participants according to the amount of dollars traded over a 30-day period, has significantly lowered the transaction fees charged by the exchange.  The current fee structure states that a buyer or seller trading less than $500 would be subject to a 0.50% fee. However, the revised proposal will mean that traders spending less than $20,000 will incur a 0.25% charge.

42378043,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Lv5J,1424962838,Bitcoin Voucher Scheme Bitupcard Expands to 300 Shops in Turkey,"Prepaid bitcoin voucher service Bitupcard is now available at an additional 270 retail locations across Turkey.  The announcement, which follows on from the launch of a pilot scheme that saw $25,000-worth of bitcoin sold in 10 weeks, raises the number of retail locations offering over-the-counter bitcoin purchases in the country to 300.  The scheme is run by Amsterdam-based bitcoin seller Bit4coin in conjunction with Berlin-based firm MK Payment.  Dolf Diederichsen, CEO at Bit4coin said:  ""We are excited with the early success we are seeing in the market. The launch has exceeded our expectations, and we are very happy to quickly expand the reach and make Bitupcard even more accessible to more customers.""  Ibrahim Tarlig, CEO of MK Payment, added: ""The market reception has been very positive and many customers told us that they would like to buy Bitupcard e-vouchers, but that the stores were simply too far away from where they lived or worked.""  How it works  The Bitupcard e-voucher, which works similarly to prepaid mobile vouchers, is available in denominations of 50–500 Turkish lira (roughly $20–$200).  After paying for the voucher, customers receive a paper receipt with a voucher code. The buyer then has to enter the unique code, along with their bitcoin address, at bitupcard.com  The customer should subsequently receive the digital currency in their bitcoin wallet in a matter of hours.  Future plans  When asked about future expansion plans, Diederichsen confirmed that the partnership was planning to increase the store network in Turkey even further.  ""We are already in discussions with partners who could get us access to multiple thousand locations. We have also initiated talks in other markets ... as well – both the Middle East and Asia,"" he said.  Diederichsen added that Turkey's bitcoin community was seemingly smaller in comparison to other markets, such as Amsterdam or Berlin, but said that ""it was very devoted and growing"".",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | MARKET,Yessi Bello Perez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/02/26/bitcoin-voucher-scheme-bitupcard-expands-to-300-shops-in-turkey,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8b5e1d15d4341bb651cc30cafd304c45db21bf27-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42378044,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Lv43,1424959301,OKCoin Gives Away $1.6 Million in Bitcoin for Chinese New Year,"UPDATE (27th February 09:17 GMT): Updated with comment from OKCoin regarding the analysis of the campaign.      The company said: ""The campaign lasted for roughly a week, with a consistent engagement from the domestic market. OKCoin’s red envelopes gave away a total of 10 million RMB, making this the largest initiative on Chinese soil.""    The digital-only giveaway, which stems from the Chinese tradition of exchanging red envelopes containing money, was conducted through the WeChat messaging app account of the exchange's OKLink multisig wallet and merchant services platform.      The exchange said: ""Users who followed our OKLink site were able to send and receive red envelopes. The amount in each of the envelopes varied and were sent to those who signed up to follow our OKLink account on We Chat, consequently with the incentive to claim their red envelope by signing in to our OKLink wallets.""      A spokesperson for OKCoin said:      ""The level of engagement was one of the key indicators of this campaign's success. Roughly half a million new users engaged, and within the first four hours of the campaign over 100,000 individuals were already receiving their red envelopes.""              The spokesperson continued: ""Regarding the number of users, we measured that figure in accordance to the number of new accounts that were opened and registered during the promotion. As for the amount of bitcoin invested, that amount derived from our company's budget for domestic martketing.""      OKCoin is planning an English-language version of its red envelope campaign for its international audience and will release a statement soon.      A similar initiative during the Chinese New Year's celebrations was launched by the Melbourne Bitcoin Technology Centre (MBTC) and the Bitcoin Group, which gave away red envelopes containing bitcoin paper wallets in Melbourne's Chinatown precinct.
