42425670,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIeqbh,1399672503,"All Things Alt: Quark's Shaq-cess, Blackcoin's PR Pivot and Dogecoin's Victory Lap","The past week has been big on the altcoin promotional front, as shown by several marquee projects that are moving ahead or just getting off the ground.  Let’s take a look at some of the more noteworthy projects and initiatives happening in the alt world today.  ‘Dogecar’ driver talks community strength  NASCAR driver Josh Wise’s dogecoin-sponsored journey resulted in a 20th place finish at Talladega this past Sunday. The race was a great one for Wise, who edged his way into the top five during the latter half of the race before slipping back in the standings.  The event served as an unorthodox introduction to digital currencies for some spectators, as many at Talledega hadn’t heard of the meme-themed dogecoin. But from Wise’s perspective, it was a one-of-a-kind experience.  He told Fox News:  ""What made it cool was just the support of the community and the excitement around it. That's pretty unique from a sponsor.""  Wise also remarked that he wasn’t sure if the partnership between dogecoin, reddit and his NASCAR team would continue.  He said that the group was always looking for sponsorship but did not rule out further participation by the dogecoin community. The project to sponsor Wise cost $55,000.  Blackcoin community taps tech PR firm  The blackcoin community has hired a public relations firm to help it brand the altcoin and expand its potential market share.  Max Borges Agency, based out of Miami, Florida, will conduct a 90-day multi-platform marketing campaign. The firm specializes in public relations for technology startups and initiatives.  According to a draft marketing plan, the campaign will focus on targeting mainstream media sources, leveraging social media and promoting the coin as an investment opportunity.  The campaign will reportedly cost $32,500, an amount that was fully crowdfunded in both digital and fiat currencies. According to blackcoin community leader Soepkip, the funding was raised over a 72-hour period.  The marketing effort will focus on how blackcoin and other altcoins represent a new era of digital currencies, and make note of its eco-friendly status (owing to its non-mineable proof-of-stake protocol) and potential attraction to stock market participants.  Quark teams up with Shaquille O’Neill  A new video game featuring the likeness of NBA superstar Shaquille O’Neal will include quark as a payment option. Additionally, a special in-game item will be included that can only be obtained by using quark.  Shaq-Fu: A Legend Reborn  , is being developed by Big Deez Productions. It is a reboot of a 1994 game made for the Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo platforms that features a fictional O'Neal battling monsters from another dimension.  The team behind the new Shaq-Fu raised nearly $500,000 on Indiegogo at the end of the fundraising period this week.  The quark community helped raise funds for the project, which included several social media-fueled “thunderclap” campaigns, according to Vic McPherson, chief editor for Quark Press and member of the Quark Foundation.  The partnership between the quark community and Big Deez Productions, along with Shaq, is expected to continue with expanded social media campaigns ahead of the game’s launch.  Strange alt of the week    Conceptually, the project is founded on the idea of an economy restricted by trade barriers. The result is that transaction times and actual coin creation are purposefully slowed down.    For this, embargocoin has earned this week’s Strange Alt of the Week award.  According to the developer, miners must overcome “embargos” in order to process transactions and receive mining awards. This is the premise behind the 20 minute-long block times.  The coin launched on 9th May with purposefully high initial difficulty, and at press time the mining difficulty had exceeded 6,000,000.  Another aspect of the design, which the developer calls “trade sanctions”, restrict early block rewards. After the first 251 blocks, the reward rises from 50 embargocoins until peaking at 500 embargocoins one month after launch.  Have a tip about a notable happening in the altcoin world?

42425658,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIeqFh,1399669243,Chinese Media Ordered Not to Cover Upcoming Bitcoin Conference,"Chinese media outlets have been issued censorship instructions by government authorities, mandating that no coverage be provided for the upcoming Global Bitcoin Summit, a Beijing-based digital currency conference to be held this weekend, 10th-11th May.  The instructions, leaked online by California-based media outlet China Digital Times, provide evidence that the Chinese government is looking to limit information on bitcoin in the media.  Perhaps most notably, however, the released statement suggests new guidelines for domestic reporting on bitcoin in the future have also been issued:  ""All websites are asked not to participate in or report on the summit. Do not hype bitcoins. All reporting on bitcoins must henceforth accord with the specifications of financial regulatory agencies. Please carry out the above immediately.""  China Digital Times says it collects directives from a variety of sources and checks the results against media reports. However, since media outlets often receive the reports orally, it stresses that the exact wording of the published version is not always accurate.  Furthermore, since the date on the publication corresponds to the date the information is released, it is not known when the order was issued by Chinese authorities.  Speaker changes  The announcement is the latest setback for Global Bitcoin Summit, which released its original lineup in March, but has seen key speakers drop out due to government influence.  On 6th May  , the CEOs of five major China-based digital currency exchanges – OKCoin, BTC China, BtcTrade, CHBTC and Huobi – announced they would not attend the conference, and that they would be taking a joint pledge to comply with state policies and regulations.  The move was reportedly made by the businesses due to recent adverse actions from the People's Bank of China, which has moved to more strictly enforce December rulings meant to more firmly separate its traditional financial services sector from the emerging domestic bitcoin economy.  Heightening tensions  The leak comes amid an uncertain time for China's bitcoin ecosystem, which has recently seen a number of major banks distance themselves publicly from the market.  This week  , ICBC, the world's largest bank by total assets and market capitalization, indicated that its accounts could no longer be used in connection with bitcoin or litecoin trading.  The news followed similar statements from CMB (China Merchants Bank), CCB (China Construction Bank), CGB, CEB (China Everbright Bank), Pingan Bank, Huaxia Bank, ABC (Agricultural Bank of China), BOC (Bank of China), SPD Bank and Industrial Bank.

42425654,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIeq9h,1399665778,Saxo CEO: Bitcoin's Liquidity Problems Are Driving Banks Away,"Saxo Bank co-founder and CEO Lars Seier Christensen has said that bitcoin's liquidity problems are keeping banks out of the market for now. However, banks are looking into bitcoin and could become involved in the future, he said.  In an interview with FXWeek, Christensen commented that banks are unwilling to get involved in bitcoin markets because the current digital currency exchange infrastructure lacks the necessary liquidity to make larger-scale purchases practical:    ""I'm not really sure that an exchange is, at this point, the most efficient way to get a market in here. The key question is the liquidity aspect – who is buying and selling these currencies.      The exchange initiatives are very thin in liquidity.”    Barriers to bitcoin growth  As a result of bitcoin's liquidity problems, it is difficult for large financial institutions like banks buy large quantities on an exchange, Christensen reasoned. Were a bank to try to invest in the bitcoin market, it would likely run into issues actually finding enough BTC to buy on a given day.  Additionally, this makes it harder for large transactions to be orchestrated, which may pose as much a problem of institutional investors as it does for banks. According to Christensen:  ""You almost have to do it bilaterally and find a big seller or big buyer outside of an exchange, unless you have a really market-moving event, which obviously is not going to be very attractive if you are trying get meaningful volume done.""  Christensen also suggested that bitcoin's inability to conduct more complex financial transactions is a problem for banks. He hinted at projects like Ethereum, saying that he has ""seen several attempts to come up with solutions, some of them potentially viable"".  Future bank involvement possible  Christensen didn’t say whether Saxo Bank would get involved in the bitcoin market. However, he is personally invested in the digital currency, and is scheduled to speak at this months’s Bitcoin 2014 conference in Amsterdam.  Currently, Saxo Bank is ""investigating"" bitcoin and determining whether the market is a right fit for the bank. Christensited said that, like most other banks, it remains a wait-and-see situation.  However, he remarked that Saxo Bank is considering a formal investment, saying, “We are not about to launch anything in that space, but we are looking at it and are interested in how it is developing.”  He added that he believes there’s a greater risk in not becoming involved with bitcoin:  “I feel over time it is likely that you will have to engage or you will lose out.”  For more on Christensen's views on the bitcoin market and his own experiences with the digital currency, read his most recent interview with CoinDesk.

42425655,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIeqBh,1399662122,"HashFast Cuts 50% of Staff, Denies Bankruptcy Rumors","San Francisco-based bitcoin mining startup HashFast Technologies has announced that it laid off 50% of its staff due to problems with its evolving business model.  The announcement, made via the company's blog, comes amid growing concern regarding the future of the bitcoing mining chip and product manufacturer. HashFast is currently embroiled in two federal fraud lawsuits and five arbitration cases that allege the company is guilty of breach of contract and fraud related to issues stemming from production delays.  HashFast  also announced that it has brought in new management. The company named Monica Hushen, a prior HP and ECS Refining executive, as the team's new CFO. It further confirmed to CoinDesk that 15 employees had been let go as part of the transition.  The company framed the lay-offs as a tough but necessary move to help it ""refocus"" its business, stating:    ""In order to improve our cash flow, as well as focus on ASICs, we made the difficult decision to reduce our workforce by eliminating marketing and customer service roles, as well as some engineering functions.      This was a fiscally responsible way for us to slow our burn rate, get customers hashing, and continue developing amazing technology.""    The pivot, however, may do little to assuage the company's disappointed customers, some of whom have started a website to detail setbacks in production at the California company.  The announcement notably follows the decision by a Texas court to freeze bitcoin wallets associated with the business this March. HashFash responded at the time by saying that the plaintiff behind the lawsuit had never purchased products from the company.  Growing concern  The staff cuts follow recent notable assertions made by San Rafael-based attorney Ray Gallo, who is representing clients in three of the arbitration cases, to ArsTechnica.  In an interview, Gallo suggested that the company may be facing financial troubles.  He said:  ""My concern is that HashFast is or shortly will be insolvent.""  ArsTechnica visited the company's headquarters as part of the report, though it was not able to talk to any company representatives in an official capacity, it noted that operations appeared to functioning normally.  HashFast has since stated that it has contacted ArsTechnica and that it is working to clarify its concerns for a follow-up report.  New transparency  Speaking to CoinDesk, representative Joe Russell indicated that as part of the changes, HashFast is also looking to become more effective at communicating to the public and its customer base.  Russell framed the company's outreach to ArsTechnica and other media outlets as part of its renewed commitment to transparency, stating:  ""Our intention is to give insight into us as an organization, what we're looking at as far as the future of HashFast and the challenges we've went through.""  Russell also spoke about the business shift, and further commented on suggestions that the company may be preparing a bankruptcy filing, adding:  ""A lot of those accusations are either goal-fueled or competitor-fueled.""  The company did not comment further on the status of any of its ongoing legal cases.  Shipments forthcoming  The company also suggested that product shipments are on the way.  HashFast noted that it has been converting its existing system and board orders to ASICs orders, even for those who are currently seeking legal action.  Wrote the company:  ""We have a large chip inventory that is immediately available for shipping.""  HashFast said that the conversion of its products will result in customers receiving ""significantly more hashing power than ordered"".  Legal disputes continue  Launched in the summer of 2013, HashFast reached the final production stages of its 28nm mining ASIC in September, though skepticism about the company's announcements was already prevalent in the community at the time.  The root of the current legal issues stems from a company announcement in which it resolved to ship its first batch of Baby Jet mining rigs in October, and guaranteed that the units would be delivered by 31st December or customers would receive a full refund.  One key issue in the lawsuit is that HashFast promised reimbursement in BTC, though questions have been raised about whether the company would violate any laws by not returning customer money in bitcoins.

42425665,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIeqRh,1399653182,Trezor and Hardbit Hardware Bitcoin Wallets Will Launch Within Days,"Hardware bitcoin wallets are like buses, it seems. You wait ages for one to come along and then two arrive at once.  Firstly, in aluminium and plastic flavours comes the Trezor from SatoshiLabs. Secondly, is Harbit's plastic-only offering, albeit a rather rugged looking one. Both devices will be on the market shortly, offering bitcoiners a more secure way to store their coins.  While most bitcoin wallets are software-based and exist either online or on a computer or mobile device, hardware wallets (as the name implies) are dedicated devices aimed to more securely store a user's bitcoins.  The advantage of these wallets stems from the fact that, since they don't connect to the Internet, they offer greatly reduced exposure to potential hackers or malware.  Trezor hardware wallet  SatoshiLabs started accepting pre-orders of its hardware wallet last summer, with the devices originally scheduled to ship in October. However, that date was pushed back to January and then had to be further extended.  Now the company says the aluminium-bodied versions will start shipping next week, although bitcoiners desiring the 'classic' plastic model will have to wait a couple more months.  New partnership  In its latest blog post, SatoshiLabs apologized for the delays, which were the result of a disagreement with the original hardware vendor, it said.  The team then decided to take up an offer from an outside investor and find a new hardware supplier to manufacture the plastic model, they said, adding:  “Our new partner is a well known automotive and lightning industry supplier with an annual revenue of $100 million. Thanks to their expertise in small electronics, we were able to improve several technical parameters of our device. The less good news is we will yet have to wait 9 weeks for the first prototypes and another 2-4 weeks for the final products.”  Effectively, the first plastic wallets should ship two to three months from now, more than a year after the campaign was launched and more than six months after the original shipping date came and went.  Crowdfunded development  The Trezor hardware wallet is the result of a crowdfunded campaign launched on Kickstarter last June.  The campaign got a lot of traction and the team behind Trezor – Pavol Rusnak and Marek Palatinus – managed to raise enough money to cover most of the initial cost of developing the wallet.  The only problem was the pricing of pledges. A plastic wallet was priced at 1 BTC, while the aluminium version was 3 BTC.  At the time, bitcoin was hovering around the $100 mark, but a few months later it peaked and reached the $1,000-plus territory. The huge gains that resulted prompted some early adopters to complain about the pricing and ask for their bitcoin back. The team eventually decided to end the crowdfunding campaign.  Hardbit hardware wallet  Trezor is not alone in taking a hardware wallet onto the market – an alternative device called the Hardbit should be on sale within a day or two.  The Hardbit wallethttp://www.bit-sky.com/index.php/hardwarewallet features two-way authentication, a ruggedized plastic case reminiscent of Caterpillar smartphones and measures 48 x 88 x 12.8mm.  The Hardbit device is already launched in China and is planned to be on sale internationally on 10th May. Hardbit says it will only sell in-stock units, with no pre-orders.  The company has not revealed the price or the full spec of the unit, but says it plans to do so shortly.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/05/09/trezor-and-hardbit-hardware-bitcoin-wallets-will-launch-within-days,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8f1095c7d9431c52c0095c8167f8950dcaae1dd0-955x619.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The run-off election featured three candidates, including BTC China CEO Bobby Lee, venture capitalist Brock Pierce and CEO of mobile gift card provider Gyft, Vinny Lingham. The results were particularly close, with Lee receiving 79% approval and Pierce scoring 65% – just 2% above Lingham, who received 63%.  With the announcement, Lee and Pierce join a board that includes executive director Jon Matonis, bitcoin chief scientist Gavin Andresen, Bitcoin Magazine's Elizabeth Ploshay and Ribbit Capital's Micky Malka, alongside founder and chairman Peter Vessenes.  This news follows the 1st May results of an initial round of voting, which ended with none of the original 15 candidates reaching the necessary vote threshold to win a seat.  These industry seats have been vacant since the resignation of two founding members – former BitInstant CEO Charlie Shrem and Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles – earlier this year.  China's outspoken CEO  Lee has been one of the more outspoken voices from China's bitcoin community internationally, appearing in notable Western media outlets including Businessweek and Wired.  His company is one of the oldest Chinese bitcoin exchanges and the former market leader, though it has seen increased competition from Huobi and OKCoin, the latter of which is now the country's largest digital currency exchange.  The CEO's appointment comes at a time when the Bitcoin Foundation is putting an emphasis on bolstering perception of bitcoin internationally, most recently anointing Mexico's Fundación Satoshi Nakamoto as its third official affiliate chapter.  Serial entrepreneur  A former child star who appeared in the classic US film 'The Mighty Ducks', Pierce has more recently gained credibility in the investment world, where he leads a successful bitcoin-focused AngelList syndicate.  Pierce has helped found GoCoin, ExpressCoin, KnCMiner and Robocoin Asia, and recently launched a plan to save the now-bankrupt bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox.  That plan passed a key hurdle yesterday when it was approved by a US court.  Under the proposal, former users of the exchange would receive equity in a new Mt. Gox that would provide restitution for funds lost in the original exchange's insolvency.

According to Channel News Asia, the case is the first of its kind in the country – an arrest for a crime involving both drugs and digital currency.  The suspect has been named as 38-year-old Ayumu Teramoto and his arrest was carried out by police forces in Tokyo and Fukuoka.  Teramoto is suspected of buying and importing illegal stimulants – terms usually used in the Japanese media to describe cocaine and methamphetamines.  Bitcoin payment  The suspect allegedly used ¥3.5m ($34,500) worth of bitcoin to pay for a drug deal involving 50g of the unnamed drug, according to CNA.  The drugs were then shipped to an airport near Tokyo, reportedly concealed inside a tablet computer. It is unclear what raised suspicions, but it is clear that police managed to identify and successfully intercept the shipment.  Police claim Teramoto used an online service to procure the drugs, but they did not reveal any details, other than the fact that the transaction was carried out in bitcoin.  Echoes of Silk Road  Silk Road  was the anonymous online marketplace that became infamous for its drug dealing activities and reliance on cryptocurrency for payments. More than 30,000 bitcoins were seized following the site's closure and the arrest of its alleged ringleader Ross Ulbricht.  However, since the Silk Road's demise new anonymous marketplaces have sprung up to take its place, namely Silk Road 2.0, with varying levels of success. However, according to a recent report published by the Digital Citizens Alliance, the online trade in illicit drugs is bigger than ever.

42374521,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvlCiv,1399640088,Congressman Jared Polis Accepting Bitcoin Donations Following FEC Ruling,"Following the unanimous decision yesterday by the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to approve the acceptance of bitcoin donations for political campaigns, Democrat Jared Polis has already started accepting bitcoin for his re-election campaign.  The campaign committee, Jared Polis for Congress, announced yesterday that the Colorado Representative was one of the first politicians to accept digital currencies.  Donations can be made on Polis' website, which was launched shortly after the FEC vote yesterday.  In a written statement, Polis said:  “I am thrilled that the FEC has chosen to take a forward-looking stance on digital currencies, recognizing the rights of individuals seeking alternatives to government backed currencies to participate in our democratic political process.""  The FEC ruling in question came after months of debating. There are still many restrictions on bitcoin donations in political campaigns, such as no anonymous contributions, and donations must be scrutinized for 'evidence of legality'.  Bitcoin believer  Polis has been one of the more vocal advocates of digital currencies in the US Congress.  In February, Senator Joe Manchin wrote an open letter to the regulatory agency arguing that bitcoin is “disruptive to our economy"" and should be banned.  In response to Senator Manchin's plea, Polis wrote satirical letter to the US Treasury requesting a ban on physical dollars, saying:  “The exchange of dollar bills, including high denomination bills, is currently unregulated and has allowed users to participate in illicit activity, while also being highly subject to forgery, theft, and loss.”  Polis' spokesperson Scott Overland clarified for those who didn’t pick up the irony in Polis’ letter that the Congressman was simply joking.  “This is just a satirical version of Senator Manchin’s letter, meant to draw attention to the fact that BitCoins are not any more susceptible to the problems that the Senator points out than dollars,” said Overland.  Polis was also the first congressman to publicly buy bitcoin, after inviting ATM maker Robocoin to give a presentation at Capitol Hill on 8th April. He said that he planned to buy a new pair of socks with the bitcoin he purchased on the day.  Polis also added in his statement from yesterday:  “Bitcoin, and other digital currencies, are just beginning to show the world what a tremendous tool they can be; whether it is reducing transaction costs in developing nations, giving people more options for engaging in commerce, or sending Representatives dedicated to advancing personal freedom to Congress.”  More key players  Polis may be leading the pack, but other US politicians are starting to get behind bitcoin.  Entrepreneur Paul Dietzel (Republican) has also announced today that he is accepting bitcoin donations for his Congress campaign on his Twitter feed. If elected he would become the the youngest Congressman in the country.  Additionally, Steve Stockman of Texas has been a vocal opponent of the federal policy. At the beginning of the year, Congressman Stockman announced that his campaign was going to start accepting bitcoin donations for his Senate run.  He is also preparing a bill to tax bitcoin as currency instead of property, as currently demanded by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

The latest to make a statement is a significant one – the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) is not just the biggest in China, but the largest bank in the world by total assets and market capitalization.  In a statement, the ICBC said:  ""From this date, any institution or individual must not use accounts set up with our bank for the deposit and withdrawal [...] and transfer of funds for Bitcoin and Litecoin trading,""  Again, news reports gave the reasons for the decision as: ""[to] protect the property rights and interests of the public, prevent money laundering risks, as well as to safeguard the status of the renminbi as the legal currency.""

Those banks are the CMB (China Merchants Bank), CCB (China Construction Bank), BOC (Bank of China), CEB (China Everbright Bank), Pingan Bank, Huaxia Bank, ABC (Agricultural Bank of China), CGB, SPD Bank, and Industrial Bank.  The announcements have come as a shock to no one, given that the 10th May PBOC deadline has been widely publicized.

Bitcoin Summit begins tomorrow  The central bank's deadline was most likely set to coincide with the two-day Global Bitcoin Summit, due to begin tomorrow morning in Beijing.  Although the bitcoin community has kept its head up and is pressing on with the conference, there have been some casualties: the CEOs of five large Chinese exchanges, some of whom were due to speak and whose companies were event sponsors, withdrew from official participation in the event.  In a statement, the CEOs said they had agreed not to participate in public bitcoin events, not engage in excessive speculation, and report all developments to the authorities.  At least one Chinese bitcoin exchange, FXBTC, has closed down as a result of the new regulatory environment.

42425669,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIeqdh,1399630337,What Are Bitcoin Nodes and Why Do We Need Them?,"It's well known that bitcoin is designed as a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) network. However, what's often lost in translation is the sheer amount of machinery that is needed to maintain this global infrastructure.  For example, in order to validate and relay transactions, bitcoin requires more than a network of miners processing transactions, it must broadcast messages across a network using 'nodes'. This is the first step in the transaction process that results in a block confirmation.  To function to its full potential, the bitcoin network must not only provide an avenue for transactions, but also remain secure. By using a number of randomly selected nodes, the network can reduce the problem of double spending – when a user attempts to spend the same digital token twice.  However, bitcoin doesn't just need nodes, it requires lots of fully functioning nodes – nodes that have the bitcoin core client on a machine instance with the complete block chain. The more nodes there are, the more secure the network is.  This is one of the reasons there is a plan to put bitcoin nodes in space, and that the plan has important implications for bitcoin.  The problem is, the number of nodes on the network is dropping, and core developers believe it may continue to do so.  Waning support  Looking at a 60-day chart of bitcoin nodes shows that the number has gone down significantly. It went from 10,000 reachable nodes in early March to below 8,000 at the beginning of May.    What's interesting is that during a recent 24-hour period, the number of reachable nodes went down from 8,200 to 7,600 and back to 8,200 again. This suggests that a portion of users running nodes are turning off their machines at night, meaning that this contingent of nodes are being run on desktops or laptops.    Another issue is the geographic distribution of the nodes. The majority of reachable nodes are located in North America.  In Africa, where bitcoin could perhaps help people lacking access to financial resources more than anywhere else, there is a regional paucity of reachable nodes.  Lack of incentive  Unlike bitcoin mining, where participants are rewarded for confirming transactions, running a bitcoin node does not provide any incentive. The only benefit for someone to run a node is to help protect the network, and based on the Bitnodes data, the number of people interested in supporting the network with a full node is waning.  There could be a number of reasons for that.  For one thing, running a full node utilizes the resources of a machine for basically no monetary return. Plus, the collapse of Mt. Gox has likely left many people with less desire to support the digital currency.  Furthermore, the popularity of the bitcoin core client in China, where it was for a time immensely popular, has tapered off given the contentious regulatory environment there.  Centralization of mining  In terms of supporting the bitcoin network, it used to be a lot easier for the average user to participate. However, the advent of massive ASIC data centres has weakened the consensual nature of mining, and by extension providing nodes, for many people.  Ross McKelvie, lead engineer at bitcoin incubator Boost VC, believes that it will be larger operators with data centres like KnCMiner that will have to pick up the slack in the number of bitcoin nodes, reasoning:  ""As bitcoin grows, so does the network and the computing power behind the scenes required to run it. The majority of bitcoiners won't be able to support their own nodes and will be taken over by companies like KnC.""  KnCMiner is just an example of economics and logistics in the mining industry pushing bitcoin towards a more centralized future. McKelvie also believes that major technology companies that take interest in bitcoin will have to put their computing resources behind the digital currency:  ""I wouldn't be surprised if we see large tech companies like Google and Amazon throwing resources at bitcoin as they adopt the currency.""  Feedback from nodes  As part of the bitcoin core developer team, Mike Hearn sees the issue of nodes dropping from 10,000 down to under 7,000 as a significant problem. To Hearn, the core of the issue is disinterest in both expending computing resources and electricity toward something that may have diminishing value.  On the bitcoin developer mailing list, Hearn has proposed added functionality that would allow communications between nodes and the developers to better understand why so many are dropping out.  Hearn also wants to exclude consumer wallets installed on laptops and desktops from the network as well.  This is because their number will continue to decline no matter what – and they appear to only be working when users are awake during the day.  One of the reasons why lots of nodes are important is redundancy, according to Hearn:  ""It makes [the bitcoin network] 'seem' bigger, more robust and more decentralised, because there are more people uniting to run it. So there's a psychological benefit.""  Moving forward  Bitcoin core developer Jeff Garzik believes that community attention to the lack of nodes supporting the network is what the industry needs in order to boost numbers:  ""I agree we need more full nodes. I've long been a proponent of such calls for more nodes.""  However, such calls for voluntary support might not be enough motivation for people to do so, though, so, one logical idea that has been floated is to give nodes some sort of incentive.  However, that's probably not feasible right now: over the past six months, miners have been averaging a daily reward of 15.98 BTC per day, according to Blockchain.  Recent bitcoin prices would peg that value at around $7,040 per day for the entire network – and the growth in transaction fees has been incredibly flat over the past six months. As a result, miners would likely be reluctant to concede any revenue to bitcoin nodes, which don't require pricey ASIC hardware to run.  Members of the bitcoin community seem to be losing interest in hosting full nodes. And it's something to pay attention to, because over time it might mean that the major companies in the industry may have to pick up the slack.  If larger players are taking up the role of supporting the network as full nodes, though, it continues to lessen the amount of decentralization the network has at an infrastructure level.  This is all down to circumstances surrounding bitcoin sentiment – the rise of ASICs, the selloffs in China and complete collapse of Mt. Gox – plus little in the way of incentives for someone to run a node.
