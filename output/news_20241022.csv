The price has recently encountered resistance at the crucial $69,000 level, which is expected to take time and significant liquidity to overcome. Key data from Binance reveals that more than half of futures traders have shorted BTC in the past few hours, creating a divisive environment for price action. Related Reading: Ethereum Upside Target Around $2,800 As Price Tests Key Resistance The futures market often serves as a barometer for momentum and liquidity, signaling potential shifts in Bitcoin‚Äôs price movement. As BTC consolidates just below the $69,000 resistance, maintaining support above $66,000, the coming days will be pivotal. Investors and analysts are closely watching to determine whether Bitcoin will break through to new all-time highs or if the accumulation period will continue. The outcome could set the tone for the next phase of the market. Bitcoin Future Traders Remain Bearish (For Now) Bitcoin is currently in a consolidation phase after weeks of impressive price appreciation. Despite this pause, analysts and investors remain optimistic about Bitcoin‚Äôs price trajectory in the coming weeks, with many believing that BTC will begin a massive rally once it breaks its all-time highs. However, this breakout may take some time, as key data from Binance indicates bearish sentiment among futures traders. Top analyst and investor Ali Martinez shared the 4-hour long-short ratio on Binance, revealing that 53.71% of futures traders are shorting BTC. This bearish positioning suggests indecision in the market, as traders remain uncertain when Bitcoin will surpass the critical $69,000 level. The ongoing shorting trend could be a temporary barrier to Bitcoin‚Äôs momentum. However, the outlook could shift quickly, as spot investors might take advantage of the current dip and start buying Bitcoin. Increased spot buying could provide the liquidity needed to push BTC higher, reversing the bearish sentiment in the futures market. Related Reading: Solana Could ‚ÄòGo Parabolic‚Äô Starting Today ‚Äì Analyst Sets $370 Target If buying pressure intensifies, Bitcoin could soon challenge and break through the $69,000 resistance, potentially paving the way for a new all-time high. In the short term, investors are closely watching to see whether Bitcoin will consolidate further or gain enough momentum to continue its upward trend. BTC Testing Key Liquidity Levels Bitcoin is trading at $66,800 after facing a rejection from the $69,000 supply level. Despite the pullback, BTC remains strong, holding above the $66,000 mark. This price level is critical, as it will likely determine Bitcoin‚Äôs direction in the coming days. Should BTC fail to hold above $66,000, the price could seek liquidity at lower levels, with $64,000 as the next target. This level coincides with the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA) and exponential moving average (EMA), making it a key interest for buyers and sellers. On the other hand, if Bitcoin maintains its position above $66,000, the next likely move will be a renewed challenge of the $69,000 resistance or potentially a push toward $70,000. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Above $0.12 Level ‚Äì Time For DOGE To Catch Up? The coming days will be crucial in deciding whether BTC will resume its upward momentum or face further consolidation around these key levels.

Some market analysts believe it does, seeing that the crypto is moving in a favorable pattern. Investors and traders are now paying attention to Solana after an impressive comeback, allowing the digital currency to once again hit a two-month high. Related Reading: ApeCoin Climbs Over 100% On Major Tech Advancements ‚Äì Details Solana Set For A Historic Price Rally Several analysts predicted that Solana could gear up for an exponential price rally after the crypto successfully rebounded from a slump in August. According to their computation, the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price could skyrocket by over 2,500%, saying that from its current price of slightly over $170, Solana is on track to reach the $4,500 level. It is a huge growth that excites crypto traders and enthusiasts alike. The forecast was made after Solana clawed its way back to the $171 mark in the last 11 weeks, the highest it has attained since August 1. Traders argued that the digital currency‚Äôs impressive recovery indicated that its price could go up further, saying that it is gaining momentum, and a 25-fold price hike is possible. Although some market observers agree that Solona‚Äôs price is moving on an upward trajectory, they are a bit pessimistic about the 2,500% surge, offering a much more conservative estimate for the hike. According to CoinGecko, a price increase of $450 from the current $171 is more reasonable than massive growth being floated by other analysts.

35020609,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649214,1729625425,"Bitcoin Cup And Handle Cascade: Analyst Says BTC Price Could Reach $230,000 If It Follows This Structural Path","A crypto analyst has projected a significant break to the upside for Bitcoin, drawing parallels to similar breakouts in traditional assets in the tune of the Gold and the S&P500. According to a technical analysis of the current price action, Bitcoin is playing out a cup and handle pattern, which could send it surging to bullish price targets above $230,000. Bitcoin Cup And Handle Cascade According to a technical analysis, Bitcoin appears to be forming a textbook cup and handle pattern on the largest timeframe, which is a bullish continuation pattern that often leads to a major price rally. This formation typically indicates a period of consolidation followed by a breakout to the upside, and if the pattern fully plays out, Bitcoin could surge to new heights. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Prediction: Crypto Analyst Says Things Are ‚ÄòAbout To Get Interesting‚Äô In a recent analysis shared on the social media platform X, technical analyst Gert van Lagen compared Bitcoin‚Äôs ongoing cup and handle formation to similar patterns observed in Gold and the S&P 500. Van Lagen pointed out that Gold experienced a comparable setup of the formation of the cup and handle, which ultimately led to a full-scale bull rally in 2023. This breakout pushed Gold to new highs which has continued up until the time of writing, with Gold now trading above $2,730 in its history. Similarly, the analyst highlighted a similar cup and handle pattern in the SP500, which eventually led to a rally that kickstarted in late 2023 and culminated in new peaks for the index. Van Lagen emphasized that Bitcoin has been tracing out a similar pattern since the 2022 bear market. The ‚Äúcup‚Äù portion of the formation was completed when Bitcoin reached its all-time high back in March. Now, Bitcoin is in the process of forming the ‚Äúhandle‚Äù part of the pattern, as the cryptocurrency has yet to revisit its all-time high over the past seven months. Should the handle formation conclude and a breakout occur, Bitcoin could be on the verge of a strong rally, much like Gold and the S&P 500 experienced during their respective runs. BTC To $230,000 According to van Lagen, Bitcoin is ‚Äúpoised to follow the structural path of SP500 & Gold.‚Äù In terms of a price target, he predicted a target of $230,000 for Bitcoin. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $67,350. Reaching the $230,000 price level would necessitate a 197% price increase from the current price. Related Reading: Machine Learning Algorithm Predicts XRP Price Direction For This Week, What To Expect Interestingly, van Lagen‚Äôs forecast is just one of several bullish outlooks resurfacing as Bitcoin‚Äôs price has shown positive momentum since the second week of October. Bitcoin is up by about 13.5% from $59,500 on October 10, which has prompted a return of bullish sentiment. According to a report, this has caused a rise in Bitcoin accumulation by long-term holders, who now hold about 2.9 million BTC.

42415726,WEE6jQWt4rgJorpzkomdVq,1729625400,Andy Barr's 'Vision' for House Financial Services,"Congressman Andy Barr (R-Ky.) is one of the lawmakers running to succeed U.S. House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) as the head of the Republican wing of the committee, which oversees regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission and is responsible for shepherding legislation that might affect the U.S. capital markets and banking sectors, among others. He shared some of his thoughts on what his crypto priorities might be during an aside at the Flyover Fintech conference on Monday.  PS: I'll be in Washington, D.C., this week for part of Wednesday, all day Thursday (at the DC Privacy Summit) and some of Friday. Let's catch up if you're around.  You‚Äôre reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  'Cast a vision'  The narrative  Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) is retiring at the end of this congressional term. A number of lawmakers are vying to take up his role as the leader of the U.S. House Financial Services Committee, including Rep. Andy Barr (R-N.C.), who spoke briefly at the Flyover Fintech conference hosted by Rep. Mike Flood (R-Neb.) in Lincoln, Nebraska, on Monday.  Why it matters  A number of crypto priorities depend on the Financial Services Committee. Stablecoin legislation, market structure bills, even an industry-sought overturning of Securities and Exchange Commission guidance needs to work through the committee. The Republican leader of the committee may also need to work with Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), the head of the Democrats on the committee, in the event her party takes control of the House or for any other reason requiring bipartisan support. Barr laid out some of his views during a lunchtime speech and brief Q&A, but shared more of his crypto-specific views afterward.  Breaking it down  Rep. Barr spoke to roughly 300 audience members during the lunch break at Flyover Fintech, laying out his view for restoring the American Dream. Barr is one of several Republican lawmakers hoping to secure leadership of his party's wing in the Financial Services Committee next year after current Chair McHenry retires from Congress.  In an interview with CoinDesk after his public remarks, Barr said he was laying out his positions ahead of next month's leadership elections in the Republican caucus.  ""I'm just doing the best I can to cast a vision, educate my colleagues about what that vision is, but also listen to my colleagues about what they want in leadership in the House Financial Services Committee,"" Barr said.  The House GOP will vote on its leadership shortly after next month's election, including the whip and leader. The lawmakers would then appoint a steering committee, and only after that would committee chairs (or ranking members, if Democrats retake the House) be chosen.  If he is chosen to lead, Barr said the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act would be on his agenda, when asked what crypto-specific initiatives he may focus on.  ""If we are unable to get FIT21 across the finish line through the year-end vehicles, which are the NDAA [National Defense Authorization Act] and the omnibus [spending bill], then we need to be persistent and we need to redouble our efforts and reintroduce in the next Congress,"" he said.  In the event the bill does fall to the next Congress, Barr said it would be an opportunity to revise it, though he said he didn't ""have many suggested changes.""  ""I think they've done a marvelous job,"" he said, referring to Reps. McHenry, French Hill (R-Ark.) and Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.).  ""And if the reason why it fails in the lame duck is that we didn't do a good enough job getting enough Democrats on board, then it gives us an opportunity to maybe see what we can do to get the job done,"" he said. ""We shouldn't let the perfect be the enemy of the good, right?""  Barr also said it was ""disappointing"" that Congress wasn't able to override President Joe Biden's veto of an effort to overturn Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, a controversial custody rule that crypto advocates argue blocks most financial institutions from providing custody services to the sector.  ""We need to create a pathway for regulated financial institutions, banks [and] non-banks, to safely custody digital assets,"" he said.  I also spoke with Rep. Flood after the day's events wrapped, more specifically about legislation. The lawmaker noted that Rep. McHenry ""is well-regarded,"" and people were still working to find a way and have FIT21 passed into law during the forthcoming lame duck session (the time between Election Day in two weeks and when new members of Congress take their seat in January.)  ""I still remain hopeful we can at least get FIT done,"" he said. Stablecoin legislation will wait until next year, and if FIT21 doesn't pass in 2024, it will also pass in 2025, Flood emphasized.  ""We have serious people working in financial innovation that can create a lot of jobs, generate wealth, cement America even more as the world's financial juggernaut,"" he said. ""But there are pitfalls, and there are things to watch out for, and regulators and lawmakers need to make sure we're building a foundation, but not an overly prescriptive set of rules. So I think it's hard to sit here and not get excited about some of the innovation that's happening, but at the same time, how are we going to regulate it? How are we going to ensure that the innovation survives our regulations?""

Tangible's CEO, Jagpal Singh, is the brother of Joshvun Singh, who ran a company called BMS Luna Stacks. CoinDesk's Danny Nelson dug into the companies, finding an ""undisclosed business relationship"" wherein Joshvun Singh's company would apparently buy properties and immediately flip them to Jagpal Singh's Tangible at a markup sometimes exceeding 20%.

His attorneys say he should be spared prison. His attorneys did not mention what the presentence investigation report's recommendation was.  This week  This week  In the U.S., Congress is out of session and we're just two weeks away from Election Day.  Elsewhere:  (U.S. SEC) The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission published its annual list of examination priorities on Monday. While much of its crypto detail resembles previous years' lists, the 2025 file did not include a line about the Division of Examinations considering ""whether advisers are complying with the custody requirements under the Advisers Act."" The SEC previously proposed a custody rule but it's reviewing that proposal. Adding to the uncertainty is the fact we're a few weeks out from an election which may shake up the regulator. (H/t Jesse Hamilton)  (U.S. SEC) The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission shared a bit more detail about its forthcoming appeal in its case against Ripple. An addendum to its Form C filing said it was appealing, ""Whether the district court erroneously granted partial summary judgment in favor of defendants with respect to Ripple‚Äôs offers and sales of XRP on digital asset trading platforms (and Garlinghouse‚Äôs and Larsen‚Äôs aiding and abetting of those offers and sales), Garlinghouse‚Äôs and Larsen‚Äôs personal offers and sales of XRP, and Ripple‚Äôs distributions of XRP in exchange for consideration other than cash. These issues are to be reviewed de novo."" I also just wanted to note that, despite a lot of X (formerly Twitter) chatter about the SEC missing its two-week deadline to file on Oct. 16, the appeals court docket opened on Oct. 3, 2024, on PACER, a day after the regulator alerted the district court it was filing a notice of appeal.  (The Atlantic) Speaking of online misinformation, this Atlantic piece by Charlie Warzel is interesting, but was wildly misconstrued on social media platforms like the former bird site ‚Äì ironically highlighting the point of this article (which, to be clear, does not call for government entities to regulate online speech).  (Open Secrets) Elon Musk, who's endorsed Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, helped fund a group that in turn created a fake website and initiative purporting to support Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. That entity, called Progress 2028, is sending around text messages and flyers claiming to outline Harris' policies ‚Äì but, per Open Secrets, these ""highlight disproven and misleading claims."" Anecdotally, I know someone who reacted to one such scheme exactly the way this campaign appears to hope for.  (The Wall Street Journal) Four accounts on Polymarket dramatically shifted Donald Trump's odds of victory on the prediction market site with $30 million.  (The Verge) The U.S. Federal Trade Commission adopted a final rule ""requiring businesses to make canceling a subscription as easy as signing up.""

42422046,lZj3zXFJWcbTdP3qeivrX7,1729621421,Tether CEO Ardoino Says He Expects U.S. Will Catch Up in Crypto Regulation,"Stablecoin issuer Tether's CEO made a U.S. appearance to explain how helpful his company is being with law enforcement agencies and how he'll embrace government oversight.  The appearance at DC Fintech Week was remote, with Paolo Ardoino making his case from a video screen.  Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino told a U.S. crowd on Tuesday that he's counting on sensible crypto regulations coming soon from the U.S.  ""There is no place like the U.S.,"" he said via video link at DC Fintech Week in Washington. ""I think it's very, very important that sensible crypto regulations and stablecoin regulations will come to fruition in a way that will protect the end users,"" he said, predicting that would happen in the U.S.  When the U.S. arrives at rules, it will allow stablecoin innovations to continue to offer a ""lifeline"" to people in other parts of the world who ""don't have the same opportunities as people in the U.S. and Europe.""  Tether is the top global issuer of stablecoins ‚Äì namely {{USDT}}. Stablecoins are a subset of the cryptocurrency sector that are generally pegged to the dollar or other non-volatile assets, and they're meant to be the more steady side of transactions into otherwise volatile crypto.  Tether and its CEO have been making a recent case that the decade-old company is cooperating with governments after a history in which it was known more for defiance of such relationships. Ardoino, tuning into the event on his 40th birthday, argued that it would be difficult to find another financial firm that matches the level of law-enforcement cooperation and number of agency relationships that Tether has in 45 countries, including with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Secret Service.  Making the case for stablecoins and Tether, which now boasts more than 330 million users, he said his company survived billions in sudden redemptions in 2022 ‚Äì more than 10% of its reserves ‚Äì that was ""a type of pressure that almost no bank was able to survive."" He argued that Tether's 104% over-collateralized reserve, based mostly (84%) in U.S. Treasuries, is the best quality backing the company could set up, though the company has long taken criticism for a lack of transparency into its holdings.  ""We are purchasing immense quantities of U.S. debt,"" Ardoino said. ""The most important job of a stablecoin issuer is being able to liquidate the reserves and pay back everyone"" in a time of redemptions, he said.  He contended that the company's holdings would rival a mid-range country in its Treasuries portfolio, but it carries less risk to the U.S. because it doesn't represent a single entity that can buy or dump huge swaths of the market in one action.  Read More: Stablecoin Regulations Could Pose Problems for Tether, JPMorgan Says; USDT Issuer Claims Sour Grapes  Ardoino said that Tether's non-U.S. focus makes sense, because people in the U.S. already have easy access to dollar-based assets, while such assets are urgently needed in other countries ‚Äì especially those with massive inflation.  ""I am very in favor ‚Äì and we as a company are very in favor ‚Äì of regulations, but regulation should help defend the customer,"" Ardoino said, arguing that European standards for stablecoins are problematic, in part, because of that region's particular approach to cash reserves.  Read More: Tether's USDT Has Uses Beyond Crypto Markets, Trading: CEO Paolo Ardoino  The company has also been subjected to law-enforcement scrutiny itself, though that hasn't developed yet into a major criminal case in the U.S.  Also at the conference, Rep. French Hill (R-Ark.), who leads the crypto panel within the House Financial Services Committee, said that crypto and stablecoin legislation have a chance to catch traction in the final weeks of the congressional session known as the ""lame duck"" period. He said the Senate has left a gap in a defense spending package for potential financial-services additions, though Hill added that the legislative strategy may depend on who wins the presidential election.  If it doesn't happen this year, Hill ‚Äì who may be a contender to run the wider committee next year as its chairman, Rep.

The fund focuses on investments in data centers across the U.S, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, India, and Europe, and it is claimed to be the ""world‚Äôs first combined equity and debt tokenized fund,"" according to the press release.  The fund leverages tech by San Francisco-based tokenization service provider Zoniqx to create security tokens of the underlying financial instruments.  The issuance marks a milestone for XRP Ledger and development firm Ripple Labs' newfound ambition to claim a share of the booming real-world asset (RWA) tokenization space. Institutional investors are increasingly placing traditional financial products like bonds, credit and equity on blockchain rails in pursuit of operational efficiency gains and speedier around-the-clock settlements. The RWA market could grow to trillions of dollars over the next years, various reports from McKinsey, BCG, 21Shares and Bernstein estimated.  Ripple is also awaiting approval from New York state regulators to launch its U.S. dollar stablecoin, which would play a key role to improve liquidity and support institutions to tokenize and settle financial assets on the XRPL network, Ripple Labs President Monica Long said last week at the company's annual Swell conference.

35017837,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649225,1729620003,"Expert Sets $285,000 Bitcoin Price Target Based On Quantile Model","Sina‚Äîa professor, consultant, and co-founder & COO of 21stCapital.com‚Äîis projecting that the Bitcoin price could rise as high as $285,000 by the end of 2025 in a new analysis shared on X. Utilizing a quantile regression model, Sina identifies distinct phases in Bitcoin‚Äôs market cycle. Can Bitcoin Price Skyrocket Above $200,000? The model identifies the Cold Zone ( 66%), ranges from $136,000 to $285,000. This zone is characterized by heightened volatility and significant price swings as mass adoption peaks and leveraged positions become prevalent. While there is substantial room for upside, the risk of reversals escalates rapidly. Sina advises investors to either hold and enjoy potential gains or consider gradually exiting positions based on risk assessments, particularly since historical tops occur in the 90th to 99th quantile range. Notably, the 90th quantile starts at $211,000. What astonishes Sina is how these 33% quantile ranges align seamlessly with Bitcoin‚Äôs historical phase transitions. He notes that Bitcoin tends to spend exactly one-third of its time in each zone before transitioning to the next, almost like clockwork. This pattern means that most of the bear market occurs below the 33% quantile, while bull market euphoria begins above the 66% quantile. Renowned crypto analyst PlanC (@TheRealPlanC) acknowledged Sina‚Äôs model, commenting that it is a ‚Äúperfect explanation‚Äîsuper clear.‚Äù Sina, in turn, credited PlanC for the foundational work that influenced his own model. Related Reading: 7 Reasons To Be Bullish On Bitcoin This Week PlanC has also recently updated his ‚ÄúPower Law Probability Model,‚Äù which forecasts Bitcoin prices ranging from $189,733 to $245,264 for the 97% to 99.9% quantile and $145,182 to $189,733 for the 90% to 97% quantile. He emphasizes that despite appearances, the underlying data follows a power-law relationship, independent of how it‚Äôs plotted‚Äîbe it linear, log-linear, or log-log scales. ‚ÄúThe data follows a log-log relationship with quantile regressions, whereas the rainbow chart uses logarithmic regression with a log-linear relationship. I am not ‚Äòdrawing‚Äô these lines. These are quantile regressions of the log of price vs. time, based on all the data we have to date,‚Äù he explains. To contextualize the model‚Äôs predictive capabilities, PlanC elaborates on the significance of various quantiles. The 99.9% quantile means the price has been above this line only 0.1% of the time, equating to just one day out of every 1,000 days‚Äîa very rare event. The 99% quantile indicates the price has exceeded this line 1% of the time, or one day out of every 100 days, also considered rare. Conversely, the 0.1% quantile reflects that the price has fallen below this line only 0.1% of the time. At press time, BTC traded at $67,121.

The ""Bitcoin Interest on Cash"" feature pays a variable rate of interest, which currently stands at 3.8% as of Oct. 22.  River's aim is to give bitcoin users the best of both worlds between maintaining a cash buffer of savings to meet expenses as they arise, while also earning BTC.  Bitcoin financial services company River Financial has introduced a new product that provides users with interest on cash deposits, which can be paid in BTC or USD.  The ""Bitcoin Interest on Cash"" feature pays a variable rate of interest, which stands at 3.8% as of Oct. 22, according to an announcement on Tuesday.  Not a bank itself, River has teamed up with Lead Bank, a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), meaning user deposits are protected up to the value of $250,000.  River's aim is to give bitcoin users the best of both worlds between maintaining a cash buffer of savings to meet expenses as they arise, while also earning BTC. This gives customers a reason to keep their cash on River's platform, rather than in a bank.  The company is attempting to differentiate itself from other bitcoin yield-bearing products that have been offered in the past, and which have had a habit of ending in tears. River stipulates that it is offering yield on customer cash, not their bitcoin.

Over the past two weeks, ETH has maintained a bullish trajectory, sparking optimism across the market as investors look for further signs of strength in the price action. Top analyst and investor Carl Runefelt recently shared a technical analysis, highlighting that Ethereum has broken out of a bullish pattern that began forming in early August. According to Runefelt, once ETH confirms solid demand around its current level, it‚Äôs only a matter of days before the next rally kicks off. Related Reading: Solana Could ‚ÄòGo Parabolic‚Äô Starting Today ‚Äì Analyst Sets $370 Target With the broader crypto market gaining momentum, Ethereum is positioned to continue climbing, and investors are closely watching for confirmation of support at this key level. If ETH holds, the next leg up could be targeting higher price zones, adding to the bullish sentiment. The coming days will determine whether Ethereum can resume its upward trend and capitalize on the ongoing market strength. Ethereum Pushing Above $2,600 Ethereum has underperformed compared to Bitcoin this year, leaving many investors concerned as the next bull run approaches. While Bitcoin has surged, Ethereum has struggled to rally with the same strength. This has sparked worry among ETH holders, who expected the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap to lead the charge. Top analyst Carl Runefelt recently shared a compelling analysis on X. The analysis features¬†a price chart that reveals Ethereum breaking out of a symmetrical triangle on the daily timeframe‚Äîa classic bullish pattern. If price action holds, it could send ETH to $3,400, according to Runefelt‚Äôs analysis. This breakout is a key signal for Ethereum, but its sustainability depends on whether the price can successfully retest the upper triangle line, which had previously acted as resistance. Currently, Ethereum is testing support at this critical level, with $2,600 being the line in the sand. A close below $2,600 would invalidate the symmetrical triangle‚Äôs bullish thesis and could lead to further downside, putting a dent in the optimism surrounding ETH‚Äôs future price action. Related Reading: XRP Network Activity Surges As Price Seeks To Break $0.55 Resistance However, if Ethereum holds above this level, it could signify that the breakout is intact, setting the stage for a strong rally as the broader market prepares for a bull run. The next few days will be crucial for ETH‚Äôs trajectory. Price Action: Technical Levels To Watch Ethereum is at $2,620 after failing to reclaim the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $2,795. The price is testing support around the crucial $2,600 level, which will determine the direction of ETH‚Äôs price action in the coming days. If Ethereum holds above this level, the next target would be back above the 1D 200 EMA at $2,800. This is a crucial price zone as it aligns with ETH‚Äôs local high set in late August at $2,820. A successful breakout above $2,800 would signal a strong bullish continuation, making a push toward higher levels imminent. However, if ETH fails to consolidate above $2,600, the risk of a retracement to lower demand zones becomes increasingly likely.

The cryptocurrency is again approaching a significant resistance level at $170, which has posed a challenge for the token over the past month. Despite the recent fluctuations, bullish sentiment surrounding Solana remains strong among analysts. Many are projecting new all-time highs above its previous record of $259,¬†set in November 2021. Analysts Eye Potential Bullish Breakout In the past 24 hours, Solana has rebounded nearly 3%, although trading volume has dipped by about 2%, according to data from CoinGecko. This decline in volume indicates that despite some profit-taking, bullish investors continue to show interest, particularly after the recent retracement. Related Reading: Solana Eyes New All-Time High Of $370 After Cup And Handle Breakout Crypto analyst Byzantine General has noted that buying pressure appears to be strengthening at lower support levels, with traders eager to capitalize on dips experienced by the Solana price in the short term. Looking at the bullish predictions, Captain Faibik recently suggested in a social media post on X (formerly Twitter) that Solana is poised for a ‚Äúbullish pennant‚Äù breakout following a prolonged consolidation period observed on the 3-day SOL/USDT chart. Faibik believes that a successful breakout from this pattern could propel Solana to a new all-time high of $400 within the current bullish cycle, expected to last at least through the first quarter of 2025. However, this forecast is somewhat conservative compared to the more audacious prediction from market expert Crow. How The Solana Price Could Reach $800 In a separate social media post, Crow indicated that the Solana price could surge by approximately 400% during this bull run, recalling the previous price actions of the 2021 uptrend. The expert highlighted that the last bull cycle featured two distinct phases: the rise from $3 to $50 and another jump from $25 to $250. He notes that Solana has progressed from $16 to $200 this time, and he foresees a possible climb from $200 to $800. Despite the bullish predictions, it is important to recognize that bull cycles do not typically progress in a straight line. Historical data illustrates this point, with Solana experiencing significant retracements of over 20% on August 5 and September 6, respectively. Related Reading: Here‚Äôs Why The Bitcoin Price Saw Sharp Crash Below $67,000 To navigate these fluctuations effectively, it is essential to analyze SOL‚Äôs daily chart and identify key support levels that, if maintained by bullish investors, could help prevent further declines. In the event of a deeper correction, the first crucial support level to watch is the $160 mark. Additional support levels are identified at $153 and $145. The most significant support, however, is located in the $127 zone. This level has proven resilient throughout the token‚Äôs consolidation phase in past months, effectively halting further price declines and safeguarding the critical $100 mark.

The initial announcement of the stock acquisition rights was on Aug. 6, when Metaplanet‚Äôs share price stood around 700 yen. It gave shareholders the option to purchase new shares at a discounted rate of 555 yen per share.  Metaplanet adopted bitcoin as a reserve asset in May as it aimed to hedge against volatility in the yen. The company now holds 861.4 BTC, according to bitcointreasuries.net and its shares up up 642% year-to-date.  The stock acquisition rights were issued with no charge to shareholders; for each common stock held, shareholders received one stock acquisition right. The stock acquisition rights period started on Sept. 6 and concluded on Oct. 15, giving shareholders the time to exercise their rights or let them expire.  During this period, of the total 18.1 million stock rights issued, 72.8% were exercised by the shareholders, which was the equivalent of 13,774 individuals. As a result, 13.2 million shares were issued while raising 7.32 billion yen ($48.5 million).

He recommended owning a basket of gold, bitcoin, commodities and Nasdaq, and staying away from fixed income.

""I think all roads lead to inflation,"" he said. ""I'm long gold, long bitcoin."" Tudor added that he would short fixed income, particularly longer duration paper.  His comments about the fiscal situation echoed similar warnings from other major public figures, with even Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell noting that U.S. debt levels are untenable. Tudor's fellow legendary investor Stanley Druckenmiller recently also disclosed betting against U.S. government bonds.  The U.S. is at an ""incredible moment in history,"" said Tudor, with the national debt ballooning to nearly 100% of GDP now from 40% only 25 years ago. Whoever will be elected next month will have to deal with the issue, he added, but campaign promises of additional spending and tax cuts made by Harris and Trump would only exacerbate the problem.  ""We are going to be broke really quick unless we get serious about dealing with our spending issues,"" he said.  The only playbook to get out of the situation is to inflate and outgrow the debt burden, argued Jones. In this case, the Federal Reserve ""should be easy"" running nominal interest rates lower than inflation and supporting nominal economic growth above inflation.

""Tokenisation could have implications for financial stability if it scales up significantly,"" Klaas Knot the FSB chair said in a letter addressing the Group of 20 nations.  The Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) both highlighted in recent reports what they see as risks from tokenization and called for more regulation.  Tokenization is the digitization of real world assets including securities that often involves distributed ledger technology. The FSB, which monitors and makes recommendations for the financial system, identified three vulnerabilities of tokenization: ""The underlying ‚Äúreference asset‚Äù that has been tokenised; the participants in DLT based tokenisation projects; and new technology as well as its interaction with legacy systems,"" its report said on Tuesday.  ""Tokenisation could have implications for financial stability if it scales up significantly, if it is used to create complex and opaque products that trade in an automated fashion, and if identified vulnerabilities are not adequately addressed through oversight, regulation, supervision, and enforcement"" Klaas Knot the FSB chair said in a letter addressing the Group of 20 nations. The FSB also released an update on its crypto roadmap that said most countries had implemented its measures for the sector but warned against inconsistencies.  Nations around the world have been exploring tokenization. The FSB highlighted tokenization as a priority for monitoring earlier in the year. Meanwhile, more than 40 firms joined the BIS, to explore tokenization for cross border payments in September.  The BIS, the global standard-setter for banking regulation, issued a report on Monday with its Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures to the G20.  The BIS report noted that tokenization could have numerous benefits such as reducing frictions from using different systems to trade assets but it added that existing system risks like credit and liquidity risks and cyber risks could apply to tokenization.  ""These risks may materialise in different ways due to the effects of token arrangements on market structure, e.g. due to a change in the roles played by intermediaries when previously separate functions are combined on one platform,"" the BIS report said.

35012288,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649215,1729609226,"Here‚Äôs Why The Bitcoin Price Saw Sharp Crash Below $67,000","The Bitcoin price briefly crashed below $67,000 on October 21, although it quickly reclaimed this level as support before the daily close. This price decline is believed to be due to its correlation with the stock market, which also experienced a drop of its own. Why The Bitcoin Price Dropped Below $67,000 The Bitcoin price dropped below $67,000 primarily thanks to its correlation to the US stock market. IntoTheBlock data shows that the correlation between the flagship crypto and the S&P 500 is currently at 0.63, which indicates a strong positive price correlation. The S&P 500 and Dow index dropped from their record highs on October 21 ahead of earnings reports. Related Reading: Machine Learning Algorithm Predicts XRP Price Direction For This Week, What To Expect The stock market drop and the Bitcoin price crash are believed to be driven by uncertainty in the macro environment. This market uncertainty stems from the rising inflation expectations and concerns about how government spending is contributing to this development. As such, market participants are currently cautious about their next move, with some waiting to see what steps the US Federal Reserve will take to keep inflation within their 2% target. The upcoming US election has also contributed to the market‚Äôs uncertainty, especially with the presidential race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris looking to be a tight one. It isn‚Äôt unusual for traders to wait on the sidelines until after the elections to gain certainty about the market outlook under the new President. Other Factors Contributing To The Price Crash Analyst Justin Bennett cited the ‚Äúopen interest (OI) being at July highs, whales trimming longs and the last week‚Äôs perp-driven rally‚Äù as other factors contributing to the Bitcoin price crash. He claimed that these factors alongside the upcoming US elections are what caused the price crash. Regarding the impact of the US election, the analyst noted that the markets usually derisk ahead of the US presidential election, which is now thirteen days away. He remarked that it would have been a ‚Äúcalamity‚Äù if the markets didn‚Äôt derisk ahead of time and continued to pump into election night. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Prediction: Crypto Analyst Says Things Are ‚ÄòAbout To Get Interesting‚Äô Bennett made this statement while noting why he had anticipated a pullback for Bitcoin and other crypto assets. Indeed, the analyst has since last week been stating that the flagship crypto would soon experience a price correction. He had before now mentioned that he wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the BTC price corrects to around $63,000. In a more recent X post, he highlighted the $65,800 range as the first test for the Bitcoin price. A hold above this level could invalidate his trade setup. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $67,700, down almost 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The company‚Äôs revenue from product support remains strong, while subscription services show growth, indicating deepening client commitment despite a decline in product license sales. Bitcoin investments since 2020 have heavily influenced Net Income and EPS, with recent trends showing high correlation between MicroStrategy's stock and Bitcoin prices. MicroStrategy's forward outlook hinges on its role in the decentralized digital economy, with new blockchain initiatives like ""MicroStrategy Orange"" potentially driving future growth. American tech veteran MicroStrategy Incorporated ( MSTR ), headquartered in Tysons Corner, Virginia, has been a member of the business intelligence (BI) and mobile software industry since its founding in 1989. The company went on to increase its revenues by at least 100% from 1990 through 1996 before listing on American bourses on June 11, 1998. In its annual report, the company identifies its dominant competitors as being global independent software vendors (ISVs) such as IBM ( IBM ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), Oracle ( ORCL ), Salesforce ( CRM ), and SAP ( SAP ). It was also a somewhat-early innovator in the mobile space when it began deploying business intelligence software for mobile platforms, such as the iPhone and iPad, in 2010. After over 35 years in the industry, the company has been seeking new horizons by attempting to carve out a new niche by developing business applications in the decentralized blockchain space. However, many investors might know the company as a predominant holder of Bitcoin ( BTC ) given that it holds over 1% of all Bitcoin available as of the 20 th of October 2024. The basis for its holdings stems from what could be considered by some to be an idiosyncratic decision by its principals but it is hardly alone: EV carmaker Tesla and payments company Block Inc (formerly Square, Inc) also feature in the Top 10 list of public companies holding Bitcoin: Source: Created by Sandeep G. Rao using data from CoinGecko While this decision has some consequences for the company‚Äôs bottom line, it is arguably unfair to consider the company to just be a proxy for Bitcoin. With the company‚Äôs earnings release scheduled on the 30 th of October, the company‚Äôs business item trends must bear being examined. Fiscal Trend Drilldown The company‚Äôs software and services ‚Äì also called ‚ÄúMicroStrategy‚Äù ‚Äì has gone through numerous iterations and upgrades. It generates revenues for the company through three means: the sale of subscriptions for usage, product support for clients and product licenses. Source: Created by Sandeep G. Rao using data from MicroStrategy's Financial Statements In full Fiscal Year (FY) terms, there have been some interesting trends. ‚ÄúProduct Support‚Äù ‚Äì required of all product licenses holders to enable both technical support and when-and-if-available software upgrades ‚Äì was and still remains its main driver of revenue but there has been a slightly pronounced softening of growth trends over the past two years. Meanwhile, ‚ÄúSubscription Services‚Äù ‚Äì wherein the company sells access to its software through a cloud subscription service without transferring control of the software itself ‚Äì went from being third place in 2018 to second place from 2023. The sale of ‚ÄúProduct Licenses‚Äù themselves going into a downtrend over the past two years juxtaposed with the trend seen in ‚ÄúSubscription Services‚Äù is indicative of a possible current trend of existing clients deepening their commitment to the company‚Äôs platform. Despite product licenses prospectively being higher than subscription services, overall impact on revenue is fairly balanced, with a slight softening in revenue growth trends. After a massive burst in operating expenses in 2021, operating expenses had seen a substantial improvement in 2023. However, the cost of revenue in FY 2023 had seen a less-dramatic increase over the previous two years. In the YTD encompassing the first half (H1) of the current year, total revenue is trending towards closing the year 8% below FY 2023's. While there is a slowdown in the potentially costlier product licenses is flagging, revenue from subscription licenses continues to show strong growth, indicating that product usage continues to deepen among the existing client base. Product support revenue continues to be relatively healthy, indicating sustained usage of services by the existing client base. As of FY 2023 as well as in the YTD, Net Income and Earnings Per Share ((EPS)), however, had a massive shift that aren‚Äôt entirely aligned with revenue and cost growth trends. This is mostly driven by an interesting choice in the company‚Äôs financial holdings in 2020. Consequences of and Rationale for Holding Bitcoin While the pandemic raged around the world, MicroStrategy ‚Äì then led by CEO Michael Saylor ‚Äì invested $250 million in Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset in August 2020, citing declining returns from cash, a weakening dollar, and other global macroeconomic factors. Overall, the total value of digital assets purchased in FY 2020 is listed as being $1.125 billion. The value of digital assets purchased in FY 2021 was more than twice this value in FY 2022. In terms of total dollars earned as revenue, the value of digital assets purchased ‚Äì along with possible costs of holding in terms of margins, etc. ‚Äì has nearly always outstripped revenues for every year except FY 2022: Source: Created by Sandeep G. Rao using data from MicroStrategy's Financial Statements The effect on the company‚Äôs Net Income ‚Äì and thereby EPS ‚Äì is nearly immediately discernible from FY 2020 onwards. Given that Bitcoin‚Äôs value trended up by 156% in 2023, Net Income returned to a net positive hitherto seen in the year prior to the company‚Äôs Bitcoin conviction, i.e. 2019, despite an outlay of $1.9 billion for digital asset purchases. In the YTD, where Bitcoin prices have gone up by over 51%, purchases of digital assets already surpassed the outlay for the entire previous year by 27%. Total value ascribed to digital asset purchase is almost 11 times the revenue earned over the first six months of 2024. Can it be Considered a Proxy for Bitcoin? Since some investors hold the claim that the company‚Äôs stock is a proxy for Bitcoin given its massive holdings, an examination of market sentiment to verify said claim would be in order. Utilizing a tactical investment strategy, a rolling 15-day correlation framework is employed on the historical prices of three assets: the company‚Äôs stock ((MSTR)), the Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ) and the broad market S&P 500 ( SPX ). Source: Created by Sandeep G. Rao using data from Yahoo! Finance In the sum total of the trading days available in each year, the stock‚Äôs correlation with the S&P 500 has been greater than 0.5 (‚Äú50% - 80%‚Äù and ‚Äú> 80%‚Äù) for more than half the year in both before its Bitcoin adoption strategy, i.e. 2019, as well as the Year Till Date (YTD). The stock has been negatively correlated (‚Äú On the other hand, the stock‚Äôs correlation with BTC was greater than 0.5 for a little under a third of the year in 2019 and this has certainly risen to an astounding 85% of the YTD. However, this needs to be taken into context: the index itself showed a correlation greater than 0.5 with BTC for only 26% of the traded days in 2019 and then rose to a massive 71% in 2022. In the YTD, roughly half the trading days have seen the index displaying a correlation greater than 0.5. The number of days wherein negative correlation was seen dropped by 40% in the YTD relative to 2019. Meanwhile, the stock itself shows a correlation greater than 0.5 with the index for about 60% of the YTD, which is nearly the same as in 2019. Given its massive holdings in BTC, some investor conviction imparted on the stock‚Äôs valuation is likely to be driven by BTC‚Äôs price trends. However, the correlation analysis indicates that if the stock can be considered a proxy for BTC, so can the S&P 500, despite the fact that a vanishingly small number of companies present in the index hold BTC in volumes that ‚Äì even when consolidated ‚Äì is nowhere close to what the company alone holds. Beyond the ‚ÄúMere‚Äù Value of Bitcoin The company‚Äôs Bitcoin holdings aren‚Äôt exactly sitting idle; its FY 2023 Annual Report stated that a portion of its holdings serve as part of the collateral securing the 2028 Secured Notes, whereby the company raised capital for its activities from the market. This year, however, the company potentially revealed its use case for Bitcoin by aggressively pitching itself as a ""Bitcoin development company"" that would work on development of the Bitcoin network through financial markets, advocacy and innovation. As part of this new niche, the company announced plans to develop a decentralized identity service ‚ÄúMicroStrategy Orange‚Äù that will provide ""trustless, tamper-proof and long-lived"" decentralized identities using the Bitcoin blockchain via the issuance of decentralized identifiers (DIDs). These DIDs incorporate the idea of ‚Äúpseudonymity‚Äù typical of the blockchain network: while the IDs are largely consistent within the network, the identity of the user will be masked. One application as part of this new niche has already been developed: ""Orange For Outlook,"" which integrates digital signatures into emails to enable recipients to verify the identity of the sender. In many decentralized networks, BTC is used as a token of value to complete a chain of activity. Under the protocol being employed for the buildout of ‚ÄúOrange‚Äù, information is stored and communicated on individual satoshis ‚Äì the smallest increment of Bitcoin, equal to 1/100,000,000th of a BTC. Given that the company is among the largest corporate holders of BTC that isn‚Äôt a crypto miner, the company has substantial dry powder available to essentially corner a commanding presence in the steadily growing economy of decentralized networks. Thus, it is possible that the company‚Äôs BTC acquisition strategy had less to do with the idea that the cryptocurrency was a better storehouse of value than fiat currencies but one part of a new business buildout a long time in the making. While a substantial element of the company‚Äôs forward outlook is likely being informed by its potential inherent within the decentralized digital economy, how large or how soon the latter grows is likely to be speculation for some time. In a similar vein, while BTC and its like are purportedly supposed to be resilient storehouses of value, they are treated as speculative instruments with trajectories often entirely independent of conviction or work-oriented networks where they are tokens. With the company‚Äôs ‚Äúregular‚Äù business showing early signs of flagging while their competitors remain firmly entrenched in market share, a new direction is always welcome. How this new direction remains to be seen. The stock has two ostensibly two entirely drivers for valuation and isn‚Äôt for the faint of heart. Despite a 10-for-1 split enacted earlier this year, the stock's fortunes are as wrapped up in the speculative volatility of BTC as much as its potential as a token of work in a new economy.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4728270-is-microstrategy-just-a-proxy-for-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/35011090.jpeg

The meme coin has jumped by over 30% during the past month, drawing both retail and analytical interest. Some analysts think SHIB may soon overcome a major resistance level with a community-driven rally bringing its market capitalization over $11 billion, therefore enabling even further gains. Related Reading: ApeCoin Climbs Over 100% On Major Tech Advancements ‚Äì Details This thrill is driven mostly by a prediction from a pseudonymous analyst called FOUR.

Previously tested during a late September rush, this pricing point was rejected. But SHIB‚Äôs present increasing momentum has rekindled hope that this barrier will soon be broken. Analysts contend that if SHIB surpasses this level, it could set off a quick price rise motivated by ongoing support from its large population. FOUR‚Äôs research fits this perspective. He points to the recent weekly candle close, implying that SHIB is getting closer to conquering its present obstacles. Shiba Inu might rapidly experience a notable increase in value if the resistance is overcome since the positive momentum has been growing. Retail Investors Promoting The Rally One may mostly credit Shiba Inu‚Äôs rise on the retail investor level. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that nearly 90% of SHIB holders are small investors holding anything from $0 to $1,000. The popularity of the coin has been driven by this grassroots support, hence increasing its resilience to changes in the market. The continuous rally can be attributed to retail investors believing in SHIB‚Äôs future for additional expansion. This is #SHIB analytics from #Coinmarketcap .

Scroll confirmed that all co-founders and team members would not be receiving an airdrop in response to criticism last week.  SCR has a market cap of $212 million and a fully diluted value of $1.1 billion.  Layer-2 network Scroll released its long-awaited native governance token on Tuesday, putting the project's initial valuation just over $200 million.  Traders priced SCR at around $1.10, or a $212 million market cap, based on the circulating supply figure of 190 million.  SCR will act as a native governance token with a roadmap to progress it towards being a protocol utility token as Scroll becomes more decentralized.  The week prior to SCR's release was far from ideal for Scroll as users complained about disproportionate token allocation and the decision to give Binance 5.5% of the supply for its Launchpool users.  Early users of the Scroll network also received SCR with 7% of the supply being set aside for an airdrop. But the token struggled to shrug off the negative sentiment it accrued in October as it dropped from $1.40 at 7:00am UTC to $1.12 at 12:45 UTC to mark an initial slump of 20%.  Scroll was hit by further skepticism last week after it emerged that the team had been accruing ""marks"" which technically could have been converted into airdropped tokens. However, Scroll's core contributor Sandy dispelled the rumors on X by stating that ""all Scroll co-founders and team members involved in developing scroll sessions or the airdrop will not be claiming the airdrop.""  On-chain data shows that the SCR token has accumulated more than 200,000 holders in its first day of release whilst racking up over 500,000 token transfers.  Trading volume remains steady with $189 million changing hands across all SCR trading pairs, according to CoinMarketCap.

42422052,lZj3zXFJWcbTdP3qeivrg4,1729603641,More Than Arbitrage: $2.5B Inflow in Spot BTC ETFs Features Bullish Directional Bets,"The mismatch between spot ETF inflows and the spike in CME futures open interest suggests bias for bullish directional bets, CF Benchmarks explained.  Elevated futures premium suggests the same, according to Bitwise.  If you are disappointed by bitcoin's {{BTC}} failure to get past $70,000, here is an insight that might brighten your day ‚Äì The recent strong uptake for the U.S.-listed spot ETFs, often considered a proxy for institutional activity, mainly featured bullish directional bets than arbitrage plays.  Since Oct. 14, the 11 spot BTC ETFs registered a cumulative net inflow of nearly $2.5 billion, the largest since March, according to data tracking website SoSoValue. Meanwhile, notional open interest or the dollar value of the active bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) surged to new record highs above $12 billion, according to data source VeloData.  Seasoned investors may see the concurrent rise in the two variables as a sign of continued institutional preference for cash and carry arbitrage, a non-directional strategy aimed at profiting from the price discrepancy between spot and futures prices. That was supposedly the case early this year, as institutions set up the so-called basis trade, involving a long ETF position and a short CME futures position, leaving bitcoin largely flat below $70,000.  The latest ETF inflows, however, indicate a bias for bullish plays via spot ETFs, according to Sui Chung, CEO of crypto index provider CF Benchmarks.  ""An increase in basis trading is usually apparent when the inflow into spot ETFs and growth in CME OI correspond with one another. But in this case, there's a clear mismatch with the $2.5 billion ETF flows far exceeding the $1.6 billion increase in open interest for CME's bitcoin futures contracts,"" Chung told CoinDesk.  ""This tells us that only a proportion (we estimate around 40%) of the ETF inflow is down to basis trading; the other 60% or $1.4 billion is directional holding,"" Chung added. Most bitcoin spot ETFs refer to CF Benchmarks' Bitcoin Reference Rate - New York (BRRNY) variant.  Futures premium spikes  The elevated futures premium also undercuts any notion of ETF inflows being driven by cash and carry trades. A mass deployment of the strategy typically ""arbs away"" the premium, limiting the price differential.  The annualized one-month BTC futures premium (basis) on the CME increased from roughly 6% to 13.9% last week, the highest since May, according to data tracked by K33 Research. The funding rates in perpetual markets also increased, suggesting a bias for bullish long trades.  ""The bitcoin basis rate [futures premium] has been moving up, implying a bias towards long positioning, which tends to steepen the futures curve and increase contango. The same is reflected in the perpetual funding rate, which has increased to the highest level since July 2024,"" Andr√© Dragosch, director, head of research - Europe at Bitwise, told CoinDesk.  ""Market makers like Jane Street tend to increase their BTC short positioning with increasing BTC ETF inventories; the latest evidence suggests that there has been a net increase in long positioning via futures and perpetuals more recently,"" Dragosch added.  That said, some market participants seem to have bought ETFs while shorting CME futures. In the week ended Oct. 15, non-commercials or large speculators held a net short position of 1872 contracts, the highest since March, according to data tracked by Tradingster.  ""The latest data on CME Bitcoin Futures Non-Commercial net positioning imply that futures traders are net short on CME. However, on aggregate across all kinds of futures exchanges, the data imply the opposite,"" Dragosch noted.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/22/more-than-arbitrage-25b-inflow-in-spot-btc-etfs-features-bullish-directional-bets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/da0c162eff618ed11c472672b3be14159b0731b1-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422038,lZj3zXFJWcbTdP3qeivrPx,1729602000,Buenos Aires Adds ZK Proofs to City App in Bid to Boost Residents' Privacy,"The Buenos Aires government has incorporated zero-knowledge proofs into its app for accessing city services.  ZK proofs allow users to prove something is true about a set of data without revealing that data, e.g. that they are of a certain age without giving their birthdate.  The technology is being tested in other jurisdictions, including Uruguay.  The city of Buenos Aires has launched a digital identity service designed to strengthen residents' privacy using zero-knowledge proofs, a type of cryptography that long predates but often bolsters cryptocurrencies.  The service, QuarkID, has been integrated into miBA, the city's seven-year-old app for accessing municipal services and documents. The idea, in short, is to give 3.6 million porte√±os ‚Äì residents of Buenos Aires ‚Äì greater control over their personal information. The ZK proofs will let users show that a document has indeed been authenticated by the government without disclosing information that is irrelevant to the task at hand.  For example, residents will be able to pull up the app on their phone to confirm they are over a certain age (for the purpose of, say, buying alcohol) without showing their address or even full birthdate.  ‚ÄúThe decision from the beginning was to create a self-sovereign identity system so that citizens can have privacy and security over the documents they acquire ownership of,‚Äù Diego Fernandez, Buenos Aires' secretary of innovation and digital transformation, told CoinDesk.  Zero-knowledge proofs do not require a blockchain to work, but QuarkID uses one: the Ethereum layer-2 network ZKsync Era. According to QuarkID's website, the blockchain serves as a ""security anchor,"" meaning that it's there to prove a piece of data existed in a particular form at a particular time. ""Relying solely on the issue date embedded within the credential data could be problematic, as a malicious issuer could backdate documents,"" Fernandez said.  More than 60 different types of documents ‚Äì including birth certificates, gross income tax certificates, and vaccination data ‚Äì can be uploaded to the app, and additional ones will be made available in the coming months, the city said.  No third party, not even the municipality of Buenos Aires, has any control over these documents, so porte√±os don‚Äôt have to worry about their information being hacked and released into the wild, according to the press release. The risk of identity theft is thus greatly reduced. And neither the government nor QuarkID can track the usage of these credentials, the release said.  ‚ÄúThere are no costs for users,‚Äù Fernandez said. ‚ÄúIn fact, it offers a massively reduced cost for the government over traditional methods.‚Äù  The experiment extends beyond Buenos Aires. Pilots are in the works in various Argentinian regions, with Jujuy and Tucum√°n rolling out the technology on a larger scale. Luj√°n de Cuyo, a small town in the Mendoza region, is also experimenting on the municipal level.  ‚ÄúThe city of Buenos Aires and the national government have an IP-sharing agreement, so any technology developed and implemented in the capital city can be shared with the national government,‚Äù Fernandez said. ‚ÄúWe intend to implement and test this in Buenos Aires, and we hope that then we can scale nationally.‚Äù  Experiments are taking place in other Latin American countries including Uruguay, Fernandez said.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY | ZK,Tom Carreras,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/10/22/buenos-aires-adds-zk-proofs-to-city-app-in-bid-to-boost-residents-privacy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cb32b3cfb7a04cdf48e2f6c9fbf836fbcd165eda-1920x1440.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Its new leaders want to start turning a profit.  The hub for crypto apps' voting, decision-making and treasury is under new management, an entity called ""Realms Today Trust."" It's a big change for the project built by all-important Solana Labs to give its blockchains' many startups a place to manage their politics.  ""We need to develop profit services, that way we can continue it,"" said Dean Pappas, a longtime Realms contributor and one of the four people leading the spinoff company.  Realms' new ""mandate"" won't impact the ""public goods"" that dozens of Solana-based decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) have come to rely on, continued Pappas. The governance tools that give projects' communities of token-holders a say in their operations will remain free.  Other new bells and whistles will not. Realms is launching a crypto-advisory service to help DAOs set up their governance structures. An incorporation-advisory line will help them create legal structures and bank accounts. And there will be a credit card through which they can spend down their crypto-treasuries.  All that might help Realms capture some of the $1.5 billion in crypto that DAOs have parked on its infrastructure.  Realms also plans to give away $200,000 in grants to Solana DAOs in support of upstart DAOs. Pappas declined to say where that money was coming from.  New ownership  Realms isn't the first piece of the Solana ecosystem to emerge from Solana Labs, the blockchain's main developer company. Metaplex, the entity underpinning Solana's non-fungible token (NFT) technology also did, said Matty Taylor, himself a Labs veteran who went on to independently run hackathons for the entire ecosystem.  ""The general ethos of Solana Labs is once things get to a certain point, it's time for it"" to become its own standalone thing, Pappas said.  Realms' new legal entity is owned outright by former Solana Labs' DAO engineer Sebastain Bor, according to U.K. business records from late 2023. The company Realms Today LTD later added Pappas and Jose Neif Jury from BCB Group as directors.  Asked if Bor had to purchase Realms from Labs, Pappas declined to comment.  The Realms team currently has 12 full time employees and plans to grow further. They're slated to build more frontends for different tokenized governance use-cases, a change from what Pappas called the current website's ""one size fits all"" approach.  Changes may also be coming to elements of Solana's governance standard for SPL tokens. That codebase is open-source and accessible to anyone.

Over 5,550 addresses issued 7,500 tokens in the past 24 hours alone, data shows. Monday saw a record 31,000 tokens launched as artificial intelligence-themed memecoins - a niche kickstarted by GOAT - renewed a speculative frenzy.  Active addresses grew to 85,000, of which 37,000 were new wallets, indicative of strong demand. Meanwhile, Lookonchain data shows that Pump‚Äôs creators are raking in profits. A connected fee account sold over $6 million worth of SOL late Monday, taking its lifetime sales to over $78 million or 500,000 SOL.  Pump lets anyone issue a token for less than $2 in capital, after which they choose the number of tokens, theme, and meme picture to accompany it. When the market capitalization of any token reaches $69,000, a portion of liquidity is deposited to the Solana-based exchange Raydium and burned.  Pump is also available on Base and Blast networks but is most commonly used to issue memecoins on Solana. That has minted the project big money. Pump has earned $147 million since going live and is among the most profitable crypto upstarts.

The decline comes as a continued uptick in the U.S. Treasury yields dents the appeal of riskier assets. ETH and XRP have both fallen more than 3%, while SOL and DOGE are around 1.65% and 2.35% respectively. The CoinDesk 20 Index, which offers a weighted measurement of the broader crypto market, is down more than 2%. Over $165 million in longs were liquidated across crypto futures tracking major tokens in a sign of a leverage flush, according to data by Coinglass. The use of leverage spiked over the weekend in a move that historically precedes market volatility.  Stripe's acquisition of crypto startup Bridge ""validates"" the use of stablecoins for public blockchains, broker Bernstein said in a new research report. Stripe - finalized the purchase of Bridge in a $1.1 billion deal, demonstrating ""stablecoins [are] the leading use case for blockchains, particularly for cross-border payments,"" Bernstein analysts wrote. Bernstein noted that the Bridge deal is the largest crypto acquisition by a major payments company to date. Companies such as Bridge ""play an important role by building API software for businesses to integrate stablecoin payments within their regular payments experience,"" the authors wrote. It's hard to see a more disruptive challenge to the TradFi banking system, ""payments at scale without the involvement of a bank,"" the report added.  The APE ecosystem and native token's launch has been met with a bullish response from options traders on crypto derivatives platform PowerTrade. Open interest surged by over 800% to 263,000 ($394.5K) in one day, PowerTrade told CoinDesk, adding that call options or derivatives account for over 80% of the tally. Most activity is concentrated on the Oct. 22 and Oct. 25 expiry contracts, with traders buying higher strike calls at strikes as high as $2.2 or nearly 50% higher than APE's going market price. The activity in APE options is noteworthy, considering the token has a market capitalization of just $1 billion. That said, open interest and volume are way lower than the billions of dollars locked in BTC and ETH options contracts listed on Deribit.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note surging in lockstep with Republican candidate Donald Trump's election victory odds.  Trump has pledged to impose tariffs on imports, including a 60% fee on Chinese goods coming to the U.S., which, if passed, could add to domestic inflation, making it harder for the Fed to cut rates.  The elevated yield dents the appeal of investing in riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies.

35006536,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649193,1729598432,Top Crypto Analyst Unveils Strategy To ‚ÄòMake Millions‚Äô By March 2025,"Crypto analyst Miles Deutscher, boasting 550,000 followers on X, has released a new video titled ‚ÄúMy Plan To Make Millions In Crypto By March 2025! [Fool Proof Strategy].‚Äù In this analysis, Deutscher outlines his strategic approach to navigating the current crypto bull run. The Start Of The Bitcoin Bull Run First, Deutscher highlights the bullish outlook for Bitcoin, particularly on the monthly chart. ‚ÄúWe have been consolidating above the high that we made in 2021 in February for a matter of eight months now,‚Äù he notes. ‚ÄúOn the higher time frames, Bitcoin looks really, really good. It honestly looks primed for expansion for another leg potentially to take us to that $100,000 zone.‚Äù He attributes this bullish consolidation to significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, signaling increased interest from traditional finance investors. ‚ÄúOver $2 billion worth of inflows into the Bitcoin ETFs last week,‚Äù Deutscher reports. ‚ÄúWe also saw, to end the week, another additional $273 million flowing into the Bitcoin ETF. The landscape is very strong here for Bitcoin from a TradFi perspective.‚Äù Despite this momentum, Bitcoin is lagging behind gold, which has surged 30% above its yearly high to $2,700 per ounce. ‚ÄúBitcoin is still sitting 10% below its yearly high,‚Äù Deutscher points out. ‚ÄúIf Bitcoin were to catch up to the current price performance of gold this year, that would indicate a Bitcoin price of $96,400, which would be absolutely insane.‚Äù Related Reading: Crypto Craze: Investor Nets A 3,360% Gain, Turning $86,000 Into $3.75 Million Deutscher also discusses the potential impact of macroeconomic factors and political events on Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory. He observes a correlation between Bitcoin‚Äôs price performance and the election odds of former President Donald Trump. ‚ÄúIt is quite interesting that Bitcoin is behaving very similarly to the Trump election odds based on Polymarket,‚Äù he remarks. While he acknowledges this could be coincidental, he suggests that ‚Äúthe market is anticipating a Trump win to be bullish for Bitcoin.‚Äù He also references the transition from quantitative tightening to quantitative easing and its potential effect on the crypto market. Citing a tweet, he poses the question: ‚ÄúWhat do you think happens when you leave a seven, actually eight-month trading range off a low historical volatility into an election with a transition from quantitative tightening to quantitative easing and at the end phase of an 18.6-year real estate cycle?‚Äù His answer: ‚ÄúExplosion.‚Äù Strategy How To ‚ÄúMake Millions‚Äù Turning his focus to altcoins, Deutscher provides a strategy for capitalizing on emerging market trends to potentially ‚Äúmake millions by March 2025.‚Äù He emphasizes the importance of strategic accumulation during market dips and highlights the significance of current uptrends. ‚ÄúAlts are now uptrending. We have started to break above the range. Bitcoin is uptrending. We are starting to break above key levels and make higher highs,‚Äù he explains. Deutscher advises against attempting to time market rotations between Bitcoin and altcoins. ‚ÄúYou can play the game of timing the Bitcoin dominance rotation,‚Äù he acknowledges, but cautions that it requires precise timing. Instead, he recommends positioning for the ‚Äúend game‚Äù by holding altcoins that are poised to outperform Bitcoin in the latter stages of its move. ‚ÄúAlthough that means I‚Äôm going to have to hold throughout periods of altcoin underperformance by the end of the cycle, I‚Äôm going to make more money playing that game,‚Äù he asserts. He stresses the importance of focusing on strong narratives and being selective with investments. Quoting Warren Buffett, he notes, ‚ÄúDiversification is a protection against ignorance. It makes very little sense for those who know what they‚Äôre doing.‚Äù Deutscher elaborates: ‚ÄúI think you should be selective. You don‚Äôt want to be over-diversified to the point where you hold six AI coins, six RWA coins, eight meme coins, five Layer-1s, three Layer-2s. This is a market where you‚Äôre better off to have maybe two plays from each narrative and just go higher conviction into those coins.‚Äù Key Narratives and Top Altcoin Picks Deutscher identifies several hot crypto narratives and specific altcoins that he believes have the potential to yield significant profits. In the memecoin sector, Deutscher highlights the emergence of AI-driven meme coins, where AI agents create and promote tokens. His leading play in this space is GOAT. ‚ÄúThis narrative either goes to billions and really takes off and GOAT could be a one-billion-plus coin, or it goes to zero,‚Äù he admits, acknowledging the high risk involved. Besides AI memecoins, Deutscher recommends looking at the memecoin list by Murad Mahmudov. ‚ÄúI do think SPX6900 is a decent play. I also like GIGA, but probably not as much as SPX. I also like MOG. I like pretty much all of these but I think, you just gotta pick two or three that you resonate with the most.‚Äù Related Reading: Crypto Investment Products See Record $2.2 Billion Inflows‚ÄîIs The Bull Run Here? Beyond meme coins, Deutscher is heavily investing in AI projects. He has taken positions in tokens like Bittensor and Near Protocol. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm meeting two to three AI founders a day. I‚Äôm really digging deep into AI research because it‚Äôs one of the verticals that I‚Äôm most interested in right now,‚Äù he shares. Deutscher also revealed his investments in projects that tokenize real-world assets, such as Mantra (OM), Ondo Finance (ONDO), and Pendle. While he has started taking profits from these investments due to significant gains, he is reallocating into projects like Clearpool (CPOOL), which he believes can ‚Äúpush up into that top-five echelon of RWA protocols.‚Äù He hints at another RWA project he‚Äôs bullish on but hasn‚Äôt publicly disclosed yet. Deutscher emphasizes the importance of accumulating crypto positions during market dips, especially in sectors poised for growth. He notes that the current market phase rewards dip buyers. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in this new paradigm where we are getting higher lows. The market is actually rewarding those that buy these dips and take advantage of the dips,‚Äù he observes. He underscores the need for adaptability and disciplined risk management to maximize profits and potentially make millions. ‚ÄúYou need to be evolving in the market in order to be profitable, and you need to be condensing positions that maybe aren‚Äôt so great or sexy or attractive for this next run into positions that are attractive,‚Äù he advises. Deutscher also cautions against fixating on arbitrary price targets or portfolio milestones. ‚ÄúPrice targets are stupid,‚Äù he asserts. ‚ÄúThe number one way that people wreck themselves last cycle was attaching themselves to arbitrary numbers like, ‚ÄòOh, when I hit a million dollars, then I‚Äôll cash out,‚Äô or ‚ÄòOh, when Bitcoin hits 100K, then I‚Äôll cash out.'‚Äù Instead, he recommends implementing an incremental profit-taking system. ‚ÄúFor each coin that you buy, have a plan to shift out set percentages at certain multiples,‚Äù he suggests. ‚ÄúThis approach allows investors to secure gains progressively and adjust to market conditions without the need to predict exact peaks.‚Äù At press time, Bitcoin traded at $67,347.

42422036,lZj3zXFJWcbTdP3qeivrOA,1729598400,Gary Gensler's Contentious Reign Over Crypto Approaches Its Twilight,"Most Securities and Exchange Commission chiefs step down after a new president arrives, and for the crypto industry, Chair Gary Gensler's final moment is a point of high interest.  Digital assets leaders have battled him in court, and their friends in Congress have attacked Gensler for standing in the way of innovation, but his time is running low.  Gensler has options for how he wants to end things, and he still has some time left to engage in crypto policy and enforcement before he goes.  Someday soon, somebody besides Gary Gensler will be calling the shots at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and most of the crypto industry will rejoice.  More than any other figure in the U.S. government, this SEC chair played an unflinching antagonist to its aims. That no-holds-barred opposition to the way crypto companies want to do business is likely to cease, one way or another, in the coming year, when the securities agency gets a new boss.  But the countdown for Gensler raises a number of questions, leaving one final chapter of drama in his reign over crypto (and the rest of securities regulation in the U.S.). And if there's a common feeling among those who watch the SEC closely, it's uncertainty.  Gensler's five-year SEC term expires on Jan. 5, 2026, but tradition suggests a chair will step away if the opposing party takes the White House. Still, they don't have to. A second term for President Donald Trump doesn't mark an automatic end to Gensler's tenure. If he decided to make a stand, he could finish out his term as a commissioner and maintain a Democratic majority at the agency for as long as it takes for the new president to make appointments and the Senate to confirm them.  When recently asked by a reporter whether he'd resign if Trump won, Gensler laughed quietly and said he wouldn't comment on the elections. But he added, ""Elections have consequences.""  A former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker and Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor who lectured on crypto, Gensler has a deep well of financial and even digital-assets knowledge. And as the chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission after the global mortgage implosion in 2008, he cut his government teeth crafting novel, high-stakes regulation. But when he took the helm of the SEC in 2021 and found crypto on his plate, he made a consequential call: The SEC didn't need new rules. Existing securities law gave plenty of leeway to police this space.  That's not the general sense of the SEC's overseers in Congress. A big majority of the House of Representatives passed a bill earlier this year that would create rules specifically tailored for digital assets ‚Äì including how the SEC should approach what would be a more explicitly defined array of crypto securities. And while that bill has languished because it still needs approval in the Senate, crypto did see a win in that chamber, too. A strong majority of senators voted this year to overturn a key SEC crypto accounting policy, showing they believed the agency was overreaching and rebuffing Gensler's arguments that the industry-targeting standard was a natural response to the crypto sector's investor-harming bankruptcies.  The lawmakers who make up next year's Congress, which will likely have at least two dozen members who can partly thank aggressive crypto campaign giving for their presence on Capitol Hill, is likely to be busy with digital assets. That's probably true no matter which party controls each chamber; Democrats look poised to have a majority in the House, according to electoral math and polling trends, while Republicans may win control of the Senate. But if the Democrats keep the Senate, crypto progress may remain challenged.  ""I think there is a real chance that the legislation gets passed next year,"" Michael Piwowar, a former acting chair of the SEC, said during an interview with CoinDesk. That would create a ""nice, legal regulatory framework"" for crypto that puts the securities agency in a defined lane that leaves less room for the legal interpretations the SEC and crypto businesses are still fighting over in federal courts, he added. ""There's not clear authority on some of these things, which is why Congress needs to get involved.""  ""Five years from now, we'll look back in the rearview mirror and say, 'Why couldn't we have done this sooner?'"" Piwowar said.  Part of that answer ‚Äì critics and allies would agree ‚Äì is Gensler.  ""Chair Gensler‚Äôs tenure at the SEC has been marked by missed opportunities,"" said Sheila Warren, who runs the Crypto Council for Innovation. She argued that Gensler has left U.S. businesses ""operating in the dark"" by leaning into enforcement rather than regulation. ""A fresh start at the SEC is essential for the future of innovation in this country.""  Regulation-by-enforcement  SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, a Republican appointee who has been the most reliable crypto ally at the agency, has long been in open disagreement with the chairman's preference for whipping digital assets businesses into line by punishing them.  ""It's a very bad approach to trying to regulate an industry, if you're trying to protect investors, if you're trying to shepherd the commission's resources well,"" she told lawmakers at a hearing of the House Financial Services Committee last month. ""It's very inefficient, and at the end of the day, it leaves everyone wondering where the lines of our authority are.""  But in the same hearing, Gensler again cited the so-called Howey test, the Supreme Court standard set in the 1940s (long before crypto and blockchains were even a dream) that decides whether an asset is a security. He's wielded it as his chief weapon in the SEC's epic enforcement battle with the industry.  ""The time-tested protections are really important,"" he told the lawmakers, citing some of the recent federal court successes for his agency, while leaving out the setbacks. ""One court said Howey provides clearly expressed tests for determining what constitutes an investment contract. Another court said the SEC based its claim on straightforward application of a venerable Supreme Court precedent. I could go on and on and read quote after quote from cases in the crypto field.""  Most of the crypto space is breaking the law, according to the narrative he stands by, and its practitioners are threatening people's money with dicey business practices while they continue to evade compliance. Just last week, the SEC sued one of the biggest trading firms in financial markets (crypto and traditional assets alike), Chicago-based DRW, accusing the company of not getting proper permission to trade crypto assets. Gensler, who declined to be interviewed by CoinDesk for this story, has drawn that line in the sand and has spent years proving he won't budge from it.  ""The U.S. securities laws have worked to protect investors for 90 years, and there‚Äôs nothing incompatible about the crypto field with these time-tested laws,"" an SEC spokesperson told CoinDesk.  So, what happens to Gensler and his crypto campaign after the presidential election next month?  Former President Trump, the Republican candidate for next month's election, basked in a massive surge of applause in July when he told attendees at a Bitcoin conference that he'd fire Gensler, so a Trump win would promise storm clouds for the SEC chair. When the opposing party takes the White House, an SEC chair usually steps down right away or ‚Äì at the latest ‚Äì when the new president takes office two months after Election Day.  ""I don't think there's ever been a chairman who's ever stayed on when there's been a change of party,"" said Dennis Kelleher, CEO of Better Markets, a Washington-based advocacy group that's been critical of the hazards crypto poses to investors. (A Democrat, Joe Biden, currently resides in the White House.)  Could linger  But Jaret Seiberg, a financial-policy analyst with TD Cowen, suggests that Gensler ‚Äì even if he vacates the top job ‚Äì could stick around on the commission, where he'd sit alongside Democrats Caroline Crenshaw and Jaime Liz√°rraga. Crenshaw's term has expired, and President Biden sent her re-appointment to the Senate, but she hasn't yet been confirmed as the congressional session winds down. (In the absence of a replacement, an expired commissioner can stay on another 18 months.)  ""Nothing forces him to leave,"" Seiberg wrote in an analyst note to clients in September. ""We expect progressives to pressure Gensler to preserve Democratic policy wins by depriving the GOP of an SEC majority.""  Kelleher, who said he'd be ""more than pleased"" if Gensler stayed on, sees strong odds against that scenario playing out.  ""There would be tremendous value in Gary Gensler staying until the end of his term,"" Kelleher said. ""Based on precedent and practice, it's extremely unlikely.""  Without Gensler as chair, Trump could elevate either Republican commissioner ‚Äì Peirce or Mark Uyeda ‚Äì as acting chair while he seeks a permanent pick. That interim chair could start naming new department heads, including atop Gensler's cudgel ‚Äì the enforcement division ‚Äì and could change how the agency is pursuing pending legal cases. But until the commission has a third Republican confirmed, the Republicans wouldn't enjoy a majority that allows them to roll out new policies.  The crypto masses have generally favored a Trump presidency, especially after his full-throated embrace of the technology this year, though the U.S. government's adversarial relationship with the sector arguably started on his watch. It was his own SEC chair, Jay Clayton, who first pursued Ripple. Still, his recent rhetoric paints the government as standing in the way of innovation.  ""If Trump wins, crypto wins,"" Daniel Gallagher, a former SEC commissioner, predicted when appearing at a recent event in Washington. Gallagher, whose name has appeared on lists of those who might be considered for replacing Gensler under Trump, has often spoken of his frustration as a senior lawyer at Robinhood Markets. He said the agency rebuffed the company as it tried to comply with SEC rules as a crypto platform.  If Vice President Kamala Harris beats Trump, the replacement of Gensler potentially carries less urgency. But even her guarded sentiments that her presidency would foster digital assets growth and new regulations suggest a course that diverges from Gensler, who argues his agency doesn't need new regulations.  Harris' campaign has held meetings with crypto insiders and privately convinced them that the vice president would reset industry relations that have ranged from stagnant to hostile under her current boss, Biden.  Either way, the ""age of Gary Gensler"" will soon end, declared Anthony Scaramucci, Trump's short-lived communications director who has become a vigorous critic of the former president.  ""That era of crypto is ending,"" Scaramucci, the founder and managing partner at Skybridge Capital, said in a CoinDesk TV interview. ""We're heading toward a much better regulatory framework no matter who wins the election.""  Time left  Still, Gensler has some time left before the elections force his hand. Despite grumbling from the industry that his agency has refused to make rules tailored to crypto, he did set and defend crypto accounting policy in the form of what's known as Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121, and the commission embarked on a few consequential rules.  In February, the agency formally widened its definition for what makes a securities dealer, a new standard that is meant to include crypto operations among businesses the agency regulates as broker-dealers ‚Äì potentially including decentralized finance (DeFi). And the commission has pursued a couple of ongoing efforts that could hit crypto hard: One proposed rule expands the definition of ""exchange"" to encompass digital assets platforms in a way that also explicitly included DeFi, and another proposal would demand investment advisers only keep clients' crypto assets with ""qualified custodians,"" which the agency suggested leaves out the big crypto houses such as Coinbase. However, that custody rule is heading back to the drawing board, SEC officials have said.  If Gensler and his colleagues pull the trigger on the exchange rule before he leaves, the nearness of the next congressional session in 2025 would give lawmakers an opportunity ‚Äì as long as both chambers wanted to use it ‚Äì to reverse anything the agency approves. That power is under the Congressional Review Act and is the same authority lawmakers in Congress tapped to try to erase the agency's crypto accounting rule, which drove President Biden to step in with a veto to stop them.  Trump's first administration embraced the CRA power as it had never been used before, but it tends to require a Congress that's friendly to the president.  Legal strategy  Meanwhile, for whichever candidate shows up in the White House in January, there will almost certainly be a lengthy transition period. Rulemaking and enforcement cases are time-consuming endeavors, and an overhauled SEC inherits a great deal of work already mostly finished before new commissioners arrive. An incoming chair ‚Äì and potentially new top legal officials, such as the general counsel and the enforcement director ‚Äì would have a lot of triaging and decision-making to do on a herculean heap of court cases.  Some of the foundational crypto cases, such as those targeting Ripple and Coinbase, could be elevated in the coming year through appeals as they potentially wind their way toward the Supreme Court, where Gensler's legacy may truly be decided. New management would have to work out how they want to proceed with those.  Even if the agency is beat back by court losses or new laws from Congress that restrict its jurisdiction, the SEC will always have a major role in the U.S. crypto sector. Kelleher said that role will inevitably clash with the industry, because the regulator's first job is to protect investors, not businesses.  And he cautioned the crypto world from seeing Gensler as a villainous Wizard of Oz behind everything it doesn't like, because Kelleher contended that the commission chair has actually done more for the industry than anybody in government.

42422033,lZj3zXFJWcbTdP3qeivrH0,1729596480,ANZ to Kickstart Chainlink Private Transactions Protocol in RWA Boost,"Chainlink has introduced a new protocol aimed at ensuring privacy for financial institutions, enabling them to conduct secure, confidential transactions across different blockchain networks.  Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) will pilot this privacy feature for settling tokenized real-world assets, as part of Singapore's Project Guardian, highlighting a practical application of Chainlink's technology in the banking sector.  Chainlink released its CCIP Private Transactions protocol, a privacy-preserving tool, on Tuesday. The tool will allow financial institutions to maintain confidentiality and regulatory compliance when transacting across blockchain networks.  Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) will be among the first financial institutions to pilot the capability for cross-chain settlement of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) under the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) Project Guardian initiative.  Cross-chain protocols allow token holders to transfer and interact with applications among different blockchains, which is otherwise not possible. RWAs refer to a tokenized version of a physical asset, such as artwork or real estate, that is tradeable on the open market.  Institutional requirements include the need for complete end-to-end privacy for private chain to private chain transactions and limiting data exposure for private chain to public chain transactions.  The private transactions allow institutional users to define privacy conditions in a way that keeps onchain data private from all third parties and adversaries, while enabling authorized parties in the transaction or the compliance industry to view that same data.  ""Privacy is a critical requirement for most institutional transactions,"" said Sergey Nazarov, Chainlink co-founder, in a prepared statement. ""So far the blockchain industry has not provided the level of privacy necessary for these institutional transactions to move forward successfully, limiting the entire industry's growth.  ‚ÄúNow that private transactions across chains are possible, we expect an even greater influx of institutional adoption of blockchains, CCIP, and the Chainlink standard in general,‚Äù Nazarov added.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | LINK | TECHNOLOGY,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/10/22/anz-to-kickstart-chainlink-private-transactions-protocol-in-rwa-boost,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5f94bbfeb414eb1da61c638dd100a558434f5318-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422048,lZj3zXFJWcbTdP3qeivrje,1729596039,Bitcoin‚Äôs $4.2B October Options Expiry May Increase Short-Term Volatility,"October's expiry is due Friday at 08:00 UTC, with $4.2 billion in options expiry for bitcoin and over $1 billion for ether.  Bitcoin has a higher put/call ratio than ether, which indicates a more bullish sentiment as we approach options expiry.  The crypto market may be set up for some short-term volatility this week as monthly bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}} options contracts are set to expire on Friday.  BTC and ETH options contracts worth $4.2 billion and $1 billion, respectively, will expire on Deribit at 08:00 UTC. An option allows the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specified price within a certain time period.  According to Deribit data, what‚Äôs worth noting is that BTC options worth over $682 million, equating to 16.3% of the tally of $4.2 billion are set to expire ‚Äúin-the-money,‚Äù of which most are calls. A call with strike price below the going market rate is said to be ITM while ITM puts are those with strikes above the spot price.  The dynamic could breed market volatility as holders of in-profit ITM options look to close their bets or move positions in the next expiry. The last quarterly expiry dated end of September had a similar distribution of open interest.  Deribit data shows that the bitcoin put-to-call open interest ratio stands at 0.62 ahead of the expiry, indicating a relatively bullish sentiment. In other words, for every 100 call options active, 62 put options are open. The bias for calls is not surprising, considering BTC recently neared $70,000 for the first time since July.  Max pain at $64K  BTC‚Äôs max pain level is $64,000, where most options - would - expire worthless, causing the most loss to option buyers and maximizing profit for the options writers.  At press time, BTC traded near $67,000, well above the max pain level while ether changed hands at around the max pain level of $2,600. So believers of the max pain theory might say bitcoin has room to fall ahead of the expiry while ether‚Äôs downside is capped.  Max pain theory states that the pre-expiry activities of traders with short options exposure often drives the underlying asset closer to its max pain level. However, the crypto community is divided on the max pain effect, with some saying the options market is still quite small to impact the spot price.  The options market will continue to grow  Crypto options market has grown multi-fold in the past four years, with contracts worth billions of dollars expiring every month and quarter. That said, its still relatively small compared to the spot market. According to Glassnode, as of Friday's data, the spot volume was approximately $8.2 billion, while options volume was roughly $1.8 billion. In addition, BTC's open interest of $4.2 billion due to expire this Friday is less than 1% of BTC's market cap of $1.36 trillion.  That said, it could get bigger and move beyond BTC and into crypto-linked products in future as more institutions participate in the market. On Friday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved options tied to spot bitcoin ETFs. This comes after the approval of trading options of BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT).  Jeff Park, head of alpha strategies at Bitwise Invest, called the approval ""game-changing"" and believes exchanges with central guarantors, which LedgerX and Deribit don't provide, are necessary. Park goes on further to say that he believes the options will start available to start trading in Q1 2025.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,James Van Straten,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/22/bitcoins-42b-october-options-expiry-may-increase-short-term-volatility,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2a00ba8e6b826a24f2814d2d2bb2f054d95d68f9-2400x1200.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

35004565,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24359,1729593188,What is Scroll (SCR)?,"Scroll is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that leverages Zero Knowledge (ZK) proof technology , combined with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility. The project aims to enhance Ethereum‚Äôs scalability while maintaining the same developer-friendly environment that Ethereum provides. By using ZK proofs, Scroll ensures that transactions executed off-chain are verified on-chain with minimal computational overhead, significantly reducing fees and increasing throughput. Its EVM compatibility allows existing Ethereum applications to migrate onto Scroll without requiring significant changes to the codebase, preserving Ethereum‚Äôs robust ecosystem while optimising performance. One of Scroll‚Äôs standout features is its use of zero-knowledge cryptography to validate transaction data. This technology enables the platform to scale without sacrificing security, as every transaction executed on Scroll is accompanied by cryptographic proofs that are validated on Ethereum. This ensures that Scroll maintains Ethereum‚Äôs decentralisation and trust-minimisation principles. Scroll publishes its transaction data to Ethereum‚Äôs mainnet, with Ethereum smart contracts ensuring the integrity and correctness of all operations through zkEVM validity proofs, which further enhances security. Scroll also follows an open-source, community-driven development approach. By collaborating with Ethereum developers and researchers, Scroll aims to align with Ethereum‚Äôs long-term roadmap, focusing on decentralising the network while continuously improving scalability and security. This ethos ensures that Scroll evolves in tandem with Ethereum, integrating new innovations and feedback from a broad spectrum of contributors within the Ethereum community. As a result, the platform remains transparent and flexible in addressing the challenges of scaling Ethereum. Despite its focus on scalability and cost reduction, Scroll remains highly secure, conducting rigorous audits and leveraging its zkEVM and open-source nature to prevent vulnerabilities. This combination of security, scalability, and compatibility positions Scroll as a powerful Layer 2 solution for Ethereum, capable of scaling the network while preserving its foundational qualities. Its seamless integration with Ethereum‚Äôs ecosystem and continued focus on security and decentralisation ensure its relevance in the evolving landscape of blockchain technology. Get Started What is the SCR Token? The Scroll SCR token plays a crucial role within the Scroll ecosystem, acting as the native utility token for the Layer 2 network. One of its primary functions is to pay for transaction fees on the Scroll network, where users executing transactions or deploying smart contracts need to use SCR to cover gas costs. Since Scroll is designed to provide a more cost-effective and scalable environment compared to Ethereum‚Äôs mainnet, the SCR token helps facilitate lower transaction fees while maintaining the same security guarantees through zero-knowledge proofs. In addition to being used for transaction fees, SCR also functions as an incentive mechanism within the Scroll ecosystem. Validators and network participants responsible for maintaining the security and operability of the Scroll network are rewarded in SCR for their contributions. This helps incentivise the decentralised operation of the Scroll Layer 2, as validators verify transactions and generate the necessary zero-knowledge proofs to ensure that all off-chain activities align with Ethereum‚Äôs rules. These rewards ensure that the network remains efficient, secure, and aligned with Ethereum‚Äôs decentralised foundation. The SCR token also has governance functionalities built into the ecosystem. Token holders can participate in decision-making processes regarding network upgrades, protocol changes, and other governance matters that affect the Scroll ecosystem. This decentralised governance model enables the community to have a direct say in the future of the platform, aligning with Ethereum‚Äôs broader principle of open-source, community-driven development. By holding SCR, users have a stake in the evolution of Scroll, creating a system where those who are invested in its success can actively contribute to its growth and direction. SCR plays a key role in the network‚Äôs future plans for decentralisation. As Scroll matures, the SCR token is expected to facilitate staking mechanisms, where validators will need to stake SCR to participate in network consensus. This staking process will ensure that validators are financially incentivised to act in the network‚Äôs best interest, as malicious behaviour could result in the loss of staked SCR. This creates a robust economic security model, combining the scalability benefits of Layer 2 with the strong decentralisation and security principles that Ethereum is known for. Trade SCR Now SCR Tokenomics A significant aspect of the SCR tokenomics is the airdrop, designed to distribute tokens to early adopters and participants in the Scroll ecosystem. The airdrop will reward users who have interacted with the Scroll mainnet, participated in testnet activities, or contributed to the broader community. This approach not only rewards active users but also fosters a sense of inclusivity, helping to build a strong and engaged community that can contribute to the platform‚Äôs growth. The airdrop distribution will also help decentralise the initial token supply. The potential SCR token airdrop highlights the project‚Äôs commitment to community building and user acquisition. By rewarding early participants and contributors, Scroll ensures a broad distribution of tokens, which can help in avoiding centralisation risks. While specific details of the token distribution and airdrop eligibility remain to be confirmed, the strategy aims to solidify Scroll‚Äôs position in the Ethereum scaling space, engaging its community and ensuring broad participation as it grows.

42422031,lZj3zXFJWcbTdP3qeivrDQ,1729593176,"As Japan Election Looms, Political Parties Emphasize Need to Reform Crypto Tax Regulations","Political parties in Japan are pushing for further reforms to crypto tax regulation.  The national elections will take place on Oct 27.  Yuichiro Tamaki, leader of Japan‚Äôs Democratic Party for the People, is making an effort to woo voters by ‚Äúproposing clear tax cuts and regulatory reforms regarding cryptocurrencies‚Äù ahead of national elections on Oct 27.  ‚ÄúIf you think crypto assets should be taxed separately at 20% instead of treated as miscellaneous income, vote for the Democratic Party for the People. There will be no tax when exchanging crypto assets with other crypto assets,‚Äù he posted on X on Oct 20.  The DPFP - the sixth largest in the Diet‚Äôs House of Representatives, the lower house of Japan‚Äôs bicameral legislature, with seven seats - is also pushing for the launch of crypto exchange-traded funds and the conversion of the yen into an electronic currency, as well as the issuance of ‚Äúdigital regional currencies‚Äù by local governments to revitalize local economies.  The crypto tax regime in the country has long faced criticism from investors. Under the current system, crypto profits are taxed as income, meaning high earners can be taxed as high as 45% if their income is over 40,000,000 yen ($265,000). Meanwhile, capital gains from sales of securities such as shares face a flat rate of 20%.  But Tamaki isn‚Äôt the only politician advocating for changes in this policy. Crypto tax policies have been under review in Japan for the last two years. Last year, the country announced crypto holders would no longer face taxes on unrealized gains, while a policy document released by the Financial Services Agency in September recommended considering whether crypto assets should be treated as financial assets.  The Sunday general election comes as Shigeru Ishiba, the Liberal Democratic Party leader who became prime minister in September, seeks to solidify his position following a party campaign funding scandal. His predecessor, Fumio Kishida, was a strong advocate for web3, referring to it as a ‚Äúnew form of capitalism‚Äù.  In April, the Liberal Democratic Party released a white paper on its own approach to web3 and blockchain. Its then-web3 project team head, Masaaki Taira - who became Minister for Digital Transformation at the start of October - has also called for reforming the tax system for cryptocurrencies and the promotion of web3 and blockchain. He has also pointed out that Japan had an opportunity for growth through its gaming industry and the development of web3 games.  The country‚Äôs second largest party, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan said it too would review the crypto tax system, which it sees as closely related to the development of web3 in the country. It wants to establish a legal framework for DAOs to clarify their status and the obligations of members and participants.  The party would also consider the use of CBDCs, including ongoing pilot projects such as that of the Bank of Japan, as a means of diversifying payment methods and reducing costs.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Callan Quinn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/10/22/as-japan-election-looms-political-parties-emphasize-need-to-reform-crypto-tax-regulations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/02ce7b691cfdb4df2ee5d80e39200097510c745d-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

35003607,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649110,1729593057,Bitcoin Signal That Led To At Least 70% Surge Has Formed Again,"On-chain data shows a Bitcoin signal that has led to at least a 70% rally the last four times has recently formed for the asset once again. Bitcoin MVRV Momentum Has Seen A Bullish Crossover Recently In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed the recent trend in the Bitcoin Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio. The ‚ÄúMVRV Ratio‚Äù is an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the Bitcoin market cap and the realized cap. The realized cap here refers to an on-chain capitalization model that calculates the total value of the asset by assuming that the true value of any token in circulation is the price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain and not the current spot price. This last transaction price of any coin is likely to be its latest cost basis, so the realized cap is essentially a sum of the cost basis of all tokens in circulation. Put another way, this model represents the capital the investors have put into the asset. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Watch Out: Miners Showing Unusual Exchange Inflow Activity In contrast, the market cap, which calculates the total valuation of the total BTC supply at the current spot price, signifies the value the investors hold right now. When the value of the MVRV Ratio is greater than 1, the investors hold more value than they put in, so they are in a state of net profit. On the other hand, the metric under this threshold suggests the market as a whole is carrying a loss. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin MVRV Ratio and its 180-day moving average (MA) over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin MVRV Ratio has seen a surge recently as the asset‚Äôs price has gone through its recovery run, implying investor profitability has improved. With this increase, the indicator has now broken above its 180-day MA. Historically, a surge beyond this line has meant that the momentum of the metric has flipped to positive, which has proven to be a bullish predictor for the price. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Away With 9% Surge: Why This Could Trouble Bitcoin In the chart, the analyst highlighted the previous rallies that followed a momentum flip in the MVRV Ratio. BTC appeared to have seen surges of at least 70% on each of the last four occasions. Going by this precedent, the latest change in the MVRV Ratio momentum to green may again lead to a surge for Bitcoin. It only remains to be seen, though, whether any such rally would be of a comparable scale to the previous ones or not. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $67,500, up almost 3% over the last week.

Bernstein said stablecoins are now the cheapest method of cross-border payments.  The broker noted that this is the largest crypto acquisition by a major payments company.  Stripe's acquisition of Bridge validates the usage of stablecoins for public blockchains, broker Bernstein said in a research report Tuesday.  ""With improvements in blockchain scalability, stablecoins have emerged as the leading use case for blockchains, particularly for cross-border payments,"" analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote.  U.S. dollar denominated stablecoins on crypto rails are now the cheapest method of cross-border payments, at a cost of only 1-2 basis points, the report said.  Payments processor Stripe finalized a deal to buy stablecoin platform Bridge for $1.1 billion, according to an X post from TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington on Sunday, later confirmed by both companies.  Bernstein noted that the Bridge deal is the largest crypto acquisition by a major payments company to date.  Companies such as Bridge ""play an important role by building API software for businesses to integrate stablecoin payments within their regular payments experience,"" the authors wrote.  This deal highlights the ""growing recognition of stablecoin-based payments and their compelling benefits,"" investment bank Architect Partners said in a report Monday, noting that these coins are increasingly being used by non-crypto firms.  It's hard to see a more disruptive challenge to the TradFi banking system, ""payments at scale without the involvement of a bank,"" the report added.

35000552,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649138,1729587621,Bitcoin Retail Activity Soars After 4-Month Slump‚ÄîWould A 72% Rally Follow?,"Bitcoin has recently seen an uptick in retail investor activity following months of subdued participation, according to a report by CryptoQuant analyst caueconomy. The analyst highlighted this in a post on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, disclosing how this return in retail demand could be one of the signs of a bull market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Watch Out: Miners Showing Unusual Exchange Inflow Activity Bitcoin Retail Activity Returns After 4-Month Decline The CryptoQuant analyst noted that on-chain transaction volumes of up to $10,000‚Äîa key indicator of retail investment‚Äîhave increased by approximately 13% in the past 30 days. This marks a shift after four months, during which smaller investors were largely inactive. caueconomy wrote: Note that in the last 4 months we have seen a decrease in the activity of these small investors, while whales maintained a high amount of transactions and absorption of coins. The analyst further explained that the increase in small investor activity is typically more sensitive to market sentiment and news than fundamental factors. Additionally, it provides an early indicator of capital flows into the Bitcoin network. As mentioned by caueconomy, this rise in retail demand, which hasn‚Äôt been observed since March, could signal the beginning of a trend toward ‚Äúlower risk aversion‚Äù among non-institutional market participants. Notably, this increase in small investor activity comes at a time when Bitcoin‚Äôs price has seen constant increase in the past week, with the cryptocurrency recently attempting to reclaim the $70,000 mark. An Outlook On BTC‚Äôs Price‚Äî72% Rally Next? While retail demand appears to be returning, Bitcoin faces a minor retracement after its recent attempt to break the $70,000 price mark earlier today. The crypto asset reached a high of $69,431 earlier today but has since fallen by 2.4% in the past 24 hours, bringing the current price down to $66,951. Despite this slight dip, market sentiment among analysts remains optimistic about Bitcoin‚Äôs future potential. One notable analyst, Javon Marks, recently took to X to express his bullish outlook for Bitcoin. Marks highlighted a potential 72% price increase that could push Bitcoin to $116,000 or higher. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales ‚ÄòGrew Substantially‚Äô During Last Dip, Data Shows Large-Holder Accumulation According to his analysis, Bitcoin has been working around a key price level of $67,559.

New Staking Rules For VanEck‚Äôs Solana ETN Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, revealed that the Solana ETN, which trades under the ticker VSOL and currently has $73m in assets under management, will have rewards accrued and reinvested daily under the new staking rules, with the ultimate aim of attracting more investors and new capital. On the other hand, VanEck‚Äôs press release outlined how the staking process works for the Solana ETN. Importantly, the staking methods are designed to be non-custodial, meaning that the custodian of the ETN‚Äôs assets retains full control of the staked SOL, thereby eliminating lending risks typically associated with crypto investments. Related Reading: 7 Reasons To Be Bullish On Bitcoin This Week In addition, investors in the Solana ETN will not need to take any action to receive staking rewards. These rewards will be accounted for in the coin entitlement of the ETN, ensuring equitable distribution regardless of when the investment was made, minus a 25% staking fee. The staking rewards will be reflected in the daily end-of-day net asset value (NAV), with a cutoff point at 4 PM CET, allowing investors to benefit from staking without the ‚Äúcomplexities‚Äù usually involved in managing crypto assets directly. The firm also instructs its custodian to delegate SOL to a validator node owned and maintained by a staking provider. Importantly, control of the delegated SOL remains with the custodian, ensuring security and stability. Once the SOL is delegated, the validator node earns various rewards, including inflationary and block rewards, accrued continuously. These rewards will be reinvested into the ETN daily, contributing to its overall performance. SOL Price Prediction The fifth-largest cryptocurrency, has shown significant price action over the past month, gaining approximately 10% and currently trading at $164.50. This recovery follows a significant drop to around $109 on August 5, signaling a strong rebound amidst a generally bullish market sentiment. Market expert Carl Runefelt recently highlighted Solana‚Äôs potential for further gains in a Monday social media post, stating that the token could ‚Äúgo parabolic starting today.‚Äù Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Watch Out: Miners Showing Unusual Exchange Inflow Activity Runefelt pointed out a significant technical pattern on the SOL/USDT daily chart, identifying a breakout from a ‚ÄúCup and Handle‚Äù formation. This bullish pattern often signifies a strong upward momentum, with Runefelt projecting a potential price target of $370. Achieving this target would mean Solana surpassing its all-time high of $259, set in November 2021. This bullish outlook aligns with other analysts‚Äô broader bullish predictions for the cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin, which is also expected to hit new highs in the coming months.

Some market watchers forecasted a 345% surge before the year‚Äôs end but set the key levels to reclaim before FTM‚Äôs new all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: 7 Reasons To Be Bullish On Bitcoin This Week Fantom Breaks Out Of Downtrend As Sunday ended, Fantom‚Äôs price jumped 8.2% toward a crucial resistance level not seen in four months. The cryptocurrency neared the $0.8 mark for the second time in the last seven days, fueling a bullish sentiment among investors. FTM has registered a 46.6% increase in the past three months, recovering from Q3‚Äôs market crashes and challenging June‚Äôs price action. June‚Äôs horizontal resistance marks the first crucial level for the cryptocurrency, as it was a strong support area during Q1 and Q2. Moreover, Fantom has been on a 7-month downtrend since its yearly high of $0.97, currently sitting 23% below it. Market analyst AMCrypto suggested that the cryptocurrency‚Äôs downtrend ‚Äúis now over.‚Äù The analyst noted that the token broke above the trendline after surging above the $0.74 resistance level and testing it as support over the last week. However, he highlighted the similarities between FTM‚Äôs chart today and before Q1‚Äôs rally. Fantom rose two times to the upper range of its accumulation zone and retraced before its run toward its yearly high. To AMCrypto, FTM could see a final correction toward the $0.70-$0.72 range before rallying 35% toward ‚Äú$1 and above.‚Äù Similarly, crypto investor Rager commented on FTM‚Äôs chart strength. To the investor, the token ‚Äúgives the Solana 2023 pump-like vibes,‚Äù suggesting it will ‚Äúplay catch up for the major chains over the next three months.‚Äù FTM‚Äôs Price Targets $3 Analyst Altcoin Sherpa shared his thoughts on the token‚Äôs future performance. Sherpa considers that Fantom will continue ‚Äúto grind higher‚Äù if Bitcoin‚Äôs price remains stable. BTC‚Äôs movements have affected FTM‚Äôs price, losing support losing its support whenever the flagship crypto drops. However, Fantom has managed to hold above the recently reclaimed $0.74 mark as Bitcoin dropped 2.2% to the $67,000 support zone on Monday morning. The cryptocurrency must regain the $0.75 mark to continue building on its bullish momentum and reclaim the $0.8 resistance. Turning this level into support targets a potential rise above $3. Meanwhile, other market watchers suggested that FTM will hit a new ATH before its token migration. As reported by NewsBTC, Fantom is set to transition to the Sonic Network between November and December of this year. Related Reading: Long-Silent Bitcoin Whale Resurfaces After 10 Years As BTC Price Soars The transition will see FTM migrating to Sonic‚Äôs native token, S, offering a 1:1 conversion ratio for FTM holders. The new cryptocurrency will have a 3.175 billion token supply like Fantom but will mint an additional 190.5 million tokens, worth 6% of the supply, six months after its launch.

Some traders bought the call option at $2.2, representing bullish expectations.  APE ecosystem's governance and utility token APE has doubled in value to $1.50 since the weekend, leading the broader market higher.  Options activity on PowerTrade, a crypto exchange focused on derivatives tied to alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins), suggests that the recent strong bullish momentum is expected to persist in the short term.  Open interest, or the number of active APE options contracts, surged by over 800% to 263,000 ($394.5K) in one day, PowerTrade told CoinDesk Monday, adding that call options or derivatives, offering an asymmetric upside potential, account for over 80% of the tally. Call buyers are implicitly bullish on the underlying asset.  Most activity is concentrated on the Oct. 22 and Oct. 25 expiry contracts, with traders buying higher strike out-of-the-money (OTM) calls at strikes as high as $2.2 or nearly 50% higher than APE's going market price.  The activity in APE options is noteworthy, considering the token has a market capitalization of just $1 billion and represents growing sophistication in the altcoin space. That said, open interest and volume are way lower than the billions of dollars locked in BTC and ETH options contracts listed on the leading exchange Deribit.  The bullish expectations likely stem from the Apechain mainnet launch and LayerZero's integration.  PowerTrade offers European-styled USD-settled options with one contract representing 1 APE as underlying. The exchange debuted the request-for-quote (RFQ) model for the options market in late 2022, allowing the execution of multi-legged strategies as a single instrument.  On Monday, the platform registered a record trading volume of $50 million in options tied to 44 altcoins and plans to offer options tied to several other altcoins, including EIGEN, APT, ARK, and PYTH.",POSITIVE,APE,ALTCOIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | APE,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/22/ape-traders-make-bold-moves-in-powertrades-altcoin-options-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5572ef55fa279fecc63e28ede5dff6085a2ad209-2048x1151.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

34995330,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649170,1729576808,"Market Analyst Charts The Bitcoin Journey To $70,000: Weekly Price Action Insights","Since July 29, the Bitcoin price has been struggling to regain the $70,000 mark, which has proven to be a formidable resistance barrier for the leading cryptocurrency. This resistance has been in place for the last two quarters of the year, after BTC hit an all-time high of $73,700 back in March this year. Since then, the market has experienced price corrections and periods of consolidation, but recent bullish sentiment has sparked hope for a price resurgence as the year progresses. Could $70,000 Be Within Reach? Market analyst Rekt Capital has provided insights into Bitcoin‚Äôs current trajectory, emphasizing the recent uptrend and the potential for the cryptocurrency to regain the $70,000 mark. Notably, Rekt pointed out that Bitcoin has broken through a downtrending channel after surpassing the $65,000 level earlier this month, effectively invalidating a series of lower highs that had been established since mid-March. Related Reading: XRP Network Activity Surges As Price Seeks To Break $0.55 Resistance This breakout signifies the end of the previous downtrend. Rekt noted that Bitcoin had repeatedly failed to break above the channel‚Äôs resistance, but the most recent weekly close has shifted market sentiment. In his analysis, Rekt explains that Bitcoin is currently retesting its former resistance point above $69,000, suggesting that a successful retest could confirm the breakout and pave the way for further upside momentum. Rekt further explains that the current retest of lower support floors could see Bitcoin‚Äôs price dip to around $66,300, which is the channel top. This level has previously served as a significant barrier, preventing the price from reaching higher levels. Rekt pointed out that last week‚Äôs performance demonstrated the importance of this area, as Bitcoin closed above the lower high, setting the stage for a possible transition to higher levels if the aforementioned support holds. Key Resistance Challenge Ahead For Bitcoin If Bitcoin successfully retests this support level, the analyst expects that the next target would be the range high at approximately $71,500. This level marks a crucial challenge for Bitcoin, as it would signify the first attempt to breach the top of the re-accumulation range since June. Rekt goes on to argue that a successful move towards the area high above these levels would demonstrate that the previous resistance is weakening, further boosting BTC‚Äôs prospects of reaching higher levels. However, the question remains: how deep will any potential retracement be if Bitcoin faces rejection at the range high? Historically, since mid-March 2024, Bitcoin has encountered deeper rejections, with declines of 21% to 25% on August 5 and September 6 respectively. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Prediction: Crypto Analyst Says Things Are ‚ÄòAbout To Get Interesting‚Äô Rekt concludes that BTC is moving deeper into a prior resistance area at $66,000, which may soon transform into support. A successful retest of this level could precede a significant reversal back to the $70,000 mark, reinforcing the bullish outlook for Bitcoin as it navigates through these critical price levels. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $67,350, registering a retracement of 2% in the 24-hour time frame.

The price is now holding the key $588 support and might aim for a fresh increase. BNB price started a downside correction from the $612 resistance zone. The price is now trading below $600 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $595 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair must stay above the $588 level to start another increase in the near term. BNB Price Could Regain Traction After a decent upward move, BNB price saw a rejection pattern nears the $612 zone. A high was formed at $611 and the price started a downside correction like Ethereum and Bitcoin. There was a move below the $605 and $600 levels. The price even dipped below $592 before the bulls appeared near $590. A low was formed at $591 and the price is now consolidating. It climbed above the $598 level and the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $611 swing high to the $591 low. The price is now trading below $600 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. If there is a fresh increase, the price could face resistance near the $602 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $611 swing high to the $591 low. The next resistance sits near the $610 level. A clear move above the $610 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $620. A close above the $620 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $632 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $650 level in the near term. More Losses? If BNB fails to clear the $605 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $592 level. The next major support is near the $588 level. The main support sits at $588. If there is a downside break below the $580 support, the price could drop toward the $575 support.

This decline was mirrored by other major cryptocurrencies like ETH, TON, and ADA, with over $165 million in long positions liquidated, indicating significant leverage use in the market.  Meanwhile, market analysts predict a rangebound week for cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, with key resistance levels not yet surpassed.

The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index tracking the largest tokens by market capitalization, lost 2.1%.  Over $165 million in longs -- or bets on higher prices -- were liquidated across crypto futures tracking major tokens in a sign of a leverage flush. As CoinDesk reported Monday, the use of leverage spiked over the weekend in a move that historically precedes market volatility.  Elsewhere, Simon‚Äôs Cat (CAT) token jumped 63% to lead market gains after a futures listing on influential exchange Binance.

The price is now trading below $0.5500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $0.5500 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $0.5550 and $0.5580 resistance levels. XRP Price Trades In A Range XRP price remained stable above the $0.5320 support zone. It started a decent increase above the $0.550 level, but the bears were active near the $0.5600 resistance zone. A high was formed at $0.5600 before the price started to decline like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a decline below the $0.5550 and $0.550 levels. Besides, there was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $0.5500 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.5375 swing low to the $0.5600 high. The price is now trading below $0.5460 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The bulls are now protecting the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.5375 swing low to the $0.5600 high. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.5460 level. The first major resistance is near the $0.5500 level. The next key resistance could be $0.5550. A clear move above the $0.5550 resistance might send the price toward the $0.5600 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.5800 resistance or even $0.5880 in the near term. The next major hurdle might be $0.6000. Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $0.5500 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5420 level. The next major support is near the $0.5365 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5365 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $0.5320 support in the near term. The next major support sits near the $0.5250 zone.

34992718,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649121,1729571428,Ethereum Accumulation Rises As 70% Holders Are In Profit: What It Means For ETH Price?,"According to an analysis from on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant, the total Ethereum (ETH) amount in accumulation wallets has surged to over 19 million. Ethereum Accumulation Continues To Surge The analysis shared by verified CryptoQuant analyst, Burak Kesmeci, indicates that more than 19 million ETH is now held by the so-called ‚Äúaccumulation addresses.‚Äù In January 2024, these addresses held about 11.5 million ETH. Related Reading: Survey Finds Almost 70% Of Ethereum Institutional Investors Engaged In ETH Staking The rapid increase in ETH held by accumulation addresses suggests that sophisticated investors may anticipate a rally in the digital assets market toward the end of the year. Kesmeci highlighted that the amount of ETH held in these addresses has almost doubled and might rise above 20 million ETH by year end. Several factors contribute to this high level of ETH accumulation. First, the approval of Ethereum-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) earlier this year by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave the much-sought regulatory clarity and approval to the second-largest cryptocurrency by reported market cap. The analyst explains: Regulations boosted confidence, making Ethereum mainstream. It‚Äôs no longer just for tech enthusiasts ‚Äì institutions and individuals see it as a key part of the financial future. I expect these addresses to hold over 20 million ETH by the end of the year. With Ethereum priced around $4,000, the total value will surpass $80 billion, making these accumulation addresses as valuable as some of the world‚Äôs largest companies. As of October 18, 2024, US-based ETH spot ETFs hold total net assets worth $7.35 billion, representing almost 2.3% of Ethereum‚Äôs market cap. In the last week, ETH spot ETFs attracted $78.9 million in net inflows after two consecutive weeks of net outflows. 70% Of ETH Holders In Profit Data from IntoTheBlock shows that 70% of ETH holders are in profit, while 28% are in loss and 2% are at breakeven. Further, 74% of current ETH holders have held the digital asset for over a year, while 23% have held it for over a month but less than a year. These factors indicate that investors are not eager to part with their ETH holdings anytime soon. A majority of profitable holders may lead to increased buying pressure, potentially driving ETH prices higher. However, many holders realizing profits could also result in selling pressure, creating volatility. Related Reading: Ethereum Derivative Market Sees Over 50,000 ETH Inflow ‚Äì Price Fall Imminent? The case for heightened ETH volatility is strengthened by the recent sharp rise in open interest for the digital asset. Some crypto analysts are confident that ETH will re-test some of its crucial resistance levels before further upside movement. For instance, crypto analyst Carl Runefelt recently opined that if ETH breaks the $2,640 resistance level, it could initiate a significant price rally. ETH trades at $2,663 at press time, down 2.4% in the past 24 hours.

Ethereum price is now trading below $2,680 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,665 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,700 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,757 swing high to the $2,626 low.

This breakout signals a confirmed uptrend, sparking excitement among investors as Solana continues to push higher. With the market showing renewed optimism, analysts set bullish price targets for Solana‚Äôs next potential moves. Related Reading: Ethereum Upside Target Around $2,800 As Price Tests Key Resistance Top analyst and investor Carl Runefelt recently shared valuable insights on Solana‚Äôs outlook, boldly predicting that Solana could reach $370 in the coming months. He believes that the altcoin is set for a significant rally once Solana breaks above its current high timeframe bullish pattern. Investors are closely watching for confirmation of this bullish trend, anticipating further gains as Solana‚Äôs price action gains momentum. Solana‚Äôs recent breakout and positive market sentiment suggest a strong performance shortly. Solana Prepares For A Rally Solana is on the verge of a move, potentially reaching yearly or even all-time highs. The bullish outlook across the market continues to signal positive gains for SOL in the coming months. Crypto analyst Carl Runefelt recently shared a technical analysis on X, stating that Solana could go parabolic starting today. He highlights that SOL is breaking out of a massive Cup & Handle pattern, a classic bullish formation often seen on higher timeframes. Solana could rally toward a potential target of $370 if this pattern plays out. The Cup & Handle pattern is known for its reliability in signaling strong price movements, particularly when the handle completes and breaks upward. In Solana‚Äôs case, this breakout could lead to substantial gains, pushing the price to new highs. As the crypto market continues with momentum, SOL investors are optimistic about the potential price surge in the coming days. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Above $0.12 Level ‚Äì Time For DOGE To Catch Up? With the bullish sentiment surrounding Solana, the next few weeks could be crucial in determining whether SOL can maintain its trajectory toward new highs. Investors may see significant returns if Solana breaks out and benefits from the market‚Äôs bullish sentiment. SOL Testing Supply Solana trades at $166 after successfully breaking above the key $160 resistance level. However, it faced rejection at the $171 supply zone. This level previously acted as minor support in late July and is now a resistance. If SOL manages to break above this resistance, the next target would be a higher supply level (around $188), where investors are likely to take profits or reposition. While the recent price action suggests strength, a healthy retrace to test the previous $160 resistance as support wouldn‚Äôt surprise investors. Such a pullback could provide a stronger foundation for SOL‚Äôs continued bullish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaking Out Of 7-Month Accumulation Channel: Expert Predicts Further Upside The overall market sentiment remains optimistic, with many cryptocurrencies experiencing upward movement, which could further fuel Solana‚Äôs price action. If SOL holds above $160, it could confirm the next rally, positioning Solana for a surge in the coming weeks. Breaking through the $171 resistance will be critical in determining whether SOL can maintain its bullish trajectory.

34987650,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649119,1729560614,Crypto Investment Products See Record $2.2 Billion Inflows‚ÄîIs The Bull Run Here?,"The latest weekly digital asset fund flow report from CoinShares has revealed that last week, crypto asset investment products saw roughly $2.2 billion in net inflows globally, marking the largest inflow since July. This rise in inflows comes amid the gradual recovery of top crypto assets last week, with the majority now reclaiming major highs and registering nearly double-digit gains over the past 7 days. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Price Reach A New All-Time High? This Golden Cross Suggests So Who Led the Charge? Bitcoin-based products were the standout beneficiaries of last week‚Äôs inflows. US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) added $2.1 billion, with BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT ETF alone generating over $1.1 billion. The cumulative inflows for these Bitcoin ETFs, which began trading in January, now stand at $21 billion. These funds have grown to manage a record $66 billion in assets under management, highlighting their significant role in the market. Notably, the renewed confidence in Bitcoin products mirrors earlier this year‚Äôs positive sentiment. Last week‚Äôs inflows were the largest since March, when US spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $2.6 billion as Bitcoin reached its all-time high above the $73,000 price mark. This strong demand suggests that investors remain bullish on Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term prospects, despite recent market fluctuations. While Bitcoin stole the spotlight, other cryptocurrencies also experienced inflows last week although way lesser than that of BTC. Ethereum-based products attracted $58 million in net inflows, while Solana, Litecoin, and XRP-based funds saw smaller inflows of $2.4 million, $1.7 million, and $700,000, respectively. However, multi-asset investment products did not fare well, experiencing net outflows of $5.3 million, ending a 17-week streak of consecutive inflows. What Prompted The Surge In Crypto Inflow? According to CoinShares, this surge in inflows is tied to growing optimism about the upcoming US elections, with a potential Republican victory driving investor sentiment. Many believe that a Republican administration would favor the digital asset market more favorably, leading to an increase in investor confidence and positive price momentum. James Butterfill, Head of Research at CoinShares, particularly noted: We believe this renewed optimism stems from growing expectations of a Republican victory in the upcoming US elections, as they are generally viewed as more supportive of digital assets. Notably, Butterfill, reiterated these views, adding that trading volume for these investment products surged by 30% last week. Total assets under management (AUM) for crypto funds are now nearing the $100 billion mark on a global scale, highlighting the substantial interest in digital assets.

Why Muted Volume Could Trigger Major Crash","Alan Santana, a crypto analyst on TradingView, has predicted that the Bitcoin price could potentially experience a drastic decline to new lows around $35,720, driven by muted buying volume. The analyst has declared that the current state of the market is bearish, highlighting potential manipulation from whale investors. Bitcoin Price Could Crash To $35,720 According to Santana, Bitcoin has witnessed 75 days of bullish activity but has not reached projected new price peaks, currently trading within a lower high below $70,000. While the cryptocurrency did hit an All-Time High (ATH) in March, surging past $73,000, Santana has concluded that the general market has become relatively bearish. Related Reading: Dogecoin Flashes Sell Signal After 30% Rally ‚Äì Time To Sell? He disclosed that most of the Bitcoin price action between August 5 and to present day is forming part of an inverted correction, which suggests that prices have been rising but without reaching new peaks. Santana also declared that the current Bitcoin price action confirms that there is no bullish momentum. He attributed this lack of momentum to muted whale activities, highlighting that there are currently no buyers or buying volume at the current market level. Due to these bearish conditions, Santana has predicted that Bitcoin could end up crashing to $35,720, representing a massive 46.68% decrease to new lows. This also means that Bitcoin‚Äôs price will drop by almost half, triggering panic and fear amongst retail and whale investors. Contrary to Santana‚Äôs bearish analysis, the price of Bitcoin is up by 5.56% and trading at $68,203, according to CoinMarketCap. The cryptocurrency is gradually increasing to reach the $70,000 mark, driven by positive changes in market sentiment and the historically bullish Q4. Although Santana has stayed firm in his bearish predictions of Bitcoin due to limited buying power, the analyst has also received severe backlash from various crypto community members. One member criticized Santana‚Äôs bearish Bitcoin prediction, suggesting that there were flaws in his analysis. Others accused the analyst of attempting to manipulate investors by using a Bitcoin chart from a Blofin exchange, which typically has lower transaction activity. Bitcoin Market Manipulation And Bears Despite the heat from crypto members, Santana believes that market manipulation has led to the current bearish price action in Bitcoin. The analyst highlights that Bitcoin‚Äôs price can be artificially manipulated by large holders or so-called Whales. Related Reading: FLOKI Breaks Out Of Downtrend: Analyst Predicts 200% Rally To New All-Time High He stated that these whales can push the price of Bitcoin up hoping that retail investors will dive into the market and buy, ultimately triggering a bullish wave. According to Santana, if there are no genuine Bitcoin buyers, the alleged manipulation could backfire, possibly leading to losses for said market manipulators. Santana has revealed that retail investors are no longer easily fooled into buying Bitcoin at the top, showing more caution due to previous cycles of manipulation and hype. He also disclosed that buyers are not swayed by exaggerated predictions of substantial future gains by analysts, claiming that Bitcoin could reach $3,000,000.
