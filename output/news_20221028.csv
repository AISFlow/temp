42415130,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBXWLo,1666999428,Crypto Lobbyist Group Blockchain Association Asks Court for Permission to Support Ripple Against SEC Case,"The Blockchain Association, a crypto lobbying organization based in Washington, D.C., filed for permission to support Ripple as a friend of the court in its ongoing defense against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) late Friday.  The SEC sued Ripple at the end of 2020 on allegations that it sold XRP as an unregistered security. The case has gone through a number of procedural motions since, and the parties recently filed their motions for summary judgement. On Friday, the Blockchain Association asked the court overseeing the case for permission to join the case, as well as the actual ""amicus"" brief.  ""The SEC’s extremely broad interpretation of the securities laws would have devastating effects on the industry (and even outside the industry),"" the motion for leave said.  A memorandum of law in support of the motion for leave said its actual brief points out different uses of crypto tokens within the industry, rather than just Ripple itself.  Read more: SEC, Ripple Call for Immediate Ruling in Suit Over Whether XRP Sales Violated Securities Laws  The brief itself says the court should look at a token's specific purpose, and argues the SEC ""unlawfully"" looked at secondary sales as proof that the company was violating federal securities laws.  The filing went on to say that many tokens are used in secondary market transactions, and they do not meet the different tenets of the Howey Test, a U.S. Supreme Court case generally used as precedent in trying to interpret if an asset is a security.  Much of the brief focuses on the question of how broadly securities laws apply to tokens outside of initial sales.  ""The securities laws do not contemplate how an asset that may have been issued as a security can exist when it is no longer attached to any form of investment contract, a crucial consideration when attempting to apply Howey,"" the filing said.  Another group, the Investor Choice Advocates Network and SpendTheBits Inc., filed its own friend of the court brief on Friday, with the court's permission.  These entities argued that the SEC is using a ""vague"" definition of ""investment contract"" to bring its case, and pointed to ongoing legislative efforts to define where the SEC's jurisdiction over crypto begins and ends.

Bitcoin's hash rate hit a new all-time high of 257.7 Exahash per second, up 13.2% from the previous month. The sharp growth in the difficulty of mining is negatively reflected in the increase in the cost of Bitcoin mining, and thus the operating income of mining companies is reduced. An increase in the interest rate by the Fed leads to a decrease in appetite for high-risk assets, which include Bitcoin. The increase in the price of the most significant world indices, namely the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY ) and Nasdaq 100 (NASDAQ: QQQ ) by 5% this week contributed to the growth of investment interest in cryptocurrencies, which are still under pressure. The economic situation in the world continues to deteriorate due to rising inflation, which entails an increase in the cost of mining equipment. The economic growth of China, which is the second largest Bitcoin mining country , slightly accelerated in Q3 2022 but remains at multi-year lows. Moreover, youth unemployment remains high at 17.9%, and combined with lower house prices, these factors could exacerbate China's property crisis and put severe pressure on the economies of many Asian countries. As a result, this will lead to an accelerated decline in investment interest in high-risk assets, which include cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), and Ripple ( XRP-USD ). However, despite the problematic macroeconomic and geopolitical situation in the world, the price of Bitcoin remains stable and continues to consolidate in a narrow price range since September 2022. Source: N_Aisenstadt — TradingView In this article, we will analyze the reasons indicating that the price of Bitcoin has not yet reached the bottom and, as a result, in my opinion, shocks await for the crypto industry, including numerous funds, including the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( OTC:GBTC ) and ETFs. Competition among miners reaches multi-year highs Despite continued downward pressure on the prices of various cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin's hash rate reached a new all-time high of 257.7 Exahash per second, up 13.2% from the previous month. For those who are not familiar with cryptocurrencies, the hash rate shows the total processing power of the mining equipment that is used in the process of mining them. Source: Author's elaboration, based on Glassnode However, as the hash rate grows, the difficulty of mining, which shows how difficult it is to make a mathematical calculation to find a new block and, accordingly, receive a reward for it, also systematically increases. This indicator increased by 47.1% compared to the peak reached in May 2021 , during which the period was marked by a significant tightening of China’s policy regarding cryptocurrency trading and mining, which subsequently led to the emigration of the mining company to Kazakhstan and the United States. The sharp growth in mining difficulty over the past two weeks is negatively reflected in the increase in the cost of bitcoin mining, and thus there is a decrease in the cash flow of mining companies that are in dire need of it to purchase more powerful and economical mining equipment. As a result, this creates additional financial burdens on the cryptocurrency mining industry, and in the face of tightening central bank policies, it will be harder for company management to find funding for their activities. Source: Author's elaboration, based on Glassnode At the end of October 2022, revenue per Exahash hit a multi-year low of 3.44 BTC per Exahash per day, down 44.7% year-on-year. When converting this value from Bitcoin to dollars, the current situation is also deplorable for the industry, since the revenue for one Exahash is $67-72 thousand per day. This figure has already fallen below the levels seen at the beginning of Q4 2020 after the halving. Source: Author's elaboration, based on Glassnode One of the most important metrics for predicting the price of Bitcoin is Mining Pulse, which monitors the activity of miners and then compares the interval for mining a Bitcoin block against a target value of 10 minutes. If Bitcoin blocks appear slower than 10 minutes, then this may signal that the miners are leaving the network due to the onset of a shock event. As you can see in the chart below, after each multi-year high in the price of Bitcoin, there was a period of bearish sentiment that ended in a dramatic capitulation of the miners. According to my calculations, the next capitulation of miners with an increase in the block interval by 20% relative to the target value will occur at the end of 2022 and will seriously test the strength of publicly traded companies such as Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ: RIOT ), Hut 8 Mining (NASDAQ: HUT ), and HIVE Blockchain Technologies (NASDAQ: HIVE ). Source: Author's elaboration, based on Glassnode Bitcoin Price Prediction Based on Mining Parameters The system developed and described in Glassnode and allowing to estimate the cost of Bitcoin mining using such fundamental parameters as Difficulty and Issuance, it is possible to predict the most likely price ranges of ""digital gold"", reaching which the largest market participants will begin to pursue an aggressive policy of accumulating this asset. So, for example, the current estimated cost of Bitcoin mining, marked with a pink line in the chart below, is $12,200. When referring to historical data, in most of the crypto crashes, including those that led to the capitulation of miners, the price of Bitcoin exactly reached the minimum values ​​inferred by this model. Source: Author's elaboration, based on Glassnode The impact of the Fed interest rate on the price of cryptocurrencies The Federal Reserve continues to increase the interest rate in order to fight inflation, which is still at a high level. Rising interest rates typically reduce appetite for high-risk assets like Bitcoin, while financial stocks and short-term government bonds are in the golden age. As a consequence, this means an increased likelihood that the cryptocurrency industry will continue to experience downward pressure until at least the end of 2023. The reason for this is the latest Fed forecasts , which expect to raise the interest rate to the range of 4.25-4.50% by the end of 2022, and by 2023 it should be 4.50-4.75%, which will be the highest rate for the last 16 years. Source: Federal Reserve System The stock market continues to react negatively to Fed rate increases, including due to fears that the performance of companies that actively used loans during low-interest rates in 2020-2021, but now they have to issue senior bonds with a higher coupon rate and thereby increase the cost of servicing the debt. So, for example, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) stocks came under the most severe selling pressure this week due to a decrease in operating income in the 3rd quarter of 2022, both relative to the previous year and the previous quarter. Looking at the historical data, one can see evidence of a correlation between the Fed's interest rate and the price of Bitcoin. So, on January 5, 2022 , the FOMC published minutes that indicated the need to raise the rate. During the same day, the price of Bitcoin fell by more than $3,000, and five days later, the decline was about 16.3%. Source: N_Aisenstadt — TradingView Looking at the crypto crash of 2018, the price of Bitcoin continued to fall during the Fed rate hike. However, once the Fed paused policy tightening in early 2019, the downward pressure on the Bitcoin price ended, and the crypto market stabilized. And by the second quarter of 2019, the price of Bitcoin reached $12,000, thereby showing a 275% increase in just four months. Source: Author's elaboration, based on YCharts Technical Analysis of Bitcoin When predicting the price movement of Bitcoin, I use Elliott Wave Theory, as this method has proven itself and, when used correctly, it has a relatively low error, especially when analyzing cryptocurrencies. From November 8, 2021, a correctional wave (IV) began to form, in which wave Ⓦ was formed in the form of a zigzag (""A""-""B""-""C""), and at the moment an intervening wave ⓧ continues to form. When switching from the weekly timeframe to the 4-hour timeframe, you can see the formation of wave (Y) from October 17, 2022, which is included in the structure of the wave ⓧ. With a high degree of probability, it will take the form of a double zigzag, and as a result, I expect the price of Bitcoin to rise to $23,800-24,200. After that, the corrective movement of this asset will continue up to the range of $12,700-$13,600 per BTC, where the smart money will begin to accumulate ""digital gold"" in anticipation of the formation of the final global impulsive wave ""V"" and Bitcoin halving in 2024. Source: N_Aisenstadt — TradingView Conclusion Periods of low volatility are extremely rare for Bitcoin, and similar periods to the current situation could be observed both before the sharp collapse in the prices of cryptocurrencies in December 2018, and at the beginning of the epic rally in the first half of 2019. Despite the over 70% decline in the price of Bitcoin from multi-year highs and the slowdown in the global economy, the Bitcoin hash rate has risen markedly this week to another all-time high. On the one hand, this is a signal indicating an increase in interest in mining the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, but on the other hand, it reduces the margins of mining companies that are already experiencing difficulties with liquidity. From a fundamental point of view, the cryptocurrency market continues to correlate with the stock market. Thus, in the ongoing period of interest rate hikes by the Fed, there are no significant prerequisites that would indicate the imminent start of a Bitcoin bull run. In addition, the current period in which central banks are resorting to tightening policy leads to a decrease in appetite for high-risk assets, which include cryptocurrencies. In terms of technical analysis, I expect a slight upward movement in the price of Bitcoin to the area of $23,800-24,200. However, this will be followed by a 40% retracement to a strong support zone formed in the $12,700-$13,600 price range per BTC.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4550590-anticipating-crypto-crisis-bitcoin-price-might-drop-35-percent?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/3467901.jpeg

That selling started to become more aggressive in June. The company has also been selling machines to raise liquidity and has dealt with challenges from higher energy costs. Argo also has baby bond shares that are now priced at just 50 cents on the dollar, indicating the market is worried about Argo's ability to pay the dividend. Yesterday both the cryptocurrency community and the traditional equity investment world learned the leading Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miner by monthly production is facing insolvency . While each company has its own struggles, it's difficult not to look at what just happened with Core Scientific ( CORZ ) and wonder who is next. The majority of the macro headwinds that Core Scientific has been dealing with are challenges that every other Bitcoin miner is sharing. Specifically, with increases in the hashrate and difficulty for block rewards, the miners have been experiencing a nasty margin squeeze for most of 2022: Mining profitability (BitInfoCharts) Mining profitability hit an all-time low just a few days ago and in light of the CORZ news, it's reasonable to start wondering if there will be another casualty from the margin squeeze. Argo's Underperformance One of the publicly listed Bitcoin miners that I've been telling BlockChain Reaction subscribers to avoid for several weeks is Argo Blockchain ( ARBK ) ( ARBKL ). 1 Month Returns (Seeking Alpha) You can see in the chart above that Argo had already been the weakest performing publicly listed miner over the last month before yesterday when CORZ collapsed about 75%. This weakness was likely a response to Argo's announcement that it was selling 3,400 mining machines earlier this month. The asset liquidation being an attempt to raise $6.8 million in cash. From the company's PR : As previously reported on 9 September 2022, the Company has seen headwinds from the price of both natural gas and electricity caused by the geopolitical situation in Europe and low levels of natural gas storage in the United States. These factors, coupled with the decline in the price of Bitcoin since March 2022 and the increased mining difficulty, have reduced the Company's profitability and free cash flow generation. High energy prices have been plaguing many of the publicly traded miners but Argo stands out in a bad way because of its high debt load compared to other similarly sized mining operations. Balance Sheet Glancing at the balance sheet, it's easy to see why the company needs cash. There is a high debt burden compared to peers and not much left to pay the bills. CORZ BITF IREN CLSK BTBT ARBK Market Cap 360.87M 222.25M 198.21M 174.25M 92.37M 94.03M Enterprise Value 1.38B 296.03M 196.53M 190.94M 57.12M 219.94M Total Cash 128.54M 45.98M 109.97M 3.48M 44.30M 11.21M Total Debt 1.15B 123.64M 108.29M 20.16M 0 143.63M Net Debt 1.02B 77.65M -1.68M 16.68M -44.30M 132.42M Total Debt to Equity 275.77% 36.89% 24.76% 5.35% 1.71% 71.44% Source: Seeking Alpha Like Core Scientific, Argo Blockchain has a debt to equity position substantially higher than most peers. At the end of Q2, Argo had $53.4 million in short term borrowings, $15.3 million in accounts payable, $14.9 million in combined cash and receivables, and just $14.4 million in revenue in the quarter. Similarities to Core Scientific There were tea leaves to read leading up to Core's disclosure that it can't service its equipment obligations next month. A big indication that Core was in trouble was the aggressive treasury selloff from May to June. Core sold off roughly 75% of its BTC stack over that time period but the peak in the company's treasury actually happened in April. We can see some similarities in Argo. I've added fellow Bitcoin miner Riot Blockchain ( RIOT ) as a barometer to show that not all miners have been selling down their treasuries this year: BTC holdings (Company releases) Argo had 2,700 BTC in March and just 512 BTC at the end of September. While Argo's BTC sales started a little bit earlier than Core's, we do see Argo's BTC selling getting more aggressive in the last few months: Monthly HODL change (Company releases) Argo sold down by 34% in July and by 53% in September. While Argo's drawdown has been slower than Core Scientific's over the last 6 months, the company is running out of BTC to sell to raise cash. Baby Bonds Collapsing But it isn't just the drawdown in the company's Bitcoin treasury or the selling of machines that I think are the most concerning indicators for Argo. If the market expected Argo to survive crypto winter, I don't think the ARBKL baby bond shares would be trading at 51 cents on the dollar: 1yr ARBKL share return (Seeking Alpha) The 90% drawdown in the price of the common shares is bad. But the collapse of the ARBKL shares is worse from an optics perspective in my view. These shares have a value of $25 and pay an 8.75% yield at par. At a current share price of $12.75, ARBKL is trading at a 49% discount to par and offering a 17.15% yield. This is either a huge opportunity or a clear sign that the market doesn't think Argo can pay its bills. I'm leaning it's the latter. Risks in Going Short While I think Argo Blockchain is in a race against time, I would only short after a 90% selloff if you are a highly experienced trader. Argo's success is still tied to Bitcoin at the end of the day. Also, according to iBorrowDesk, shares available have been trending down the last few days and cost to borrow is trending higher: ARBK (iBorrowDesk) While the fundamentals look absolutely terrible for Argo, sentiment can change if Bitcoin starts to rise and profitability in the sector gets a rebound. I'm of the opinion that there are several miners that will do better if BTC does indeed turn it around, but a short position in ARBK could get wiped out very quickly if BTC has a sustained bear market rally and there are reasons to suggest a move like that is possible. If you do go short ARBK it might be wise to go long one of the better positioned miners as a hedge. Summary The biggest problem for every Bitcoin miner at the moment is the margin squeeze from low BTC prices. If you are of the opinion that Bitcoin is going lower, then I think Argo Blockchain is highly likely to be the next listed miner to take a dive. The company has a high debt burden, high costs, is selling assets for cash, has very little BTC left to sell, and has baby bonds priced at 50% of face. Even if Bitcoin rallies, there is a chance ARBK shares still go down through dilution if the company decides to raise capital through an offering. If you're long, I'd sell and move on. If you want to short it, I'd wait for a pop in price and hit the rip.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ICO | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4550560-argo-blockchain-next-miner-squeeze-casualty?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/3465692.jpeg

42413765,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlC0vE,1666991604,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Heads for Best Week in 3 Months,"Price Action  Bitcoin (BTC) rose Friday after a U.S. government report showed the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge rose slower than expected last month. The reason that matters is because it shows progress in the Fed’s campaign to tamp down the pace of price increases, in turn signaling that it might be able to let up sooner rather than later in tightening monetary policy – seen as a negative for prices of risky assets, from stocks to bitcoin.  The oldest cryptocurrency’s push past $20,000 has turned the market mood more bullish. Bitcoin’s 5.6% gain since Sunday represents the biggest weekly gain in three months. But the crucial test will come next week when the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee meets. Most traders expect the U.S. central bank to raise the main interest rate by 75 basis points (0.75 percentage point), but the drama is likely to come from whatever Fed Chair Jerome Powell signals about the committee’s plans for its December meeting.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures the performance of a basket of cryptocurrencies, recently rose 1.8% over the past 24 hours.  In traditional markets, the Standard & Poor’s 500 rose, with tech stocks boosted by an encouraging earnings report from Apple.  Among crypto stocks on Friday, shares of bitcoin miner Core Scientific (CORZ) tanked after the company warned it may have to explore bankruptcy.

Technical Take  Bitcoin, Ether Press Higher as Momentum Increases  By Glenn Williams Jr  Investors should also weigh on-chain analytics to ensure they are adopting a measured approach. Over the past week, large BTC holders have been moving coins to exchanges.  For investors with a bullish outlook, this isn't the best sign because coins are often moved to exchanges to ready them for rapid sale.  However, this trend may just be a preventative measure ahead of Nov. 10 consumer price index data. Still, the move to exchanges appears to have stabilized as of Oct. 25.

42394169,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXtjj,1666989000,Reading Elon’s Tea Leaves,"Electric car mogul/aspiring Martian Elon Musk took over Twitter. This could mean a lot for free speech online, or not. We just don’t know. Here’s an attempt at parsing his statements and actions over the past few months.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Reading Elon’s Tea Leaves  The narrative  Elon Musk finally took over Twitter. It took a while, and Twitter had to sue him to force him to close the deal, but it happened.  Why it matters  Twitter is a pretty central place for a lot of the crypto world. I wouldn’t go so far as to say it’s the main town square, but it’s certainly significant. It’s also a place where many users are able to interact pseudonymously with each other, a state of affairs Musk has – intentionally or not – threatened in the past.  Breaking it down  I have a confession to make. I had no idea what to write about this week. I took some time off last week, went out and socialized and returned to stare at a google document that was as blank as my brain.  Luckily, on Thursday night, something happened:  It’s official now. Elon Musk bought Twitter, for real this time*!  (*Though admittedly, as of the time I’m writing this, there's no press release or EDGAR filing or anything from the company itself, but it sure looks official based on multiple reports from news organizations.)  I wrote about this whole thing when Musk first announced he had a deal with Twitter’s heads, so it seems only fair to revisit that newsletter and see what, if anything, has changed since then.  There's two ways we could approach this. One is, “lol Elon spent $31 billion and a bunch of banks spent a further $13 billion to buy a company worth $41 billion at the time of closing and quite a bit less than that over the past few months, and this only after several months of legal wrangling that ultimately led to the same outcome it would have had Musk not tried to pull out.”  The other is, Twitter might now have a new approach to the content (tweets) on its platform.  The key thing, to me anyway, is we still don’t know what Musk actually plans. He has published a few tweets saying he is pro-free speech, but on Thursday said in a message (to advertisers?) that “Twitter obviously cannot become a free-for-all hellscape.”  Recall that when he originally announced his intent to buy Twitter, he also said he wanted to authenticate every user because of the bot issue. In April, I wrote that the implications of Twitter collecting personally identifiable information – if that is how this shakes out – are troubling. Twitter’s now apparently likely to experience a staffing shakeup, which isn’t reassuring either.  Obviously it’s far too soon to actually tell what he’ll do with Twitter, but this is his chance to walk the talk on free speech.  One of the first things Musk did was fire Twitter’s leadership, including CEO Parag Agrawal, Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal, General Counsel Sean Edgett and Head of Legal Policy, Trust and Safety Vijaya Gadde. In all honesty, props to them – they took on Musk, forced him to fold and now they walk away with a collective $200 million.  But Gadde’s departure in particular will be interesting. She was denigrated for apparently being responsible for banning users like former President Donald Trump (and it is baffling to me that a decision like that did not end up in front of former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey) but the more important role she played was defending the rights of Twitter users to be pseudonymous.  Last I checked, Crypto Twitter had a fairly large number of users who preferred to be anonymous for various reasons, including that they may get sued if they weren’t. We just saw a prominent bitcoiner have to defend himself in court over things he tweeted. Twitter at large has occasionally been sued by people hoping to unmask users.  Governments especially might have an interest in Twitter’s new leadership. Within hours of Musk’s takeover, we saw government officials in various locations warning him that they expect him to abide by their own regulations. Musk’s assertion that Twitter would follow the laws of the land is also relevant here.  And, for whatever reason, a few months ago Musk wrote a column for a regulatory entity in China that is apparently tasked with censorship. I don’t know what to make of that.  Musk now takes on his third major CEO role (after Tesla and SpaceX), which he runs in addition to various other groups or companies he supports (the Boring Company, Neuralink, for example).  And just to look back at a previous prediction, back in April I wrote, “This could take up to six months, according to Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal.”  Agrawal called it – it took more or less exactly six months.  I also wrote, “Plenty could happen in that time (including Musk changing his mind, which, let’s face it, isn’t exactly out of the realm of possibility).”  Musk did indeed change his mind, or at least try to. I wonder how much the attorneys involved made thanks to that decision.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  N/A  Outside CoinDesk:  (The Washington Post) A Post reporter followed one of the survivors of the Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde, Texas, over the summer. This is quite a report, and it really is worth your time.  (Bloomberg Businessweek) Bloomberg Businessweek has its second-ever cover-to-cover story, and of course it’s on crypto and of course it’s written by the one and only Matt Levine. I also thought this short clip of an interview he sat for with Bloomberg’s Sonali Basak and Kailey Leinz provided a fascinating 150-second summary of where he stands today.  (The Washington Post) The bugs are disappearing.  (FDIC) The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation published the results of its 2021 survey of unbanked and underbanked households. If we are to accept the premise that this is an issue the crypto industry wants to address, it’s obviously worth looking at data on it.

42420882,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtZJl,1666987591,"Bitcoin, Ether Press Higher as Momentum Increases","Bitcoin's price was up about 0.3% over the past 24 hours, the latest surge in an upbeat week that saw the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization climb about 8% in value.  The spike came amid new hopes that the U.S. Federal Reserve would be able to scale back its monetary hawkishness sometime early next year, and a few mildly encouraging economic indicators.  Ether's price recently increased 0.6% from Thursday, same time, and was up approximately 19% over the past week.  As October closes, investors may wish to look back before taking stock of the current and likely future crypto climate.  On June 13, BTC plunged 15%. Fears about inflation had heightened and the U.S. Federal Reserve was days away from boosting interest rates 75 basis points for the first time since 1994.  Lender Celsius Network had just announced a pause in user withdrawals, and hedge fund Three Arrows Capital was a day out from announcing troubles that ultimately led to its liquidation.  Anchored Volume Weighted Average Price (AVWAP), a technical tool developed by Brian Shannon, CMT, allows users to track an asset’s Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) from a moment of their choosing, including dates and specific events.  Since June 13, BTC's price has begun to approach the AVWAP level. The implication is that through all the turmoil, and incorporating asset volume, investors who went long BTC from June 13 forward are, on average, moving closer to break-even status.  AVWAP levels can often serve as levels of support and/or resistance, so prices surpassing this mark could be significant.  Using AVWAP for ETH, and anchoring from June 13, shows the price surpassed AVWAP levels on Oct. 25. ETH has also begun to outperform relative to BTC, as the ETH/BTC ratio increased 3% over the last seven days.  The surge in crypto prices late this week was also characterized by increased momentum.  Momentum, in this case characterized by the 14-day RSI, is accelerating at a slightly faster pace than prices BTC and ETH prices, which is a bullish signal.  Investors should also weigh on-chain analytics to ensure they are adopting a measured approach. Over the past week, large BTC holders have been moving coins onto exchanges.  For investors with a bullish outlook, this isn't the best sign because coins are often moved to exchanges to ready them for rapid sale.  However, this trend may just be a preventative measure ahead of Nov. 10 consumer price index data. Still, the move to exchanges appears to have stabilized as of Oct. 25.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/28/bitcoin-ether-press-higher-as-momentum-increases,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/23b772f1b042553da8224d031a1337af94f7f3ca-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Shares have fallen about 80% in value over the last five days.  The stock garnered multiple analyst downgrades this week owing to the miner's financial concerns. Most recent was Barclays, which cut the stock to equalweight from overweight, and its price target by 92% to 25 cents from $3.  “We are moving to the sidelines as we await further clarification on strategic alternatives and potential capital structure changes,” Barclays analyst Ramsey El-Assal wrote in a research note to clients. Another Wall Street investment bank, BTIG, lowered the stock's rating to neutral from buy on Thursday, echoing similar sentiment.  Core Scientific's woes reflect the depressed state of the bitcoin mining industry, with firms squeezed between high electricity costs and a muted bitcoin price. Most recently, one of Core Scientific's peers, Compute North, filed for bankruptcy in September owing as much as $500 million to at least 200 creditors.

Still, during an appearance on CoinDesk TV’s “All About Bitcoin'' on Thursday, Goldsmith Romero said because digital assets are different than traditional financial products, “we have to be a little careful about going to bespoke treatments because we don’t know the consequences of doing so,"" explaining that officials should review the established ways of regulating traditional financial markets to see whether they can be applied to crypto.  Meanwhile, clarity from Congress would be “helpful” in defining which government agency should be responsible for regulating digital assets, Goldsmith Romero said.  “There’s a regulatory gap in that there is no one market regulator over bitcoin or other commodities [and] digital assets that are not securities,” she said.

42411073,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giBW7b,1666983003,NFTs Are Going Big in Latin America Amid a Crypto Boom,"With an increasing number of financial and political crises in recent years, Latin American citizens have found in crypto a powerful tool to cope with the instability. Now, non-fungible tokens (NFT) are booming in the region, with the goal of solving real problems and not speculation.  High inflation has led millions of Latin Americans to seek refuge in cryptocurrencies, with stablecoins leading the way. According to Mastercard, 51% of consumers in the region have made at least one transaction with crypto. Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and Ecuador are among the top 20 countries with the greatest crypto adoption, according to Chainalysis' 2022 Global Crypto Adoption Index.  NFTs have reached mainstream audiences in developed countries through projects including Bored Ape Yacht Club or CryptoPunks, which have now become highly sought-after collectables. Latin American companies, by contrast, are investing in NFT use cases such as supporting local artists, allowing customers to resell airline tickets or donating to nonprofit organizations.  Enigma.art is a decentralized platform that mainly provides NFT’ development services for well-known traditional Latin American artists, ranging from fine arts to the music industry. It connects artists with their fans through NFTs’ meet-and-greet tickets, collectable cards or original songs.  “When we entered the crypto universe in 2021 and discovered what an NFT was, we wanted to buy an original piece by a Latin American artist – until we realized that there were practically none. So we created our own platform to link fans with artists through NFTs,” Facundo Migoya, Enigma.art CEO, told CoinDesk.  Facundo and Manuel Migoya — age 21 and 18 respectively — co-founded Enigma.art in 2021. It has more than 5,000 users and at least 1,500 wallets connected. The platform allows users to find and buy original songs from the artists, who receive a royalty percentage of the purchase, dissociate the voice from each of the different instruments and then mix them differently to create a new track.  The platform currently works with artists such as Marta Minujin, an internationally known conceptual artist from Argentina who sold her first NFT for 24 ETH (approximately $30,720). Or Bizarrap, an Argentine music producer who reached the first place on Spotify's Top 50 Global ranking and already sold his first NFT for 100 ETH ($128,000), part of a larger NFT collection in production.  “We are still creating and developing new ways for fans to invest in their favorite artists, with early access and fractional ownership over the artist's new songs through NFTs, for example,” added Migoya.  But NFTs in Latin America are not only about the fanciest industries, as regional NFT companies are trying to generate innovation in more traditional sectors.  In August, TravelX, a marketplace for tokenized travel products, started offering 2.5 million airplane tickets from the low-cost Argentine airline Flybondi, which are tokenized when purchased and converted into non-fungible tokens called NFTickets.  “When clients bought tickets and then couldn’t take that flight, money was lost,” said Federico Pastori, Flybondi chief commercial officer. “This way, we are creating an official secondary market where people can sell and resell them until three days before the takeoff.”  After acquiring an NFTicket, a customer can auction, sell, transfer, gift or exchange them through a peer-to-peer system on TravelX, that the startup’s chief blockchain officer, Facundo Martin Diaz, told CoinDesk when it launched.  “Imagine if a big event is happening, customers could buy several tickets and then resell or auction them for double the price, the possibilities with NFTickets are endless,” Pastori added.  The NFTickets can currently be purchased with fiat money or USDC through a wallet created in TravelX or through BinancePay and more recently with Lemon, a Latin American crypto exchange. Both TravelX and Flybondi receive 2% commission on every transaction.  A million avatars  Lemon, with more than a million users in Argentina and Brazil, launched in August the biggest NFT collection in the world up to date, creating a unique NFT avatar for each one of its users.  “We saw that NFTs around the world were mainly used for speculative purposes and also that Latin Americans found the existing process to obtain an NFT difficult, so we gave free access to NFTs to all of our users,” Lemon CEO Marcelo Cavazzoli told CoinDesk.  The avatar NFTs, called “Lemmys,” are unique and randomly generated when users activate them. For now, they cannot be modified, traded or purchased, although it will be possible in the near future, Cavazzoli stated, adding that more than 400,000 of the million users have claimed their NFTs.  With a more supportive approach, Pequeños Pasos (Little Steps), a non-governmental organization (NGO) with global operations that develop integration programs for families in vulnerable communities around Argentina, launched in May its first NFT collection of digitized drawings made by children participating in integration programs.  “The NFT project is meant for people to get involved with the organization in a more tangible way and later get rewards like special participation in our events,” Matías Ronconi, president at Pequeños Pasos, told CoinDesk.  The NFT project of Pequeños Pasos was assisted by Santiago Siri, an Argentine contributor to the Proof of Humanity project and developer of the universal basic income (UBI) ERC-20 token. Up to now, it has sold 25 pieces for $50 each through OpenSea.  “NFT adoption is still new in Latin America, but we wanted to be part of it from the beginning,” Ronconi said.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Marina Lammertyn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/10/28/nfts-are-going-big-in-latin-america-amid-a-crypto-boom,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/36012690419e4a597be4937cb19f15ec0b387786-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42413756,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlC0kw,1666983001,Ethereum Scaling Platform zkSync v2 Goes Live Amid Controversy,"After a 100-day countdown, Matter Labs released a long-awaited second version of its Ethereum scaling platform, zkSync, on Friday.  In the lead-up to the much-hyped “Baby Alpha” launch, zkSync – an Ethereum “rollup” network that offers users the ability to transact quickly and cheaply without sacrificing security – faced a volley of criticism from skeptics and competitors wary of its most audacious technology claims.  In particular, criticism has been leveled at Matter Labs’ marketing, which positions the zkSync v2 platform as the first of its kind to “launch” on Ethereum’s mainnet – beating out fast-approaching competitors from Polygon and Scroll.  Read more: Ethereum’s Rollup Race: What is a ‘True’ zkEVM?  Though the platform is technically going live on Ethereum’s main network, its features will be extremely limited for the time being. On its official road map, Matter Labs said the Baby Alpha launch would not be open to external projects, and would instead be a way to run zkSync’s systems “through a series of real-money stress tests that will help us verify the production system is working correctly and performing as expected.”  A “Fair Launch” open to outside teams will, according to the road map, take place in the coming months.  Although access to zkSync’s v2 network will be heavily gated for now, it is the first of a trio of upcoming zkEVM projects to launch in some form on Ethereum’s mainnet. All of the projects aim to offer compatibility with any Ethereum smart contract, and they promise to offer massive security and efficiency advantages over the network’s incumbent scaling solutions.  What is zkSync?  With the Ethereum community’s embrace of a rollup-centric road map, most activity on the network in the coming years is expected to go through layer 2 rollup platforms – quick and cheap networks that sit atop Ethereum as an answer to its exorbitant fees and sluggish speeds.  zkSync is a “zero-knowledge” (ZK) rollup – a kind of layer 2 network that bundles up user transactions and then passes them down to Ethereum so they can be written to its ledger. ZK-rollups use complex cryptographic proofs to prove that the data they pass down to Ethereum has not been tampered with.  Unlike the previous version of its rollup, zkSync’s v2 platform will be fully compatible with all Ethereum smart contracts – the bite-sized computer programs that power apps on the blockchain.  Responding to critics  At the core of the criticisms of zkSync are questions around whether its zk-SNARKs – the complicated mathematical proof system that is supposed to make the whole network tick – actually exist.  zkSync’s proof system is supposed to make its system more secure than scaling platforms such as Polygon PoS and Ronin – so-called sidechains that pass data to Ethereum without allowing actors on the layer 1 base network to check for correctness.  Steven Goldfeder, the chief executive of Offchain Labs, which creates a competing platform to zkSync called Arbitrum, claimed earlier this month that there was no evidence that zkSync’s prover technology worked as claimed.  “We are NOT 12 days away from the first zkEVM on mainnet in any meaningful way,” he tweeted in reference to zkSync. “If you read the fine print [...] their testnet still doesn't have zk-proofs enabled (!!),” he continued.  Matter Labs disputed these claims to CoinDesk, however. “We would simply point to the fact that we have shipped our end-to-end prover exactly as defined with public verification and that we have shipped it exactly on schedule as outlined in our public road map – milestone 3,” Steve Newcomb, Matter Labs’ chief product officer, told CoinDesk in an interview.  “Tweets like [those from] the founder of Arbitrum are simply false and are a bad look for our entire space,” he continued. “We would love to see an industry standard for open source, for mainnet releases and many other areas – it would prevent false claims.”  zkSync has $62 million locked in the first version of its platform, which was limited to specific kinds of blockchain applications. This number is expected to increase with the more generalizable zkSync v2 platform.  In comparison, the leading layer 2 platforms – “Optimistic rollups” from Arbitrum and Optimism – currently comprise around 80% of Ethereum’s layer 2 ecosystem and hold a combined $3 billion in total value locked.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MATIC | TECHNOLOGY | ARB,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/10/28/ethereum-scaling-platform-zksync-v2-goes-live-amid-controversy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2603cd3b3498f41e43650baa2356a1bef63f9b09-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394127,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXsf3,1666980310,"Dear Elon, This Is How to Decentralize Twitter and Give the Internet Back to Everyone","Dear Elon,  Congrats on buying Twitter! We’ve been watching the process unfold with enthusiasm because of all the times you’ve mentioned the importance of decentralization. You and your team seem to have the vision to use this wonderful platform as the lever to kickstart a more mature and self-sovereign web.  With the right design, a decentralized Twitter would catalyze a new kind of internet – fundamentally changing the relationship between users and platforms. People could own the data they generate across applications across the web.  David Sneider is a co-founder of Lit Protocol, a decentralized cryptography network.  A look at Twitter’s (TWTR) product lines like profiles, posts, messaging system and advertising could provide insight into what the self-sovereign web would look like and how to go about onboarding people.  Vision  As we can tell from your texts with former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, it seems you believe Twitter today is lingering at the limits of the utility it can provide. To become more useful to users and develop further as a “protocol” rather than as a company, we can learn a lot from email.  Email is a protocol. You might be using Microsoft Office, Dorsey might be using Proton, and I’m on Gmail. We can all easily message one another and be on the same thread, but see and write our emails via different application interfaces (e.g. Outlook, Gmail).  See also: Why the Decentralized Web's Development Is Unstoppable | Opinion  This model can be expanded to social media using systems like Filecoin, Arweave, Ceramic and Polybase. Users' connections and posts wouldn’t be confined to a single “walled garden” like Twitter or Facebook, but live on the open web. This data can still be private and permissioned (and therefore monetized) via threshold cryptography-powered access control (like what Lit is building).  On decentralized, user sovereign and privacy-focused social-media protocols, users will have the ability to consent to which applications and connections can see their content across interface platforms just like email.  Onboarding  One of the biggest hurdles in Web3 is wallet user experience. For some people, self-custody of keys is a privilege, but for many more, it’s a burden. As a result, in the past year, there’s been an explosion of interest in multiparty computation (MPC).  MPC wallets enable users to sign into apps with a traditional login, pin code and biometric with their wallets without the burden of self-custody or having to rely on a centralized key holder custodian.  Public user data  For the parts of the social graphs that are public, like Twitter today, there are already a number of active projects that have created open-source infrastructure to help people own their data. Lens Protocol and Orbis, for instance, are live now.  Private user data  Of course, not all social data is public. Often the basic components in social networking and media, like a person’s connections, profile info, posts and messages are private, meaning that they are viewable only to authorized people. Or, at least, it would be preferable to have that option.  Today, on Twitter, this data is largely locked within Twitter's and Facebook’s servers. The alternative is to store this data encrypted on the open web and give the user fine-grained access control over who can decrypt it.  This isn’t a new idea in online social networking, and this system is sync with the early days of the web and the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) encryption program still used by many. (PGP allows people to post their public key anywhere, to receive messages that only the private key holder can read.)  Threshold cryptography advances these privacy standards by allowing users to create rules around who can view their posts. And if decentralized social protocols are widely adopted, this encrypted data could then be used across “the open web.”  For example, Alice might make a post with a setting that says “anyone on my friends list can see this post."" Bob, Alice’s friend, could decrypt that post on any platform by proving his identity via a signature from his wallet.  Advertising  Ads are often considered a dirty subject in certain Web3 circles, but the fact is only about 10% of internet users pay for premium apps and software. That means most people use software services with ads.  Tracking a “conversion” for a purchase is largely done via last-click attribution where the publisher (e.g. Twitter) has some software running on its page that indicates to the advertisers (e.g. an e-commerce store) that a user has clicked on an ad. When that person makes a purchase, the publisher is compensated.  This too can be decentralized. The system mentioned above for user data can also be applied to ad attribution. The ”last click” is written to a person’s data hub (encrypted and stored on the open web) as a verifiable credential and then the advertiser can get permission to decrypt this data.  See also: The Decentralized Mystique  As the world’s regulators continue to crack down on tracking cookies, bringing the user and his or her consent into the system for tracking ad clicks and conversions presents a long-term path forward for ad-supported publishers.  Next steps  The decentralized networks to support global scale are still maturing, but there’s never been a better time to start laying the foundation.

SLNH risks over-centralization where 60% of mining operations will be centralized in Texas by Q4 and up to 90% in the long-run. Findings contradict SLNH's claim to have one of the industry's lowest mining costs when referring to cost of revenue (mining) and all-in business costs. Similar to MARA, SLNH is heavily burdened by preferred share commitments on top of high level of leverage. Despite SLNH's 70% decline since our previous coverage and 90% from its all-time high, we still couldn't find sufficient investment value proposition to justify an investment. Introduction In our previous coverage , we argued that Soluna Holdings' ( SLNH ) curtailed energy business model isn't sustainable due to efforts in reducing curtailed energy (SLNH's main source of income). In addition, SLNH's foreseeable capacity ( Q3: 1.02 EH/s ) severely lags behind the industry (Table 1). At the very least, these imply limited upside potential. At that time of writing, Soluna was trading (market cap = ~$63.5mil) above its adjusted book value ($37.15mil = $2.8mil cash + $68.245mil PP&E + $14.90 prepaid - $48.8 Total Liability), implying excessive downside risk. The combination of limited upside potential and excessive downside risk suggests that Soluna could not offer sufficient margin of safety. So far, Soluna's share price has reflected this pessimistic outlook where the company has severely underperformed the industry (Fig 1). Our thesis was further validated by SLNH itself when it announced that it has priced its previously announced public offering at $1.44 per share , about 20% lower than the market price before the announcement. To make things worse, SLNH's share price has suffered another leg down and is trading at $1.20. In light of SLNH's Q2 performance, this article aims expand our initial analysis to uncover an additional downside risk and examine whether SLNH offers a sufficient margin of safety after the 70% decline since our previous coverage.

Soluna Severely Underperformed The Industry (YCharts) Another Potential Victim From Overcentralizing in Texas We explained that Texas offers low-cost energy, crypto-mining-friendly regulations, and opportunities in the curtailed energy market due to local transmission constraints. As a result, many major Bitcoin mining companies have decided to locate the majority of their Bitcoin mining operations in Texas. This decision may also prove problematic for these Bitcoin mining companies because Texas's power grid has suffered from overheating and potential blackouts in summers and winters. During the 2022 summer , Bitcoin miners in Texas had to halt mining operations to prevent blackouts from the summer heat. During the 2021 winter , Bitcoin miners also had to halt mining operations to prevent blackouts due to winter storms. The winter storm was particularly devastating which saw 10 million Texans without electricity and hundreds of casualties. Due to these events, scrutiny on crypto mining activities in Texas is gathering momentum while the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) has recently announced a slowing of application approvals. These events could significantly impact SLNH's expansion plans in the state because SLNH has yet to obtain approval from ERCOT to energize Project Dorothy, as of September 2022 . Currently, SLNH's operations are located mainly in Kentucky (50MW: Project Sophie , Project Marie ). In the short run, Project Dorothy (50MW) is expected to provide 50MW capacity by 2024Q4. This represents ~60% (=1.4 EH/s / 2.4 EH/s ) of SLNH's total mining capacity. Over the long run, Project Dorothy is expected to provide 150MW of capacity, representing over 75% of SLNH's total Bitcoin mining operation. If we were to consider SLNH's 2 other projects in Texas (Project Kati: 150MW; Project Cynthia: 130MW) over a longer time horizon ( no timeline yet ), over 90% of Soluna's operation will be located in Texas. Therefore, there is evidence of over-centralization risk which further adds to the downside. We showed that these events could undo MARA's 23 EH/s capacity expansion efforts and now the same can be applied to SLNH. SLNH's Mining Efficiency is Average at Best Another claim by Soluna is that the company has one of the lowest Bitcoin mining cost in the industry: Soluna remains one of the lowest-cost Bitcoin miners, and we believe the terms of this new agreement strongly insulate it from recent fluctuations in fuel charges. We're not aware of the basis of the claim, but we found contradictions compared to our findings. When we compare to other Bitcoin miners (both big and small; Table 2), we can see that SLNH's Bitcoin mining cost efficiency is average at best. When other business costs are included, SLNH is severely underperforming the industry (Table 3). That being said, we should give SLNH credit for matching HUT's and RIOT's mining costs despite being 69% smaller than HUT (= 0.87 EH/s SLNH / 2.78 EH/s HUT; Q2 basis), and 80% smaller than RIOT (= 0.87 EH/s SLNH / 4.44 EH/s RIOT; Q2 basis). Another positive take is that Project Dorothy is expected to increase Bitcoin production more than the increase in non-operating costs, which will ultimately reduce all-in business costs per BTC. Project Dorothy is expected to more than double Bitcoin production (from 3.6 BTC per day to 8 BTC per day) by 2022Q4. However, this positive observation is quickly offset by the risks from ERCOT approval and a bearish Bitcoin outlook . Moreover, we need 2 to 3 more quarters to confirm the positive observation.

MARA is more leveraged compared to peers where total liability ($0.76bn) is 53% of total adjusted assets ($1.445bn), which is detrimental to its equity-based valuation. In comparison, SLNH's total liability ($41.4mil) is 40% of adjusted total asset ($102.33mil = $4.63mil cash + $87mil PP&E + $10.7mil prepaids). Unlike MARA (which has no preferred stock outstanding ), SLNH carries the burden of preferred stock. As of Q2 , SLNH has 3mil preferred stock 3mil outstanding 9.0% $25 liquidation preference Series A cumulative perpetual preferred stock. In other words, SLNH received less than $75mil ""perpetual loan"" funding (because preferred shares are issued at lower prices ) but has to pay interest on a $75mil loan. If SLNH were to buy back all 3mil outstanding preferred shares today, it'll theoretically cost SLNH about $12mil (=$4 x 3mil). Depending on how investors want to look at it, SLNH's total liability + preferred stocks ($53.4mil) would at least be 52% of its adjusted total assets, similar to MARA. Therefore, SLNH's adjusted book value would be at most $49mil (=$102.33-$53.4mil). On this basis, SLNH (market cap = $29mil) is now trading below its book value. But what stops SLNH from becoming an attractive investment is the lack of Bitcoin holdings. The main attraction of a Bitcoin mining company trading below book value is the upside potential derived from the rebound in Bitcoin price. For instance, HUT's current Bitcoin reserve alone would already be worth $587mil (= 8,388 BTC * $70,000) when Bitcoin reclaims its all-time high, more than its current $438mil market cap. SLNH does not possess such upside potential due to the lack of Bitcoin reserve nor does it possess the mining capacity (only ~1 EH/s) to derive such value. Verdict We've expanded our initial analysis on SLNH to uncover an additional risk from over-centralization and showed that SLNH is not positioned well to benefit from a Bitcoin recovery due to a lack of Bitcoin reserves and mining capacity. Furthermore, SLNH carries a heavy financial burden from the preferred shares outstanding during this period of distress. Unfortunately, we have to maintain our verdict that SLNH still does not offer sufficient investment value proposition even after the 70% decline since our previous coverage. In addition, investors should also be concerned that Soluna has yet to fulfill its monthly preferred shares dividend commitment in October.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4550417-soluna-holdings-limited-upside?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/3460148.jpeg

42394167,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXteb,1666976801,Save Billions by Using the Blockchain to Distribute Federal Disaster Relief Money,"Adelle Nazarian of the American Blockchain PAC and Alex Allaire of the American Blockchain Initiative recently provided, in The National Interest’s Techland section, 10 substantive legislative proposals for the responsible development of digital assets.  The fourth of these, keeping in mind that fraud and the misappropriation of federal disaster relief funds are all too common, states that we would benefit greatly from creating a proof-of-stake blockchain platform to distribute federal disaster relief funds.  Todd White is the founder of, and Ralph Benko senior counselor to, the American Blockchain PAC.  How much would the blockchain save us taxpayers? “Billions and billions!” (H/t, Carl Sagan.)  The Washington Post has reported the U.S. Justice Department estimates more than $8 billion in alleged fraud just in the federal government’s coronavirus relief programs, bolstering companies that did not actually exist or wholesale identity theft by transnational crime syndicates to file for fraudulent unemployment benefits.  The problem is almost certainly worse. The Washington Post, again, reported the $6 trillion in loans, grants, checks and emergency assistance created “a unique and lasting strain” on ensuring the funds had been put to good use. And that “the money remains hard to track.”  See also: Blockchain Means So Much More Than Crypto | Opinion  The real culprit? The federal government’s archaic financial infrastructure.  Most of us by now know that many roads and bridges, much of the electric grid, water and wastewater systems are dilapidated. Less well known? Many of our public financial systems are antiquated, too.  Blockchain-based enterprise platforms can be programmed to restrict disbursements to legitimate purposes, producing a tamperproof, easily audited record. Why hasn’t this been already adopted? Consider Sir Arthur C. Clarke’s Law: “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”  One of us worked in the U.S. Department of Energy back in the mid-1980s and observed the procurement of the agency’s first desktop computers. It felt somewhat like the scene in the 1951 movie, “The Day The Earth Stood Still” that depicted the trepidation of the Earthling civilians and soldiers surrounding the flying saucer that landed on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Klaatu barada nikto!  Back during tech’s Cretaceous Period, a speechwriter to President Ronald Reagan told the story of when the president’s staff rolled an early PC into the Oval Office primed to send the first presidential email. The White House had put red (fittingly!) tape around the Enter button to show the president where to press Send.  Reagan turned to them and said presidential predecessor “Jimmy Carter told me not to push any red buttons!” Reagan, understandably, declined to press.  The pace of the federal government is reminiscent of that old “Speed Bump” cartoon of a wrinkled old snail telling a group of astonished young snails: “Then suddenly… whoosh! The glacier came out of nowhere and overtook all but the speediest of your ancestors ...!”  Hilarious. But the joke’s on us.  Our financial infrastructure is not designed to distribute billions, even trillions, of dollars of relief funds both fast and well. There is evidence that substantial bleed-out occurs for all federal emergency disbursements. It’s reportedly worse for foreign aid.  See also: Bitcoin Is the Song That Does Not End | Opinion  Disbursements are right in the blockchain’s sweet spot. While it would not yet be a simple “off-the-shelf” purchase, a fraction of the lost $8 billion (or much more) devoted to R&D by such agencies as DARPA, NSF, NIST, the National Labs, NASA and other teched-up agencies and procurements at scale by the Department of Defense, General Services Administration and others would surely conjure the magic of the free market to produce a great, scalable blockchain platform.  The return on investment for the taxpayers and America? Immense.  That’s what happened with computer chips. NASA’s big purchases of semiconductor chips drove the industry’s costs dramatically down. Chips became so cheap they replaced vacuum tubes and printed circuits in everything from radios and TVs to computers, automobiles, airplanes and, well, just about everything.  How immense? Consider that today’s iPhone would have cost over $101 million to build in the year 1991. Now, there’s a supercomputer in every pocket.  Hope Reese, author of ”The Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America,” interviewed at OneZero, pointed out how “the military spending and space program spending that started under [President Dwight] Eisenhower was the launching pad for Silicon Valley's rocket.”  The federal government as a market leader? Flunks the Libertarian Purity Test.  See also: Crypto: The Gift That Keeps On Giving (to Charity) | Opinion  And yet, Congress? Consider the massive savings to the taxpayer!

42394136,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXtEx,1666976534,‘Crypto CAT Bonds’ – A Killer App for Digital Assets?,"Bermuda has long been an innovator in insurance and, under the leadership of its crypto believer Premier David Burt, it is now looking to be an innovator in digital assets.  Conversations I had on the island during the Bermuda Tech Summit this week have led me to believe there’s a huge opportunity to combine those two strengths into a powerful use case for crypto. At a time when the industry needs to emphasize real world applications – rather than simply riding the boom-bust cycle of “number go up” speculation – this one’s a doozy.  It’s based on an idea from Joe Ziolkowski, the CEO of crypto-focused insurer Relm. He wants to offer investors in staked token pools the chance to apply those holdings as collateral for special purpose vehicles that underwrite reinsurance contracts. It could be a solution to an alarming multi-billion-dollar shortfall facing the reinsurance industry, a vital sector that exists to absorb the risks taken by insurance companies so the latter can continue to expand their policy issuance.  In our “Money Reimagined” podcast this week, Ziolkowski said that on Jan. 1, $20 billion in reinsurance contracts are due to roll over – meaning they’ll need to be refunded – and that the estimated amount committed is just $2 billion. Other people in the Bermuda insurance industry told me that the full-year 2023 shortfall in reinsurance is as high as $60 billion.  Here’s the problem: Insurance claims triggered by Hurricane Ian’s record-breaking destruction last month – with total losses seen as high as $75 billion – have combined with elevated uncertainty around climate change and with the general investor risk aversion stoked by rising interest rates to leave hedge funds and other entities reluctant to commit capital to the industry.  Many fear a lack of catastrophe risk insurance will tank housing markets in Florida and elsewhere. It's a really big, little-discussed problem. And crypto could contribute to solving it.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Staked tokens as collateral  Ziolkowski is proposing a new version of so-called insurance-linked securities (ILS) that first arose in Bermuda after Hurricane Andrew in 1992 left insurers with a then-unprecedented $15.5 billion bill. Ever since, Bermuda has been the world leader for regulating ILS and one of the top three reinsurance hubs in the world.  These ILS instruments, which include catastrophe bonds (colloquially known as CAT bonds) are issued by special purpose vehicles to external investors whose funding pledges provide the collateral to backstop the reinsurance risk. The ILS market has allowed hedge funds, pension funds and other non-insurance traditional investing institutions to tap an additional source of high, uncorrelated returns. In turn, that has allowed the insurance industry to continue to expand with its risks appropriately underwritten.  Ziolkowski believes an on-chain, smart contract-powered version of ILS could be backed with tokens locked up in the staking pools that run validators on proof-of-stake blockchains. In an interesting application of on-chain programmability to real-world problems, the staked funds could be locked up via a smart contract that would execute a reinsurance payout if one is triggered.  Either way, they would deliver a reliable interest rate-determined, uncorrelated return to crypto investors above the staking returns they already receive. The concept might not close the reinsurance funding gap entirely, but with tens of billions of dollars worth of tokens now being staked it has significant potential.  Insurance as opportunity for crypto  This on-chain reinsurance idea is one way in which insurance could be a key element in driving crypto adoption, thereby providing greater stability and security to decentralized finance (DeFi).  Crypto companies have huge demand for regular off-chain insurance. Traditional insurers have been reluctant to provide directors and officers coverage, liability coverage and cybercrime coverage. Seeing the opportunity, Relm came up with risk assessment techniques for crypto companies, including analyses of software code, reserve practices and audit policies. As a result, it secured an Innovative Insurer General Business (IIGB) license from Bermuda’s regulatory agency.  Relm’s business has boomed over the past three years. And now Ziolkowski has his sights on a world in which anyone adding tokens to their crypto wallet can opt in for insurance, much as travelers can buy coverage when they purchase a flight.  Relm is by no means the only insurer working in this space. Its competitors include Chainproof, a spin-off of smart contract developer shop Quantstamp that recently obtained a Bermuda license. Chainproof, which bills itself as the “world’s first regulated smart contract insurer,” charges DeFi depositors a fee based on a percentage of their deposits and pledges to refund the full exposure for any technical failure of the code.  Read more: Why DeFi Insurance Needs a New Design  Other players, such as Nexus Mutual and InsurAce, are decentralized and therefore not regulated per se. Such projects mutualize the risk across token holders and use smart contracts to automate payouts in the event of a breach or failure. Some, such as Cover Protocol, have come and gone because their own smart contracts were attacked and drained of funds.  Security and standards have improved for such insurers, as has the reliability of many of the smart contracts they cover. Still, Chainalysis says October was the worst month on record for crypto attacks: The blockchain analytics firm tallied up over $718 million lost in just the first 13 days. It’s clear that customers are going to need far more assurances that they’re protected if DeFi adoption is to grow.  Here, insurance can play a key role, not only in providing that financial backstop but in incentivizing best practices that protect customers’ funds – much as auto insurer demands have influenced the adoption of many safety features in cars and have encouraged drivers to drive safely.  With the insurance industry’s help, the DeFI industry will eventually figure out how to better manage risk across the entire ecosystem. Innovative insurance hubs such as Bermuda are ideally placed to lead that effort.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | MINING,Michael J.

42413763,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlC0sQ,1666975969,Is Credit Suisse a Canary in the Financial Industry Coal Mine?,"Credit Suisse on Thursday released a restructuring plan in an effort to push back against a narrative recently dominated by huge losses and bizarre scandals. Investors were deeply unimpressed, sending Suisse stock tumbling more than 15% after an earnings report that also included big losses, and a fundraising plan that would massively dilute current shareholders.  Elements of the plan seem significant not just for the struggling bank, but for the financial industry overall. Suisse wants to get much smaller, reducing headcount by roughly one-fifth. According to multiple reports, it wants to spin off some of its investment banking and advisory business to form a company called Credit Suisse First Boston – or, rather, to re-form it.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Credit Suisse’s dramatic flubs in recent years are dominating discussion of the new tack, and fair enough: The bank’s embarrassing losses on borderline frauds like Archegos and Greensill invite very pointed questions about whether the bank has the talent and discipline needed to handle high finance.  But Suisse’s repeated self-inflicted wounds may also be the product of broader structural factors, maybe including the limits of the high finance market as a whole.  Suisse was among the European banks that decided, starting mostly in the 1990s, to try to compete with Wall Street in corporate dealmaking. For both Suisse and the equally notorious Deutsche Bank, this strategic shift has arguably been a decades-long boondoggle.  Deutsche beat its own retreat in 2019, proactively shrinking its investment banking operations after, quite simply, failing to make money at it. UBS did something similar way back in 2012, though under quite different conditions. Notably, UBS planned 10,000 layoffs in its investment banking pullback, very close to Credit Suisse’s planned 9,000 cuts.  For Credit Suisse, the spin-off of First Boston would certainly represent a poetic admission of defeat. The relationship between Suisse and First Boston started in 1978, leading to a merger in 1988 and the retirement of the “Credit Suisse First Boston” brand in 2005.  See also: Bitcoiners Were Right: Weaponized Finance Just Created a Post-Dollar Planet | Opinion  But despite that bold symbolic move, Credit Suisse never made sustained headway in taking finance business away from Wall Street titans including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. Suisse’s market cap peaked in 2007. Despite being relatively well-positioned going into the global financial crisis, it basically failed to capitalize on the decade-long expansion that followed.  Now, Suisse’s road map suggests a greater strategic focus on wealth management for rich individuals. That’s still a potentially lucrative market but it offers nothing like the opportunity of investment banking.  When the pie stops growing  One way to interpret the recent retreats by Deutsche Bank and Suisse is that there simply isn’t enough demand for investment banking to support every entity that would love to be collecting investment banking-size fees. That’s not obvious from a high level because the sector has continued to grow, but a recent Deloitte report identified significant structural headwinds – including potential competition from blockchains and other lower-friction digital finance technologies.  Really seeing the deeper limits of high finance, though, requires attention to the relationship between speculation and crisis. Entities like Suisse and Deutsche that try to “break in” to mergers advisory and the like will tend to engage in riskier deals, even at similar levels of competence, leading almost inevitably to blowups like those of hedge fund Archegos and financial services firm Greensill.  What really boggles the mind, though, is thinking about how many near-misses this implies: deals that maybe should never have happened, but which expansion-hungry banks made anyway. Even if these edge deals didn’t make much money, they would have been counted toward “growth” in finance as long as they didn’t blow up quite as badly as an Archegos.  Even more significantly, most mergers and other deals that earn fees for banks end up having neutral or negative impacts for shareholder value and in the real economy.  See also: Why DeFi Might Be Safer Than Traditional Finance | Opinion  Put differently, it seems likely that the growth in finance in recent decades was driven by the supply side – money looking for deals to do, rather than deals that actually needed to get done. Some of the itchiest suppliers are finally taking their chips and going home, which in this framing could have some stabilizing effect on the macroeconomy and mute the kind of boom-bust cycles that have begun to feel endemic.  That might be wishful thinking – the world remains awash in capital seeking returns, so who’s to say if unproductive deals will actually be damped by the decline of a couple of spectacularly bumbling intermediaries?

42413945,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAnTp2,1666972927,From Hairstylist to Crypto Trader: A Cautionary Tale,"Silvia never worked a day on Wall Street. She was a hairstylist to rock stars.  She doesn’t have an MBA but she appeared in the credits of GQ.  She never sat on a bank's proprietary trading desk. She sat behind the velvet ropes in the VIP section of clubs you won’t ever get into.  She was never a professional portfolio manager. She traded crypto on her phone from exotic beaches all over the world and was so good at it, her balances at one point would shame a baby banker.  Then crypto winter came, and Silvia’s wealth disappeared.  She found herself in Puerto Rico, having chased the dream of a crypto utopia but now faced with the reality of having to start all over again. Her story is a cautionary tale of how fortunes can be won and lost thanks to how easy it is for a new breed of retail traders to take on levered positions in the wild markets of crypto.  How did she get to this point?  In the early aughts, Silvia (CoinDesk is withholding her last name for privacy) was a glamorous young stylist, living a colorful life in New York City’s East Village. Married at 21 to a photographer, her life and work intermingled. She wasn’t just working with artists, she was very much part of the arts scene and the fabled nightlife that went with it back then.  When musicians needed to a cutting-edge look for their promo pictures, it was Silvia’s haircuts they wanted. Over the years her scissors have cut the hair of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Jack Antonoff and King Princess. When high fashion magazines – Vogue, I-D, Vanity Fair, GQ Style UK, Interview and The New York Times Magazine, to name a few – did editorial shoots, Silvia was often their go-to person for hair.  Love versus bitcoin  A few years later, long after her marriage ended, Silvia dated a coder. It was 2015.  “He was interesting, he was smart and he was moody,” Silvia reminisced. “One day he was brooding around the house telling me that he had some serious regrets about not investing in bitcoin several years earlier. I'm very optimistic and I always see the bright side of things. So I just said, ‘Well, what makes you think you missed the boat? Maybe the boat hasn't even sailed yet.’”  That’s when Silvia opened a Coinbase account and bought a single bitcoin for less than $1,000.  The volatility was too much for Silvia’s boyfriend. “He told me to sell,” she said. “I sold at a loss, which really bummed me out.”  Shortly after, Silvia made a decision.  “I had to break up with him. What choice did I have? What I mean, come on, when you're not on the same page as a couple,] we all know where this is going. If he wasn't on the same page with crypto as I was, it was doomed for failure. So I kept investing. I moved on. I never looked back.”  Seacoast sunshine and crypto winters  By the end of 2016, bitcoin was on a tear. “I felt for the first time the euphoria of a crypto rally,” Silvia said. “It was so exciting. I decided to get an apartment in California.”  Then the crash of 2017-2018 happened and she was paying hefty rents on two apartments, one in downtown Los Angeles, the other in Manhattan. Yet not only did she keep her apartments, she held on to her crypto, never selling.  That turned out to be a winning strategy and by 2019, Silvia, ever the free spirit, was on the move again. This time running off for a few months to her ancestral hometown of Lipari, off the coast of Sicily. Toward the middle of the year, as bitcoin neared $13,000, Silvia returned to New York.  COVID-19 struck less than a year later.  “After that, I started paying attention to the prices because they were jumping around, it seemed like another exciting time was happening,” said Silvia. “Then I went in all the way headfirst.”  The technical trader  As bitcoin bounced from its March 12, 2020, bottom, Silvia dedicated her time to learning about trading crypto.  “I was trying to educate myself. I was learning how to set up bots. I was watching a lot of YouTube. I was on a couple of Discords. It seemed like there was a lot of enthusiasm at that point.”  She followed the gossip. She also learned technical analysis.  “I had a couple of courses that I was following,” Silvia said. “I was looking at volume indicators, RSI, things like that.” (She means the relative strength index, a technical indicator, not repetitive stress injury.)  “I can't say I was an expert, so let's be real here,” she added modestly. Nonetheless, she quickly became wary of advice from online technical analysts. “Whenever someone's talking with a lot of conviction, that's how you know it's probably going to go the other way.”  It wasn’t just the charts Silvia studied. She began reading up on projects such as Solana, Avalanche and, fatefully, Luna. Things were going so well that she bought a one-way ticket to Mexico.  “I didn't even bring my computer,” she said. “And good things happened. I was swing trading. I did very well.”  The San Juan crypto dream  Beach life in Mexico wasn’t enough to keep Silvia from being homesick. Four months later she flew north to spend time with her parents in New Jersey. It was June 2021 and one of her sisters, a forensic accountant, had an idea.  “She suggested after all of my adventures and crypto trading through my phone and traveling through Mexico, that I go to Puerto Rico, because there was a big community there that was doing this as well,” Silvia recounts. “So I got on an airplane the next day and I went to Puerto Rico for six days. I met a lot of really interesting people. I met a really nice Colombian girl on the beach, who was very gung-ho about me moving there so we could hang out. She ended up being my friend. She helped me move. She took me around to all the stores to get things from my new apartment, which was right on the beach.”  What Silvia found in San Juan was a city that combined crypto with fun. She described it as “paradise” where everyone seemed to be talking about crypto.  “It's exciting, when things are going great – everybody's happy,” said Silvia. “There are kite-surfing classes happening on the beach and crypto business meetings also happening right on the beach. There are lots of meetups. There are lots of conventions that happen at beach clubs.”  Puerto Rico’s capital city was teeming with crypto enthusiasts of all stripes.  “There's a whole cast of characters down there that are really awesome,” she said, including New Age-y “crypto wizards” who trade based on phases of the moon. “There was actually a full moon party in front of my little apartment every month. …There's full moon parties. There's drum circles. There's recreational marijuana. Lots of Medalla beer.”  There were other types of moon worshipers, though, many of whom were in their 20s. “I actually met a lot of really enthusiastic young people who were super bullish on luna and I think about them all the time because I don't know what happened to them … Poor kids.”  As many readers know, luna was the “staking token” for the Terra protocol, backing an algorithmic stablecoin called UST. In May, the luna token could not keep UST in line with the U.S. dollar, the fiat currency it was supposed to mimic. The subsequent $60 billion collapse led to a meltdown of the crypto market.  Older folks as well could be found trading crypto in San Juan.  “Lots of retired people who had just discovered crypto who were DCAing [dollar cost averaging] at the height of the rally – probably losing their mind right now,” she quickly added as an aside. “There was a lot of people leaving everything they knew behind to move to Puerto Rico … a lot of people even ended up moving there with spouses and then things don't work out.”  Leverage and a falling market  Coinciding with the fantasy life on the beaches of San Juan were the fantastic gains Silvia was achieving trading crypto. Documents reviewed by CoinDesk showed stunning, quadruple-digit returns and breathtaking balances over a short period of time. At her request, we are not publishing screenshots nor revealing the precise amounts but suffice it to say, the unrealized gains were impressive – several Lamborghinis worth, by our math.  Like many other retail crypto traders, Silvia began dabbling with leverage trading and options after hearing about them from other traders. These strategies worked until they didn’t.  “I was really out of my comfort zone,” Silvia recalled.  She then learned the hard way the dangers of leverage when the market goes against a position. Luna spectacularly imploded, wiping away tens of billions of dollars in value from the market. Silvia’s unrealized fortune disappeared, as did those of many others trading alongside her in Puerto Rico. The mood shift was palpable.  “You could just tell that the morale had changed,” she said. “ There was an era of sadness.”  Silvia and others were crushed. “Lots of sleepless nights,” she remembered. “I heard of a man losing nearly $80 million in luna, of all things.”  Exodus from crypto paradise but not crypto  Earlier in September, Silvia finally got her things out of her place in San Juan and returned to the New York area. She has the tools of her trade – a collection of scissors, combs, hair dryers and makeup – that paid for the initial capital she used to invest in crypto.  Looking back, she marveled at her story. Being a woman day trader made her stand out in the male-dominated crypto markets, but so did her life story.  “I think I am a little bit of an unusual story,” she reflected. “I don't think there's that many artists who were involved in crypto from an early stage, who can say they packed their bags and moved to a crypto Mecca.”  Silvia is still HODLing bitcoin and is optimistic on ether. “That’s my jam.”  “I’m going to be in crypto forever. I’m not getting out. Let’s be real. I’m a true believer.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | LUNA | MARKET | TRADING,Lawrence Lewitinn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/10/28/from-hair-stylist-to-crypto-trader-a-cautionary-tale,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d6ac3c243af63805c906eaa425396b683ce1c8da-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Appearing at Lugano’s Plan B Forum on Friday, Milena Mayorga, El Salvador’s ambassador to the U.S., also announced her country’s opening of a “bitcoin office” in Lugano staffed with a new Honorary Consul to proselytize for bitcoin in the city, Italy and Europe.

The Arca Digital Assets Fund, which invests in the tokens of crypto companies, had raised $191.7 million as of Oct. 24, up from $109 million at the beginning of October 2021, the firm said in a filing this week with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The number of investors in the fund, which is still open to new investors, increased from 333 to 576 between the filings.  The type of SEC filing Arca used typically includes the amount of money investors have given the fund – or sales – though some companies instead provide the fund’s assets under management, which would reflect performance. According to Arca’s Investment Adviser registration documents, the Arca Digital Assets Fund had a $234.3 million gross asset value as of June 30.  In an investor letter sent out in May, Arca revealed exposure to Terra’s native token LUNA and its stablecoin terraUSD (UST). The algorithmic stablecoin lost its peg to the dollar in a dramatic collapse, taking LUNA with it. Arca said Digital Assets held LUNA at the time of the letter, which still predicted a recovery for the Terra tokens.  Arca manages three other funds built off the framework of the Digital Assets vehicle, according to the firm’s website: The actively managed Arca Digital Yield that had Terra’s UST as a core holding, early-stage venture capital-focused Arca Endeavor and Arca NFT for non-fungible token exposure. The funds had gross asset values of $53 million, $10 million and $24.4 million at the end of June, respectively.  Arca declined to comment on this article when contacted by CoinDesk.

42411713,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfK9r,1666970824,Crypto Market Financial Terms You Should Know,"This glossary covers the terminologies and jargon you need to understand or you'll hear as traders and investors discuss the cryptocurrency market. It's important to know the key terms so you can understand the strategies and decisions being discussed.  Want to learn more? Sign up for CoinDesk’s Learn Crypto Investing Course.  Crypto Market Glossary  Accumulation phase: This is a period of consolidation where prices are trading within a narrow range, usually following a bear market or a downtrend in prices and investors see an opportunity to buy or accumulate assets at a low price. The significance of an accumulation is that it usually precedes a start of an uptrend in prices or a bull market.  Altcoin: An altcoin is any cryptocurrency that is created as an alternative to bitcoin. Altcoins may be created to improve upon the original design of the Bitcoin network or to pursue an entirely different model.  Bagholder: A bagholder is someone who holds a coin that has lost value and is now worth less than what he paid for it, or nothing at all. Bagholders typically buy toward the peak of a crypto’s value and end up holding nothing but an empty bag.  Bearish: A bearish market is one where prices are falling.  Bullish: A bullish market is one where prices are rising.  Bear market: A bear market is a prolonged period of decline in the prices of assets. Bear markets are typically associated with a high level of market uncertainty and pessimism.  Bearish flag: This is a technical pattern found on a chart that looks like an upside-down flag with a pole. After a period of bearish price action, this pattern signifies a potential additional bearish price drop.  Bubble: A hyper increase of price fueled by speculation and hype for a certain market or asset. It is often associated with all the assets within the market being overvalued and anticipation that the price could crash or the bubble will burst.  Bull market: A bull market is a prolonged period of growth in the prices of assets. Bull markets are typically associated with high market optimism and confidence.  Bullish reversal: After a period of price decrease or a period of consolidation either below the 50-day moving average or the 200-day moving average, this becomes a start of a new bullish trend.  Capitulation: This occurs during a downtrend or a bear market where the price of an asset is falling and the asset encounters a massive surge of selling pressure.  Correction: A correction is when the price of the crypto market or a digital asset drops 10% or more from its peak over a period of days, weeks or months.  Crypto crash:A crash is a sudden and sharp decline in the prices of assets, usually 10% or more within a day. Crypto crashes are typically associated with high market uncertainty and fear.  Dead cat bounce: A dead cat bounce is a small and temporary price rebound after a significant decline.  Death cross: A technical pattern found on charts where the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average signifying a potential continuation of a bearish trend.  Diamond hands: A slang term popular on Reddit and Twitter for those who hold on to volatile stocks or crypto despite high volatility or falling prices, because they believe in the long-term value of the asset.  FOMO: FOMO is an acronym for “fear of missing out.” FOMO is the feeling of anxiety or excitement that comes from thinking you might miss out on a good opportunity and feeling pressure to get in on it. This can lead to buying a digital asset at its peak price before a massive drop.  FUD: Fear, uncertainty and doubt. FUD is often used to describe negative sentiment in the market.  Golden cross: A technical pattern found on charts where the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average, signifying a potential continuation of a bullish trend.  Liquidation: When a business decides to cease operations, it sells its assets to pay off lenders and creditors. Investors can also liquidate their holdings to raise cash, exit a weak position or for other reasons.  Liquidity: The ease with which a cryptocurrency can be swapped with another digital asset or fiat currency. Assets with good liquidity have a good volume of buyers and sellers.  Margin call: This occurs when the portfolio value of the owner’s account falls below the required threshold of the broker’s required limit. This would force you to add more money into your account by either depositing more or selling current assets.  Market capitalization: In crypto, the market cap is the total value of all the coins or tokens circulating in the market.  Moving average: One of the most common technical indicators found on a chart is a line signifying the average change of price over a specific time frame such as daily, four hours, weekly, etc. It allows investors to see the general trend by smoothing out the spikes and dips in prices. Common moving averages are the 50-day moving average and the 200-day moving average.  Oversold: This term is used to indicate the price of an asset as being too low or undervalued as shown by a technical indicator such as the relative strength index (RSI) or stochastics, signifying a potential bullish reversal in price.  Pump and dump: This is a type of market manipulation where a group of investors artificially inflate the price of an asset by buying it in large quantities or hyping it through social media, or both, and then “dumps” it on the market for a profit.  Rising wedge: This is a technical pattern found on a chart that signifies a potential bearish breakdown in price action. This is usually used in combination with technical indicators such as RSI or money flow indicator (MFI) to measure the likelihood of rapid price decrease in terms of overbought state or bearish divergence.  Risk on/risk off: The risk-on risk-off theory states when the market or economy is in good shape, investors are more prone to buying riskier investments such as crypto or stocks. When the market or economy is bad, investors prefer safe-haven assets such as bonds or staying with cash on the sidelines.  Sell-off: Just like it sounds, this happens when people are rapidly selling a specific asset, causing the price to drop quickly with high volume. It can happen during a crash or because of bad economic news.  Short selling: Short selling is a type of trading where you sell an asset you don't own and hope to repurchase it later at a lower price so that you can profit from the price difference.  Trade: A trade is a transaction in which you exchange one asset for another. A trade's purpose is to profit from the price difference between the two assets.  V-shape recovery: This is a technical chart pattern in which prices of an asset or market dramatically plunge only to rebound very quickly, creating a V pattern on a chart.  Volatility: Volatility is a measure of how much the price of an asset fluctuates. A volatile asset is one that has significant and sudden price swings.  Whale: A whale is an investor with a large amount of capital. Whales can have a significant impact on the market price of an asset by buying or selling large quantities.  Whipsaw: When the market is neither bullish nor bearish, there are periods where the price of the market or asset is trapped in a range where the price goes up and down quickly for a prolonged period of time.  Yield or percent return is how much income is generated from the principal amount of your investment. Let’s say you bought one bitcoin at $10,000, and its current price is $19,000. The yield is 90%.

42394166,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXtK5,1666970351,Why Crypto Needs UCC Article 12,"Am I at risk of a lawsuit if I buy a token from someone who received it from a hacker?  How do I know if there’s a lien or claim on my bitcoin?  What rights do I have if I loaned out my ether and the borrower has defaulted on the loan or even filed for bankruptcy protection?  These questions have haunted the crypto industry since its beginning. Although law and regulation have been quick to embrace digital assets, many private law questions remain unanswered. These include the title to digital assets or the extent of legal rights received with the transfer of a digital asset, whether and how a security interest can be perfected in digital assets, and the priority for security interests against digital assets. For many of these issues, U.S. law looks to Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC).  Andrew Hinkes is a partner at K&L Gates, co-chair of its Digital Assets, Blockchain Technology and Cryptocurrencies practice, and an adjunct professor at NYU Law and the New York University Stern School of Business. Hinkes was an adviser to the Digital Assets Working Group, which drafted Article 12 and the conforming amendments.  The UCC streamlines rules for common commercial transactions like secured lending and transfers of certain assets by providing defaults and gap fillers to simplify commercial law and encourage parties to enter into agreements, and imposes certain mandatory rules. After three years of study, debate and drafting, the 2022 Amendments to the Uniform Commercial Code incorporate the newly created Article 12 of the UCC which adapts existing law to digital assets. Why does this matter for crypto? Many nagging questions will be resolved if the 2022 UCC Amendments are adopted uniformly by all 50 states. For example:  How does proposed UCC Article 12 apply to my digital assets?  UCC Article 12 creates a new category of asset called a Controllable Electronic Record (CER), which builds on existing UCC provisions and applies that law to those in control, rather than in possession, of CERs. Existing law that addresses the perfection of security interests relies upon either the filing of financing statements or the concept of possession, which generally requires physical possession. (A perfected security interest is a secure interest in an asset that cannot be claimed by another party.)  Digital assets like ether and non-fungible tokens (NFT) are intangible and cannot be possessed as the law understands it. Rather than rely on physical possession, the CER definition uses “control.” Control is determined using a functional test that requires more than mere private key control, and focuses on the power to enjoy substantially all of the benefits of the asset and to prevent others from enjoying substantially all of the benefits of the asset, and the ability to transfer the asset to third parties.  See also: Crypto and the 'Law of the Horse'  Most common cryptocurrencies, tokens, stablecoins and NFTs are probably CERs, given that a person can enjoy substantially all their benefits while concurrently excluding all others from interfering with their enjoyment.  Are my coins ‘dirty’?  “Clean” or “virgin” coins that have not circulated after being mined have been touted as more desirable than coins that have circulated; this is because the clean coins would, hypothetically, be free of regulatory or legal claims that may attach to those assets as they are transacted. As the argument goes, coins that have been taken in a hack or pledged as security but then transacted to a third party may carry a claim with them that would apply to the current holder.  Under the current state of the law, it is not clear whether (a) any digital asset has any claim associated with it or (b) whether any claim that applies to the digital asset would continue to apply to the asset after it is transferred to another person. Article 12 would clarify when a transferee takes an asset “subject to” prior claims, and under what circumstances a transferee may “take free” of claims.  A person who receives an asset in good faith, who gives value in return, and who has no notice of a competing claim would take the asset free of any other claim. Thus, Article 12 would increase the negotiability of CERs by treating them similar to other negotiable instruments like checks and promissory notes.  Do I have a security interest in digital asset collateral?  Although many loans are intentionally unsecured, meaning that the lender has no right to proceed against collateral in case of a default, in other cases a borrower may intend to grant to the lender a legally enforceable security interest in digital assets offered as collateral. Before Article 12 it was difficult to perfect a security interest in those digital assets and for the security interest to achieve priority over competing interests.  See also: Will Global Regulations Stifle the Crypto Industry or Encourage New Users? | Opinion  By including CERs the new law would clarify that perfection may be accomplished either by filing (i.e., filing a UCC-1 financing statement in the relevant state’s filing office) or by control of the actual CER, and would give super-priority to those who perfect by control over those with earlier-filed financing statements. Until Article 12 of the UCC is enacted by all states we will have to deal with a confusing situation where different rules may apply more or less arbitrarily depending on factors such as the location of the debtor.  While the updates to the UCC address the certainty of commercial transactions involving crypto, the UCC does not address other substantive law that might affect these assets; look elsewhere for clarity as to securities and commodity regulation, intellectual property, tax, sanctions, anti-money laundering or the rights of digital exchange customers. Article 12 creates defaults and gap fillers, so parties can transact under a common set of rules without having to negotiate complex agreements in the course of their transactions.  It’s time for the crypto industry to have certainty around collateralized lending and certainty as to the legal meaning of transactions of digital assets. The crypto industry should support the adoption of Article 12 of the UCC.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Andrew Hinkes,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/10/28/why-crypto-needs-ucc-article-12,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/61f00f62daa39af22f8e37e1332d09152052d9ff-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394131,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXspJ,1666963335,Web3 Has Failed the Creator Economy,"You’ve probably heard of the creator economy – it’s been quite the buzz about town. It’s estimated to be worth around $100 billion, according to Forbes. At least it was.  Now some of that bright shiny lustre is fading with investment in the space down around 60% from the highs of 2021. Then again, wasn’t everything just mad in 2021? It seems bewildering to think today, but there was a thing called the coronavirus pandemic and everyone was stuck indoors, bored out of their brains and desperate to find alternative ways of earning a living.  Robin Schmidt recently left The Defiant, where he led its multimedia team, to build the metaverse brand BasedAF. This article is part of CoinDesk's ""Trading Week.""  This precipitated an unprecedented rise in the number of people just creating, for themselves or entrepreneurially. On the Web3 side of the world, non-fungible tokens (NFT) captured the imagination with their promise of royalties in perpetuity and an audience ready to speculate on literally anything. Hello to you, Mr. Kevin.  The creator economy is something of a two-headed beast featuring the eponymous creators on one side, gamely fighting the evil platforms and their pesky algorithms alongside a slew of service providers like Karat, Stir and Fourthwall specifically designed to cater to the very specific specifics of being a creator.  I’ve been a kind of pseudo-creator for the last two years in my time at The Defiant, bending crypto stories to my will and refusing to back away from a weak punchline in the service of entertaining the audience while teaching them some stuff, too. I was blessed not to have to rely on the success of that content to pay the bills. Because that is where things really hurt for creators.  It’s another two-headed beast. Build an audience. Monetize that audience. In other words, get known and then sell stuff. It can really mangle your head chasing that sweet clout cocaine. Which is why I’m happy we never really did it at The Defiant.  But now I’m forging a new path on my own as BasedAF and I will be at the mercy of the social media algorithm. My audience must be large and my monetization must be monstrous, otherwise I will be a failure.  You’ll notice that I haven’t mentioned Web3 yet. And that’s because I don’t think this space has done a very good job at creating value for creators. Let me be clear, YouTube, et al., are definitely not perfect, but the toob in particular has done an unreal job of onboarding successive generations of new talent and allowing it to thrive.  No Web3 platform has come close to enabling people to create like Google has. At least not yet. I’ve seen innumerable platforms lamenting the control the inscrutable algorithm has over creators and claiming to return power back to them. But that’s assuming creators want that power. I’d wager the vast majority don’t, and that’s why so many Web3 media projects have failed.  Then there’s the “just add a token” model. ‘Scuse me while I reach for the sick bag. Why would you voluntarily put the success of your brand in the hands of traders? The value you create should reside in the brand, not in an empty token you just issued because it’s cheap and easy to do that rather than creating anything substantive.  More from Trading Week: A Day in the Life of a Crypto Trader  Tokens cannot create sustainable value when their fortunes are as much at the mercy of bitcoin’s volatility as they are in your own talent. Using a token for a longterm create endeavor is idiotic.  However, looking at the models of big YouTubers and the general “creator industry” chatter, everything is geared towards enabling creators to be better business people and maximize profit. It’s somewhat off-putting, and all but ensures the audience gets a bad deal. OK, this is an exaggeration.  There are tons of great courses out there run by creators and maybe I do want to own a hoodie or a T-shirt but the narrative is increasingly leaning towards ""This creator made $100k in a single day selling courses"" with everything geared towards extracting maximum value from your audience which is exactly the gripe gamers had about AAA publishers adding NFTs to their titles.  This is why my mental map of being a Creator has gone full Cerberus, adding a third head to the beast.  Build an audience  Monetize that audience  Share the spoils  And now you’re wondering how on Earth you share the spoils while doing the Texas two-step around the Howey test and without adding a useless token. It turns out you can, and it revolves around porting the idea of yield farming back into Web2. Like, really. Social platforms are a lot like exchanges. They thrive on volume. And that volume creates a yield. So if your content is good then you will generate yield. And the best thing is, that yield is legit. It’s ... whisper it … real yield.  This entails giving an audience ownership of your success from the get-go but with real yield and not Ponzinomic BS. Thing is … this only works at scale, like big, big scale. Our big challenge here at BasedAF is to create content that a lot of people want to consume. Then it might just actually work.  We’re channeling this through, what else, our own PFP (profile pic) collection, that represents and is sold to what we hope will become our SuperFans. Back in November of last year, Blake Robbins wrote a Twitter thread with a line that has refused to shake out of my brain cavity: “In the future, people can be: Full-Time Fans.”  I don’t know if we’ve cracked that but we’re baking that concept of fandom into the project. Because we can. And if we succeed then others will follow because of that third pillar. Honestly, that’s the juiciest, richest one of the three. This is where I think Web3 has a genuine role to play. Disrupting YouTube … not so much.  So one last thought on royalties on non-fungible tokens (NFT) because it’s a hot topic and also a source of monetization for many projects. If royalties are by default dead, then you can’t fight it. But there are options. One is to be your own market maker on Sudoswap. Set up a buy/sell pool and take the swap fees. We’re considering this as a launch strategy for BasedAF. But there’s another idea – the paid reveal. Sell a token for, let’s say, 1.2 ETH but discount it by 50%. This gets you the token but only the token. If you want to reveal the artwork and gain access to the full range of perks or utility offered by a project then you have to pay the balance.  Traders can flip to their hearts content while those who want to go further can opt to reveal. If the token is sold or moved to another wallet it reverts back to its unrevealed state. Separate the trading from the cultural component and allow both sides to play the game they way they want to.

While that may not seem like much, Ardoino said the aim is to bring adoption along in a “scientific way.”  It’s one thing – as many politicians have done – for an official to say he or she is pro-bitcoin, noted Ardoino, but it's another thing to put a plan together.  To that end, Ardoino said that rather than trying to achieve widespread use quickly, it was more important that things worked smoothly for the initial adopters. He now expects 1,000 Lugano merchants will be able to accept bitcoin as a form of payment in the first quarter of 2023.  Ardoino and Foletti said that in addition to adoption, there are two other prongs to Lugano’s Plan B – education and this week’s forum. On the education front, the Plan B Summer School at Lugano’s Franklin University was well attended in July. And the Plan B Forum also appears to be well attended, with Foletti and Ardoino saying they expect it to become an annual event.

42413764,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlC0tM,1666962889,Novel Trading Opportunities in DeFi for TradFi,"Crypto is a $900 billion global market that institutional investors are sizing up.  Despite the inherent risks involved in participating in any nascent sphere, institutional financial players are going out of their way to discover how they can get involved in crypto. This includes telecom giants staking their coins and venture capital funds providing liquidity to decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.  Tongtong Gong is the co-founder and COO at data infrastructure and analytics platform Amberdata. You can follow her on Twitter: @Gongt2. This piece is part of CoinDesk's Trading Week.  This is to say nothing of the new forms of programmatic trading, including crypto derivatives and arbitrage opportunities, used by retail and institutional traders alike.  There are novel opportunities for generating value in DeFi that are not feasible in TradFi. Research estimates that institutional DeFi could reach $1 trillion by 2025. By that point, we might not be separating TradFi and DeFi. It will all simply be Finance.  Read more from Trading Week: 4 Questions That Will Determine the Future of Retail Trading  The novel opportunities in DeFi  The hardest barrier for traditional financial institutions to overcome to get involved in DeFi is understanding that the coded economics of each protocol rely on the laws of supply and demand, and so DeFi assets have a market price. And anywhere there’s trading, there’s a way to make money.  The current crop of crypto and DeFi platforms offer a few ways – familiar and unfamiliar to TradFi brokers – of making money.  Now that Ethereum has officially transitioned from the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus standard to proof-of-stake (PoS), ETH staking has become one of the easiest ways for institutional capital to come into the market. A JPMorgan report from this summer estimated the crypto staking industry could reach $40 billion by 2025.  Staking is the process by which a user locks up a portion of their assets for a length of time to help support the functions of the network. For doing so, they receive rewards in the form of additional assets.  Right now, however, the majority of validator rewards are going to people, firms and projects that have mastered the art of maximal extractable value (MEV). This is the process of using behind-the-scenes strategies to earn the greatest possible amount in fees from all the transactions that a validator will group into a block to be added to the chain.  Anyone or anything can be a so-called “block builder,” and practice MEV. In fact, deploying software created by Flashbots called MEV Boost makes it trivially easy to earn returns and is used by a majority of Ethereum validators. According to data provider Pintail, validators are generating a median return of 6.1% APR using Flashbot’s software.  Institutional financial players can also become liquidity providers (LPs) to decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and lending protocols. Most DEXs use the automated market maker (AMM) model of pricing tokens, so buyers and sellers always have a platform to transact.  LPs are incentivized to add tokens to AMM pools of each side of a token pair, and receive a percentage of transaction fees as a reward. This same system can also be applied to lending pools where LPs earn a percentage of interest by locking up liquidity for borrowers. Given the key role of liquidity in markets, protocols often incentivize network use by providing substantial yields.  Read more from Trading Week: 'A Metric for Fun': The FTX Leaderboard  While many of these trading strategies might seem strange to institutions not fully familiar with DeFi, there are still more familiar methods of making money: like traditional trading and arbitrager.  DEXs also enable many new forms of programmatic trading, including crypto derivatives and arbitrage opportunities. Just as in TradFi, crypto derivatives can take the form of futures, options and perpetual contracts but the value is derived from digital assets rather than stocks.  Arbitrage opportunities arise when the price of a token on one DEX is less than the price on other DEXs or centralized exchanges (CEXs). By relying on high-quality real-time data, institutional traders can quickly identify those opportunities to buy the asset where it is listed low and sell it on DEXs with higher listings.  Risks and challenges  Providing liquidity is simple, but it isn’t risk free. For example, it’s important to understand the concept of impermanent loss, which describes the ""unrealized opportunity"" on a DEX or DeFi platform when the token price changes relative to when it was deposited or withdrawn.  For example, let's say an LP deposits liquidity into an ETH-BTC pool at a time when 1 BTC equals 10 ETH. A month later, the value of ETH doubled while BTC hasn't changed. When this disparity occurs, arbitrage traders will jump at the opportunity to buy ETH from that pool and sell it on a DEX at a higher price thereby bringing the pool ratio and token prices back to market rate. This could hurt a depositor or benefit them, depending on which side of the trade they’re on.  Read more from Trading Week: Why Trading Is Essential for Crypto  (That said, during this period of high demand for ETH, transaction fees increase and so LPs may make up the impermanent loss through fees with enough exposure.)  Institutional traders are likely to know already that there’s no such thing as a free lunch.

""Among other reasons, the company’s accounting and financial records have not been properly maintained,"" the interim judicial managers (IJM) said in their first report to the court and the company's creditors. In addition, some company directors and other employees are preventing access to ""various key books and records.""  Hodlnaut directors came under fire for downplaying the extent of the firm's exposure to TerraUSD (UST) during the $60 billion collapse of the Terra ecosystem. The firm converted a ""significant amount"" of crypto into UST, much of which was staked on the now defunct Anchor Protocol to generate a yield. Directors of Hodlnaut HK, a subsidiary of Hodlnaut, said that the loss sustained equates to $189.7 million.  Terra’s implosion led to widespread contagion and a subsequent downturn across the crypto market, with several firms, including prominent hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, filing for bankruptcy alongside crypto lenders Celsius Network and Voyager Digital.  A review of transaction data by the judicial managers shows that Hodlnaut employees withdrew a total of $550,000 between the beginning of July and the time the firm froze withdrawals for customers.  According to figures in the report, Hodlaut total estimated asset's equate to $74 million with liabilities of $267.6 million, a shortfall of $193.6 million. Almost three-quarters of Hodlnaut's assets are in decentralized finance (DeFi) positions across Compound, Convex and Aave.  The IJMs plan to consolidate all assets from centralized exchanges to a custodial wallet. They will also conduct further reviews of Hodlnaut directors to see if any additional claims can be pursued by creditors.  The next report will be published on Dec. 15.  UPDATE (Oct. 28, 13:48 UTC): Adds Hodlnaut's UST exposure, employee withdrawals and financial situation.  UPDATE (Oct. 28, 15:00 UTC): Changes headline, adds context throughout.

WisdomTree held $265 million in cryptocurrencies at the end of the second quarter, but the assets depreciated by $87 million during the third quarter with the market downturn.

The PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) Price Index increased 0.3% in September, slowing from August's 0.4% clip. The increase was also less than the 0.4% average estimate of economists in a FactSet survey.  The price of bitcoin (BTC) jumped after the news, and was up to about $20,500, from about $20,100 just before the report.  Bitcoin, along with U.S. stocks and other assets seen as risky, has been moving recently on speculation over whether the Fed might soon let up in its campaign to bring down soaring inflation. The central bank has been tightening monetary policy to cool the economy in an effort to slow the pace of consumer-price rises – and higher interest rates tend to make risky assets less attractive.  Over the past 12 months, the PCE Index is up 6.2% – still well above the Fed's 2% target. The measure is produced by the U.S. Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis.  But traders might be encouraged by any signs of progress in bringing the number down, even incrementally.  Another inflation gauge, the Consumer Price Index, produced by the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, is typically published a couple weeks prior to PCE every month and is much more closely watched by economists and the broader public.  The most recent CPI report, published Oct. 13, showed that the index unexpectedly rose faster than expected in September, at a rate of 8.2%, close to its highest level in four decades.

In a notice to users, Huobi, the top trading venue for the $219 million market-cap stablecoin, cited its rules for performing “regular inspection” on listed assets. In August, the stablecoin briefly lost its dollar peg and crashed 8% after its issuer closed “several accounts” because of regulatory concerns.  The stablecoin HUSD was down 8% over the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The price of Huobi token (HT), an ecosystem token launched by Huobi Global, was also down 7% on the day.

42413771,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlC0zu,1666954555,Stablecoin Issuer Frax Finance Unveils Ether Staking Service With a Dual Token Model,"Decentralized stablecoin issuer Frax Finance has entered the ether liquid staking war with a unique two-token model that supposedly allows users to earn above-average staking yields.  Called Frax Ether, the liquid staking system, went live on Oct. 13 in a soft community launch with an official announcement expected soon. The system has three components – frax ether (frxETH), staked frax Ether (sfrxETH) and the Frax ETH Minter. Staking refers to locking up coins in a crypto wallet in return for rewards. Liquid staking is the process of locking up funds to earn rewards while still having access to the funds locked via their liquid derivative coins.  The Frax ether token is an ether-pegged stablecoin meant to be equal to one ether (ETH). Users can deposit ETH into the Frax ETH Minter contract and get an equivalent amount of frxETH, unlocking the liquidity of ether staked. The frxETH tokens can be used to provide liquidity on the decentralized exchange Curve. To earn rewards on the ether staked, however, users need to exchange frxETH with the staked frax ether or sfrxETH tokens.  That's the critical difference between Frax and Lido, a staking tool that owns more than 70% of the liquid staking derivative market. Lido has only one token called staked ether (stETH), which can be used elsewhere to generate additional yield. The stETH is a ""rebasing token"" with supply algorithmically adjusted to keep its price in line with ether's price. In other words, stETH holders earn rewards in the form of new stETH tokens and not in the form of appreciated stETH value.  The problem with stETH is that some decentralized-finance (DeFi) protocols don't support rebasing tokens natively. So stETH holders risk losing out on a portion of daily staking rewards if they provide stETH as liquidity across such platforms. Therefore, stETH holders often have to wrap their liquid derivative tokens, creating a DeFi-compatible version.  Frax Finance's two-token model eliminates risks associated with rebasing and simplifies DeFi integrations. The frxETH stablecoin doesn't rebase and is fully backed by algorithmic market operations plus ether. Further, the sfrxETH tokens, which earn staking rewards, increase in price like the Yearn vault token.  ""Lido has just one token because it rebases to reflect staking rewards. It breaks a lot of DeFi functionality. We don't want that, so we have opted for two tokens that can be used as DeFi primitives,"" Sam Kazemian, founder of Frax Finance, told CoinDesk.  ""If you want an interest-bearing increasing token as like lending collateral, you would use sfrxETH, which is the staked version. If you just want a DeFi primitive, you can use frxETH,"" Kazemian added.  At press time, the total value locked in Frax Ether stood at $3.2 million, according to DefiLlama.  Maximizing yields  According to DeFi observer Shivanshu Madan, Frax's two-token model allows stakers to earn more than the average ether staking yield.  Let's look at a hypothetical example. Assume a trader named Bob deposits 100 ETH in the frxETH minter contract in return for 100 frxETH tokens.  The minter then locks the 100 ETH on Ethereum using a validator node. In the meantime, Bob deposits the 100 frxETH in the staked frax ether vault in return for 100 sfrxETH tokens.  Now assume the validator earns 10 ETH as the staking reward. It will send it back to the minter and get 10 frxETH, which is then sent to the staked frax ether vault, boosting its balance to 110 frxETH (100 deposited by Bob and 10 earned from staking).  In other words, Bob has earned a staking reward of 10 frxETH, which he can collect anytime by returning the 100 sfrxETH to the vault.  Deposit frxETH at different places  In the above example, assume that Bob sends only 60 frxETH to the staked frax ether vault and deposits the remaining 40 frxETH in the frxETH-ETH Curve pool.  In this case, the validator would still earn a yield on the initial deposit of 100 ETH, meaning the frax staked ether vault will hold 70 frxETH (60 deposited by Bob and 10 as rewards) when the rewards come through.  Meanwhile, Bob earns an additional yield, say five frxETH, for providing 40 frxETH on Curve. That takes the total return to 15 frxETH compared with 10 frxETH in the previous example.  The key point here is that return from providing liquidity on Curve needs to be higher than the staking yield.  The user, therefore, will have to find profitable strategies if he or she wants to earn ""more than the average"" staking yield, as Madan warned in a tweet thread.",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/28/frax-finance-unveils-ether-liquid-staking-service-with-a-dual-token-model,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1caddf23da2a71f453f0536d270b1fb3fd14062c-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42413769,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlC0x6,1666952216,Morgan Stanley Says Record Number of Bitcoin Have Not Been Used for 6 Months,"Nearly a year into the “bitcoin bear market,” most investors who bought the cryptocurrency in 2021 are facing heavy losses and look to be waiting for rallies to close their positions, Morgan Stanley (MS) said in a research report Thursday.  Bitcoin (BTC) has traded in the tightest U.S. dollar range since late 2020, despite heightened volatility in other financial markets. This stability “suggests some traders are buying dips below $18,500 to prevent BTC falling materially below its 2017 prior cycle high,” the report said.  A record 78% of bitcoin has not been used in transactions in the last six months, and the level is increasing, according to the report. That implies investors who bought or received bitcoin longer than six months ago are holding on to their positions, with some likely waiting for a recovery in price, analyst Sheena Shah wrote.  Estimates suggest that for the remaining 22% of bitcoin held by shorter-term investors, the average breakeven price is slightly over $22,300, the note said.  The bank says that trading volumes have been falling on most exchanges except Binance, which lowered BTC trading fees to zero in July to grow market share. Bitcoin’s price has been “surprisingly stable” since this change, raising the possibility that the price stabilization was “being supported by traders on Binance taking advantage of zero fees and making short-term purchases.”  Ether (ETH) is now tracking equity markets more than bitcoin, the note said. Due to BTC’s relative stability, some investors may be asking whether Ethereum’s move to proof-of-stake (PoS) “has changed the trading dynamics” for bitcoin, because the Bitcoin blockchain does not limit access to certain market participants in the way that Ethereum now does. The transition, known as the Merge, was the first of five upgrades planned for the Ethereum blockchain and involved the switch to a more energy-efficient consensus mechanism.  Morgan Stanley says institutional demand for crypto depends on price volatility. Traditional finance companies have increasingly been introducing crypto products to meet client demand, but given recent flows in exchange-traded-products (ETP) and volume trends “unless there is material upward price volatility it may be difficult to see that real demand pick up materially,” the note added.

Notably, the Bitcoin price was unimpressed by the news. As NewsBTC reported, a Bitcoin miner capitulation is currently the biggest intra-market risk.

The five funds were all linked to the performance of crypto or blockchain. The worst performer was France-based Melanion BTC Equities Universe fund, which invests in companies such as bitcoin miners Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) and Riot Blockchain (RIOT). The fund, which launched October 2021, has seen its value slide 76.9% in the past 12 months.  Many ETFs started during the heady days of the last crypto bull market, enjoying an initial boom at the end of 2021 before crashing as valuations tanked this year.  Morningstar's data however suggests that a poor first year does not condemn ETFs in the long-term. The SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Growth ETF (SPYG), a non-crypto fund that tracks the S&P 500 Growth Total Return Index, fell by 52.8% in 2000-2001. It has since recovered and is now a $12.2 billion fund, the FT said.

42413757,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlC0ls,1666943761,Cardano Weighs on Crypto Majors After US Tech Stocks Plunge,"Crypto majors slid in the past 24 hours following a plunge in U.S. technology stocks as key companies reported lower-than-expected earnings. Bitcoin has previously followed the movement in technology stocks.  The equities drop came even after an unexpectedly strong gross domestic product report in the U.S., with economic growth expanding 2.6% in the third quarter versus expectations for 2.4% growth, as reported. Tech-focused Nasdaq 100 finished 1.63% lower on Thursday, while the S&P 500 fell 0.61%.  Dogecoin (DOGE) rebounded after losing some 7.7% in 24 hours following a two-day rise as Elon Musk neared his takeover of microblogging service Twitter (TWTR). Musk has been a major supporter of DOGE, which has become a proxy for sentiment about him. The entrepreneur's statements about the token have also consistently influenced its price. The token was trading 5% higher over 24 hours as of 11:00 UTC.  Cardano's ADA led declines in crypto majors, falling almost 6%. Bitcoin (BTC) lost about 2% while ether (ETH) and Solana (SOL) fell 3%. BNB Chain’s BNB token showed nominal losses as crypto exchange Binance – which issued BNB and supports development on the BNB Chain – confirmed its equity investment in Musk’s Twitter.  Crypto-tracked futures racked up just $97 million in liquidations, a lower-than-usual figure that suggested the declines were mostly spot driven.  Weak third-quarter results from Microsoft (MSFT) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) weighed on U.S. markets on Wednesday. The companies reported a slowdown in revenue-generating units. On Thursday, shares of Amazon (AMZN) fell some 13% and warned of a slower-than-expected Christmas period amid cautious consumer spending. Operating income at Amazon decreased to $2.5 billion in the quarter, compared to $4.9 billion in the same period in 2021.  Overall, shares in Alphabet, Apple (AAPL), Amazon, Meta and Microsoft have dropped by around $850 billion since Monday, as per reports.

42413773,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlC10q,1666943032,Bitcoin Could Rally to $63K Ahead of Next Mining Reward Halving: Matrixport,"""Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful,"" legendary investor Warren Buffett once said.  Perhaps now is the time to be greedy in the crypto market as the battered bitcoin (BTC) could soon find relief and rally to $63,000 by March 2024, when the cryptocurrency is likely to undergo mining reward halving – a programmed code aimed at reducing the pace of supply expansion by 50% every four years.  That's the latest forecast from Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto services provider Matrixport, which has $10 billion in assets under management.  The positive prediction is based on the assumption that bitcoin will repeat the bullish price action seen in the lead-up to the July 2016 and April 2020 halvings. On both occasions bitcoin ran into bullish winds 15 months ahead of the halving and, in the halving month, traded 39% higher from where it changed hands two years ago.  So if history is a guide, bitcoin could see a change of fortunes starting next month and rise to $63,160 by March 2024 to trade 39% higher than the March 2022 price of $45,538.  ""Prices started to rally 15 months before the next halving (November 2022) and they tend to finish 39% from where they traded 24 months prior. This would imply that bitcoin trades around $63,160 (March 2022 at $45,538*(1+39%) = $63,160) by March 2024,"" Thielen wrote in the latest edition of Matrix on Target note.  Past performance is no guarantee of future results. That said, history often rhymes and the macro outlook could improve in the coming months. Federal Reserve officials recently hinted at a slower pace of monetary tightening from December. Besides, there are signs of China softening its stance on crypto, according to Thielen.  ""The timing of Hong Kong potentially legalizing retail crypto trading in order to become a crypto hub right after China's Party Congress, which is held only twice every decade, signals that China is changing its stance towards crypto,"" Thielen noted.  ""Russia has also changed its stance in light of the economic sanctions. President [Vladimir] Putin and China are seeking an alternative to the USD system. Together with Saudi Arabia, which desires to join the BRICs nations and is keenly interested in upgrading their economy into Web3, a new multi-year crypto bull market might be starting,"" Thielen added.  Bitcoin has seen three reward halvings to date. Prices soared from $8,800 to $69,000 in 18 months following the third halving dated May 12, 2020.  The fourth halving was initially slated to happen in May 2024. However, with the hashrate or computing power dedicated to mining blocks surging during the bear market, the reward halving is now expected to take place in March 2024.  After the event, the per block reward paid to miners will drop from 6.25 BTC to 3.12 BTC, bringing the cryptocurrency's inflation rate down to 1.1%. Bitcoin miners solve complex algorithmic problems to mine blocks and verify transactions in return for rewards paid in BTC.  The cryptocurrency's fixed monetary policy of halving supply expansion every four years contrasts with the ever-increasing fiat money supply. That has motivated many, including business intelligence firm MicroStrategy, to adopt bitcoin as a reserve asset.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/28/bitcoin-could-rally-to-63k-by-2024-mining-reward-halving-matrixport,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6377c6b6a7cb27b48e314a6e5de2e9f73c0f7079-1280x1017.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In that timeframe, the altcoin has managed to increase in value by 3%. Over the last week, the coin rallied over 21%, breaking past multiple resistance levels, which has further strengthened the bulls. The coin has to zoom past two important resistance lines in order to continue its bullish streak. The technical outlook of the coin continued to display bullish momentum. There was a surplus of buyers as Ethereum price shot up to the overbought zone. Bitcoin has finally settled at the $20,000 price mark over the last 24 hours, turning other altcoins positive too. Ethereum price has been rangebound for multiple weeks, but with the overall market turning green, the coin has helped the altcoin eye its next major resistance line. If ETH manages to break past the $16,000 zone, then a move to the $2,000 price mark could be likely. On the other hand, if buying strength loses steam, then ETH can again start to exhibit rangebound price movement. Ethereum Price Analysis: One Day Chart ETH was trading at $1,560 at the time of writing. Ethereum price has soared considerably over the past week, breaking past its consolidation phase. If the coin has to sustain this price momentum, it is important that it trades above its immediate resistance of $1,630. Moving past that level will help the bulls challenge the $1,700 price mark. This would help the bullish thesis gain strength. ...",POSITIVE,ETH,ALTCOIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum-price-surge-might-not-last-if-the-bulls-dont-topple-these-levels/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/3441777.jpeg

42415162,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBXmBV,1666918246,"Elon Musk Finally Closes Twitter Acquisition, Fires Top Executives","Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, the world's richest person, finally completed his purchase of social media platform Twitter (TWTR) on Oct. 27 in a deal that takes the company private, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Dogecoin (DOGE), a cryptocurrency that's become synonymous with the billionaire, rallied.  Announced in April, the acquisition hit multiple roadblocks along the way, with Musk threatening to pull out because of allegations about the number of bots who use Twitter. The company at one point erected a barrier known as a poison pill to block the takeover.  But earlier this month, Musk proposed moving ahead again at the original price of $44 billion, or $54.20 per share, according to a letter from Musk's attorneys to Twitter's lawyers that was also filed with the SEC. Shares of Twitter were suspended from trading after Thursday's close, last trading at $53.70, and they are getting removed from the S&P 500, a benchmark for the U.S. stock market.  Meanwhile, DOGE surged, up 13% from 24 hours earlier as of 17:01 UTC on Friday. The billionaire has suggested using DOGE for payments on Twitter, and it's also become a proxy for sentiment about Musk. DOGE had rallied strongly in the lead-up to the deal's completion.  Musk fired Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal and two other executives, according to news reports.  Potential crypto plans for Twitter remain unclear. In June, Musk discussed the logic for Twitter integrating digital payments into its service, while Twitter previously added bitcoin tipping in 2021 under then-CEO Jack Dorsey and added ether wallets to the feature earlier this year. Twitter also became the first company to try out a new program from payments processor Stripe, which in April announced a feature enabling payments in USDC via Polygon.  Overall, Musk's takeover is being touted as a win for the crypto community. ""In the last few years, Elon has been very vocal about his stance on crypto and blockchain. Musk understands Web3 and understands the potential of blockchain technology which will be instrumental in propelling adoption forward,"" Ben Weiss, CEO of Bitcoin ATM company CoinFlip, told CoinDesk.  ""Decentralization is a real possibility for Twitter,"" Weiss also noted. ""In recent years, shutdowns and bans have become more prevalent. Regardless of your stance on the matter, decentralization takes the power away from corporations and gives it back to users.""
