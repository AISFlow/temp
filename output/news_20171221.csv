42428299,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL79ph,1513897224,Prosecutors File Charges in Alleged $250 Million Crypto Mining Fraud,"Authorities in South Korea have reportedly filed suit against a U.S. cryptocurrency mining firm, alleging a multi-million dollar fraud.  According to Korean news source Yonhap, prosecutors from the Incheon district of South Korea alleged in a press briefing that a company called Mining Max LLC solicited 270 billion Korean won – an amount worth roughly $250 million – from investors for cryptocurrency mining activities between September of last year and this past October.  Yet that money was largely spent enriching those behind the firm, prosecutors are arguing, despite offering investors high returns on their stakes. Further, it has been alleged that the results being shown to the investors, who number some 18,000 people from 54 countries, were falsified. As reported by Yonhap, just $70 million of the $250 million raised went to mining.  Within that group, an estimated 14,000 were based in South Korea, with 2,600 in the United States and 600 and 700 in China and Japan, respectively.  Upon inquiries, Mining Max responded through email:  ""We assure everyone concerned including our customers worldwide that our attorneys are fully cooperating with officials and providing any necessary information. We look forward to this process concluding as quickly as possible and anticipate that the investigation results will vindicate any allegations of wrongdoing on the part of principals of the company located in the U.S.""  According to the prosecutors, 21 suspects from the firm have been indicted, while the top executives from the firm are still at large, including its chairman and vice chairman.  U.S. presence  Public records found by CoinDesk indicate that the company maintained a presence across several U.S. states.  According to the websitehttps://miningmax.net/ of Mining Max LLC, the company is headquartered in California and describes itself as a maker of ethereum mining equipment that also offers ""premium cryptocurrency cloud mining rigs.""  Business records show that Mining Max LLC is registered at least in two states in the U.S., California and Nevada (where it is currently in default), with two different business addresses: 3600 Wilshire Blvd Ste 1200, Los Angeles, CA, and 6069 S Fort Apache Rd #100, Las Vegas, NV.  Both registration documents indicate that the manager and CEO of the firm is a person called Park Nam Ho. It appears that Park Nam Ho, also known as Daniel, is also the operator of another mining-related site, Cryptocurrenciesmining.com, and is the founder of a legal service named Angel Legal Service that is located at the same building as Mining Max.  Based on Mining Max's business registration in California, that legal service is also its registration agent, having been filed by a person called Lee Jin Ho.

Russian media sources RIA and TASS cited comments from lawmaker Anatoly Aksakov, who chairs the State Duma's financial markets committee, that the new rules – which will reportedly formalize rules around the creation and exchange of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin – are likely to be cleared by early next year.  ""I expect that the adoption of the draft law on [cryptocurrencies] will be in March... The problem is that we already have a lot of people who acquire [cryptocurrencies] and they are deceived, we need to give people the opportunity to work legally with it, to protect them as much as possible,"" Aksakov was quoted as saying by RIA.  The comments all but confirm that Russia won't finalize the bill by the end of the year, as Aksakov had previously suggested. In September, the senior lawmaker said he believed the work could be wrapped up before winter. The measure has faced a series of delays due, in part, to conflicting visions over the scope of the proposed laws.  The expected move to submit the bill also comes months after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered new regulations to be developed around cryptocurrencies and blockchain, including rules specifically aimed at initial coin offerings (ICOs).  As quoted by TASS, Aksakov cited Putin's directives when speaking about the work that is expected to play out over the coming weeks and months.  ""We have a deadline designated by the president, and after a week there will be a presentation of the bill that will start to be debated,"" he told reporters.

In a new post on its website, FINRA urged investors to do their homework when it comes to public companies that tout their activities involving blockchain or cryptocurrencies.  FINRA, an organization which provides testing and licensing for registered brokers and financial professionals, said that would-be investors should be ""cautious"" when assessing solicitations from such firms that seek to fund cryptocurrency initiatives ""without the business fundamentals and transparent financial reporting to back up such claims.""  The organization wrote:  ""Especially in today’s 'hot' cryptocurrency environment, it’s easy for companies or their promoters to make glorified claims about new products, services and other cryptocurrency-related connections. And, even when legitimate companies flock to a hot, new sector, fraudsters almost always follow suit, exploiting the news to launch their latest frauds du jour.""  The warning is perhaps a timely one, given several recent moves by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to halt trading of several publicly traded stocks, as well as a swath of announcements by previously uninvolved companies that are now working on blockchain projects.  Among the latter group is Long Island Iced Tea Corp., which announced today that it was changing its name to Long Blockchain Corp after ""shifting its primary corporate focus towards the exploration of [and] investment in opportunities that leverage the benefits of blockchain technology."" As reported by Bloomberg, the stock price for Long Island soared by more than 200 percent in the wake of its announcement.  In August, the SEC warned investors about the risk of public stock pump-and-dump schemes that use cryptocurrency as a marketing tool.  ""These frauds include 'pump-and-dump' and market manipulation schemes involving publicly traded companies that claim to provide exposure to these new technologies,"" the agency said at the time.

42428312,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7AHh,1513876216,2017: Saluting the Non-Stop Price Drama That Was,"Arthur Hayes is a former derivatives trader for Deutsche Bank and Citigroup, and the current CEO of bitcoin derivatives exchange BitMEX.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review opinion series.      Act I: Bye bye China  2017's epic cryptocurrency rally may seem sudden. It's not.  To understand where we went, we have to go back all the way to August 2015, when the PBOC conducted a shock devaluation of the yuan. Imminent fears of more currency debasement prompted Chinese bitcoin punters to break the cryptocurrency out of its $200-to-$300 prison.  By 1 Jan. 2017, bitcoin rose 5x to $1,000.  Unknowingly priming the market were yuan bears who dominated the news with forecasts of a mega-devaluation before Chinese New Year, and Chinese savers fearful of currency debasement continued to purchase bitcoin as a hedge. This narrative framed the bullish case for bitcoin.  At the time, the vast majority of all trading volume remained on the big three Chinese exchanges (OKCoin, Huobi and BTCC).  Then the PBOC struck. Just as it had in Dec. 2013, the PBOC reminded the world that bitcoin was risky. There was talk of inspections by government authorities into the operations of the largest exchanges. Next, the PBOC banned margin trading, the bread-and-butter exchange profit engine.  The rally turned quickly into an aggressive bear raid, chopping close to 30 percent off the price.  However, unlike 2013, bitcoin in 2017 proved a different animal. In under one week, the price completely retraced and continued to march higher. The PBOC reached for their FUD playbook and announced that the major exchanges violated KYC/AML rules and must now submit to rigorous government inspections.  The price tanked once more but less violently. Again after a few days, a complete retrace occurred, and bitcoin made new highs. Frustrated, the PBOC decreed that bitcoin withdrawals were now halted. At this point, the Chinese exchanges lost all relevance to the price of bitcoin.  The market took this negative news in stride and continued higher.  The bull market baton shifted from China to Japan and South Korea. The Japanese government regulated the market and provided a sensible regulatory regime for exchanges to operate under. South Koreans took to bitcoin as they had other digital assets, and local exchanges rose to dominate global trading volumes.  Act II: IC-what?  But just while the North Asia bitcoin melodrama played out, the ICO craze intensified.  Project after project, even those with questionable underlying value, raised gargantuan sums of money. Bancor, BAT and Status were some of the hottest deals in 2017. With ether up over 30x from the start of the year, upcoming mega-deals such as Tezos, EOS and Filecoin gained masonic status.  And the value proposition was easy enough to understand. ICOs purported to shift the balance of power away from gentil VC gatekeepers, and allow the plebs to fund the technology of tomorrow.  As ICOs raised more capital, the Chinese government curiously allowed the exchanges to re-enable bitcoin withdrawals. That set the ICO market on fire. Now the world's greatest punters could exchange RMB for bitcoin and ether, and then purchase any ICO.  The race was on to issue ICOs aimed at the Chinese, Korean and Japanese markets.  The hunger of the proles to place their economic future in anything other than overpriced stocks and property allowed deals to raise god-like sums of money.  Act III: Back to bitcoin  As the summer waned, the scaling debate hit a fever pitch. The big and small blockers organized successive games of chicken to force the community to finally decide how bitcoin would scale.  The first game was the user-activated soft fork (UASF). The Bitcoin Core acolytes pushed forward a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal that if SegWit was not activated by Aug. 1st, a possible chain split would occur. Exchanges, miners and holders were scared shitless of the consequences of a chain split.  In desperation, the miners came together under the New York Agreement and enacted a face-saving measure to activate SegWit, and a possible hard fork to a 2 MB block size in Q4 2017.  At the last minute, a group of big blockers proposed a bitcoin hard fork to an 8 MB block. This was the birth of bitcoin cash and the start of the bitcoin-fork-o-rama.  Bitcoin cash (or bcash) emerged with a non-zero value, and exchange after exchange listed the altcoin. Some miners continued to support it for pure ideological reasons, and the pump and dump team kept the volatility high to entertain traders.  Still, something unexpected happened. Bitcoin hard forked, and both chains survived. The price dipped down to $3,000 but quickly rebounded and made higher highs.  Act IV: Regulators mount up  Back in ICO-land, the craze continued even as many governments attempted to pour cold water on the concept. Countless alphabet-letter regulatory agencies around the globe beat the drum that ICOs were volatile, of questionable value and possibly operating in violation of securities laws.  However, the punters ignored the brahmins and continued to invest.  China decided it had had enough, effectively declaring that its citizens should not be able to escape the equity and property markets. In the run up to the National Congress, bitcoin's potential threat to societal harmony was deemed too great to avoid a good stamping out. As a result, the PBOC decreed ICO fundraising illegal, and shut down all cryptocurrency exchanges in China.  The market sighed, but continued higher. Bitcoin inexorably marched towards $10,000.  Act V: ShitCoin2x  The next obstacle was the SegWit2x hard fork.  The signers of the New York Agreement were steadfast that bitcoin should be upgraded to a 2 MB block with SegWit. However, many were perplexed why such a hard fork was needed. Surely those who wanted big blocks could purchase bcash?  The SegWit2x proponents did not heed calls for replay protection, which meant that if the hard fork happened, it might be contentious. Exchange after exchange clarified and re-clarified what they would call the ""real"" bitcoin.  In the end, vocal community stakeholders, myself included, called SegWit2x what it really was, a shitcoin.  At the last minute, the miners, exchanges and community leaders supporting SegWit2x dropped their support. It died an inglorious death days before the scheduled hard fork.  Act V: CME goes all-in  It was pump time for bitcoin.  As bitcoin hovered around $7,000, the community wondered what would take us to the $10,000 promised land. Then, CME Group, one of the largest derivatives exchanges in the world, announced it would list a US-dollar denominated bitcoin futures contract. That set the market on fire.  In the next few weeks, the market screamed higher and surpassed $10,000. That is where we stand now.  After hard forks, and governments attempting to stifle the rise of bitcoin, the largest exchanges in the world (the CME, the CBOE and Nasdaq) blessed bitcoin as a real asset.

In a statement yesterday, the Texas State Securities Board revealed that it had taken action against USI-Tech Limited, a firm based in Dubai. The firm has allegedly been trying to sell investment contracts in ""dozens of Texas cities"" by way of social media videos, dedicated websites, and advertisements on sites like Craigslist. It names two U.S.-based agents, Clifford Thomas of Maryland and Michael Rivera of California.  According to a presentation dated April of this year and posted to LinkedIn, USI is centered around the sale of software for bitcoin mining and trading. The presentation includes claimed breakdowns of how much money in commissions would-be participants can make based on the number of referrals they generate.  The Securities Board said that the company claimed to offer steady, daily returns – a structure reminiscent of high-yield investment plans that boast steady gains. Further, the solicitations reportedly encourage prospective investors to find others to buy in so that they can make money from ""referrals.""  The Securities Board wrote:  ""The agents' websites claim the mining investment 'derives its value from [USI-Tech's] non-exclusive interest in a series of bitcoin mining contracts.' They promise a daily return of 1%. The USI-Tech website says its bitcoin platform “consistently provides returns of up to 150% per year."" The returns do not depend on the value of bitcoin, according to the company.""  According to the statement, those named in the cease-and-desist order were accused of violating Texas securities registration standards and failing to disclose the risks involved in bitcoin mining.  ""In addition to violating registration requirements, USI-Tech and the sales agents are violating State Securities Board rules by failing to disclose information investors would need to make an informed decision about whether to invest,"" the agency added.

42428314,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7ALh,1513864841,How Regulators Become Blockchain Innovators,"Ryan Peterson is general manager for economic policy at the Central Bank of Aruba, where he researches complex adaptive systems theory.  The following article, an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review, represents his personal opinion and does not necessarily reflect the views of Central Bank of Aruba.      Monetary and macro-prudential policies have traditionally been the main occupancy of central banks and financial regulators.  But the recent surge in financial technologies, cryptocurrencies and digital transformation is gradually shaping strategic thinking and tinkering on regulatory innovation. While regulatory reactions have been ambivalent, ambiguous and oftentimes antagonistic, it would be challenging to think of 21st-century regulation without innovation.  Associated with the rise in digital transformation is not only a set of new (distributed) technologies and institutional mechanisms, but more importantly, the transformation and evolution of certain values, norms and beliefs about the nature of money and trust.  Beyond money and markets, the social reconstruction and codification of trust is a fundamental inflection point in the evolution of financial services.  While it may seem revolutionary, if not paradoxical at first hand, increasingly regulators are becoming innovators as they entertain, explore and experiment with the adoption of distributed ledger technologies (DLT), digital currencies, application programming interfaces (API), artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR) and a host of other digital technologies.  From a population ecology perspective, what we are witnessing is a form of speciation or ""polymerization"" – a process whereby small nascent variations (like digital currencies) could accumulate over time into systemic changes, which hypothetically result in the emergence of novel hybrid species (think central bank digital currency).  While it may be true that innovation usually precedes regulation, in more evolutionary terms, the regulatory landscape is undergoing a systemic transformation in nurturing trust and fostering resilience. Beyond digitization, developmental legacies and idiosyncrasies continue to shape this development.  For instance, across the Caribbean, these pathologies include thin and fragmented financial markets and relatively high levels of financial exclusion and economic inertia. Thus, the confluence of both (societal) ""pull"" forces and (digital) ""push"" forces are propelling digital innovation and the transformation of Caribbean regulators as they seek inclusive sustainable growth.  Clear of an industrial revolution of the fourth kind, what we are experiencing is really a societal evolution of the fifth degree.  Larger lens  Stepping back, history is full of accounts of the rise and fall of empires, institutions and networks expanding and transforming.  Despite sharp distinctions in time and context, a common challenge in all such ventures has been the institutionalized dichotomy between the pressure for centralization to assure direction, consistency and control; and the countering pressure for decentralization to secure responsiveness, ownership and adaptability. Although the events of history may not repeat themselves, the reactions that evoke this challenging balance seem to persist through time.  If evolutionary forces hold true, it is very likely that within a decade we will experience not only a shift from centralized control and technologies toward distributed control and shared platforms, but more importantly, a paradigm shift and the emergence of hybrid systems that crossbreed and combine the strengths of centralization and decentralization.  Rather than juxtapose centralization and decentralization as absolutes, digital hybridization allows for a dynamically stable architecture and ambidexterity.  As architects of the future, nimble regulators are likely to take the lead, as witnessed by recent accounts of innovation and experimentation by monetary and financial authorities. Yet, rather than maintain stability and a steady state, digital hybridization will demand resiliency and steady change on the part of these new orchestrators. Moreover, trust rather than technology will be fundamental in this transformation.  Following the law of requisite variety, viable regulation in dynamic (distributed) environments begets regulatory resilience. In pro-active (feedforward) regulation, each systemic dynamic will have to be compensated by an appropriate response from the regulator.  If we wish to maintain stability in the face of vulnerability, the regulator must be able to generate at least as many strategies as there are dynamics.  Navigating course  The growth in the variety of cryptocurrencies, financial technology charters, regulatory sandboxes, blockchain collaborations and experimentations with (central bank) digital currencies are early, yet they present signs of evolution in motion.  It is thus no coincidence that the rise in open banking and fintech is transpiring in tandem with the application of regulatory technologies for customer due diligence. To maintain resilience and steady change, the unbundling and specialization of financial ecosystems requires the new (peer-to-peer) channels and (shared) platforms for reconnecting and integration.  Leaning into the future and leading with foresight will require nimbleness and agility. (Much like Odysseus, regulators will need to sail through the Strait of Messina, thereby avoiding Scylla on the rocky cliffs and the whirlpool of Charybdis.)  While some speculate on the demise of regulators, the art of steersmanship, and thus governance, is knowing how to adjust your sails in the midst of unexpected changing circumstances.  In more evolutionary terms, it is not the strongest of species, but the most nimble that thrive on transformation.  Counterpoint? CoinDesk is open for opinions as part of our ongoing 2017 in Review.

42428301,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL79xh,1513861259,Buyer Beware? Credit Creeps Into Crypto,"Marc Hochstein is the managing editor of CoinDesk and a former editor-in-chief of American Banker.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.    ""Neither a lender nor a borrower be.""    Polonius' advice to Laertes in ""Hamlet"" might well have been a rallying cry for the early bitcoin adopters who sought an alternative to fractional reserve banking.  On a blockchain, an asset can be in your wallet, or it can be in my wallet. It cannot be in both at the same time. You can still lend it to me, but if you do, it's like letting me borrow your lawnmower – you can't mow your own lawn until I return it. Unlike banks as we know them, lenders of bitcoin cannot create money out of thin air, Jamie Dimon's comments notwithstanding.  Quite apart from providing an alternative to central bank money creation, however, cryptocurrencies and blockchains imply liberation from more prosaic forms of credit.    For example, the peer-to-peer architecture of cryptocurrency means transactions are continuously settled on a gross, or one-to-one, basis, rather than waiting to net out a batch of debits and credits across the books of a central intermediary.      Meanwhile, blockchain securities platforms such as tZERO seek to collapse Wall Street's Rube Goldberg assembly line of trade, clearing and settlement into something closer to ""one and done.""      And in an emerging type of crypto transaction called atomic cross-chain swaps, it is impossible for only one side of a trade to go through. It gets done, or it doesn’t.    All of these innovations should, in theory, reduce the need for credit to bridge the gap between trade and settlement, and lead us to a world without baffling distinctions on our bank statements like ""current balance"" versus ""available balance.""  And yet, credit, in various forms, is creeping into the blockchain economy.  Leveraged bets    Consider the following:    With bitcoin's price hitting new all-time highs and garnering mainstream media coverage, there are secondhand reports of U.S. consumers going into debt to buy cryptocurrency. ""We've seen mortgages being taken out to buy bitcoin,"" Joseph Borg, president of the North American Securities Administrators Association, said on CNBC. ""People do credit cards, equity lines,"" said Borg, who is also director of the Alabama Securities Commission.  Most or all of the major crypto exchanges offer margin trading (including, ironically, Poloniex, which apparently did not heed its Shakespearian namesake's advice). BitFlyer, based in Japan, for example, allows traders to leverage up to 15 times their cash deposit. To be fair, the lending on these platforms is often peer-to-peer, between exchange customers. ""We don't take any risk. The trading is between our customers,"" bitFlyer's CEO Yuzo Kano told the Financial Times recently.  At CoinDesk's Consensus: Invest conference last month, there was much talk of bringing other forms of leverage, such as prime brokerage and securities lending-type services, into the crypto market to accommodate demand from newly-arrived institutional investors.  There is some speculation that Tether, the issuer of a dollar-pegged cryptocurrency, has been printing tokens to drive up the price of bitcoin on Bitfinex, an affiliated crypto exchange. For the record, Tether has said its tokens are fully backed and that a forthcoming audit should put the doubts to rest.  Some out there will say: Told you so.  According to one school of thought, credit, be it net settlement or fractional reserve banking, is necessary for a functioning financial system, and to think otherwise is naive utopianism.  Expressing this view, Perry Mehrling, an economics professor at Columbia University's Barnard College, exhorted techies to wake up and smell the interdependency in a September blog post:  ""...[M]arkets are being made to convert one cryptocurrency into another, and ... markets are being made to convert cryptocurrency into so-called fiat. Someone or something is making those markets, and in so doing expanding and contracting a balance sheet, in search of expected profit. ... Cryptos fear credit, but I suspect they will soon discover that credit is a feature not a bug, and that will require them to re-examine the implicit monetary theory that underlies their coding.""  But there's another way to look at the situation, which might be summed up as: there goes the neighborhood.  The phantom menace    In other words, an influx of get-rich-quick types, whether they're individuals taking out loans to buy crypto or institutional investors seeking to juice returns with leverage, could encourage the sort of behavior that bitcoin was designed to escape.      Like, say, a hosted wallet provider lending out customers' bitcoin without telling them.    ""I fear the financialization of bitcoin, in the sense that it may create phantom bitcoin that may not actually exist,"" said Caitlin Long, the president and chairman of Symbiont, an enterprise blockchain startup.  As a Wall Street veteran, Long doesn't fit the typical bitcoiner profile, but she's been personally investing in the cryptocurrency since as far back as 2013, when her day job was running the pension business at Morgan Stanley.  ""As more of the non-philosophical owners of bitcoin come in to bitcoin, where you're seeing more and more of a push toward the financialization of it, I think that would be a shame,"" she said. ""Even though it would boost the price in the short term, it would remove bitcoin from being a true store of value.""  Switching back to the securities markets, Long said she doesn’t buy the argument that net settlement is necessary for a system to function. For one thing, the practice creates little-appreciated risks.  ""As long as you're allowing net settlement, you're not forcing a true-up on every trade that there is one buyer and one seller,"" she said. ""If you're allowing net settlement, what you're really doing is allowing multiple buyers for only one asset.""    Hence situations like the court case this year in which brokerage firms had sold more shares in Dole Food than the company had actually issued.    Further, Long said, the global financial markets have dragged their feet in speeding up settlement times not because the status quo is efficient but because it's profitable for incumbents.  ""The whole reason we have T+3, T+2 settlement is for securities lending,"" she said. ""It's all about brokerage firms who want to be able to lend their clients' securities to other clients and take a spread.""  Reality check    In this light, blockchains are not the mere fantasy of a coterie of anarcho-capitalists and Silicon Valley propellerheads, as a number of skeptical academics, journalists and bloggers make the technology out to be.    Rather, if put into wider practice, blockchains might dispel many current, widely held fantasies.    To be sure, there may be times where credit (ultimately another word for ""trust"") is truly unavoidable. By trusting me not to run out the door without paying, the grocer is in a sense extending me credit for the minute or so between when I pick up a jar of pickles from the shelf and when I pay at the counter.      And when you order a pickle slicer from Amazon, you are in a way extending credit to the retailer by paying and waiting a few days for the delivery.      But these are transactions involving physical objects, and the ""loan"" terms are only as long as they need to be. When the items being exchanged are purely electronic abstractions (as money and securities increasingly are), what purpose does credit (waiting to be remunerated) serve?      It's a question that we should at least ask, and demand better answers than ""this is the way it's always been done.""      This above all: To thine own trades be true.

According to the update, Tether has reopened ""limited"" wallet services to users since Tuesday, allowing them to start withdrawing funds held in their wallet, if so desired.  While few details were provided, Tether also announced it is developing a new platform and will be discontinuing its current wallet services and old addresses. New registrations to its platform are currently not being accepted.  The startup advises users to exchange their tether tokens on third-party exchanges, adding:  ""To prevent against possible loss of funds, users should not attempt to deposit any funds to their old wallet or deposit addresses.""

Talking to British lawmakers in Parliament, Carney said that bitcoin's recent price moves are ""significant"" and more like an ""equity-type risk,"" Reuters reports.  He stated that:  ""At present, we don't view [bitcoin] as a financial stability issue.""  Bitcoin is the number one cryptocurrency by market valuation, and recently reached an all-time high of around $20,000. At press time, it was trading at just over $16,700.  Carney, who also acts as chair of the G20's Financial Stability Board – a group of central banks and finance ministers that is also conducting its own blockchain research – further said that the idea of central bank-issued digital currency that can be used by the public has ""some fundamental problems"" unless there is a restriction in the amount that people can hold.  The BoE governor further noted, though, that he is ""interested"" in the distributed ledger technology (DLT) and that the central bank's own FinTech accelerator shows DLT's potential. According to a Bloomberg report, he added that the BoE is ""active"" in DLT, but is in no hurry to apply it to the core of the banking system, as any new technology has to satisfy a ""five sigma quality rating.""  Carney has been commenting blockchain since the start of the year, when he said DLT has the potential to ""fundamentally reshape banking including by sharply increasing liquidity risk for traditional banks.""  The official's statements come as global central banks are increasingly active in their work with blockchain and DLT.  The BoE has said that a forthcoming version of its real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system – which settles around £500 billion daily – will be compatible with distributed ledger technology. Meanwhile, monetary authorities in Canada, China and Russia, among others, have all expressed interest in a central bank-issued digital currency.

42428315,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7ANh,1513846832,Writing the Blockchain Rulebook in 2018,"Josh Garcia is a fintech and blockchain Lawyer at Cooley LLP, where he helps clients with compliance advice, government enforcement actions and inquiry letters.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      The regulators are coming.  They have formed committees, subpoenaed documents, studied white papers, and will march into 2018 armed with enforcement actions. These actions will be more in the vein of re-actions, as regulators will attempt to stem the darker tides of cryptocurrency: promises of ludicrous returns, Ponzi schemes, and other obvious violations of securities laws.  When the gavel lands, even the best-meaning and most honest developers may have to cope with a rulebook built for criminals.  That's one scenario.  Here's another: Industry leaders take action tailored for a specific business purpose, time and market sentiment. The rest of the industry follows without fully considering the fit for their businesses. This occurred spectacularly as the ""ICO"" or ""token sale"" frenzy took off over the summer.  Businesses traditionally averse to crypto created and sold blockchain tokens without asking why their business needed access to a distributed network of computers.  Regulation through penalties and accidental leadership have both set the industry’s standards to date. This coming year presents an opportunity for a third way forward, where key contributors develop principled standards and encourage their use through a self-regulatory organization (SRO), a certification entity, via new law drafted with regulators and lawmakers or through new frameworks that creatively navigate old law.  Regulation through penalties  Regulators turn to regulation by enforcement because the law moves achingly slow.  The Administrative Procedure Act requires a notice and comment period between the proposal of a rule and its final publication in the Federal Register (where it carries the force of law). A notice and comment period tends to stretch rulemaking out at least a year.  This timeline means every government agency that could potentially issue comprehensive regulation over token sales and the secondary markets, including the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), must, by law, move at the speed of glue.  The only way for a guard dog to stay relevant is to bark or to bite. Put more elegantly, a regulator can make its presence known by either pronouncing a new interpretation of old law or putting someone in prison and assessing a hefty penalty.  FinCEN barked in 2013 guidance and drew the acceptance and transmission of convertible virtual currencies close enough to take bites at the industry. The SEC barked in its DAO report and warned cryptocurrency exchanges not to list security tokens without the proper registration, and recently warned issuers to avoid promises of exchange listing.  The CFTC bit, in a few different places, and now takes the position that margin trading of cryptocurrencies and fraud in the bitcoin spot markets can both fall under its jurisdiction.  Regulation by enforcement is not the same as true rulemaking. It is standard setting by fiat. True rulemaking usually involves careful study of a range of issues, serious inquiry into the most pressing and harmful ones, and a principled approach that responsibly resolves the issues or minimizes their occurrence without chilling innovation.  Regulators can take a careful, studied approach prior to issuing new proposed rules. Proposals of one regulator often contain upwards of 800 pages of research, summaries of comments and exacting policy positions for each subsection of a new rule.  But that process can’t happen through the federal government any time soon.  The necessarily slow pace of rulemaking is inadequate to govern rapid advancements in applied cryptography. The industry should view 2018 as a golden moment to set its own standards. The time may pass for the industry to pen a comprehensive set of guidelines with fresh ink. Let that moment slip and regulators will draft rules within the charred outlines of criminal enterprises.  Accidental leadership  To be clear, standard setting through leadership has occurred already. But it has been either reactive or accidental.  The reactive standard arrives piecemeal, in response to crisis after crisis. The white hat response to the Parity hack was a prime example of specialists spearheading efforts in a reactive fashion to stop the theft of funds where the government could not.  Cryptocurrency exchanges have reacted swiftly and intelligently to customer complaints and flash crashes in the market, offering examples of how to set new standards on the fly.  Other standards arise simply because companies desperately want to replicate success. This has resulted in standard-following without introspection. Token sales, mentioned above, have become a fundraising option set to outpace traditional financing in fintech.  But many companies selling tokens do not have a good reason for developing on a blockchain. Other companies opt for a Swiss foundation without fully thinking through the operational implications of running a business out of several countries.  These practices became the market standard by accident.  A principled approach  A mature industry will need a principled set of rules in order to thrive.  The best way to develop those rules is to reach out to smart, engaged community members and to seek their input. The Uniform Law Commission did exactly this as it worked with Coin Center to develop a new uniform virtual currency licensing law that could be adopted by all 50 states. We believe Cooley did this as well with the SAFT Project, an open-source effort inviting community input to develop a token sale framework that navigates existing law. The Brooklyn Project is another example inviting public comment.  New technology on the horizon will need new standards. Otherwise, newbies will be harmed.  For instance, decentralized exchanges have no standards for protecting against spoofing, wash trading or other market manipulation. Open-source software will one day allow anyone to create and trade regulated financial instruments from their smartphone with a few simple taps. New entrants will thus risk exposure to derivatives touted by anonymous sellers as lucrative investments on unregulated markets.  The industry can wait for regulators. But even when regulators take the time to think about their rules, they can come up short.  Take New York's BitLicense and compare it against the Uniform Regulation of Virtual Currency Businesses Act. One took industry input that regulators decided in their discretion was either valid or not, while the other had regulators and industry experts working in concert to draft law.  Place these two work products side-by-side and see how stark the differences are. Many companies that did found the poorly-tailored BitLicense's requirements too onerous and decided not to operate in New York. This drove innovation and opportunity out of a key state and into other markets.  The industry has a few paths toward principled standard-setting:  Form an independent, profit-agnostic SRO that proposes standards to govern token sales, secondary market activity, or the creation new financial instruments. FINRA and NFA offer excellent examples of how SROs serve, respectively, the securities and commodities industries.  Create a certification entity that certifies compliance with any new standards, whether set by an SRO or otherwise.  Work with regulators and lawmakers to identify salient risks and codify rules that deter bad actors from engaging in activity harmful to investors or consumers.  Propose regulatory frameworks, much like the SAFT proposal, so the industry can comply in innovative ways without halting deal flow.  The market follows leaders. Which means the market can follow itself off a cliff if it isn't careful.  The time is ripe to set principled standards, or the industry risks having regulators and accidents of history set unhelpful standards for all.

As part of Fanusie's work to educate the public on his findings, the former Central Intelligence Agency analyst has today released a report detailing the work. Published on business security website Cipher Brief, the report details an unintended and perhaps sobering consequence of bitcoin's skyrocketing price.  Fanusie told CoinDesk:  ""If you care about cryptocurrency gaining adoption, you can't close your eyes to illicit actors trying to use it. If they're going to use it we need to look at this as a society and a government to understand what it means.""  In plain sight  Most interestingly, though, may be that rather than any cloak-and-dagger investigative techniques, Fanusie instead gathered his intelligence from online websites.  Specifically, the information was pulled directly from propaganda sites for both the extremist group Al Queda and its rival, the Islamic State (IS), as well as a jihadist website monitoring group and an Israeli research institute that keeps tabs on this type of web activity.  In the research, patterns also emerged. For example, after the bitcoin addresses associated with the fundraising campaigns were posted to public-facing websites, they were then promoted using Facebook and Telegram. According to the report, both of the social media sites eventually blocked the related users, but that didn't keep new accounts from quickly popping up.  While most of the bitcoin addresses failed to receive any funds, the most successful received a bitcoin donation worth about $685, used to build a camp in Syria and provide reinforcement.  Shortly after the 0.0757 bitcoin was donated to the still-active campaign, the cryptocurrency (worth about $1,389) was moved to a separate account. Other fundraising activities included more mundane efforts such as website hosting. As of Dec, 19, Fanusie has confirmed to CoinDesk the funds had still not been spent.  ""In general,"" Fanusie told CoinDesk, ""it appears these campaigns have not been very successful, for the most part, of course every cent matters.""  The United Nations last year estimated that the number of casualties in the Syrian civil war alone — not counting other engagements involving ISIS and Al Qaeda — is now upwards of 400,000 people.  A cause for concern  And while the total amount raised is minimal, a notable aspect of the report is what appears to be the increasing sophistication of the campaigns seeking bitcoin funds.  In one case, first reported by the Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center based in Israel, a website identified by Fanusie as being ""pro-IS"" appears to have initiated its fundraising campaign using bitcoin processing site CoinGate.  While CoinGate told CoinDesk the user was ""blocked...prior to publication of this case,"" Fanusie said the website that originally posted it, Akhbar al-Muslimeen, has since generated as many as a dozen bitcoin addresses without the need of a bitcoin processor.  From the report:  ""This shows some technical sophistication on the part of that site’s administrators, because they apparently have eliminated their dependence on digital currency exchange services. Also, because the site’s donation page generates a variety of bitcoin addresses where funds can be sent, instead of just one, it may be harder for outsiders to monitor donations.""  In spite of this technical proficiency though, Fanusie hedged the overall sophistication of the operations.  The pseudonymous nature of bitcoin means the technology doesn't provide as much protection as the Islamist extremist organizations seem to believe. Still, going forward, Fanusie is concerned that could change.  His report concludes with a warning that while cryptocurrency could help provide financial services to those unable to get a bank account, more advanced identity protection could even-further embolden terrorist fundraising efforts.  ""If anonymization gets more prevalent within cryptocurrencies, are we going to have a problem like we had with the iPhone encryption issue we had a couple of years ago?"" Fanusie asked, concluding:  ""That's the issue down the road that I'm most concerned about.""
