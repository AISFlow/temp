42398295,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT7G1,1427145129,Nasdaq Trading Technology to Power Bitcoin Marketplace Noble,"Major American stock exchange Nasdaq has announced a first-of-its-kind partnership with bitcoin startup Noble Markets.  As part of the deal, Noble will utilize Nasdaq's X-stream technology upon its formal launch, joining the 30 global marketplace that currently use the multi-asset trading platform. Led by founder and CEO John Betts, Noble Markets boasts a team with experience at traditional financial giants such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch and UBS.  Perhaps best known in the bitcoin community as one of the investors and organisers behind the campaign SaveGox.com, Betts has also served as VP of strategy for Strevus, a regulatory compliance platform provider that added support for digital currency startups in 2014.  Betts indicated that his latest venture seeks to leapfrog competitors in the market by providing many of the functionalities they may be seeking to build out of the box. For example, Betts went on to suggest that, as a marketplace, Noble won't aim to compete against bitcoin exchanges, but instead seek to provide liquidity to these companies.  Betts told CoinDesk:  ""We're not trying to fight for a slice of the pie, we're building the venue where the large capital that exists in the capital markets and corporations that use these products as part of their business needs, where we can provide that liquidity to other exchanges. The goal is to create a larger pie.""  Describing the product as a bridge between the traditional financial and bitcoin communities, Betts said that Noble aims to find ""the best of both worlds"" in terms of attracting these now disparate ecosystems.  Betts suggested that Nasdaq, in turn, was eager to work with a partner in the bitcoin space and that they were an active player in helping to forge the relationship.  Solving a business need  Key to this goal of growing the size of the bitcoin market, Betts contends, will be services that utilize bitcoin but provide a more familiar experience to entrants from traditional financial backgrounds.  Equipped with Nasdaq's technology, Betts believes Noble will be best positioned to tackle this problem, given that it will use standard interfaces built on ""20 years of intellectual property"".  ""They need counterparties that will provide the services they need to do business, and they have not had a counterparty that they've been able to trade bitcoin with,"" Betts added.  Betts went on to state that Noble has invested its own resources into building what he categorized as robust real-time risk management, consolidation and settlement capabilities.  Further, he suggested these tools would be necessary for any marketplace that wanted to convince larger players they could be responsible for customer assets.  Nasdaq embraces innovation  In statements, representatives of Nasdaq sought to portray the announcement as one that positions the more than 40-year-old company as supportive of ""new and emerging technologies"".  Lars Ottersgård, Nasdaq's executive vice president of market technology, said his company will continue to support the efforts of Noble as it explores the use of its technology in a new market.  ""We are thrilled to work with the experienced industry veterans at Noble Markets and look forward to supporting their cutting-edge, new endeavor for the long term in addressing the needs of the digital currency space,"" Ottersgård said.  Betts went on to say that, based on his personal experience, he believes major financial institutions are beginning to evolve their thinking about the larger bitcoin ecosystem to the point where they're now eager to get involved with the technology.  Though he believes bitcoin provides a number of inherent advantages, Betts suggested that benefits by themselves are not enough, concluding:  ""To be able to leverage that, there are other products and services they need, and that's part of the Noble Markets value proposition.""

42398286,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT798,1427143242,Three Blockchain Startups Selected for Barclays Accelerator,"Three startups working on blockchain-related products and services have been selected to join Barclays Accelerator in London this spring.  Enrolled in the 90-day mentorship-driven program, which began today, are bitcoin exchange Safello, bitcoin-based debit card creators Atlas Card, and Blocktrace, which aims to provide blockchain solutions for the insurance industry.  “The selection of Safello, Atlas Card and Blocktrace by Barclays Accelerator, at the very least, signals increased curiosity in the cryptocurrency space,” said Frank Schuill, CEO at Safello, adding:  “That is already a major improvement from when we first started with Safello in 2013. We are moving from dismissal to curiosity. Now it is our job to take it to the next level.”  The fintech-focussed startup incubator is powered by Techstars, which was founded in 2006 and is backed by over 75 VC firms.  Startups from more than 60 countries applied to be part of the program, but only 10 were selected.  Schuill said Barclays was “heavily involved” in the selection process, with the final round comprising a question-and-answer session with 20-30 members of the Barclays team.  Intensive schedule  The chosen companies will receive $20,000 seed funding from Techstars and will also benefit from an intensive schedule of networking, mentoring and development.  Those behind Atlas Card are no strangers to this type of environment, having taken part in Tribe 4's tenure in Boost VC’s startup accelerator.  Atlas Card has something of an interesting set of founders, including James Schuler, who is an Olympic qualifier in pole-vaulting, Thiel Fellowhttp://www.thielfellowship.org/about/about-the-fellowship/ and Y combinator graduate.  Simon Edhouse, co-founder and director of strategy at Blocktrace, explained his company hopes to assist in minimising jewellery-related insurance fraud. The company aims to provide a ledger for diamond identification and transaction verification for various stakeholders, from insurance companies and policy holders to claimants and law enforcement agencies.  Edhouse said being accepted into the Barclays Accelerator program has been a ""real honour"", adding:  ""[It] represents a significant opportunity for us not only because of the immediate high level of attention focused on the solution, but also due to the abundant opportunities for quality mentoring and access to a range of prospective investors and the wider Techstars global network.""  Driving innovation  Derek White, chief design officer at Barclays, said he recognises that, to drive innovation within his company, the international financial services provider needs to embrace the innovative startup ecosystem.  “Many of the teams enrolling today are exploring technologies that could particularly help transform the ways banks operate so I’m keen to see how their ideas develop,” he added.  For the next few months, the 10 companies will be based at the London Escalator, an open innovation space in the east of the city.  All the companies involved in the Barclays Accelerator will take part in a public demo day on 22nd June.  The New York-based version of the Barclays Accelerator programme has now opened its application process.

42398285,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT77A,1427139019,Anycoin Direct Expands to 14 New European Markets,"Bitcoin brokerage Anycoin Direct has added TrustPay as a new payment option, opening the company to 14 new markets in Europe.  The deal enables the Netherlands-based brokerage to receive instant wire transfers from customers in markets such as Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Hungary and others in the region.  Anycoin Direct  provides brokerage services for bitcoin as well as altcoins including litecoin, darkcoin and dogecoin.  Co-founder Bram Ceelen told CoinDesk:  “With the addition of TrustPay, we now serve almost all the European market. Our goal is to make buying and selling bitcoin as easy as possible. To do this we work with as many local trusted payment methods as possible to make sure the buy process goes as smooth as possible.”  The move builds off previous efforts to grow in the European bitcoin market, after announcing its growth strategy last year. The company raised €500,000 as part of a seed round in January, a funding effort led by a private investor.  At the time, co-founder Lennert Vlemmings suggested that some of those funds would be used to adopt new payment methods for the platform.  TrustPay  did not respond to requests for comment by press time.

42398289,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT789,1427135789,TeraExchange Adds Former NYSE Head as Advisor,"Former New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) CEO and Goldman Sachs partner Duncan Niederauer has joined regulated bitcoin futures exchange TeraExchange.  The former NYSE exec will serve as an advisory director, providing insight to the increasingly bitcoin-focused firm. Niederauer retired from his position in 2014, having held the post since 2007.  TeraExchange  CEO Christian Martin explained that Niederauer will most importantly help the company develop its strategy and to capitalize on available market opportunities.  Martin told CoinDesk:  “Duncan has great pedigree when it comes to market structure and also a great history of traveling in circles that we’re trying to introduce ourselves to.”  While just one of a number of Wall Street execs that have recently joined the bitcoin community, he went on to suggest that TeraExchange provided a unique opportunity given its approval from the CFTC for its operations last year.  “Because we’re already regulated, I think there’s a comfort level that other pockets of the bitcoin infrastructure are not quite there yet,” Martin said.  Martin further declined to comment on the recent suspension of talks that would have seen parent company Tera Group go public through a merger with MGT Capital Investments, stating only that today’s announcement was not connected to the hiring.  “They’re completely distinct events,” he said.  Market data  suggests MGT's stock rose sharply following the 27th February announcement from roughly $0.50 to a high of $0.80 before falling to a press time value of $0.38.

42398268,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT5Mw,1427132529,CEX.IO Cuts Bitcoin Trading Fees Amid Mining Market Woes,"CEX.IO is offering 0% trading fees for a short period of time as it renews its focus on the bitcoin exchange space, following the suspension of its GHash.io cloud mining contracts earlier this year.  The exchange, which currently charges a fixed 0.2% commission fee on all buy/sell transactions will cancel its trading fees for a one-week period, starting on 25th March.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Helga Danova, communications officer at CEX.IO, said:  ""To make new features available for as many people as possible, we have opened up our service and invite people to try out trading on CEX.IO with 0% fees.""  The free trading will cease on 1st April.  Heightened security  The move comes amid a series of company-wide improvements, including measures aimed at heightening security.  CEX.IO obtained a Level 3 PCI DSS certificate, according to Danova. The certificate is issued to help businesses process card payments securely and reduce fraud. To get the certificate, companies must introduce tight controls surrounding the storage, transmission and processing of cardholders' data.  CoinDesk contacted the PCI Security Standards Council for verification, but the organisation had not replied at the time of press.  Danova commented on the exchange's security priorities:  ""As we are approaching 400,000 users, it is our priority to make the exchange more secure and easy-to-use, launching new features and opening the world of bitcoin to newcomers in the crypto field.""  These attempts to enhance security come a couple of months after GHash.io was targeted, along with a number of bitcoin mining pools, by distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks.  At the time, CEX.io (which operated GHash.io) said the source of recent attacks on its pool came with increasing ransom demands.  Mining troubles  The exchange halted its cloud mining activities in January, with the company claiming that mining was no longer profitable and blaming declining revenue on bitcoin's decreasing price.  Prior to that, a number of miners opted to leave GHash.io's pool following a significant increase in its hash share. The mass-departure was based on the belief that a single entity controlling more than 50% of the network's computing power, could theoretically wreak havoc on the whole network.  Industrial bitcoin mining facility operator BitFury moved 1.5 petahash of its hashing power out of GHash's mining pool in June last year. At the time, Marc Aafjes, BitFury’s chief strategy and communications officer, suggested the company felt compelled to take action due to the widespread community concern, stating that ""the high level of combined hash power in the Ghash pool is concerning to many participants in the system"".  As a result of the controversy, GHash.io later agreed to limit its share of the total bitcoin network to 39.99% to avoid the associated threat of 51% attacks.  The decision was taken during the Bitcoin Mining Summit in July last year. The industry-wide event was organised by the controversial mining pool and involved representatives from notable bitcoin companies and members of the community.  Image via Shutterstock.

42395307,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASaHFt,1427109623,ChangeTip Integrates With Online Comment Hosting Service Disqus,"UPDATE (23rd March, 20:21 GMT): Comment from Disqus has been added.     Users of blog commenting service Disqus can now tip each other in bitcoin following the company's integration with San Francisco-based micropayments startup ChangeTip.  The news of the integration came after Victoria van Eyk, VP community developer at ChangeTip, sent a tip to a commenter on one of CoinDesk's articles.  The commenter had suggested Disqus should enable a bitcoin tipping option, to which van Eyk replied an integration between ChangeTip and Disqus had taken place recently.  The bitcoin tipping service responds to a system of bots, and passes on the message from the sender's wallet to that of the receiver after it ""hears"" its name mentioned across various social networks.  ChangeTip, which received $3.5m in funding in December, uses an internal ledger to process tips off-chain, meaning tips are sent almost instantly.  Steve Roy, VP of marketing at Disqus, said of the integration:  ""Disqus is a service that can be integrated with other popular web services. So it's quite common for us to enable an integration like this. We'll watch how this one evolves and adjust for it accordingly.""  Busy period  The announcement comes amid a seemingly busy period for the startup. Just a few days ago, ChangeTip announced its integration with video streaming platform Twitch.tv.  The company has also ventured into the donation micropayments space, having recently partnered with the non-profit BitGive Foundation.  Additionally, ChangeTip is supported by Twitter, Reddit, GitHub, Slackhttps://slack.com/r/029trbch-02g2fa60, Wordpress, Google+ and Tumblr.  Last month, bitcoin services provider Coinbase revealed it was shutting down its tipping button, citing ChangeTip's traction as the reason behind its decision. Coinbase announced it would direct the 10,000 users enrolled in its service to ChangeTip as of 1st April.
