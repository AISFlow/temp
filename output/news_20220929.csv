42393954,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brdE8N,1664494681,On Starting a Crypto Career in the Dead of Winter,"This week at CoinDesk we’ve been highlighting the growing number of university programs that focus on blockchains and cryptocurrency. College isn’t necessarily a requirement for a solid career in the field, but for most people it’s the surest first step.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Education Week.  But now may be a strange time to think about college, especially for those hoping for a career in crypto. After a two-year stretch of unprecedented hype, we’ve entered “crypto winter,” a recurring species of downturn that has proven typical of the blockchain industry as speculation outpaces adoption, then retreats.  The huge up-and-down cycles in crypto can certainly be nerve-wracking. And this time we’re also seeing signs of broader weakness in technology jobs, with a wave of headline-generating layoffs over the summer. It’s enough to make a young person second-guess career goals that had seemed like a slam dunk just a few months ago.  But recruiters with an eye on the tech world cite three good reasons learning about blockchain makes sense, even at a moment when it suddenly feels a bit less like The Next Big Thing.  First, the skills that will get you in the door in crypto can be transferred without too much difficulty to other technology spheres. Second, anyone trained in computer science or coding will have relatively solid job prospects in nearly any kind of economy. And third, in crypto as in most fields, a downturn can actually make the early stages of a career easier in some ways by creating more freelance or gig work opportunities.  Above all, job-hunting experts say it’s important to think long term, even when news of layoffs and a slowing economy make it tempting to throw in the towel before you’ve even started.  Understanding the downturn – and when it will end  “Unfortunately, there’s a lot of discussions about hiring freezes and layoffs and the recession,” says Rick Chen of the tech-job discussion site Blind.  Blind is an anonymized forum where verified employees speak freely about what they’re seeing at their workplaces and beyond, making it a very valuable source of job market insights. Chen is head of public relations at Blind, but he says most of his job is “being the in-house journalist” – watching the anonymous chatter on the site and extracting larger trends.  Chen says the looming economic downturn is causing particular worry for tech workers in three industries: real estate, fintech (including crypto) and the so-called gig economy. “People in corporate roles … at Instacart, Uber, Lyft. They’re concerned whether their business models are sustainable.”  But what’s behind the broad downturn in tech and crypto? In very broad strokes, COVID-19 is still in charge: Pandemic disruptions led to high inflation, and in turn central banks are raising interest rates both in the U.S. and worldwide.  That has a particularly sharp impact on so-called growth sectors of the economy, where companies often borrow money from investors to fund and market new ideas. When interest rates are higher that money tends to dry up because safer investments like bonds become relatively more attractive. That’s particularly worrying for companies like Uber that have been around for years but still show weak profitability and limited growth.  Crypto also falls very much in the growth category: While some crypto firms have strong revenue even during the current downturn, many rely on investor funds of one sort or another as they work towards broader adoption. Those funds have become more scarce, dropping by half between 2021 and the first half of 2022. That means the current job doldrums, in crypto and in tech more broadly, could end in a couple of different ways: either investment revives, or more revenue starts flowing from customers.  The good news is that, unlike Uber, crypto is still considered a big future opportunity, so investment is still flowing in – just more slowly than at the peak of the last bull market. And even now there are still jobs to be had.  “Despite this crypto winter, [blockchain firms] are still hiring,” says Chen. “No matter what, in terms of the state of the economy there are still some companies that need engineers, or need product managers. Those roles are kind of evergreen, so to speak.”  Tech is everywhere, and you can be, too  Josh Brenner, CEO of the job market Hired, agrees there are still plenty of opportunities in the tech sector as a whole, despite some high-profile layoff rounds.  “We started off the year with crazy aggressive hiring, and we’re now more at an efficient or stabilized kind of hiring for companies,” says Brenner. In many cases, the layoffs came from companies that were aiming to grow too fast and had to suddenly reverse course, rather than from companies that are shrinking or dying.

On the technical end of the spectrum, transferable skills come in basically two forms, according to Brenner. On the one hand there are specific programming languages or software tools that are used across a huge range of industries. A few of these are fairly consistent – learning Python, for instance, or how to manage a company’s Amazon Web Services. But Brenner recommends learners do their own research to figure out what skills are in demand, including searching job boards and monitoring the communities around specific coding languages.  On the other hand, says Brenner, “it’s the act of actually learning a new skill that companies look for.” In other words, the most important skill for employers may be the discipline and flexibility required to learn – which is very much the point of going to college.  That focus on basic skills extends to non-technical roles, where Brenner says good communication and organizational skills are paramount, “especially in this remote [work-from-home] world that most companies are going for now.” If you’re fascinated by blockchains and also a strong writer you have a lot of options, from technical copywriting to marketing.  Compared with technical roles, though, it is a bit harder to prove your chops as, say, an email copywriter. Especially for coders, there are increasing opportunities to pass skills tests or earn specific certifications that can get your foot in the door, even without a college degree. Brenner says Hired is working to provide parallel alternatives for communications or other roles, but “it’s a much tricker process” for so-called soft skills.  That suggests non-technical careers may benefit proportionally more from the credential of a college degree. But Brenner says more and more companies are making exceptions even for those roles, as long as you’ve found other ways to show how effective you can be.  “If you have a good track record,” says Brenner, “it’s more about your outputs and what you could produce versus where you went to school.”  The smooth on-ramp: contract work and DAOs  Undergraduate programs teaching blockchain and crypto skills have only really appeared within the last few years. That means crypto still offers a lot of non-traditional pathways for those looking to enter the industry, and they’ve recently become easier to access because of the rise of DAOs, or decentralized autonomous organizations.  DAOs are almost by their nature great places to explore a career in crypto, learn basic skills and build a track record. They often rely on short-term contracts, with workers assigned specific tasks for the DAO. That might include anything from writing text for a website to debugging contract code. Getting those gigs requires, above all, identifying projects you’re interested in and finding out where members gather and communicate (often, on an easily accessed Discord chat server).  Getting this sort of gig work is often a lot easier than getting hired for a full-time job because neither side is making a huge commitment. They can also be a perfect fit for students still learning the ropes while mostly focused on classes.  But once team members get to know you, DAO contributions can lead to a more formal role – including non-technical roles. In fact, as I was writing this piece, a small data point popped up on Twitter.  According to Zeugh, aka Ion Neto, he had been doing community management for JuiceboxDAO for about a year when the opportunity to take on a full-time role at another DAO came his way.  How a downturn can be good for freelancers  Though there are still happy stories like Zeugh’s, DAO contract opportunities have certainly been hurt by the economic and crypto-market downturn. DAOs are an exciting new frontier in the expanding blockchain universe, and largely rely on investor funds to operate. Those haven’t entirely dried up but they’ve definitely gotten scarcer.  “Many DAOs have entered into budget-reducing modes of various kinds,” says Spencer Graham. Graham is a core contributor at DAOHaus, a platform for community-driven DAOs. “Some DAOs have done the equivalent of laying off contributors, others have shifted to a constrained project-based budgeting approach, and most have decided to reduce per-contributor compensation as well.”  But there are upsides to the downturn, perhaps most importantly for those early in their careers or still in school.  “When companies are not hiring permanent workers, there is typically an increase in freelance opportunities,” says Hired’s Josh Brenner, “because those companies want to achieve the same work but need more flexibility in how they staff it.” This includes mainstream tech companies, and could mean that workers with less experience have more opportunities to add to their resumes.  The wintery downturn also offers some advantages for building a career in crypto specifically. With fewer Super Bowl commercials and Paris Hilton plugs, a lot of people briefly attracted to the surface hype tend to suddenly disappear from crypto. This can mean more opportunities for people attracted instead to the deeper goals and ideals of the crypto industry – things like financial inclusion and displacing surveillance capitalism.  Those deeper commitments are also a huge leg up for long-term and fulfilling success in the industry. In fact, looking inward and deciding precisely why you’re pursuing a crypto career may be the most important framework for planning ahead.  “The people who get into crypto are true believers,” says Blind’s Chen. “They have this kind of mental reward of working on building something new. And that’s a key motivator that might not exist if you worked at Goldman.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,David Z.

The price has been moving northward in the past week, with other top coins following suit. From the technicality outlook, the coin&apos;s current support zone has been between 6.25 and 6.35, respectively. As of writing, CoinMarketCap has shown the token trading at $6.35, enjoying a 12.07% weekly gain in value.

While it slipped below its mark during the week, it quickly bounced back, going up to $6.6 on Tuesday. Uniswap Price Analysis UNI was trading at $5.69 in the past week. The bulls have been constantly defeated at the resistant mark by other coins. Many believed that if Uniswap continued to witness fewer demands, it would lose most of Its gains. However, it surged in price in the last 24 hours and led to gains. If UNI eventually falls below the $6.29 level, it will be reduced to $6.00. This indicates the amount of bearishness it would be for the UNI. However, if it continues leading gains, trading will rise, and the buying strength will keep increasing. Moreover, the overhead resistance, for now, is at $6.29. Uniswap (UNI) Technical Analysis UNI has been increasing and decreasing in the trading rate due to the unstable value.

Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether and most other major altcoins sank more gently, offering the latest counterpoint in an ongoing debate whether digital assets will continue to correlate with equities, particularly from the tech sector. BTC was recently trading over $19,400, roughly where it stood 24 hours earlier after recovering from an early morning plunge.  ""Bitcoin’s correlation with tech stocks remains, but it isn’t breaking as bad as it has during most of this cycle,"" wrote Oanda Senior Market Analyst Edward Moya in an email, noting the tech heavy Nasdaq's steep decline Thursday and bitcoin's recent ability to tread near or above $19,000 support. ""It appears Wall Street believes crypto is close to the bottom and will become an attractive diversification strategy once the peak in Treasury yields is in place,"" Moya added.  Ether was recently trading just above $1,330, down a little more than a percentage point from the same time a day ago. Other major cryptos traded sideways, with a slight red tint. ATOM and UNI were down about 4% and 3%, respectively. But XRP and XLM were recently up approximately 7% and 6%, respectively. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures performance across a basket of cryptocurrencies, was up slightly to over 963.  Equities had a day to forget, with the Nasdaq off nearly 3% and the S&P 500 down more than 2% as investors cringed from the latest bond market tumult and a U.S. Commerce Department report confirming that the U.S. was in recession by the traditional definition of two consecutive quarters of negative gross domestic product (GDP). The yield for 10-year Treasurys increased to over 3.74%, not far off its highest settlement date this year, while two-year yields continue to hover well over 4%.  Markets also continued to wrestle with the newly installed British leadership's economic policy of tax cuts and expanded spending to pull the country from its current doldrums. Observers of the U.K. are concerned that the moves will exacerbate its high inflation.  Late Wednesday, Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Rostin Behnam said that CFTC-led regulation could have significant benefits for the crypto industry, including a potential boost to the price of bitcoin. “Bitcoin might double in price if there’s a CFTC-regulated market,” Behnam told attendees during a fireside chat at NYU School of Law.  Behnam's remarks underscored an increasingly widespread belief in the importance of crypto regulation.  In an appearance Thursday morning on CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program, Greg Johnson, the co-founder and CEO of investment adviser Rubicon Crypto, said that crypto would likely continue trading at its current levels until regulatory agencies can set clear guidelines. ""We're in a purgatory that probably isn't going to go away for some time,"" Johnson said. ""Nothing meaningful is going to change in the crypto markets until we get ... regulatory clarity. That is going to allow for the next wave of meaningful adoption.""  Johnson added that clear regulation would encourage traditional financial services firms to expand in the crypto space. ""We're ready to move when we start to see traditional broker dealers and institutions not just say we have clarity, but start to hire to include enterprise-wide training of digital assets, we start to see the series 24 exam include topics and questions on digital assets.""

OATA Hopes So  By Shaurya Malwa  SINGAPORE — Crypto project IOTA unveiled its Shimmer platform Wednesday during an official launch event during the Token 2049 conference here.  The launch comes amid a flurry of blockchain upstarts, each promising to be faster and cheaper than the previous one, and often attracting hordes of venture funding. This year alone has seen the formation of networks including Sui and Aptos, alongside Ethereum-based scaling networks such as Arbitrum and Optimism.  IOTA, which enjoys its own cult following, much like other networks, said Shimmer’s unveiling followed nearly two years of testing a product that will eventually be used to test core protocol improvements and feature upgrades to IOTA-based applications in a “live” environment.  That means Shimmer is no testnet, or a blockchain used solely for testing purposes, and would instead exist as a full-scale, separate blockchain with its own SMR tokens.  Shimmer brings with it a unique model that allows budding developers to release various tokens, such as non-fungible tokens (NFT), tokenized real-world assets and stablecoins natively on a layer 1, or base, network without fees.  This is unlike other networks wherein participants usually pay fees – ranging from a few pennies to as much as a few hundred dollars – to deploy their tokens or projects.  IOTA says that such a design serves as the foundational basis for Shimmer’s smart contract execution layer, which includes full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility. EVM broadly refers to an extensive database that holds all Ethereum's accounts and balances, atop which developers can create services and deploy decentralized applications (dapps).  Support for a multi-chain ecosystem  Eventually, the ShimmerEVM will allow developers from other EVM-compliant networks to access the Shimmer network using other networks, thus creating support for a multi-chain ecosystem.  Another key feature of the Shimmer network is support for bridgeless native asset transfers across the entire Shimmer ecosystem. Bridges refer to blockchain-based tools that allow users to transfer tokens between different networks. Such tools have been highly susceptible to exploits in the past year, including a $600 million attack on Ronin, a $200 million attack on Nomad and other similar exploits.  The SMR tokens were distributed to anyone staking IOTA tokens over a three-month period, with some 1.4 billion SMR generated from users staking IOTA. Some 181 million SMR were voted on by the community to the Shimmer Community Treasury (DAO), a community-governed entity that would independently fund community projects.  The launch of the ShimmerEVM chain is expected in the coming weeks on the basis of successful and adequate security tests.

42393938,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brdD8p,1664492981,Crypto Goes to College,"Soon after Tal Rabin joined the University of Pennsylvania in the fall of 2020 the computer and information sciences professor successfully convinced the institution to let her teach a dedicated blockchain engineering class.  “I had a class of 140, but I was restricted by the size of the room,” she said. “There were 200 students on the waiting list who didn't get in, so it was definitely received with a lot of excitement.”  This post is part of Education Week.  Despite the strong demand from students, Rabin, who specializes in cryptography, soon found the challenges that came with teaching such a broad subject with so few educational standards and course materials. With such a broad range of potentially relevant subjects to cover, Rabin says she often has to lean on the expertise of others.  “I invite all kinds of speakers to talk about things that I think are important for the blockchain but that I don't know about, such as law issues associated with blockchain, the [Securities and Exchange Commission], mining data, [non-fungible tokens] and art and things like that,” she said.  While interest in blockchain education is high, the courses that are available can vary significantly between institutions, and are often dependent on a small number of enthusiastic professors. “If I look around at courses that my friends are teaching, people are all teaching it from their vantage point,” said Rabin.  With minimal educational infrastructure – such as standards and certifications, even course materials and textbooks – to lean on, formal education in the blockchain space remains largely driven by individual professors. While they are occasionally supported by partnerships with blockchain native companies and foundations – such as Algorand Foundation, where Rabin serves as head of research – institutions of higher learning won’t be able to pump crypto graduates into the industry in significant numbers anytime soon. (In any case, only eight of 240 schools screened by CoinDesk for the Best Universities for Blockchain 2022 had an undergraduate major in blockchain.)  “It might still be a long way out, because what would such a credential include?” she said. “Would it include the foundations of the blockchain? Would it include understanding applications on top? Things are changing daily in this field, and it takes time for these things to mature.”  Enter Tradfi  Blockchain has long had a skills problem because adoption, investment and use cases have continually outpaced the availability of talent. Up until now the industry has been able to achieve significant growth relying on those who are self-taught and those they can train themselves, but that won’t be enough to bring the industry into the mainstream.  Though it’s still relatively early days some of the biggest names in finance – including JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs – are already betting big on blockchain. In fact, JPMorgan’s crypto team is already staffed by 200 full-time employees.  Blockchain has the potential to touch nearly every corner of the traditional financial industry, ranging from investment banks to private equity firms, hedge funds, law firms, payments providers and more. As a result, there will be a massive need for qualified talent with an equally broad range of blockchain-based skills throughout the sector in the years ahead.  As more traditional institutions look to grow their blockchain capabilities – and with it, their talent rosters – many are looking for some sort of educational standard. That is especially true in finance, a heavily regulated industry that has long had to maintain strict licensing and educational requirements for compliance reasons, and is accustomed to considering candidates in large part based on their formal education.  While some may fear the finance industry having an outsized influence on blockchain education, Rabin said its strongest promoters remain the blockchain-native startups, at least for now.  “At this point in time the people who are giving funds to universities to create educational programs are the blockchain companies, not the traditional financial industry, so at this point their voice is being heard more,” she said.  Up until quite recently, however, there was no such thing as formal education in blockchain, and what exists today is hardly sufficient to support a finance industry that is taking blockchain’s potential seriously, as many finally are.  The relatively young crypto industry, in near total contrast, has long prized those self-taught enthusiasts over those who descend from an ivory tower, in keeping with the decentralized, grassroots nature of the movement. That mentality, however, may soon be at risk of becoming a victim of its own success.  The self-taught pioneers of the field were so effective in convincing the rest of the world to take the space seriously that many traditional financial institutions are rapidly enhancing their blockchain capabilities and are hungry for talent; too hungry to rely on the self-taught talent pool alone. Now the market is calling for a more effective and universal education infrastructure that can help carry the industry into the future.  “There’s been a big step change in demand,” says Caroline Lo, a partner and co-leader of the financial services practice at True, a global executive talent search firm. “It started when a number of well-known hedge funds and business leaders stated that a significant portion of their wealth or [assets under managers] were in crypto; statements like that raised the bar of confidence that crypto is here to stay.”  Today, more than a third of traditional hedge funds invest in digital assets, according to a recent PwC report, and more than two-thirds intend to increase their holdings by the end of the year.  Lo, who spent 15 working for traditional financial institutions, says the heavily regulated industry is accustomed to hiring staff with a seal of approval from a trusted educational institution, or those who have at least passed a standard evaluation.  “For example, to become a salesperson selling derivatives you have to have achieved a certain level of knowledge in derivative understanding and risk profiles and know how the product is traded in order to sell it,” she said. “Anyone in the derivative market takes a similar test, whether they’re in London or Hong Kong or New York.”  Lo explains that while many in the industry are still curious about the technology and keen to expand their blockchain capabilities, they often can’t move as quickly as they would like because of the challenges associated with qualifying talent.  “What companies go through now when they're hiring at a junior or mid level is they have to go through more rounds of interviewing than they would for a non-crypto hire in order to build confidence and consensus that this person has the required skills,” she said.  Lo added that the task is made harder by the number of enthusiasts who are self-taught but not to a sufficient degree. She explained that many can talk the talk in an interview but it’s much harder to identify those who actually have the required skills.  “If there was some kind of understanding and certification that people could achieve, it would be very helpful to the industry,” she said. “It would set a bar for quality and confidence in the industry, which could help blockchain and crypto become more mainstream within financial services.”  For the meantime Lo said most are relying on their ability to up-skill existing staff or hire candidates with relevant education in adjacent fields. There also seems to be a preference for candidates who participate in on-campus blockchain clubs, and those with some prior work experience at blockchain-related startups. She is also seeing a lot of traditional financial institutions putting together teams that combine blockchain skills with experts from other disciplines when they struggle to find enough candidates with expertise in both areas.  “For example, where we see a lot of that activity is in building up teams in payments companies,” said Lo. “What a number of firms have had to do is put together a team where some people know payments and some people know crypto, but it’s been very hard to find anyone who knows crypto payments.”  What happens to the self-taught?  While the industry is calling for more regulation, educational standards and eventually a broadly accepted credential, Lo also said it's important to exercise caution, especially in such a new and fragile field. She, like many, fears what might happen if educational requirements become too stringent, or lead companies to dismiss those without a certain credential.  “You can go too far with something like that, especially in a market that is still very early but is hugely creative,” said Lo. “You need to make sure it's set the right way so that innovation is not stifled, but it allows for fantastically innovative and creative people to have an accreditation that recognizes them as being qualified to build, create and advise on crypto.”  A field that combines technology and finance striking a balance between the self-taught and the credentialed will be delicate but vital to enabling ongoing innovation. The tech industry itself has long welcomed the talented dropout on an equal playing field with the top-tier university graduate, but finance generally has a preference for one profile over the other.  If and when a broadly accepted credential is established, however, it could serve to limit the career opportunities of those without one.  Read more: Autodidacts Welcome!  Gina Pieters, an assistant instructional professor at the University of Chicago’s Department of Economics – which offers blockchain-specific undergraduate and graduate-level courses – isn’t concerned that more formal education will push out those who are self-taught, however. That is because she said the two are rarely competing for the same career opportunities; the self-taught tend to prefer working for (or starting) blockchain native companies, as opposed to working for more traditional institutions.  “It fulfills a slightly different niche,” she said. “People will continue self-studying, and we encourage that. I don't think we are replacing that, and I don't think it's a competing product.”  Pieters explained that students who are eyeing careers in blockchain-native companies and startups tend to take those courses out of personal interest. Those who are keen on applying for roles with traditional financial institutions, however, seem confident that even a limited educational background in the field will serve as an asset.  “If students want to go to J.P. Morgan or a traditional firm, they’ll think, ‘this might give me an edge,’” she said. “For them it’s adding an additional ability to talk about when they're interviewing.”  Those who are seeking jobs in major financial institutions after graduation believe that even listing a blockchain-related course on their résumé is an asset, given the demand for such skills and the limited credentialing that exists. “With the traditional firm going into the crypto space you see a far more traditional mindset in that regard,” she said.  At the same time Pieters doesn’t think those same candidates are taking job opportunities away from the self-educated. “The self-study students would prefer a job with a crypto [or blockchain-native] firm,” she said.  As of now the two worlds work well together, with both the formally educated and self-taught finding their own place within the industry. What she and others fear, however, is that the push to establish more formal educational standards and credentials could limit opportunities for those who are self-educated.  “If firms accept sub-standard workers simply because they have formal education, that's a failure,” she said. “At the same time there are people for whom the formal education system works well, and to say we should only accept self-study learners is also unfair.”",NEUTRAL,없음,ALGO | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jared Lindzon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/09/29/crypto-goes-to-college,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/686d1ea113fbbb01ee014acc49cdeb2886c47286-1792x1024.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394733,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASV3sZ,1664483713,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Showing Potential Signs of an Upswing,"Price Action  Bitcoin and ether declined on Wednesday as economic data confirmed that the U.S. has technically entered a recession.  Bitcoin’s (BTC) price recently fell 0.06% on moderate volume following Wednesday’s 1.8% increase. Prices fell sharply during the 12:00 UTC (8 a.m. ET) and 13:00 UTC (9 a.m. ET) time frames, coinciding with the announcement the U.S. economy contracted by 0.6% in the second quarter. Subsequent hours saw BTC regain ground.  Ether’s (ETH) price recently declined 0.28%. Its trading behavior was similar to BTC, selling off in early U.S. trading hours before reversing course slightly. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has declined in volatility as its average true range (ATR) has contracted 13% over the last seven days. ATR reflects volatility by measuring the spread between an asset’s high, low and closing prices.  TheCoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures performance across a basket of cryptocurrencies, declined by 1.35%  Economic Calendar: U.S. economic activity contracted by 0.6% in the second quarter, confirming that, technically, the United States has entered a recession, at least by the common definition of “two consecutive quarters of negative GDP.”  The U.S. Commerce Department’s data release corroborated economic data announced on Aug. 25, so it isn’t new market information.  The U.S. gross domestic price index rose 9.1% to a record 126.31 points, which adds fuel to the inflation narrative that has largely dominated markets.  Personal consumption expenditures (PCE), an index that measures price changes in consumer goods and services, increased 7.3% against expectations of 7.1%. Real consumer spending, a measure of personal consumption, rose 2% versus estimates of a 1.5% increase.  Corporate profits rose 6.2%, rebounding from a decline of 2.5% in the prior quarter.  U.S. Equities: Traditional equities declined. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), tech-heavy Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 fell 1.5%, 2.8% and 2%, respectively.  Commodities: In energy markets, the price of WTI crude decreased 0.74% while European Brent crude and natural gas fell 0.7% and 0.8%, respectively. In metals, safe-haven asset gold fell 0.04%, while copper futures increased 2.1%.  Latest Prices  ● Bitcoin (BTC): $19,435 −0.8%        ● Ether (ETH): $1,336 −0.9%        ● CoinDesk Market Index (CMI): $958 −0.3%        ● S&P 500 daily close: 3,640.47 −2.1%        ● Gold: $1,669 per troy ounce +0.5%        ● Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 3.75% +0.04        Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Technical Take  Bitcoin showing early signs of an uptrend  Recent trading data is showing bitcoin’s price is beginning to register a series of “higher lows,” laying the groundwork for the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization to begin rising again.  A higher low signals that the present day’s low price is higher than the previous low price for an asset. When this occurs, it signals that more buyers are willing to acquire an asset at progressively higher prices. BTC’s price is 7% higher than the low of $18,157 made on Sept. 21, and has made higher lows in six of the next nine trading days.  The other element of an emerging uptrend would be a series of “higher highs,” which has not occurred to the same degree. From the identical starting point (Sept. 21), BTC made higher highs in just three of the next nine trading days.  Bullish investors may potentially take this development with other indicators to advance their narrative. Using Sept. 21 as an anchor point shows that the relative strength index indicator over the same time period increased by 27%. RSI is a technical indicator often used as a proxy for price momentum.  Bitcoin has also been outperforming a number of its peers recently, most notably ether, whose price peaked on Sept. 8 and has declined 19% since then. BTC has recently outperformed Cardano’s ADA, XRP and Polygon’s MATIC, implying that bitcoin remains the asset of choice for investors seeking digital asset exposure.  Neutral to bearish investors are likely viewing the recent development relative to its current “point of control.” An asset’s point of control represents an area of high price activity over time. It essentially indicates where significant price agreement occurs, and is often used to indicate support or resistance.  BTC’s current point of control is approximately $20,300 when looking back to the start of 2022, just 5.4% higher than its current price.  While BTC looks poised to move higher, there also appears to be concerns that it will soon hit resistance near $20,000.

Read more: Bitcoin City: El Salvador’s Dreams for Utopia on Hold  Despite the volatile crypto market, Mallers said he doesn’t think it is “hurting bitcoin’s opportunity as a store of value.” He also said he does not think volatility in bitcoin hinders its underlying technology from being used as a payment rail that can compete with payment behemoths like Visa and Western Union.  Mallers said the benefits that can come with using the Bitcoin network layer 2 protocol Lighting Network, including faster and cheaper transactions, is “a groundbreaking innovation.” Strike customers currently use the underlying payments system for the transfer of fiat currency, and Mallers expects the use of bitcoin to pick up dramatically over time.  “You have a digital instrument that can move at the speed of light and settle at virtually no cost,” Mallers said. Bitcoin “does something that payment networks have never been able to do in the history of payment networks.”  Strike most recently raised $80 million in a Series B funding round that included such notable institutions as Washington University and the University of Wyoming.  Funds raised will be used “to work with the biggest institutions in the world,” according to Mallers, who said the goal is “to get them onto the payment rail.”  Read more: Jack Mallers’ Crypto Payment Firm Strike Raises $80M",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/09/29/strike-ceo-el-salvadors-bitcoin-experience-doesnt-hurt-my-company-at-all,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/46bec6616bc63967bed8b59b7f6a532202b0b009-5184x3888.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The state has been wrestling with a number of cryptocurrency proposals, and though Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a crypto licensing and regulation bill this week – seen as a possible West Coast version of New York's BitLicense – he approved another on Wednesday that instructs county records offices to allow for the use of blockchain technology and verifiable credentials. The technology would be established in the distribution of birth, death and marriage records, allowing PDFs to be sent immediately rather than using a typical 10-day postal delivery.  The bill, introduced by California state Sen. Robert Hertzberg, represents a test of blockchain in an essential governmental function in the most populous U.S. state.  “This secure and highly convenient process will allow the average person to access their vital records and shows California is still leading the way for innovation,” Hertzberg said in a statement to CoinDesk on Thursday.  When arguing the merits of the bill to the Senate last month, Hertzberg said this is “not only a faster, cheaper, and more efficient delivery method, saving Californians both time and money, but it is also much more secure as blockchain is nearly impossible to hack.”  Also, this week in the U.S. Senate a bill to set up a governmental task force on digital identity cleared the Senate Homeland Security committee. The legislation – also reflected by a similar effort in the House – is meant to advance work at the federal and state levels toward setting up interoperable, government-approved digital identities. The Bank Policy Institute said the effort “would improve security and enhance customer convenience.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/29/california-moves-forward-to-allow-vital-records-to-be-issued-on-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7992db294ebdcdc69b561a8bccdab3f5a4a0c44a-2719x2103.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42411352,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNI9P,1664478281,How to Stop Illegal Activity on Tornado Cash (Without Using Sanctions),"Did the U.S. government have better tools at its disposal to counter the crimes on Tornado Cash than the one it eventually used? Could it have avoided the blunt instrument of sanctions, which are normally aimed at individuals rather than code?  In August, decentralized obfuscation tool Tornado Cash (a currency “mixer”) was designated by U.S. authorities as a sanctioned entity. In the years prior Tornado had become the default platform for blockchain users – both licit and illicit – for privacy in transactions.  Users deposit their ether(ETH) into any of Tornado’s 0.1, 1, 10 or 100 ETH pools, then wait for a period of time to withdraw it. Thanks to this collaborative placing of ether into the same pot, which disguises its origins, and Tornado's innovative use of zero-knowledge proofs the trail is broken.  J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.  The crypto community was furious with the U.S. government. The need for privacy is especially pressing on blockchains because all transactions are viewable by the public. Without Tornado to mix funds, achieving blockchain privacy becomes much more complicated.  Sanctions or not, it's hard to deny that the authorities had to do something about Tornado-based money laundering. Tremendous amounts of dirty money were being cleaned by the mixer, including big batches of funds stolen during the $182 million Beanstalk hack, the $196 million BitMart exploit and the $34 million compromise of Crypto.com, just to name a few.  To make matters worse, in April 2022 North Korean state-sponsored hacker group Lazarus began to use Tornado to launder the proceeds of its massive $625 million hack of the Ronin Bridge. Lazarus was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in 2019.  OFAC is the U.S. federal government agency responsible for enforcing economic sanctions programs against countries and groups of individuals. Its targets include terrorists, narcotics traffickers and money launderers, among others.  Although the U.S. government’s response to Tornado Cash could have taken many forms, the one it ultimately chose was to sanction Tornado Cash itself. On Aug. 8, Tornado was listed by OFAC as a Specially Designated National, or SDN, along with all of the smart contracts that drive the tool’s functionality. It is illegal for U.S. citizens to interact with SDNs, so in that very instant Tornado Cash’s Ethereum-based smart contracts became off-limits for Americans.  See also: The Problem Tornado Cash Raises About Base Layer Censorship on Ethereum | Opinion  The pushback to the U.S. government’s decision arrived immediately. According to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a nonprofit that promotes internet civil liberties, Tornado Cash smart contracts are code. By sanctioning code the authorities are treading on constitutionally protected freedom of speech.  Coin Center, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit that advocates for decentralized computing technologies, argued that OFAC had overstepped its authority. According to its rules, OFAC can only target entities that are individuals or companies. But Tornado Cash smart contracts are neither; they cannot alter their behavior, nor lodge an appeal with OFAC to have the sanctions revoked, a key element in any sanctioning process.  If OFAC can designate Tornado Cash to be an SDN, the implication is that it can add other defenseless open-source software tools, too – hardly a great precedent.  Don’t penalize code, penalize users of code  The criticisms aired by EFF and Coin Center are serious ones. Let's imagine the U.S. government had a chance to do things over. Rather than sanctioning Tornado Cash smart contracts, did the government have alternative tools available for countering Tornado-based money laundering, tools that avoided triggering these criticisms?  Yes. Rather than punishing code, penalize the people who use the code. There are three types of Tornado Cash users who could be targeted by the authorities: relayers, liquidity providers and the Ethereum-rich.  Let’s start with relayers, the people who add a key layer of privacy to Tornado Cash by processing withdrawals.  Relayers solve the following problem. If someone wants to remove mixed funds from Tornado to a new wallet address, he or she needs to pay a gas fee for the withdrawal, and so the new wallet must have some funds on it. But prefunding may compromise anonymity because this transaction can be traced.  Tornado Cash creators solved the prefunding problem by introducing third-party relayers who pay the necessary gas fees, sending on the user's withdrawal to the new address. These relayers collect a service charge for their efforts.  Highlighting the importance of relayers, over 75% of all Tornado Cash withdrawals are made with their intermediation.  The U.S. government needn’t put a blanket ban on code. It has a more nuanced, user-centric approach at its disposal.  In addition to going after relayers, the authorities could target liquidity providers.  Liquidity providers are people who use Tornado Cash to earn a profit. They deposit ether into various Tornado pools in order to receive anonymity points, which in turn can be sold for TORN, Tornado's native token.  After this points-based incentive scheme was introduced in late 2020, the quantity of ether deposited into Tornado's mixing pools began to grow exponentially. These deposits, often referred to as the tool's anonymity set, improved Tornado’s ability to anonymize funds. The deeper the anonymity set, the easier it is for users to hide.  Law enforcement could investigate relayers and liquidity providers and charge them with money laundering, a criminal offense. The case can be made that by indiscriminately forwarding mixed ether, relayers conduct transactions involving criminally derived funds. As for liquidity providers, they profit financially by widening Tornado’s anonymity set, which abets criminals in their efforts to hide their financial trails.  Because blockchains are transparent, it’s likely that relayers and liquidity providers would have been aware that criminals and SDNs were using Tornado Cash. Thus they knowingly offered their services.  See also: Tornado Cash Ban Will Aid China’s AI Goals | Opinion  Along with a money laundering offense, federal prosecutors could potentially indict relayers and liquidity providers for using Tornado Cash to provide money transmission services to those without such a license.  Alternatively, relayers and liquidity providers could be sanctioned, fined or charged by OFAC.  Relayers and liquidity providers are individuals, not code. And so arresting or sanctioning them wouldn't trigger the code-is-speech criticism raised by EFF. And since these users have agency, they can defend themselves against their accusations, addressing Coin Center’s concerns.  At the same time, by targeting relayers and liquidity providers the U.S. government would achieve its goal of reducing Tornado-based money laundering. A successful prohibition of relayers would have made it easier to link depositors with withdrawn funds, thereby making Tornado Cash less able to hide criminally-derived funds.  Targeting liquidity providers would reduce Tornado Cash’s anonymity set, the effect being to reduce criminals’ capacity to launder funds through it.  If pursuing liquidity providers and relayers doesn’t crimp Tornado-based money laundering, the authorities could have gone after the Ethereum-rich: large licit owners of ether who regularly interact with Tornado Cash’s 100 ETH pool to get privacy.  The authorities have a number of tools to target the Ethereum-rich, but one of the best tools would be OFAC’s civil monetary sanctions.  U.S. citizens who regularly make large deposits to Tornado Cash’s 100 ETH pool could be named by OFAC and fined a suitably large amount of money. OFAC could argue that by putting their ether into the 100 ETH pool at the same time as Lazarus Group, the Ethereum-rich enabled the laundering of Lazarus’ funds and thus ran afoul of OFAC’s 2019 sanctions on the group.  OFAC civil monetary sanctions have been used before on crypto users. BitPay, a bitcoin payment service provider, had to pay a $500,000 fine for allowing individuals in sanctioned locations like North Korea, Sudan, Iran and Syria to transact.  Since civil fines are levied on Tornado users, and not the code, the concerns raised by EFF and Coin Center are addressed. And fined individuals would be free to appeal their punishment.  By signaling to the public that depositing funds into Tornado Cash is prohibited, the fines would encourage the Ethereum-rich to avoid Tornado. Tornado's anonymity set would get smaller, making the tool less capable of cleaning large transactions from SDNs and thieves.  A recipe for dealing with future smart contract crime  Like them or not, OFAC's sanctions appear to have worked, up to a point.  In an effort to avoid penalties, the public has mostly stopped using Tornado smart contracts. The amount of ether in Tornado Cash pools has plunged by 61% from 225,000 to just 89,000. As a result, Tornado-facilitated money laundering has taken a hit. The mixer wasn’t even used to launder the proceeds of the $160 million Wintermute exploit, the biggest hack since the Aug. 8 sanctions.  This same result could have been achieved by targeting the users of the code, like relayers, rather than the code itself. It would have taken the authorities more time and effort. But many of the thorny criticisms that a direct outlawing of code are now attracting would have been sidestepped.  It's too late now for Tornado Cash. But the next time a set of smart contracts gets mobbed by bad actors, the U.S. government needn’t put a blanket ban on code. It has a more nuanced, user-centric approach at its disposal.",NEUTRAL,ETH,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MINING,JP Koning,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/09/29/how-to-stop-illegal-activity-on-tornado-cash-without-using-sanctions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/422d80cbd30c3099d5ea8760e34b3517e90a0503-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The potential sale of stablecoins is scheduled for a hearing on Oct. 6 in New York.  The company – whose CEO, Alex Mashinksy, resigned this week – “currently owns [11] different forms of stablecoin totaling approximately $23 million,” according to its Sept. 15 request.  Also on Thursday, the U.S. Trustee in the bankruptcy case appointed an independent examiner to investigate Celsius’ financial management that led the firm to file for bankruptcy.

42411354,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNICi,1664472004,Breaking Down the SEC and CFTC’s Autumn Wave of Enforcement Actions,"Fall is here, and U.S. financial regulators are well on their way to making this the worst season for criminal enforcement yet. Every year at this time, due to budgetary considerations and perhaps quotas to fill, agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Department of Justice (DOJ) ramp up their enforcement against crypto’s alleged bad actors.  In September 2019, you may remember, the SEC and CFTC sued and settled with the perpetrators of EOS, the largest ($4 billion) initial coin offering of all time. In December 2020, the SEC announced it was building a case against Ripple Labs. and that two of its executives had supposedly held illegal token sales totaling over $1 billion. And every year, a slew of cases are brought against lower-profile crypto projects – for any number of reasons.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  “The SEC & CFTC end their fiscal year on September 30, so this is their last chance to score big wins they can highlight in their budget requests to Congress,” Jake Chervinsky, head of policy at the Blockchain Association, tweeted. (He’s made the point before.)  This year is no different. Within the past 10 days at least three lawsuits were filed against crypto projects. One company was accused of market manipulation, a crypto influencer was charged with failing to report income and there’s even a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) thrown into the mix.  The SEC is often accused of regulating through enforcement rather than issuing clear guidance. While the accused projects mentioned are comparatively small, each enforcement has a legal wrinkle that analysts think could set a dangerous precedent. It seems as though in the mad dash to file cases before the end of the fiscal year, mistakes can be made.  Last week, the CFTC sued the company and founders behind the bXz protocol for allegedly enabling unregulated derivatives trading. The founders of the project settled with the agency, which, in something of a first, is also suing the Ooki DAO that was spun off to run the protocol. The trouble here is that the CFTC could be putting a bullet in the idea of “decentralizing” away governance of protocols and potentially criminalizing DAO participation.  See also: Interpreting the CFTC’s Lawsuit Against Ooki DAO  Another case charges crypto influencer Ian Balina with allegedly failing to disclose income from a 2018 initial coin offering (ICO) called SPRK. The facts of the case are almost irrelevant, compared with the SEC’s justification for filing it. Buried in the court document is an argument that because Ethereum nodes “are clustered more densely in the United States than in any other country,” the SEC should complete oversight on everything that happens on the network.  See also: ICO Promoter Ian Balina Charged With Violating Federal Securities Laws  “Rather than take on a simple case, the SEC is trying to use this to set precedent claiming that ALL OF CRYPTO is under SEC’s jurisdiction,” Adam Cochran, partner at Cinneamhain Ventures, in Canada, said on Twitter. “This is an absolutely unacceptable overstep that will have to be pushed back against aggressively.”  Finally, on Wednesday, the SEC accused fintech firm Hydrogen Technology Corp. and its former CEO, Michael Ross Kane, of unlawfully manipulating “crypto asset securities.” Hydrogen used a few methods to disperse its tokens, including an airdrop and a bounty program for those willing to shill the HYDRO token.  The complaint further alleges that Kane and Hydrogen hired a South Africa-based firm, Moonwalkers Trading, to use bots to create “the false appearance of robust market activity.” HYDRO’s market cap sits under $500,000. The SEC's release alleges that Hydrogen ""reaped profits of more than $2 million as a result of the defendants’ conduct.""  Both the accusation of an unregistered securities offering and market manipulation are run-of-the-mill activities in the world of altcoins. What’s different, and legally worrisome, about the Hydrogen case is the unclear language around the airdrop and rewards program.  “Companies cannot avoid the federal securities laws by structuring the unregistered offers and sales of their securities as bounties, compensation or other such methods,” said Carolyn Welshhans, the associate director of the SEC’s Enforcement Division.  “They say airdrops meet the Howey test’s ‘investment of money’ prong, even if no one makes an investment and no money changes hands,” Chervinsky tweeted, referring to a U.S. Supreme Court decision that spelled out how to define a “security.” Other lawyers noted the airdrop wasn’t “within the scope of the [SEC’s] actual Howey analysis” and the complaint seemed instead to focus on the promotional scheme.  Tyler Ostern, the CEO of Moonwalkers, agreed to pay back $36,750 in illicit gains from his bot army, and will face other civil penalties to be determined by a court. Kane, however, intends to fight the case.  “Just remember, SEC settlements are not settled law,” Chervinsky said. That may be true, but these actions also send a message and may have a chilling effect.

42411356,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNIMd,1664469149,"Ethereum’s Merge Was a Public Policy Miracle, so When Is the Congressional Hearing?","A public policy miracle happened two weeks ago and we should not let it pass quietly just because it went smoothly.  Ethereum, one of the most popular blockchains on the planet, reduced its energy consumption by about 99% and increased its cyber resilience by overhauling the way network participants validate transactions – a milestone called “The Merge.”  Now, instead of using about as much energy as all the televisions and computers in America combined annually (100 billion kilowatt hours, according to the Biden administration), Ethereum will use as much energy on an annual basis as Gibraltar, which has just 30,000 residents, all while supporting billions of dollars worth of transactions daily.  Jared A. Favole is a senior director of communications and policy at Circle, the principal operator of USD coin (USDC).  Instead of continuing to use a proof-of-work consensus mechanism, where high-end computers perform and solve energy-intensive mathematical proofs to validate transactions, Ethereum now uses a proof-of-stake model. Using proof-of-stake means network participants will instead deposit ether, the native token of Ethereum, as collateral to validate transactions. (The process to “mine” or validate transactions on the Bitcoin network still uses proof-of-work.)  The Merge is a great example of the benefits of blockchain technology. If we want better, cheaper, faster and programmable payments, constantly upgradable financial infrastructure will get us there.  The Merge also has important public policy implications that deserve attention, such as how to regulate decentralized organizations that do not have headquarters and/or employees like a traditional corporation.  The Merge could not have come at a more critical time for the blockchain and digital assets industry. The digital asset economy has lost about $2 trillion in value this year, several companies have filed for bankruptcy and a once-popular synthetic derivative that was supposed to have a stable price melted down in dramatic fashion.  See also: How the Ethereum Merge Could Lead to Improved On-Chain Privacy | Opinion  All of this is forcing lawmakers in the U.S., not to mention globally, to act with a sense of urgency. On Sept. 16, multiple executive branch agencies in the U.S. released a wave of reports as part of the Biden Administration’s Executive Order on digital assets – most of which highlighted the risks of digital assets, including to the environment.  Congress is actively considering a range of bills that would regulate nearly every aspect of blockchain technology. Executive branch agencies, notably the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), are jockeying for oversight of the industry.  And yet, judging by the early reaction from lawmakers, Ethereum’s Merge is going largely unnoticed despite climate change and cybersecurity being global priorities. At a hearing on digital assets two weeks ago that started just hours after Ethereum successfully transitioned to proof-of-stake, members of Congress spent hours grilling SEC Chairman Gary Gensler on, among other topics, climate change and digital assets. The Merge did not come up.  At another hearing on the same day, where members pressed CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam on a range of topics, proof-of-stake was discussed, thanks to some questions from Sens. Corey Booker (D-N.J.) and John Boozman (R-Ariz.), but only briefly.  See also: A Call to the SEC: Treat Crypto Assets as if Clients Matter | Opinion  This is surprising because the energy used by Bitcoin and Ethereum has been a central concern of lawmakers. The House Energy and Commerce Committee held a hearing on the topic earlier this year titled, “Cleaning Up Cryptocurrency: The Energy Impacts of Blockchains.” On the same day as the Merge, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen detailing environmental concerns associated with crypto. The letter referenced nine earlier letters she has penned raising concerns about digital assets, but Ethereum’s Merge nor proof-of-stake was not mentioned in any of them – even though Ethereum’s transition has been years in the making.  The White House did tout the benefits of proof-of-stake in its recent report “Climate and Energy Implications of Crypto-assets in the United States,” but a few mentions in one report is not enough to make up for the lack of attention from policymakers to Ethereum’s Merge. So I encourage lawmakers to hold a hearing about the benefits of having constantly upgradable financial infrastructure like Ethereum.  Right now, the U.S. government is focusing mostly on regulating through enforcement. But if we are only going after bad actors and bad actions, how much can we learn? Yes, bad actors deserve no home, but real policymaking leads to repeatable processes from which entrepreneurs can innovate, create jobs and support the U.S. economy.  It is notable that the Merge was unprompted by any regulations. But some essential questions deserve attention: What can we learn from the Merge that others can copy? What does it mean to have payment rails that can be upgraded quickly instead of over decades? What does it say about the process of generating good public policy outcomes? Was the negative attention lawmakers gave to the environmental concerns of blockchain technology enough to effect change?  It is unclear. What is clear is that the Merge is a great example of the benefits of blockchain technology. Imagine if the credit bureaus, which have been subject to multiple hacks exposing millions of people’s critical personal information, overnight instituted a change to make their business dramatically more cyber resilient as Ethereum is now because of the Merge? Or if a major credit card network instituted a change to make transactions 99% less energy intensive? Lawmakers would surely cheer them on.  I am sure lawmakers will hail the years-long introduction of FedNow, the government’s proposed real-time payments network. It is expected to be launched next year. While it does nothing to reduce energy consumption, it is expected to lead to the same sort of real-time payments already available over public blockchains like Ethereum.  The scrappy, decentralized developers who coordinated online to make the Merge such a success have pointed a way forward that we need to study. Public blockchains like Ethereum are the payment rails of the future and are nimble enough to change to fit society’s needs. Congress should not just hold hearings when something goes wrong.  As a society, we should learn from our mistakes. But we should learn from our successes, too.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jared Favole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/09/29/ethereums-merge-was-a-public-policy-miracle-so-when-is-the-congressional-hearing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f16de6ad9170a330b50f396595696f503c8420f4-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393937,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brdD3h,1664463682,Who What Wearables: A Guide to Digital Fashion and the Metaverse,"New York Fashion Week is often described as a sensory experience. While attending shows you’ll hear the thud of bass-heavy music as models in well-tailored ensembles parade along the runway, the air thick with the scents of new money and luxury fragrance. If you’re well-connected, you’ll be able to interact with designers and try on garments, touching luxe denims, velvets, cottons and silks remixed into every hue and combination.  While established names often dominate NYFW and set the season’s trends, this year’s event embraced new players who showcased not only physical designs, but also digital expressions of creativity played out across mediums.  At NYFW’s Nolcha Shows, blockchain gaming ecosystem Chain Guardians took up space next to traditional designers, displaying their “phygital” (physical and digital) take on classic designs. In their collection, a colorful, anime-style bodysuit included an NFC chip that, when scanned, linked to a non-fungible token (NFT) that is wearable in the Chain Guardians metaverse.  Trying on one of their garments meant not only physically putting it on my body, but also interacting with it inside the brand’s virtual storefront using a virtual reality (VR) headset. Picking up a pair of digital Chain Guardian shoes with the handheld VR controllers, the patent leather was shiny, just as it would be in real life.  After taking off the headset and looking out over the Manhattan skyline from the 69th floor of the towering 3 World Trade Center building, I noticed a large sticker on one of the windows that read “Web3 Looks Good on You.”  So, what exactly does Web3 look like?  To fashion and beyond  Megan Kaspar, managing director of Web3 venture capital firm Firstlight and founding member of digital fashion house Red DAO, has been a pioneer in blockchain-based digital wearables Web3 styling. In October 2021 she “wore” three pieces from DRESSX - a multi-brand retailer of digital-only clothing, NFT fashion items and augmented reality (AR) looks - on a Yahoo! Finance news segment using AR filters. In January, she had nine digital Fendi pieces tailored and transposed onto a photo of herself for the cover of a Haute Living issue.  “As we move to a reality where device disruption keeps occurring in the near term…that will come with the use of more digital fashion,” Kaspar told CoinDesk.  She defines digital fashion as having five major use cases at present.  First, there are digital-only garments sold as NFTs that are meant to be worn in the metaverse. This form of digital fashion was embraced by Tommy Hilfiger, Dolce & Gabbana, Forever 21 and dozens more designers who released full collections on metaverse platform Decentraland during the first-ever Metaverse Fashion Week in March.  The next is AR photo filters, which Kaspar used in her appearance on Yahoo! Finance. These filters are often used to create overlays on social media platforms like Snapchat, Instagram and TikTok, and can easily be integrated into live videos or photos. The third example is digital tailoring, meaning that after a real-life photo is taken, digital garments can be fixed onto a user’s photo, which is how Kaspar flexed Fendi on her Haute Living magazine cover.  Lastly, Kaspar notes that people can also view digital fashion as investable assets - whether that means purchasing NFT garments as speculative assets, such as a pair of NFT sneakers to resell for a profit. Alternatively, investors who purchase a rare digital designer handbag can prove their ownership over the asset on the blockchain.  Kaspar says that while many people view digital fashion as speculative investments for now, she believes that a “pretty viable solution” for mass adoption of these technologies will be created within five years.  Beyond utility  In addition to the many use cases digital fashion currently serves, a handful of emerging brands are turning to the technology to help solve many of the problems plaguing the fashion industry.  Sustainability  One issue the fashion industry faces is the production of fast fashion, which has nearly doubled within the last two decades. Current fashion consumption trends result in large amounts of textile waste, much of which is sent to landfills, burned or sent to developing countries. In addition, it was estimated in 2019 textile production creates more than 1.2 billion tons of greenhouse gasses per year, larger than all international flights and maritime shipping combined.  While there are still concerns about emerging technologies like NFTs and their environmental impact due to energy consumption, some up-and-coming designers have found ways to use NFTs to tackle issues of overproduction and overconsumption of clothing. Notably, the Merge, Ethereum’s transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms earlier this month, is expected to reduce the network’s energy use by over 99% and make most NFT transactions more efficient.  KRWN Studio, a digitally-native, small-batch fashion brand that sells virtual streetwear as NFTs, aims to make fashion greener by manufacturing garments on the blockchain.  “My experience in the fashion world and what I was exposed to is extremely unsustainable and very corrupt,” KRWN CEO Amina Mehti told CoinDesk. “[KRWN Studio] is not using fabrics, we're not using textiles…what we as creators can do is offset [emissions].”  Digitally native brands that adopt a phygital model take on some of the environmental responsibility related to manufacturing, including the physical production of garments alongside minting digital replicas as NFTs. However, many recognize how they can scale operations and mindfully release products in small batches to avoid mass production.  Footwear manufacturer Shoes 53045 seeks to offset its environmental load by releasing two pairs of metaverse-ready NFT sneakers for every physical pair they produce. Co-founder and CEO Aurelia Ammour told CoinDesk that sustainability is an important part of the company’s mission, and it stays true to this mission by utilizing limited-edition drops, 3D printing in its manufacturing and minting NFTs on proof-of-stake blockchains like Ethereum to limit mining-associated carbon emissions.  “We make shoes that last and that are collectible, so [sustainability] is very important to us,” Ammour told CoinDesk.  Self-expression and accessibility  Digital wearables provide users with tools for self-expression and are often used to adorn an avatar or another manifestation of a digital identity. Metaverse Fashion Week, for example, was fueled by a desire for self-expression and individuality online.  Tokyo White, a luxury fashion house focused on NFTs, aims to be a vehicle for digital identity. From clothing for metaverse avatars fit for a variety of occasions to AR filters that allow users to try on items, founder Toyko White told CoinDesk that digital design allows for greater freedom and creativity.  “You can be whatever you want to be depending on the metaverse that you go into…I think it's just an extension of what our minds are able to do in fashion,” White told CoinDesk.  Digital fashion also makes the industry more accessible for producers and consumers alike. NFTs make it easier for a designer to get their pieces out to the public and provide a broader range of prices for consumers.  Web3 wearables marketplace The Dematerialised (DMAT) prides itself on using blockchain technology to fix the mistakes of other retail giants. Co-founder Karinna Nobbs told CoinDesk that DMAT prioritizes accessibility and hopes to set a standard for future digital fashion houses.     “Whether crypto native or non-crypto native, people should be able to access digital fashion and NFTs. For us to have a luxury and an aspirational aesthetic, but to be able to have accessibility at different economic points, is really important,” Nobbs told CoinDesk.  The supply chain, on-chain  Digital wearables created on the blockchain give buyers many advantages that physical goods can’t. From the moment an NFT is minted, its entire lifespan can be publicly traced.  For the fashion industry, this solves many of the hurdles involved in creating garments. Zino Haro, CEO of Web3 wearable collective Uni-ke, told CoinDesk that minting garments on a public blockchain ledger fosters better trust in the brand and creates a better customer experience.  “What we ultimately want to do in the supply chain is have transparency of where everything is coming from, which would be good for the end consumer.”  Blockchain transparency also benefits secondary market resale, specifically for luxury goods.  Second-hand designer retailer The Real Real has strict guidelines for identifying counterfeit items before listing them to the public, a process that could likely be automated by blockchain technology.  Vivien Zhang, the founder of Web3 fashion marketplace The Spot Room, supports phygital brands in minting their items on-chain. Through implanting chips in physical items that are redeemable as an NFT, all of the data linked to the asset exists on-chain, making verification easier.  ""We incorporate an NFC tag, which holds all the info and certification associated with the physical product, safeguarding the resale value for any item. Not only do we facilitate peer-to-peer transactions but our end-to-end solution also gives royalty to the creators of the products or items,"" Zhang told CoinDesk.  The runway to mass adoption  For designers and creators in digital spaces, the boundaries of what fashion is and who is invited to club continue to grow. Beyond blocky 8-bit creations, the digital fashion landscape is vast and spans platforms and mediums.  In order for digital fashion to permeate throughout the crypto space and beyond, Kaspar aims to onboard as many people as possible by highlighting the many forms and faces of digital fashion.  She told CoinDesk that the majority of investors are looking past this when it comes to digital fashion. “[They’re] not yet seeing the power of ownership, identity and data inside of this new ‘to-earn’ economy that's gonna spur out of digital fashion because they don't quite yet see how it's used.”  “You need more investment, more designers, more people participating in building around the technology so it can really get out there,” added Kaspar.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | AR,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/09/29/who-what-wearables-a-guide-to-digital-fashion-and-the-metaverse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/86c01685781df5bef46763c24cee3209ec975410-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to the KazInformation correspondent, deputy Ekaterina Smyshlyaeva made a statement about it. Introduction of First Draft Legislation Smyshlyaeva introduced the proposed legislation. Normative-legal acts are needed to control crypto mining within Kazakhstani territory. The legislation of crypto mining, along with the lack of additional regulation of cryptocurrency manufacturers, has resulted in the unregulated growth of the energy consumption business.

42394511,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bw973Z,1664462053,NFTs on Instagram and Facebook: How to Show Off Your Digital Collectibles,"Instagram began testing non-fungible token (NFT) sharing on its platform in May 2022, allowing select U.S. users to connect to their digital wallets and showcase NFTs that they either created or bought. Instagram wrote at the time that it was focused on improving its user experience by creating more monetization opportunities and bringing NFTs to a broader audience.  In August 2022, the social media platform expanded its testing to 100 countries across Africa, Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and the Americas, and added support for Coinbase Wallet and Dapper Wallet. Meta Platforms, Instagram and Facebook's parent company, also started testing the feature on Facebook.  In September 2022, Meta rolled out the ability for all U.S. users across Facebook and Instagram. ""Additionally, everyone in the 100 countries where digital collectibles are available on Instagram can now access the feature,"" Meta noted in their update.  As of November 2022, Instagram is now allowing a select group of digital creators in the U.S. to mint and sell NFTs directly from the platform. The feature will initially launch on the Polygon blockchain and Instagram has pledged that neither creators nor collectors will need to pay gas fees for digital collectibles bought on Instagram at launch.  If you're able to access the feature and want to show off your NFTs, here’s how it works.  What does having NFTs on Instagram or Facebook mean?  The new NFT integration allows users to connect to their digital wallets and choose which NFTs to share with their followers. This feature sort of functions as a digital art gallery and the NFTs you own or have created can be pinned to your feed next to your other images. In the future, users may also be able to mint and sell NFTs directly from Instagram.  Read more: What Are PFP NFTs?  Once a user posts his or her NFT image, the platform adds a shimmery effect to the image and displays public information about the NFT, like a description of the collection, piece or tagging the creator. The shimmery effect functions similarly to the hexagonal profile pic on Twitter, visually indicating authenticity and ownership over the asset.  Both the creator and collector can be automatically attributed in-feed, another function meant to help track the authenticity and ownership of an NFT. Meta says there are no fees associated with sharing a digital collectible on Instagram or Facebook.  The integration is part of Meta’s company-wide exploration into Web3 technologies, which it says is aimed at expanding access, reducing costs and accelerating innovation as it expands its metaverse ambitions. In March 2022, CEO Mark Zuckerberg teased wider NFT integrations across the company's sites, like augmented-reality NFTs that can be shared on Instagram stories, and the ability to mint NFTs from Instagram.  How to post your NFT to Instagram  The best way to tell if the feature is available to you is to check if the “Digital Collectible” option can be found, as shown in the screenshot below.  Currently, users are allowed to connect to third-party wallets, including Rainbow, MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet and Dapper Wallet, with the Phantom wallet to be added soon. The blockchains it supported as of November 2022 were Ethereum, Polygon and Flow, with Solana to be added soon. Instagram will now also allow video-based digital collectibles to be shown on its platform.  Users can connect their digital wallets to the platform by visiting the “Digital Collectible” menu. Once there, a notification will open on your screen taking you through the next steps of connecting to a wallet. You can also connect additional wallets to your account by clicking the “Add Wallet” button. Wallet connection is a one-time authentication, and Meta says it doesn't “publicly surface” your wallet address.  Next, users can view all of their NFTs and share them as a post. Similar to sharing any other post on Instagram, users can tap the plus sign at the top of their screen and then select “Post.” A special verified checkmark will appear above your phone’s library, which will allow you to select any of the NFTs in your wallet. You can add a description to the selected NFT before sharing it to your feed.  When you share your digital collectible, you will be tagged as the owner or creator of that collectible. Instagram confirms ownership of the blockchain address associated with the collectible to authenticate ownership. Users can discover your digital collectibles in-feed, on your main grid and through the platform’s Explore page.  Sharing Digital Collectibles to your Facebook Feed  The process of sharing digital collectibles to your Facebook feed is similar to connecting on Instagram. Users should be able to find the digital collectibles tab under their bookmarks on the desktop version of the platform.  You'll need to connect your wallet in order to access your digital collectibles.  Next, you'll need to select one of your digital collectibles to show off on your Facebook feed. Once selected, you can click ""Share to feed,"" where you'll be prompted to choose whether the in-feed post will be public or shared to only a select group of friends.  You'll then be prompted to fill out your post with additional text, images or other details before posting. Once posted, the digital collectible will appear on your profile and main feed with the hexagonal ""Digital Collectibles"" badge.  Ways to monetize NFTs on Instagram and Facebook  Connecting your wallet to Instagram and Facebook may be a good way to show off your NFT collection or creations and verify its authenticity. The move follows other social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit that have recently added NFT functionalities.  As of November 2022, users couldn't use certain tools like Collab posting, fundraising, location tagging and monetization features like branded content and boosting that traditionally help content creators make money. The main opportunity regarding monetization was to use Instagram NFTs as an additional way to market or build hype for an NFT collection.  In the future, Meta may expand access to its minting and selling functionality, allowing creators to make their own digital collectibles and sell them both on and off Instagram, giving them an ""end-to-end toolkit"" for creating, displaying and selling NFTs.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MATIC,Rosie Perper,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/nfts-on-instagram-how-to-show-off-your-digital-collectibles,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5b0a523e5a29f0312a60ebf3756a4a7d2f84279b-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Punk, one of only 24 Apes punks, was last sold in November 2020 for 150 ETH ($71,300) to DJ Seedphrase, the pseudonym of Danny Maegaard. Maegaard currently owns 20 other punks, including his signature CryptoPunk 8348, which features a top hat, big beard, shades and a cigarette.  He told CoinDesk that he had been negotiating with a buyer who operates a family office out of Texas for the last week before deciding to sell his coveted hooded Ape punk.  ""I was running low on liquidity and NFT sales volume has taken a nosedive recently, so I knew it would take an exceptional grail to get some market movement,"" he told CoinDesk. ""I’ve regularly received private offers for the hoodie ape, so I knew the interest was there. It was just a matter of finding the right price.""

The ECB is developing guidelines (Peer-to-Peer Validation) that allow private sector mediators to disseminate the central bank&apos;s digital currency (CBDC). Peer-to-Peer Validation On Hold In a document released on Thursday, peer-to-peer validation possibilities were placed on hold as the ECB&apos;s governing council prepared to determine whether to release a digital edition of the euro, scheduled to be released in September 2023. The ECB would investigate employing individuals to confirm offline transactions, but the time to market for this approach is more unpredictable compared to one using traditional mediators like banks.

42394718,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASV3bq,1664459252,"Money Laundering via Metaverse, DeFi, NFTs Targeted by EU Lawmakers’ Latest Draft","Members of the European Parliament looking to tackle money laundering want to target large crypto transactions as well as the metaverse, decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFT), a draft bill seen by CoinDesk shows.  The European Parliament is currently deliberating on an overhaul of European Union money-laundering laws proposed by the European Commission in 2021.  The draft, badged as a set of “compromise amendments” to the law which seek to find consensus among different political factions, incorporates a July idea from left-wing lawmakers to include decentralized finance within the law’s scope.  DeFi, and the decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) that govern it, “should also be subject to Union [anti-money laundering/counter-terrorist financing] rules where they are controlled directly or indirectly, including through smart contracts or voting protocols, by natural and legal persons,” the text said.  Read more: NFT Platforms Should Be Subject to Money-Laundering Regulation, EU Lawmakers Say  “Developers, owners or operators should assess risks of money laundering and terrorist assessments before launching or using a software or platform,” it added.  Money laundering authorities have sought to outlaw the use of privacy-enhancing services such as Tornado Cash, fearing it’s used to process criminal money and prop up regimes like North Korea.  But authorities, including the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, have encountered difficulties in identifying individual entities to sanction. In a recent case, the OFAC targeted open-source crypto transaction anonymizer Tornado Cash, while a Russian software developer who contributed to the project, Alexey Pertsev, is currently awaiting trial in the Netherlands.  The compromise draft of the legislation, which still needs to be voted on by lawmakers before being squared with governments meeting in the EU’s Council, would also include Web3 companies among those obliged to carry out money laundering checks on their customers under EU law.  Under the plans, a list of ""obliged entities"" that currently covers banks, real estate agents and diamond traders would extend to include wallet and other crypto service providers regulated under the EU’s separate Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA). Traders who accept crypto payments for goods and services worth over 1,000 euros (US$970), and people and platforms trading or mining NFTs that represent artwork or collectibles, could also be required to check their clients' identity and report suspicious transactions under the plans.  The draft of the anti-money laundering regulation – which would complement a separate EU law on identifying the parties to crypto transactions – sees emerging areas of Web3 as a threat.  “The metaverse offers new opportunities for criminals who can convert cash acquired through illegal activities into non-traceable currencies to purchase and sell virtual real estate, virtual lands and other high-demand goods,” the draft said, warning of a risk of greater misuse as virtual realms become more popular.

This paves the way for unlocking new revenue streams, driving greater user adoption, and raising growth capital. At its core, Valuation, Tokenization, and Monetization as a Service (VTMaaS) is the ability to take something of value — like a company or asset — and break it down into small pieces that can be traded on a blockchain. This makes it easier for people to invest in things they might not have been able to before and opens up new opportunities for monetizing assets.

Market Moves  Surging Bitcoin-Sterling Trading Volume Points to Hedging Demand for Crypto, or Does It?  By Omkar Godbole  The bitcoin-British pound (BTC/GBP) pair listed on major cryptocurrency exchanges, including Bitstamp and Bitfinex, is more active than ever. Analysts, however, are divided on whether the surge stems from investors switching to the largest cryptocurrency to protect against the sterling slide or from traders looking to profit from the volatility.  On Monday, the day the pound crashed to a record low $1.035, trading volume in the pair listed on those two exchanges climbed to a record $881 million. That's 12 times the $70 million average daily volume of the past two years, according to data tweeted by James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, early this week.  The pound's weakness was prompted by concerns over the U.K.'s fiscal health stemming from the new government's tax-cut plans. This month, the currency has weakened 7% against the dollar, the steepest drop since December 2016.  ""An explosion in bitcoin trading against the pound underlines the potential of the biggest cryptocurrency to benefit from an apparent fragility in fiat currencies,"" analysts at Bitfinex said in an email.

42411363,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNIn5,1664455500,Worried About a Financial Crisis? Enter – Self Custody.,"You know what helps me sleep better at night? Having bitcoin (BTC) in cold storage.  Cold storage is an offline digital wallet that allows you to securely store your bitcoin and other digital assets through possession of unique private keys.  Unlike having your money held in a bank – which controls the funds, can lend them out freely and can even freeze the account – cold storage allows you to be your own banker and maintain full control.  That’s why I call bitcoin a bearer asset and think it’s a unique opportunity for clients of financial advisors in 2022. What is a bearer asset, you may ask? A bearer asset entitles the holder of an asset the rights of ownership or title to the underlying property.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.  Most assets, like cash, stocks and bonds, are held by financial institutions on behalf of their customers and rely on centralized databases listing them as an asset owner.  By contrast, having bitcoin in self custody is a big benefit because it allows the owner to hold it without counterparty risk, the possibility that a third party may default on its contractual obligations.  Come hell or high water, bitcoin is secure in cold storage because the digital asset is in true possession by the owner.  Read more: Hot vs. Cold Crypto Storage: What Are the Differences?  Self custody as protection during financial storms  For the first time in history, we’re experiencing a year where the long-term U.S. Treasury bond, the risk-off asset, has fallen even further than the S&P, which is down over 20%.  So, if we are on the brink of a financial crisis, we’ll want to be on guard.  From experience of previous financial crises, we know that the cascading risk can lead to contagion of other assets previously thought to be “safe.”  Individuals may be responsible for losses in these environments, but custodians or other financial intermediaries can also expose assets to risk.  I’ve written previously about why bitcoin belongs in portfolios even in a bear market as well as how to think about it in a portfolio with clients.  As currency markets are beyond strained, even the New York Times is asking whether bitcoin is going to be the “flight to safety.”  My crystal ball is cloudy, but the bitcoin optimist in me thinks bitcoin is a much needed asset, as I recently tweeted, “#Bitcoin was created following the last Great Financial Crisis. If we are entering another one, wouldn’t it make sense to have the best “outside” money you can w/o counterparty risk?”  Bitcoin provides the ability to eliminate counterparty risk, eliminate the risks of supply inflation and allows for self-custody. All of those factors could help clients of financial advisors sleep better at night when the financial world is figuring out which side is up and which is down.  How financial advisors can help  The good news is that financial advisors can be the heros who walk clients through the cold storage process.  Clients have two options when it comes to cold storage, although the latter can allow advisors to be more involved.  Clients can look into single signature wallets such as Ledger, ColdCard or BitBox.  They can look into multi-signature wallets – such as Casa or Unchained – or build a DIY set-up with Caravan, Electrum, Lily and others.  I believe the use of a multisignature wallet with an advisor holding one of three or more keys will be a billable and much-needed service for clients going forward.  Today, fees range from $250 to $3,000 for self-custody help and assistance in setting up multisignature wallets. To some that may sound like a lot. But if you hold a large amount of wealth in bitcoin, it’s worth doing it right.  Read more: Multisignature Wallets Can Keep Your Coins Safer (If You Use Them Right)  Enter an advisor who understands self-custody  I’ve been fortunate enough to work with clients on self-custody both in-person and virtually around the country.  I can say from experience that helping clients understand why self-custody is important – and building their confidence in it – is tremendously valuable.  There are not many advisors today who understand all the options and can walk clients through the process.  When it comes to self-custody, a crypto-savvy financial advisor can serve as a great source of knowledge.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Isaiah Douglass,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/29/worried-about-a-financial-crisis-enter-self-custody,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6691fb506802ce204cc02f3e8d5b9d3152dd13c6-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394734,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASV3ra,1664452800,Miners Take Off for The Great – and More Profitable – North,"Bitcoin (BTC) miners across Europe are fleeing to the northern parts of Norway and Sweden to cut power costs as energy prices skyrocket on the continent and bitcoin flatlines.  Mining economics has stopped making sense on much of the continent. Natural gas prices reached a record high of 321 euros ($309) per megawatt-hour (mWh) in August, compared with 27 euros a year ago. Meanwhile, the price of bitcoin has lost about 60% of its value this year and is hovering around $20,000.  Energy in the northernmost parts of Norway and Sweden is as much as 10 times cheaper than in the southern parts of those countries. That’s because the countries are split into different energy markets. The Nordics have a higher proportion of electricity coming from renewable energy compared with the rest of Europe – almost 100%. But the southern parts of the countries are connected to European markets, which means higher demand and thus higher prices.  Back in March, when CoinDesk visited Kryptovault in southern Norway, CEO Kjetil Pettersen said that his company, which runs data centers that host large-scale bitcoin miners, was looking to expand in the north as energy prices were starting to rise. That was before Russia invaded Ukraine, sending natural gas prices soaring. The company closed its operations in the south in May and June and has been slowly moving its machines to a site in the Lofoten region, just north of the Arctic Circle, Pettersen told CoinDesk.  Similarly, a smaller bitcoin mining site in southern Spain that CoinDesk also visited earlier this year is being moved to Paraguay, said the owner Jon Arregi.  The companies' situation is emblematic of how the bitcoin mining industry in Europe has been responding to energy prices that have shot up this year, largely because of the war in Ukraine. Miners are either shutting down or moving to places where energy is cheaper, especially in the far northern reaches of Norway and Sweden where there is abundant cheap hydropower, or in the Americas, even as they fear tougher regulations may be coming in states like New York.  Daniel Jogg, CEO of Hungarian miner and equipment supplier Enerhash, said that many companies in Germany have also stopped their operations there and are looking to move to the U.S. or Sweden.  Fiorenzo Manganiello, founder of UAE-based Cowa Energy, a mining company that also provides venture funding, said that in southern Norway “it’s impossible” to mine given the high energy prices. The current macroeconomic situation has been a “disaster” for the mining industry in Europe, he said.  But while the Nordics’ fragmented energy markets can bring opportunities, they also present difficulties in hedging power prices, Jogg said. The financial products sold to companies looking to hedge their power costs are aimed at the entire Nordics market, but the actual price of power miners are looking to hedge is likely for a narrower region, where they mine, he explained.  Power costs a pretty penny in much of Europe. In the second quarter, the average wholesale price of energy in France and Germany was more than double what it is in the U.S., according to the International Energy Agency. In mid-September, following measures to curb the price hikes, the wholesale price of power in many European countries was still more than 350 euros ($350) per megawatt-hour, several times more than what miners are looking for to break even.  Bad timing  The timing has been bad for miners, and several factors have contributed to an ever-worsening energy crisis. The war in Ukraine increased the price of natural gas after European political leaders sanctioned Russia, one of the continent’s biggest suppliers of fossil fuels.  Also, over the last few years European countries have decommissioned nuclear plants and closed coal factories, which also limited the supply of power. France, which has the largest share of its electricity generated by nuclear power in the world, shut down 32 of 56 reactors for maintenance this year.  The energy crisis has caused Germany to backtrack on some measures in a surprising move; the country’s parliaments voted to bring coal plants back to life over the summer.  Meanwhile, as the war in Ukraine rages on, European Union leaders have placed more sanctions on Russian gas companies, which prompted Russia to close the Nord Stream 1 pipeline in early September. That pipeline, which transports liquified natural gas from Russia to Germany, was allegedly “sabotaged” along with Nord Stream 2, on Sept. 28.  However, moving to the northern parts of Scandinavia isn’t risk-free for miners. There were a few days in September when the price of energy in northern Sweden increased to around 20 euro cents per kilowatt hour (kWh), compared with an average of around 3.5 euro cents per kWh the rest of the year, because of low wind production, Jogg said.  The future of the energy market looks uncertain, with demand expected to increase in the next few months as households try to cope with winter temperatures while European leaders remain unwilling to back down on sanctions.  At the same time, Europe has managed to fill its storage piles with natural gas that could help the bloc make through the winter. The initial shock from the Nord Stream pipeline closure to the energy market appears to be subsiding, with prices coming back down in the past few days.  New developments in nuclear power may also relieve some pressures. Rusinovich noted that a nuclear power plant set to go into full operation in Finland later in the year, the country’s fifth, and reactors in France coming back online in early 2023 after maintenance, could free up some of the market pressure on Norway and Sweden.  Policy implications  Europe’s politicians have started calling on their people in their countries to reduce their energy consumption – or else. French President Emmanuel Macron, for example, said that plans to ration energy are being prepared ""in case"" they are necessary.  In a speech earlier in September, European Commission President Ursula von der Layen said the commission is looking to overhaul the energy sector by imposing a cap on energy companies’ profits and perhaps a cap on the price of natural gas. The Commission is the European Union’s executive body.  Yet, Manganiello of Cowa Energy doesn’t see EU-level policy on mining coming any time soon because that process typically takes a long time, and it is usually local municipalities that approve mining projects.  But in the current crises in energy, geopolitics and possibly domestic affairs, “there is a lot of, let's say, witch hunting” and mining in the past has always been “an easy target,” Rusinovich said.  In the meantime, the icy pastures of northern Norway and Sweden beckon.

42422249,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0jGdh,1664448856,"Surging Bitcoin-Sterling Trading Volume Points to Hedging Demand for Crypto, or Does It?","The bitcoin-British pound (BTC/GBP) pair listed on major cryptocurrency exchanges, including Bitstamp and Bitfinex, is more active than ever. Analysts, however, are divided on whether the surge stems from investors switching to the largest cryptocurrency by market value to protect against the sterling slide or from traders looking to profit from the volatility.  On Monday, which was the day when the pound crashed to a record low $1.035, trading volume in the pair listed on those two exchanges climbed to a record $881 million. That's 12 times the $70 million average daily volume of the past two years, according to data tweeted by James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, an early-stage crypto investor, early this week.  The pound's weakness was prompted by concerns over the U.K.'s fiscal health stemming from the new government's tax-cut plans. This month, the currency has weakened 7% against the dollar, the steepest drop since December 2016.  ""An explosion in bitcoin trading against the pound underlines the potential of the biggest cryptocurrency to benefit from an apparent fragility in fiat currencies,"" analysts at Bitfinex said in an email.  Tom Dunleavy, an analyst at crypto data provider Messari, voiced a similar opinion in a research piece published Wednesday, saying European investors are snapping up bitcoin in the wake of the rapidly depreciating British pound and the euro.  Some observers, however, say trading volume – the total number of units or contracts exchanged between buyers and sellers – is an unreliable indicator of investor positioning. For every buyer, there is a seller, and so it's equally possible to argue that investors sold bitcoin as the pound took a hit.  ""If you're selling BTC for EUR or GBP, the volume will spike,"" said David Belle, founder of market news service and trading community platform Macrodesiac.com and U.K. growth director at TradingView. ""Same as if you're buying it.""  Bitcoin enthusiasts have long hailed the cryptocurrency as a better alternative to fiat currencies and gold. That's because the cryptocurrency's reward halving – a programmed reduction in the pace of supply expansion every four years – goes counter to the ever-increasing supply of fiat.  Cryptocurrencies have been embraced in Turkey and other nations where confidence in the national currency has been shaken because of high inflation, government policies and relentless depreciation.  Looking for volatility  Still, the increase in trading volume may be due to exchange-rate volatility and traders selling pounds and euros to build a crypto stash, according to trader and analyst Alex Kruger.  Those who bought bitcoin may not be planning to hold it for the long term. When facing a fiat currency slide, investors often snap up cryptocurrencies to move money overseas and buy dollarized assets while bypassing the traditional banking channel.  The measure of expected price turbulence, or implied volatility, in major currencies, including the pound, recently climbed above similar measures for developing-nation currencies, Bloomberg reported.  More volatility often leads to higher volumes in any market as seasoned traders buy and sell large quantities to capture profits. So the increase in the BTC/GBP volume may have stemmed from speculators rather than from investors looking to snap up BTC as an inflation hedge.  It's also possible traders have been scurrying to take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity offered by the pound's volatility. Arbitrage refers to simultaneously buying and selling the same asset in different markets to profit from tiny differencesin the asset's listed price.  ""We noticed BTC vs. GBP is dislocating from BTC vs. other fiat currencies, which means it is most likely a simple arbitrage trade,"" Clara Medalie, research director at crypto data provider Kaiko, said. ""The uptick in BTC/GBP volume does not necessarily mean traders are diversifying into bitcoin.""  While volumes in BTC/GBP have increased, the overall activity still remains low compared with the broader market.  ""The pure BTC/GBP cross (at least on Binance, which should be the leading benchmark with their volumes) trades only $95 million. That's tiny compared to the $9.5 billion that Binance executes in BTC/USDT cross,"" Markus Thielen, chief investment officer at British Virgin Islands-based IDEG Asset Management, said. Binance is the world's largest crypto exchange by volume.  ""If volumes are really driven by U.K.-based people, then the BTC/GBP cross on Binance should trade a lot more. We have seen this BTC/RUB had elevated levels of volumes initially during the Ukraine conflict,"" he said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/29/surging-bitcoin-sterling-trading-volume-points-to-hedging-demand-for-crypto-or-does-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/da13a789f9ed1b457d4f8265610ddd40007804c4-1280x851.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The report also highlights how peer-to-peer transactions are more common in Sub-Saharan Africa than anywhere else in the world. At about 6% of all crypto transaction volume, Africa’s peer-to-peer transactions dwarf those of Central and Southern Asia and Oceania, the region with the second-highest volumes in that category.  Read more: Bitcoin Nonprofit ₿trust Launches Africa Open Source Cohort; Names First Developer  Many Africans have integrated crypto into everyday life, the report says. Besides retail transactions, remittances and commercial transactions have also been key drivers for Africa’s high adoption and usage rates.  “Crypto usage is driven by everyday necessity, as opposed to speculation by the already well-off … especially in countries where the values of local fiat currencies are dropping, as we’ve seen in Nigeria and Kenya,” the report states.  What makes Africa different?  At first glance, some of the high-level figures in the Chainalysis report tell the story of a continent with the lowest cryptocurrency transaction volume in the world ($100.6 billion in on-chain volume received between July 2021 and June 2022, according to Chainalysis).  A deeper dive into the report, however, reveals first, a very diverse region with varying usage and adoption rates, and second, a genuine need for crypto.  Africa’s diverse crypto usage and adoption rates  The Chainalysis report links to the Global Crypto Adoption Index (also by Chainalysis) that juxtaposes countries like Burkina Faso and Malawi against other African countries such as Nigeria and Kenya.  Of 146 countries, the index ranked Burkina Faso and Malawi at 133 and 137 respectively, while Nigeria and Kenya were 11 and 19 respectively. This wide range highlights the diversity of crypto usage and adoption across the African continent.  Read more: Mara Raises $23M From Coinbase, Alameda to Spread Crypto Adoption Across Africa  A genuine need for crypto  Chainalysis contrasts affluent Western countries that use crypto to increase wealth with poorer African countries that use crypto to preserve and build wealth amid unfavorable economic conditions.  “We don’t have big, institutional-level traders in Sub-Saharan Africa,” Adedeji Owonibi, founder of Nigeria-based blockchain consulting company and product studio Convexity, said in an interview with Chainalysis. “The people driving the market here are retail. Nigeria has a ton of highly educated young graduates with high unemployment rates, no jobs available – crypto to them is a rescue. It’s a way to feed their family.”  Opportunities abound  A market that has crypto integrated into everyday life may present unique opportunities for entrepreneurs and startups. The report explains that retail usage remains consistent or even increases in the face of a bear market.  “The number of small retail transfers actually grew starting at the onset of the bear market in May,” the report states.  It seems startups that can facilitate retail, commercial and peer-to-peer transactions have a decent shot at success in Africa.

Trading for QQL increased all day. Visual artists Tyler Hobbs and Dandelion Wist, co-founders of the generative art network Archipelago, joined forces to create the first NFT project. The QQL method is open to everyone, but only mint pass holders can make their designs into officially licensed NFTs. The QQL Algorithm In a modified Dutch auction on Archipelago, the project sold out of its mint passes, which allow NFT collectors to act as co-creators of artwork through the QQL algorithm. Dutch auctions enable prospective buyers to submit blind bids within a specific price range, and the final selling price is determined once all bids have been considered. The auction for these 900 mint passes began at 50 ETH ($66,890) and fell over an hour. The QQL Mint Pass blocks the wallet address for X2Y2, negating any attempt to transact with the marketplace. The action appears to be in response to last month&apos;s discussion about whether NFT platforms should impose artist royalties, in which specific protocols, including X2Y2 and SudoAMM, chose not to. Spike In Sales According to statistics, the project quickly surpassed well-known initiatives like CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) in terms of trading volume in secondary sales, generating more than 15,176 ETH (about $20.3 million) within hours of its launch.

42422244,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0jGVh,1664444001,EU Lawmakers Attack Amazon’s Involvement in Digital Euro Project,"A cross-party coalition of members of the European Parliament on Thursday turned their fire on the European Central Bank for picking U.S. retail giant Amazon to help develop a digital euro.  Fabio Panetta, an Italian economist who's on the ECB's executive board, turned up to a morning meeting of the Economic and Monetary Affairs committee with a prepared speech on the currency’s design features – perhaps expecting the usual placid exchange of views over plans for the European Union's central bank digital currency.  Instead, he was met with demands from furious lawmakers to backtrack on his decision to pick the U.S. company – the subject of numerous controversies – to develop a prototype for e-commerce applications of the putative new CBDC.  “We know that the reputation of Amazon in terms of social and tax policy is questionable, I have to say,” said center-left lawmaker Eero Heinäluoma, citing a record-breaking fine of 746 million euros ($720 million) the company received from data protection regulators last year for allegedly breaching privacy rules, a decision that the company has since appealed. “What does Amazon have that could not be found in the European Union?”  Other lawmakers questioned whether the choice would undermine the stated goals Panetta has for the digital euro – to keep EU payments competitive and free from foreign meddling.  “How do you explain this choice really?” asked Stéphanie Yon-Courtin, a lawmaker from French President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist Renew Europe coalition. “In July 2022, you were saying about the digital euro that it would protect the strategic autonomy of European payments and monetary sovereignty … You were also saying that a digital euro would help to avoid market dominance. Three months later, we've been announced that Amazon has been selected over 54 companies.”  Lawmakers from the Green Party went further, calling for the ECB to reverse the decision to avoid undermining the entire project.  “I would like to know whether you would consider revising the decision,” said the Greens’ Ernest Urtasun. He drew parallels with the now-abandoned Libra initiative, in which the involvement of the “big American company” Facebook (now Meta Platforms) in a cryptocurrency project drew “strong opposition.”  If there is no change of heart, Urtasun asked if Panetta is worried that ""this project – which is essential and that the parliament supported – will not start with a very strong lack of credibility.”  Panetta defended his decision, arguing that Amazon had been chosen based on pre-issued criteria that he was powerless to change now and that the prototypes Amazon develops would not be reused later on.  “We wanted to have one merchant, and only one merchant applied” to the call for tender, Panetta said. “We want to learn [from] the best technology not from the worst one … there are not many companies in Europe that could show their experience in dealing with hundreds of millions of users.  “There is no impact of this prototyping exercise on the future development on the actual participation to the terms of the digital euro,” Panetta said. “You are concerned what could be the consequences of this exercise? Zero.""  Panetta also stressed that, for its participation, the company received neither financial rewards, nor privileged data about the project or its users – but if anything, those assurances seemed to increase lawmakers’ disquiet.  “Honestly, I am now more worried than before,” said the Socialist Party’s Jonás Fernández, because the lack of a financial reward implied the company was profiting in some other way.  Amazon declined to comment on the hearing, but reiterated a previous statement that it was ""excited to work with the European Central Bank on their digital euro prototyping exercise.""

42422248,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0jGZh,1664440892,Bernstein Says Polygon Blockchain Is Bringing Crypto to Consumers,"The success of the Polygon blockchain in bringing scalability to Ethereum shows that developers have to reach out to mainstream consumers and not operate solely within the “crypto cult,” Bernstein said in a research report Wednesday.  Polygon has a large user base of about 170 million addresses, of which some 300,000 are classed as active, Bernstein said. It’s growing at a pace of 80,000 new users a day.  The network was the first platform to offer scalability for Ethereum with its proof-of-stake (PoS) chain, Bernstein said, which encouraged leading decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) applications to offer their products on the system. Polygon also has lower fees, making it easier for applications such as trading platforms Uniswap and OpenSea to cater to retail demand.  The broker notes that Meta (META), Stripe, Starbucks (SBUX) and Robinhood (HOOD) all chose Polygon as their “first integration partner to build Web3 experiences.” A strong partnership pipeline gives Polygon growth and on-ramps to millions of users, it added.  The “other secret” behind Polygon has been organizational. The blockchain has hired from YouTube, Airbnb (ABNB), Electronic Arts (EA), Amazon Cloud and other large corporations to build a “truly global organization,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agrawal wrote.  DeFi is an umbrella term used for lending, trading and other financial activities carried out on a blockchain without the use of traditional intermediaries. NFTs are digital assets on a blockchain that represent ownership of virtual or physical items and can be sold or traded.  With Ethereum’s recent migration to PoS, known as the Merge, the blockchain is building a “rollup-centric scalability roadmap,” the note said.  Given this context, “the supporting ecosystems such as Polygon would continue to invest in building rollup technologies such as zero-knowledge rollups, but their success is likely to be more determined by organizational and business development efforts,” Bernstein said, adding that “they are more business-orientated ecosystems focused on building a consumer gateway leveraging partnerships with leading consumer brands.”  Polygon’s success so far, has shown its ability to build a “more mainstream customer gateway,” the note added, with focus now on the zero-knowledge (ZK) ecosystem.  The Merge is the first of five upgrades planned for the Ethereum blockchain. Rollups expand the Ethereum network by processing transactions and executing smart contracts – computer programs that run on some blockchains – on their own chains.

A document published on Thursday puts peer-to-peer validation options on the back burner as the ECB’s governing council prepares for a decision on whether to issue a digital version of the euro, due in September 2023.  The ECB will examine using individual users to validate transactions offline, but “the time to market for this solution is more uncertain” than one involving traditional intermediaries like banks, given uncertainties over technology and security, the document said. “The development of a third-party validated solution for online payments should not be delayed in case the timely delivery of a peer-to-peer validated solution for offline payments proves to be unfeasible.”  A third option, using peer-to-peer validation online, was dismissed by the central bank as a “more experimental alternative” that won’t be further investigated for the time being.  Fabio Panetta, an ECB executive board member, told lawmakers it is of “utmost importance that the [e]urosystem retains full control over digital euro issuance and settlement,” but added that officials are also looking at the regulations that would set out how the private sector could be involved in distributing the digital euro.  “We will soon start work on a rulebook for the digital euro scheme,” setting out which entities can participate and how they would operate, Panetta said.

Over the last 24 hours, however, LTC moved up on its chart by 2.4%. The bulls have yet to steady themselves on the one-day chart. Over the last week, LTC gained almost 3%. This indicated that the coin has not made any such considerable movement on its chart. The bears were in charge of the altcoin, as indicated by the technical indicators. There is a significant immediate resistance for the Litecoin price to overcome. The buyers were low in the market, and that has tired the bulls out consistently. At the moment, the coin has found support near the $51 price mark. Because selling strength was greater than buyer strength in the market, the Litecoin price may not stay above that level for long. On the other hand, if buying strength stabilises slightly, then there is a chance for LTC to move above $56. Broader market strength will be crucial for Litecoin over the next trading sessions. Litecoin Price Analysis: One Day Chart LTC was trading at $53 at the time of writing. Litecoin price will witness tough resistance at the $56 price mark. The bulls have moved closer to that price mark each time, but it has met with selling strength. Moving above the $56 price mark could help Litecoin price invalidate the bearish thesis.

Three weeks ago, before the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates a hawkish 75 basis points, before bond yields rose to 15-year highs and the British pound tanked, before the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank into bear market territory, Russia escalated its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and the prospects of a severe global recession increased exponentially, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading above $19,000.  On Wednesday, BTC was still trading comfortably above $19,000, up more than 4% over the past 24 hours and seemingly impervious to the increasingly volatile macroeconomic environment. How long bitcoin holds above this threshold remains uncertain as is its previously considered role as an inflation hedge.  ""There are a few things that we don't know,"" Defiance ETFs co-founder and CEO Sylvia Jablonski told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program. ""We thought crypto would be this great inflation hedge. It would be the new gold and that didn't play out. It turned out crypto was highly correlated with equities, particularly with high growth stocks, Nasdaq.""  Ether showed similar toughness as it hovered near $1,340, up nearly 5% from a day earlier. Other major cryptos spent the day solidly in the green, with BNB and XRP recently up close to 5% and 4%, respectively, although the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures performance across a basket of cryptocurrencies, was roughly flat.  Still, crypto price gains tracked equity indexes yet again, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) all closing up about 2%. The S&P and DJIA had plummeted the previous six days with the latter falling into bear market territory, meaning that it is down at least 20% from its previous peak. Asian indexes were largely up in early Thursday trading with the Hang Seng recently rising about 1.8%.  Investors seemed buoyed by the Bank of England (BOE) announcement that would it would purchase U.K. government bonds to address a liquidity crunch in the market. The move also spurred hopes that other central banks might soon abandon their current aggressive monetary policies through which they hope to tame inflation.  Early in the day, BOE Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe told an audience at the Operations, Post Trade, Technology and Innovation Conference in London that financial regulations should be extended to crypto before the industry becomes large enough to potentially threaten broader financial stability. Cunliffe has previously said that regulators should accelerate efforts to establish clear rules for crypto.  And in the ongoing saga of Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon, the company said South Korean prosecutors overextended their authority in seeking a warrant for his arrest, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal, citing a statement sent by Terraform.  Defiance ETFs' Jablonski said that cryptos' current pricing may offer a buying opportunity, albeit in the long term. ""I'm definitely feeling the headwinds in my face every time I turn on the news on a daily basis, but ... crypto has been oversold since August.""  She added: ""It's not a buying opportunity if you're looking for returns in the next two months. But if you have a holding period of 12, 18 months out, I'm more than happy to dip in here. I'm going to be very happy in a couple of years, and I'm going to feel a lot of pain if I look at it on a daily basis.""

By David Z. Morris  While the declining domestic buying power of a dollar dominates headlines in the United States, American inflation is having a surprising impact around the globe: Nearly every major currency has fallen dramatically against the dollar over the past six months. That seems like a challenge to the relentless focus on monetary supply that is widespread among cryptocurrency adherents.  China’s yuan has lost 12% against the dollar since April, and traditionally stronger currencies including the euro and yen have seen similar drops. Controversial financial decisions by new U.K. Prime Minister Liz Truss have driven the British pound down even more sharply in recent days, for a cumulative 18% drop since April.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  These moves may be particularly surprising for those whose financial thinking has been shaped by discussions in cryptocurrency circles. You might argue the tail has wagged the dog on crypto’s understanding of inflation: Bitcoin’s fixed supply has been aggressively marketed as a long-term inflation hedge, leading to an emphasis on so-called monetary inflation. Monetary inflation occurs when more monetary units compete for the same amount of real-world goods, driving prices up. Or, as a coronavirus pandemic-era meme elegantly simplified it, “money printer go brrrrr.”  But if the money supply were the beginning and end of the American inflation story, the dollar should be losing value against world currencies. The U.S., after all, had the second-largest fiscal response to the COVID-19 crisis of any industrialized nation, much of it debt financed. But if America has been borrowing and printing more money than Japan or China, shouldn’t the yen and yuan be gaining relative value on global markets? ...

The unique non-fungible token (NFT) project is a collaboration between visual artist Tyler Hobbs and Dandelion Wist, co-founder of generative art platform Archipelago. The QQL algorithm is open for everyone to use but only mint pass holders will be able to turn their creations into official NFTs in the collection.  The project, which allows NFT collectors to act as co-creators of artwork through the QQL algorithm, sold out of its mint passes offered at a modified dutch auction on Archipelago. Essentially, a Dutch auction allows potential buyers to place blind bids within a certain set of pricing parameters, and the final selling price is determined after taking in all bids. In this case, the auction started at 50 ETH (about $66,890) and decreased over the course of one hour until all 900 mint passes were sold.  The final price for all 900 mint passes ended at 14 ETH, or about $18,729. In total, the project raised 126,000 ETH, equivalent to about $16.5 million.  According to Nansen.ai, the project quickly jumped above blue chip projects like CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club in terms of trading volume in secondary sales, raising over 15,176 ETH (about US$20.3 million) within hours of minting. Many of the buyers of the QQL mint passes are also holders of Fidenza NFTs, Hobbs' original generative NFT project that recently saw a spike in sales.

In a press release Wednesday, the state’s department of justice said the agency had issued a cease-and-desist order to 23 entities, including wallets, accounts and individuals.  The announcement is part of a wider Delaware DOJ initiative to halt “pig butchering” crypto scams.  The agency urged investors to tread cautiously in online conversations about cryptocurrency transactions.  Crypto romance scams have been around for several years. They involve bad actors conversing with strangers online and instructing them to invest in crypto before siphoning off their funds. “Pig butchering” scams operate along similar principles with scammers convincing consumers to invest small amounts in crypto over time before siphoning these assets – fattening the pig before butchering it.

42422240,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0jGLh,1664411380,"Bitcoin Could ‘Double in Price’ Under CFTC Regulation, Chairman Behnam Says","Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Rostin Behnam said Wednesday that CFTC-led regulation could have significant benefits for the crypto industry, including a potential boost to the price of bitcoin.  “Growth might occur if we have a well-regulated space,” Behnam told attendees during a fireside chat at NYU School of Law. “Bitcoin might double in price if there’s a CFTC-regulated market.”  Behnam has consistently argued for the need to provide market participants with regulatory clarity – something that many in the crypto industry have argued is lacking. For years, the CFTC and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have squabbled over the role of top regulator for the crypto industry, both reluctant to issue much in the way of formal guidance for crypto companies, choosing instead to set regulatory precedent through enforcement actions.  A clear regulatory framework, Behnam argued, could pave the way for institutional investors to enter the market.  “These incumbent institutions in the crypto space see a massive opportunity for institutional inflows that will only occur if there’s a regulatory structure around these markets,” Behnam said.  “Non-bank [crypto] institutions thrive on regulation, they thrive on regulatory certainty, they thrive on a level playing field,” Behnam added. “And they may say otherwise, they might bicker about the type of regulation – but what they love most is regulation because they are the smartest, the fastest and the most well-resourced. With those attributes, they can beat everyone else in the market.”  Settling the debate through legislation  A bipartisan bill introduced by the leaders of the Senate Agriculture Committee, which oversees the CFTC, would crown the CFTC the primary regulator for the crypto industry, expanding the agency’s authority to oversee crypto spot markets and requiring crypto trading firms to register with the CFTC – though it stopped short of explicitly defining where one agency’s purview ended and the other’s began.  Behnam said on Thursday that he supports the bill, which includes a provision that would allow the cash-strapped agency to levy fees on regulated entities – something Behnam argued would be critical if CFTC is to tackle the challenge of regulating crypto.  “We are [currently] appropriated money by Congress, and it has put us in a position where we feel like we’re constantly on edge about how much money we will be appropriated,” Behnam said. “We are still feeling the wounds and scars from about five or six years of flat funding.”  The CFTC’s battle with the dual issues of jurisdiction over crypto markets and its comparatively small operating budget has impacted its ability to effectively deal with crypto crime, Behnam told the audience on Thursday.  “We’re only touching the tip of the iceberg,” Behnam said. “The 60 or so cases [the CFTC has] brought, we’ve had to solely rely on whistleblowers, on customer complaints and on tips coming to us.  “We don’t have the traditional surveillance tools, the market oversight tools, to monitor trading platforms, to oversee broker-dealers or similarly-situated intermediaries … [T]hose are the types of things we fall a little bit short on, not because of lack of effort but because of a lack of jurisdiction,” he added.

The firms unveiled their partnership Wednesday during Circle’s Converge22 conference in San Francisco.  Block is a payments firm that runs Cash App and is helmed by Twitter (TWTR) co-founder and notable bitcoin (BTC) proponent Jack Dorsey. Its filial, TBD, is an open-source developer platform that has been working on a decentralized crypto exchange called TBDex. TBD has been working on a so-called Web5 decentralized identity initiative that would allow people to retain their user data and interact with each other without intermediaries.  Read more: Jack Dorsey’s TBD Announces Web 3 Competitor: Web5  Various government-issued currencies’ value nosedived against the U.S. dollar due to rampant inflation worldwide and aggressive tightening of monetary policy. People living in countries with rapidly depreciating currencies – such as in Argentina or Turkey – took refuge in crypto to protect their savings from devaluation, and U.S. dollar-linked stablecoins became a popular alternative for savings and remittances to elude local capital controls and unlock cheaper transactions.  “The U.S. dollar is the reserve currency today, and we think bitcoin might be the reserve currency of tomorrow. Stablecoins are the bridge in between,” Emily Chiu, TBD’s chief operating officer, told CoinDesk.  The collaboration between TBD and Circle aims to lay the foundation to access stablecoins globally, so developers can build upon the infrastructure and crypto wallet providers can plug into the open-source protocol. This includes building the sufficient links – on-ramps and off-ramps – between the traditional government-issued (fiat) currencies and blockchain-based digital currencies.  “This is crypto’s last-mile problem, how you get people in and out of crypto,” Chiu said. “Today, it’s too hard for someone who isn't a crypto native to access crypto in a decentralized way, and for crypto natives to off-ramp into fiat money depending on their jurisdictions.”  Circle’s USDC, the second largest stablecoin on the market with a $49 billion circulating supply, stands to benefit from being a bridge for cross-border payments.  Kash Razzaghi, Circle’s chief revenue officer, told CoinDesk that remittances are one of the most compelling use cases for stablecoins, and highlighted the U.S.-Mexican cross-border payments market as a focus for Circle.
