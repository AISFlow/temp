The price of the digital asset had grown from its $40K lows to over $57K at the time of this writing. Its recovery trends have put it on a path of least resistance towards the previous $64K all-time high. But on-chain metrics have shown even more favorable trends among investors in the asset. Bitcoin Active Entities (i.e number of active users on the blockchain each day) paints a bullish picture for the asset going forward. This metric had dropped between May and September 2021, nearing lows seen in January 2020 when the bear market was still in full force. However, there has been a significant uptick in the number of Active Entities on the blockchain following the bull rally started at the beginning of October. Bitcoin Active Entities Up 19% Data from Glassnode shows that bitcoin Active Entities have seen an increase in recent weeks. At its lowest, Active Entities dropped to a little over 200K this year, down over 50% from its high of over 400K between January and February 2021. As the price of the asset has begun to soar again, so has the number of Active Entities.

Coinbase received 755 complaints from 2017 through April 2021, according to the Massachusetts Student Public Interest Research Group (MASSPIRG), a consumer research and consumer advocacy group, which reviewed complaints filed with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The CFPB first began receiving complaints about digital wallets in 2017.  Complaints against Coinbase and other cryptocurrency exchanges have been rising steadily. Coinbase received the most complaints among the top crypto exchanges in the U.S., with 1,060 overall over a year-long period starting in May 2020, including complaints about its digital wallet, and domestic and international money transfers. The rise in complaints has dovetailed with Coinbase’s rapid growth. The company now has over 68 million verified users.  Coinbase did not respond to a request for comment as of press time.  The U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services cited the MASSPIRG report in a memorandum for an Oct. 14 hearing on the impact of the cashless economy on underserved communities.

42396765,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT59VG,1634071244,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Declines as Indicator Shows Rally Could Lose Steam,"Bitcoin’s price dipped below $57,000 on Tuesday as analysts said the extreme buying in the market could mean the rally may soon be running out of steam.  They pointed to the bitcoin Fear & Greed Index, which entered “extreme greed” territory last week and is at the highest level since early September, which preceded a sharp sell-off in bitcoin.  Comments from J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon at a conference on Monday contributed to a sour mood across crypto markets. Dimon stated that governments will regulate bitcoin, which he personally thinks is “worthless.”  On the regulatory front, “China’s domestic energy and power crunch has led to increased scrutiny of mining projects in various regions, such as the seizure of idle mining machines in inner Mongolia,” WuBlockchain wrote in a Monday newsletter.  Some analysts consider the recent rally in crypto prices is being driven by continued speculation the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will finally approve a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), although others are skeptical an approval will have a beneficial effect on bitcoin’s price.  Latest prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $55,336, -3.7%  Ether (ETH): $3,466, -1.5%  S&P 500: -0.2%  Gold: $1,761, +0.4%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.566%  “The market is over-emphasizing (SEC Chairman) Gary Gensler’s public comments about support for the [Chicago Mercantile Exchange] and futures,” Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca, a digital asset management firm, in an email to CoinDesk. “We believe the concerns the SEC has raised historically regarding market manipulation of bitcoin and unregulated exchanges have not been solved.”  Still, some analysts remain optimistic, pointing to improving blockchain data and bitcoin’s rising price trend.  Transaction activity on the rise  Increasing transaction activity on the Bitcoin blockchain could point to fresh buying demand this quarter, according to data compiled by Glassnode.  “Active entities, the count of individual participants on-chain each day, has grown 19% to this week, reaching around 291K active entities per day,” Glassnode wrote in a blog post. “More active market participants have historically correlated with growing interest in the asset during early stage bull markets.”  The value and size of transactions are also increasing, which could mean large buyers are starting to accumulate BTC after the sell-off last month.  The chart below shows bitcoin’s transfer volume as a percentage of the realized market capitalization. Transfer volume greater than 3% of the realized market cap typically marks the beginning of a bullish market phase as the relative value of network utility increases, according to Glassnode.  Bitcoin miner profits recover  “The increasing bitcoin price coupled with a stagnating hashrate (blockchain computing power) has made 2021 a very lucrative year for bitcoin miners,” Arcane Research wrote in a Tuesday report.  Bitcoin mining profitability accelerated during the first days of October, which also led to a brief rise in some miner share prices, although performance is mixed. Marathon Digital (NASDAQ: MARA) stock is up about 64% over the past three months, compared to an 11% decline in Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ: RIOT) and a 69% rise in BTC during the same period.  “It’s essential to keep in mind that these calculations don’t consider all the costs of bitcoin mining, only the operational,” Arcane wrote, which means miners will need to sustain margin growth.  “As more miners come online it gets harder to access hardware and hosting so those costs go up, competition and profitability starts coming down and only the large-scale miners are able to survive long term,” Fred Thiel, CEO of Marathon Digital Holdings, said during an interview with CoinDesk.  Altcoin roundup  Binance dedicates another $1 billion to Binance Smart Chain (BSC) project: Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange by daily trading volume, announced Tuesday it had committed $1 billion to further boost BSC’s growth, reported CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen. A year ago, Binance put up $100 million to support decentralized finance (DeFi) projects on BSC. “BSC’s growth has attracted 100 million more DeFi users with just an initial funding of $100 million,” Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said in a press release. “With the new contribution of $1 billion, it can disrupt traditional finance and accelerate global mass adoption of digital assets to become the first-ever blockchain ecosystem with one billion users.”  XDEFI releases cross-chain wallet for DeFi and NFTs: XDEFI Wallet has released a rival to MetaMask that was built with decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in mind and allows users to interact across multiple blockchains, reported CoinDesk’s Jamie Crawley. XDEFI offers access to chains such as THORChain and Terra and aims to allow users to move between protocols easily and automatically add new chains.

42394401,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvczKz,1634071231,What Jamie Dimon Doesn’t Understand About Bitcoin,"On Monday, speaking at an event hosted by the Institute of International Finance, JPMorgan Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon once again said the outlook for bitcoin is grim. At various times in the past Dimon has gone on record calling bitcoin “fool’s gold” and “a fraud.” Dimon doesn’t understand.  “I personally think that bitcoin is worthless,” Dimon, “the bellwether of the Davoisie,” said most recently of the $1 trillion asset, the first cryptographically-derived currency that has kick-started an industry working to reinvent money, the internet and, yes, banks.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Of course, while Dimon has his own personal beliefs – they don’t quite measure up to the position of JPMorgan. In recent years, the largest bank in the U.S. by assets has rolled out its own digital currency, JPM coin, has moved hard into crypto asset research and, in August, has opened access to crypto funds for its wealthy clientele.  It’s easy to write off Dimon’s comments as hypocritical – coming from someone willing to profit from an industry while also questioning its fundamental value. And, indeed, Dimon has regretted calling bitcoin a fraud. “I don’t want to be a spokesperson – I don’t care. It makes no difference to me,” Dimon the nihilist told the IIF.  This mercenary attitude goes far in explaining why Dimon is routinely caught off guard by bitcoin, and why the industry seems to carry on and thrive despite his criticisms. Take his comments yesterday regarding bitcoin’s supply cap, theoretically locked in at 21 million BTC.  “I’ll just challenge the group to one other thing: How do you know it ends at 21 million? You all read the algorithms? You guys all believe that? I don’t know, I’ve always been a skeptic of stuff like that,” he reportedly said.  Although not at the center of his critique of bitcoin’s long-term viability – which tends to go back to regulatory risks and potential crackdowns – this question does penetrate the heart of bitcoin’s value proposition. A fool isn’t someone who asks dumb questions but fails to listen to answers, someone, somewhere at some time, may have said.  The quick and dirty response is that bitcoin is the only monetary system that offers certain guarantees – including “ending” at 21 million coins. That’s what sets it apart from the fiat model.  In a recent Forbes column discussing the rationale behind “bitcoin maximalism,” bitcoin influencer (and my former boss at CoinDesk) Pete Rizzo enumerated four “core rights” guaranteed by this unique economic system:  an irrevocable right to money through holding private keys  a right to audit the money supply by running a node  the right to know bitcoin’s money supply and issuance policy (those “halvenings” you may have heard about)  the right to dissent – both by rejecting changes made to the protocol, and, unstated, by dropping out of U.S. dollar hegemony.  Some of these guarantees are technological, or embedded in the code that, as Dimon notes, is auditable. Others are socially directed. Bitcoin as a digital network will always enable the ability for users to hold their coins and transact peer-to-peer. Likewise, people will always be able to run a node and audit the money supply. It’s in the code.  Dimon’s question about the supply cap gets into squishier territory. He’s right in saying that there’s no technological limit in place to prevent developers from changing that particular characteristic of Bitcoin. And, depending on how things go, there’s at least a possibility that there will be economic incentive to add more coins. As Blocktower Capital’s Ari Paul put it in response to Dimon on Twitter: “So really the question is, ‘will people change the code.’”  Last month, former Bitcoin Core contributor Gavin Andresen wrote a bit of science fiction discussing one of those “possible” futures. There are essentially two bitcoins here: the version we’re running now that is slightly inflationary and secured by a mining subsidy – the network pays out a predictable amount of coins to those willing to expend energy to build the blockchain through a process called “proof-of-work” – and the one after the subsidy is gone.  Sometime in 2140, all 21 million BTC will have been issued to miners and the network will rely on fees to pay for security. It’s reasonable to ask what happens then, especially as others have noted bitcoin’s fee economy has yet to mature. Thankfully, most people in the bitcoin community have the humility to say that they don’t know.  “We can’t guarantee a fee market for Bitcoin will work. We simply don’t have the data for this,” a well-regarded writer with a hardline stance on Bitcoin who I won’t name said. But there are still larger order rights that bitcoin can guarantee, even if the experiment fails. Chiefly, it’ll remain hard money.  Read more: With 18 Million Bitcoins Mined, How Hard Is That 21 Million Limit?  As Paul writes, anyone can change bitcoin’s code at any time they want. The trickier thing is getting people to use it, for miners to secure it and for developers to build on it. That’s the social technology that secures Bitcoin. As a matter of consensus, bitcoiners can change the 21 million cap. But it depends on what is in their economic interest. In the past, powerful groups sought to change a fundamental characteristic of bitcoin and were shot down. There have also been a number of altcoins that take bitcoin’s source code and change a few parameters.  The 21 million cap may not be encoded into bitcoin permanently, but it’s become a definitional aspect of it. If it were to change, that wouldn’t be Bitcoin. It’s part of the brand, yes. But also what believers are buying into – that bitcoin separates itself from an inflationary economy that sees primarily the rich get richer. That’s precisely what Dimon fails to grasp. That bitcoin is not just code, but a community.  He may not “care” about Bitcoin. But plenty of people do.

As the top-ranked cryptocurrency surprisingly weathers the macro turmoil as of late, altcoins have suffered dramatically and for the most part bled while BTC has been rising. Alt investors are capitulating, and moving their capital into BTC as to not miss the coming last leg up. But what exactly does this mean for the ongoing altcoin season? Is it over? Or will there be another leg up like there could be in Bitcoin - a move that is becoming increasingly clear by the day? Alt Season, Bitcoin Dominance, And The Theory Of Five Waves Down Bitcoin and altcoins have a very unusual relationship, despite being assets of the same class. Top traders such as Nik Patel have spent years working to understand the strange, cyclical behavior between BTC and alts, and have found some success. After such an explosive altcoin season, the market is convinced that the music has already stopped, asset prices have topped out, and have started to reallocate heavily into the strength of BTC.

The first metric of relevance is the Bitcoin funding rate, which is defined as the periodic payment that futures contract traders have to pay. Positive values imply most traders are bullish and long traders are paying this fee to short traders. While negative values mean just the opposite; traders are bearish on Bitcoin and short traders have to pay long traders. The other indicator is the futures open interest. This metric shows the total number of futures contracts that are open at the end of the trading day.

Now Steady State is seeking to push DeFi out of the &apos;fear zone&apos; by insuring funds held on decentralized protocols. Insurance for DeFi Steady State is launching a comprehensive insurance solution for decentralized finance (DeFi). The project shifts responsibility from individual users, and the protocol holding the underlying assets, and transfers that responsibility to Steady State insurance. Theoretically, this should allow all parties to sleep more soundly at night. Decentralized finance in its current form can never fully realize its potential: the risks from flash loan exploits, hacks, and stablecoin de-pegging mean that a large swathe of potential investors will simply never venture into the market. Any cursory examination of the sector makes it easy to understand why that is. A single flash loan attack in February of this year drained $37 million from C.R.E.A.M. protocol tanking the price of its native token by 30% in half an hour. In May, flash loan exploits on a single chain, Binance Smart Chain, totalled $167 million. These sorts of reports effectively place a handbrake on the market, slowing its growth and making bigger investors and institutions turn away.

The asset had rallied 266% and by the time the rally reached its peak, SHIB had grown over 400% in a matter of hours. Its sudden rise in price has been attributed to a number of things. One of the most prominent being the tweet by Elon Musk of his pet Shiba Inu which he had gotten last month. However, the price recovery had occurred at a point where the asset had been seeing massive amounts of coins dumped that led to a dip in its price. SHIB had hit a new six-month high at this point and sell pressures had mounted in the community. This was mostly due to the history of the meme coin which has no utility to speak of except the hype from its backers. SHIB Holders Dump Billions Santiment reported the digital asset had seen a record dump following its price rally. A reported 31.07 billion coins had been dumped by holders. Mostly from wallets that held between 1 million to 10 million SHIB in their wallets. Related Reading | FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried Reveals Reason Behind Billions Of Dollars Tether Purchase An interesting fact about this dump was that it had been mostly small traders who were dumping their bags.

The U.S. crypto exchange is launching “Coinbase NFT,” a marketplace that will allow its users to buy and sell Ethereum-based digital collectibles, the company announced Tuesday. Coinbase’s NFT platform is expected to launch by the end of the year, sources told CoinDesk.  The move comes just a day after rival exchange FTX.US announced a marketplace for Solana-based NFTs, with plans to support other blockchains, including Ethereum, in the future.  If FTX’s bet on Solana is a signal that other blockchains are poised to take a slice of Etheruem’s hold on the NFT business, Coinbase is sending a different message – Ethereum’s NFT dominance has room to grow.  Coinbase’s product will take a direct swing at juggernaut marketplace OpenSea, which is currently home to the majority of Ethereum-based NFT trading.  OpenSea has seen remarkable usage during the NFT market’s red-hot run in the past four months, completing as many as 80,000 transactions per day at its peak. For some, however, the experience of navigating a browser-based crypto wallet remains a challenge.  “If you’ve tried to create or purchase an NFT, you’ve probably found the user experience lacking,” Coinbase said in a blog post. “Coinbase NFT will make minting, purchasing, showcasing and discovering NFTs easier than ever.

42396784,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT59UH,1634054411,Dapper Labs Backs $3.5M Raise for Crypto Social Media Startup Yup,"Yup, a crypto-backed social media platform, has raised $3.5 million in a funding round led by Distributed Global, with support from Dapper Labs and a host of prominent angel investors.  Among those angels were Patrick Rivera (of the Web 3 publishing service Mirror), Scott Moore (of Gitcoin), and Nader Al-Naji, the controversial developer behind BitClout and the DeSo blockchain.  Yup works a little like Pinterest, in that it lets users curate content from a variety of different social sites. Installing Yup’s browser extension adds a little button next to posts on Twitter and Facebook; clicking the button lets you assign posts a rating.  Yup also gives users an “Influence Score” out of 100 points – the more points you have, the more influential your ratings. Because it’s backed by crypto, those ratings translate to tokens. The idea is that if you’re among the first people to rate a piece of content, and that content ends up going viral, your curatorial efforts are rewarded with cryptocurrency.  Yup’s founders, Nir Kabessa and Vernon Johnson, began developing the idea for Yup a couple years ago, as members of Columbia’s blockchain research club; the pair graduated last year, at the height of the pandemic.  Kabessa and Johnson used that college connection to snag an investment from Bill Block, the CEO of Miramax and a fellow Columbia alumnus.  “For the average person, it’s very easy to recognize that their tastes, their earliness has value, and is creating value online,” Kabessa told CoinDesk over Zoom. “And we’re giving them a way to monetize that, and directly be rewarded and recognized for participating.”  Crypto social media experiments  When it comes to decentralized social platforms, many have tried, but almost none have succeeded. The most recent attempt came from Al-Naji (also a 20-something Ivy Leaguer) whose blockchain-backed social app BitClout was met with extreme skepticism when it launched earlier this year.  According to Kabessa, Yup is uniquely positioned to solve some of the issues plaguing contemporary social media, particularly misinformation and content moderation.  “Facebook as a platform has a large incentive to not only have you see more content, but have you see more controversial content that causes what they call ‘deep engagement’ and causes you to react,” he explained. “They could easily reduce the quantity of controversial content that you see, but that would directly impact the amount of ads they’re able to sell.”  Yup’s solution is community moderation: a system that lets users decide, collectively, what they do and don’t want to see.  “The question is, can we come to consensus on that together, in sort of a decentralized manner, rather than leaving it up to an organization to be the arbiter of truth?” suggested Kabessa. “Can we reward and recognize curators better, such that we come to a better social consensus on what’s valuable online?”  It’s a nice concept, but it’s also relatively untested. How does community moderation work at scale?  For Yup’s investors, the platform’s central idea – that people want to be rewarded for being early, for being a tastemaker – is very much worth a shot.  “We believe that Web 2 platforms don’t actually want to be the arbiters of truth, but have found themselves in those situations and would like to go back to a place of being a town square,” Kabessa said. “We’ll need to look to decentralized protocols to achieve that.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MINING | RESEARCH,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/12/dapper-labs-backs-35m-raise-for-crypto-social-media-startup-yup,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a6ce3ac0b8ad750c33a755ff4e5fd86f69feb438-4032x1737.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396747,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT59IT,1634052785,"Disney, Electronic Arts, Robinhood, WWE to Benefit Most From NFTs, Citi Says","Companies including Disney, video game publisher Electronic Arts and Robinhood Markets are expected to benefit from non-fungible tokens (NFTs), according to a new report from Citi.  “The advent of NFTs promises significant disruption to any/all sectors with exposure to IP (intellectual property), licensing and merchandise related revenues,” Citi analyst Thomas Singlehurst wrote in a report entitled “Disruptive Innovations,” noting that “the key point is that its decentralized and democratized model allows content owners to disintermediate traditional gatekeepers both in terms of distribution and monetization.”  Citi said that video games and music as industries that are most likely to see positive changes from the influx of NFTs, which are blockchain-based tokens that prove ownership of a piece of digital content. Trading in NFTs climbed to $10.7 billion in the third quarter, an increase of more than 700% from the previous quarter, according to a report by blockchain analytics firm DappRadar.  Other U.S. companies expected to be helped by NFTs include video game publisher Activision, FormulaOne Group, Discovery Inc., ViacomCBS and World Wrestling Entertainment.  Companies in Europe expected to benefit from NFTs include such entities as video game publishers Embracer Group, Frontier Developments, Team17 Group and Ubisoft and ad agencies Publicis Groupe and WPP.  Citi said that those companies either focus on selling content or branded goods, are involved in the creation or trading of NFTs or are service companies that help content creators navigate the NFT market.  Areas and companies that are likely to be hurt by NFTs include video game retailers with physical stores, traditional record labels and music publishers, traditional video and music streaming platforms and “walled garden” online ecosystems. All of those are intermediaries that could be bypassed if content creators had a more direct relationship with their customers, according to the report.  “To be clear, in each case the rise of NFTs is unlikely to be terminal for any of these players, but to the extent that there is pressure on take rates as content ecosystems become more decentralized/democratized, it potentially heralds (relative) pressure on revenues and returns,” Singlehurst wrote.

42394399,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvczAj,1634052600,Biden Wants to Know More About Crypto,"We’re seeing more and more chatter about crypto regulations from the current U.S. presidential administration but, despite certain statements from the SEC chair, the overall approach seems to be “wait and learn” rather than immediate action.  Side note: I’ll be in Washington, D.C., next week for a few days. Want to say hi? Let’s connect!  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Executive intent  The narrative  The Biden administration is continuing to gear up for crypto regulations, with rumors now circulating of a draft executive order that would direct federal agencies to propose rules for the industry.  Why it matters  The executive order would be the broadest effort yet by the administration to rein in a crypto industry seen in regulatory circles as an emerging threat to financial stability. Still, if the description of this order – that it would direct agencies to study and propose recommendations on regulation around crypto – is accurate, it may be another promising sign for the industry at large.  Breaking it down  Rumor has it President Joe Biden may issue an executive order (EO) that would direct federal agencies to study the crypto sector and develop recommendations for regulating it.  First reported by Bloomberg’s Jennifer Epstein and Benjamin Bain, the draft executive order, which may not necessarily be issued, doesn’t seem to go beyond this “study-and-propose” level of regulation, though it is using a wide brush in terms of which parts of the government are involved.  The key takeaway seems to be that the administration wants to know more about crypto, how it works and how it might fit into existing regulations or what new regulations the industry might need. That the administration is taking a wait-and-see approach as opposed to immediately moving to ban or even strictly regulate crypto seems obvious but two details in the possible EO support this idea.  First, the EO, if it is as described, would direct federal agencies to both coordinate their work around digital asset regulation and come up with recommendations for such regulation. We already know the markets and banking regulators have spent years developing guidance and rulemaking around cryptocurrencies, creating futures markets and conditional trust bank charters. More recently, the Department of Justice announced a crypto enforcement group for crimes dealing with digital assets.  What the government now seems to be doing is bringing the Commerce Department and National Science Foundation into the mix, as well as unnamed national security agencies (though even there, entities like the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and Office of Foreign Asset Control have already been active in crypto regulation).  The second detail is the White House is considering appointing a “crypto czar” as part of this coordination effort.  My understanding is this potential EO is meant to get the entirety of the federal government involved in overseeing cryptocurrency. The National Security Council and National Economic Council are both involved, highlighting that the administration is still focused on both possible criminal or national security threats (ransomware falling into both of those categories, for example) and financial stability concerns (such as the oft-repeated concerns with stablecoins).  Generally speaking, I’m hesitant to say whether something is good or bad for crypto, largely because I’m not convinced that “good and bad” is the appropriate framework for discussing events in crypto and partly because if I’m wrong I’m sure someone will tweet a screenshot of this newsletter at me in three years. But in this particular instance I’m going to go out on a limb and say this type of coordination is probably good for crypto.  If nothing else, the fact that so much of the federal government is looking to better understand crypto and hasn’t immediately announced any intention to ban seems like a tacit endorsement of the idea that this industry will have a lasting impact. If this sounds familiar, it’s because I (and a few others) said the same thing after the infrastructure bill debate from this summer.  Moreover, while a lot of attention is (naturally) being paid to criminal activity like ransomware, the response has (so far) been pretty targeted in scope.  That may change of course. If stablecoin issuers do become subject to bank regulations, that could give the federal government de facto authority over which stablecoins can be issued in the U.S. and which cannot. In other words, it could ban any stablecoins the administration doesn’t like.  Even with this soon-to-be-proposed stablecoin regulatory framework, there is a window for businesses to continue operating as they are. The Treasury Department even hopes Congress will take up this effort and pass a law, rather than have the executive branch address the matter through the Financial Stability Oversight Council (which I imagine Sen. Pat Toomey will be thrilled to hear).  And, of course, there’s still the looming infrastructure bill and its crypto tax provision, which does have the Treasury Department’s support. Negotiations are ongoing in the Senate over a second spending bill that would also go toward U.S. infrastructure projects. The fate of the two bills are intertwined right now so it may be a while before we hear anything.  This brings me back to my key takeaways: The latest reported EO seems a natural culmination of what the administration has been building up to since Biden took office some nine months ago.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  Big banks have criticized OCC nominee Saule Omarova for her views on “essentially ending the banking industry as we know it,” reports Politico’s Zachary Warmbrodt.  Other criticism of Omarova has centered around her country of origin (Omarova was born in Kazakhstan while it was part of the former Soviet Union) and references to her undergraduate studies (the Cornell University law professor conducted her undergraduate studies while on a scholarship named after Vladimir Lenin).  Elsewhere:  New Venezuela’s Digital Bolivar Isn’t Digital, and It Won’t Solve the Country’s Economic Crisis: Venezuela rolled out a “digital bolivar,” which proved to be anything but, reports Andrés Engler. This spiritual successor to the nation’s petro digital currency seems to just be an effort to calm the local hyperinflation, but questions still abound over the impact on the local dollar exchange market.  US FDIC Said to Be Studying Deposit Insurance for Stablecoins: The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a federal bank regulator that protects some forms of bank accounts from bank failures, is weighing how it might provide cover for certain stablecoins and for banks that want to issue stablecoins, reports Nate DiCamillo.  Gensler’s Crypto Testimony: 6 Key Takeaways: SEC Chair Gary Gensler testified before the House Financial Services Committee last week. My colleague Cheyenne Ligon covered the key takeaways.  Beyond CoinDesk:  (Bloomberg) Bloomberg’s Zeke Faux dove into Tether’s nearly $70 billion market capitalization and how it got there. Much of this saga has already been reported over the years by CoinDesk and other outlets, but Faux clearly lays out how the last few years have gone, and reveals some of the entities Tether has loaned funds to, such as crypto lender Celsius Network.  (The New York Times) The New York Times took a look at El Salvador’s rollout of its bitcoin law – and the largely popular pushback by El Salvador’s residents against what they see as a government-forced mandate that utilizes a secretly run government wallet.  (The Washington Post) An individual paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy website domain names that closely resemble major cryptocurrency exchanges – except with common typos. This information was revealed as part of the massive Epik hack and information dump, reports The Washington Post. The Post wasn’t able to determine if anyone lost money to these sites, but it’s clear they seem to be aimed at tricking crypto users into putting their credentials into fraudulent sites.

Filled with a rapidly growing number of tools, platforms, and protocols, each designed to boost the utility of cryptocurrencies and provide value to users. But in this complexity, a major obstacle has emerged. Blockchains simply can&apos;t interact with one another. Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Solana, Terra, and dozens more blockchains are effectively operating in isolation, due to a lack of in-built interoperability. This has had a knock-on effect of dividing the blockchain community, who often need to pick and choose which platform to get to grips with and support. As it stands, to interact with services on multiple blockchains, users would need to have at least a basic understanding of how that platform works, hold a wallet, and own at least some of its native assets. Understandably, few individuals and businesses want to go through the hassle of familiarizing themselves with multiple platforms. Over the years, a range of options has been pushed as potential solutions to this challenge. These include interoperability solutions like Polkadot, which enables interblockchain communication by connecting distinct blockchains through a central relay chain. As well as Cosmos&apos; interblockchain communication protocol (ICP), which allows homogeneous blockchains to exchange data and value by providing a single standard for communication.

42412196,KEYN3b06rsSCg2kKkMJOWR,1634043600,Binance Dedicates Another $1B to Smart Chain Project,"Binance is doubling down on its position in Binance Smart Chain (BSC).  Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange by daily trading volume, announced Tuesday that it had committed $1 billion to further boost BSC’s growth, after it put up $100 million to support decentralized finance (DeFi) projects on BSC a little over a year ago.  “BSC’s growth has attracted 100 million more DeFi users with just an initial funding of $100 million,” Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said in a press release. “With the new contribution of $1 billion, it can disrupt traditional finance and accelerate global mass adoption of digital assets to become the first-ever blockchain ecosystem with one billion users.”  According to the news release, the newly launched $1 billion Growth Fund by Binance will be dedicated to four main categories in the BSC’s ecosystem: talent development among the developer communities and crypto investors, liquidity incentive programs to encourage new users to try the smart contract blockchain, tech support including global hackathons and an incubation program for different new projects.  The announcement came after a number of other blockchain projects pushed out their own big-budget incentive programs to boost their ecosystems, including Solana, Avalanche and Fantom, as the layer 1 blockchain competition heats up.  “We’re glad to see more and more projects participate in the decentralized multiverse,” Gwendolyn Regina, investment director of BSC Accelerator Fund, told CoinDesk via a representative. “BSC is a platform for all growing ecosystems, and we want everyone to be a part of it. There’s no competition here.”  Binance is a pioneer in the approach of boosting a blockchain’s ecosystem with big-budget incentive programs. In an effort to tap into the fast-growing DeFi business, Zhao announced Binance’s first round of funds to support BSC last year. Since then, BSC has gained a great amount of traction as one of the more successful “Ethereum killers.”  According to data from BscScan, there are about 98.9 million unique addresses on BSC as of Oct. 10, with a daily transaction number of nearly 6.3 million. As a comparison, there were a total number of nearly 172 million unique addresses on Ethereum on the same day with about 1.1 million daily transactions based on data from Etherscan.  As a public base layer blockchain project supported by Binance, BSC’s success came as Ethereum’s network became too congested and the transaction fees on Ethereum, also known as gas fees, skyrocketed.  BSC has faced criticism for being less decentralized and secure than some of its competitors. There has been a growing number of “rug pulls” or exploits on DeFi projects built on BSC this year, and BSC’s security algorithm, known as Proof-Of-Staked Authority (PoSA) , is controlled by only 21 node operators. But Binance’s Zhao told CoinDesk previously that in designing BSC, the sacrifice of decentralization was unavoidable in order for BSC to compete against Ethereum.  Its performance had also been slowing due to concerns from investors and traders around its security. Although BSC is still the No. 2 blockchain by total value locked (TVL), it is far off its all-time TVL high reached in early May. TVL is the value of the crypto assets that are locked in DeFi protocols on the blockchain.  “With the $1 billion initiative, our focus will be widened to building cross-chain and multi-chain infrastructures integrated with different types of blockchains,” Regina said in the release.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | BNB,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/12/binance-dedicates-another-1b-to-smart-chain-project,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6e54e739a7b49826cbdcad5e2fc704c9d2d24924-1440x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412191,KEYN3b06rsSCg2kKkMJO5j,1634040000,Sam Bankman-Fried Hands Control of Crypto Trading Firm Alameda to Two Deputies,"Sam Bankman-Fried is stepping back from his quant trading shop Alameda Research to make room for two co-CEOs: Caroline Ellison and Sam Trabucco.  The pair, both traders with pre-crypto ties to Bankman-Fried, will oversee Alameda’s vast network of trading, yield farming, startup investments and market making. Alameda is one of the crypto landscape’s trading behemoths, booking a $1 billion profit last year, according to Forbes.  Alameda Research was Bankman-Fried’s launch pad into the crypto big leagues. He created the firm in 2017 to exploit crypto arbitrage opportunities, hiring Ellison, who worked with him at Jane Street in 2018, and Trabucco, a Susquehanna bond trader and friend from MIT, one year later.  Their ascendence is more a formalization of Alameda’s C-suite than a reorganization, according to Trabucco. He said Bankman-Fried has been fully dedicated to running his crypto exchange FTX since it launched in 2020.  “Once FTX got started, it was sort of using all his time,” Trabucco said.  He provided an estimate of Bankman-Fried’s current time allocations: “2% on Alameda; 98% on FTX.”  Nothing much will change at Alameda now that he and Ellison are formally in control, Trabucco said. The firm, which trades billions of dollars in crypto markets daily, will still be focused on generating large returns.  “Everything we do is because we think it will make us money,” Trabucco said. He described Alameda as an opportunistic firm ready to act on whichever strategy best achieves that goal.  For the last few months, the best route has been riding the volatility game in the “normal crypto markets.”  “Really short term, that’s what I expect us to be doing,” Trabucco said. But it has no shortage of money-making means.  Alameda is to the crypto market what Citadel and Susquehanna are for traditional equities: a behind-the-scenes quant-trading and market-making giant. But those firms refuse to touch crypto; Ken Griffin of Citadel says the U.S. crypto regulatory landscape is just too murky.  Trabucco is less spooked by regulatory concerns.

It’s the credibility that comes with the people who wrote those cheques.”  Last year, the company raised $30 million in an equity round led by Tether at a pre-money valuation of $120 million.  The crypto lender has been subject to multiple moves by state regulators in the U.S, in response to its lending products.  Last month, Celsius Network received a cease-and-desist order from Kentucky’s securities regulator over interest earned on certain crypto accounts. The regulator says the accounts violate securities laws and fail to disclose to customers what happens to their deposits and whether they are protected.

While bitcoin has gained 30% this month, the user activity on the network, as measured by the seven-day average of the number of active entities, has increased 19% to 284,179, according to data provided by Glassnode.  An increase in network adoption along with a price increase is said to confirm the uptrend.  “More active market participants has historically correlated with growing interest in the asset during early-stage bull markets,” Glassnode wrote.  Glassnode defines active entities as a “cluster of addresses controlled by the same network entity.” The metric includes both businesses like exchanges and custodians and individuals.  The current tally of active entities is the highest in five months and on par with the number observed at the beginning of the bull run in late 2020.  Institutional participation has increased along with network adoption, as evidenced by the uptick in the median size of on-chain transactions from 0.6 BTC to 1.3 BTC since September.  “An increased typical transaction size is not synonymous with price appreciation, but indicative of larger and even institutional sized capital flows present on-chain,” Glassnode said, adding that the dollar value of the average transaction size has also increased.  The technical outlook appears to be in sync with the bullish on-chain data, with the 100- and 200-day moving averages (MA) on track to print a bullish crossover in the next few days for the first time in 16 months.  A bull cross occurs when a particular moving average crosses above another average tracking a relatively higher amount of backward-looking data.  The impending bull cross of the 100- and 200-day MAs is widely taken to represent a long-term bull market and may soon invite stronger chart-driven buying pressure.  A 10-month bull run from $8,300 to $64,801 followed the previous bullish signal confirmed in June 2020. The cryptocurrency nearly doubled to $13,880 after the bull cross of 100- and 200-day MAs in early May 2019.  Moving average crossovers, whether bullish or bearish, are not always reliable. These are lagging indicators and sometimes trap traders on the wrong side of the market.

42411905,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgwtk,1634030425,What Is a 51% Attack?,"An attack on a blockchain by a group of miners controlling over 50% of a network’s mining hashrate – the sum of all computing power dedicated to mining and processing transactions – is called a 51% attack.  A blockchain is a type of ledger technology that stores and records data. Put simply, a blockchain is a distributed list of transactions that is constantly being updated and reviewed. One of the key features of a blockchain is that it is made up of a decentralized network of nodes (a crucial piece of ensuring that a cryptocurrency remains decentralized and secure).  Understanding decentralization  A blockchain is decentralized in that no single person or select group of people controls the blockchain network. That decentralization is important because all participants on the blockchain need to agree on the current state of the blockchain. By requiring an entire network of distributed participants to come to the same agreement, the validity of the block’s state can be certain.  Think of it as asking for a movie recommendation. If you were to ask someone if a particular movie was good and they reply yes, it could still be terrible. But if you were to ask 1,000 different people about the movie and they all said yes, then there’s a far better chance the movie is, in fact, good because it’s been unanimously verified. For proof-of-work (PoW) blockchains like Bitcoin, this “consensus” assures that a miner can validate a new block of transactions only if the network nodes agree on the block’s validity. Such consensus algorithms are the picky movie critics of the blockchain world: They will see the new movie only if everyone agrees that it was good. The consensus algorithm, however, merely asks “everybody,” regardless of whether everybody is 10 people or a billion. If a majority agree that the movie was good, then the algorithm will agree with it.  The mining process  In our example above, “everybody” for a PoW blockchain means all the mining nodes, or “miners.” These miners are competing against each other by using their machines to generate a code (known as a hash) that has an equal or higher number of zeros at the front than the target hash (the code every miner needs to beat). Whoever produces the winning hash that beats the target hash wins the right to fill a new block with transaction data and earn free crypto and transaction fees in return.  Read more: How Bitcoin Mining Works  Miners with more machines or those with machines that have a higher hashrate (capable of producing more hashes per second) have a greater chance of beating the target hash and winning the right to fill the next block with transaction data and adding it to the chain. This is similar in a way to a lottery system where a person with 10,000 tickets has a greater chance of winning versus someone who has only five tickets.  But what happens when a malicious agent manages to gain majority control of the hashrate?  The 51% Attacks!  A 51% attack, also known as a majority attack, occurs when a single person or group of people gains control of over 50% of a blockchain’s hashing power. That is usually achieved by renting mining hash power from a third party.  Successful attackers gain the ability to block new transactions from being confirmed as well as change the ordering of new transactions. It also allows the malicious agents to essentially rewrite parts of the blockchain and reverse their own transactions, leading to an issue known as double spending. This problem was traditionally an issue faced mostly by electronic payments where a network was incapable of proving that two or more people didn’t spend the same digital asset.  A 51% attack, however, is theoretically limited in the amount of disruption it can cause. While the attacker could trigger the double-spending problem, they cannot reverse others’ transactions on the network or prevent users from broadcasting their transactions to the network. Additionally, a 51% attack is incapable of creating new assets, stealing assets from unrelated parties or altering the functionality of block rewards.  Likelihood of a 51% attack  As a blockchain network grows and acquires news mining nodes it makes the chances of a 51% attack taking place less likely. That is because the cost of performing a 51% attack rises in tandem with the network hashrate (the amount of computational power committed to the network). Essentially, the bigger the network and the more nodes there are participating in it, the more hash power is needed to control over 50% of it.  But even if an attacker were to reach above 50% of the hashrate, the size of a blockchain could still provide security. Because blocks are linked together in the chain, a block can be altered only if all subsequently confirmed blocks are eliminated.  While possible, doing so would be incredibly costly for the attacker for two reasons:  The attacker would have to expend great amounts of computing power (cost of electricity) to achieve a 51% hashrate, particularly on larger more established networks  Because the miner is not acting in a way that participates appropriately, they would no longer be receiving the blockchain rewards that come with mining  Thus, the more significant number of transactions there are, the more blocks are on the chain and the more difficult it is to alter a block.  While the threat of a 51% attack still exists (albeit extremely unlikely) on big blockchains like Bitcoin, the financial costs would far outweigh the benefits. Even if an attacker were to expend all of its resources to attack a blockchain, the constant addition of blocks to the chain would give only a relatively small window to a number of transactions for the attacker to alter.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Griffin Mcshane,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-51-attack,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/974012309f4c1652759c1eb4132cfd505a89fc55-2000x1500.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Most DeFi projects allow users to stake one cryptocurrency in a liquidity pool to earn a different token with their interchain operability. However, only a few projects have mastered this concept, and Aurum is one of them. Aurum is a DeFi project with an aim to set GOLD standards for reward tokenomics and BSC security. The project operates on the three principles, decentralization, robust security and unparalleled rewards to offer a seamless and rewarding experience to the users. The great thing with Aurum is its ability to allow the $AUR token holders to choose their own automatically redistributed BEP-20 token reward. While the native reward token for holding $AUR is BNB, users can diversify their pools of investments by adding the contact address of any BEP-20 token of their preference. Users can choose from large-cap tokens such as ETH, Binance pegged BTC, ADA, LINK, DeFi tokens such as CAKE, BANANA or stablecoins such as USD. Aurum Pressure Vault Aurum Pressure Vault harnesses the power of Aurum&apos;s rewards system to create ultimate buy pressure for any Binance Smart Chain Project.

42412181,KEYN3b06rsSCg2kKkMJNjT,1634000177,"A16z Crypto Names 2 Security Veterans to Ensure Robust Measures, Provide Guidance","A16z Crypto has added two technology security experts to its operations team, Anthony Albanese, the COO of the cryptocurrency-focused unit of the venture giant, wrote in a blog post on the company’s website Monday.  Nassim Eddequiouaq will serve as a16z Crypto’s chief information security officer (CISO), while Riyaz Faizullabhoy will be its chief technology officer (CTO). They will help ensure that projects in a16z Crypto’s portfolio meet rigorous security measures, and provide technical guidance.  They are the latest additions for a16z Crypto, which has made a number of high-profile hirings over the past year as it expands its reach.  In a16z Crypto’s June announcement of a $2.2 billion raise for its much-anticipated Crypto Fund III, it also said it had added five heavy hitters to its team.  They include: Bill Hinman, the former director of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Division of Corporation Finance, as an advisory partner; Tomicah Tillemann, a former senior adviser to then-Sen. Joe Biden and two secretaries of state, as global head of policy; and former Coinbase VP of Communications Rachael Horwitz as the operating partner overseeing marketing and communications.  Albanese joined a16z in October after serving as chief regulatory officer at the New York Stock Exchange.  Eddequiouaq and Faizullabhoy join a16z Crypto from Facebook, where they created the crypto custody infrastructure for the Novi wallet (formerly called Calibra). They also worked together at the cryptocurrency custody firm Anchorage, where they received their introduction to cryptocurrency.  In his blog post, Albanese said the firm had been seeking “a world-class security leader to consult with the projects in our portfolio and help our own operations scale in a crypto-native way, and were doubly fortunate to find a pair of them instead.” He called Eddequiouaq and Faizullabhoy “phenomenal engineering and security leaders with a proven track record in blockchain and infrastructure.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,James Rubin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/12/a16z-crypto-names-2-security-veterans-to-ensure-robust-measures-provide-guidance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/adae1dafe8ef72e58eca04a2eec6e3f1dca16a04-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
