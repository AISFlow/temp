42399068,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiCUS,1464897341,"CFTC Fines Bitcoin Exchange Bitfinex $75,000 Over Trading Violations","Hong Kong-based bitcoin exchange Bitfinex has settled with the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) following an investigation into its financed trading activities.  Bitfinex settled charges that it offered illegal off-exchange financed retail commodities trading, as well as failed to register as a futures commission merchant. Bitfinex did not admit or deny the CFTC findings, the agency said today.  According to an order published today by the CFTC, the issues arose owing to how Bitfinex held functional control over funds tied to leveraged or margin trading on the platform. The CFTC said that because no actual commodities were delivered by Bitfinex to its customers – the private keys tied to the applicable bitcoins remained under the exchange’s control – it was in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act.  Bitfinex will pay $75,000 in civil penalties, according to the order, and has moved to change its internal policies and avoid further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act.  The CFTC said a statement:  “The Order finds that from April 2013 to at least February 2016, Bitfinex permitted users to borrow funds from other users on the platform in order to trade bitcoins on a leveraged, margined, or financed basis. The Order also finds that Bitfinex did not actually deliver those bitcoins to the traders who purchased them. Instead, Bitfinex held the bitcoins in deposit wallets that it owned and controlled, the Order states.”  A futures commission merchant, according to the National Futures Association, is an entity that is authorized to sell or accept money for these kinds of financial products. According to the CFTC, Bitfinex did not register before offering this type of service.  The settlement comes months after rumors circulated that the CFTC was investigating Bitfinex.  In September, an anonymous tipster posted on social media about the then-rumored investigation, sharing a link to an email attributed to CFTC trial attorney Michael Frisch. Frisch’s name appears among the CFTC staffers listed on the agency’s press release regarding the settlement.  It was around this time that the exchange first contacted the CFTC, according to the order. The agency went on to say that the company was proactive in its cooperation.  Bitfinex, which according to data from Bitcoinity is the largest bitcoin exchange by US dollar trade volume, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a statement posted to its website, the exchange outlined the settlement and said that it had moved to address what the CFTC was investigating.  ""In response to these constructive discussions with the CFTC’s Division of Enforcement, BFXNA has made significant changes to the way in which US customers engage in financed trading on Bitfinex. Bitfinex remains committed to continually improving its customers’ experience while complying with applicable laws and regulatory requirements,"" the company wrote.  In September  , the CFTC moved to assert its jurisdiction over bitcoin and digital currencies, classifying them as commodities under the Commodity Exchange Act.

42399066,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiCSU,1464890681,London School of Economics Paper Says Blockchain Could Reduce Custody Risks,"A new paper from the London School of Economics argues that the existing infrastructure for holding and transmitting securities puts asset owners at risk – and that blockchain applications could alleviate some of these problems should adoption take place.  Penned by Eva Micheler of the LSE’s Law Department and Luke von der Heyde of South Africa-based law firm ENSafrica, the paper posits that while the evolution from paper-based securities to wholly electronic settlement led to faster communication times, there have been negative trade-offs along the way.  According to the authors, ""computers have all but eliminated transaction risk while at the same time introducing custody risk"".  The application of the technology to securities trading and settlement has attracted significant attention from the financial industry worldwide. A number of banks have been testing blockchain-based systems and prototypes, and more than a few startups working in the industry are devoted to this specific application.  According to the paper, the technology offers possible benefits to those actually buying and selling securities, at the potential cost of intermediaries who charge fees along the way.  The authors write:  ""There is no need for separate trading, clearing and settlement venues. There is no exposure to the risk of any one central provider failing. Buyer and seller can interact directly with each other. They can exchange securities and cash directly and in real time.""  Digital risks  Micheler and Von der Heyde argue that despite the gains in communication speeds, the current securities settlement environment has resulted in investors becoming ""investors separated from issuers through intermediation"".  ""This has made the enforcement of rights very difficult if not outright impossible. It stands in the way of shareholders exercising voting rights. Investors bear the risk associated with all intermediaries that operate between them and the issuer,"" the authors state, going on to argue:  “Regulators struggle to keep up with increasing levels of intermediation spanning across borders. The introduction of computers has made trading easy, but holding assets more difficult.”  Further, the paper argues, it’s the digitization itself that has led to wider networks of intermediaries, further fueling these issues. These problems related to investor rights, the authors go on to say, extend to scenarios in which an issuer encounters financial problems.  Early stages  Echoing similar sentiments within the securities industry, Micheler and Von der Heyde note that applications are primarily in the early stages, and any broader usage is subject to the shifting regulatory and market landscape.  However, they close by arguing that asset owners should play a role in assessing the technology’s use for the securities sector alongside market incumbents and regulators.  The report concludes:  “And finally leaving regulators aside the ball is in the court of asset owners[,] some of whom have the muscle to ask questions about how their assets are held. They are also able to involve themselves in the current discussion about how the new technology, if it is to be used, should be implemented.”  The full paper can be found below:    Holding, Clearing and Settling Securities Through Blockchain Technology    Image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2016/06/02/london-school-of-economics-paper-says-blockchain-could-reduce-custody-risks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bd32e4d5ebe01594026acf674c11352b7c3f4d70-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42399055,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiCHf,1464887250,Coinbase and ARK Invest Report Argues Bitcoin is a New Kind of Asset Class,"A new report argues that bitcoin should be considered the first in a new kind of asset class.  The paper was produced by digital currency exchange and wallet startup Coinbase and ARK Invest, an investment management firm that specializes in disruptive technologies and offers financial products tied to bitcoin.  The white paper  , written using data from Coinbase, TradeBlock, the S&P 500 Index and several additional industry benchmarks, outlines four approaches to characterizing assets before laying out the argument that traditional investors should view ""cryptocurrency"" as an entirely new asset class.  ARK Invest analyst Chris Burniske, who co-authored the report, said that the project started as an exploration between the two companies of how people use gold to buy bitcoin.  Burniske told CoinDesk:  ""We realized this is a bigger story than comparing bitcoin and gold. This is about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies maturing into their own asset class.""  The new report builds on a 1997 paper about asset class characterization, which breaks down assets into three categories: capital assets, consumable/ transformable assets, and store-of-value assets.  Burniske and co-author Adam White, who serves as vice president for Coinbase, go on to define four distinct characteristics of traditional asset classes, positioning bitcoin both within and beyond those traditional definitions.  Liquidity and distinctness  The first characteristic of an asset class that the report outlines relates to what it calls “investability”. This, according to the report, pertains to whether an asset class provides sufficient liquidity and opportunity to invest.  In the case of bitcoin, ARK Invest and Coinbase analyzed bitcoin exchange trading volumes from July 2011 through the first quarter of 2016 to determine the liquidity available to investors.  Using data obtained from Bitcoinity and Tradeblock’s XBX Index, the paper shows steadily increasing volume, reaching as much as $1b per day through April of this year – though it acknowledges that this high figure is driven by self-reported figures not subject to third-party validation.  Next, the report defines a traditional currency relative to its “politico-economic features”. To be an asset, the report argues, the entity needs to have a unique profile that “arises” from its value, governance and use cases.  In each case, the report draws distinctions between bitcoin and traditional asset classes.  For example, bitcoin’s operational model, in which transactions are broadcast and verified on an open network, results in a predictable, ""mathematically metered"" release of the asset. By 2140, 21m bitcoins in the market will exist – by comparison, roughly 15.6m bitcoins have been created to date.  According to figures provided in the paper, that’s distinct from both the US monetary base and gold supply, which increase at sporadic rates based on data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and Number Sleuth’s ""All the World’s Gold Facts"".  The report argues:  ""Compared to bitcoin, no asset has evolved from concept to billions of dollars in stored value so quickly. Moreover, no asset in history has followed such a predictable supply trajectory.""  Sufficiently different  The third trait used in the report to define traditional assets and help position cryptocurrencies as a new asset class relates to “price independence”, a characteristic that suggest how assets should exhibit a low correlation on returns relative to other assets in the marketplace.  Put more simply, an asset needs to be sufficiently independent from the value of other existing assets.  Using data sourced from Bloomberg and TradeBlock, ARK Invest and Coinbase compare bitcoin with the S&P 500, along with data on US bonds, gold, real estate, oil, and emerging market currencies.  “Strikingly, bitcoin’s price movements have been separate and distinct from those of other asset classes during the last five years,” the report states. “It is the only asset that maintains consistently low correlations with every other asset.”  Lastly, ARK Invest and Coinbase argue that the first three characteristics of traditional asset classes need to differentiate the risk-reward profile of the entity, leading to easily defined returns and a degree of volatility.  Using the Sharpe Ratio, which measures the returns on an investment per unit of risk, the authors of the report analyzed a five-year span from May 2011 through May 2016.  With data sourced from the XBX Index, the report shows that, during the five-year period, the average daily volatility compared to the previous year decreased from about 10% to about 4%.  Bitcoin’s daily volatility in May 2016 was roughly a third of that figure compared to five years ago, and 24% less than at the start of May 2015, according to the paper.

42399065,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiCRV,1464879912,EU Watchdog: Distributed Ledgers Still Face Key Challenges,"The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), a securities trade watchdog based in the EU, has released a new discussion paper on blockchains and distributed ledgers as part of a fact-finding effort aimed at developing policy positions on the technologies.  The paper, published today, comes more than a year after the organization first issued a call for information on the technology. ESMA has also hosted its own events, as well as participated in others focused on the use of blockchain applications in finance.  ESMA’s fact-finding mission itself grew out of an effort to investigate digital currency investments in the EU, which in the newest report ESMA said ""remained marginal"" overall.  The agency stressed throughout its new report that it had not developed a concrete opinion on the technology, framing the release as one that constitutes a ""preliminary analysis"" of blockchain applications to the securities sector. Each section is built out with a series of questions to industry stakeholders as part of the agency’s comment-seeking process.  The report states:  ""ESMA appreciates that the [distributed ledger technology] may have different applications and impacts on financial activities, market participants and market infrastructures, depending on a variety of elements, including its capacity to address a number of technical, governance, legal and regulatory issues. It is too early at this stage to form a definite opinion on whether the DLT will be able to address these issues in an efficient way.""  Overall, the report echoes other assessments, including those of its own executive director, on the technology’s potential in finance.  It posits that the technology could be leveraged to boost systemic efficiency, reduce intermediation in the clearing and settlement process and improve transparency in trade data recordkeeping. At the same time, the ESMA report raises questions about scaling, governance and cybersecurity issues.  ""ESMA believes that the DLT will need to overcome a number of possible challenges and shortcomings before its benefits can be reaped,"" the report’s authors write. ""Some of these challenges are related to the technology itself.""  Notably, the report explores which regulatory frameworks within the EU that could apply to market applications of blockchain tech should it see wider adoption. These include the Central Securities Depositories Regulation (CSDR), the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) and the Settlement Finality Directive (SFD).

42399056,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiCIe,1464859962,R3 Adds Life Insurance Firm AIA to Blockchain Consortium,"Blockchain startup R3CEV has added Hong Kong-based life insurance group AIA to the ranks of its global banking consortium.  The announcement comes at a time when R3 is increasing its presence in Asia as well as diversifying its portfolio of participating financial institutions, having added China-based Ping An Insurance Group to its consortium in late May.  In statements, R3 CEO David Rutter echoed this sentiment in remarks, seeking to position the move as one that adds new stakeholders to its conversation. In addition to creating in-house technologies, such as the smart contract distributed ledger Corda, R3 provides consultancy and research services.  Such resources were key to striking the deal with AIA, according to its chief operations officer Simeon Preston, who said:  ""R3 provides us the possibility to understand together with other leading global organisations in financial services the potential applications of blockchain technology around the world and particularly in the Asia-Pacific region.""  The move by China and Hong Kong-based financial institutions further coincides with what appears to be growing interest among similar businesses across Asia. Japan, for instance, has seen a number of its bitcoin and blockchain startups raise funding in recent weeks, while its banks have been active in announcing proofs-of-concept.
