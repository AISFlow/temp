15990236,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/china-trigger-cobra-effect,1507372431,Could China Trigger a ‘Cobra Effect’?,"By now, we have all accepted the news that China has banned all ICO’s, and shut down all cryptocurrency exchanges. Although they did this as a way of preventing Chinese citizens from incurring any financial losses, they should be wary of causing a Cobra Effect. So, what is the Cobra Effect? Simply put, the Cobra Effect will occur when an attempted solution to a problem actually makes the problem worse. This results in an unintended consequence. The term originated as an interesting anecdote about the British rule of India. The British government was worried about the large number of highly venomous cobras in the city of Delhi, India, and came up with a brilliant idea that they would offer a reward for every dead cobra. Because a reward was being offered, it resulted in people killing the cobras in order to claim the reward, which soon resulted in unforeseen problems for the British government. Instead of dealing with the already large numbers of cobras that were already in the city, many actually begin to breed cobras, just to kill them to claim the rewards. Once the British government realised that this was happening, they soon put a stop to the rewards, but what this actually resulted in was an increased cobra population, as they were just being released into the wild. So, what actually started as an idea to solve the problem, actually ended up making the situation far, far worse. So, why could this be a problem? Failing to consider the secondary effects of something, can result in unplanned surprises. Because most cryptocurrency trades take place at exchanges, the Chinese government may have thought that by shutting down all of the exchanges, it will decrease the number of people investing in cryptocurrencies; but in reality, what it might result in is the Chinese population finding illegal ways of investing in these cryptocurrencies, which could have a much more negative effect than they first thought. Is there a solution? The motivation for the Chinese government to ban ICO’s and shut down cryptocurrency exchanges is simple - they are attempting to make it more difficult for ordinary citizens to buy cryptocurrencies, making it less popular. In the short term; this has worked. There has been a temporary blip in the number of people trading in Bitcoin, which has seen the price fall, but it is near impossible to say how long this will last, and, in fact, the price of Bitcoin has already started to climb again. It is possible though that taking the decision to shut down all cryptocurrency exchanges will result in those who wish to buy Bitcoins to enter into PTP trades. These are actually far riskier and come with a much higher risk of fraud, which could have a much more detrimental effect on the Chinese financial sector.

42400504,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJo4e,1507366216,Ethereum Developers Optimistic Ahead of Byzantium Blockchain Fork,"Ethereum's core developers assembled yesterday for a final scheduled meeting before the blockchain network, the world's second-largest by total value, undergoes its next upgrade, expected on October 16.  Held via Google Hangouts at 14:00 UTC, the discussion centered on ensuring all ethereum clients upgrade their software in unison so as to avoid any unintended splits. For the fork to occur across all nodes uniformly, clients need to include the necessary changes that accompany the upgrade – called Byzantium – as well as the trigger at block number 4,370,000 that will mark the official shift to the new code.  Once complete, the hard fork will introduce improvements to ethereum, such as making the network faster with fewer data constraints. Additionally, Byzantium – which constitutes the first of two releases in the wider Metropolis upgrade – will ramify security measures and implement new variables that might pave the way for enhanced privacy on the network.  But while past upgrades have proven more complicated, according to today's discussion, developers expect clients that have yet to release an update expect to do so by next week. Already, the network's most popular client, Go Ethereum (Geth) has published its release.  Further, though the deadline might seem to mark a challenge for client developers, the core development team believes the later release will favor the upgrade by keeping it top of mind.  The meeting did reveal some hiccups, however. For example, there was the realization that some client developers had forgotten to test their software against the lower mining difficulty level that will be introduced in Byzantium.  Still, while no meetings are scheduled between now and the fork, developers left the door open to other conversations – if only in the event of an emergency.  Meeting chairman Hudson Jameson concluded:  ""We'll talk at the hard fork if something goes wrong, otherwise, we'll talk on the 20th.""

42400510,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJoAY,1507363216,Bitcoin Meets Netflix? Laolu Is Building a Lightning-Powered App for That,"A principal developer of the Lightning Network, Olaoluwa ""Laolu"" Osuntokun is understandably interested in tools that could be made possible by bitcoin.  But while most developers have been focused on ironing out bitcoin's much-discussed protocol-level problems, Osuntokun is taking a notable step in that he is actually considering launching a production application on top of the network. Despite the volatility of the scaling debate, and the uncertainty of just how many forks there will be, Osuntokun is going so far as to conceive of a video app that could disrupt the traditional digital advertising model, one he believes is possible with tools available today.  Key to realizing his vision has been recent updates to the bitcoin protocol.  Following the activation of Segregated Witness (SegWit), which went live on bitcoin in August, the Lightning Network is now closer to launch, meaning apps that rely on the need to process high volumes of transactions could soon be built on the network.  But even with the Lightning Network not quite operational, engineers can use the open-source code to start developing apps, a variety of which have cropped up in the past several months. Several of these apps look to take on digital media (someone even a created a fake version of CoinDesk).  So, while a long line of projects, including Streamium and Yours have tried to use bitcoin micropayments to pay for various types of online content, right now, bitcoin's transaction fees make low-value payments infeasible.  The Lightning Network, then, as developers like Osuntokun have realized, could be the solution.  Osuntokun told CoinDesk:  ""The value is that I can essentially create a bounty off-chain or on-chain for a particular piece of media, whether it be an image or video. The structure outlined requires zero log-in or sign-up, as the payment itself acts as spam prevention.""  And while that may seem technical, Osuntokun said there could a more understandable impact.  Long term, he believes allowing people to access video, not with logins and passwords, but with payments, could mean the end of those annoying YouTube ads.  The technicals  Developing Lightning-based apps doesn't come without a good amount of technical work, though.  To make his video app work, Osuntokun had to recreate the MPEG-DASH protocol, which allows for the efficient sending of video (whether live, like a news broadcast, or stored, like an episode of ""Rick and Morty"") over the web.  It's a technique known for playing video without stops and stutters or obnoxious loading bars by splitting each video into segments of 2–10 seconds in length, then using the attached media presentation description (MPD) to rebuild the video as it's transported to the individual computer.  In Osuntokun's version, called HTLC-DASH, micropayments – by way of Lightning Labs' software implementation of Lightning, LND – are added to the video sending technique.  The payments are made mandatory via ""hashed timelock contracts,"" a basic component of the Lightning Network, meaning that users pay for the video content they're watching automatically.  Osuntokun plans to add several other technical features to the application soon, including affixing micropayment information to the MPD for each slice of data. As you might expect, the bigger the chunk of data, the more it costs.  He is also looking for a distributed system to store videos, and listed BitTorrent, Blockstack and IPFS as possible storage options over single servers.  The benefits  One of the more interesting claims Osuntokun made is that Lightning Network offers an easier interface for developers to work with than bitcoin's ""layer-one."" For instance, developers don't need to ""worry"" about other bumps that only occur on bitcoin, such as ""unconfirmed"" and ""chained"" transactions.  As such, Lightning offers developers the ability to add a payment method to their projects more easily, he said.  Osuntokun explained:  ""Constructions such as HTLC-DASH really show the added utility things like Lightning add to bitcoin. I think we'll see the community continue to explore the new applications and use cases that Lightning unlocks for bitcoin.""  And with those proved through the video app (and others), he believes more and more apps incorporating Lightning instead of the ""normal"" bitcoin will pop up.  Yet, those benefits are still some time away, since the protocol level of Lightning needs significant work, that's where Osuntokun will spend most of his time and energy in the coming months.  In particular, he and the Lightning Labs team are working on the first version of LND that works on the bitcoin mainnet, which will mark a huge step forward for the mechanism that's so far been considered too unsafe to use outside of a testing environment.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Blockstack and Protocol Labs, which develops IPFS.
