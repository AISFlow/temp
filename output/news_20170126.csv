42379189,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nQsV,1485465307,Bitcoin Startup Xapo Gets Nod of Approval from Swiss Finance Regulator,"Bitcoin wallet company Xapo announced today that it has received an early nod of approval from a key Swiss regulator.  The Switzerland-based company said in a new blog post that it has been given “conditional approval” from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) to do business in the European country.  The approval isn’t final, however, as Xapo said the regulator wants to see it join a self-regulatory organization (SRO), among other steps. Xapo relocated to Switzerland in mid-2015, citing customer privacy concerns at the time as it looked to shift away from its operations in Palo Alto, California.  In the blog, CEO Wences Casares wrote that the company is “optimistic that we will meet the required conditions”.  Casares went on to write:  “We wish to commend FINMA on their professionalism throughout the approval process. Since the beginning, FINMA personnel have acted in a proactive, collaborative and transparent manner; while Xapo did not always receive the answers it wanted, we always received answers grounded in reason, law and fealty to the principle of consumer protection.”  The development represents the latest positive sign out of Switzerland for companies looking to work with the tech.  The past several months have seen a major Swiss rail operator offer bitcoin buying services through its ticket kiosks and one of the country’s telecoms join the Hyperledger blockchain project. As well, Swiss regulators continue to push for the development of a more open environment in a bid to attract startups.  Xapo was not immediately available for comment when reached.

42379179,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nQef,1485454560,The IRS is Trying to Keep Coinbase From Defending its Customer Data,"Coinbase officially entered the fray in a court case over its user records earlier this month – and now the IRS is fighting back.  In a 25th January court filing, lawyers for the US government argued that the San Francisco-based startup has no standing to intervene in the so-called ""John Doe"" summons case, through which the IRS is seeking bitcoin user records in a bid to identify potential tax cheats.  The case, which saw Coinbase customer Jeff Berns file his own intervention effort late last year, has drawn harsh criticism from digital currency advocates amid accusations of overreach.  Yet in its filing, the US tax agency is arguing that Coinbase doesn’t have a legal leg to stand on, citing the powers granted to it by Congress as part of its tax investigations.  The filing reads:  ""The comprehensive statutory scheme governing the issuance and enforcement of Internal Revenue Service administrative summonses does not allow movants such as Mr. Berns or Coinbase to intervene in closed ex parte proceedings and does not create jurisdiction in this Court to grant them the relief they seek. Furthermore, Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure does not give Coinbase the necessary standing to seek relief.""  More specifically, government lawyers argued in their filing that the kind of case it filed in California would, in its view, preclude either Coinbase or Berns from attempting to intervene.  ""The proceeding before the district court is ex parte, and the district court makes its determination whether the statutory requirements have been satisfied solely on the basis of the government’s petition and its supporting affidavits,"" the lawyers wrote.  The IRS first filed suit in November, seeking permission to serve Coinbase with a summons – a request Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley went on to grant. Berns filed his motion to intervene in December, a move the IRS quickly asked the court to rebuff.  Coinbase declined to comment when reached.

42379182,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nQfv,1485447553,LendingRobot is Moving Investment Records to a Public Blockchain,"Alternative lending platform LendingRobot has taken its first step toward moving the assets it currently manages to a blockchain.  As part of its newly launched LendingRobot Series of investment products, the platform – which has $120m worth of assets currently deployed – will begin to post detailed accounts of some of its investments to the public ethereum blockchain.  The investments themselves will still be conducted off-blockchain using the P2P lender’s existing infrastructure. But the process of hashing detailed, anonymized accounting records to a blockchain marks the beginning of a broader plan.  In conversation with CoinDesk, LendingRobot co-founder and CEO Emmanuel Marot explained how moving some of the workload to a blockchain in the future could make the platform more trustworthy, while at the same time providing opportunities for increased revenue.  ""We’ve got machine learning to make the selection, we’ve got cloud computing to do the execution, and the reporting is a mix of web interface, mobile application, and the blockchain technology to ensure that we are not lying about anything,"" Marot said, adding:  ""Moving forward, I would love to be able to make the execution layer itself by smart contracts.""  Currently, LendingRobot uses a machine-learning algorithm to identify lending opportunities made available to non-bank creditors by way of platforms such as Lending Club, Prosper, and Funding Circle. Then, the firm executes those loans using Amazon’s S3 cloud computing platform, reaching 6,500 clients.  With the LendingRobot Series of investments announced today, the data will be hashed on the ethereum blockchain to establish the “proof-of-state” for the entire portfolio.  LendingRobot, which has raised more than $3m in venture funding to date, plans to hash its first data on the ethereum blockchain when the first loan in the series takes place, which the company expects will occur next week.  From there, the startup will publish the anonymized data every week moving forward.  Harder to cheat?  Clients will be able to download a file of the data from the Amazon platform with a record of the hash alongside each file. Investors and auditors can then take the downloaded file, run it through the same hash algorithm the company uses, and verify that the hash matches.  After testing the SHA3_512 hashing algorithms, LendingRobot selected the BLAKE2 algorithm co-developed by Zcash founder Zooko Wilcox to encode its records.  ""This is where the blockchain comes in,"" said LendingRobot technical lead Kevin Audleman. ""When we publish the hash of our ledger, we also perform a blockchain transaction that includes the hash in an easily-verifiable way. This creates a permanent, immutable proof of the state of our ledger.""  For the time being, trust in LendingRobot is still required. But not for long, if Marot gets his way.  Citing concerns highlighted by the ouster of Lending Club co-founder Renaud Laplanche last year, Marot says non-banking lenders need a better way to be able to trust the companies that connect them with borrowers.  In the case of Laplanche, he was accused of falsifying numbers in order to to make a $22m lending opportunity look more advantageous than it likely was.  In order to make P2P lending truly trustless, Marot says two things need to happen. First, the execution of the loan itself needs to move to autonomous code, or smart contracts, run directly on the blockchain.  Second, his counterparties at Lending Club, Prosper, and Funding Circle need to embrace the tech as well.  ""I do hope that lending will go to this, the platforms themselves contributing to this,"" Marot said. ""The way today we are able to do this is painfully old-school.""  Blockchain hybrid  Currently, LendingRobot is subject to an annual audit, during which the books are opened, and the auditor hired by the firm does their best to ensure that all the investments actually are where they’re supposed to be.  While customers themselves are able to view the status of individual investment notes at any time via the website or mobile app, they don’t have the accountant's access to detail.  By moving weekly updates to the ethereum blockchain, Marot believes LendingRobot has taken a step towards making both the official audit and the customer’s verification easier and more granular.  ""The good thing about putting it on the blockchain is that the auditing itself will be much simpler for them, so that’s cheaper for us,"" said Marot.  He added:  ""But we have to start with this ugly mix of human interaction and technology.""  A new kind of product  In addition to the blockchain interaction, LendingRobot today announced four new investing opportunities.  Collectively named the LendingRobot Series, the investment opportunities are a way for investors to split their resources between loans to consumers, small businesses and real-estate investors, diversified across the partner 'peer lending' platforms.  While the alternative lending platform is already part of a larger fintech movement that seeks to cut banks out of the equation by connecting lenders directly with borrowers, Marot envisions future investment products powered by a blockchain that might even remove him from the equation – for a fee, of course.  Should the day come when the execution phase of his investments ever moves to self-executing code on the ethereum blockchain or another blockchain capable of supporting smart contracts, Marot said he imagines tools with which counterparties could simply choose their preferred terms and truly connect directly.  Instead of being concerned about the potential that his company might one day be largely smart contract-driven, Marot expects potentially new investment opportunities to open up.  ""It would be faster for us, it would be faster to distribute, it would be safe, more transparent for everybody, and it will get to a point where even for originators it will be better. Even before issuing a listing, they will be able to know if there is investor appetite,"" Marot told CoinDesk, concluding:  ""That’s definitely the way we go.""

42379190,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nQrF,1485445241,Bitcoin is Abuzz With New Satoshi Nakamoto Rumors,"If the gossip at a recent invite-only bitcoin conference is any indication, news may be forthcoming in the long-simmering Satoshi Nakamoto saga.  On the sidelines of the two-day Satoshi Roundtable conference in Cancun, rumors were swirling that new developments in the 'Who is Satoshi?' story once again relate to the controversial Australian academic and entrepreneur Craig Wright, who last May claimed that he – and as many as four others – contributed to the white paper credited to bitcoin's pseudonymous inventor.  This time, however, there is said to be a potential twist to the story relating to an unknown entity that may have a claim to the intellectual property created by that group.  Major news outlets are once again said to be conducting an investigation into the story, with releases coming out as early as next month.  While interesting, the speculation is notable given that Wright's claims were later attacked by cryptographers, with even those who initially vouched on his behalf later attempting to distance themselves from their previous support.  Wright later publicly apologized for what he claimed is his inability to provide more proof defending his claims, stating at the time:  ""I believed that I could do this. I believed that I could put the years of anonymity and hiding behind me. But, as the events of this week unfolded and I prepared to publish the proof of access to the earliest keys, I broke. I do not have the courage. I cannot.""

42379181,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nQiR,1485442593,Bundesbank President: Blockchain is a 'Multi-Purpose Tool',"The head of Germany’s central bank described blockchain as “a multi-purpose tool” during a G20 summit speech earlier this week.  Leaders from the international organization are meeting in Germany this week to discuss issues around the digitization of finance. The event also saw Bank of England chief Mark Carney remark on distributed ledger tech, suggesting that the tech could “reshape” the financial sector.  While Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann largely steered clear of such statements, he did briefly note the central bank’s work with exchange operator Deutsche Börse on a blockchain-focused securities trade project, as well as internal research on the tech.  He told conference attendees:  ""Originally developed for the bitcoin virtual currency, this distributed ledger technology, it would appear, has turned out to be a multi-purpose tool. And even central banks – which aren't typically known for being early adopters of new technologies – are currently doing experimental research on the potential use of blockchain.""  Perhaps most notably, Weidmann went on to indicate support for an accommodative regulatory framework for FinTech startups as part of Germany’s presidency of the G20 group. In his speech, he said that an approach that avoids ""hindering financial innovation is warranted"".  While he didn’t offer any details as to what that framework might constitute, Weidmann indicated that any initial steps would include mapping out possible strategies for developing any FinTech-facing rules.  ""Our aim is to develop a set of common criteria for the regulatory treatment of FinTechs,"" he said.

42379186,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nQnT,1485440753,BitFury to Expand China Footprint Following $30 Million Deal,"A new two-part deal valued at $30m will see BitFury expand its footprint in China.  The full-service blockchain technology company has announced a deal with Credit China Fintech, a firm that provides consumer-facing financial products, according to FT. The $30m deal has two components: an investment in BitFury directly and plans to establish a joint venture in China.  In statements, Credit China Fintech said that it would seek to adopt the technology for its services, looking at applications of both the bitcoin blockchain and private ledgers.  Phang Yew Kiat, Vice-Chairman and CEO of Credit China Fintech, said in a statement:  “Blockchain is a fast emerging technology allowing effective secured value transfer over the internet. Our collaboration with BitFury will further cement our leadership position in the use of Blockchain technologies across our FinTech platforms, taking Credit China Fintech to a new level of competitiveness.”  The deal comes on the heels of the launch of a new international blockchain-focused group, dubbed the Global Business Blockchain Council, formally unveiled at the Davos conference in Switzerland earlier this month. Yesterday, the group announced its list of founding members, which includes representatives from BitFury, law firm Covington and the World Bank, among others.  In pushing to expand more significantly into China, BitFury enters the largest ecosystem for bitcoin miners – mining is a competitive, energy-intensive process by which new transactions are added to a blockchain – as well as traders.  “China is a visionary country and we are honored to have the opportunity to expand the work of our company to this significant part of the world,” BitFury founder and CEO Valery Vavilov said.

42399548,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjnNw,1485437307,SARB Chief: Blockchain Could Bring Financial Access to Millions of People,"“[T]his technology has the potential of bringing in millions of people who are currently excluded from economic activity.”  So says  Lesetja Kganyago, governor of the South African Reserve Bank (SARB), the country’s central bank. Speaking on the sidelines of the Davos conference in Switzerland with BizNews.com earlier this month, Kganyago remarked on the tech’s potential to improve conditions for financial inclusion.  The governor has expressed openness toward the technology in the past, remarking in August that the SARB was “willing to consider the merits” of blockchain. Meanwhile, banks in South Africa have tested the tech for months, a collaboration that has since grown to include the SARB itself, among other regulators.  In terms of potential use cases, Kganyago highlighted the tech’s possible use in enhancing government services, telling the publication:  “It has the potential of automating so many government processes and makes the delivery of services by governments super-efficient. People think that it’s in its early days, but it is already being used in so many different respects.”  In the interview, Kganyago also touched on the environment in which this work is being pursued within South Africa’s finance sector, describing it as a positive one.  “South Africa is very good at structuring national conversations and the conversations between the tax sector, the banking sector, and the regulators is actually a very useful conversation that is taking place,” he remarked.

42399561,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjnZk,1485432008,"Blocked By Block Size, Bitcoin's Brain Trust Goes Back to Basics","""That's the thing with bitcoin. You shouldn't be able to all come to Cancun and make a decision that changes the entire game.""  Faced with a stalemate on critical issues, day two of Satoshi Roundtable saw a notable decline in participation, as the number of attendees tapered off gradually at the 'unconference' famed for its invite-only status and secretive public presence.  Whereas day one featured well-attended sessions on a range of issues, day two saw relatively fewer guests attempt to both break new ground on some of the larger issues facing the $14.5bn network and regroup around its core values.  Faced with frustrations about the lack of diversity in participants (not present this year were many major miners and business executives), early conversation mostly served to galvanize users and technologists around common goals, such as how cryptography could be used to protect personal freedoms and remove power from governments and institutions.  Blockstream principal architect Christopher Allen framed the conversation as a return to basics, one that also united a notable number of visible industry participants in an environment that was perhaps more suitable to civil conversation.  Allen told CoinDesk:  ""I'm reluctant to use the word reconciliation or compromise, but I think there's an openness here. We didn't come up with any perfect answers, but we'd like to heal the rifts.""  Still, in the day's earlier sessions, older tensions seemed to flare as past debates resurfaced.  For example, there remains a division among the technology's supporters and entrepreneurs on how to evaluate the developments on ethereum, an alternative blockchain for smart contracts that experienced a controversial split last year.  Elsewhere, there remained an advocacy among developers for prioritizing ways to keep the core bitcoin software unchanged, despite pressures for more aggressive problem solving.  ""I think the philosophy of bitcoin people has been, bitcoin is much like the Internet. How many people would say the Internet hasn't innovated? When you look at the protocol, it hasn't innovated much at all. We do it in layers,"" another attendee said.  The discussions in some ways served to reinforce divides between businesses (drawn to ethereum's aggressive problem solving) and developers (who have shown a preference for approaches that emphasize conservatism and security).  Us vs them  In the face of technical disagreement, though, unity was often found in rhetoric that positioned bitcoin as a vehicle capable of checking potentially hostile world powers.  One executive of one of the industry's largest incumbent supporters, for example, gave a keynote address in which he talked at length about his discussions with other enterprise firms. ""You have people so nervous,"" he said.  There was also humor to be found in barbs aimed at some of the institutions that have gone so far as to announce trials and proofs-of-concept using the blockchain technology.  ""They have not internalized how much they have to change. You've shown up with a Ferrari and they're insisting on putting a lawnmower in it,"" he said.  Yet, there were also pleas for bitcoin's enthusiasts to commit to certain core values, an argument that was made under the assumption that pressures from outside influencers will only continue as the technology continues to grow.  One guest remarked:  ""If there is a war or another 9/11, there will be prominent people in this space, there will be serious people in this room who will turn.""  'Trimming the list'  This argument later saw additional color in a more technical session aimed at revisiting the value that each of bitcoin's features provides.  On the list, sketched out on a marker board, were topics including fraud management, transaction finality, opt-in transparency and permissionlessness.  Notable in the discussion was that attendees displayed a willingness to prioritize features that were perhaps less likely to be obvious to users, an assumption carried out under the premise that such design decisions are being made in the greater good.  ""I think the majority people wouldn't care if it ended up as all the bad things in one spot. Someone would find that worst case acceptable, because as long as you're playing by the rules, you're getting rich,"" one attendee argued.  The discussion went on to envision scenarios in which bitcoin could plausibly exist, but in ways that diminish the features those in attendance believe would make it more valuable.  Yet, the conversation often felt like a return to square one in the way it sought to envision how bitcoin might best be described in a way that incorporates new understanding of the science that supports its distributed digital transactions.  An attendee said:  ""We're not trying to redefine bitcoin, we're trying to discover the definition.""  Sidechains considered  That's not to say that the discussion didn't provide advances.  In conversation, prominent technologists seemed increasingly interested in testing scenarios in which a sidechain, or a blockchain featuring bitcoins pegged to the main blockchain, would be used as a way to extend the tech's functionality while preserving its core.  Under this scenario, the bitcoin blockchain could theoretically support a separate blockchain that would have different features, such as say, an 8MB block limit as proposed by those in the community who favor more aggressive scaling tactics.  The discussion focused on two particular sidechains proposals introduced in recent months, though which had not been broadly been considered as potential ways to achieve scaling.  However, there was acknowledgement that other factors needed to be refined (such as how the sidechains would be secured). Also notable is that the idea would require the addition of new code to the bitcoin protocol by way of a soft fork, meaning miners would still have to signal support for the upgrade.  Conceptually, however, the idea seemed to have support, and a potentially broad appeal.  One attendee summed up the idea:  ""The people who want things to stay the same can keep everything. For people who want large blocks, you don't have to schedule a hard fork.""

42399547,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjnMx,1485404420,China's Central Bank is Testing a Blockchain-Backed Digital Currency,"China's central bank has reportedly tested a blockchain-based digital currency.  According to a report by Caixin yesterday, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) completed a trial on 15th December in which it demoed how transactions and settlements might take place via a custom distributed ledger system.  The test was reportedly held in conjunction with major domestic commercial banks including Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), Bank of China and WeBank.  The report reads:  ""The bank suggested the digital currency would not only reduce circulation costs but also increase transparency and curb money laundering and tax evasion.""  Elsewhere, the report went so far as to suggest the pilot digital currency could be connected to the Shanghai Commercial Paper Exchange, forming a ""national platform for bank bill transactions"". In conjunction, the PBOC will also establish a digital currency research institute for which it is seeking experts in big data, cryptography and blockchain tech.  The reports follow statements from PBOC governor Zhou Xiaochuan in February, in which he hinted that the central was considering blockchain as one of a number of technologies that would enable it to issue a form of digital cash.  Further, the actions coincide with the PBOC's ongoing investigations into the country's major bitcoin exchanges, a process that began earlier this month and that has seen the startups enact a number of changes to trading policies.
