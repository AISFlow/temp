42413079,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7Mtm,1674861285,WazirX Says Binance Lied About Ownership as Dispute About India’s Largest Exchange Escalates,"Emails obtained by CoinDesk shed new light on the ongoing debate over the opaque and disputed ownership of WazirX, India’s largest crypto exchange.  In November 2019, the ownership of WazirX was uncontested: Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, published a blog post saying it had purchased the Indian exchange. WazirX’s executives talked openly about the acquisition.  But last summer, when WazirX landed in hot water with the Indian government, the story started to change. In early August, WazirX’s Mumbai office was raided by Indian officials on suspicions that the exchange had helped 16 fintech companies launder money.  Binance immediately took steps to publicly distance itself from WazirX. The Binance blog post that initially celebrated the acquisition was amended to say the transaction was instead “limited to an agreement to purchase certain assets and intellectual property.” On Aug. 5, Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao tweeted that “Binance does not own any equity in Zanmai Labs, the entity operating WazirX.” A spokesperson for Binance told CoinDesk that reports of Binance’s ownership of WazirX were “a lie.”  What followed was months of public back-and-forth between WazirX and Binance over the true ownership of the Indian exchange, during which Binance claimed the transaction never went through. WazirX officials said it did – and claimed they had proof, though they never shared it.  This week, CoinDesk got WazirX’s proof as the disagreement was privately coming to a head.  In the early hours of Jan. 26 – the day of a national holiday in India – Binance sent WazirX a letter requiring the Indian exchange to meet two demands by the end of this month or risk Binance terminating its service agreement with WazirX by Feb. 3.  First, Binance told WazirX to publish a pre-written “clarificatory statement” retracting WazirX co-founder Nischal Shetty’s previous statements that Binance owned WazirX. It also required WazirX to erase all mentions of Binance in its terms of service.  On Friday, Zanmai, WazirX’s official name, responded to Binance’s demands in a letter obtained by CoinDesk. It fought back, claiming the demand letter was “unethical” and attempted to use “media pressure and threats to force Zanmai into issuing false and misleading statements as ‘clarifications.’”  Refusing to retract  In the letter to Binance’s legal team and CEO, Shetty refused to retract his prior statements that Binance had purchased the Indian exchange.  “Zanmai has not made any false or misleading statements regarding Binance’s role and responsibility in operating the WazirX platform, and Binance’s control over WazirX’s user assets,” according to this week’s letter. “Zanmai transferred the control and ownership over the WazirX platform to Binance.”  Shetty also said in the letter that Binance had profited handsomely from its control of the exchange.  “Binance has unilaterally withdrawn significant amount of moneys (over USD 67 million) which has been earned as trading fees on the WazirX platform,” Shetty wrote in the email to Binance. “Binance transferred these amounts to an internal account solely controlled by it since Binance owned the WazirX wallets.”  To prove his point, Shetty attached a partially redacted email chain that began on July 19, 2021, between Brian Schroder, the CEO of Binance US, and Tushar Patel, the vice president of finance at WazirX, about an amended “share purchase agreement.”  The document, dated Jan. 13, 2020, grants Binance ownership of certain WazirX accounts (the identity of which are redacted in the version CoinDesk reviewed).  'Sole benefit of Binance'  According to the email chain, the terms of the agreement allowed WazirX to continue “access[ing] and operat[ing] these accounts for the sole benefit of Binance,” which was designated as “the absolute owner(s) of these accounts.”  On July 28, 2021, after Patel agreed to the purchase agreement, Schoder wrote: “Thank you, Tushar, we will start the transfer process and keep you updated.” CoinDesk didn’t see any followup messages, if there were any.  If WazirX doesn’t comply with Binance’s requests, Binance’s demand letter made clear that this will effectively sever their relationship.  Sources from both exchanges have said such an outcome would likely crush WazirX, which, according to the Indian exchange’s proof-of-reserves report published Jan. 11, stores 90% of user assets in Binance-controlled wallets.  “If you have funds on WazirX, you should transfer it to Binance. Simple as that,” CZ tweeted after the raid on WazirX in August.  “We could disable WazirX wallets on a tech level, but we can’t/won’t do that,” he added. “And as much as debates as we are enduring, we can’t/won’t hurt users.”  Danny Nelson contributed reporting to this story.

This has been a much-needed boost for the market during this time, but an unexpected investor group is reportedly driving the price of the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Surges Are Happening During U.S. Hours In a new Matrixport report that was shared with NewsBTC via email, U.S. institutional investors are driving the recent price increase of bitcoin. The report notes that over the course of January, the digital asset is already up over 40% but more than 35% of those increases have happened during U.S. trading hours. As such, the research report concludes that U.S. investors are driving the price. Related Reading: Money Leaves ADA, SOL To Small Cap Altcoins, Here’s Where It’s Headed Matrixport explains the reasoning behind this by saying that when an asset performs so well during U.S. hours, especially one that trades for 24 hours, it shows that institutional investors are buying the asset. However, when it does well during Asian hours, then it means that Asian retail investors are buying it. BTC moves the most during U.S. trading hours | Source: Matrixport The most significant movements have happened during this time and the trend lines show very strong similarity to Bitcoin’s movements to this point. But even more interesting is the fact that the data shows that U.S.-based investors are responsible for 85% of the total BTC buying that is happening currently. What Is Driving These U.S.-Based Investors? As the Matrixport report notes, U.S.-based investors have been encouraged by the inflation slow-down. It has put individual and institutional investors in positions where they believe they can take more risks. Hence, there is a marked increase in their exposure to risk assets such as bitcoin. BTC price rises over 40% in less than 30 days | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com Furthermore, the report points to the possibility of more rallies given the fact that inflation is expected to keep falling. “This could set up the crypto market for a mid-month rally, every month and turn into a trend where we see a strong rally from mid-month onwards with some consolidation towards the end of the month as traders take profit and miners sell calls.” Related Reading: Here’s What Might Have Triggered Ethereum’s Decline Below $1,600 This is also good news for altcoins as Matrixport notes that historically, money flowing into bitcoin will eventually spread out into other digital assets. So this could mean that the market has not seen the last of the altcoin rally once these institutional investors begin spreading out their investments. BTC is currently trading at $22,959 at the time of this writing. The coin is seeing small gains of 0.06% in the last 24 hours but on a seven-day rolling basis, the digital asset is still doing quite well with 9.45% gains.

Top Story  Four senior Biden administration officials published a statement on Friday urging Congress to “step up its efforts” with respect to regulating the cryptocurrency market.  The officials – Brian Deese, director of the National Economic Council; Arati Prabhakar, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy; Cecilia Rouse, chair of the Council of Economic Advisors; and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan – wrote that Congress “should expand regulators’ powers to prevent misuses of customers’ assets … and to mitigate conflicts of interest.”  Other suggestions for Congress in the statement included strengthening transparency and disclosure requirements for crypto companies, strengthening penalties for violations of illicit-finance rules and working more closely with international law enforcement partners.  The officials also made suggestions about what Congress should not do in terms of crafting new crypto regulation, including “greenlight[ing] mainstream institutions, like pension funds, to dive headlong into cryptocurrency markets.”  To do so, the officials warned, “would be a grave mistake” that “deepens ties between cryptocurrencies and the broader financial system.”  Token Roundup  Ether (ETH): ETH was up 0.2% to recently trade at $1,600.

Crypto Market Analysis: Bitcoin, Ether Trading Activity Lessens as Investors Await FOMC’s Next Interest Rate Hike  By Glenn Williams Jr.  Markets next week will be eyeing the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) interest rate decision, largely expected to be a 25 basis point (bps) increase  BTC’s correlation with the S&P 500 has waned slightly over the last week, declining to 0.69 from 0.89 on Jan 11. Its correlation with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite remains elevated at 0.89, underscoring the “bitcoin trades like a high-beta tech stock” narrative.  Meanwhile, bullish investors should be wary about the stablecoin supply ratio (SSR).  The SSR measures the ratio between the supplies of bitcoin and stablecoins. As stablecoins represent buying power, a reduction in the SSR implies that investors are sending stablecoins to exchanges, likely for the purpose of buying bitcoin. Since Jan. 11, the SSR has increased 32%. So while BTC’s price has risen, investors do not appear to be sending stablecoins to exchanges en masse to add to long positions.

The collection features a wide range of notable digital creators, including generative artist Matt Kane; All Seeing Seneca, the digital artist that helped create art for NFT collection Bored Ape Yacht Club; and founder of NFT collection Cyber Brokers Josie Bellini.  Each artist contributed one unique work, available in limited quantities, to the collection.  Earlier this month, Grails III opened its mint passes for collectors to purchase ahead of the artwork reveal. Once the digital art was unveiled, users purchased NFTs until the mint period closed Tuesday.  At the time of writing, the collection had done 199 ETH in sales, or about $318,300, and had a floor price of 2 ETH, or $3,200.  While Twitter users speculated on the mystery names behind the art, Proof says Grails isn't mean to just be about the artists and their historical bodies of work. Rather, the work is focused on allowing a collector to first engage with the artwork before diving deep into the artist's portfolio. Eli Scheinman, head of art at Proof, told CoinDesk that the purpose of the collection is to let the digital work speak for itself rather than by virtue of the creators behind it.  “In our space, and almost always for most collectors, engagement with a piece of art is tightly bundled with the name of the artist behind it and by extension, the value that's ascribed to that work,” said Scheinman. “Grails emanated from this place of trying to disrupt that in some respects and to focus the work and the engagement with that work on the piece from a collector perspective.”  Proof’s Grails III is the third iteration of its mystery NFT compilation series. In February 2022, Grails I dropped, with work from entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk, CryptoPunks and Meebits creator Larva Labs and generative artist Tyler Hobbs. The next edition, Grails II, was released in August and featured works from Art Blocks founder Erick Calderon, Pussy Riot co-founder Nadya Tolokonnikova and generative artist Refik Anadol.  Proof is a prolific player in the NFT space, landing itself on the map for its Moonbirds NFT collection, which raked in $200 million in sales upon its release in April.

42413057,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7N8k,1674854002,Bitcoin Holds Steady Above $23K as Traders Eye Fed’s Next Meeting,"Bitcoin (BTC) held above $23,000 on Friday as traders awaited next week’s Federal Open Market Committee decision on interest rates and any hints policymakers may drop about when their hiking campaign might end.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization recently changed hands at around $23,100, up 0.1% for the day.  It’s been a roaring start to 2023 for bitcoin, which has surged in price by more than 40% since New Year’s Eve. BTC surpassed $23,000 for the first time since mid-2022 about a week ago and has managed to stay in that territory.  “Bitcoin should still consolidate leading up to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decision, with risks to the downside if the Fed sticks to its hawkish mantra,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange Oanda, wrote in a Friday note about the Federal Reserve's rate-setting unit.  Traditional markets were also slightly up, with the S&P 500 Index up about 0.3%.  The crypto rally came after the latest Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report showed a slowdown in inflation at the end of last year – a goal the Fed has been aiming for with rate hikes. The CME FedWatch tool currently shows that traders see roughly a 99% chance the FOMC will raise rates by 25 basis points (0.25 percentage point) at its February meeting.  With the recent broader market rally, top crypto assets like bitcoin and ether (ETH) have topped equities this year: ETH is up about 32%, while the CoinDesk Market Index is up 39%. In comparison, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite index were up 6% and 10%, respectively.  Joel Kruger, markets strategist at crypto exchange LMAX Digital, said that from a technical standpoint the price of BTC is currently overbought, as seen by the daily relative strength index (RSI) that measures the magnitude of recent price changes.  According to data from TradingView, the RSI indicator showed a level of 81.9 on Friday. (Readings above 70 suggest an asset is overbought.)  Kruger told CoinDesk that BTC's next important resistance to watch comes in at around $25,200 based on its August peak. He wouldn't rule out “the possibility of seeing BTC go down $10,000 in the first half of the year” or seeing its rally “above $50,000 in the second half of the year.”  “There's a lot of room to go either way,” he said. “I'm just wondering if there's one more shoe to drop before we finally see that next big push.”  Data sourced from Coinglass shows the funding rates for BTC currently sit at around 0.01% as of Friday, a signal that market sentiment leans bullish among traders, but are “still far from the 0.06% levels recorded in February or November of 2021 when traders were paying 80% more annualized to long bitcoin,” according to Lucas Outumuro, head of research at crypto data and analysis firm IntoTheBlock, in a Friday newsletter.  Outumuro wrote that “the current levels in derivatives suggest the market is optimistic, but at the same time not yet overheated, which could create grounds for the ongoing rally to persist.”",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/27/bitcoin-holds-steady-above-23k-as-traders-eye-feds-next-meeting,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5ccbe33cc0bfdff74622b8c60d1605ebb9a78f6e-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421384,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnzZd,1674853059,Better Policy Can Turn NFTs Into an Intellectual Property Powerhouse,"Securities laws issues have often driven crypto policy, but when it comes to non-fungible tokens, we need to prioritize intellectual property interests. Treating all NFTs as financial assets will compromise the U.S.’ position as the gold standard of intellectual property (IP) protection and enforcement.  The immediate danger of this one-size-fits-all approach is that it will damage the commercial prospects of this emerging technology. NFTs are a medium for not only evolving the way we create, use and monetize IP, but also how artists and brands engage with their audiences. It is critical that policy efforts encourage and protect U.S. IP rights holders who are expanding their creative portfolios through NFTs.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s Policy Week. Diana Stern is general counsel at Palm NFT Studio.  IP is a critical part of the U.S. economy. According to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), industries that intensively use IP protection, which include manufacturers, broadcasters and independent artists, account for over 41% of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) and employ one-third of the total workforce. American IP is worth $6.6 trillion, more than the nominal GDP of any other country in the world, and accounts for 52% of all U.S. merchandise exports, per the Chamber of Commerce’s Global IP Center (GIPC).  An effective IP regime incentivizes creators and companies to generate new IP and capitalize on their rights in innovative ways. We are just starting to see how rights holders will do this by unlocking the potential of NFTs, which is part of the reason the USPTO requested information on this burgeoning industry last year.  In corporate America, NFTs are crossing the chasm from novelty research and development (R&D) initiatives, to meaningful digital marketing spend that outperforms traditional channels and even to entirely new ways to monetize IP portfolios. In 2022, Nike, Tiffany & Co. and other household names sold NFTs resulting in tens of millions of dollars in revenue, and in Nike’s case over $1 billion in sales volume.  NFTs are contributing directly to the bottom line and transforming how companies connect with their audiences. Where in the past fan fiction may have resulted in a cease-and-desist letter or even a lawsuit from the IP rightsholder, today the preeminent U.S. comic book publisher DC Comics worked with Palm NFT Studio to create one of the largest writers’ rooms by inviting holders of its NFTs to shape the story of future comics. Companies have activated entire communities of brand ambassadors overnight through NFT drops, and holders can remain engaged over time through experiences only made available to them.  Individual artists are also deepening their fan bases with engaging experiments. Digital illustrator Yam Karkai and her co-founders created the World of Women NFTs (WoW), a collection that celebrates art, representation, inclusivity and equal opportunities. WoW joined famed manager Guy Oseary’s star-studded clientele, inked a deal with Reese Witherspoon’s media company Hello Sunshine, and started a foundation dedicated to empowering women in Web3. U.S.-based artists Tyler Hobbs and Dandelion Wist Mané created QQL, a project that invites collectors to become co-creators by using the algorithm they designed to add an NFT to the collection. It successfully sold out to the tune of nearly $17 million in late 2022 when NFT sales had already cooled off, revealing potentially evergreen demand for innovative, IP-driven NFTs.  See also: NFTs and Intellectual Property: What Do You Actually Own?  Enforcing rights  Creators are already using copyright and trademark law to enforce their rights as they stake out their turf in the metaverse. For example, in Yuga Labs v. Ryder Ripps, a U.S. startup most recently valued at $4 billion, sued conceptual artist Ripps for trademark infringement when he made copies of their NFTs. In Nike v. StockX, Nike alleged that StockX infringed its trademarks when StockX made NFTs corresponding to physical shoes sold on its marketplace, which StockX argues is permitted under the first-sale doctrine.  On the other end of the spectrum, the Creative Commons license known as CC0, whereby the work is made available for unrestricted reuse, has gained popularity within the NFT world.  Not only is the U.S. IP rights regime supporting greater commercialization of IP portfolios through NFTs, but NFTs themselves can be part of the enforcement toolkit. Service of process has been given via NFT, and use cases for combating counterfeit and pirated goods are in the works.  However, I would not suggest leaning into NFTs and the smart contracts we use to transact them as traditional digital rights management (DRM) tools, like software that prevents you from copying a song and sending it to a friend. You can right-click to copy and paste an image associated with an NFT. That does not mean you can use the NFT to access all the experiences verified holders can engage with, or that it will retain any value whatsoever. Ripping the image from an NFT is like having a photocopy of signed memorabilia with no certificate of authenticity. From an IP perspective, it does not mean you are now the legal owner of the image. Depending on how the NFT is licensed, you may have infringed the rights of the creator.  Not all NFTs are like the IP-focused examples described here. Last year we saw the rise of financialized NFTs, including platforms where borrowers can use NFTs as collateral and projects offering high returns to “investors.” These may be subject to lending, securities and/or other financial regulations.  The current chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, has taken the position that most fungible tokens are securities. If the SEC and state securities regulators take a similarly sweeping view of the NFT market, it will chill the momentum of IP-driven NFTs. Regulatory constraints specific to securities would be imposed because of the technology these NFTs use, not because they are fit for purpose. Among other drawbacks, transferability of creative works would be severely limited and artists could inadvertently become investment companies.  Disincentives  Forcing all NFTs into a securities box will disincentivize enterprises and creators from taking advantage of new technologies and cut against the economic gains achieved by the U.S.’s IP regime. Economies with effective IP protection, like the U.S. today, are 70% more likely to produce more innovative output and nearly 40% more likely to attract venture capital and private equity, according to the GIPC.  Furthermore, securities laws are not the appropriate framework for addressing the main regulatory risk present for IP-centric NFTs: potential consumer harm. Similar to other nascent industries, scammers are waiting in the wings to take advantage of newcomers and buggy beta tools.  At the peak of inflated expectations for NFTs in 2021, many projects launched with grandiose claims and roadmap promises that went unfulfilled when the founders disappeared with purchasers’ funds – aka a “rug pull.” This should be stopped, and the U.S. Department of Justice demonstrated that it can – and will – effectively combat rug pulls when it brought criminal charges against the NFT projects known as Frosties and Mutant Ape Planet.  See also: Should You Copyright Your NFTs? | Opinion  There is also a strong system for consumer protection in the U.S. under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission and state Attorneys General. Many rights holders are already familiar with consumer protection laws applying to their products and services, and can adjust existing guidelines, controls and review processes for NFTs.  Rather than have the SEC lead the NFT space with a regulation by enforcement approach as it has with fungible tokens, the growth of NFTs should be guided by an IP-aware policy approach that addresses consumer harm while incentivizing artists, brands and fans to break open the possibilities offered by new technologies, ushering in the next wave of valuable IP.  Otherwise, we will see runaway production of NFTs before we’ve seen a fraction of what U.S. creators and IP rights holders can do with them.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Diana Stern,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/01/27/better-policy-can-turn-nfts-into-an-intellectual-property-powerhouse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8547d834e1a315ed81421f258263b8d3779e3fb3-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

BTC, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has risen 6.4% in value over the past seven days, while ETH, the second-largest crypto, has dropped 1.2%. Both cryptos had risen more than 30% earlier in January.  BTC continues to outperform ETH on the year, with the ETH/BTC ratio down 5% year to date.  The more muted price movement suggests that investors remain cautious about riskier assets amid often conflicting signs about economic growth and inflation, including this week’s unexpectedly small increase in gross domestic product (GDP) and decline in jobless claims.  Momentum of both digital assets has also declined, according to the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI). Bitcoin’s RSI remains above 70, implying that it still resides in overbought territory. ETH’s RSI by contrast has fallen to 60.  Bitcoin appears to have support, albeit tenuous, near $22,800, while ETH’s support resides near $1,570.  The top performers over the last seven days were MATIC and LEO, up 12% and 10.4% respectively. ETC and ETH were the laggards, with ETC up 0.9.%.  Bitcoin has maintained a strong correlation to copper futures, with a coefficient of 0.89. Given copper’s role as a measure of economic health, this trend implies that investors and other observers of crypto markets are heavily weighing macroeconomic analysis.  Markets next week will be eyeing the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) interest rate decision, largely expected to be a 25 basis point (bps) increase  BTC’s correlation with the S&P 500 has waned slightly over the last week, declining to 0.69 from 0.89 on Jan 11. Its correlation with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite remains elevated at 0.89, underscoring the “bitcoin trades like a high-beta tech stock” narrative.  Meanwhile, bullish investors should be wary about the stablecoin supply ratio (SSR).  The SSR measures the ratio between the supplies of bitcoin and stablecoins. As stablecoins represent buying power, a reduction in the SSR implies that investors are sending stablecoins to exchanges, likely for the purpose of buying bitcoin. Since Jan. 11, the SSR has increased 32%.

42394484,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bw8LEz,1674851322,What Is World Of Women? Everything to Know About the NFT Project Championing Diversity in Web3,"Project name: World of Women (WoW)  Project type: PFP (profile picture)  Original mint date: July 27, 2021  Original mint price: .07 ETH (approximately $150 at the time)  Runs on: Ethereum  Highest sale to date: WoW #9248, sold for 260 ETH (the equivalent of about $624,000 USD) on January 24, 2022.  What is World of Women?  World of Women, often abbreviated as WoW, is a global community built around the original collection of 10,000 non-fungible tokens (NFT) designed by artist Yam Karkai.  Considered by many to be a blue-chip collection, WoW has received support from prominent NFT influencers including Gary Vaynerchuck, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Aoki. The collection’s artwork features empowering depictions of diverse female avatars with 189 possible rarity traits including skin tones, hairstyles and accessories such as sunglasses, earrings and charm necklaces. The colorful art design celebrates WoW’s mission of diversity and promotes equal opportunity in Web3.  “We’re a community and brand that celebrates art, representation and inclusivity for all,” said WoW community manager Kashvi Parekh. “I see WoW as a Web3 legacy brand.”  The fandom surrounding WoW continues to grow, so much so that the team dropped a second collection of 22,222 NFTs, known as WoW Galaxy, in March 2022. The second collection is accompanied by an engaging new storyline that describes a cryptic message sent to the WoW Assembly of Women. The women crack the code and discover a new planet known as Nova Gaïa.  “I've spoken to a lot of people in this space and they describe us as the female version of CryptoPunks,” said Parekh. “We were one of the first ones to break into the mainstream with a legit project and mission behind us.”  Parekh describes the WoW community as a collective of “benevolent people” united by a shared mission to make tech and Web3 a more inclusive space. “I am constantly in awe of how kind the people in our community are, as well as how talented they are,” she said.  Where can I buy World of Women?  Primary NFT sales took place on the World of Women website. Today, original WoW and WoW Galaxy NFTs can be purchased on secondary marketplaces, including OpenSea, LooksRare and Rarible.  What is the project’s utility?  The WoW team considers holders to be both contributors to and stakeholders of the project’s mission, according to the official WoW website. Owning a WoW NFT gives holders ownership of both the underlying artwork and intellectual property (IP) of their NFT, along with perks like monthly derivative art airdrops from NFT artists within the WoW community, raffles, discounts and invitations to exclusive events. For instance, WoW holders were surprised with tickets to a holders-only Madonna concert during NFT NYC 2022, and at Art Basel 2022 in Miami, holders donned formal wear for the first annual WoW Gala.  The WoW team is also known for surprising holders with clues linked to gamified experiences across social media and IRL locations. These clues act like Easter eggs that unlock additional utility and perks. In July, original WoW holders each received a mysterious airdrop of digital blue “capacitors,” or electrical devices that store energy. WoW Galaxy holders also received an airdrop of green capacitors. Recipients could then redeem these capacitors for a virtual home in the WoWverse metaverse world.  Offshoot projects  There’s been a lot of buzz about WoW’s high-profile partnerships, collaborations and special projects. Most recently, WoW partnered with crypto hardware wallet company Ledger on a collaborative device. WoW holders who successfully completed a gamified quest and claimed the proof of knowledge NFT had the chance to win a custom WoW or WoW Galaxy Ledger Nano X.  There have also been whispers of special licensing deals, though the WoW team has remained contractually tight-lipped: In February 2022, actress Reese Witherspoon’s production company Hello Sunshine announced it would build out the World of Women character universe and franchise into animated entertainment properties, including educational initiatives, films and TV series.  Shortly thereafter, in July, WoW announced a partnership with global toy brand Hasbro to release a limited-edition World of Women Monopoly board game. WoW’s co-founder and creative director, Karkai, will oversee the artwork for the Monopoly board. Both WoW and WoW Galaxy holders will have exclusive access to receive a physical board game.  “An announcement about Monopoly is coming [in Q1 of 2023],” Parekh told CoinDesk.  What do we know about the World of Women team?  World of Women was founded by artist and creative director Yam Karkai, her partner and WoW head of partnerships Raphaël Malavielle and their two pseudonymous friends, BBA and Toomaie. Prior to founding WoW, Karkai worked as a freelance digital artist while Malavielle, BBA and Toomaie all worked for tech startups. Conceptually and artistically, WoW is the brainchild of Karkai’s creative vision, while the company, brand and community have all thrived by the talents of Karkai, the project’s co-founders and its growing team of more than 20 employees and contributors.  What intellectual property (IP) rights do holders have?  Initially, holders only received commercial rights to their WoW, but the team has since updated their agreements to transfer all rights, including those to both the artwork and IP. WoW holders may use their NFT artwork in any way they want, including commercially, with some exceptions for hate speech and violence. (Note: Holders cannot use the project names “World of Women” or “WoW” for commercial reasons – only the artwork itself.) IP ownership is transferred when the NFT is sold or changed wallets, so holders with long-term business plans should protect their NFT by transferring it to cold storage where it is less susceptible to hacks.  WoW holders have been taking advantage of IP ownership in a variety of fun ways, including licensing it for products like tea, coffee, green juice, candles and more.  Check out these BizWoW projects — including WoW merch by actress Eva Longoria.  World of Women's future plans  World of Women has put a special focus on philanthropy and giving back. The community has supported at least 18 charities and causes in its first year.

DXP’s price gained some 50% in the past 24 hours and its price more than doubled since trading below $1 on Wednesday morning, according to cryptocurrency price tracker CoinGecko.  Vela Exchange was originally known as Dexpools on Ethereum before moving development to Arbitrum, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain. The platform allows for spot and perpetual futures trading, as well as peer-to-peer over-the-counter (OTC) trading where traders can avoid slippage and frontrunning.  The platform’s beta version opens for registered testers with early access on Jan. 31, and will be available for the broader public starting Feb. 7, according to the project’s website.  Vela’s token also garnered attention for listing the rebranded, identical utility token VELA on Camelot, another DEX on Arbitrum, on Thursday, potentially contributing to the rally. DXP holders on Ethereum and Metis can exchange their tokens one-to-one to VELA on Arbitrum without any fees using a bridge.  DXP or VELA investors can earn a share of the trading fees generated on the platform. At press time, DXP and VELA were both changing hands at $2.19.  Traders are betting on Vela taking a share of Arbitrum’s growing DEX activity and potentially mounting a challenge to the dominance of derivatives exchange GMX. Perpetual-focused GMX emerged as a leader in the sector last fall surpassing DEX giant UniSwap in daily trading fee earnings at one point. Gains Network, a DEX initially launched on Polygon and then expanded to Arbitrum, generated over $1.5 billion trading volume on Arbitrum after nearly a month of being deployed, CoinDesk reported.

42421388,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnzen,1674847809,The Best Tool for Designing Effective DeFi Policies Is Web3 Itself,"Most of the conversation about policy in Web3 has centered around what crypto pioneer Nick Szabo calls “wet code” – in this case, the laws that govern human institutions. The world of crypto offers an alternative – “dry code,” or computer code – to protect investors and users, which may be a more efficient approach by literally encoding rules in verifiable, permissionless and self-custodial protocols.  It is an approach that relies on incentives and the transparency of the technology itself.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s Policy Week. Matthew Niemerg is co-founder of Aleph Zero.  Why regulations matter  Let’s take a step back and consider the stated reason for financial regulation. Regulations are important because they can promote orderly and efficient markets and protect investors from those who may take advantage of them.  Take the problem of leverage, i.e., when people trade on margin, or borrowing money they have to pay back. Without going into detail, the math behind leverage is such that gains and losses increase linearly while risk increases quadratically. In other words, if you have 5x leverage you only gain or lose 5x against a given price movement, but your risk of being liquidated increases by 25x. Leverage, by its nature via math, sets the house up to win.  Couple this with the fact that exchange operators act as central clearing houses performing the settlement of trades. Historically, large institutions have filled this role, being willing to take the other side of a trade and eat the losses in the case a trader defaults.  To catch up: You have investors with access to leverage taking risks that increase quadratically, and centralized exchanges settling the results of their bets. Exchanges also have access to information regarding liquidation prices that the rest of the market does not have, and an incentive to manipulate the market for their own gain. You can see why regulators are interested in this arrangement and are needed to prevent exchanges from trading against their customers.  See also: DeFi's Difficult Governance Decisions Lie Ahead | Opinion  Regulations have a defined role and clear mandate to oversee centralized entities that, for the most part, can operate opaquely as far as clients having access to their inner workings.  DeFi is fundamentally different  With decentralized finance (DeFi), you have a completely different paradigm. Not only is there transparency, there is also no need for a centralized entity that controls the order flow of transactions. Funds are self-custodied. DeFi requires an entirely different approach to regulation because – while investor risks still exist – the responsibilities are entirely different, and so are the tools to mitigate risks.  Smart contracts make it simpler to aggregate financial interactions that would otherwise happen in fragmented, siloed and functionally private peer-to-peer (P2P) markets. In DeFi, smart contracts can play the role of an aggregator that was previously exclusive to operators of centralized exchanges.  For instance, an automated market maker protocol algorithmically determines the quote price of various assets and allows anyone to automatically offer these set prices to the rest of the market. Smart contracts then aggregate all the liquidity of the bids and asks together in an aggregated pool by using basic accounting. Similarly, money market protocols aggregate automate peer-to-peer (P2P) secured loans.  However, P2P trading or even private lending are not normally regulated activities, (cold hard cash is a peer-to-peer technology). Why should smart contracts be regulated if the activities they’re replicating are not? That’s putting aside the possibility that crypto can provide people with access to more efficient and transparent financial markets, without the risks inherent to centralized finance.  Code is law  In DeFi, we can use code to automate processes and track accounting data that can be used to drastically improve how these systems operate and manage risks. We can even design tools that protect users from unwanted risks. The idea that “code is law” becomes central. Of course, existing laws already prohibit fraudulent behavior if controllers of smart contracts operate unscrupulously.  The mechanisms that can protect DeFi investors from bad actors are likely to look more like analytics platforms, protective freeware and approval by reputable institutions that users are incentivized to use and seek for. Similar ideas have already been proposed by the European Commission that acknowledged the difficulties in regulating DeFi.  See also: DeFi Is the Way Forward, but It Needs to Evolve | Opinion  Regulators need to consider how technology and science can be used to achieve a desired policy. Perhaps the right step to take in terms of DeFi and Web3 regulation more generally is to focus on the ways in which the technology itself can be leveraged to safeguard investors and drive efficient markets.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Matthew Niemerg,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/01/27/defi-web-3-regulation-policy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9c1c63d0bf6e86e1957b720f1db1b48c67923676-2400x1605.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42421397,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnzn3,1674847765,Why Real Regulatory Change In Crypto Has Not Happened,"For years now, the compliance community has been consistently warned that a deluge of new regulation for all things crypto, which would see the industry forever changed, is coming. We are still waiting for even the slightest of rains.  The only potentially well-informed (although imperfect) legislative efforts on the horizon – Europe’s landmark crypto legislation, MiCA – has been held up for a second time, apparently to allow more time for translation.  Steven Eisenhauer is the chief risk and compliance officer at Ramp. This article is part of CoinDesk’s Policy Week.  Instead, what we’re seeing is redundant legislation being proposed to solve a problem that has been misdiagnosed for political expediency. This reflects poorly on the depth of knowledge that our regulators have on Web3 technology as a whole, and how competent they actually are in protecting consumers.  Sometimes new technologies require new approaches to regulations. Let’s consider what's wrong with the current approach, try to identify the real issues, and propose solutions to forge a new way forward.  Superfluous statutes  Take for instance the so-called Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act introduced by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D–MA) and Roger Marshall (R–KS) in December of the previous year.  The proposed legislation was presented at a Senate Banking Committee titled “Crypto Crash: Why the FTX Bubble Burst and the Harm to Consumers.” It would do little to protect consumers and would have done nothing to prevent what happened at FTX – as the almost singular focus of crypto-related regulations to date, a robust set of anti-money laundering (AML) rules have been widely applicable to crypto firms since before Sam Bankman-Fried even founded FTX.  As evidence of the effectiveness and application, we need only consider the settlement between Coinbase and the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), which is only the latest example in a long list of regulatory actions taken against crypto firms related to anti-money laundering and sanctions failures.  See also: Coinbase Will Pay $50M Fine to New York Regulator to Settle Background Check Charges  Warren’s involvement in this bill and the wholesale mischaracterization of its impact is particularly surprising, given her strong consumer protection bona fides (Warren is alternatively vilified and praised, depending on one’s political standing, for her leading role in the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau).  To many in crypto, this is nothing more than a direct attack on the entire space.  More likely, what we are seeing is all too common in politics: uninformed and desperate attempts to appear to be doing something – anything – in the aftermath of a disaster. Presenting more anti-money laundering legislation is easy and politically safe.  Overlooking the real issues  To be clear, there are gaping holes in the global regulatory frameworks for digital assets.  Most countries lack robust financial regulation applicable to crypto firms in the areas of consumer protection, safeguarding of customers' funds, capital and liquidity requirements, concentration risk management and disclosure requirements.  The need to address these regulatory gaps is widely acknowledged and quite urgent. The problem seems to be an unwillingness of some legislatures to educate themselves – a surprising statement in the wake of FTX!  See also: After FTX: How Congress Is Gearing Up to Regulate Crypto  This is all akin to a doctor that is unable to diagnose a patient’s ailment, yet opts to prescribe antibiotics so that they are seen to be treating the patient. Not only is it dangerous for the patient, who may forgo further tests in the false hope they will be cured, but it also contributes to global antibiotic resistance.  Prioritizing redundant legislation is similarly insidious, as it gives consumers a false sense of protection and further erodes confidence in global financial systems.  The way forward  If global legislatures are feeling overwhelmed by the body of knowledge required to effectively regulate crypto, they should take a methodical approach and rely on archetypes of successful financial regulation.  I recommend looking to the EU’s Payment Services Directive and its revisions for inspiration.  Instead of fiddling about trying to determine the different types of market participants to which the resulting regulation could apply, the law should describe and create regulations for each of the activities in which they are engaged.  The first step of the process needs to be to create a complete taxonomy of applicable products and services.  See also: The World's Best Crypto Policies: How They Do It in 37 Nations  Stepping through each defined product and service to determine appropriate rules will require politicians to educate themselves on the intricacies of blockchain technology and the varied services available to consumers - a net positive from the start.  For example, any effective prudential regulation for crypto would need to differentiate between custodial and non-custodial services.  Safeguarding requirements should apply to services involving the holding of a consumer’s assets but would be hilariously ineffective and irrelevant for self-custodied assets. Disclosure and transparency requirements could apply broadly, but need to ensure informative and specific information is provided to consumers.  There is no doubt that all of this requires a modicum of effort from legislators to educate themselves. Of course, it is far easier to attempt to push through yet another anti-money laundering bill.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Steven Eisenhauer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/01/27/reforming-cryptocurrency-regulation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fa21ca0c1083596c9f6ee81afc9b7e414ea84715-5062x3031.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In the past, “you couldn’t really take them [NFTs] across different protocols [and] platforms,” he said.  Earlier this week, Aptos’ token, APT, surged to an all-time high, reaching a peak of $16.46, according to CoinDesk data. The token gained 350% in value since the start of the year.  According to Shaikh, Aptos is primarily banking on its established and incoming users and developers to drive the platform’s success. That’s despite pushback from those who worried that Aptos’ APT token distribution veered in favor of the platform’s investors and its foundation, which received nearly half of the 1 billion tokens issued during the October mainnet launch.  “We really pushed the boundaries of what we think an egalitarian distribution should look like,” Shaikh said, referring to Aptos’ tokenomics. “For folks like investors, we have among the lowest distribution for any investor across any protocol at launch,” he said.  NFTs, a crypto asset that gives holders the ability to prove ownership of a digital item, should have “an opportunity to live in things like games [and] social platforms,” Shaikh said.  Pushing the boundaries of NFT use cases can also connect communities across the world, according to Shaikh. In 2023, he said, he expects NFTs to expand into the mainstream via big brands and as a form of payment.  “You can now exchange economic value, you can connect with creators and you can be empowered to do it in a way that not one entity controls that,” Shaikh said.

8339212,https://newsbtc.com/?p=517790,1674843416,"Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Reach Highest Value Since FTX Crash, Bullish?","On-chain data shows Bitcoin exchanges have registered the most significant outflows since the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX back in November. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Turn Greedy For First Time Since March 2022 Bitcoin Exchange Netflow Shows Deep Negative Values As an analyst in a CryptoQuant post pointed out, around 7,000 coins have left the exchange in this latest spike. The relevant indicator here is the “all exchanges netflow,” which measures the net amount of Bitcoin exiting or entering into the wallets of all centralized exchanges. The metric’s value is calculated by taking the difference between the inflows (the coins going in) and the outflows (the coins moving out). When the indicator has a positive value, the inflows overwhelm the outflows, and a net number of coins are deposited to exchanges. As one of the main reasons investors deposit to exchanges is for selling purposes, this trend can have bearish implications for the price of the crypto. On the other hand, negative values imply that a net amount of supply is currently being pulled off these platforms. Generally, holders withdraw their coins from exchanges to hold onto them for extended periods in personal wallets. Thus, such metric values can signal that investors are accumulating at the moment, which may have a bullish impact on the price. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin all exchange’s netflow over the last few months: Looks like the value of the metric has been quite negative recently | Source: CryptoQuant As shown in the above graph, the Bitcoin exchange netflow recorded a deep negative spike during the past day. This outflow amounted to around 7,000 BTC, leaving the wallets of these platforms the largest value the metric has seen since the FTX crash back in November of last year. From the chart, it’s apparent that the aftermath of FTX’s collapse saw some substantial outflow values. The reason behind that is that a known exchange like FTX going belly up instilled fear among investors and made them more aware of the risks of keeping their coins in centralized platforms. Naturally, these holders fled exchanges in masses (causing the netflow to plunge into red values) so that they could store their Bitcoin in offsite wallets, the keys they own. Interestingly, the latest negative netflow spike was recorded while Bitcoin has been observing a sharp rally. Usually, inflows are more commonly seen in periods like now, as investors rush to take some profits. Related Reading: CryptoQuant’s Bitcoin PnL Index Forms Bullish Crossover Thus, instead of making these large outflows, investors are showing signs that they are bullish on Bitcoin in the long term and feel that the current rally has more to offer still. That would be only if these investors made the withdrawals with accumulation in mind. In the scenario that they transferred out these coins for selling through over-the-counter (OTC) deals instead, Bitcoin could instead feel a bearish impulse.

The decision comes nearly 18 months after Custodia (formerly known as Avanti Bank) first filed its application for membership in the Federal Reserve System.  “Custodia is surprised and disappointed by the Board’s action today,” Caitlin Long, Custodia’s CEO, said in a press statement. “The Fed advised Custodia 72 hours ago that it could either withdraw its membership application or see it denied, and the Fed denied it in record time.”  “Custodia offered a safe, federally regulated, solvent alternative to the reckless speculators and grifters of crypto that penetrated the U.S. banking system with disastrous results for some banks,” Long continued. “Custodia actively sought federal regulation, going above and beyond all requirements that apply to traditional banks.”  The Wyoming-based bank’s application for a master account – which gives an institution direct access to the Federal Reserve’s payment systems and thus the ability to settle transactions with other lenders via central bank reserves – is still pending. It was initially filed in October 2020.

42421390,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnzht,1674838800,Tech’s Money Woes: Beginning of the End for Web2?,"After two decades of dominating and reshaping our lives, “Big Tech” is finally looking weakened.  According to Crunchbase, more than 46,000 staffers at U.S.-based tech companies lost their jobs in the first three weeks of 2023 alone, following a layoff tally of 107,000 in 2022. This week, Microsoft gave a gloomy forecast of 2023 enterprise demand for its Azure cloud services, which coincidentally suffered a major outage at the same time, while the Department of Justice (DOJ) served Google with a lawsuit that could end its monopolistic advertising operation. Add to that the chaos at Twitter since Tesla owner Elon Musk took over and Meta’s dismal stock performance as its earnings plunged in 2022, and we find broad-based malaise across the industry that brought us Web2.  The question is whether this is just a cyclical phenomenon or whether it’s a secular shift, the end of an era for the titans of Web2. And if it’s the latter, what comes next?  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Those who want to see a Web3 economy in which centralized internet platforms have less influence over our lives and where people and businesses have greater control over their data and content are naturally hopeful Big Tech’s woes are the precursor to a brighter future. But it could just as well be that this moment of distress passes and we either return to the status quo or a new architecture arises around artificial intelligence (AI) and metaverse technologies that’s overrun by the very same centralized firms dominant today.  Cyclical or secular?  The cyclical case is easy to make: The lax monetary environment before 2022 drove these firms to invest massively in new, pre-mainstream technologies such as AI and virtual reality. Now, as rising interest rates force their clients to reduce spending on these companies' cash-cow product offerings, such as online advertising and data storage, they’re forced to curb their outlays.  Seen that way, this is just a downsizing exercise, one that will put Big Tech in a healthier position to capitalize on the advance of the new technologies once they gain mainstream application.  But it’s noteworthy that cyclical financial weakness coincides with declining public trust in the tech industry, a trend that could portend a more lasting, secular decline in its prospects. After all, public opinion drives political response and, arguably, Big Tech’s greatest vulnerability lies in Washington, D.C.  In April, the annual Edelman Trust Barometer showed that in aggregate, trust in technology industries remains higher than others worldwide (including lowly thought-of media businesses, sadly.) But the key takeaway was that in the U.S., whose policy making apparatus has the greatest power to determine the industry’s fortunes, trust in tech hit an all-time low.  This isn’t surprising, given the negative news flow these past few years. People now have a clear window into Twitter’s intractable problems around hate speech moderation, bots, disinformation and the debate over identity and reputation – all unresolved, if not elevated, by Musk’s leadership. They’ve also had the curtain pulled back on Meta (formerly Facebook), whose well-documented abuses of people’s data inspired a rare case of bipartisan agreement in Congress.  Read more: The End of Crypto Twitter as We Know It?  Waning confidence has coincided with an escalation of regulatory action against the internet platforms, first in Europe, now in the U.S., with this week’s lawsuit against Google potentially the biggest threat of all to the Web2 titans’ economic model.  The antitrust suit, which accuses Google of having “corrupted legitimate competition in the ad tech industry,” could directly upend the central mechanism by which these firms turn their near-omniscient view of a billion-plus users’ data into dollars. For all the mounting criticism of this “surveillance capitalism” model, the platforms entrenched it, even deepened it, because it routinely delivered profits to shareholders. End all that and the ad- and data-driven Web2 economic system is itself put into question.  Frying pan to fire?  OK. But if this is the beginning of the end for Web2, what comes next?  Well, by definition, the future is Web3. But that says nothing other than to offer a word to describe the unknown world after Web2. Who is in control of that future system, that’s the question.  The idea that we will all be in control, because we generate the all-important data and the content that drives the internet economy, is appealing. I certainly support all efforts to achieve that, be they based on blockchains and non-fungible tokens (NFT) or something else. But there’s no guarantee such a utopia will arise.  In fact, without deliberate efforts by all stakeholders to establish fair frameworks around decentralized identity, credentialing, encryption and data storage, the “platform-less” Web3 world may still be controlled by giant data-hogging entities. And it could even be the same ones.  Consider AI, whose importance to the future digital economy is underscored by the recent advance of ChatGPT. As I wrote in December, many see this technology ending internet search as we know it. In a ChatGPT world, the idea goes, we’ll no longer ask a search engine to provide a list of websites with information related to what we’re interested in; we’ll simply query an AI chatbot and the answers will come back as text or audio. No need for Google, right?  Read more: ChatGPT Will Kill Search and Open a Path to Web3  Well, maybe we’ll no longer use Google search, but what about Google AI? The company’s parent, Alphabet, is investing enormous sums to develop AI systems – it was referenced multiple times in CEO Sundar Pichai’s note to staff when he announced 12,000 layoffs last week.  Maybe the victor won’t be Google but Microsoft, in partnership with the Elon Musk-founded OpenAI. The Seattle-based software provider just invested $10 billion in the company that developed the ChatGPT technology, on top of the $3 billion it had already dedicated to the partnership.  Or maybe these corporations lose and we end up with a nominally decentralized entity dominating everything, such as Ethereum, the leading platform for NFTs and decentralized finance. Do we want that?  At CoinDesk’s I.D.E.A.S. conference last fall, Osmosis Labs co-founder Sunny Aggarwal talked of Ethereum as an “empire” that wants developers of software and new ideas to abide by its standards and rules. Independent app-specific chains, linked together by the Cosmos protocol on which Osmosis builds, he said, is the way to a truly democratic, open internet.  Watch: Osmosis Labs' Sunny Aggarwal: Why Appchains Are the Future of DeFi  Whether the Cosmos vision to interoperability is the solution, or Polkadot founder Gavin Wood’s, or whether the answer lies in the Decentralized Social Network Protocol (DSNP) underpinning entrepreneur Frank McCourt’s Project Liberty mission to fix the internet is perhaps less important than the fact that the shape of that future internet is up to us.  If we want a decentralized internet and don’t want our lives manipulated by AI and by data-mining, centrally controlled public and private entities, we’re going to have to band together and insist on it. We need laws, standards bodies and multi-stakeholder governance systems in place. There’s a lot at stake.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | DOT | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Michael J.

42421394,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnzgr,1674837293,"Banks Will Dominate Stablecoins, and 2 Other Predictions About the Future of Money","As blockchain technology continues to develop over the coming years, cross-border payments will prove to be a game-changing use case. In order to grow, the industry needs user adoption while users will embrace a technology that fills an actual need. In many respects, stablecoins are the most useful innovation to come from crypto to date.  The company that finally builds a Web3 based application with a Web2 user experience will win. In the realm of payments that means being able to harness the benefits of crypto (high-speed, low-cost transactions) while meeting all the stringent regulatory demands the United States and Europe has over money-transmitting businesses.  Chris Hayes is a senior government relations executive focused on financial regulation and Chris Ostrowski is chief executive officer and a founder of SODA. This article is part of CoinDesk’s “Policy Week.”  Increasingly, in these jurisdictions it looks like the players set to capitalize most in this arena are regulated financial institutions – i.e., banks. Rather than “blowing up the traditional financial system” crypto is making the traditional financial system significantly more efficient.  This has happened before: At the dawn of the first wave of digital disruption fintechs were predicted to “eat up” and replace existing institutions. Instead, the banks integrated the software that supposedly threatened them either by acquisition or osmosis.  Based on the trends we’ve seen through engagement with central bankers and policymakers on the landscape for stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDC) in Europe and in the U.S. we make the following three predictions:  1. Fiat-backed stablecoins will continue to dominate developed markets, and therefore the remittance market, while other stablecoin designs drop by the wayside.  Private stablecoins exist currently in two types – fiat-backed stablecoins, which are on-chain tokens backed by off-chain cash or cash equivalents in a bank account, and nonfiat-backed stablecoins, which are either pure algorithmic stablecoins with no backing reserve or other designs backed by various levels of on-chain collateral. Both stablecoin types remain outside of regulation, except nascent policy regimes coming into force in the European Union and U.K.  Algorithmic stablecoins use self-regulating mechanisms to keep their private stablecoins pegged to another currency, a system that has had a rocky history. Typically, on-chain collateral consists of cryptocurrencies like BTC or ETH, fiat-backed stablecoins like USDC or USDT and a few nascent traditional financial assets brought on-chain (for example, there is a tokenized money market fund on Stellar, a tokenized green bond on Ethereum and some other efforts to tokenize traditional financial assets).  The collapse of Terra's terraUSD, a “pure” algorithmic stablecoin, has had a significant impact on the global stablecoin market. First, and perhaps most importantly, it has likely doomed any other type of algorithmic stablecoin from establishing a similar amount of trust.  Terra’s highly publicized failure has not only stirred intense political backlash against stablecoins generally but served as an example of how these self-stabilizing mechanisms can be knocked off-kilter. (This was a lesson about functionality we didn't learn from Titan/Iron, which failed before Terra.)  Second, algorithmic stablecoins that are nonfiat-backed, but also not “pure” algorithm based, face significant political and regulatory challenges. These designs, as currently structured, fall short of meeting the current liquidity expectations of prudential regulators in the EU and United States.  Third, fiat-backed stablecoins feel familiar to prudential regulators. They seem relatively simple to understand and, unlike collateralized designs with on-chain assets, present a more conventional risk profile. While fiat-backed stablecoins may have their own risks around lack of transparency behind their collateral holdings, prudential regulators can address those through regulation and enforcement.  As a result, the emerging stablecoin regulatory frameworks in the U.S. and Europe have already or will likely in the future make it very difficult for nonfiat stablecoins to exist or be utilized for payments. This will render them much less useful for payment applications, including remittances, which generally flow from developed countries to developing countries.  As we’ve seen, the new Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation in the EU makes it impossible for a nonfiat-backed stablecoin to be marketed as being pegged to the euro, without it holding auditable significant reserves in off-chain bank accounts. While there are ways to navigate around these regulations, it makes it harder to compete with those players that can operate within the regulatory framework and provide the expected safety for users.  See also: What's the Point of Stablecoins? Understanding Why They Exist | Opinion  Similarly, a proposed stablecoin bill in the U.S., which was discussed last year by then-House Financial Services Committee Chair Maxine Waters (D–Calif.) and then ranking Republican Patrick McHenry (R–N.C.), would impose a moratorium on all new nonfiat-backed stablecoin releases in the United States until the release of a report from the U.S. Treasury Department, hobbling any new stablecoin entrants. Moreover, it’s likely the Treasury would recommend restricting stablecoin use after its evaluation and report concludes.  These regulatory frameworks make it clear the direction developed markets are headed and how prudential regulators view stablecoins.  2. Retail CBDCs are viewed cautiously in the US and Europe, while wholesale CBDCs continue to grow.  China’s determined pursuit of the central bank digital currency colloquially known as the digital yuan is a cause for concern for central bankers and policymakers in Europe and the U.S. While it’s difficult to assess the effectiveness or usage of China’s CBDC, its very existence represents an unknown challenge to the established monetary order.  Other countries, including the Bahamas, Nigeria and Jamaica, have followed suit in launching a retail CBDC and have found adoption to be the biggest barrier to usage. In other words, promises of financial inclusion and digitalizing the economy are yet to be made good, as not enough citizens have used the CBDC.  Future retail CBDC pilots and launches will focus more on use cases that are unique to this particular form of tokenized public digital money. Without clear benefits, citizens will continue to use cash, commercial bank money or e-money in both more developed and less developed economies.  Public policy discussions around CBDCs will continue to be dominated by politically charged issues such as privacy, anonymity, cyber-security and government control. Less publicly, many central bankers will continue to explore how they can future proof their currencies from the threats of the e-yuan, cryptocurrencies and Big Tech actors moving into the payments space with their own tokens.  A combination of use-case testing, cross-border settlement and smart contract-enabled payment innovations will become public in 2023 as this work continues. The political environment makes it very unlikely that traditional banks would be willing to become virtual wallet providers for the central bank, which presents a political obstacle to adoption of retail CBDCs in the U.S. and Europe.  Wholesale CBDCs hold significant promise and offer blockchain enabled atomic settlement between central banks and financial institutions in any given country. There is much hope that 2023 will finally see a wholesale CBDC solution for cross border payments, perhaps spearheaded by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), though there have been false dawns before.  A globalized wholesale CBDC regime spanning Europe, the U.S. and Asia could revolutionize the banking sector and provide an innovative role for private stablecoins backed by traditional banking institutions as long as there is international coordination on regulation.  3. Traditional banks will dominate the stablecoin market once there is regulatory certainty in developed markets.  With increasing regulatory pressure towards fiat-backed stablecoins, the potential development of a wholesale CBDC in the U.S. and Europe, as well as a consumer flight to safety in the crypto market, the market is ripe for traditional banks to dominate the stablecoin market. Once regulatory certainty is achieved, traditional banking institutions will be well set up to enter the stablecoin space.  Traditional financial institutions have a leg up considering their existing compliance and legal functions, and may even have support from the banking regulators in pursuing stablecoin businesses. Plus, with their retail customer accounts, banks have a built in category of users for stablecoins.  Because of the regulatory moat and existing infrastructure, banks’ stablecoin efforts would have lower funding and customer acquisition costs compared to newer players such as USDC-issuer Circle. And they have every incentive to drive more revenue to themselves with payments conducted on blockchain, rather than through established payment networks like Visa and Mastercard.  While the EU finalizes the MiCA regulation and works on the digital euro, we’ll start to see European banks enter the forefront in entering the stablecoin space in the EU. There’s already been significant involvement in blockchain from players including BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank and Societe Generale.  In the U.S., a policy priority for the Biden Administration and Rep. McHenry, now the chair of the House Financial Services Committee, is to find a path forward on stablecoin regulation, given its direct impact on the traditional financial system.  See also: The Niche Application of Stablecoins Is Not a Bad Thing | Opinion  The battle continues on whether only traditional banking institutions will be able to issue stablecoins, and that, along with the tight political margins in the House of Representatives, makes it unclear if legislation can move forward in the next two years.

42413051,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7N5w,1674837275,White House Calls on Congress to ‘Step Up Its Efforts’ on Crypto Regulation,"Four senior U.S. officials in the Biden administration published a statement on Friday urging Congress to “step up its efforts” with respect to regulating the cryptocurrency market.  The officials – Brian Deese, director of the National Economic Council; Arati Prabhakar, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy; Cecilia Rouse, chair of the Council of Economic Advisors; and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan – wrote that Congress “should expand regulators’ powers to prevent misuses of customers’ assets … and to mitigate conflicts of interest.”  Other suggestions for Congress in the statement included strengthening transparency and disclosure requirements for crypto companies, strengthening penalties for violations of illicit-finance rules, and working more closely with international law enforcement partners.  The officials also made suggestions about what Congress should not do in terms of crafting new crypto regulation, including “greenlight[ing] mainstream institutions, like pension funds, to dive headlong into cryptocurrency markets.”  To do so, the officials warned, “would be a grave mistake” that “deepens ties between cryptocurrencies and the broader financial system.”  Though the spectacular collapses of neither the ill-fated LUNA stablecoin nor the now-defunct crypto exchange FTX were directly named in the statement, the effects of both loomed large over the officials’ guidance, which called 2022 “a tough year for cryptocurrencies” plagued by the implosion of “a so-called ‘stablecoin’ prompting a wave of insolvencies” and the subsequent downfall of “a major cryptocurrency exchange.”  “Some cryptocurrency entities ignore applicable financial regulations and basic risk controls … In addition, cryptocurrency platforms often mislead consumers, have conflicts of interest, fail to make adequate disclosures, or commit outright fraud,"" they wrote.  The White House’s concerns – as well as its recommendations – echo similar remarks made by U.S. regulators, including Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Commissioner Kristin Johnson, who called on Congress earlier this week to expand the CFTC’s authority to conduct due diligence on crypto acquisitions.  However, the responsibility to regulate crypto does not fall only on congressional shoulders.  In their statement, the four officials said the Biden administration itself would be unveiling “priorities for digital assets research development, which will help the technologies powering cryptocurrencies protect consumers by default” in “the coming months.”  “Safeguards will ensure that new technologies are secure and beneficial to all – and that the new digital economy works for the many, not just the few,” they wrote.

While the catalyst behind the rally might be unclear, Polygon’s (MATIC) bullish trend could be a part of its upcoming zkEVM Network update. As the launch draws near, investors have continued to increase in numbers pouring more funds into the asset. Polygon is a layer-2 scaling solution built on top of the Ethereum blockchain to improve the network’s scalability. The soon-to-be-launched zkEVM network update is just one of the plans the developers of the Polygon network have announced to enhance the layer-2 scaling solution. According to Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal’s recent tweet, the anticipated zkEVM comes soon as the mainnet launch now has an official date which is somewhere around the corner. Related Reading: Polygon-Ethereum ERC-20 Bridge Is the Most Active, Locks $2.18 Billion Polygon (MATIC) Surges Nearly 10% In 24 hours Over the past 24 hours, MATIC has spiked in price by 8.6%, mirroring other altcoins’ bullish trend as the global cryptocurrency market capitalization still holds steady above the previously amassed $1 trillion mark. The past few weeks have seen a MATIC mark an upward rally movement, especially since the beginning of the year. MATIC has moved from the $0.75 price tag seen late last year to $1.09 at the time of writing. Meanwhile, the 1-day chart still indicates more rallies as there is still liquidity at the higher highs to be taken. Notably, MATIC is ranked the 10th most valuable cryptocurrency asset by market capitalization, according to data aggregators CoinGecko and Coinmarketcap. Polygon currently has a market cap of $9.7 billion, higher than Solana with $8.8 billion but below Dogecoin, which sits at $11.8 billion. Though MATIC has been climbing highs since the beginning of the year, it is still far from its all-time high of $2.92, seen in 2021. With the ongoing disbelief in the crypto market among investors, it is still uncertain whether the zkEVM will be a good enough catalyst to drive its value beyond or closer to its peak.

The reason behind the plummet is still unclear, as the network activity is expected to increase, given the network’s recent collaborations with multiple top companies. Last year, Facebook (Meta) added support for the Polygon network. In addition, the layer-2 scaling solution recently partnered with Mastercard to launch a Web3 accelerator program to bring budding musical artists into the spotlight by leveraging Web3 technology and other blockchain-based innovations.

The ruling comes after court documents revealed executives from the crypto lender were granted pay raises of as much as $275,000 each after the company sought a bailout from crypto exchange FTX in June 2022. Dependent on FTX for a $400 million line of credit, BlockFi filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection shortly FTX did the same in November.  This new deal applies to around 130 staff, who will mostly get a bonus worth 42.5% of salary, paid in three installments over a year.

The new company will assume Gryphon's name and be headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada, after the deal closes, according to a statement. The miner's current equity holders are expected to own about 92.5% of the new publicly traded entity, while Akerna's shareholders will own about 7.5%, the statement added.  The CEO of Gryphon, Rob Chang, will be the new CEO of the publicly traded company. The CEO of Akerna, Jessica Billingsley, will be on the board of the new company, and six of the remaining seven members will be designated by Gryphon.  Akerna's top three investors include Vanguard (2.6% ownership as of Sept. 2022), Perkins Capital (2% as of Dec. 2022) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (1.2% as of Sept. 2022), according to FactSet data.  The deal comes after Gryphon terminated its drawn-out process to go public via a reverse merger with publicly traded data management firm, Sphere 3D (ANY). The proposed deal was announced in 2021, and the closing of the deal was pushed back multiple times due to the complicated regulatory approval process before the deal was eventually terminated.

According to the report, SkyBridge’s largest fund, with $1.3 billion of assets at the end of the third quarter, had one of its worst months in November, the month FTX filed for bankruptcy protection.  The decline sparked a sizable move by investors for a return of their money, with requests for the redemption of 60% of the firm's capital at the Sept. 30 deadline, according to the report. Only 10% of that had been returned, according to a January filing.  SkyBridge previously gave investors four redemption periods during the year with a promise of returning at least 25% in cash each quarter. That's now been cut to two, according to Bloomberg.  A SkyBridge representative declined to comment to Bloomberg.  Among SkyBridge's backers is FTX, with FTX Ventures announcing in September the purchase of a 30% stake in the asset manager. After the collapse of FTX in early November, Scaramucci said he was looking into buying back the equity.  The rough period hasn't seemed to dent Scaramucci's crypto optimism. “I’m encouraging people to invest now,” he told CoinDeskTV in a Jan. 18 interview. “We’re closer to a bottom than we are to another top.""

8332529,https://newsbtc.com/?p=517735,1674833455,Bitcoin Investors Turn Greedy For First Time Since March 2022,"Data shows investors in the Bitcoin market have turned greedy for the first time since March 2022, after what was the longest stretch of fear ever. Bitcoin Fear And Greed Index Now Points At “Greed” The “fear and greed index” is an indicator that tells us about the general sentiment among investors in the Bitcoin (as well as the wider crypto) market. To represent this sentiment, the metric uses a numeric scale that runs from 0-100. All values below 50 imply a fearful market, while those above this threshold suggest greedy holders. Although this cutoff point might look clean in theory, in practice, the region between values of 46 and 54 is generally considered to belong to a “neutral” sentiment. Real breakouts towards fear or greed only take place when the metric crosses below or above this transition region. There are also two other “special” sentiments: extreme greed and extreme fear. The former occurs above values of 75, while the latter happens under values of 25. The significance of these extreme sentiments is that tops and bottoms have historically tended to form when the investors have held these mentalities. Because of this, some traders believe extreme fear periods provide ideal buying opportunities (as bottoms have taken place here), while times with extreme greed could be the best selling windows (since tops occur here). Related Reading: CryptoQuant’s Bitcoin PnL Index Forms Bullish Crossover A trading strategy called “contrarian investing” is based on a similar idea. As Warren Buffet said in his famous quote, “be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” Now, here is how the current sentiment among Bitcoin (and wider crypto) investors looks like: A greedy cryptocurrency sector | Source: Alternative As can be seen above, the Bitcoin fear and greed index has a value of 55 right now, suggesting that the market has now properly entered into the greed zone. Before this break into the region, the sector had been in the fear region nonstop since March 2022, around ten months ago. Related Reading: Litecoin Whale Transactions Set New 2023 High, Bullish Signal? The below chart shows how the metric’s value has changed during the past year. Looks like the metric has observed some growth in recent days | Source: Alternative From the graph, it’s visible that the indicator had spent almost the entire past year not just in the fear zone, but actually all the way down in the extreme fear region. There was only one proper spike into greed during this period, and that was the aforementioned March 2022 instance. This previous surge had only lasted for a single day before the market became fearful again. These continuous streaks of fear and extreme fear during the past year were both the longest runs in the history of the indicator. Greed finally returning to the Bitcoin market after all this while could mean that investors are ready to embrace some bullish action once again, which could be a positive sign for the current rally.

The SEC has done a lot since late last year to safeguard crypto-focused customers and help prevent firms with exposure to the space from blowing up in the same way that FTX ( FTT-USD ) did, i.e., poor bookkeeping, lack of internal controls and co-mingling of client funds. For example, the regulator advised publicly-traded companies on Dec. 8 to disclose to investors any potential impacts from the languished crypto market. Enforcement staff at the SEC are seeking information about what traditional financial (TradFi) firms did to evaluate custody for trading platforms, including FTX ( FTT-USD ), one of the sources told Reuters, as clients' crypto is usually stored with a third party.

However, this opens the central bank to criticisms that CBDCs could be used as a surveillance tool not only by itself, but by banks and payment service providers that are part of the CBDC ecosystem.  Also, authorities could theoretically censor specific users and transactions, thereby impairing user freedoms. Storing and collecting personal and transaction information could ultimately lead to price discrimination for CBDC users and increase their cybersecurity risks. In the case of a hack, the leakage of personal information could lead, in the most extreme case, to financial losses that the central bank and/or its agents may be obliged to cover.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s Policy Week. John Kiff, a former senior financial sector expert at the IMF, is the research director at the Sovereign Official Digital Association (SODA), head of CBDC/digital capital markets advisory at Satoshi Capital Advisers and advisor to WhisperCash. Dr. Jonas Gross is chairman of the Digital Euro Association (DEA) and chief operating officer at etonec.  Due to these reasons, enabling high privacy for CBDC transactions is crucial.  What do we mean by ‘privacy’ and how private are existing digital payment rails?  Although privacy is a fundamental civil right, e.g., specified in Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the United Nations, its application is not necessarily black and white, and different forms of money differ in terms of their degree of privacy.  Cash is the most private form of money. If a payment is conducted with cash, only the two transaction parties involved know the information about the transaction, such as transaction amount and transaction parties. No third party can observe any payment-related data.  Today, the public already accepts some financial privacy invasion. Existing digital payment methods, such as debit and credit cards, bank account transfers and mobile money payments do not have a high degree of privacy – and are growing in market share. Know-your-customer (KYC) measures are necessary to open bank accounts and, ultimately, to conduct transactions. That confidential KYC and transaction data is shared with intermediaries, such as banks, credit card companies, etc., that are involved in the transaction process.  See also: What Is KYC and Why Does It Matter For Crypto?  According to a recent survey by the European Central Bank (ECB), in the European Union (EU), the volume of digital payments has in 2022 – for the first time – overtaken the volume of cash payments. However, the survey also revealed that the high privacy of cash is a feature that is highly appreciated, indicating strong demand for privacy-oriented payment methods.  High privacy for payments, however, also has a general drawback. As transaction data remains private, it is more difficult for financial institutions to comply with Financial Action Task Force (FATF) anti-money laundering, countering terrorist financing and combating proliferation financing (AML/CFT/CPF) standards. Per definition, transaction data would not be shared with third parties making it challenging – and in some cases impossible – to identify the parties involved, study the origin of funds, etc.  With a view to the discussion on privacy and compliance, how private are CBDC payments? There is no general answer to this question. It ultimately depends on the CBDC design and the goals of the central bank. As mentioned, privacy is not black or white. Privacy of CBDCs will differ across jurisdictions.  The European Central Bank (ECB), for example, sees four possible forms and degrees of transaction data privacy around a potential digital euro. These privacy provisions are listed in order from little to complete:  Fully transparent to the central bank: All transaction and KYC data is visible for the central bank  Transparent to intermediaries: All transaction and KYC data is visible to intermediaries  Privacy threshold: High degree of privacy for low-value transactions, while large-value transactions are subject to standard customer due diligence checks, typically implemented via limits built into digital wallets. The ECB has tested out non-transferrable ”anonymity vouchers” that allow users to transfer a limited amount of CBDC over a defined period with a higher degree of privacy. One key question around a privacy threshold is if the end-users need to trust the central bank for preserving privacy, e.g., in a sense that the central bank guarantees not to look into data for large-volume transactions or monetize data, or if privacy is independent of the central bank, e.g., implemented via privacy-oriented cryptographic techniques, such as zero-knowledge-proofs or blind signatures.  Non-transparent to third parties: Holdings/balances and transaction amounts are not known to intermediaries and the central bank. In the most extreme case, this can mean full anonymity, where – as for cash payments today – the identity of users is not known and no KYC measures are conducted, except when onboarding.  The privacy threshold model seems to be the preferred compromise between guaranteeing privacy of payments, while accounting for regulatory requirements, in retail CBDC launches and pilots. Countries like China, Nigeria and the Bahamas use such a model for their CBDCs.  See also: China Launches Smart-Contract Functionality on Digital Yuan Through E-Commerce App Meituan  However, the ECB, which conducted a survey and found that privacy is the most demanded feature for a digital euro, uses a so-called “transparent towards intermediary” framework. This “baseline model,” the envisioned design so far, is meant to satisfy AML/CFT demands, though may come into conflict with the general public’s demand for high privacy.  New technological approaches for balancing payment privacy and regulatory compliance  The degree of privacy of a CBDC has an important effect on adoption. It impacts if people see central bank systems as a substitute for cash or for digital forms of payments – which have separate uses. If users have strong preferences for privacy, a CBDC that has cash-like attributes could lead to higher usage and impinge less on bank deposits.  Technology solutions – both software- and hardware-based – have been developed that offer ways for CBDCs to enable a high degree of privacy while complying with regulation, such as:  Gross et al. (2021) have proposed a CBDC system that enables cash-like private CBDC transactions up to specific monetary limits. If these limits are reached, transactions above the limit have similar (lower) degrees of privacy as existing digital payment platforms. Limits can be specified in terms of transaction size, holdings and/or turnover. The system works best with the availability of a unique digital ID available to all users but such a digital ID is not a requirement. High privacy guarantees and compliance with limits are ensured via the use of cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs.  Chaum and Moser (2022) have proposed a CBDC system based on blind signatures that allows central banks to issue tokens through payment service providers without knowing who owns specific tokens. The central bank holds a ledger of all coin identifiers, so no one can mint new tokens, but transactions between wallets are not recorded. However, if users want law enforcement to trace stolen tokens, they can give up the privacy of their tokens. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub's Swiss Centre has launched Project Tourbillon which will build and test this eCash 2.0 platform.  CBDC hardware solutions that take the form of a card or a mobile wallet app on which prepaid values are stored locally also open the possibility of almost complete anonymity. Such wallets could conceivably be as anonymous and private as physical cash, although the central bank may require identification to enforce a one-wallet-per-person policy or holding and/or transaction size limits to mitigate financial integrity risk. Giesecke+Devrient has been testing a card-based CBDC platform in Ghana that allows for unlimited consecutive offline transactions.  The point is, as noted in this 2021 paper, the degree of data privacy to choose for a CBDC is not a technological question. Technologically, all degrees of privacy can be reached.  See also: What Will 2023 Bring for CBDCs?  It is rather a political and policy question. With retail CBDC launches and pilots attracting underwhelming user interest, to put it mildly, it is now time to consider more cash-like, privacy-focused CBDC solutions. A CBDC can only become a success if it addresses relevant user needs – and has sufficient trust from society.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | RESEARCH,"John Kiff, Jonas Gross",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/01/27/are-there-tech-solutions-to-the-privacy-and-compliance-trade-offs-for-cbdcs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/39f8449cad68a0274f938b62f2adf305da498611-5311x3541.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421391,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnziv,1674832344,Regulatory Clarity? Financial Watchdogs Could Not Be More Clear,"In settling a lawsuit in January with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the co-founder of crypto platform Nexo stated that he is “confident that a clearer regulatory landscape will emerge soon, and companies like Nexo will be able to offer value-creating products in the United States in a compliant manner.”  Nexo’s desire for “regulatory clarity” is far from unique: Over the past year, the executives of Binance, Coinbase and Circle have issued similar statements and “regulatory clarity” has been the buzz phrase at crypto panel discussions and happy hours.  Gareth Rhodes, a managing director at Pacific Street, formerly served as deputy superintendent and special counsel at the New York State Department of Financial Services. This article is part of CoinDesk’s Policy Week.  Implicit in these statements is the assumption that “regulatory clarity” is currently absent, and a suggestion that resolving this is critical for the future of the industry. However, the recent flurry of regulatory actions – including the U.S. Department of Justice’s (DOJ) case against former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, SEC lawsuits against crypto lender Genesis and the Gemini crypto exchange, the U.S. Treasury Department’s sanctions against mixer Tornado Cash and state-level actions against Celsius Network – indicate that those in charge of enforcing the laws believe the current regulatory framework is sufficient for their purposes.  What is meant by regulatory clarity? The U.S. Congress has the power to draft and pass laws that direct government agencies such as the SEC and DOJ to issue rules, supervise entities and conduct enforcement. With the assistance of court decisions and the rulemaking process, as well as agency guidance and precedent from enforcement actions, a picture comes into view of how those charged with enforcing the law and regulating the industry may act.  See also: Gareth Rhodes – The Impact of Avraham Eisenberg's Case on the Future of Crypto | Opinion  Such examples include whether the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) may approve an application, or whether facts uncovered in an investigation may lead a prosecutor to pursue criminal charges. Nexo’s and the other calls for “regulatory clarity,” in its most basic form, translates to a desire for more transparency into how regulatory and law enforcement agencies will act in regards to crypto-related products and services.  Without weighing in on the underlying merits of the recent enforcement actions and other regulatory decisions (there are compendiums of persuasive writings on the extent to which crypto should be evaluated under the existing regulatory structure, which is a topic beyond the scope of this column), there is ample evidence that in the eyes of those who approve applications and enforce the law, there is little need for further regulatory clarity. It exists right now.  What does this mean and what are the implications of this for 2023 and beyond? A few possibilities:  1. Regulators have shown they are comfortable applying existing laws to crypto, and crypto entities will likely have to adjust strategy  When asked in November about applying existing laws to crypto, SEC Chair Gary Gensler stated “[i]t’s just straightforward … [t]he rules are on the books already.”  It may seem strange that laws written pre-bitcoin are applied to crypto. However, this is standard practice across industries. Despite repeated calls from lawmakers of both parties, consumer advocates and the companies themselves, Congress has failed for decades to pass any large-scale, substantive legislation focusing on Big Tech and regulators rely on laws enacted before the internet even existed.  Likewise, the SEC regulates modern-day securities offerings based on a law passed in 1933 and the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1946 Howey ruling. Allegations of mail fraud, enacted in 1872 to combat counterfeit money, have been used repeatedly by prosecutors against a wide range of crimes, from prosecuting Charles Ponzi in 1920 to the recent college admissions scandal.  In short, regulators and prosecutors are practiced in applying Gilded Age-era laws to 2023 technologies, and their recent moves make it clear that they intend to follow the same practice in relation to crypto.  Of course there are strong arguments for why a bespoke set of rules is preferred for crypto (as well as Big Tech, social media and other industries). But rather than wait for new legislation that is unlikely to come based on the current political landscape, many crypto entities now face a decision whether to figure out how to comply based on the government’s interpretation of existing rules, or proceed knowing the risks of noncompliance.  2. Any additional “clarity” will most likely to come from the courts  To the extent additional “clarity” may come in 2023, the most likely source will not be Congress or a regulatory agency but the courts. In SEC v. Ripple Labs, a federal court may soon issue a more definitive ruling on the application of securities laws to crypto tokens. A similar question may be addressed in SEC v. Wahi, focusing on alleged insider trading by a former Coinbase employee. CFTC v. Eisenberg is expected to raise questions regarding how market manipulation rules apply to decentralized exchanges.  Then there’s the lawsuit filed by crypto lobbying group Coin Center against Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, following the criminalization of Tornado Cash, which may give a court the opportunity to review the application of various illicit finance laws to decentralized protocols running on open-source software. And while there are other key issues in the several cases versus Sam Bankman-Fried, a federal court may examine at what point sloppy risk management and poorly designed collateralized lending practices become criminal violations.  See also: Mark Lurie – Is the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) Holding Back Crypto Regulation? | Opinion  Each of these cases has the potential to solidify the government’s current approach to crypto, or provide new legal frameworks that may be preferred by industry participants.  3. Expect more offshore, less US-focused crypto activity  Recognizing that regulators intend to apply existing laws to crypto (often based on interpretations with which industry participants understandably disagree) it is likely that new and existing crypto entities will restrict services offered in the United States, finding the cost and complexity of compliance may outweigh the market benefit of serving American customers.  A recent statement issued by federal banking regulators expressing their view that crypto-related banking activities are “highly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices” will also create more challenges for crypto entities seeking to serve U.S. users.  Driving crypto activity to offshore exchanges can carry its own consequences. Remember that the recently imploded FTX was such an offshore exchange, based in the Bahamas and restricted to non-U.S. users.  Absent tighter supervision abroad, the industry may proliferate in jurisdictions with little to no regulatory infrastructure. Such an outcome would also reflect practical realities: Crypto’s adoption abroad is driven in part by real-use cases that have less application in the U.S., including serving as a financial alternative where authoritarian regimes can seize bank accounts, providing off-ramps from economies with runaway inflation and wherever foreign-exchange restrictions limit access to the U.S. dollar.  4. Incumbents that choose to build in the US  The upside for entities that successfully run the U.S. regulatory gauntlet is they will likely capture substantial market share and have a seal of compliance to attract investors and customers. In the unlikely scenario Congress does enact substantive crypto-focused legislation, this is likely to further entrench these incumbents because additional rules and complexity can serve as an effective barrier to entry for new, smaller competitors.  Unfortunately, even safeguards created by the existing regulatory framework do not insulate consumers from noncrypto financial risks (just ask this Iowa farmer who lost $900,000 investing in Texas medical facilities). Some policymakers may decide the legitimizing effects of a new crypto law outweigh the benefits that come from strengthened regulatory supervision, and opt to wait until the industry is more developed.  Clarity, or changes?  Nexo may wish for a “clearer regulatory landscape” but the regulators have made clear exactly how they view Nexo’s products and services. It appears what Nexo is seeking is not regulatory clarity but regulatory changes.  Indeed, in the press release announcing it has settled with the SEC, Nexo – after comparing itself to Uber and Airbnb – stated that because “innovators do not quite fit into existing provisions, constructive dialogue for the enhancement of the prevailing regulatory frameworks is of paramount importance.”  See also: Matt Homer – Crypto Gets the Regulation It Deserves | Opinion  Constructive dialogue and improving laws and regulation are certainly worthy objectives. However, regulatory and law enforcement agencies have made clear with words and actions that they believe crypto innovators do indeed “fit into existing provisions,” with Nexo serving as a prime example of how the government will continue to interpret and enforce laws in regards to crypto.  The regulatory “enhancements” or changes sought by Nexo and others are unlikely to occur absent new court decisions or legislation. Until then, it is up to crypto entities to decide whether they want to operate in the U.S. under the current framework, with the possibility of long-term benefits for those who take the plunge. (Nexo decided it did not, paid a $45 million fine and closed its U.S. business).",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Gareth Rhodes,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/01/27/regulatory-clarity-financial-watchdogs-could-not-be-more-clear,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a435f31d2258322cacff796f77ba8ab6180dd9a4-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It is negligibly complex and more compatible with other Aave V3 pools outside of Ethereum. The transition to Ethereum, expanding Aave’s presence in top blockchains, didn’t immediately affect its total value locked (TVL). Data show that it is 2% lower in the past 24 hours. However, TVL is up 24% in the last month, rising to $4.56 billion as of the time of writing on January 27, according to data streams from DeFiLlama. Aave is now the fourth largest DeFi protocol by TVL, trailing Lido Finance, MakerDAO, and Curve. However, the dApp is the second-largest lending protocol by TVL, behind MakerDAO. By launching on Ethereum, and upgrading from the original V2, the protocol’s TVL might gradually increase over the coming weeks or months. This, in turn, may positively impact AAVE prices. Aave is a decentralized money market, allowing crypto holders to actively lend and borrow various assets. Integrating V3 on Ethereum avails the protocol on six other platforms, including Avalanche, Polygon, and Harmony. Polygon is compatible with Ethereum’s virtual machine, existing as a layer-2 protocol enabling higher scalability and significantly lower trading fees. What Aave V3 Brings Developers claim Aave V3 introduces various changes that, as the co-founder said, make lending and borrowing more seamless and cheaper. According to the protocol, this version is optimized to reduce gas costs by around 20-25% across the board. Users can also move assets across all Aave markets, irrespective of the network.

Its utility and governance token, T, has been on the rise since the start of 2023 as the network produced more buzz. The coin is up 146% in the weekly, becoming the biggest gainer in the top 100 crypto list of CoinMarketCap today. Related Reading: Polkadot Hints At Price Recovery – Can DOT Go Past 15% Weekly Ceiling? On-Chain, Off-Chain Developments List Threshold On January 26th, centralized exchange CoinBase announced the support for the Threshold token. This listing would enable the token to gather momentum in the retail investor space. The dev team is also focused on developing its tBTC project, a way for Bitcoin holders to use their coins on Ethereum-based DeFi. Coinbase will add support for Audius (AUDIO) and Threshold (T) on the Ethereum network (ERC-20 token). Do not send this asset over other networks or your funds may be lost. — Coinbase Assets (@CoinbaseAssets) January 25, 2023 According to Threshold’s blog post earlier this week, the network’s early launch of its Bitcoin-Ethereum bridge was a response to the recent developments in the world of bridging the two major cryptocurrencies. Threshold (T). Image: Freepik A Quick Definition Of Threshold (T) The T token is a cryptocurrency that serves multiple purposes, including making payments, influencing the direction of the project through voting, and staking for interest and other incentives. It is one of the most significant Web3 initiatives because of the cross-chain element of the network and the privacy and access control features it employs. Threshold is not your normal cryptocurrency, as it does not want to make its users wealthy through trading and investment, nor does it strive to ensure that transactions are completed in the quickest possible time. Although it does not provide NFTs or a metaverse, it does come with a number of DeFi features. What Does This Mean For Threshold (T)? The token has reached new highs after the CoinBase listing announcement. Threshold is currently trying to break above $0.064 which it has been unsuccessful in doing so. Threshold is supported at $0.042, the same support level that has not eased the May to June crypto market crash levels. If the token suffers a correction phase, T might revert back $0.033 support which could possibly blunt a bearish market movement.

In the short to medium term, investors and traders of the token should expect volatility to enter the market if the token ends today unable to inch up to its desired targets. Meanwhile, as this scenario might play out, Bitcoin is attempting to breach the $23k resistance. If BTC breaches through this resistance, Threshold can rely on its somewhat high correlation with the king crypto to boost gains. -Featured image by Aviationist",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | ICO | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://newsbtc.com/news/threshold-t-swells-146/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/8328691.jpeg

MATIC was recently trading at $1.11. It is up 48% since Dec. 31 amid a spike in daily transactions that have made the blockchain the second largest for daily active users, according to data from Token Terminal. Decentralized exchange Gains Network has recorded over $1.5 billion in trading volume on the Arbitrum blockchain nearly a month after being deployed. Gains Network was initially released on Polygon and has contributed to the increase in the number of transactions being conducted on that network. It allows users to trade financial derivatives of various assets, such as tokens, U.S. stocks and indexes by matching user trades using smart contracts.  The price of layer 2 network Optimism’s OP token has also surged over the past week.OP reached an all-time high of over $2.50 on Wednesday amid rising adoption of layer 2 networks. “People want layer 2 tokens, and they see layer 2 adoptions happening,” said Nick Hotz, vice president of research at the digital asset-management firm Arca, referring to the tokens associated with companion blockchain systems. “Optimism is the only way to get good exposure to that theme currently.” The OP token’s jump has outpaced the top two digital assets by market capitalization, bitcoin and ether, which have risen 39% and 33%, respectively, in 2023.  Developers behind the shuttered decentralized crypto exchange Mango Markets say they are pushing forward with a relaunch of the project – even as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleges the project’s native token, MNGO, is a security. The SEC’s labeling of the token raises knotty problems about whether Mango Markets’ “version 4” can proceed without facing regulators’ wrath. The SEC hasn’t alleged wrongdoing by Mango. But the agency last week accused MNGO trader Avraham Eisenberg, who drained $116 million from the exchange in October, of securities market manipulation. Securities lawyers who aren’t involved in the case told CoinDesk the SEC might be laying the groundwork to bring a case against the exchange that issued MNGO to its investors when it launched in 2021.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows changes in bitcoin's price three hours before and after the monthly releases of the U.S. Consumer Price Index since January 2021.  Volatility around CPI releases has increased over the past 12 months, indicating that macroeconomic data has more influence on the cryptocurrency than ever.  The next CPI release is scheduled for Feb. 14.

42413032,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7Mru,1674822472,Bitcoin Miner Argo Blockchain Faces Class-Action Suit Over US Share Sale,"Argo Blockchain, a crypto miner whose shares trade on the London Stock Exchange (ARB) and Nasdaq (ARBK), is facing a class-action lawsuit over alleged misleading statements made during the initial public offering (IPO) of its American depositary shares (ADS) in 2021.  The London-based company made untrue or incomplete statements, failing ""to state other facts necessary to make the statements made not misleading,"" according to a filing dated Jan. 26 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York.  Argo is accused of failing to disclose that it suffered from significant capital constraints, as well as electricity and network difficulties. These constraints hampered the firm's ability to mine bitcoin and operate its Helios facility in Texas. Although the complaint was filed as class action, it doesn't actually become one until a judge assigns it that status.  ""Argo’s business was less sustainable than Defendants had led investors to believe; accordingly, Argo’s business and financial prospects were overstated,"" according to the filing. The mining firm offered 7.5 million ADS, each representing 10 shares of common stock, on the Nasdaq Global Market in September, 2021. However, 2022 was not kind to Argo, nor to its peers in the bitcoin mining industry. Firms were squeezed between falling crypto valuations and rising electricity costs. The pressures culminated in bankruptcy for one of the industry's biggest miners, Core Scientific.  Argo narrowly avoided the same fate by selling the Helios facility to Mike Novogratz’s crypto-focused financial-services firm Galaxy Digital for $65 million and a $35 million loan.  The sale helped lift Argo's shares, which slumped more than 90% last year. The London-based stock has more than doubled in January, and the U.S. shares, which were at risk of being suspended, have also recovered.  Argo's LSE-listed shares are down over 3% at 15.94 pence as of midday in London. At the time of writing, ARBK shares on Nasdaq are down about 4% at $1.95 in pre-market trading.  Argo had not responded to CoinDesk's request for comment at press time.

According to CoinMarketCap, DOGE has only risen 5.56% in the past week with its biggest gains seen in the monthly time frame. At its current market cap of $11.3 billion, the token is surpassed by other altcoins in terms of growth. However, DOGE still remains a dominant force in the world of memecoins as it has been for a long time. Related Reading: Polkadot Hints At Price Recovery – Can DOT Go Past 15% Weekly Ceiling? DOGE Compared To Other Memecoins Compared to its peers, Dogecoin is still a popular choice for investors in the crypto industry. In terms of market cap, the token dominates SHIB by a wider margin. Even with Shiba Inu disrupting DOGE’s dominance, it still has a long way to go for SHIB to be level with DOGE. However, Shiba Inu has been distancing itself from its memecoin past. With Shibarium around the corner, we might see SHIB gain more dominance in space. Since last year, Dogecoin has been silent in the development space with the only spike in activity being the October 2022 upgrade of the token’s wallet. But external developments still favor DOGE. According to recent news about Tesla’s financials, the company has not bought or sold Bitcoin for two consecutive quarters. Despite this, the company still only accepts DOGE for crypto payments. This gives DOGE some real life utility as a form of payment. However, with the electric vehicle industry facing a tougher time right now, we might see DOGE perform poorly compared to other memecoins, or altcoins in that matter, in the foreseeable future. Sideways Movement Continues For DOGE As the time of writing, the price movement of DOGE has stagnated and started to oscillate above and below $0.08.

Although the regulator has faced criticism for taking a tough stance on crypto, he deemed it necessary, FCA CEO Nikhil Rathi said in a meeting last November.

8323095,https://newsbtc.com/?p=517731,1674819027,Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Could Face Make Or Break Moment,"The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price could be facing a make-or-break moment in the coming weeks. While the launch of Shibarium is imminent according to the chief developer, the success of the layer-2 blockchain and the emerging ecosystem could determine how the SHIB price will perform. Despite the 43% year-to-date (YTD) price increase, SHIB is still in bearish territory. Ultimately, SHIB needs another boost, whether from a macro perspective or from the successful launch of Shibarium, to return to the bullish ground. The 1-day chart reveals that SHIB is still writing low highs on a daily basis since August last year. However, the year-to-date rally could be the start of a major move to the upside. For now, SHIB has seen a retest of the support zone at $0.000011, but could now push ahead with its rise. If not, there could be more downsides for SHIB. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Declines 6%, Gets Flipped By Litecoin In Market Cap Again At the moment, SHIB is seeing support from the 200-day EMA at $0.00001125. If the price manages to stay above this level, the first target could be the January 18 high of $0.00001292, in order to write a new local high. After that, there would be a possibility of SHIB making a new attempt to break the high of $0.00001519 from October 29. Achieving success could mean a return to the bullish territory. However, the final, biggest hurdle, for now, will be the resistance zone between $0.00001691 and $0.00001799. Shibarium And Whales In The Spotlight For Shiba Inu A look at the fundamentals also reveals a make-or-break moment. With the much-hyped launch of Shibarium, it remains to be seen whether Shiba Inu can grow beyond its meme coin status. The project is a layer 2 solution for the Ethereum-based network and aims to lay the foundation for building a powerful ecosystem that hosts a metaverse, a decentralized exchange (DEX), blockchain-based games, and NFTs. The decentralized exchange Shiba SwapDEX launched back in July 2021 and reached a TVL of $1.66 billion at the time, but is down to $30 million. Shibarium could give new life to the exchange. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Is Up 4% As Lead Dev Teases Exact Beta Launch Date In general, however, Shiba Inu will have to prove itself if its move away from a pure meme narrative is to be successful. If the fundamentals are right, the price will follow. If Shibarium is a disappointment, the SHIB price could see further downside. Meanwhile, the popularity of SHIB among Ethereum whales points to a bullish sentiment. A SHIB community member shared data from WhaleStats, according to which SHIB is the top-held non-stablecoin by Ethereum whales. SHIB accounts for 15.76%, only outpaced by USDT (19.52%).

In total, Robinhood holds $3.37 billion worth of assets on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains. These break down as follows: $2.99 billion ETH (88%), $266 million SHIB (8%), and $54 million MATIC (1.6%). At press time, the SHIB price stood at $0.00001152.

Gains Network was initially released on Polygon and has contributed to the recent rising transactional activity on that network. It allows users to trade financial derivatives of various assets, such as tokens, U.S. stocks and indices by matching user trades using smart contracts.  Such offerings have piqued the interest of global traders, who may otherwise be unable to trade U.S.-listed instruments without relying on banks and complying with extensive Know You Customer (KYC) requirements.  Data shows that the platform has processed over $25 billion worth of trading volume – all without relying on third parties – on the Polygon and Arbitrum networks. Stakers are earning 10% on their deposited GNS tokens as of Friday.  The $1.5 billion in trading volume on Arbitrum has generated $1.1 million in fees for users providing liquidity to the platform, data from Dune Analytics shows, which has added to the utility of the platform’s native GNS token.  Over $220 million in trading volume was processed in the past 24 hours. Over $120 million of that came from crypto derivatives and $70 million from products tracking foreign currency, with the remaining spread over U.S.-listed stocks such as Apple (APPL) and Amazon (AMZN), and indices.  As such, Gains Network earlier this week started a trading contest with $100,000 in total rewards for traders, which may have contributed to a recent bump in volume.

He also added that no one asks for the “dumb” global fiat system to be shut down. Related Reading: 80% Of Uniswap Holders Support BNB PoS Chain For Deploying V3 Protocol Instead of opposing technology and infringing on people’s rights, he recommends that opposers let people do what they want and chill. People rooting for crypto to be shut down are incredibly cringe. Like no one is trying to shut down the dumb fiat system you use, no one is forcing you to buy crypto; no one is forcing you to read crypto news or follow crypto Twitter. Let people do what they want and chill. It is not immediately clear what triggered Hayden to vent his frustrations on Twitter. However, what’s known is that no-coiners, individuals who are against crypto, hold no coin, or show no desire to participate, have been shooting down blockchain and crypto proponents. Tackling Nocoiners Over the years, crypto’s volatility has been called into question, with many regulators and heads of agencies slamming top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Billionaire Warren Buffet and economist Nouriel Roubini, nicknamed Dr. Doom, lead the pack. In the aftermath of the FTX collapse, while attending the Abu Dhabi Finance Week, Nouriel said Binance’s CEO, Changpeng Zhao, was a “ticking time bomb,” and he was surprised that Binance had been allowed to operate in the Gulf state. He wants regulators across the world to “think carefully” about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. As of January 27, the price of Bitcoin was changing hands at around $23,000. Like Warren, Dr. Doom says cryptocurrencies, with which Hayden made a platform for easy trading, hold no intrinsic value. He always insists that crypto is the biggest scam in financial history. Nouriel mainly blames regulators in the United States for being “lenient”. Crypto is the biggest scam ever in financial history. Their true value isn’t 0; it is rather negative, given their negative externalities. 100s of celebrities handsomely profited by peddling criminal shit coins and crypto scams, shafting suckers. The current fines are only a slap on the wrist. They should be prosecuted. Uniswap is a leading cryptocurrency exchange, allowing for the trustless exchange of various tokens and NFTs.

8319120,https://newsbtc.com/?p=517727,1674813059,Bitcoin Supply In Loss Hits A 9-Month Low,"According to on-chain data from CryptoQuant, a blockchain analytics platform, the Bitcoin supply in loss with the seven-day moving average stands at 32%, a nine-month low. This is the lowest level since April 2022, when the Bitcoin price was changing hands at the $40,000 range. Bitcoin Supply In Loss At 32% The Bitcoin supply in loss is a metric that measures the absolute number of coins presently in the loss-making territory. This data compares the price at which the coin in consideration was last moved and the spot rate. If the price is lower than the current price, then the coin is at loss. The metric doesn’t quantify the size of the loss. Instead, it states whether it is in profits or loss without giving precise figures on each coin’s profitability or loss. For traders, how the supply in loss changes over time could be used to pick out price bottoms or tops. Notably, analytic platforms say investors keep tabs, using the metric to timely enter or exit the market. Historically, when the supply in loss is within the 50-60% range, Bitcoin prices could be bottoming. Presently, as per on-chain data, the Bitcoin supply in loss stands at 32%, the lowest in nine months, and could indicate that a trend reversal is imminent. According to an analyst, citing on-chain data from CryptoQuant, prices capitulate every time the Bitcoin supply in loss rises above 50%. Tops or peaks can be better timed by combining the supply in loss and the supply in profit lines. The supply in profit tracker uses the same principle as its counterpart, supply in loss. However, it only considers the number of coins in profit since the last time they were moved. They move in the opposite direction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Loss Reaches 50% As BTC Drops Below $20k After prices fell to 2022 lows in November 2022, the Bitcoin supply in loss decreased while those in profits increased. Considering the state of price action, when the two lines, representing supply and loss, cross each other, analysts can easily identify the point of reversals. The last time supply in loss crossed above supply in profit was in March 2020. Then, the Bitcoin prices rallied upwards from $5,000. 61% Of BTC Holders Are In Profit With rising Bitcoin prices, most coin holders are in profit. Parallel data from IntoTheBlock reveals that 61% of coin holders are in the money. Only 36% are in red, and just 3% are at break even.

42414541,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBAiWX,1674811453,Floki Inu Developers Float DAO Proposal to Burn $55M of Its Own Tokens,"Developers behind Floki Inu, the Shiba Inu dog breed-themed project, have floated a governance proposal to burn nearly $55 million of its namesake FLOKI tokens and reduce a tax levied on each transaction.  Burning tokens is a way of reducing supply, which subsequently adds value to each token as long as the level of demand remains the same. The Floki team hopes to position the project as serious decentralized finance (DeFi) contender. “Floki's latest DAO vote makes it clear that Floki is more than just a meme coin,” B, a Floki core team member told CoinDesk, referring to a decentralized autonomous organization.  “Floki has demonstrated a strong focus on utility and fundamentals: through the mainnet release of our FlokiFi Locker protocol and the first major testnet release of our metaverse game Valhalla in a bear market,” the core team member added.  The proposal also pointed out security risks associated with bridges as another rationale. Last year alone saw over $2 billion lost or stolen from cross-chain bridges, as CoinDesk reported.  “More exploits and data have emerged to show how much of a threat cross-chain bridges could pose, especially if they hold a significant amount of a token’s supply,” the proposal stated.  “In Floki’s case, an exploit on our main cross-chain bridge would have a catastrophic impact on the project since this bridge currently holds 55.7% of what FLOKI’s total circulating supply should be. This is a lot of tokens, and that’s more than enough to drain the project’s liquidity pools and essentially destroy the project if exploited,” they added.  If this proposal passes, some 4.97 trillion FLOKI tokens in the Floki bridge will be burnt while the self-imposed buy and sell tax on each transaction would be reduced to 0.3%. The bridge would also be permanently disabled.  At writing time on Friday, an overwhelming 99% of all voters were in support of the newly floated proposal, the governance forum shows.  Bridges refer to a blockchain-based tool that allows users to transfer tokens between different networks.  The Floki bridge  Floki initially issued its token on Ethereum with a total supply of 10 trillion tokens before eventually expanding to the faster and cheaper BNB Chain in 2021, after community requests.  The team had to launch another contract on the BNB Chain with its own total supply of 10 trillion tokens. However, this required a cross-chain bridge to ensure the FLOKI total circulating supply at any given time never exceed a total supply of 10 trillion tokens and to allow for users to transfer their FLOKI from Ethereum to BNB Chain and vice versa.  At the time, the team used 600 billion tokens from its treasury on Ethereum and BNB Chain to provide the initial funds for the bridge.  Since then, most holders locked their FLOKI tokens on Ethereum and transferred those out on BNB Chain. “As a result of this, while the majority of the supply is still on the [Ethereum] chain there is now such a balance that the absence of a bridge would not threaten the stability of project,” developers wrote in the proposal.  FLOKI remained nominally changed over the past 24 hours, data from CoinGecko show. The tokens have appreciated 6% in the past week.",POSITIVE,BNB | FLOKI,ETH | REGULATION | SHIB | BNB | FLOKI,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/27/floki-inu-developers-float-dao-proposal-to-burn-55m-of-its-own-tokens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/057892391a95a5a26e82710f19b26a7341d32bc8-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414549,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBAjdW,1674809436,"Bitcoin on Track for Best January Since 2013, Led by Bullish Trading During US Hours","Bitcoin (BTC) is having its best start to the year since 2013. The price of the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has jumped 40% this month amid weakness in the U.S. dollar. The rally has been powered predominantly by U.S. buyers, observers say.  ""Bitcoin is up +40% year to date with +35% of those returns occurring during U.S. trading hours. That's an 85% contribution of the rally associated with U.S.-based investors,"" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto services provider Matrixport, said in a note to clients on Friday.  ""We interpret this as a clear signal that U.S. institutions are buyers of bitcoin right now,"" Thielen added.  Bitcoin surged 51% in January 2013.  Unlike stocks, bitcoin – and cryptocurrencies in general – trade 24 hours, allowing observers to keep track of order flows across different time zones and infer the source of buying or selling pressure.  Institutions' bullish positioning is also evident from the renewed premium in bitcoin futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  ""Institutions are not only buying bitcoin spot; rather, we are also seeing consistently high premiums for perpetual futures. We interpret this as an indication that faster institutional traders and hedge funds are actively buying the recent dip in crypto markets,"" Thielen noted.  Deutsche Digital Assets made a similar observation earlier this month, drawing attention to the uptick in Coinbase premium as evidence of increased buying interest from sophisticated U.S.-based investors relative to retail investors.  ""Traditional and crypto-focused hedge funds, corporates and traditional asset managers have been buying,"" Coinbase Institutional's head of research, David Guong, wrote in a weekly market commentary published Jan. 20.  Bitcoin's institution-led bullish turnaround might be a good sign for the U.S. equity market, considering the cryptocurrency's record of bottoming out weeks ahead of the S&P 500.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/27/bitcoins-best-start-since-2020-led-by-bullish-us-trading-hours,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b2df6a3dfe66bc79259c67b46c285a5ac962f484-933x789.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

8316869,https://newsbtc.com/?p=517721,1674809029,"Bitcoin Hash Rate Registers New Highs, A Selloff Imminent?","Based on CryptoQuant data, one observer notes that whenever the Bitcoin hash rate records new highs, as is the case in late January 2023, coin prices tend to retrace as the upside momentum fades. Extending this preview on current BTC rates, the analyst predicts that prices may rise above the current resistance level at $23,800 to $25,500 before dumping below immediate support lines towards $20,000, or worse. Hash Rate Peaks Are Selling Signals? Per his analysis, expanding Bitcoin prices would encourage more users and mining farms to power on their rigs, further pushing up the hash rate. Based on his theory, the rising hash rate would be a precursor of strong liquidations that may unwind mining activity, pulling down prices. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Holds Key Support But The Bulls Seem To Be Losing Steam On January 26, the Bitcoin hash rate increased to 305 EH/s, an all-time high. Hash rate is the total computing power connected to the Bitcoin network. At the current pace, a new level will likely be registered if BTC prices continue pumping. While there appears to be a direct correlation between the spot BTC price and hash rate, the observer, citing on-chain data, thinks the opposite is true. He is convinced that peaking bitcoin hash rates can diverge with prices, impacting coin valuation. BTC just hit new ATH, and many might make you believe this is a bullish sign, but I will show you that it always had quite the opposite effect. I’ve been using hash rate all-time highs as bearish signals throughout 2022 with very good results. You can see all new ATHs. Even if you go back to 2021 ATHs on a live chart, you will see that all signaled an imminent selloff. Notably, the analyst pointed out occasions in 2021 and 2022 when rising hash rates led to significant price retracements after solid rallies. In seven events, the average selloff was a 19.5% drop in prices, with the deepest being 37%. Preceding this correction, he adds, the coin’s valuation tends to post an 11% maximum gain. From current Bitcoin prices, this places the coin above $25,000. Bitcoin Mining Clusters Are Forming Before prices expand, “clusters of intense Bitcoin mining activity,” tend to form, as is presently the case. Because of miner involvement, the hash rate moves up in tandem in quick succession, registering an all-time high. However, the sharp activity in mining and expansion of the hash rate led to strong selloffs, on average, within nine trading days. Related Reading: This Is How The Bitcoin Price Will Be Affected By Macro: Charles Edwards Per the current Bitcoin formation, the expansion in BTC prices above $25,000 may precede a cool-off, possibly forcing the coin back to $20,000 or, worse, $14,500 from early February 2023.

As per DeFiLlama, MinSwap is currently the largest Cardano DEX, locking $30 million in tokens, while MuesliSwap locks up a relatively smaller $6.5 million worth of liquidity.  The highly anticipated djed stablecoin has been jointly developed by Cardano code maintainer IOG and Coti, a layer 1 blockchain. Djed will be backed by other tokens and requires more than 400% in collateral value to be posted before it is issued to a user.  DEXs rely on smart contracts to match trades between users anonymously, without third parties. These users supply liquidity to trading pools, earning rewards in the form of tokens.  This overcollateralized mechanism would allow djed's value to hold stably during market stress and prevent a repeat of terraUSD, the infamous stablecoin linked to luna, which fell over 99% in May.  Shen, the reserve token meant to support djed's stability, would receive extra rewards when holders of Cardano's ADA cryptocurrency stake their coins to mint djed stablecoins, which may fuel liquidity for the upstart ecosystem.  The djed tokens – alongside annualized yield rewards offered by the DEXs – are expected to attract liquidity and interest from investors owing to their overcollaterized mechanism, which may overall benefit Cardano's $72 million decentralized finance (DeFi) market.  ""We are going to launch concentrated liquidity pools similar to UniSwap [version 3] next week with the Djed launch so we expect that the trading APR itself will already be above 10% as capital can be used more efficiently,"" a MuesliSwap developer told CoinDesk via Twitter message on Friday.  ""We are aiming for at least a 10%-15% farming APR for both the pairs ADA/$DJED and ADA/$SHEN. So, in total, we are aiming to be above 20-25% APR in the first month to attract liquidity,"" the developer added.  Djed is expected to go live on over 40 Cardano-based decentralized finance applications (dapps) on launch. Developers have simultaneously developed DjedPay, a payments application that uses djed, that would allow users to transfer the tokens to merchants and businesses.  Coti did not immediately respond to requests for comment at writing time.

The probe gathered pace in the aftermath of the implosion of crypto exchange FTX, the report said.  The SEC has been warning public companies that if they have a stake in the industry's recent crypto contagion, they'd better tell investors, as CoinDesk previously reported. The SEC asked if companies face any risks to their businesses “due to excessive redemptions, withdrawals or a suspension of redemptions or withdrawals, of crypto assets.”  The latest development is another sign of the market regulator increasing scrutiny at the intersection of traditional finance and crypto. The SEC is seeking details about what firms did to assess custody for platforms, including FTX, since clients' digital assets are typically stored with a third party.  One of the criteria for investment advisers to have custody of client funds or securities is that the firm is categorized as a ""qualified custodian."" The SEC says ""qualified custodians can be banks, registered broker-dealers, futures commission merchants, or certain foreign entities.""  The SEC declined to comment.

8310471,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4572877-has-bitcoin-bottomed?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1674797974,Has Bitcoin Bottomed? (Technical Analysis),"Summary Bitcoin has rallied over 30% in the last month. Market participants are calling a bottom, and so as a lot of the evidence. With that said, I remain sceptical of this rally, and even if a bottom is in, there is no need to chase here. Thesis Summary With the latest rally, many investors are calling for a Bitcoin (BTC-USD) bottom to be in. In this article, I present compelling evidence that this could be the case, though I still hold that, given the macroeconomic outlook, if not a new low, we should re-test these recent lows in the second half of the year. We’ve broken resistance; for now First and foremost, it is worth mentioning that, following the recent rally, Bitcoin has broken above the trendline resistance coming from the top of the bear market. This is an initial bullish signal, and combined with other metrics helps build a bullish case as long as we can remain above it. BTC Price and Hash ribbons (TradingView) Another key metric shown below the price chart is the hash ribbons. We can see below the Bitcoin price chart that the 30 day hash rate Moving Average has crossed above the 60 day MA. This has triggered a buy signal, which in the past has been a good indicator of an impending rally. The hash ribbons show a shift towards positive momentum in Bitcoin mining. The Halving Cycle BTC Halving Cycle (Seeking Alpha) The halving cycle has been a theory used to predict Bitcoin tops, bottoms and turns for some time, and so far it hasn’t failed. We can see that, since its inception, Bitcoin’s price follows very clear dynamics before and after each of its halving events, where the mining reward of Bitcoin is halved. Following halving events, Bitcoin rallies for around 2 years. This is followed by a bear market and a consolidation phase as we approach the next halving event. For reference, last time, Bitcoin bottomed 517 days before its halving. Bitcoin struck a low at $15,500, just around the 500-day mark Speaking of cycles, it’s also worth mentioning that in the last bear market, BTC spent 386 days beneath the 200-day MA, which we have broken above now, after 381 days beneath it. BTC 50 day MA (Author's work) On-chain metrics Some other interesting metrics can be found on the Blockchain itself. Since all transaction data is available to us, we can gain some interesting insights by examining what transactions have taken place and who has carried them out. BTC Realized Price (Author's work using data from Glassnode) In the chart above we can see a visual representation of the Realized Price, the Realized Price for Long-term holders and the Realized Price for Short-term holders. Now, the realized price, which I’ve talked about before, is the average price at which each Bitcoin moved last. In a way, it can be seen as the break-even point of the market. Below the realized price, the market is in losses, and when above, it is in profits. Now, we also have the Short-term holder realized price, which is the realized price for coins that have been held under 155 days, while the long-term holder realized price is the realized price of coins held over 155 days. It’s important to note that these are not static lines, even though they are represented as such in this chart. The value of the realized price changes with every transaction. This is why the STH Realized Price is the lowest of the three. This shows that a significant amount of coins moved during the last sell-off, which lowered the Realized price for this cohort. What’s notable is that the actual price has now broken above these three metrics, which has completely shifted the momentum in the market. People who have just bought Bitcoin are in profit, which could revive market sentiment. For a long time, Bitcoin has failed to push higher due to a lack of interest by the general public, who was still burned from the descent from all-time highs. As price climbs, this momentum shifts, and breaking above these profitability points is a key metric. What to look for moving forward So, has Bitcoin bottomed? The only adequate answer I can give is that there is insufficient evidence of this. For starters, we have yet to break above the 200-week moving average. Bitcoin outlook (Author's work) This metric is also watched closely in Bitcoin. In the past, it has acted as strong support in bear markets, but also as a strong resistance. The 200 week moving average currently stands at around $24,500. It’s interesting to see that the 50 week moving average is converging here and this is also very near where Bitcoin made a local top in May. From an Elliott Wave perspective, we also don’t have enough evidence to call for a bottom. We have yet to complete an initial five-wave impulse for a large degree wave 1. Once that is complete, we must see a corrective retracement that holds the recent low. This would be a good point to enter the market. But, still, we wouldn’t truly confirm a bottom is in until we rally back above the wave 1 high. Takeaway If we can break above the 200-week MA, then the next spot of resistance would be just south of $30,000. From there, I would expect a substantial pullback, which, if corrective, would give us an opportunity to go long back at around $20,000, though I can’t give exact levels. I am still sceptical of this rally since we haven't reached the Delta Price , but strong evidence supports the case that a bottom is in. Ultimately, these are good levels to build a position, and for those still uneasy, a clearer opportunity should present itself in a wave 2 pullback.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4572877-has-bitcoin-bottomed?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/8310471.jpeg

42414552,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBAjtR,1674783826,"First Mover Asia: Cryptos Shrug Off Latest US Productivity, Jobs Data; Bitcoin Hovers at $22.9K","Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: GDP cooled. Jobless claims sank, underlining the current tight job market and an economy that was still rising. But bitcoin and other cryptos were largely unimpressed by the latest data.  Insights: Litecoin has operated largely out of the spotlight, even as its price has held up better than other cryptocurrencies.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,078.95 −14.7 ▼ 1.3% Bitcoin (BTC) $22,892 −322.5 ▼ 1.4% Ethereum (ETH) $1,582 −41.5 ▼ 2.6% S&P 500 daily close  4,060.43 +44.2 ▲ 1.1% Gold  $1,931 −10.1 ▼ 0.5% Treasury Yield 10 Years  3.49% ▲ 0.0 BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices; gold is COMEX spot price. Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Bitcoin Remains Unimpressed by Latest GDP, Jobs Data  By James Rubin  Bitcoin was unimpressed by the latest U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) data, an unexpectedly small jump that suggested the economy was cooling, and jobless claims that indicated it was not.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading a little below its most recent $23,000 support line, down 1.4% over the past 24 hours. Still Bitcoin's more than 35% rise this year remains a feel-good story, even if analysts remain wary about its short-term prospects, along with those of other cryptos still reeling from the industry misdeeds of 2022.  ""An uptick in volume in conjunction with higher prices is generally a bullish sign,"" CoinDesk Crypto Markets Analyst Glenn Williams wrote in his weekday column. ""Flat prices however, signal that bullish and bearish investors are both actively expressing their market views.""  Ether followed a similar slightly reddish path to trade just below its current $1,600 support. Other major cryptos sank more deeply with layer 1 network Aptos Network's APT token recently plunging nearly 5% to lose some of the ample ground it gained earlier this week. APT was changing hands comfortably over $17, far removed from its levels around $3.50 at the start of the year. Ethereum scaling tool Polygon's MATIC token was the exception to Thursday's price trend, recently rising more than 7%. MATIC is up about 45% in 2023 amid a spike in daily transactions. The Polygon platform has the second-largest number of daily active users (DAU), according to data from Token Terminal.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, recently decreased about 1%.  Equity markets continued their uneven climb upward this year with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and the S&P 500, which has a hefty technology component, jumping 1.8% and 1.1%, respectively, even as fourth quarter earnings continued to tilt negative and a rising number of firms announced layoffs in anticipation of an economic contraction. Since the start of the year, Amazon, Microsoft, Salesforce and more recently IBM have announced job cuts.  The 2.5% rise in GDP and an unexpected decline in jobless claims on Thursday had little impact on the current investment environment, which turned cautiously hopeful that inflation will continue waning without the economy falling into deep recession. That combination would likely enable the U.S. central bank to ratchet back the size of its next interest rate hike next week.  In an interview on CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program, Jason Pagoulatos, markets associate at research group Delphi Digital, said that he didn't think the latest GDP would have a great affect on crypto markets. Pagoulatos said that instead, investors were eyeing the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision, although more for accompanying comments than whether Fed governors raise interest rates by 25 or 50 basis points.  ""The market knows that the rate hikes are going continue but at a slower pace until they reach whatever their terminal rate is,"" he said. ""The main question is that people are trying to get clarity over is how long and then what that ultimately means for things that are still showing signs of strength like the labor market.""

Markets data shows that it outperformed both bitcoin and ether throughout the year.  The Litecoin network has been around since 2011, a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain, and LTC is the first altcoin. Litecoin has stayed on the sidelines while the market became infatuated with Ethereum and layer 1 blockchains including Solana, Avalanche, Polkadot and whatever else is surging at the moment.  Aside from an episode in the fall of 2021 involving a fake press release and Walmart, Litecoin, despite its $6 billion market cap, just doesn’t command the same kind of attention as its decentralized finance-focused contemporaries (there is a small Litecoin DeFi community via the BoringDAO), nor does it have the institutional interest. Grayscale’s Litecoin Trust, for instance, only has assets under management of $136 million, compared to the $14.65 billion in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), and trades at a 55% discount compared to GBTC’s 42%.  Despite all this, over the last year, LTC is only down around 17% compared to 34% for ether and 37% for bitcoin.  Data shared by CryptoQuant contributing analyst Mohsen Saleh shows that both whales and retail investors are bullish on litecoin.  The supply distribution indicates that the assets in wallets holding fewer than 10,000 LTC decreased from August 2020 to May 2022. However, after May this cohort began increasing their holdings, and their collective bag has grown 10% since then.  Meanwhile, the cohort of wallets that hold fewer than 100,000 litecoin each now collectively holds more than 39 million LTC, showing that whales are also building up their supply.  “We have seen increased trading volume on litecoin pairs over the past year, indicating that traders may be valuing faster [peer-to-peer] transactions in a bear market,” OKX Managing Director of Financial Markets Lennex Lai told CoinDesk.  Lai pointed out that shorter transaction and processing times, when compared to bitcoin, made it a diversification play for many traders.  There’s also the halving narrative. Like Bitcoin, of which the Litecoin protocol was forked, the rewards delivered to miners are expected to decrease from 12.5 LTC to 6.5 LTC sometime in August. In turn, this reduces the supply of litecoin available as the mining process becomes less efficient. The previous halvings in August 2015 and August 2019 also pushed a bullish trend, as CoinDesk previously reported.  “It could be argued that the cryptocurrency’s price trajectory is displaying a stock-to-flow model, similar to previous halvings [where] a price rally takes place in the months leading to the halving event,” Andrey Stoychev, a project manager on Nexo’s Institutional Prime Brokerage team, told CoinDesk.  Stoychev adds that litecoin’s decade-plus existence on the market means a lot for traders, who continue to HODL through the good times and bad.  In crypto, sometimes it is slow and steady that wins the race. Even though it might not be exciting, the staying power of LTC as a store of value is the narrative that the market seems to respect.  Litecoin is trading at about $87.50, down about 3.5% over the past 24 hours.

8297577,https://newsbtc.com/?p=517678,1674777631,XRP Bulls Try To Break Consolidation At $0.4 To Conquer New Levels,"XRP bulls are trying to ride the wave along with Bitcoin to reclaim previously lost territory. The bulls are targeting new annual highs. Related Reading: XRP Whales Accumulate Massive Tokens – Is A Bull Run Coming? XRP has been trading in the green zone since the beginning of the year with a strong recovery and bullish sentiment from its investors. At press time, XRP is trading at $04.96, representing a gain of 0.78% in the last 24 hours. The token is auctioning 34% below its 2018 high of $3.40. Can XRP Sustain Its Bull Streak? XRP started the year with a spike in volatility that characterized the market and has been able to profit 11.85% in the last 30 days, pushing its market cap to $20.6 billion. In addition, the trading volume that XRP has experienced in recent days and weeks and the profitable trend of XRP shows that market makers are involved in the project. According to a recent report from NewsBTC, it’s possible to assume that XRP whales are once again buying and accumulating the token. This increase in activity in the XRP Ledger’s native token suggests that more wallets are being created with large amounts of XRP. While the perspective of many investors may be bullish, we can also find traces that lead us to consider a bearish scenario. XRP can break the trend line that touches three key levels and continue its bullish trend to find a position in the following challenge represented by $0.5. XRP Heaven or Hell Levels Despite the breach of previous target zones, there are strong signals that XRP’s bullish days may be numbered. The current market scenario, where some tokens are consolidating or forming a range price, suggests that the price action can explode in any direction. As with any pivotal moment in the market, this leaves XRP with two scenarios, which are explained in the following chart: XRP can break the trend line that touches three key levels and continue its bullish momentum to find a position in the following challenge represented by $0.5. On the daily chart above, XRP has formed a bearish divergence, which may represent a significant pullback for the token. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 42.51, approaching oversold territory, but for XRP, there needs to be a correction in the daily time frame before the price action can follow the RSI indicator. If this is confirmed, XRP could significantly retreat to the $0.36 support level. If the bulls cannot stop this hypothetical scenario, the token may also lose territory and test the $0.288 level. In short, XRP needs to find its momentum before a significant correction of the token and the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) forming bearish divergences on the daily charts.

In that case, bears may find themselves in the perfect scenario to ride down the hill to visit lower prices. If XRP’s downturn continues, it could retest $0.33, the following primary support line for the token.",NEUTRAL,BTC | XRP,BTC | ICO | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://newsbtc.com/news/ripple/xrp-consolidation-04-to-conquer-new-levels/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/8297577.jpeg
