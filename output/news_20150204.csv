42377971,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Lj0l,1423093014,CoinJar Redesigns iOS Wallet App for More Social Experience,"UPDATE (5th Feb, 0:45 GMT): CoinJar has clarified that only the iOS version of its new app is available today.  Anglo-Australian bitcoin exchange CoinJar has released a new mobile app, now called 'CoinJar Touch', saying new user-friendly features will speed up bitcoin payments and attract new users to digital currency.  CoinJar's Samuel Tate said the new app is in response to user requests for transfer in and out of bitcoin on its exchange ""on-the-go"", and to manage their payments and contacts lists with greater ease.  Users can send instantaneous payments to other CoinJar accounts by using Twitter-style user names instead of bitcoin addresses. CoinJar says it will also pay miners' fees for payments to addresses outside its own system, speeding up regular payments as well.  The system also allows for CoinJar users to make payments and transfers between fiat currency balances (AUD and GBP). They can pay anyone in bitcoin directly from a fiat currency balance, at the company's posted exchange rate and a 2% fee.  CoinJar  has offered a fixed-price bitcoin brokerage and merchant services since its foundation in Melbourne in 2013. It recently opened a new headquarters in London and began serving the UK market as well as Australian.  Focus on design  The new app has been completely redesigned from CoinJar's original offering, with a slick and responsive interface that looks more like a social network page than an electronic wallet.  The aim is to compete not only with other electronic payment systems, but with the physical wallet as well, said Tate.  ""We're trying to get as many people as possible using bitcoin through CoinJar, not just getting existing bitcoin users, so we needed to humanise payments for all the consumers who don’t have a clue what bitcoin is.""  CoinJar  paid a ""huge amount of attention"" to the design and use of the app to make sure it is easy for anyone to use, he added. There was a focus on making it fast, reliable and as easy to understand as paying with a card.  ""Any business that isn't driven by an easy and beautiful user experience will falter. In the bitcoin space especially, this is becoming a real differentiator, so wallets built with this in mind are the ones that will take the market share.""  Using the app  CoinDesk was able to road-test the app before its release, and can say payments were indeed seamless and quick, especially between CoinJar accounts but also to external parties.  Some aspects of the interface, like locating and displaying the user's own QR code for in-person payments, could probably be made more intuitive. Overall, though, the app is uncomplicated and easy to get used to.  Users of iOS devices with Apple's TouchID feature may use that to log into accounts instead of a PIN.  CoinJar Touch is now available on the iOS App Store.

42377985,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LjH7,1423092319,Breaking Down New York's Latest BitLicense Revision,"The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) released the latest version of of its BitLicense proposal today, an event that sets off another 30-day comment period before the much-anticipated regulation can be finalized.  The revised draft finds the state agency following through on a number of proposed changes it has previously announced publicly, while clarifying the intent and structure of the proposal.  Overall, the revised BitLicense displayed a willingness by the NYDFS to both respond to concerns from the digital currency and wider business community while largely leaving gray areas subject to its discretion and oversight.  Perhaps most notably, however, the revised draft included for the first time an estimation of the cost of applying for licensure, an amount priced at $5,000. The NYDFS indicates that the price is meant to offset the cost the NYDFS incurs by processing and reviewing the application, along with any relevant materials.  Licensees, the document notes, may also be required to pay extra fees for “additional applications related to the license"".  Enhanced supervision  If certain promised exemptions were granted, meeting the BitLicense requirements became potentially more onerous for digital currency startups in other ways, the draft document shows.  Licenses are now required by Section 200.4 to submit the names of any individuals “who have access to any customer funds, whether denominated in fiat currency or virtual currency”.  Startups will further need to provide identifying information for these individuals. As in earlier iterations of the proposal, key employees must disclose their name and address, as well as provide documentation related to their personal history and submit to fingerprinting.  Digital currency businesses are notably still required to submit a written plan describing any new product or service, as well as any “material changes” to existing offerings, a portion of the proposal that was widely criticized by the industry.  The section, however, includes a new stipulation that companies may first appeal to the NYDFS to determine the extent to which they need to engage the department on business initiatives.  “If a licensee has any questions about the materiality of any proposed change, the licensee may seek clarification from the department prior to making that change,” the document reads.  During periods of changing ownership, the NYDFS has also proposed new powers that would provide it the ability to determine that any “person does not or will not upon the taking of some proposed action control another person” in instances where new parties acquire stock or interest in a digital currency business.  Exemptions included  The text further includes exemptions previously announced by NYDFS superintendent Benjamin M Lawsky.  For example, the text includes an exclusion for software developers first revealed in an interview with CoinDesk, and exemptions for those using the Bitcoin protocol for non-financial means, in what amounts to a boon for the burgeoning crypto 2.0 sector of the industry.  A section was also added that detailed how the NYDFS may grant a conditional license for digital currency startups that don’t meet all the requirements put forth in the proposal.  Such licenses will be valid for two years during which time the proposal indicates they may be subject to “heightened review”. The revised version provides the NYDFS superintendent with wide-ranging powers to renew or revoke conditional licenses.  “In determining whether to issue a conditional license, renew or remove the conditional status of a conditional license, or impose or remove any specific conditions on a conditional license, the superintendent may consider any relevant factor or factors,” the proposal states.  Factors named in the report include the applicant’s business, anticipated volume, the risks the entity poses to the market and the business experience of those involved with the company, among others.  Recordkeeping clarified  The revised proposal includes additional text that strengthens the NYDFS’ oversight of digital currency businesses when it comes to record-keeping.  The framework now indicates that digital currency businesses will need to keep “a general ledger containing all asset, liability, ownership equity, income and expense accounts”, as well as identifying information for “any parties to the transaction” in addition to the names, account numbers and physical addresses of all those involved.  Oversight was reduced in some ways. For instance, Licensees now need only to preserve books, records and media materials for seven years, down from 10 in earlier editions.  Capital requirements were also relaxed in response to criticism from the digital currency ecosystem, which argued that that businesses were restricted from holding bitcoin and other digital currencies for business operations.  Section 200.8, which details the capital requirements, now states that licensees can hold all necessary capital in “the form of cash, virtual currency, or high-quality, highly liquid, investment-grade assets, in such proportions as are acceptable to the superintendent”.  Elsewhere, merchants who use virtual currency for investment purposes are now exempt from licensing requirements.  Revised definitions  The latest version of the proposal includes a number of revised definitions that aim to clarify issues raised during the lengthy review process.  The draft includes, for instance, a specific definition for an “exchange service”, defining it broadly as any business that exchanges fiat currency for virtual currency and vice versa, or virtual currencies for other virtual currencies.  Such a definition was previously provided under a section devoted to defining virtual currency business activity more broadly.  The NYDFS also updated its definition of virtual currency, a request that had been submitted by a number of high-profile figures in the ecosystem.  A definition of a gift card and how it differs from digital currency was further added in a change that would appear to be a response to the request of large e-commerce firms like Amazon and Walmart.

42377983,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LjEb,1423089021,Lead Developers Leave Overstock's Medici Project,"Overstock has confirmed that Counterparty co-founders and developers Robby Dermody and Evan Wagner are no longer working on its decentralized stock market project Medici.  The announcements come amid a shift in priorities for the high-profile crypto 2.0 project, first announced in October. At the time, Overstock indicated that it had hired Dermody and Wagner after vetting developers of notable 2.0 projects.  Overstock director of communications Judd Bagley indicated that the move coincides with a shift in Medici's development that will help the company build on a wider variety of protocols and blockchains in addition to Counterparty.  Bagley told CoinDesk:  ""We’re not limiting Medici to a single blockchain, ledger or protocol – the idea being that long-term, cryptosecurities will undoubtedly be traded on multiple exchanges, and Medici intends to be able to accommodate trading wherever efficient and qualified exchanges pop up.""  Dermody and Wagner confirmed the shift, indicating that they have since launched a new business to be announced soon. Both continue to work on their bitcoin-based asset transfer protocol Counterparty.  ""We wish the Medici team the best of luck in accomplishing their objectives, and look forward to possibly working with them in the future,"" the developers said.  The acknowledgement comes roughly one month after rumors of a project shift first surfaced online in remarks made by Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne.  Project team remains strong  Departures aside, Bagley contends that progress of the Medici project continues to be made, adding that he's been ""pleasantly surprised"" by the speed of development.  Bagley indicated that the remainder of the Medici team is still in place, with new replacements hired by Dermody and Wagner taking over as the lead developers.  Alec Wilkins remains in a CTO role, while Raj Karkara is still the project's business lead, Bagley said, though he noted Medici is looking for quality assurance engineers who are passionate about the digital currency space.  Perkins Coie  also continues providing legal assistance as Medici seeks to secure regulatory approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission.  Bagley also suggested that Byrne provides oversight when available. ""You could say Patrick Byrne remains the soul of the project,"" he quipped.  Overstock did not provide the names of Medici's new lead developers.

42377969,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Livj,1423085738,Ross Ulbricht Found Guilty of Operating Silk Road Dark Market,"Accused Silk Road mastermind Ross Ulbricht has been found guilty on all charges on the first day of jury deliberations.  Ulbricht, alleged by the US government to be the so-called Dread Pirate Roberts behind the now-defunct online black marketplace, was ruled guilty on a total of seven charges, which include narcotics trafficking on the Internet, conspiracy to commit money laundering and computer hacking.  The jury received initial instructions on 4th February, and reached a verdict after three and a half hours of deliberation.  The verdict marks the beginning of a new phase in Ulbricht’s long legal battle with the US government, which, according to courtroom reports, moved aggressively to oppose various aspects of the defense’s case in recent days.  Ulbricht’s legal team, spearheaded by lead counsel Joshua Dratel, painted him as the fall man for the real person behind the Silk Road operation.  While acknowledging that Ulbricht created Silk Road, the defense built its case that around the idea that the another Dread Pirate Roberts was responsible for the crimes with which Ulbricht was charged, suggesting at one point that Mt Gox CEO Mark Karpeles was the real force behind the Silk Road black market.  Strong response to outcome  The verdict sparked strong rebukes from Ulbricht supporters across social media channels, and reports indicate that the verdict was opposed by some of those in the court room today.    After the verdict was read in Ulbricht trial, a man in the back of the courtroom shouted “Ross is a hero.” #SilkRoadTrial      — ChristopherMMatthews (@cmatthews9) February 4, 2015    Others expressed concern about the broader development of the trial and whether or not the defense's case was unfairly derailed by government prosecutors.

42398210,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSnZ2,1423066051,New EU Legislation on VAT Could Be Bad News for Bitcoin,"Although it seems to have largely gone unnoticed, the European Union introduced new Value Added Tax (VAT) laws on 1st January this year.      As a consequence of this legislation, companies selling electronic goods or services to customers within the EU are now legally required to record the country of residence of their customers, which – according to some – spells bad news for bitcoin.      The new legislation was put in place to make sure that VAT is actually paid in countries where the products in question are consumed, as is the purpose of these kinds of taxes.      More specifically, the new VAT laws are supposed to prevent a certain form of tax evasion, where – mostly – large corporations open up an office in a VAT-friendly country in order to sell their products throughout all of the EU, while paying as little tax as possible.      But according to some tax lawyers, such as Richard Croker, head of corporate tax at London-based law firm CMS, these new VAT laws are consequently disadvantageous for anonymous (or pseudonymous) methods of payment such as bitcoin.      Speaking to CoinDesk, he said:      “Due to the inability to identify a buyer or his location, taking payments in bitcoin might be partially incompatible with these new laws. Whether it's a total drag on the market I don't know, but it's certainly a disincentive for companies to accept bitcoin.”            Proof of residence    In order to establish the country of residence for customers, companies both within and outside of the EU are required to collect two independent pieces of evidence that prove what their customer's country of residence is.      As a guideline, the European Commission has formulated nine options that would suffice (see the full explanatory notes here). Particularly relevant for bitcoin is the third option on that list, which entails “bank details such as the place where the bank account used for payment is and the billing address of the customer held by that bank”.      This might indeed seem like bad news for bitcoin and bitcoin users for obvious reasons, but not everybody sees it that way.      Prominent Dutch IT lawyer Arnoud Engelfriet of Legal ICT believes a customer's ability to pay with bitcoin should be no more than a minor issue.      Engelfriet said:      “Note that the nine options are not the only ways in which companies can prove where someone's country of residence is. They can use any two independent methods of proof.”              Excluding bitcoin, that would still leave more than enough options to play by the rules, according to Engelfriet.      “It is not necessary under the VAT rules to identify the consumer by name and address,"" he said. ""You only have to identify the country of residence. If customers wish to pay with bitcoin, merchants could simply use the invoice address and the IP address, for example.”      Vanessa Mock, a European Commission spokesperson, acknowledged that the new rules are not meant to impede on buyers' potential desire to pay anonymously.    ""All a company needs to establish is the country of residence of their customers. This can be done in a number of ways that don't include a buyers' identity. After a customers' country of residence has been established, using a potentially anonymous method of payment like bitcoin shouldn't pose a problem"", she told CoinDesk.    What exactly counts as evidence to prove the customers' country of residence is determined by the individual member states of the EU.

42398221,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSnjr,1423062397,HashRabbit Raises $500k for its Bitcoin Mining Software Solution,"HashRabbit, a startup that supplies enterprise-focused software to facilitate the management and security of bitcoin miners, has raised $500,000.  The funding comes from Tim Draper’s Draper Associates along with VegasTechFund, an investment firm run by Zappos founder Tony Hsieh. Alongside the funding announcement, HashRabbit is making its software suite available to all bitcoin miners.  The company also has announced a partnership with mining hardware manufacturer Spondoolies-Tech, whose gear is compatible with HashRabbit's management software.  Chris Shepherd, co-founder and CEO of HashRabbit, told CoinDesk:  “We make software for bitcoin miners. What that means is we are essentially the firmware that actually runs on the bitcoin miner itself.”  Benefits of experience  Shepherd explained the idea for HashRabbit came from running his own mining rig in a Las Vegas garage during the winter of 2013. During this time, Shepherd kept having problems keeping his mining equipment operational, which resulted in lost revenue opportunities.  Shepherd said:  “Every minute, every second this thing is not hashing, not getting credit, you’re losing money.”  To figure out how to better manage his mining rig, Shepherd recruited his roommate, Gabe Evans, a developer and sometimes white-hat hacker.  Evans realized the code that was being run on most mining gear at that time was not terribly good. Eventually, he became the technical co-founder of HashRabbit.  A product user experience designer, Melissa Volkmann, who advocates for consensus on the bitcoin symbol, currently rounds out the team.  With an early product prototype of its mining management software, HashRabbit became part of 'Tribe 4' at Boost VC, the bitcoin startup accelerator.  Fixing security flaws  During its time at Boost's San Mateo, California, incubator, the company discovered that security was a huge issue in the bitcoin mining market. The team found several flaws that existed in many bitcoin miners on the market that critically needed to be fixed.  However, they also discovered there was no easy way to patch a miner, even when a solution to a flaw was found. That's when HashRabbit realized its existing management software would be able to help send updates when a security patch was required.  Shepherd said:  “We realized that firmware is the problem, and we needed to make a better system that allows for updates when zero days come out.”  By working directly with hardware manufacturers on security issues, HashRabbit has gained credibility with companies such as Israel-based mining manufacturer Spondoolies-Tech.  “[Spondoolies-Tech] is focused on hardware, and we can focus on the software and make sure it is consistently secure, fast and easily updated,” Shepherd noted.  Shepherd indicated that HashRabbit is also working with other hardware manufacturers, but could not provide details at this stage.  The enterprise mining era  The dawn of ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) in 2013 ushered in a new marketplace for consumers to purchase bitcoin miners. However, the industry has increasingly shifted from small home-based set-ups to serious enterprise operations based in the datacenter.  This is beneficial for HashRabbit, as many of these mining operations are labor-intensive – something the startup has a solution for with its product.  Shepherd added:  “There are a lot of mining operations right now that have a lot of manpower, using a lot of people. For example, when a mining rig goes down or overheats, they have someone go and manually fix it.”  With HashRabbit’s software, not only can miners expedite the process of making sure firmware is updated, it can also enable operators to power cycle and control each unit from one source.  Going forward, the company hinted it may expand its product to enable more advanced cloud mining capabilities.
