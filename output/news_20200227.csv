42383372,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vOJb,1582842535,"Coronavirus Hits US Stocks, Bitcoin Climbs, Haven Status Unclear","The spreading coronavirus sowed a new bout of fear among investors, triggering a stock market sell-off and flight to safe-haven assets like gold and U.S. Treasury bonds, with 47 countries now reporting infections amid widespread reports of travel cancellations, shipment delays and business interruptions.      U.S. stocks fell for the sixth straight day, Treasury yields slid to a record low and gold prices were little changed close to a seven-year high. Bitcoin’s price climbed 1.4 percent to $8,902, rising along with popular cryptocurrencies including ether.      Analysts for the Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs warned Thursday in a report that the virus could disrupt factories’ supply chains, damp demand for exports and ultimately stunt economic output in China, the U.S. and elsewhere. The firm warned the impact of the contagion could wipe out any growth in the combined profits of companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index.      “We have updated our earnings model to incorporate the likelihood that the virus becomes widespread,” the Goldman analysts led by Chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin wrote.      Bank of America analysts wrote Thursday the coronavirus had “gripped global markets.” Prevailing interest rates, already at or close to historic lows and set at negative levels in Europe and Japan, are not expected to rise “until Chinese economic activity improves and there are signs of global containment.”      “While most U.S. investors have been waiting for a reversal-of-the-virus bump in the rates market, the situation has gotten worse,” the analysts wrote. “We see U.S. Treasurys as clearly the optimal choice of perceived safe-haven protection.”      U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted on Wednesday that “fake news” media outlets were “doing everything possible to make the caronavirus (sic) look as bad as possible, including panicking markets.” But as the U.S. economy faces a new risk that could hurt his reelection chances in November, Trump put Vice President Mike Pence in charge of coordinating the U.S. government’s response to the public health concerns.      Trump wanted governors and members of Congress to have a single point person to communicate with, “eliminating any jockeying for power in a decentralized situation,” the New York Times reported, citing unnamed White House aides.      This week’s sell-off in the S&P 500, which tracks large U.S. stocks, left the index down 7 percent so far in 2020.      The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note declined by 0.02 percentage point to 1.29 percent, a record low.      Gold futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange were little changed Thursday, close to the seven-year high of $1,662 an ounce reached earlier in the week.      Bitcoin fell earlier this week as the coronavirus fears started to hit traditional markets, leading some analysts to question the thesis that the 11-year-old cryptocurrency might serve as a safe haven from financial panic, similar to the way many investors view gold. Prices for bitcoin fell to $8,627 on Wednesday, the lowest in a month. The digital asset was born in the throes of the last global financial crisis, more than a decade ago.      But some optimism returned to the market on Thursday, with the cryptocurrency's price rebound leaving prices up 24 percent on the year.      The billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya, who serves as chairman of the spaceflight company Virgin Galactic, told CNBC on Wednesday that bitcoin appears “completely uncorrelated” with other asset categories like stocks, bonds and emerging markets.      That dynamic should push investors to put 1 percent of assets into bitcoin, though they should accumulate the positions gradually, he said.      “When you wake up and see a coronavirus scare and the Dow down 2,000 [points], you should not be going in and buying bitcoin,” he said. “That is an idiotic strategy.”",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/27/coronavirus-hits-us-stocks-bitcoin-climbs-haven-status-unclear,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/403d58abb84feb400533b75a6c3623ca0e1cfd8d-1920x1368.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383391,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vOgF,1582834550,Ether Futures Volume on FTX Hit Record Highs,"Antigua-based crypto derivatives exchange FTX saw record volumes in ether (ETH) futures on Wednesday amid a sell-off in the cryptocurrency’s price.      Daily trading volume on the nine-month-old exchange jumped to a lifetime high of $245 million, marking a 51 percent increase from Tuesday’s volume of $162 million, according to Skew Markets. The previous record high of $189 million was reached on Feb. 20.      While volumes on FTX spiked, the cryptocurrency’s price fell by 10 percent from $251 to $215 to hit the lowest level since Feb. 8.      Trading activity has been rising since early January and has witnessed spectacular growth over the last four weeks, as seen below.      Throughout the second half of 2019, futures registered daily volume of more than $25 million only seven times. The situation changed in mid-January with the futures witnessing a daily volume of more than $45 million for three consecutive days.      Daily volume rose from $12 million on Jan. 27 to $245 million on Feb. 26, a staggering 1,784 percent increase.      Volume growth has been accompanied by a sharp rise in the open interest.      Open interest, or the number of futures contracts outstanding on the exchange, rose from $8.4 million to a record high of $81 million in the five weeks to Feb. 20. Open positions stood at $72 million on Wednesday.      Activity on FTX seems to have been boosted by ether’s solid price rally.      The second-largest cryptocurrency by market value traded near $125 in early January and rose to a seven-month high of $289 on Feb. 19, according to CoinDesk’s Ether Price Index. At press time, ether was trading at $228, representing a 77 percent gain on a year-to-date basis.      Other exchanges are also reporting a solid growth in the ether futures trading volumes. BitMEX, one of the largest derivatives exchanges, traded $1.4 billion volume on Feb. 13, the highest since July 15, 2019, according to Skew Markets.      Total daily volumes across nine exchanges rose to $5.2 billion on Wednesday, the highest since May 2019.       Daily volumes have topped $5 billion four times so far this month.      FTX accounted for 4.7 percent of the total volume of $5.2 billion registered on Wednesday. Meanwhile, BitMEX contributed 18 percent of the total volume.      While FTX remains an underdog, it is slowly eating into BitMEX’s trading volume, as noted by trader John Dummet.      Total derivative volume traded by FTX as a percentage of BitMEX volume recently rose above 40 percent, marking a big rise from 10 percent noted at the start of the year.      It remains to be seen whether FTX is able to keep the momentum going.

Sood’s esports platform is partnering with horse racing game ZED RUN to bring horse betting to the ethereum blockchain. The game relies on the non-fungible token (NFT) standard first made famous by Dapper Labs’ CryptoKitties.      The horses are purchasable on ZED and tradeable on Unikrn’s platform with each piece of data tracked via ethereum’s ERC-721 standard. Only 38,000 horses will ever be created on ZED – although users can breed horses from their own stables.      In fact, one ZED stallion sold for 50 ether, according to Sood, worth about $11,000 depending on market conditions.      The first race is set to debut in two or three weeks, Sood said.    Place your bets    Gambling is hardly new to blockchains. Tron, popular in Asian speculation circles, facilitated $1.6 billion in dapp volume in Q1 2019 with 64 percent of applications attributed to gambling (including a now-defunct dog-racing dapp). According to DappRadar, casino games dominate the gambling dapp sector in terms of usage.       Traditional horse racing is dominated by an older crowd who share a love for the track but have poor gambling platforms, Sood said. Unikrn thinks it can combine two audiences – esports fans and horse bettors – onto one platform.      For context, one billion hours of esports were streamed on Twitch in January 2020 alone with some four million viewers, according to TwitchTracker.      “You can own a horse,” Sood said. “Your horse can win prizes and your horse can gain notoriety. … We’re catering to a very broad audience, not just young people.”      Unikrn launched crypto betting on Twitch streams in May 2019 for popular games such as Fortnite. Sood said Unikrn has four million users across its various products with an average of 160,000 gamblers who can use either crypto or cash.      The near on-demand nature of virtual horse racing and the plethora of locations at which an event can occur are digital features that best traditional racing, Sood said. The Las Vegas Strip or Sydney Harbour Bridge were two examples of possible race tracks Sood gave. Plus, typical tracks can only support a handful of horses while Unikrn can support dozens of horses at once.    Legal questions    As of now, players can bet on themselves in 41 U.S. states, although competitive betting is still in the works pending partnerships with local casinos. Unikrn is also available for betting in 43 countries around the globe.      “In the U.S., betting on sports is regulated state by state. In order to get a license, you have to own a land-based casino or be partnered with them,” Sood said.      For self-bets, Unikrn tracks user information such as past races to create custom betting odds against the house itself, Unikrn. Bets can be placed in USD or UnikoinGold (UKG), the platform’s native ERC-20 token. Other cryptos can be deposited on the platform and converted back-and-forth to UKG as well, Sood said.

42383389,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vOdj,1582824175,The DeFi 'Flash Loan' Attack That Changed Everything,"Haseeb Qureshi is a managing partner at Dragonfly Capital, a cross-border crypto venture fund. A longer version of the article appears on Medium.      Flash loans have been the center of attention lately. Recently, two hackers used flash loans to attack the margin trading protocol bZx, first in a $350,000 attack and later in a $600,000 copycat attack.      These attacks were, in a word, magnificent. In each attack, a penniless attacker instantaneously borrowed hundreds of thousands of dollars of ETH, threaded it through a chain of vulnerable on-chain protocols, extracted hundreds of thousands of dollars in stolen assets, and then paid back their massive ETH loans. All of this happened in an instant — that is, in a single ethereum transaction.      We don’t know who these attackers were or where they came from. Both started with basically nothing and walked away with hundreds of thousands of dollars in value. Neither left any traces to identify themselves.      In the wake of these attacks, I’ve been thinking a lot about flash loans and their implications for the security of DeFi. I think this is worth thinking through in public.      In short: I believe flash loans are a big security threat. But flash loans are not going away, and we need to think carefully about the impact they will have for DeFi security going forward.    What is a flash loan?    The concept of a flash loan was first termed by Marble Protocol in 2018. Marble marketed itself as a “smart contract bank,” and its product was a simple yet brilliant DeFi innovation: zero-risk loans via a smart contract.      How can a loan have zero risk?      Traditional lenders take on two forms of risk. The first is default risk: If the borrower runs off with the money, that obviously sucks. But the second risk to a lender is illiquidity risk: If a lender lends out too many of its assets at the wrong times or doesn’t receive timely repayments, the lender may be unexpectedly illiquid and not be able to meet its own obligations.      Flash loans mitigate both risks. A flash loan basically works like this: I will lend you as much money as you want for this single transaction. But by the end of this transaction you must pay me at least as much as I lent you. If you are unable to do that, I will automatically roll back your transaction! (Yep, smart contracts can do that.)      Simply put, your flash loan is atomic. If you fail to pay back the loan, the whole thing gets reverted as though the loan never happened.      Something like this could only exist on blockchains. You could not do flash loans on, say, BitMEX. This is because smart-contract platforms process transactions one at a time, so everything that happens in a transaction is executed serially as a batch operation. You can think of this as your transaction “freezing time” while it’s executing. A centralized exchange, on the other hand, can have race conditions such that a leg of your order fails to fill. On the blockchain, you’re guaranteed that all of your code runs one line after the next.      So let’s think about the economics here for a second. Traditional lenders are compensated for two things: the risk they’re taking on (default risk and illiquidity risk), and for the opportunity cost of the capital they’re lending out (e.g., if I can get 2 percent interest elsewhere on that capital, the borrower must pay me more than the risk-free 2 percent).      Flash loans are different. Flash loans have no risk and no opportunity cost! This is because the borrower “froze time” for the duration of their flash loan, so in anyone else’s eyes, the system’s capital was never at risk and never encumbered, therefore it could not have earned interest elsewhere (i.e., it did not have an opportunity cost).      This means, in a sense, there’s no cost to being a flash lender. This is deeply counterintuitive. So how much should a flash loan cost at equilibrium (i.e. when market demand and supply balances)?      Basically, flash loans should be free. Or, more properly, there should be a small enough fee to amortize the cost of including three extra lines of code to make an asset flash-lendable.      Flash loans cannot charge interest in the traditional sense, because the loan is active for zero time (any APR * 0 = 0). And of course, if flash lenders charged higher rates, they’d quickly be outcompeted by other flash lending pools that charged lower rates.      Flash lending makes capital a true commodity. This race to the bottom inevitably results in zero fees or a tiny nominal fee. dYdX [trading platform] currently charges zero fees for flash lending. AAVE, on the other hand, charges 0.09 percent on the principal for flash loans. I suspect this is not sustainable and, indeed, their community has called for slashing fees to zero. (Note that neither of the attacks we saw used AAVE as their flash lending pool.)    Flash attacks have big security implications    I’ve increasingly come to believe what flash loans really unlock are flash attacks — capital-intensive attacks funded by flash loans. We saw the first glimpses of this in the recent bZx hacks, and I suspect that’s only the the tip of the spear.      There are two main reasons why flash loans are especially attractive to attackers.      1. Many attacks require lots of up-front capital (such as oracle manipulation attacks). If you’re earning a positive ROI on $10 million of ETH, it’s probably not arbitrage — you’re likely up to some nonsense.      2. Flash loans minimize taint for attackers. If I have an idea of how to manipulate an oracle with $10 million of ether, even if I own that much ether, I might not want to risk it with my own capital. My ETH will get tainted, exchanges might reject my deposits, and it will be hard to launder. It’s risky! But if I take out a flash loan for $10 million, then who cares? It’s all upside. It’s not like the collateral pool of dYdX will be considered tainted because that’s where my loan came from — the taint on dYdX just sort of evaporates.      You might not like that exchange blacklisting is part of the blockchain security model today. It’s quite squishy and centralized. But it’s an important reality that informs the calculus behind these attacks.      In the bitcoin white paper, Satoshi famously claimed that bitcoin (BTC) is secure from attack because:      “[The attacker] ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules […] than to undermine the system and validity of his own wealth.”      With flash loans, attackers no longer need to have any skin in the game. Flash loans materially change the risks for an attacker.      And remember, flash loans can stack! Subject to the gas limit, you could literally aggregate every flash loanable pool in a single transaction (upwards of $50 million) and bring all that capital thundering down onto a single vulnerable contract. It’s a $50 million battering ram that now anyone can slam into any on-chain pinata, so long as money comes out. This is scary.    What does all of this mean for the long term?    I believe the bZx attacks changed things.      This will not be the last flash attack. The second bZx attack was the first copycat, and I suspect it will set off a wave of attacks in the coming months. Now, thousands of clever teenagers from the remotest parts of the world are poking at all these DeFi legos, examining them under a microscope, trying to discover if there is some way they can pull off a flash attack. If they manage to exploit a vulnerability, they too could make a few hundred thousand dollars — a life-changing sum in most parts of the world.      To protocols, flash attacks mean the threat model is now changed. Being hit by a flash attack after the bZx hacks will be as embarrassing as getting hit by re-entrancy after the DAO hack: you will be the laughingstock of crypto. You should’ve seen it coming.      Lastly, these episodes have gotten me thinking about an old concept in crypto: miner-extractable value (MEV). MEV is the total value that miners can extract from a blockchain system. This includes block rewards and fees, but it also includes more mischievous forms of value extraction, such as reordering transactions or inserting rogue transactions into a block.      At bottom, you should think of all of these flash attacks as single transactions in the mempool that make tons of money. For example, the second bZx attack resulted in $645,000 profit in ETH in a single transaction. If you’re a miner and you’re about to start mining a new block, imagine looking at the previous block’s transactions and saying to yourself… “wait, what? Why am I about to try to mine a new block for ~$500, when that last block contains $645K of profit in it??”    We’re still far from having sustainable architecture for building the financial system of the future.    Instead of extending the chain, it’d be in your interest to go back and try to rewrite history such that you were the flash attacker instead. Think about it: that transaction alone was worth more than four hours worth of honestly mined ethereum blocks!      This is similar to having a special super-block that contains 1,000 times the normal block reward — just as you expect, the rational result of such a super-block should be a dogpile of miners competing to orphan the tip of the chain and steal that block for themselves.      At equilibrium, all flash attacks should ultimately be extracted by miners. (Note that they should also end up stealing all on-chain arbitrage and liquidations.) This will, ironically, serve as a deterrent against flash attacks, since it will leave attackers unable to monetize their discoveries of these vulnerabilities. Perhaps eventually miners will start soliciting attack code through private channels and pay the would-be attacker a finder’s fee. Technically, this could be done trust-lessly using zero-knowledge proofs. (Weird to think about, right?)      But that’s all pretty sci-fi for now. Miners obviously aren’t doing this today.      Why aren’t they?      Tons of reasons. It’s hard, it’s a lot of work, the Ethereum Virtual Machine sucks to simulate, it’s risky, there would be bugs that would result in lost funds or orphaned blocks, it’d cause an uproar and the rogue mining pool might have a PR crisis and be branded an “enemy of ethereum.” For now miners would probably lose more in business and orphaned blocks than they’d gain by trying to do this.      That’s true today. It won’t be true for long.      This lends yet another motivation for ethereum to hurry up and transition to Ethereum 2.0. DeFi on ethereum, while amazing and mesmerizing, is absolutely and irrevocably broken. DeFi is not stable on a PoW chain, because all high-value transactions are subject to miner reappropriation (also known as time bandit attacks).      For these systems to work at scale, you need finality — the inability for miners to rewrite confirmed blocks. This will protect previous blocks from getting reappropriated. Plus if DeFi protocols exist on separate Ethereum 2.0 shards, they won’t be vulnerable to flash attacks.      In my estimation, flash attacks give us a small but useful reminder that it’s early days. We’re still far from having sustainable architecture for building the financial system of the future.      For now, flash loans will be the new normal. Maybe in the long run, all assets on ethereum will be available for flash loans. All of the collateral held by exchanges, by Uniswap, maybe all ERC-20s themselves.

42404079,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhIj6,1582823060,Dusk Network Plans to Tokenize Equity for Thousands of Dutch Companies,"Security token platform Dusk Network says it will tokenize shares for thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the Netherlands and the broader Benelux region.      The Amsterdam-based company announced Thursday it has partnered with Firm24, one of the region's largest shareholder registries, and will use blockchain for an automated infrastructure that could introduce market efficiencies and transform how shares, that are not publicly listed, are traded.      Blockchain infrastructure provider LTO Network will also provide an interface between Dusk and Firm24 to link off-chain activities to the blockchain system and manage procedures that require approval from a notary.      Dusk Network's business lead and director, Jelle Pol, told CoinDesk there were clear advantages in moving shareholder registries and operations onto a distributed ledger. For example, tokenization creates a new secondary market for investors to trade shares and having all the information in one place makes it easier for companies to monitor who owns their shares.      ""Across the board, we're definitely seeing these efficiency gains and especially also on the corporate side, the amount of data that they're able to leverage additionally just opens up more custom-tailored services,"" Pol explained.      Shareholder registries are essentially records of all the individuals and entities that own shares in a particular company and are supposed to be updated on an ongoing basis. However, that can be a laborious process, and in the EU notaries were required to sign off whenever share ownership records changed.      Although the process has significantly improved in recent years, with notaries placed in a more supervisory position, there are still recurring problems in keeping track of who owns company equity. For smaller companies that aren't publicly listed, paying out dividends and organizing shareholder votes can be next to impossible.      This is a problem that Firm24, which has more than 35,000 SMEs from Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg (known as the Benelux region), hopes to address with the new partnership.      As many smaller companies aren't publicly listed on exchanges, trades that take place in the secondary market happen privately. Cap table management breaks down because no one, not even the issuer, is made aware these trades have taken place. Even when they are recorded, they usually use a different notary which makes it hard to create and maintain a single source of truth.      “For almost a decade we have been bringing automation to everything related to the company incorporation procedure,"" said Firm24 CEO Martijn Migchelsen. ""Thanks to Dusk and LTO we are now ready to deploy our Tokenized Share Register, automating corporate actions, and lay the foundation to connect our customers directly with the world of alternative finance.”      Pol said that in initial discussions with Firm24 they had initially envisaged Dusk as an ""administrative mirror."" But as they started ""playing around with it,"" other potential use cases arose. As well as cap table management, the firms also realized they could create tokenized representatives of share certificates that could be freely tradable on the platform.      Tokenization – either a representative of paper equity or a fully digitalized security – creates significant cost and time efficiencies, Pol said. Dusk estimates SMEs can save anywhere between 20-30 percent on costs associated with the production and distribution of documentation and proposals. In the case of dividend payouts, blockchain technology can take costs down by as much as 90 percent.      Dusk could tokenize stock for public companies, but Pol suggested SMEs had the most to gain from using blockchain technology. One of the key challenges brought up by SMEs is the difficulty in accessing new capital. Tokenization, Pol said, can broaden the investor pool, allowing companies to raise funds from retail investors and institutions outside of their immediate network.      A Dusk spokesperson said the company expects the new Firm24 platform to go live in Q2 2020. After that it plans to tokenize as many as 10,000 newly incorporated companies by the year's end, as well as start work on tokenizing an estimated 25,000 companies that are already incorporated. Registered firms are able to opt out of the scheme if they choose.

42404085,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhIn2,1582817104,Startup Tokenizes $2.2B in Commercial Real Estate Through Polymath,"Commercial real estate marketplace Red Swan has tokenized $2.2 billion in real estate through security token platform Polymath.      According to Red Swan CEO Ed Nwokedi, $780 million of that is available to investors in pre-sale, while the company has another $4 billion in real estate in its tokenization pipeline. The $2.2 billion represents 16 different Class A commercial properties based in Austin and Houston, Texas, Brooklyn, N.Y., Oakland, Calif., and Ontario, Canada.      Tokenization has struggled to transform the multitrillion-dollar real estate market as institutions hesitate to re-engineer back offices until they see liquidity. Graeme Moore, head of tokenization at Polymath, believes this project will work where others failed.      “I think what kind of happened in the past was there were platforms like Harbor, Propellr and Fluidity, which were really tech companies,” Moore said. “They didn’t really have the real estate background or the expertise to understand how the private real estate market works.”      (Harbor’s flagship project reportedly crumbled over paperwork issues. The startup was acquired by crypto custodian BitGo earlier this month. The Fluidity and Propellr project was quietly shelved last summer.)      New York City-based Red Swan is holding investors’ funds in escrow and plans to distribute shares in April. Meanwhile, Nwokedi said Red Swan is in the middle of becoming a registered investment adviser with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which will allow it to manage assets for accredited investors.      The tokens are ST-20 tokens running on Ethereum, but Red Swan plans to switch over to an Enterprise blockchain platform in the future for increased speed and security, Nwokedi said. Polymath only provides the tokenization technology while Red Swan appraises, markets and sells the deals.      Nwokedi, an 18-year veteran in the real estate space, turned to tokenization because he was looking for a way to open up high-quality real estate investment, usually only available for institutions and high-net-worth individuals, to accredited investors. Red Swan claims it has 30,000 accredited investors in its network.      “You have a very large segment of investors who are between half a million and $10 million that were not participating because they just don’t have enough equity to buy a quality piece of real estate,” said Nwokedi. “So they’re focused on more risky, lower class-level projects.”      Nwokedi also hopes to help property owners who are property rich and cash poor by allowing them to pull more equity out of their properties without having to go to the bank. While banks will usually only allow roughly 50 percent leverage on a given asset, Red Swan allows property owners to tokenize 90 percent of the net equity underlying a property.      Red Swan makes money by taking a percentage of the equity that’s issued, and tokens sit within a digital wallet custodied by Prime Trust and are insured up to $1 billion.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/02/27/startup-tokenizes-22b-in-commercial-real-estate-through-polymath,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8fff054e09b21716b6c8748265167a3cf8741c27-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404073,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhIbE,1582815608,Binance Throws Weight Behind Shyft Network in 'Travel Rule' Standards Race,"Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange group, has chosen the Shyft Network to help address a looming regulatory requirement that firms must share users’ personal data when handling digital asset transactions.      Barbados-based Shyft Network is one of an array of potential solutions to the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) “Travel Rule.” The name comes from the stipulation that personally identifiable information must travel with a transaction (no mean feat considering crypto transactions are pseudonymous by design.)      “Shyft stands out because they are extremely acute, and very well connected with global regulators,” said Samuel Lim, Binance’s head of compliance. “These things we consider to be very important. Of course, the underlying technology stack is core, too.”      Getting the public endorsement of Binance is a big deal for the Shyft Network, a SWIFT-like infrastructure incorporating ethereum technology. The firm hired former FATF executive secretary Rick McDonell as an adviser last October.      “We have been working with a lot of the big exchanges for the last nine months,” said Shyft Network co-founder Joseph Weinberg. “Binance is the first to publicly come out, but more will definitely be on the way.”      The FATF, a global anti-money laundering watchdog that sets rules for the G-20 group of countries, will review progress on addressing the travel rule for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) in June of this year.      But it’s still early days as far as the industry is concerned. Binance said it has been in talks with “a good four or five” candidate solutions. “Shyft is not the only solution we are endorsing but it’s the first that we are putting our brand behind. Things could change in the future but as of now, the focus is on Shyft,” said Lim.      There are a number of moving parts when it comes to meeting travel rule requirements, including creating an identity system across a universe of VASPs, the storing and sharing of personally identifiable information (PII) without compromising privacy, and agreeing on a standardized messaging or data transmission system.    Interoperability first    Whatever solutions the industry adopts, interoperability between them is a must.      “If a European solution does not fit with an Asian solution, then both of them are wrong,” said Lim.      “Maybe at the start these solutions are trying to differentiate themselves and perhaps there is sort of a competing factor, or competitive advantage. But down the road, when they get big enough, they will not have much of a choice other than to be working with others to satisfy the information transfer and relay requirements,” he said.      The Shyft Network comprises three layers, explained Weinberg. The network itself is a blockchain built from a modified version of the ethereum codebase. A second layer is a smart-contract infrastructure which determines how counterparties are identified and rules about how they share data. The layer on top is where the actual data transmission happens.      Weinberg said the lower layers of the system are interoperable with other travel solution providers, mentioning CipherTrace, an advocate of certificate authorities to identify VASPs; Netki, which favors a decentralized approach; and OpenVASP of Switzerland, which also uses elements of ethereum technology.      “We have been working with OpenVASP on interoperability already,” Weinberg said. “Because the Shyft blockchain is a forked version of ethereum, you can actually deploy all of OpenVASP's smart contracts fully onto Shyft.”      Some players believe a decentralized blockchain-based approach is needed to solve the travel rule problem in a manner appropriate to crypto companies, while others would prefer to rely on more centralized systems.      Lim of Binance was decidedly agnostic about the choice of tech.      “We are not really concerned if this runs on ERC-20, on Ripple, or on Binance Chain. It doesn't really matter. We need a cat that catches the mice. That’s the solution for us,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | BNB,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/02/27/binance-throws-weight-behind-shyft-network-in-travel-rule-standards-race,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1c33a32cfecc999679bb76517b521a6050861050-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said in a statement on Thursday that Seagal did not disclose payments received in return for promoting the token launched by Bitcoiin2Gen (B2G) in February of that year.      The SEC said Seagal had not disclosed he was offered $250,000 in cash and $750,000 worth of B2G tokens in exchange for his services in promoting the ICO. These had included social media posts calling on his followers and fans not to ""miss out"" on the token investment, according to the SEC order. He also issued a press release titled, ""Zen Master Steven Seagal Has Become the Brand Ambassador of Bitcoiin2Gen.""      Seagal was further quoted in a B2G press release saying he backed the ICO ""wholeheartedly.""      ""These investors were entitled to know about payments Seagal received or was promised to endorse this investment so they could decide whether he may be biased,"" said Kristina Littman, chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s Cyber Unit. ""Celebrities are not allowed to use their social media influence to tout securities without appropriately disclosing their compensation.""      Even at its launch, B2G had been compelled to issue a statement refuting accusations it was a pyramid scheme over its marketing practices. A month later, the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance warned the state's residents about the token project.      The SEC has previously advised celebrity endorsements of a token may be illegal if it is deemed a security. Promoters ""must disclose the nature, scope, and amount of compensation received in exchange for the promotion,"" the regulator says in today's announcement.      The SEC orders states Seagal broke the anti-touting provisions of federal securities laws and has agreed to pay $157,000 in disgorgement without admitting or denying any wrongdoing.      The disgorgement covers the actor's promotional payments, with prejudgment interest and a penalty of $157,000, according to the SEC. He's also agreed not to promote any security for three years.      The SEC said the investigation is continuing.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TOKEN SALE,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/02/27/steven-seagal-settles-token-touting-charges-with-sec-over-2018-ico,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e7d45f9e0092b05d33b2b65acb190d0764f9cfac-1500x966.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) announced Wednesday it has invested $715,000 worth of lumens (XLM) tokens in DSTOQ, a security token platform that provides traders with access to global markets from their smartphones.      The foundation's CEO and executive director, Denelle Dixon, said DSTOQ's goals clearly aligned with Stellar's aim to make financial services more accessible. ""It deeply resonates with our mission, which is creating equitable access to the global financial system,"" she said in a Twitter video post.      This is the first investment SDF has made from its enterprise fund, which was created in September to support projects that contribute to the broader Stellar ecosystem. DSTOQ, which is domiciled in Liechtenstein, already leverages the Stellar protocol to create security tokens that users can buy and sell peer-to-peer.      In a statement, DSTOQ CEO and co-founder Craig Mc Gregor described the SDF investment as a ""vote of confidence"" for its vision to use blockchain technology to develop new financial products as well as to improve accessibility into global markets.      Built on the blockchain, DSTOQ says it can tokenize blue-chip stocks, like Apple or Google shares, and make them available to investors irrespective of where they are in the world. The company opted to use Stellar in October 2018, saying its consensus algorithm made the protocol secure against 51 percent attacks.      DSTOQ says that it plans to use the SDF investment to develop new technology and help fund the platform's expansion into the Vietnamese and South African markets.

42404074,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhIcD,1582807669,World's Top Crypto Miners Race to Roll Out Top-of-Line Machines Ahead of Bitcoin Halving,"Two of the largest bitcoin mining equipment manufacturers are in a neck-and-neck race to roll out top-of-the-line machines ahead of bitcoin's (BTC) halving event in less than three months.      On Thursday, Beijing-based mining giant Bitmain launched its latest AntMiner S19 and S19 Pro models, boasting computing power as high as 110 terahashes per second (TH/s) and an energy cost of 29.5 watts per terahash (W/T).      Going by the firm's specifications, the two models would currently be the most profitable bitcoin mining devices if available, closely followed by the WhatsMiner M30S from Bitmain's Shenzhen-based rival, MicroBT, according to a miner profitability index from f2pool.      The launch comes on the back of a heated battle between Bitmain and MicroBT, which has gained a significant share of the mining equipment business after selling about 600,000 units of its M20 series in 2019, chipping away at Bitmain's long-time market dominance.      MicroBT, which launched its flagship M30 models in December, has started taking pre-orders for the latest and most powerful product line since last week, with deliveries of sample units starting as early as next month.      According to MicroBT's major distributor Pangolin Miner, the M30S – priced at $2,430 apiece – touts a computing power of 86 TH/s with an energy cost of 38 W/T and uses 8-nanometer chips supplied by Samsung. The firm said some devices will ship from March to May, but large pre-orders would have to wait until as late as June.      On the other hand, prices and the pre-order/delivery dates for Bitmain's S19 models have not yet been announced. Adding to the uncertainty is whether Bitmain can deliver production on a large scale, since the latest models adopt 7-nm chips that come in limited supplies from its vendor, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.      It also remains to be seen how the industry will react to the releases of top-notch but more expensive mining equipment, as bitcoin's price has retracted from its recent growth momentum above $10,000.      Currently, Bitmain's older model the AntMiner S9 is still one of the most widely used miners, generating a daily gross margin of about 30 percent at bitcoin's current price, based on f2pool's index.      Further, the coronavirus outbreak in China has affected the country's manufacturing and logistics businesses, causing delays for those that were looking to expand or upgrade existing mining facilities.      In fact, data from mining pool BTC.com shows bitcoin's mining difficulty – a measure of how hard it is to compete for mining rewards – has stagnated for a month and is currently around the same level seen on Jan. 28.      But with bitcoin's halving event approaching in May, a programmed-in change that will reduce the network's mining rewards from 12.5 BTC per block to 6.25, older models like the S9 will become unprofitable unless bitcoin's price increases significantly. As such, miners may have to either upgrade or get out of the industry.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/02/27/worlds-top-crypto-miners-race-to-roll-out-top-of-line-machines-ahead-of-bitcoin-halving,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e601e4f844442414ff7194d2be8b4a638cc54077-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404091,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhItv,1582802413,Bitcoin Sees Corrective Price Bounce After Hitting One-Month Lows,"View  Bitcoin has made a recovery after falling to a recent low near $8,500 overnight.  Short duration charts are calling for an extension of an ongoing corrective bounce to $9,000.  A move above key resistance at $9,430 is needed to weaken bearish pressure.    Bitcoin (BTC) has bounced from one-month lows hit early on Thursday and may extend the recovery to $9,000.      The cryptocurrency is currently trading at $8,800, having hit a low of $8,520 at 01:15 UTC this morning – a level last seen on Jan. 26, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.      Back then, bitcoin was starting a rally toward a multi-month high of $10,500 on Feb. 13. Now, however, the picture has become more bleak.      Bitcoin lost its upward trajectory on Feb. 19 when prices fell by 5.8 percent, violating the bullish trendline rising from Jan.3 and Jan. 26 lows. The downside move gathered pace after bull failure to defend $9,400 on Monday activated a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern on technical charts.      The $1,500 sell-off seen in the last three days has violated the short-term bullish trend and exposed deeper support levels. However, signs of seller exhaustion seen on the intraday charts suggest scope for an extension of the ongoing recovery rally.    4-hour chart    The previous four-hour candle closed on a positive note, suggesting a weakening of downside momentum. That is backed by the long ntail attached to the preceding hammer candle.      A below-30 reading on the RSI indicates bitcoin is oversold, an indicator that's has also gained credence with the hammer candle.      As a result, bitcoin could soon challenge the psychological hurdle of $9,000. A break higher would shift the focus to the descending trendline resistance, currently at $9,275.      The case for a corrective bounce would weaken if a 4-hour candle closes below $8,520 – the low of the hammer candle shown above. That would imply a continuation of the bearish move.    Daily chart    Bitcoin closed (UTC) well below the Feb. 4 low of $9,075 on Wednesday, invalidating the bullish higher-lows set-up and putting the bears into the driver’s seat.      The five- and 10-day averages are trending south, indicating a strong downside momentum. Here, there are no signs yet of oversold conditions: the RSI is hovering in bearish territory below 50 and suggesting scope for a further drop.      Put simply, the daily chart is aligned in favor of a drop to $8,280 (100-day average) and $8,213 (Jan. 24 low).      The bias will remain bearish as long as prices are trading under the former support-turned-resistance of the head-and-shoulders neckline, currently at $9,430.

Volodymyr Kvashuk, 25, was convicted Tuesday by the U.S. District Court in Seattle of 18 separate federal felonies that defrauded Microsoft out of a total of $10 million, according to a statement from the Department of Justice.      A Ukrainian citizen based in the town of Renton, Washington, Kvashuk worked full time for Microsoft from 2016 to 2018. Involved in developing and testing the company's online retail sales platform, he used his account access to steal what is described as ""currency stored value"" including digital gift cards that he subsequently re-sold on the internet over a seven-month period.      Kvashuk built a lavish lifestyle using the embezzled funds, purchasing a $160,000 Tesla and a lakefront home worth an estimated $1.6 million. After uncovering the scheme, Microsoft confronted Kvashuk and fired him in June 2018.      Kvashuk, who claimed at trial to be working on a special project for the company, stole amounts totaling roughly $12,000 under his own account before using test email accounts associated with fellow Microsoft employees to begin embezzling millions of dollars from the company. Changing funds into bitcoin, he would use a mixing service to obfuscate its origins before transferring the ill-gotten gains into his bank account.      In total, bitcoin proceeds of over $2.8 million were transferred into his bank account. In tax returns filed during this period, Kvashuk claimed the funds were a gift from a relative.      The trial, which lasted five days, found the engineer guilty on five counts of wire fraud, six counts of money laundering, two counts of aggravated identity theft, two counts of filing false tax returns and one count each of mail fraud, bank card fraud and using a company computer for illicit purposes.      Speaking after the trial, special agent Ryan Korner from the Internal Revenue Service's criminal investigations division highlighted that Kvashuk's conviction was a result of work carried out by the IRS.      ""Criminals who think they can avoid detection by using cryptocurrency and laundering through mixers are put on notice ... you will be caught and you will be held accountable,"" he said.

Announced Tuesday, Azimo will begin using Ripple's On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service speed up the transfer of customer's funds. The service will notably utilize the XRP cryptocurrency to move value to the Southeast Asian nation ""in seconds,"" where it is converted into Philippines pesos and passed to recipients.      Remittance firms provide a vital service for the large numbers of Filippino workers abroad looking to send funds back home to their families.

42404089,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhIrx,1582791000,WATCH: Zcash Foundation Explains 'Compromise' Path to Funding ZEC Development,"Democracy is tough – maybe even more so for decentralized crypto networks.      Zcash investors, community members and its flagship firms – Electric Coin Company (ECC) and the Zcash Foundation – undertook an arduous governance refresh in 2019. The process, which ECC CEO and zcash co-founder Zooko Wilcox described as “emotionally painful” at times, culminated in an approved funding structure beginning in October 2020.      We asked Zcash Foundation Executive Director Josh Cincinnati about building sustainable ways to fund the development of zcash, a privacy-preserving cryptocurrency some view as a public good.      “The thing that really matters most when you are talking about funding public goods … is to establish legitimacy in the process. Everyone in the community, the people who use your protocol, are bought into the process that decides these things,” Cincinnati said.      Zcash is expensive to develop due to its high reliance on bleeding-edge technology. Indeed, the ECC, which conducts the majority of zcash’s protocol updates, issued an impressive privacy breakthrough with its “Halo” technology in 2019 – despite its books running in the red.      As CoinDesk reported at the time, the zcash founder’s reward was set to end four years after the cryptocurrency’s launch in 2016. Wilcox said in a Medium article in August he planned to raise the issue again once the reward was retired.      At ETHDenver earlier this month, Wilcox and Cincinnati pledged mutual support of Zcash Improvement Proposal (ZIP) 1014, which will go into effect around October 2020. Under the new fund, both firms will receive a portion of 20 percent of the network’s mining rewards set aside for funding the cryptocurrency’s development.      “It seems like a very good compromise that still enables the ECC to continue receive funding and the Zcash Foundation to receive funding,” Cincinnati said, “but it requires both organizations to adhere to pretty strict accountability requirements.”",NEUTRAL,ZEC,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | ZEC,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/02/27/watch-zcash-foundation-explains-compromise-path-to-funding-zec-development,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eca25a5d21c8706a845354caaff6e55d0e7da214-1400x797.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404082,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhIk5,1582788490,Cut the Consensus: You Can't Run a Business Like a Blockchain,"William Mougayar, a CoinDesk columnist, is the author of “The Business Blockchain,” producer of the Token Summit and a venture investor and adviser.      It has become trendy to apply blockchain governance principles to almost anything. But if we want to make blockchain organizations work, I believe we need to make an important distinction between the “governance of blockchains” and “governance by blockchains.”      What works for the technical realm of blockchains does not automatically translate to the running of businesses or social organizations, as attractive as it may be to apply the blockchain novelty factor. Democracy is great for society and government, but it is bad for business.      Over the past few years, we have learned a lot from the “governance of blockchains,” primarily about consensus and decentralization as the two primary characteristics. Consensus in the blockchain context refers to the nodes on the network agreeing to synchronize on the state of transactions for that blockchain. And decentralization is the preferred topology for these nodes: they are geographically distributed and diversely owned. This ensures redundancy of failures as well as a level playing field of participative inclusion, both important outcomes of open blockchains.      Our applied knowledge stalls thereafter.      We know much less about the field of “governance by blockchains,” as this is still at the experimental stage.    Consensus is a dreadful management practice for decision-making.    The desire to apply consensus methods and decentralization architectures to how we run organizations is an interesting concept. It stems from well-intentioned objectives wanting to mimic the governance of blockchains as a guiding strategy.      In the simplest form, people who have a stake into projects are seen like nodes, and they are given voting power. The more decentralized the better. Voilà. If it works for a blockchain, it should work for organizations, no?      Except that people are not computer nodes and consensus is a dreadful management practice for decision-making.      Many decentralized projects or ideas are slapping the word DAO to their names, in a loose way. We now have a Legal DAO, Marketing DAO, Investment DAO, Jurisdiction DAO, Democracy DAO, and so on (I’m refraining from naming actual names, though we all know who they are). These groups are obsessed with group-voting for decisions, being very transparent about their actions or discussions, and adopting decentralized inclusion from the beginning. As a result, they end up voting on everything and insist on public openness as a modus operandi.    The problem with decentralized decisions    Agreeing by majority voting doesn’t always result in the most optimal decisions, and it often leads you to compromise at the lowest common denominator level amongst the group, resulting in mediocre outcomes. Most decisions carry a degree of ambiguity and uncertainty that experienced decision makers are used to, whereas a group of people with less experience will rather debate these ambiguities for a long time, still without resolving them.      The tough and bold decisions are left un-tackled and never made by consensus because there will always be dissenting voices that will prevent these decisions from taking place. For example, a given idea might be beneficial economically to the majority of users, but not to a minority of them immediately. Do you change the decision so that all users get lower benefits, or do you take the tough decision to optimize for the majority of users first? There are never perfect decisions.    Popularity doesn’t always lead to the right decision. Just because it is popular doesn’t mean it’s the best.    One squeaky voice could lead to endless discussions, halting progress or delaying voting, without regard for urgencies or efficiency in implementation. The voting method can also break down when you end up with a less experienced majority that votes on the wrong decision. When the barriers are low for getting a seat at the table, just being there doesn’t say anything about the experience level of participants. Over-voting can lead to zig-zagging into iterative decisions with an appearance of progress.      Popularity doesn’t always lead to the right decision. Just because it is popular doesn’t mean it’s the best. Do politicians get voted in power because they are really competent or because they become popular enough to garner the required votes? Many elected officials (and even presidents or prime ministers) end up as bad choices after being elected, but the electors are stuck with them until their term is up. Elections by popularity vote are a type of irreversible decision-making that is hard to undo, even as we believe in the “wisdom of the crowd” thesis – that more people deciding equals better deciding.      How about accountability? In the most optimistic scenarios, the outcome of decisions turns out as predicted, but in many cases, things don’t always go as planned. Who is responsible for fixing what happened as a result of a bad decision? We can’t say, “well, we voted on that” and wash our hands. If 20 people voted on something and things don’t work out, who is to blame? Who will pick up the ball and fix things, change course or reverse decisions to ensure success?      Many decentralized blockchain projects do not appreciate the need for central leadership, and they brush that aside. It is not cool to take orders from others, or it’s not decentralized enough. Let the community decide, say decentralization advocates. But you can’t ignore leadership, because it is needed. Decentralization should not be about rejecting hierarchies and people management. The reality is that you can’t vote on everything, and people need to be managed with accountability in mind first.      Then there is the issue of culture. When decentralized groups are instantly assembled and they meet only sporadically, coalescing around a homogenous culture or agreeing on principles is difficult to achieve. In the context of blockchain operations, each decentralized nodes works for its own economic advantage, like a mercenary. But putting mercenaries together in a room doesn’t automatically yield cohesiveness at the required level of sound group dynamics.    Do DAOs work?    We are still in the early generation of DAOs. Almost four years have elapsed since the first DAO malfunctioned, but we haven’t had four years of experience working on iterative models since then. Only recently have we started to tinker again with business-minded DAO and decentralized decision-making across a variety of applied scenarios. It is easy to start a DAO, but much more challenging to devise the right structure to support and operationalize it.      We need to evolve the concept of business-minded DAOs with another level of sophistication among its practitioners. Baking programmable decision-making before enough experience has been gathered or previously acquired in whatever other relevant domain is a sure recipe for disaster.    Decentralization should not be about rejecting hierarchies and people management.    Governance is a very promising application of blockchains, perhaps after the transfer/ownership of money and the emerging field of decentralized finance. But blockchains and new-age governance are not going to reinvent the process of decision-making by throwing away decades of management soundness and best practices experience.      However, we do need more experiments to see if (and how) we can improve upon what we already have. For example, there are promising ideas in innovative voting mechanisms, such as quadratic voting, capital-constrained liberal radicalism (CLR) voting and other related variations that go beyond the blanket “one person-one equal vote” tradition. Quadratic voting is a distribution method that lets voters assign more than one vote across candidates. CLR voting takes into account the total number of votes and their provenance, not just the weight of that vote. So, for example, 500 votes from a weight of one share counts more than a single vote with a weight of a thousand shares.      Technical consensus in blockchains has been well defined and documented, and is backed by many years of research that culminated in Nakamoto putting it all together into bitcoin and its blockchain. But using blockchain consensus methods just for the sake of using them in business is not necessarily a breakthrough itself.      In business, life and technology, good decisions are good because they produce success. But good decisions are only judged in the rearview mirror, well after outcomes fully unravel.      You can’t easily automate decision-making just by configuring logic into a smart contract and trying to mimic and predict all scenarios that need judgment rather than automation. You must ask - what are we trying to fix or invent? And do we have the right people with the relevant domain experience and expertise at the table, beyond just knowing about blockchains?      You must define and organize your processes early on, and not fall into the trap of wanting to decentralize everything too quickly. Not every process needs to be on-chain. When embarking on a DAO experiment, you need to be clear on what is DAOable and what is not.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | RESEARCH,William Mougayar,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/02/27/cut-the-consensus-you-cant-run-a-business-like-a-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8c55ef9a0745c043d097f3bd91a265ad4958eedc-2000x1083.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404083,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhIl4,1582777735,Hong Kong to Consider Additional FATF-Style Regulations for Crypto Exchanges,"Hong Kong may soon bolster its policing of the cryptocurrency sector to better conform with international anti-money laundering (AML) norms, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said in his annual budget speech Wednesday.      Promising that “detailed proposals” will come later this year, Chan said new regulations could target virtual asset service providers, or VASPs, the catchall term used by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in its latest “Travel Rule” guidance.      New regulations could raise the heat on crypto exchanges, over-the-counter desks and brokers in Hong Kong, a global crypto hub. Such entities are already monitored by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), which in December recommended that VASPs stay vigilant in self-regulating their customers’ goings on.      “[Authorized institutions] should keep abreast of international and local developments to maintain an up-to-date understanding of risks, and apply a risk-based approach that supports responsible financial innovation as well as effective ML/TF risk management,” HKMA’s AML enforcer, Carmen Chu, said at the time.      The prospect of government-mandated regulations comes months after the FATF, the global AML standards-setting watchdog, rated Hong Kong “largely compliant” with its recommendations around emerging technologies like cryptocurrency. But Hong Kong wants to further build out its anti-financial crimes framework, Chan’s speech shows.      Countries are clamoring to get ahead of FATF’s crypto guidelines.

42404081,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhIi7,1582767125,Iranian General Advocates Crypto Use for Skirting Sanctions: Report,"An Iranian general is reportedly calling for the use of cryptocurrency to evade sanctions.      Saeed Muhammad, commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' ""Army of Guardians of the Islamic Revolution"" (or Sepâh for short), a branch of the Iranian Armed Forces, said in a speech Wednesday that Iran should look to cryptocurrencies to bolster international investment despite heavy sanctions on the nation, reported Coinit.ir.      ""We are demanding the creation of a more sophisticated mechanism (a commodities exchange) to bypass sanctions,"" he said. ""To circumvent sanctions, we must develop solutions such as the exchange of products and the use of cryptocurrencies with our partnerships [in other countries].""      The news was first shared by Coinit.ir, a Farsi-language crypto news organization, on Telegram Wednesday. (Telegram is a popular app for sharing information in Iran, with Bloomberg describing it as ""one of the most influential messaging platforms in the Middle East."")      Iran has long been a target of U.S. sanctions, with leaders and other residents being placed under individual sanctions through the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Asset Control's ""Specially Designated Nationals"" list. Sanctions are designed to isolate a nation from the global financial system, preventing international entities from investing in local projects or letting sanctioned nations easily trade with global partners.      The first sanctioned crypto addresses even belonged to Iranian nationals.      More recently, the Financial Action Task Force, the intergovernmental body that creates standards for combating financial crime worldwide, added Iran to its own blacklist due to alleged non-compliance with anti-terrorism financing requirements.      Iran has been laying the groundwork for a broader use of cryptocurrencies. The national government had previously been working with blockchain startups to update its financial infrastructure, with private banks backing some projects and the central government going so far as to provide funding for at least one company.      Speculation that Iran would formally try to evade sanctions using cryptocurrency has long been rampant, but at least one source told CoinDesk in February 2019 that it would be ""too suspicious"" for the central bank to actually go ahead with any project in that area.

42404092,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhIsw,1582765528,Over $190M in Bitcoin Liquidated on BitMEX Amid Crypto Market Sell-Off,"The cryptocurrency markets were shaken Wednesday amid a flurry of selling that saw more than $190 million worth of longs and shorts liquidated on well-known derivatives exchange BitMEX.      According to data analytics provider Skew, around $6.1 million buy and $190 million sell liquidations occurred, bringing it to a total of around $196 million worth of bitcoin (BTC) long and short positions.      Beginning at around 14:00 UTC on Feb. 26, the price of BTC began to fall below $9,000. An hour later BitMEX saw its largest amount of liquidations since the new year began, rising well above $100 million.      The move in the derivatives market comes during a sell-off in crypto's spot market that saw BTC's price fall more than 6 percent to a low of $8,675, CoinDesk BPI data shows.      Amid global coronavirus tensions, traditional markets are also in turmoil with major indices such as the S&P500 and Dow Jones Industrial down more than 7 percent on the week.      BTC's latest price action continues to throw cold water on the notion that cryptocurrencies can act as safe-haven assets during times of uncertainty around stocks and bonds with some of the largest levels of derivative volume ever witnessed.      ""Bitcoin has been uncorrelated to other asset classes. If stocks drop, this does not mean bitcoin has to pump. If gold prices climb, this does not mean bitcoin will rise with it every time,"" Coinist research analyst Luke Martin noted in a tweet.      In addition, options volumes on OKEx, another popular crypto derivatives exchange, saw the largest uptick of notional volume in its history, above the $15 million mark.      Notional volume is the value of the underlying asset in the derivatives market. It can be the total value of a position, how much value a position controls, or an agreed-upon amount in a contract.      When there is a large amount of notional volume on a downward price, that generally signals the movement as a legitimately bearish one.      Traders now need to look toward the 200-day moving average near $8,773, as failure to close above would likely result in deeper losses in the coming weeks.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/27/over-190m-in-bitcoin-liquidated-on-bitmex-amid-crypto-market-sell-off,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9bd849bbbb8a8fac4772fa0c174eccdf4f4384ba-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
