42377040,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6wPrN,1395699062,Hip Hop Group First to Test FrostWire's Bitcoin Integration,"Global merchants have embraced bitcoin as a payment option for products and services, and now the music industry seems to have taken notice of the digital currency's utility.  Electro-hip hop group Ain't No Love released its second EP Tears Of Joy last week, and the Toronto musicians teamed up with FrostWire to make history with the launch.  Ain't No Love's decision to provide Tears Of Joy as a torrent download with integrated bitcoin donations came naturally to the group, according to their manager Mark Cwajna.  The group offered its first, self-titled EP as a free torrent download through FrostWire, and were already planning on doing the same with Tears Of Joy when FrostWire approached them about bitcoin.  Said Cwajna:  ""FrostWire came back to us and approached us about a new feature they were offering, to integrate bitcoin donations for the torrents that are downloaded through the program. They asked if we would be the guinea pig for them and offer Tears Of Joy as a free download with bitcoin donations enabled.""  Reaching a new audience  Cwajna says the response to Tears Of Joy has been positive for Ain't No Love. The EP has been downloaded more than 5,000 times in less than one week after its release, and the group has received close to 50 separate bitcoin donations, ranging from 0.001 BTC all the way up to 0.06 BTC (around $35 USD at the time of publication).  Speaking to CoinDesk about the reception of Tears Of Joy, Cwajna said:  ""The response that we have received is really a testament to how tight knit the bitcoin community really is. We've reached more people with this release who otherwise may not have listened to Ain't No Love, and we're happy to bring awareness about bitcoin to the music industry.""  Cwajna went on to explain that while Ain't No Love's new EP is also available on iTunes, accepting bitcoin payments has allowed the group to ""skip the middleman"" and avoid the percentage of revenues that platforms like iTunes take from music sales.  Bitcoin in the music industry  The music industry has evolved significantly with the emergence of the Internet. Many consumers illegally pirate music online, putting a dent in record sales across the industry. Further, platforms like YouTube and various social media outlets have allowed artists to build their fame without the help of a major record label.  While Cwajna doesn't think pirating will ever disappear, he believes bitcoin has the potential to shake up the music industry by allowing artists to sell their music to fans directly, keeping all of the profit instead of giving a chunk of it to Apple through iTunes.  Beanz, a rapper and one-third of the Ain't No Love trio, added that bitcoin has the potential to impact the industry on a large scale:  ""I think other musicians are definitely going to jump on the opportunity to accept bitcoin for their music. At the end of the day, it's additional revenue stream for artists and it really does have the potential to change the game.""  To promote their new EP, Ain't No Love has released a music video for their single Blinded (below),and the Tears Of Joy EP can be downloaded on FrostWire for free, with the ability to make bitcoin donations to the group.

42377031,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6wPen,1395695243,Gyft Adds Retail Giant Walmart to its Bitcoin Gift Card Network,"Update 23:00 GMT - Updated with commentary from Gyft CEO Vinny Lingham  San Francisco-based mobile gift card app provider Gyft officially added US retail giant Walmart to its merchant network on 24th March.  The company took to Twitter to release the news that the largest physical retailer in the US, which earned more than $325bn from its US retail stores in 2012, and garnered more than $460bn in sales worldwide that year, had been added to its service.    We are so so so so excited to announce that @Walmart is finally on gyft! Enjoy Gyfters! #shopyourwalmartheartsout http://t.co/VHMj7eUhh4      — gyft (@gyft) March 24, 2014    Speaking to CoinDesk about the news, Gyft CEO Vinny Lingham indicated that he believes Walmart's decision reflects the strong brand his roughly two-year-old company has already successfully built:  ""I think it's pretty clear that we've built a great interface, we have great customers and we offer a great user experience. [...] We've built a brand, and retailers see that we have a very valuable position as an alternative to the plastic gift card on the rack model.""  Walmart Gyft cards can be purchased in denominations of $25, $50, $100, $250 and $500. Gyft provides 3% cashback on all bitcoin purchases using its cards.  Notably, Walmart's Gyft cards are also available for use at popular membership-only discount retail outlet Sam's Club.  Private ways to pay  In an interview, Lingham stressed that he sees the success of bitcoin and mobile gift cards as reflective to how retailers are responding to the desire consumers have for increased privacy.  Lingham notes, for example, that gift cards are gaining popularity with parents who don't want to share important financial information with their children, or risk that information in the hands of a companies that may be susceptible to data breaches.  Said Lingham:  ""Privacy is important, and the gift card market is a way to offer that. If you want privacy, you can use bitcoin and PayPal with us.""  Why Walmart matters  Walmart has more than 11,000 locations in 27 countries, including upwards of 3,000 Walmart Supercenters with full-service supermarkets and gas stations, meaning Walmart's Gyft cards will allow bitcoiners to redeem their bitcoins for a number of attractive new items.  Unsurprisingly, given Walmart's size and the extent of its offerings, it was among the most requested retailers by Gyft users.  The largest merchant previously on the network was the Minnesota-based retailer Target, which boasts 1,790 locations in the US and more than 100 stores in Canada.  Community reaction  The announcement ends more than four months of calls from the community for Gyft to strike a deal with the Arkansas-based megastore. Bitcoin users were particularly active posting to reddit about the issue in the wake of Target's November decision to join the Gyft network.  Lingham indicated that his company is always particularly proud after a big launch like this, saying: ""It's great that the community is behind us and engaged."" But, he remains focused on the next major merchants coming down the pipeline, hinting that more big announcements for the bitcoin community are ""in the hopper"".  So far, the outpouring has been highly visible on Twitter and reddit.    @gyft Of course! The first-world struggle is over now that I can spend my #Bitcoin at @Walmart.      — John R. Meese (@JohnRMeese) March 24, 2014    Gyft has been equally supportive of the bitcoin community, with CEO Vinny Lingham penning an open note to the community in November. That announcement indicated that Gyft would continue to invest heavily in adding merchants to its network that fit the needs of its growing bitcoin user base.  So far, it would seem, the company is showing it can get results.

42377046,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6wQ0B,1395692923,Auroracoin Airdrop: Will Iceland Embrace a National Digital Currency?,"Auroracoin  , the ""cryptocurrency for Iceland"", will begin distributing auroracoins to the country's citizens this week, starting tomorrow, 25th March.  The distribution, which is being called Airdrop, will send 50% of the total auroracoins in circulation to the country's populace. Icelandic residents that enter their permanent resident ID on auroracoin's official website will receive 31.8 AUR (roughly $385 at press time).  The fourth-place digital currency in terms of overall market cap, Auroracoin quickly rose to prominence amongst the myriad new digital currencies for its unique approach to community building. Further, as it climbed up the market cap leaderboard, auroracoin spawned a wave of imitators that has so far included scotcoin and spaincoinhttp://www.forexminute.com/cryptocurrency-news/inspired-by-litecoin-marketed-like-auroracoin-meet-the-new-digital-currency-of-spain-25712, among others.  Part of the reason for the interest was the altcoin's strong nationalistic message.  Auroracoin’s creator, Baldur Friggjar Óðinsson, told CoinDesk the purpose is to give Iceland an alternative form of money to the Icelandic krona, or ISK:  ""They [the government] want to force people to use a ruined currency, the ISK, of which they have printed way too much and which will be heavily sold when people will be free to do so.""  This idea that digital currency could be a liberating force, quickly spread.  But, this week's Airdop may have the final say on whether or not it has a lasting impact on Iceland and the digital currency community in 2014 and beyond.  How the Airdrop will work  In a detailed Airdrop blueprint section of the auroracoin website, there is a strategic plan in place to distribute the altcoin to Iceland's residents in stages.  Over the next four months, everyone in Iceland with valid permanent residency ID will be able to obtain 31.8 auroracoin. After that, there will be two additional stages where remaining AUR will be distributed. That amount will come from the remainder of the total premined 10.5M AUR set aside for Airdrop.  The stages are:  Stage 1 - Every Icelander will be able to claim a gift from me [Óðinsson] of 31.8 AUR, commencing on midnight March 25th. This stage will last 4 months.  Stage 2 - The Airdrop is reset. Every Icelander will be able to claim a part of the coins leftover from Stage 1 in the premine addresses. The amount of coins shall be calculated in the following way: (Stage 1 remaining coins / 330,000 = coins awarded). In this stage and the following, both the original recipients of the coins will be able to retrieve their gifts, as well as other Icelanders. This stage will last another 4 months.  Stage 3 - The Airdrop is reset again. Every Icelander will again be able to claim a part of the coins, leftover from Stage 2 in the premine addresses. The amount of coins shall be calculated in the following way: (Stage 2 remaining coins / 330,000 = coins awarded). This stage will last 4 months. At all stages the claimed coins will be a irreversible gift with full transfer of ownership.  Óðinsson warns on the blueprint page itself that there are uncertainties with Airdrop:  ""I can not guarantee a 100% fair outcome of the Airdrop and no claim can be made against me if there are imperfections in the process.""  Experts offer predictions  Auroracoin is an intruiging effort to many, not in terms of technological innovation, but in how it could mark the beginning of a new precedent for digital currency dispersion and marketing.  Travis Skweres, the CEO of altcoin exchange CoinMKT, addressed this point when speaking to CoinDesk:  ""One of the biggest problems that bitcoin faces is distribution. If [auroracoin] is wildly successful, I think we will see this model emulated in the future, it could be a very very big deal.""  Auroracoin is challenged by a lack of awareness, however, argues Dan Held, co-founder of Zeroblock and a product manager at Blockchain.info.  ""I think the concept of adding cryptocurrency as a meta layer on top of a pre-existing demographic is a cool idea, [but] I highly doubt more than 1% of the Icelandic population even knows about it.""  Others indicate that auroracoin's core technology will be its biggest obstacle.  Peter Bushnell, the founder of feathercoin, noted that scrypt ASICs, which may lead to centralized mining operations, are coming soon.  ""I remember several SHA-256 coins being devastated by SHA-256 ASICs when they turned up. I am not sure why auroracoin or any other coin right now would launch scrypt coins.""  Still, until it proves successful, some simply view it as an interesting novelty.  Adam Draper, whose Boost VC incubator accelerates bitcoin startups, summed up this view, saying:  ""Like bitcoin it is an experiment, however, they are claiming a nationality. I think that is an interesting concept.""  The case for auroracoin  Still, there is a powerful incentive for the country to embrace auroracoin.  In the wake of the 2008 global economic crisis when Iceland's banks defaulted on $85b, the Iceland government enacted capital controls to protect the krona.  Over the past three years, Iceland's rate of inflation has been over 4% annually.            In 2009 the IMF published a report that Iceland's capital controls were actually helping the country, but that over time capital outflow restrictions should be removed gradually.  But, the government has not acted on this advice yet, and there are concerns that the continued controls could cause massive sell-offs of the Krona in the future. A mix of annually high inflation numbers with anxiety about capital controls is the impetus for auroracoin as an alternative for Iceland's population.  Óðinsson says that auroracoin is a tool to give some power back to Iceland's people:  ""One of the most important power in society is the power over money. That is why the government monopolizes the Icelandic currency.""  Government views  For now, it's clear that the existing digital currency community has been the most receptive to auroracoin's message.  Auroracoin's relatively small number of coins in circulation has created a speculative market for it, and at one point it was more valuable by market capitalization than litecoin.  Whether because of speculation or the country's capital controls, the powers that be in Iceland are suspicious of auroracoin.  On March 14, the country's Parliamentary Economic Affairs and Trade Committee held a closed meeting to talk about the altcoin. No official notes regarding the meeting's agenda were made public on the Parliament's website.  Vice Chair of Economic Affairs and Trade, Pétur Blöndal, told a media outlet at the time that ""consumers were not warned of this medium,"" as a method of exchange, while the chairman of the committee, Frosti Sigurjónsson, has written on his website that he believes auroracoin is a scam.  Predicting the results  Theories abound on how tomorrow's airdrop will be received. Given that the general public in Iceland probably knows very little about auroracoin, much less digital currencies, many are anticipating tepid results.  Of course, a number of people could go claim their coins, dump them on the market and fill up the sell order book, dropping the price. Though counterintuitive to the purpose of auroracoin, the fact of the matter is, it's free money for people living in Iceland, and those inclined will see the opportunity to cash out.  Exchanges see the opportunity, too. UK-based bitcoin buying and selling service Bittylicious has announced today that it will be bringing on auroracoin. Others will do so as well.  Auroracoin, in effect, will allow Icelanders to circumvent currency controls. The question is whether it will cause the price of each coin to drop precipitously.

42377036,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6wPiZ,1395690253,Europol Seeks New Powers to Clamp Down on Digital Money Laundering,"Europol, the European Union's top law enforcement agency in charge of criminal intelligence, is urging legislators to provide law enforcement with greater powers to identify criminal activities online, including digital money laundering.  Europol is not a law enforcement agency in the traditional sense, but rather furnishes EU law enforcement agencies with support, including intelligence, information exchange, expertise and training.  The organisation launched the European Cybercrime Centre last year, and one of its goals is to target organised groups that make their money online.  Digital currencies as an instrument to facilitate crime  Speaking at a security conference on 24th March, Europol head Rob Wainwright issued statements that suggest he believes law enforcement agencies are ill-equipped to crack down on those who use digital currencies for illicit means, Reuters reports.  Said Wainwright:  ""We're seeing that virtual currencies are being used as an instrument to facilitate crime, particularly in regard to the laundering of illicit profits.""  Wainwright went on to argue that police should be given new powers that enable them to identify criminals online. He warned that police simply do not have the capabilities to operate online and identify criminals operating in ""dark areas"" of the internet, or the deep web.  The deep web is of course the vice-ridden part of the World Wide Web, used also by many privacy lovers, but its relative anonymity has also attracted a sizable cybercrime community. Pseudo-anonymous digital currencies like bitcoin remain one of few viable payment systems on the deep web.  The case for greater enforcement  Wainwright warned that criminals are ""abusing freedoms"" made possible by technology to damage society and potentially threaten the security of millions.  His sentiment is shared by a growing number of digital currency advocates, who have grown tired of people associating bitcoin with black hat hackers, Silk Road and ransomware.  Earlier this year, Irish lawmaker Patrick O’Donovan called for a parliamentary probe into digital currencies and their effect on illicit financial transactions. He warned that digital currencies and the deep web have effectively created an online supermarket for illegal goods and services, and called for an EU-wide response to the problem.  Although the risk of digital currencies being used for money laundering and crime is often overstated, many can agree that when it comes to organised criminal syndicates, the threat of abuse is real.

42377039,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6wPor,1395685863,UK Digital Currency Association Launches as Local Community Voice,"After months of behind-the-scenes work, the UK Digital Currency Association (UKDCA) announced its official launch on 24th March, a declaration that signifies it now has an incorporated entity, an operational website and established working groups.  The UKDCA is most notable for its work consulting with the UK's tax body, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC), on its decision to eliminate added costs imposed on bitcoin trades earlier this March. The decision was championed by the international community as a progressive move by the HMRC.  UKDCA member and Bullion Bitcoin owner Adam Cleary spoke to CoinDesk about the launch, indicating that this will be just the beginning of the organisation's work.  Cleary said that the UKDCA will serve as a trade association that benefits both the domestic bitcoin community, as well as the wider UK population.  Bitcoin community members can join the public group, free of charge, though paid memberships come with more substantial perks. Likewise, Cleary indicated that the public will gain a trusted informational resource.  Explained Cleary:  ""Governments, regulators, businesses, the media, [they] like to have these focal points they can deal with in old-fashioned, legacy terms. A trade association provides this focal point for the wider community.""  The organisation is being run by an interim board. An election will then be held to determine a full board of directors.  Interim board members include Cleary, Elliptic CEO Tom Robinson and BankToTheFuture.com co-founder Simon Dixon, among others.  Membership tiers  Cleary explained that the UKDCA plans to introduce three tiers of membership, using a model similar to the one the Bitcoin Foundation has parlayed to international success. The group had previously been operated as a part of the London meetup group.  The UKDCA's three membership tiers will include:  Industry members - pay the highest membership fee in exchange for the ability to display the UKDCA logo on their websites  Individual members - pay a small subscription fee to have their name listed on the UKDCA website and for board member voting privileges  Supporters - do not pay a membership fee, but are able to signal their support.  Working groups  will be focused on four topic areas - exchanges, regulation and accounting; business and financing; media, education and charity; technology and mining.  International collaboration  Cleary indicated that the UKDCA has been in touch with the Bitcoin Foundation, and that the two groups are currently discussion how they can best work together.  The UKDCA, Cleary noted, will be looking to support the foundation in the UK:  ""We are absolutely 100% non conflictive. We are here to do our stuff in the UK, and to be a UK-centered organization, whereas the Bitcoin Foundation is global.""  Cleary likened the organisation to successful groups formed in the Netherlands, Canada and Australia that operate as national trade organisations.  First public event  The UKDCA will hold a panel discussionhttps://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/its-the-technology-stupid-the-real-value-of-bitcoin-for-fintech-week-hosted-by-coinscrum-london-tickets-1085099261 on 31st March during FinTech Week to mark its launch.  Cleary, who is moderating the talk, indicated that it will primarily highlight the technology of the blockchain. Panelists include Ethereum's Stephan Tual; Netagio's Simon Hamblin; and more.  Following the introduction, the event will feature a regulatory update, a startup stories exchange and an open networking period.

42377049,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6wQ1R,1395680431,"Forget the Moon, Bitcoin Can Now Take You to the Summit of Mt Everest","If the recent negative press concerning bitcoin has been getting you down, here is a bit of news that should put you on top of the world – quite literally.  Trek and expedition organiser Mt Everest Adventures has now started accepting bitcoin for its adventure packages – which include summiting Mount Everest itself.  The company, which is run from Australia by CEO Aseem Jha, offers a variety of excursions and treks in Nepal – from sightseeing trips around Kathmandu and its locale, to light tramps in the forested Himalayan foothills and tougher treks through stunning scenery to the Annapurna and Everest base camps.  However, the king of them all has to be the expedition to the very peak of the tallest mountain in the world – a trip that takes intrepid visitors up through the high grasslands on the Chinese side of the border, past yaks and their herders, to the Chinese Base Camp.  This is where the serious climbing starts towards a (hopefully) successful summit of the mountain at 8,848 metres above sea level.  Uphill climb    For companies such as Mt Everest Adventures, which rely on foreign customers for their survival, accepting payments from outside the country is both complex and expensive.    One of the problems is that Nepali currency, the rupee, is tightly controlled. The company says:  ""Even in [these] modern times e-commerce is not practised due to financial restrictions. For that reason, any kind of business has to be dependent on foreign e-commerce support [which entails] paying a lot on commissions just for running e-commerce on our behalf.""  Bitcoin offers a way to make international payments a lot easier for the company, and importantly, a lot cheaper, with fees far below those of traditional payments providers.  Ideal solution  Jha said that after talking to a friend about the expense of getting paid in fiat currencies, he realised that bitcoin could offer a solution.  After some investigation, he decided to team up with Australia-based exchange and payment solution provider CoinJar to start accepting the digital currency.  ""Nepali currency has no value when it leaves the country and is tightly controlled. We believe that bitcoin, a new decentralized cryptocurrency is the solution for a small, dominated country like Nepal,"" the company said.  “We have a hope that we won’t have to depend on any restrictions imposed by foreign countries.""  CoinJar allows Mt Everest Adventures to place a bitcoin payments widget on the website and charges only a 1% fee to its merchants.  Said Jha:  ""With bitcoin we only pay almost nothing. With the banks [...] first there is the 2 to 3% that your payment gateway charges, then they charge on forex exchange, and we also need to have a merchant account to accept payments which costs monthly fees. More than saving, though, it is about easiness.""  The service launched today and unfortunately there is a technical hitch with the bitcoin widget, so Jha says has not taken any bitcoin as yet. However, he has had positive feedback from potential customers about the new service:  ""When i was building the site I shared this idea with bitcoin communities and they were quiet excited to trek in Nepal.""  So, if you have bitcoin to burn on the climb of a lifetime, Jha said that to summit Mt Everest will cost about $30,000 per person – which equates to about 53.3 BTC at today's prices.  However, if that's too steep a proposition, either fiscally or physically, there are plenty of cheaper and easier treks on the company's website.

42377041,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6wPsd,1395673385,New York Gears Up for Inside Bitcoins Event,"With Inside Bitcoins NYC 2014 fast approaching, event organisers continue to roll out more information about what its thousands of anticipated visitors can expect during the two-day conference on 7th April and 8th April.  Inside Bitcoins, to be held at the Javits Convention Center, most recently revealed via its website that American Banker executive director Marc Hochstein, with support from Wedbush Securities' Gil Luria, will be giving the keynote for day two's events.  The announcement finds Hochstein and Luria joining Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire and Blockchain CEO Nicolas Cary on the list of the event's keynote speakers, though their presence is no doubt a signal of the increasing appeal of bitcoin outside the industry.  However, good news for Inside Bitcoins NYC isn't limited to bolstering the event itself. As BitcoinNYC founder Jonathan Mohan can attest, Inside Bitcoins has a big impact on his weekly meetup group serving New York.  For Mohan, the conference is an opportunity to capitalize on increased local awareness of bitcoin. Explained Mohan:  ""The conference is great as an onboarding progress, because it gives people who aren't in the community an easy roadmap into the community.""  It's also popular with his existing members. Mohan indicates that since informing his community about the event to his group, more than 100 of its members have expressed that they'll be in attendance to access the show's free vendor booths.  Added Mohan with an air of understatement: ""There's a lot of interest.""  Inside Bitcoins 2013  Bitcoin NYC hasn't always been able to rely on strong strong support, however.  Mohan indicated that his group formed in March of 2013, a few months before the inaugural Inside Bitcoins NYC, held last July. Since then, he indicates he has noticed a key change at his meetup groups: attendees are more open about revealing their backgrounds in discussions, a sign he suggests that bitcoin's credibility is increasing, thanks in no small part to events like Inside Bitcoins.  Said Mohan:  ""Initially in early last, we'd have people say 'I work in finance' or 'Oh, I work on Wall Street'. Now we have people who say [they] work at Morgan Stanley or Goldman Sachs or Bloomberg.""  Preparing for the event  Of course, Mohan will have a bit more responsibility at this year's event than his fellow meetup attendees. That's because Mohan will be moderating the ""New Ideas in Bitcoin"" discussion, one of two panels that will directly follow the event's opening keynote speech.  That panel will include Peter Earle, chief economist at Huminit; Chris Odom, co-founder of Monetashttp://monetas.net/news; Ryan Charleston, CEO of Bitcorati; James Gatto, a partner at Pillsbury Law; and Bitcoin Center NYC deputy director Austin Alexander.  Still, Mohan isn't phased at the prospect of leading one of the day's first events.  ""I see it as no different than a meetup, which is to say, I don't see it as the Jonathan Mohan show, I see it as facilitating a discussion between the people in the group. It's a logical extension of something I've been doing for a few hours a week for the last year.""  Event preview  Mohan was able to share some of the topics that he is excited to speak about with his panel at the event. These included distributed corporations (Ethereum, MasterCoin, BitShares) and branded coins, among other topics.  Mohan also suggested that his personality would be onhand to help energize event attendees for all that day one has in store.  ""I'm a high energy guy. I'll try to keep them awake.""  Though, if the event's full speaker lineup is any indication, he likely will have plenty of support in this goal.

Computer security company Symantec has identified a new version of an old worm that has been going after Linux-based routers and set-top boxes for some time.  The Darlloz worm, as it is called, has evolved to attack Linux desktops and to press them into service as unwilling cryptocurrency miners, IDG News Service reports.  Darlloz is a rather unusual piece of malware, as it was originally developed to wreak havoc on embedded device architectures – computer systems within mechanical devices, such as printers.  In its latest incarnation, however, the coin-mining worm seeks out Intel-based computers running Linux, installs the 'cpuminer' program and sets the PC to mining for either dogecoins or mincoins.  Attractive altcoins  Since bitcoin can no longer be effectively mined by personal computers, the developers of the Darlloz worm sensibly opted for scrypt mining instead. Scrypt is the 'proof of work' algorithm used by many altcoins, such as litecoin and dogecoin, whereas bitcoin uses SHA-256.  Symantec researcher Kaoru Hayashi said scrypt-based altcoins can still be successfully mined on standard PCs, hence malicious developers now find them a more attractive proposition than bitcoin.  Fortunately, the worm appears to be propagating slowly and it is not doing much damage. Hayashi cited one attacker who used Darlloz to mine 42,438 dogecoins and 282 mincoins, with a combined value of less than $200.  However, Hayashi cautioned that the situation could get worse:  ""These amounts are relatively low for the average cybercrime activity, so we expect the attacker to continue to evolve their threat for increased monetization.""  Internet of Things  Staying true to its roots, Darlloz is still targeting plenty of devices that cannot be used for mining. Symantec identified over 30,000 devices infected with the worm last month, with half of the infections being in the US, China, India, South Korea and Taiwan.  More than a third of all infections had nothing to do with PCs, Symantec said, as they involved Internet of Things (IoT) gear, including printers, routers, set-top boxes and IP cameras.  These devices tend to be vulnerable to attack as they are not patched as regularly as PCs. Hayashi said that updating firmware and changing default passwords can go a long way towards protecting such devices. Blocking connections to port 23 and port 80 helps too.  Other dangers  Although this is a curious case of mining malware for Linux, it should be pointed out that the vast majority of cryptocurrency related malware is designed to target Microsoft Windows.  Dell SecureWorks recently published a report on cryptocurrency stealing malware (CCSM), which found that 147 strains of CCSM in the wild. Less than 1% of all cryptocurrency malware, however, is designed to attack Mac OS X or Linux.  Another danger for owners of cryptocurrency is ransomware that demands on bitcoin for payment. The latter also comes in a hybrid form, which blackmails the user into paying a bitcoin ransom, while at the same time mining for bitcoins.  The heyday of bitcoin-mining malware has long gone, but coin-stealing malware and bitcoin ransomware is on the rise.",NEGATIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | DOGE | LTC | MINING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/24/linux-malware-evolves-to-mine-cryptocurrencies,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/623fc309282be64363cc7499814fbe60956b5427-1000x745.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42374525,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvlCmh,1395662027,Australian Manufacturer Debuts First Cashless Bitcoin ATM,"An Australian company says it has produced one of bitcoin's holy grails: a cashless ATM that allows users to buy bitcoins using a credit card, and sell bitcoins via a direct deposit to their bank account.  The first fully functional Diamond Circle ATM arrived from its manufacturer in Brisbane this week. Unlike competing ATMs and vending machines that rely on QR codes and cash, Diamond Circle’s solution is based on near-field communication (NFC) technology with paper receipt backups.  This unique approach is the brainchild of CEO Stephen Rowlison, a seasoned FinTech (financial technology) entrepreneur with 30 years of IT experience in Australia, Asia and the US. Before founding Diamond Circle, Rowlison was working on various projects developing NFC payment and loyalty card systems for retailers. He said:  ""I was interested in NFC technology and payments, but just needed a unit of transfer. After learning about bitcoin, I figured I could combine the NFC chip with the ATM idea.""  He added: ""What I've really done is just brought together two existing technologies: contactless NFC and BTC. QR code payments have been outlawed in China and have no inbuilt card security, which is why using contactless technology makes so much sense.""  Wallet tags  Although Rowlison is exploring other NFC devices for his ATMs, he has decided to focus on a 'wallet tag' for now, which is a small disc that can be used as a pendant or keychain.  ""It's got the same smarts as banking technology except we mandated a Personal Identification Number for all tags that are registered online.""  It’s the same contactless technology being deployed in some countries by Visa's PayWave and Mastercard's PayPass. Australia's point-of-sale debit card network EFTPOS, which uses PC compatible devices, has also begun using NFC chips.  This all means Diamond Circle will be in a dominant position to launch its second phase: POS integration that will enable retail merchants to accept payment in bitcoin using devices they already have.  The 'wallet tag' devices function as cold storage wallets that communicate with the cashless ATMs. Customers also have the option to print out paper receipts and use them with more traditional smartphone or desktop wallet clients. The paper receipt can also be used as a backup for wallet tag users.  Diamond Circle customers can use the NFC 'wallet tag' device with a number of smartphones to check bitcoin balances and broadcast their public address.  More secure storage  Diamond Circle provides customers a secure way to store and use bitcoins. The company does not provide online bitcoin wallets that are often susceptible to theft. Diamond Circle wallets and private keys are stored only on the wallet tag devices and paper receipt backups.  ""Even if we get hacked, there's nothing to take,"" Rowlison said.  Diamond Circle will save a fortune by not handling physical cash. Once a machine needs to handle paper (or in Australia's case, polymer) dollar bills it reduces the value proposition by increasing the costs of its production, materials and maintenance.  He insisted the technology itself was a lesser challenge, since it uses mostly off the shelf components that have already been tested in other payment systems.  ""Once we ironed out the problems of bitcoin, the value proposition for consumers and the entire supply chain becomes obvious. instant cheap international money transfer and payments.""  Working with the current financial system  Often the bigger test faced by Diamond Circle and other bitcoin startups is learning to function within the regulatory environment. Rowlison said his focus has been on developing a compliant product with all KYC/AML regulations built in, meaning Diamond Circle ATMs are fully compliant.  This focus has helped the company form the necessary partnerships with banks and other financial institutions, though there has still been some resistance.  ""It hasn't been easy, we've had two rejections from major banks,"" Rowlison continued.  ""They just need to understand risks can be managed, it's just a matter of getting that through to them. I don't see it as an 'Us vs Them' situation, bitcoin is just another currency, we can coexist. We need to figure out how we can cooperate.""  He said there had also been ""a bit of pushback on locations"" from larger shopping malls worried about the product being delivered. The company may need to prove its technology first in a smaller location, like the coffee shops and cafes that house bitcoin ATMs elsewhere, then move to larger centers.  International interest  The company is an 'Enrolled Money Transmitter Business' and is run by a team with extensive C-Level experience in various fields of compliance in Australia and in the US.  Diamond Circle has received international interest in their ATMs already with queries from customers in in the UK, Canada, USA, Asia and the Middle East, and says it has already sold two of its ATMs within Australia and one to the UK.  The company is listed on cryptostocks.com under the ticker XDC, a direct pass through to their underlying shares, which helped them raise initial seed capital.

42397414,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb9Lma,1395657939,Kraken Bitcoin Exchange Passes 'Proof of Reserves' Cryptographic Audit,"Bitcoin exchange Kraken has passed a cryptographically verifiable proof of reserves audit with flying colours.  The audit, which was carried out by Stefan Thomas on 11th and 22nd of March, proved that more than 100% of Kraken's bitcoins are held in reserve.  The process was designed to allow the auditor to verify that the total amount of bitcoins held by Kraken matches the amount required to cover an anonymized set of customer balances.  Covering all balances  Thomas said the audit was very strict, but at the same time it maintained ""absolute privacy"" for customers. He also added that Kraken have expressed interest in conducting regular audits in the future, with different auditors each time. Thomas said:  ""I am attesting to [...] the root hash of a merkle tree containing all balances that were considered in the audit. If you are a customer of Kraken, you'll be able to verify using open-source tools that your balance at the time of the audit is part of this root hash. If it is and if you believe that I am trustworthy, then you can be confident that your balance was covered by 100% reserves at the time of the audit.""  Using the ‘Merkle Tree’ technique originally proposed by bitcoin developer Greg Maxwell, the auditor went on to explain the gritty technical details. He was provided with a JSON file from Kraken, which contained the list of the exchange's addresses and balances. The file was then compared against a copy of the block chain.  The results were in order, Thomas concluded: ""The actual holdings were very slightly (< 0.5%) above the required holdings, meaning Kraken had greater than 100% reserves at the audit block height.""  A competitive edge  Following the Mt. Gox crisis, many exchanges are keen to distance themselves from the troubled exchange and other bitcoin outfits with a chequered track record. Security and transparency have become selling points, hence exchanges appear to be doing their best to reassure investors on a regular basis.  Earlier this month UK-registered bitcoin exchange Bitstamp released the results of its own financial audit, which found that it held 100% of its validated BTC balance and USD funds. No issues were raised by the auditors.  Bitstamp CEO Nejc Kodrič told CoinDesk that his company plans to perform regular audits, with quarterly results posted on the Bitstamp website.  As investors demand more security and transparency, exchanges have to oblige or suffer the consequences and lose their competitive edge. Low fees are just one way of remaining competitive, but transparency and sound reporting practices might prove more important in the long run.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/24/kraken-bitcoin-exchange-passes-proof-of-reserves-cryptographic-audit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ee573bd500e18702c47e5dd9d481aea9b76b3c7f-1000x734.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397426,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb9M3J,1395619376,"Bitcoin Regulation Roundup: Bankruptcy, Derivatives and Consumer Protection","Regulatory attitudes towards cryptocurrencies around the world are shifting. Hardly a day goes by without a central bank issuing a warning on the digital currency. However, it’s not all bad news – as some authorities are taking a much more positive approach.  In CoinDesk’s regulation roundup, Certified Public Accountant and ACFE Certified Fraud Examiner Jason Tyra examines the most significant digital currency news from the world’s regulators and law courts over the past two weeks.  MT. Gox: Frozen assets  Mt. Gox has now filed for bankruptcy protection both in the United States and in Japan. Additionally, both the company and Karpeles have had their US assets frozen in connection with numerous civil complaints and at least one criminal probe.  Karpeles testified in a Texas bankruptcy court on Monday, March 10th, that Mt. Gox was the target of a massive and lengthy attack by computer hackers, but admitted that the exchange continued to accept trading orders and collect fee income for weeks after management knew that Gox was technically insolvent.  Further, Mt. Gox has so far failed to explain the reason for the discrepancy between the amounts of cash liabilities on its balance sheet and the balance of cash held in banks accounts known to be owned by the company.  As the drama plays out in public on multiple continents, online forums have buzzed with theories about the source and extent of the collapse, rumors of wholesale theft by Mt. Gox management and voluminous amounts of data alleged to have been leaked (or stolen) from Gox’s servers.  Nevertheless, no allegation, including the official statements by Gox management, has yet been conclusively proven. Mt. Gox’s website restored partial functionality on March 17, allowing account holders to check their balances, but not make withdrawals.  The Mt. Gox affair has set the stage for a shift in the focus of bitcoin regulatory efforts in the United States from money laundering exclusively to also include consumer protection.  New York: Registered exchanges  The State of New York seems to taken the lead in its drive toward regulating bitcoin-related businesses operating there.  The State Department of Financial Services, headed by Ben Lawsky, recently announced that it will accept proposals to establish regulated exchanges in New York.  Lawsky cited “the urgent need for stronger oversight […] including robust standards for consumer protection, cyber security, and anti-money laundering compliance” in his solicitation for applications and proposals.  The standards of acceptance and process of application do not appear to be available through the Department of Financial Services website, suggesting that both will be handled in an ad-hoc manner, with extensive input and negotiation by applicants.  New York’s only bitcoin exchange, BitInstant, ceased operating after the arrest of its founder on money laundering charges in 2013. CoinMap.org currently lists more than 100 bitcoin businesses operating in New York State, but that number does not include businesses located outside New York with a regulatory nexus there.  The US Treasury may have concluded that bitcoin is unworthy of extra regulation for the time being. In a speech given on March 18th, US Treasury Undersecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence said:  “Terrorists generally need ‘real’ currency, not virtual currency, to pay their expenses.”  The Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has cracked down over the past year on unregistered exchanges, resulting in disruptions to bitcoin businesses and users throughout the world.  While registration requirements are unlikely to be eased, a de facto moratorium on further regulation is likely to be a welcome development.  Texas: Bitcoin investment blocked  Consumer protection seems to be on the minds of other regulators, as the commissioner of the Texas State Securities Board has issued an emergency order barring a private energy exploration company from accepting investments in bitcoin from non-accredited investors.  The company, Balanced Energy LLC, must also furnish potential investors with a disclosure informing them that bitcoin is volatile and that their investment may be subject to extraordinary risk as a result.  Both US federal and Texas state law require companies offering securities under one of the registration exceptions to take reasonable steps to verify that potential investors are qualified.  Offerings of unregistered securities by bitcoin-related businesses have become common over the last 18 months, with solicitations for everything from mining operations to exchanges and other tech startups being pushed online. Though failure to register is not generally a criminal matter, firms that violate the rules can face substantial civil penalties.  US: SatoshiDice in trouble  Also in securities registration, the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) is reportedly investigating whether bitcoin gambling site SatoshiDice violated registration rules by accepting funds from investors located in the US.  MPEx, the Romania-based exchange that hosts SatoshiDice shares, has so far declined to cooperate, citing lack of jurisdiction by the SEC.  US: Bitcoin derivatives?  Bitcoin derivatives may be coming to US financial markets. According to Bart Chilton, a member of the US Commodities Futures Trading Commission, the regulator already has statutory jurisdiction over a proposed derivatives market for bitcoin.  Chilton suggested that his agency had been in talks with several companies about bitcoin derivatives, but declined to name them, since no formal applications have been filed.  A derivatives market would allow traders to write calls, puts, swaps, options and other types of contracts on bitcoin in much the same way as other investments. However, while derivatives might result in more robust long-term growth of the bitcoin economy, they also bring a risk of greater volatility to bitcoin markets.  The enormous worldwide derivatives market played a substantial role in the 2008-2009 financial crisis in the US, as bets on the performance of certain classes of assets drove a large number of previously profitable companies into insolvency.  Singapore: Compulsory registration  The city-state of Singapore has announced that virtual currency related businesses, including bitcoin exchanges and other intermediaries, will be required to register with a unit of the police force that enforces anti-money laundering rules.  According to the Monetary Authority of Singapore, these regulations place the tiny nation at the forefront of virtual currency regulation among developed countries.  Singapore’s decision to impose anti-money laundering regulation on bitcoin businesses marks a reversal from its previous stance, announced just a few weeks ago, and coinciding with the installation of its first bitcoin ATMs.  Iran: Regulation talks  Iran has reportedly announced its own effort to regulate virtual currency trade within its borders. According to the Fars News Agency, the country’s National Center for Cyberspace is currently involved in talks with the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Iran’s Central Bank concerning what regulations might be needed in the Islamic state and how they might be implemented.  Iran has endured punishing economic sanctions at the hands of western countries in recent years, stemming from its alleged pursuit of a nuclear weapons program. The country has publicly claimed that the program is for civil purposes only.  The sanctions, which were partially lifted recently, have severely hampered Iran’s ability to trade abroad, drained its foreign exchange reserves and driven the country to resort to extraordinary measures, such as gold bullion smuggling, to conduct business abroad.  Bitcoin could be used to partially subvert economic sanctions in the future, stoking fears among western governments that it could also be used for money laundering.  US anti-money laundering rules require financial institutions, such as money service businesses, to “know their customers” – that is, collect ID data – and ensure that they do not appear on the Office of Foreign Asset Control’s Specially Designated Nationals list.

42397417,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb9LxP,1395619306,"Exchange Vircurex Freezes Withdrawals, Claims Lack of Reserves","Beijing-based virtual currency exchange Vircurex has frozen most of its digital currency withdrawals effective immediately, claiming it no longer has the reserves to cover customer requests.  The freeze will affect all bitcoin, litecoin, feathercoin and terracoin withdrawals. A message on Vircurex's site says it will create a new balance type called 'Frozen Funds' covering all balances in the aforementioned currencies. The company maintains it won't be shutting down, saying it intends to ""gradually pay back the losses"".  That Vircurex had a reserve shortfall had been known for some time, though not the exact amount. It froze BTC/LTC withdrawals in January 2013 after reporting that wallets had been compromised, but still allowed deposits in those currencies to continue. The attacker had apparently exploited a vulnerability in Ruby on Rails posted online just the day before.  The company pledged to cover the losses from its own income and had been doing so until yesterday, when ""large fund withdrawals in the last weeks"" completely depleted its cold wallet reserves.  Similarities  While Vircurex's volumes and deposits were nowhere near Mt. Gox's levels, the story is significant thanks to the similarities: hackers supposedly lift thousands of bitcoins from an exchange, the exchange desperately tries to cover the loss before users sense something more serious is up and start a run, leading to a withdrawal freeze.  It has raised questions about exchanges operating fractional reserve systems, either openly (as in Vircurex's case) or covertly, in both cases due to a theft.  Proof of reserves  There are now calls for online exchanges and wallets to prove their reserves somehow, possibly using a cryptographically secure proof of inclusion and proof of reserves system such as a Merkle Tree, or hash tree.  South Korean exchange Korbit announced recently it would be the first major exchange to offer such a service with its opt-in 'BitTrust' system. Since 21st March, 57 of Korbit's users have signed up to participate, covering a total balance of over 580 BTC. It has kept BitTrust opt-in only for now due to trade-off in transparency vs. 100% balance privacy.  Long standing exchange  Vircurex opened for business in October 2011, and traded between BTC, USD or EUR, plus up to 18 other cryptocurrencies against each other, eliminating some less popular coins over time.  Users on bitcointalk first started noticing bugs interfering with trading and withdrawals around late February and early March, which grew in number until this week's problems. The site then apparently stopped any-to-any currency trades late last week before announcing the freeze.  Losses will be paid back according to a 'top-down/bottom-up' distribution logic, according to the site announcement. That means 50% of available funds will be used to pay the largest balance holders and the other 50% the smallest, meeting somewhere in between.  ""All users will eventually receive their funds, though the timeframe depends on the monthly volume available,"" the announcement continued, saying the logic guaranteed new users would not be penalized and thus supporting the platform's operations until all amounts have been returned.
