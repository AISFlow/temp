42377726,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73BIp,1413327618,IMF and World Bank Panel: Bitcoin Block Chain Could Boost Financial Inclusion,"This weekend private and public sector delegates convened for a panel discussion about technology’s role in achieving greater global financial inclusion as part of a four-part seminar series at the Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group in Washington, DC.  The panelists included Standard Chartered Bank group chief executive Peter Sands; Colombian Minister of Finance and Public Credit Mauricio Cárdenas; Visa global head of strategic partnerships Bill Gajda; JPMorgan Chase global chair of technology, media and telecom and investment banking Jennifer Nason; and professor of economics at Yale University Dean Karlan. Vice chairman of the US Federal Reserve board Stanley Fischer moderated the discussion.  At the outset, Sands spoke generally about the need for business model reforms to allow the operational and commercial impact of technology’s promise in the financial services industry.  “What we haven’t seen is this kind of sweeping, total transformation of the business model that you’ve seen in industries like music or publishing – and the reason I talk about those is that they’re digital industries and there is nothing about banking that is inherently physical,” he said, adding:  “Even notes and coins are essentially tokens and property rights; they don’t have to be physical.”  Sands was also the one that later introduced the matter of “cyber currencies – bitcoin and so on” and the only delegate to voice his position on them. He said he is unconvinced that they will be more than a niche application, but called the underpinning block chain technology “a true computational innovation that could be very powerful in the context of financial inclusion”.  Interoperability issues  Gajda echoed Sands’ sentiments about the business model, saying there is a lot of work required to address things like transaction costs for micropayments and issues of interoperability.  While the delegates from the banking and payments industries gave favorable responses to the wave of new technology and innovation so ingrained now in financial services, he said that interoperability will be key in driving the next level of scale. To get there, Gajda concluded, would require some business model innovation from everyone.  The Visa executive didn’t speak about digital currencies specifically, though one could apply many of his points on how to use technology to help financial services grow and move towards alleviating global poverty to bitcoin itself.  Gajda noted:  “I’m actually very confident about the rate in which technology will advance in these markets and the way it’ll be used to provide scalable and secure payments. The challenge as I see it really isn’t a technical barrier. I think there are some business model barriers and I think a lot of it has to do with consumer education.”  Transforming titled property  There is a counterpart to the financial aspect of financial inclusion: fundamental property rights.  Sands appeared enthusiastic about the potential of bitcoin technology and its potential to reform titled property, which he called “the most bureaucratic, inefficient mechanism there is” in Western countries as well as the developing world.  He explained:  “You could transfer title to the thing youre buying … If you’re buying a car or a house, your transfer of title using this kind of distributed ledger-type technology could be massively more efficient than the system at the moment.”  If people are going to become economic actors, he added, they must be enabled to establish and transfer property rights, especially as they acquire entrepreneurial tools and skills and eventually become small business owners.  “That’s where I think actually some of these block chain technologies could be really powerful,” Sands concluded.  Infrastructure is key  Cárdenas focused more on the currency aspect of digital currencies, maintaining a critical attitude toward the technology during his remarks.  When discussing inclusion, he put particular importance on the need for a money transfer system in which the sender isn’t required to pay up to 10% in related transaction fees.  “We need to make sure that people who are using those services that are so overpriced have access to technologies where they can take advantage of these efficiencies,” he said. “And that means using less cash.”  However, he added that when he thinks of bitcoin, he also thinks about the value of controlling money “in the broad sense”, placing a lot of weight on policy as a means of stabilizing any economy, generating the conditions for growth and low inflaton, and doing so “under the traditional payments system”.  To this, Fischer responded:  “There’s a very interesting line of research as to whether you actually need the physical money to be there in order to control the price of it or whether you can do it with just the interest rate so it’s clear that as long as there’s an epsilon of money you can control the price or interest rate and then the questions what’s the limit of that process which nobody knows at the moment.”  Image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Tanaya Macheel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/10/14/imf-and-world-bank-panel-bitcoin-block-chain-could-boost-financial-inclusion,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6154b763aa3998bf0e4cf15214bfc86f55c9196a-1434x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377755,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73Bcx,1413311713,"All Things Alt: Block Chain Notaries, Bottle-Backed Coins and a Darkcoin Update","After a low-volume summer in the community, we just might be seeing some activity that, fingers crossed, could kickstart the alternative digital currency marketplace.  Although the risk of project collapse is still out there, as recent failures like ghostcoin have shown, recent developments in the space indicate that the altcoin story is far from over.  Viacoin team implements block chain notary service  One of the next-generation use cases proposed for the block chain is that of a notary. Instead of relying on a central authority to certify the authenticity of a document, the block chain can be used to assert the proof of its veracity via distributed cryptographic confirmation.  The viacoin development team has developed a block chain notary system as part of its ClearingHouse protocol, a smart-contract infrastructure built on the viacoin block chain. The notary system, demonstrated in a recent video posted on YouTube, is now available for use as part of the ClearWallet implementation.  Viacoin developer BTCDrak explains in the video:  “So the block chain notary takes time-stamping to a new level. It also uses proof-of-publication to embed cryptographic hashes of files into the block chain. But it also gives the ability to own and transfer these to other participants in the same way you would bitcoins.”  The system works by inserting a representation of the document in question into the block chain. This helps secure the privacy of the document and those seeking certification.  According to the viacoin team, a block chain-based notary represents a solution to a real-world problem – expensive and ineffective infrastructure for notarization and transferring documentation. As the notary is built into the viacoin block chain, fees associated with the service are limited to network mining fees.  A demonstration of the viacoin block chain notary can be found here.  A sitdown with darkcoin developer Evan Duffield  The darkcoin project has seen some significant developments in the past two weeks, ranging from the open release of its source code to a recent security incident that resulted in the temporary loss of majority control of the darkcoin masternode network.  Despite the challenges, the darkcoin development team remains committed to pushing ahead. In a new interview, developer Evan Duffield framed the trials and tribulations as par for the course for any long-term technology project.  Duffield told CoinDesk that the open-source release had been long in the planning, coming as a result of a step-by-step process in a tight and competitive market. Owing to the fluid nature of altcoin development, the darkcoin team sought to avoid releasing any problematic code if they could help it.  Duffield explained:  “The issue is once you open the source, if there’s anything wrong with it, that will get replicated across the whole crypto community. You don’t want a really bad privacy bug in 20 or 30 coins, so we decided to do this in a staggered approach.”  He thanked cryptocurrency advisor and author Kristov Atlashttp://anonymousbitcoinbook.com/pages/about-the-author for his work on auditing the darkcoin code, which resulted in a number of security fixes. More information about the audit, which includes a reply from Duffield with regards to the fixes made, can be found here.  During the interview, he explained the instant transaction initiative unveiled last month by the darkcoin development team. Using the masternode network as a second layer of authentication, the proposed implementation would act as an intermediate confirmation stage prior to the first block confirmation.  “We’re in talks with an ATM provider right now – we’re looking for point-of-sale type companies that would be willing to support it,” he said.  Duffield added that the rapid expansion of the crypto economy is helpful for altcoin projects like darkcoin, providing a means to both educate the broader market and assist initiatives in gaining wider exposure.  Strange alt of the week  It’s often been said that the key to a great coin is an even greater development team. Much of the success – and as many would argue, value – of an altcoin lies in both the capability and integrity of those who are actually shepherding the project.  Just as important as ability is the overall vision of a coin. In order to thrive, the theory goes, a project needs to be focused enough to get things done, but not too narrow in scope to become bottlenecked at the first sign of trouble.  A new project called cocacolacoin (sign: ICOKE) is part of an umbrella initiative known as NILIcoins, which are presented as so-called 'art coins' depicting popular brands like Apple, eBay and Coca-Cola. The developer behind the project argued on Bitcoin Talk that he or she wasn’t violating copyright law by creating the coins, stating:  “The coins are being describe as artworks, and as such no property issues are applied. When I will issue the Coca-Cola coins or the Toyota coins, I will make use of their logo and the coin will have all the features which a real Coca-Cola coin or a real Toyota coin should have one day, only it will be marked with the NILIcoins trademark to mark it a an art piece. Nevertheless this coin will carry its own value based on it being an art piece.”  For this unusual approach to utilizing copyrighted material for altcoins, cocacolacoin has won this week’s Strange Alt of the Week award.  The coin uses a 'peg' of 1 bottle of Coke, although the post on Bitcoin Talk states that “this bottle is an art piece not [a] real soda bottle”. It then suggests a value of 0.01 BTC per ICOKE, with a per-artwork value of 0.1 BTC.  “In the real Coca-Cola coins case, it will make sense to keep a much smaller gap between the market price and the coupon coins,” the developer explains.

42377683,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX737LV,1413297514,MIT Bitcoin Trading Simulation Yields Profit of 89% in 50 Days,"Trading bitcoin profitably remains more of an art than an exact science.  On any given day, Reddit is awash with theories explaining bitcoin price movements, ranging from exotic technical indicators to the machinations of FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) peddlers.  That may change, however, with a new paper that claims to have devised a trading strategy that can produce an 89% return in less than two months.  The authors, Massachusetts Institute of Technology associate professor Devavrat Shah and computer science student Kang Zhang, collected data from OKCoin, the world's largest exchange by trading volume, from February to July.  They fed the data into a predictive statistical model they have developed and used the results to conduct a simulation of CNY/BTC trades. In the simulation, the trader could only go long or short 1 BTC in each trade.  Volatility boosts profits  The trading simulation, conducted on data taken from 50 consecutive days in May and June, produced highly profitable results. The simulated trader invested 3,781 yuan and made 2,872 trades. The total cumulative profit was 3,362 yuan, or an 89% return on the amount invested.  The trading strategy produced the greatest profits when volatility was high, in the period at the end of May and the start of June, and was still profitable when the price declined steadily at the end of the simulated period.  The trading strategy also produced a Sharpe ratio of 4.1, the authors write. This expresses a portfolio's return after adjusting for the risk-free rate of return. A high ratio shows that an investor produced returns while taking on less risk, with scores of three and over being considered excellent.  The authors' Sharpe ratio compares favourably to benchmark mutual funds, like the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund, the world's largest such vehicle, which is worth $355bn. That fund has a one-year Sharpe ratio of 1.79 and has returned 8.32% in the last year.  Peering into the data  The paper's results may also support the claims of technical traders in bitcoin markets. The authors analysed their prediction data and found evidence of 'triangle’ and 'head and shoulders’ patterns in the price charts.  ""This seems to suggest that there are indeed such patterns and [... explains] the success of our trading strategy,"" they write.  A preliminary version of the paper, titled Bayesian Regression and Bitcoin, was published in the Proceedings of the 2014 Allerton Conference on Communication, Control and Computing – one of the longest-running and most prestigious conferences in its field. The three-day conference concluded on 3rd October.  Given the simulation's restricted trade size of 1 BTC, could more money be made with more capital at stake? The authors write that more research is required, although they speculate that profit can be magnified.  The authors also note that further profits could be produced by crunching more data, although this would require ""computation at a massive scale"". They used a 32-core machine with 128GB of RAM for the study and ""representative"" time-series data at the predictive modelling stage.  Origins in Twitter analysis  Shah and Zhang's predictive simulation is based on a 'latent source model' that was described in a paper published last year and was designed to predict what would become 'trending topics' on Twitter.  Shah co-authored that paper with two researchers at MIT and Twitter. Their model was able to predict trending topics accurately up to 79% of the time, according to the authors.

42377701,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX737i9,1413291660,Practical Sessions and In-Depth Talks Mark Final Day of Hashers United,"'Hands-on' was the major theme of the Hashers United digital currency mining conference in Las Vegas this weekend.  Instead of the familiar seminar-style gathering, day two consisted of workshops, discussion-style workshops and more inclusive talks that focused on the nitty-gritty experienced by miners both great and small.  The day was split into two tracks: 'Build' and 'Profit'. The Build workshops included discussions on rig and overall mine development, mining pool operation and long-term strategic planning.  Those who took part in some of the Profit sessions looked at the art of analyzing altcoins, delved into crypto business operation and wielded soldering irons in a bid to squeeze some extra efficiency out of mining ASICs.  As venture capitalist and conference keynote speaker Tim Draper told CoinDesk, Hashers United offered an in-depth look into a sector of the bitcoin economy that doesn’t receive much mainstream attention.  Draper said:  “I learned a lot at the conference. I now have a strong sense that mining will be here for years to come, and will continue to be an amazing industry as the value of bitcoin increases. The industry will be volatile, but like the 49ers, bitcoin miners will have their great days and their poor days.”  “Bitcoin mining is awesome,” he added.  Foundation for finding blocks  Many topics discussed during day two touched on the elements of being in the mining business. Anthony Brough, chief operating officer and chief financial officer for MegaBigPower franchisee Aquifer LLC, led a talk on the dynamics of the broader mining industry.  Brough told attendees that those in the space face a real danger of failure if they don’t recognize the key factor in their business: cost. Brough noted that this process is already playing out and that the simultaneous difficulty rise and bitcoin price decline is exacerbating the situation.  He explained:  “I think what we'll see is a bifurcation of the market, of the ecosystem of miners, where you’ve got really big players and small players, with very little in the middle. The name of the game is your cost, and we’re already seeing consolidation in the space – that’s why we’re pushing to become bigger.”  A key asset for any miner that envisions long-term expansion, he said, is a relationship with a quality manufacturer. Ultimately, miners may need to be prepared to incur higher costs if it means they won’t encounter problems acquiring equipment.  “The reality is that I would pay a little more to be with a partner I trust and know is going to deliver than someone else,” he said.  Michael Carter, the host of crypto-themed YouTube show Bits Be Trippin’, focused on the aspects of creating a profitable mining rig – primarily on GPU mining – and shared some insights into how miners can get the most out of their machines.  Much of Carter’s talk had to do with the technical considerations of building and maintaining a rig. Given the broad range of graphics cards available on the market, the session explored strategies for monitoring performance, temperature and overall integrity.  During a post-session discussion, Carter told miners that efficiency – and potential profit – can come from unexpected places, particularly in GPU mining.  Although the volatility of altcoins is something that must always be considered, as explored in earlier sessions led by unbreakablecoin creator Jim Blasko and cryptocurrency developer Dominic Williams, a savvy miner can find ways to give his or her rig a boost.  Carter used a small GPU that had a surprisingly high hash rate given its electrical consumption as just one example.  The art of mining coins  During a session led by Final Hash executive technical director Marshall Longhttp://hashersunited.com/speakers/marshall-long-2/, a group of miners learned how to squeeze some extra efficiency out of a Gridseed ASIC.  As Long explained, understanding the device means knowing how to optimize every joule possible. In the case of the Gridseeds, he advocated removing the fan given the unit’s low heat output.  Using soldering irons, those who took part in the session first removed the fan connector cables and later joined a new connection with solder on the Gridseed’s circuit board. Long offered a 0.5 BTC prize to the miner with the cleanest connection, resulting in a close contest after several miners turned in pristine-looking solder jobs.  Later, Final Hash executive director Valton Eason talked with miners about the ins and outs of running a cryptocurrency-centered business. The seminar looked at the legal and financial implications of operating a mine and selling digital currency for profit.  Other sessions that delved into both the conceptual and practical aspects of cryptocurrency business management, included one on mining pool creation and management, led by Final Hash senior developer and myriadcoin developer Ahmed Bodiwala.  Additionally, Jim Thompson, CEO of smart contract platform Pavillion.io, gave a presentation on using the block chain to create performance monitoring strategies, and Stephan de Haas, developer of the Haasbot cryptocurrency trading software, offered an introduction to high-frequency trading.  The future of mining  The final seminar of the convention was forward-looking, both for the industry itself and the individual miners that occupy it. The panel included vertcoin developer Poramin Insomhttp://hashersunited.com/speakers/poramin-insom-developer-vertcoin/, Final Hash’s Marshall Long, Mastercoin developer Phil Maherhttp://hashersunited.com/speakers/phil-maher-mastercoin/, GAW Miners CEO Josh Garza and ZoomHash founder Michael Cao.  Many of the topics discussed touched on the multiple risks that miners have to balance in order to stay profitable. This subject held particular weight for attendees given the simultaneous decline in the price of both bitcoin and many altcoins, including litecoin.  Long said that in order to avoid potential scams that lead to lost time and money, miners need to do their research into developers before offering their hashes.  He noted:  “It really comes down is, how knowledgeable is the dev team? You have to double check and make sure [they] know what they’re doing.”  The panel also touched on the mining industry’s role in bringing new entrants into the market. Although mining isn’t often considered a public-friendly part of the ecosystem, the speakers said that miners and mining companies have an incentive to get more people involved.  Garza said:  “It’s easy to sell to the same customer base over and over again. The trick is, how do you get someone on Facebook? A friend? My mom, who knows nothing about technology? When [new people] get into the technology, they start using the coins [and] the ecosystem grows as a whole.”  He later told CoinDesk in an interview that conventions like Hashers United help spread the cryptocurrency message as it relates to both mining and the broader technology.  Vertcoin’s Insom was asked what developers of new block-chain projects, particularly altcoins, can do to help them succeed in what is an increasingly crowded ecosystem.  “First, you have to come up with a good intention first,” he said. ""Once you have a good intention, you must have good execution – a good team for the execution.”  “That’s pretty broad,” he added, laughing.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/10/14/practical-sessions-and-in-depth-talks-mark-final-day-of-hashers-united,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/28c69b22f0426ae6a3d1451f790242be0a006ac6-2560x1696.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377684,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX737Ml,1413283862,IMF and World Bank Annual Meetings Explore Block Chain's Potential,"The Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group were held in Washington, DC over the weekend and notably, the subject of bitcoin and its underlying technology was brought up for discussion.  Some participants likened the digital currency to Esperanto, the language created in 1887 to be an international medium of communication, in that it's a good idea theoretically but that it might not live up to its potential. Others criticised it as a poor store of value, according to a report from Mexican bank Banorte.  The bank reports attendees as saying:  ""Nobody believes bitcoin or any of these will take over the world as the next global currency. In this context, some compared this to what happened with Esperanto, taking over the world's language of choice, which as we all know, has not happened at all.""  However, it also indicates the lending institutions are starting to take notice of bitcoin's disruptive potential.  Sceptical view  The Banorte report says that financial institutions are having to deal with increasingly restrictive regulation, while at the same time they need to tackle new and disruptive technologies, including digital currencies.  ""Scepticism about the use of bitcoin and other so-called 'digital cryptocurrencies' is all over the place with comments such as 'stay away from bitcoin ... It is a mirage' or 'it's a terrible store of value', sponsored by Warren Buffet and Jamie Dimon, respectively,"" the report states.  Yet, the topic also came up in different agendas during the meeting in a more constructive way.  Benefits in finance  Although panellists do not expect bitcoin to take over the global currency system, they are open to the idea of applying digital currency protocols to develop new platforms and deliver new features.  There was recognition that such protocols could serve as an ""initial layer"" upon which platforms of fully blown payment systems could be built.  ""The main nicety is that this protocol conducts real-time operations, in which value is transmitted, instead of the current use of corresponding banking, representing a liability for one of the counterparties, in both, simple money transfers and FX operations. This reduces transaction costs and counterparty risk,"" the bank says.  One example of potential block chain applications in the financial sector is Epiphyte, a crypto-finance platform designed to connect banking networks with cryptocurrency networks. Epiphyte won the SWIFT Innotribe Startup Competition at the Sibos 2014 event in Boston earlier this month.  Summing up, Banorte says the sentiment toward cryptocurrencies was overall balanced:  ""All in all, instead of perceiving a full rejection of cryptocurrencies, we observed a much more constructive assessment of these around its operational aspects to build more secure and cheaper-to-use payments systems.""

42377692,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX737Wp,1413278740,Dorian Nakamoto Launches Legal Fund to Refute Newsweek Claims,"A campaign has been launched to fund legal action against Newsweek on behalf of Dorian Nakamoto, the California man the magazine claimed was the inventor of bitcoin back in March.  The campaign has set up a website called newsweeklied.com, a twitter account and a bitcoin address for donations to the 'Dorian Nakamoto Legal Defense Fund', which can also be donated to with credit or debit cards.  The case is being handled by Los Angeles arts and entertainment and industry lawyer Ethan Kirschner of Kirschner Law. Nakamoto first hired Kirschner as his lawyer in March, saying, ""I unconditionally deny the Newsweek report"".  The fund website states:  ""A lawsuit against Newsweek will be very expensive. Dorian does not have the resources to pay the costs of such a suit, let alone attorneys' fees. Monies raised by the Fund will be used to further Dorian's legal claims against Newsweek; anything remaining will be given directly to Dorian for his expenses.""  Community doubts  The news of the fundraising campaign was initially met with some skepticism from the bitcoin community, but a tweet from Andreas Antonopoulos initially appeared to confirm its legitimacy.    @DanielJonss @DorianSatoshi @newsweeklied @ethankirschner This is in fact backed by Dorian Nakamoto.      – AndreasMAntonopoulos (@aantonop) 14 Oct 2014    Antonopoulos had organized a previous fundraiser for Nakamoto in April. That campaign has raised over 49.5 BTC (almost $20,000 at the time of publication) to date, 34.5 of which still remains at the address.  He clarified, however, that he does not personally endorse the new campaign. When approached on the issue, Antonopoulos told CoinDesk:    ""From conversations I had with Dorian Nakamoto, I am aware that this is something Dorian endorsed and is being run by his lawyer. Other than knowing those facts, I have no further knowledge of any details. I am not involved in any way, nor do I support or endorse this fundraiser.""      ""I know Dorian was inconvenienced by Newsweek and would like to clear his name, as he has said publicly many times. I am skeptical as to whether a lawsuit is a wise or effective way of achieving that. I personally believe that free speech is extremely important and that poor journalism should be met with ridicule and public criticism – the cure for bad speech is more speech.""    It is also not known whether Nakamoto himself had initially approached Kirschner Law for representation. A message sent to Kirschner's office by CoinDesk on the question remained unanswered at press time.  Unwanted attention  Dorian Nakamoto was first claimed to be the bitcoin founder in March in a feature article called The Face Behind Bitcoin by journalist Leah McGrath Goodman. In the story, Goodman wrote that the name 'Satoshi Nakamoto' had been ""repeated by everyone from bitcoin's rabid fans to The New Yorker"".  As evidence, she presented her interviews with those close to Nakamoto and his ""circuitous"" employment history which included some classified work for the US government.  Goodman never spoke to Nakamoto directly about bitcoin, claiming he had ceased responding to her enquiries once she mentioned the word. Attempts to question him on the topic through family members also produced little result.  Assuming Nakamoto's elusiveness as confirmation, Goodman then attempted to speak to Nakamoto directly by visiting his house, at which point Nakamoto called the police.  Nakamoto, 64, who has suffered both unemployment and health problems in recent years, was hounded by the media after Newsweek’s story appeared, causing him, he has said, further hardship.  The website concludes:  ""If a private citizen like Dorian can be targeted and victimized by a reckless news organization, it could happen to others. Please help us to remind Newsweek and the press community of their continuing legal and ethical responsibilities to the broader public.""",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | REGULATION,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/10/14/dorian-nakamoto-launches-legal-fund-to-refute-newsweek-claims,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e22f251d677bc78d504bded79b10c59de93d26bc-1500x966.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
