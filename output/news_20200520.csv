42383793,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ybhL,1590011371,US Lawmaker Proposes Legislative Groundwork for National Blockchain Strategy,"A U.S. lawmaker wants the federal government to begin considering a national blockchain strategy.      On Tuesday, U.S. House Rep. Brett Guthrie (R-KY) introduced a bill calling on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to survey the prevalence of blockchain technologies across industry, government and the globe. CoinDesk obtained a draft version of the bill, HB6938, which is shared in full below.      If passed, the bill, which had no cosponsors when referred to the House Energy and Commerce Committee, would give the FTC two years to conduct the survey and a further six months to advise Congress on what it learned.      Guthrie calls for recommendations on state-level blockchain adoption, business sector blockchain adoption, blockchain development plans, risk mitigation strategies, legislative frameworks and how to consolidate potentially prohibitive federal statutes.      The recommendation package would effectively outline a comprehensive blockchain strategy for the United States.      Some U.S. allies already have such a framework, including Germany. (The proposed FTC survey would give lawmakers a rundown of at least 10 countries’ blockchain strategies’ relative to the U.S.).      But Guthrie’s main concern appears to be the clear leader of national blockchain strategies, and an adversarial one at that: China.      “We cannot let China beat us,” he said in a press statement.      In April China launched the Blockchain Services Network, and it is now moving swiftly forward with testing of its central bank digital currency, the digital yuan. It has aggressively courted state-sponsored blockchain use cases far beyond the actions of the U.S.      Read more: Blockchain Now Officially Part of China’s Technology Strategy      Staying a step ahead of China has gotten only more crucial in the age of COVID-19, Guthrie said.      “The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has made it clear that we need to maintain American leadership in technology,” he said in the statement. “America is a nation of innovation and enterprise – and we need to keep it that way.”      The bill is part of an emerging tech legislative package by House Republicans.

42421881,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwn6b,1590007874,Bitcoin Foundation,"The Bitcoin Foundation is a nonprofit organization based in Washington, D.C., that was founded in 2012 to change the public perception that bitcoin is associated with fraud and criminality. Additionally, the foundation seeks to positively influence regulation and policy issues associated with cryptocurrency by educating lawmakers on the ecosystem. The chairman of the board of directors is Brock Pierce, with Bobby Lee acting as vice chairman.  A year before the launch of the foundation, bitcoin had come under increased scrutiny. A bitcoin savings and loan bank was being investigated as a Ponzi scheme, hackers stole over $250,000 worth of bitcoin from online trading floor Bitfloor and two U.S. senators raised alarm at bitcoin’s role in the newly launched Silk Road. The foundation launched in 2012 with Peter Vessenes as its first chairman. Gavin Andresen, who became the ""lead developer"" of bitcoin after Satoshi Nakamoto left the project, was brought on as chief scientist, for which he received a foundation-funded salary.  Jon Matonis was named the new executive director of the foundation in July 2013 but stepped down in 2014 to do bitcoin-related work in the private sector. Matonis’ departure was preceded by the resignations of board members Charlie Shrem and Mark Karpeles. Shrem, the former CEO of Bitinstant, stepped down from the board after he was arrested in connection with facilitating bitcoin transactions on darknet market Silk Road. Karpeles, formerly the CEO of Mt. Gox, resigned from the board shortly before his company collapsed.  In 2015, the Bitcoin Foundation’s board voted Satoshi Roundtable-founder Bruce Fenton in as executive director of the foundation. Additionally, that year Olivier Janssens, a newly elected board member, claimed in a public blog post that the foundation was nearly “bankrupt” and had fired the majority of its staff. Janssens and fellow board member Jim Harper resigned from the board after both voted to dismantle the foundation.

42383809,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ybot,1590007449,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Rebounds to $9,500 After Scary Sell-Off","Bitcoin suffered a quick sell-off on Wednesday after a previously dormant address moved some of the earliest-mined coins for the first time. While bitcoin’s price has recovered a bit, downward selling pressure remains and could have an impact on stakeholders, especially in the derivatives and mining sectors.      As of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET), bitcoin (BTC) was trading at $9,529, a loss of 1.2% over 24 hours. Bitcoin moved below its 10-day and 50-day moving averages on high selling volume. It’s a signal of bearish sentiment after bitcoin dropped as low as $9,100 earlier in the day on spot exchanges including Bitstamp.      After a few days of prices staying pretty much flat, bitcoin trading activity has picked up. However, that activity was mostly from sellers after one of the oldest bitcoin addresses suddenly showed signs of life, moving up to 50 BTC around for the first time in 11 years. That caused a quick 7% price drop within an hour.      Read More: 50 BTC Just Moved for First Time Since 2009      This sell-off reminds traders to keep track of the oldest addresses in the bitcoin network, says Jose Llisterri, co-founder of crypto trading platform Interdax. “This occurrence highlights the importance of ‘address watching,’ monitoring the addresses of whales/early miners and the so-called ‘Satoshi coins’ mined in the first months of bitcoin.""      As of now, there is no evidence the 50 BTC were moved by accounts held by the pseudonymous “Satoshi Nakamoto,” the founder (or founders) of bitcoin.      While the price of bitcoin was able to recover some from the dip, stakeholders such as Mostafa Al-Mashita, head of business development for digital asset management firm Secure Digital Markets, are concerned the crypto market may be heading lower. “Coins from 2009 moving on-chain have definitely spooked some speculators about early players cashing out their coins,” said Al-Mashita.      Such selling also compounds losses because of leveraged derivatives positions that get liquidated. This dynamic is what exacerbated bitcoin’s massive drop in March to below $4,000 when BitMEX liquidations wiped out leveraged traders who were long crypto. Over $40 million in liquidations occurred during the time of bitcoin’s 7% drop Wednesday.      Another group of stakeholders watching the price carefully are miners. Bitcoin’s mining difficulty adjusted on Tuesday, a 6% drop in the computational resources needed for machines on the network to produce new coins. Mining difficulty is how much computational power it takes for miners to mine for bitcoin.      Read More: Bitcoin Just Got Easier to Mine, but for How Long?      Since the halving, bitcoin’s total daily rewards has been reduced from roughly 1,800 down to 900 BTC. Miners are more sensitive to price than ever before, despite the recent easing of difficulty.      Christopher Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank, senses bitcoin's price is too high despite today's selling activity. “I’ve felt we’ve been hanging around the $9,900 level without any conviction for the last week or so,” he told CoinDesk. ”We’ll likely move lower to the support levels around $8,000 and possibly further to $7,300.”      “The lower we go, the more sell volume from the miners. As their profit margins lower, they are forced to sell a higher percentage of coins,” added Thomas.    Other markets    Digital assets on CoinDesk’s big board are mostly in the red Wednesday. Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down less than a percent in 24 hour trading as of 20:05 UTC (4:05 p.m. ET).      The biggest digital asset dips in 24-hour trading were tron (TRX) slipping 2.8%, monero (XMR) down 2.8% and ethereum classic (ETC) losing 2.6%. Gainers on the day include zcash (ZEC) climbing 1.7%, cardano (ADA) in the green 1% and dash (DASH) up less than a percent . All price changes were as of 20:05 UTC (4:05 p.m. ET) Wednesday.

Asia’s Nikkei 225 index closed trading Wednesday up less than a percent as mixed trading performances were attributed to Japanese business confidence hitting lows not seen in ten years.

42383780,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ybUl,1590004503,Why $4M Dai Made From WBTC Matters for DeFi's Maturation,"The first large minting of MakerDAO’s dai stablecoin using a bitcoin synthetic has occurred, signaling user demand for inter-blockchain asset support on Ethereum’s largest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol.      Crypto lending platform Nexo minted $4 million dai Wednesday by using WBTC as collateral.    WBTC, an ERC-20 token created by placing deposits of bitcoin with crypto custodian BitGo, was approved as collateral on the MakerDAO platform on May 3. Launched in January 2019, WBTC’s market cap is currently $21.7 million, according to DeFi Pulsehttps://www.defipulse.com/wbtc.    “This really showcases the latent demand for non-ETH assets,” MakerDAO founder Rune Christensen said in a tweet, “and it’s the beginning of a broader trend of DeFi acting as an economic vacuum that will eventually attract almost all value to the ethereum blockchain.”      Adding exposure to bitcoin is a major step by DeFi’s leading protocol, giving Maker lenders access to the largest cryptocurrency by market cap for further issuance of dai-based loans.      Read more: The CoinDesk 50: MakerDAO Is the Godzilla of DeFi      Calls to add bitcoin onto the protocol have floated around the Maker community before but gained steam following the flash crash of ether (ETH) on March 12. At the time, Maker community members considered adding bitcoin, stablecoins and even tokenized gold as collateral assets to protect against further plunges in ETH’s price.      The community eventually added support for USD Coin (USDC), which largely alleviated dai’s dollar peg issues during the month of April. Yet, the wheels were in motion for the addition of bitcoin – as demonstrated with the early April addition of an ETH/BTC pricing feed on MakerDAO.      Some DeFi developers also believed porting bitcoin onto Ethereum would be a win-win: DeFi users could gain exposure to bitcoin’s liquidity – such as derivatives platform dYdX – while utilizing Ethereum’s transaction speeds. And, as the oldest and largest DeFi protocol, the addition of bitcoin to Maker would pave the way for bitcoin onto Ethereum in general.      The WBTC-generated dai could be used for a variety of purposes, data scientist Alex Svanevik said in a Medium post last week, including lending the dai at interest.      The initial WBTC minting took place on token sale platform CoinList, with Nexo minting 999.6 WBTC May 11. Those funds were then moved to Maker compatible wallet Oasis in two transactions of 1 WBTC – perhaps as a test – and 997 WBTC on May 13 and May 20, respectively. (Nexo did not return a request for comment.)      Read more: Why MakerDAO Should Consider Negative Interest Rates for Dai      The minting of $4 million in stablecoins represents some 3% of the amount of dai currently minted, but about 50% of the WBTC market cap, according to DeFi Pulse.      WBTC isn’t the only tokenized bitcoin competing for space on Maker.

42383784,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ybW1,1590001858,"UMA Project Creates Its First Synthetic Coin, Matching ETH Against BTC","Want to bet the price of ether (ETH) is rising relative to the price of bitcoin (BTC)? There's now a token for precisely that.      On Tuesday night, the UMA Project community approved contracts that allowed creating its first token: ETHBTC. This is a synthetic token whose value tracks the relative value of ETH to BTC, so if ETH is worth $200 and BTC is worth $10,000, an ETHBTC should be worth $0.02.      The intriguing thing about ETHBTC, though? No ETH or BTC is needed to make it.      This will be the first deployment of what UMA, a decentralized finance (DeFi) project, calls the priceless token model, one built from the start to minimize the need for oracles.      ""ETHBTC was selected as the first test for UMA's priceless synthetic design because it's DeFi-centric but not too serious,"" Hart Lambur, UMA's co-founder, told CoinDesk in an email. ""This first token is still experimental, so it felt wise to choose a product that appeals to hardcore DeFi natives – the type of people that might want to bet on this rate, and who best understand the risks of 'new' things.""      ETHBTC is available now on the new Uniswap, though the team is warning interested buyers: ""The mechanisms behind this design have not been proven in the wild. Users should proceed with extreme caution.""      Representing BTC on Ethereum to prove its value as collateral has become a prominent theme for DeFi in 2020.    'Priceless'    Below is an explanation of how ETHBTC is created, and it should basically describe how any other synthetic tokens might be created on UMA, though some of the variables will likely change.      To generate ETHBTC, a user posts dai as collateral to the smart contract. Based on the collateralization rate of 120%, the contract will allow the user to generate a specific amount of ETHBTC. They can then sell the new ETHBTC on the open market or they can use it to add liquidity to the ETHBTC pool that will be created on Uniswap (most interested buyers will probably choose to just acquire it directly on Uniswap).      Read more: Trust No Dapp: Chainlink Launches Oracle for Provable Randomness      UMA's synthetic tokens trade like any Ethereum-based token until their contract comes to an end. At that moment, the staked DAI will be split between token holders and stakers. If the value of ETH vs. BTC has gone up at the close of the contract, the token holder will get a profit on what they paid for it. If it hasn't, the staker will earn a profit on that original sale as the contract releases more dai back to them.      So token holders are long and stakers are short ETHBTC. Lambur described it as ""a sort of meta-bet on DeFi as a whole,"" because the most likely explanation for growth in ETH uncorrelated to BTC would be more people using DeFi products.      This is all quite new. The UMA team noted in their message that this is very much an alpha test in the real world. While it has been audited by OpenZeppelin, users should be very cautious about the amount of risk they take on.      ""We strongly encourage interested users to do their own research and proceed with caution in this experiment,"" Lambur wrote.    Eliminating oracles    Under the priceless token model, UMA does not need an oracle to function on a day to day basis.      ""What we're saying is: Let's not do any on-chain price ever,"" Lambur told CoinDesk in an interview. ""This is how you're going to have to scale DeFi,"" he added later.      The idea here is that everyone knows that the contract is going to have this defining moment when it comes to the end and the stakes get split up between stakers and coin holders. If the definition of the price is clear and transparent to everyone, the truth of the world should not be confusing at that moment. If so, then an oracle will never be necessary. People will just see what the truth was and accept that outcome.      ""Minimizing the dependency you have on your oracles is just good system design,"" Nik Kunkel, on the oracles team at MakerDAO, told CoinDesk. ""This type of oracle'less design is very unique to their system and the characteristics of the UMA system. It can't really be applied anywhere else.""      Read more: Uniswap V2 Launches With More Token-Swap Pairs, Oracle Service, Flash Loans      This was a point that Sergey Nazarov, creator of Chainlink, a network of oracles, also emphasized.      ""If you say, 'I'm not going to build data feeds to build financial products,' the number of financial products you can build is very small,"" Nazarov said. ""I think what they are doing is essentially an interesting experiment.""      That said, Lambur compared UMA's approach to paper contracts in the real world. Traditional contracts don't have to be publicly posted to function and most of the time no one but the parties ever see them because every one honors their side of the deal.      ""We are really trying to frame the oracle itself as being like taking someone to court,"" Lambur said.      In order to backstop price throughout the life of the contract, UMA also has a liquidation model. If anyone spots an undercollateralized position, they can trigger a liquidation event. Again, if they initiated it accurately under the conditions, ostensibly there will be no need to turn to oracles.      If there's a dispute, UMA token holders will settle it by coming together to vote. The holders who voted on the winning side will be rewarded in new token emissions. The economic model of UMA is designed so that it will always be unprofitable to buy up UMA tokens in order to vote through a false choice.      ""The tokens themselves, the token holders, form this court system which ultimately is the security of the whole platform,"" Lambur said. ""The whole overall premise for our token economics is we need the cost of bribing the system to be greater than the value of the system.""",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH | UMA,BTC | ETH | TRADING | UMA | UNI,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/05/20/uma-project-creates-its-first-synthetic-coin-matching-eth-against-btc,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7872d4060815007f4c37ef9f5b59e2a4c01f3f8a-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The scare brought a quick end to bitcoin's four-day rally. Prices for the largest cryptocurrency by market value fell to around $9,500 as of 17:15 UTC (1:15 p.m. in New York) from $9,788 on Tuesday. Earlier Wednesday the rapid sell-off took bitcoin as low as $9,100.      The hourly drop was the biggest tumble since May 10, when a brief outage on Coinbase caused the price of bitcoin to dip 10% in 30 minutes.      Wednesday's tumble was most pronounced on Luxembourg-based exchange Bitstamp, where the price for 1 BTC lost 7% in one hour.      The sudden drop came as crypto traders lit up Twitter after bitcoin blockchain data showed the address, inactive for 11 years, had moved up 50 BTC to different wallets, then another 9.99 BTC earlier in the day. The address' owner is unknown at present but the coins were valued at around $379,200 at press time.

But almost nothing supports the rumor the coins indeed belong to Nakamoto.      “Whale Alert,” a popular Twitter bot account that tracks on-chain transactions for multiple blockchains, tweeted that 40 BTC were transferred from a “possible Satoshi owned wallet.” The price dipped as the tweet quickly went viral.      Commenting on the market’s reaction, Hunter Merghart, head of U.S. operations at Bitstamp, said sellers on the exchange “got good fast liquidity and buyers were there to fill it. Everything worked as designed.”      See also: Price Drops 7% in an Hour After Bitcoin Sees a Ghost      That the coins were old (mined in 2009) and inactive (not moved until Wednesday) is the only link possibly connecting them to Nakamoto.      Commenting on the unconfirmed alert, bitcoin software engineer Jameson Lopp noted the script behind the account is a bit naive and should be improved for accuracy. “Y'all need to up your analysis game,” he tweeted.      More sophisticated analysis casts doubt on Nakamoto’s connection to these coins. Analysis of the habits of a single, early miner has been used to develop the “Patoshi pattern,” which is believed to indicate which blocks Nakamoto most likely mined and those he didn’t.      The “Patoshi” miner is believed to be Nakamoto, according to the hashrate analysis.

42383798,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ybmN,1589991511,Blockchain Bites: Bitcoin's Difficulty Adjustment and More,"Bitcoin's network difficulty adjusted downwards today, making older mining machines profitable once again, while Tokensoft distributed $4 million in tokenized equity to investors and technology firms are calling upon the Department of Defense to invest in the blockchain arms race. Here's the story:      You're reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they're significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk's newsletters here.    Top Shelf    Getting Easier The Bitcoin network just fine-tuned a key parameter to coax back miners who quit after last week's halving hammered their profits. Bitcoin's mining difficulty, which measures how hard it is to compete for block rewards, decreased 6% on Wednesday, in the network's first biweekly difficulty adjustment since the halving meant to keep the block interval at roughly every 10 minutes. This adjustment may lure less efficient miners back into the network.      Tokenized Distribution Tokensoft, a digital securities platform for enterprises and financial institutions, has used blockchain tech to distribute equity to investors in a $4 million seed round raised in 2018. The investors, including Base10 and e.ventures, Coinbase Ventures and Fidelity affiliate Avon Ventures, received a digital representation of their investments on the Ethereum blockchain using ERC-1404 tokens.      Blockchain Arms Race The U.S. Department of Defense can’t afford to lose the global military blockchain race to Russia and China, warns a new white paper by Amazon Web Services, IBM, Deloitte and others. “The two superpowers that pose the greatest threat to the U.S. are both heavily investing in both the research and development of blockchain technology,” the briefing said. China’s on the “economic warfare” offensive with its digital currency. Russia is on defense with a lab dedicated to blockchain cyber threat mitigation. For U.S. security interests, blockchain could assist the military in anything from “weapons release” [Ed. note: Just what bitcoin's founders intended.] to stopping data erasure, as well as bolstering command and control mechanisms.      Elliptic Growth Crypto sleuthing firm Elliptic has expanded its scope to cover some 97% of digital assets by trading volume – the broadest range of any crime-fighting blockchain analytics service, the company said. Announced Wednesday, Elliptic Navigator adds 87 new crypto assets to the firm’s existing purview. That said, touting just the number of coins covered can be “fairly irrelevant,” said Elliptic co-founder Tom Robinson, because analytics shops could be including many ERC-20 tokens that nobody really uses.      Flawed Code Keep Network says a flawed code addition forced the shutdown of its bitcoin-backed Ethereum token, tBTC, just two days after it launched. The bug affected the processing of deposit redemptions (when users try to pull bitcoin out of the system), essentially due to the code's inability to tell different types of bitcoin addresses apart. While the bug and subsequent pause have been a setback for the Thesis team, a new call out has been made to solicit help from code auditors to help track down any further issues.      Iranian Regulation The Iranian government just made conduits to cryptocurrency markets riskier, and more confusing, than ever before. According to Iranian news outlet ArzDigital, Iran's parliament published a proposal this week to include cryptocurrency in existing “currency smuggling” and foreign currency exchange regulations. The result of this prospective regulation is Iranian entrepreneurs face a heightened risk of being jailed by local authorities or sanctioned by Americans.      Coinbase to Comptroller A former top lawyer at Coinbase is about to take the top job at a major U.S. bank regulator, at least temporarily. Brian Brooks, the first deputy comptroller and chief operating officer in the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), is poised to become acting comptroller as his boss, Joseph Otting, is planning an imminent departure.      75 Million Devices Blockchain e-sports streaming platform THETA.tv will soon be available on Samsung's flagship Galaxy S20 smartphones shipping to the U.S. THETA.tv runs on the Theta blockchain and pays out a native token to content streamers, and will be included in the Samsung Daily app, extending its potential reach to more than 75 million smartphones and tablets.      Atari Token Ahead of Atari token’s September launch, the development team has partnered with the Litecoin Foundation to make litecoin an accepted form of payment for the token and across Atari’s “gaming ecosystem.” (The Block)    Opposite Editorial    Staking Will Turn Ethereum Into a Functional Store of Value Osho Jha argues ether’s current price does not reflect the protocol’s upcoming switch from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake consensus, which would turn the cryptocurrency into a functional store of value.      PTJ on BTC: Bitcoin Is Now the Macro Big Bet Byrne Hobart argues that Paul Tudor Jones’ big bet on Bitcoin is a signal to other institutional and traditional investors to view bitcoin as a legitimate hedge against inflationary monetary experiments. “[A]fter careful due diligence, the famous trend-chasing macro investor ultimately treated bitcoin as a value play,” Hobart said.      Facebook’s Toothless Oversight Board Has Lessons for Blockchain Cathy Barrera digs into Facebook’s oversight board, which recently announced its founding members, calling the system necessarily flawed and unable to account for the myriad problems the company may generate or find itself dealing with. “Facebook's inability to create a genuinely independent body with real control over content decisions is an essential lesson for blockchain projects,” Barrera writes.    Market Intel    $1B in Open Interest Open interest in options listed on the Panama-based Deribit exchange jumped to a record high of $1 billion. On Tuesday, 101,000 options contracts were open on the most popular exchange. Each option contract on Deribit represents one bitcoin. “The new record is driven by market sentiment, an increased number of diverse global participants on Deribit and the efforts made by our various partners and us to provide a premier quality market at all times with the highest capital efficiency, integrity and connectivity and trading solution,” said Luuk Strijers, Deribit's chief compliance officer.      Bitcoin Undervalued Bitcoin has witnessed triple-digit percentage gains over the past two months. Yet, a key measure known as the Puell Multiple suggests the currency is still undervalued. Lows in this metric, which currently sits below historic levels, have marked the beginning of fresh bull runs in bitcoin’s price.      Mining Metrics Bitcoin became 6% easier to mine Tuesday, a rare dip in Bitcoin's lifetime in which difficulty has almost always trended upwards. Despite the recent adjustment, the current difficulty is still well over double what it was this time last year – a sign of just how competitive the mining business has become. Yet, according to Coin Metrics data, many formerly unprofitable machines are turning on, including Bitmain's Antminer S9s, which saw their heyday in 2018. The halving made them less profitable, but the easing in mining difficulty should help to improve margins.      Exchanging Out Glassnode data suggests holders are withdrawing Bitcoin out from centralized exchanges. Beginning around March 12, when bitcoin’s price cratered, the market has entered “the largest and most prolonged BTC exchange balance downtrend in bitcoin's history.” (Decrypt)    The Breakdown    ‘Minsky Moments’ and the Financial History of Pandemics Jamie Catherwood, of quantitative long-equity investment firm O’Shaughnessy Asset Management and Investor Amnesia, joins The Breakdown to discuss historic connections to today’s market meltdown.

42383765,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9yYLl,1589986298,Brazil Regulator Votes to Continue Probe Into Banks' Rejection of Crypto Firms,"Brazil’s biggest private banks are not out of the woods yet.      On Wednesday, Brazil’s antitrust watchdog, the Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE), voted to continue its investigation of banks who denied financial services to crypto brokers in alleged violation of Brazilian competition law.      CADE’s nearly two-year-old inquiry into Itaú Unibanco, Banco do Brasil, Santander, Inter, Bradesco and Sicredi now returns to the General Superintendency for further review, as per the decision by CADE’s chief tribunal. Those six banks comprise the lion’s share of Brazil’s banking sector.      The ruling, made by a seven-member tribunal, reopens the possibility that these powerhouse banks – they held over 80% of deposit market share during the time in question – could face eventual sanctions and even be forced to provide financial services to crypto brokers.      Such an outcome appeared unlikely as recently as last week, after the General Superintendency, CADE’s investigative wing, tried to close the case on technical grounds. But on May 13, Counselor Lenisa Rodrigues Prado called upon CADE to reopen its investigation.      In Prado’s view, these banks failed to give reasonable justification for shutting out crypto brokers. She found “significant evidence” that they had violated Brazilian laws protecting market competition and called upon CADE to initiate a sanctions inquiry.      Fernando de Magalhães Furlan, a former CADE official who leads the Brazilian Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Association’s (ABCB) charge against the banks, said the ruling “is a victory to the Brazilian crypto sector. ABCB represents 39 crypto brokers, according to Furlan.    Shutdowns    Crypto brokers and banks had been at loggerheads before CADE launched its probe in September 2018. Banks, weary of the legal grey zone that cryptocurrency trading inhabits in Brazil (and allegedly fearful cryptocurrency’s success would eat into their own) had begun shutting down crypto brokerage accounts.      Without brokerage accounts, exchanges such as Nox Bitcoin could not easily provide cash on and off ramps to their customers. Founder João Paulo Oliveira said Banco Bradesco closed his brokerage account.      Banco Bradesco declined to comment on CADE proceedings.      It was a pattern rippling across Brazil’s crypto landscape, said Furlan, who as CEO of ABCB first called for a CADE investigation in April 2018.      Furlan said the banks would swoop in and close accounts “without any justification whatsoever.” He said their collective cold shoulder was a broadside to Brazil’s growing crypto industry.      “No company, no enterprise can survive in capitalism without access to the financial system,” Furlan said.    Competition    Itaú Unibanco denied allegations it acted anti-competitively.      Itaú “has always guided its commercial practices based on the defense of free initiative and competition, as well as the understanding that competition is positive not only for the financial system, but for the whole country,” a spokesperson told CoinDesk.      There does not appear to be any evidence the banks coordinated their decisions, Furlan said. A previous CADE official said none of them wielded individual market power, according to Furlan. These are usually two hallmarks of anti-competitive case law.      Indeed, Furlan said, a different CADE official’s December 2019 attempt to drop the case partly rested on the banks’ individual inability to control the market.      Furlan said it was a distinction without a difference. Four of the banks involved in the inquiry rank among the five-largest in all of Brazil. CADE said that in 2017, a year before its own investigation began, the six banks together held over 80% of Brazilian deposits.      The other argument Furlan said the first CADE ruling drew from was the banks’ stated fear that crypto brokers would expose them to money laundering.      Members of the crypto business landscape reject that claim.      “We do a better job in checking the legitimacy of the money we touch than banks and government agencies,” said Fabiano Dias, vice president of LATAM operations for the crypto payroll company Bitwage.      “For us crypto businesses, I know I can speak for our partners in Brazil on that too, we are confident in our [know-your-customer] procedures, making sure we are only enabling legit professionals, helping them to add efficiency to their payments and finances,” he said.      Furlan and ABCB appealed the decision. The appeal was denied. But on May 13, Prado said money laundering was not a good enough reason to lock out the crypto brokers in her call to continue the inquiry.      Crypto’s nascency was actually an argument for letting such businesses in, she wrote.      “In order to avoid the risk of pushing independent crypto asset brokers into a ‘limbo’ of the financial system (which could even increase the risks related to money laundering), CADE must exercise its duty to protect competition in this growing market,” she wrote.    Next steps    Itaú, the second-largest bank in Brazil and the only one to respond to CoinDesk’s questions before Wednesday’s ruling, said it “remains confident that its conduct will be considered legal and valid.”      “If the investigation is reopened, the bank will continue to collaborate with CADE in the necessary clarifications,” an Itaú spokesperson said at the time (the spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment after the ruling).      Oliviera, the Brazilian exchange founder, thinks the sanctioning argument only failed previously because its proponent, ABCB, “was funded exclusively and controlled by” Atlas Quantum, an alleged crypto ponzi scheme.      (Furlan’s April 2018 letter to CADE highlights that Atlas, an ABCB member, was denied a bank account by Banco do Brasil).      “I do believe that relations between ABCB and Atlas were considered for CADE to have decided that there's no competition conflict for banks to close bank accounts of crypto business,” Oliviera said.      Furlan told CoinDesk that ABCB has 39 members but acknowledged that the organization “has not been very active” since its main contributor ran into regulatory trouble with Brazil’s SEC.

42383791,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9yYFT,1589985899,"Steem Hard Fork Confiscates $6.3M, Community Immediately Takes It Back","The Steem blockchain has just split, or hard forked, controversially seizing the tokens of key community members who opposed TRON's recent acquisition of the ecosystem's biggest dapp, Steemit.      At 14:00 UTC on Tuesday, Steem implemented hard fork 0.23, significantly codenamed ""New Steem,"" shunting some of the former Steem ""witnesses"" – blockchain validators – and stakeholders who created a splinter group called HIVE out of the ecosystem, it seems for good.      New Steem, which was only announced on Monday, will ""seize some user accounts that participated in criminal activities by actively contributing to the threat against the Steem blockchain and/or to the theft of STEEM holders' assets,"" said a Steemit blog post, announcing the fork.      The hard fork's GitHub page lists all of the users who will have their tokens seized: 64 in total. A letter sent on Tuesday by a legal firm representing affected members – calling on exchanges to not support the hard fork – says a total of 23.6 million steem tokens will be seized – worth roughly $6.3 million at press time, according to CoinGecko.      One affected community member, Dan Hensley, told CoinDesk in an email he's losing around $1 million worth of steem as a result of the fork.      See also:Steemit Sets Up Shop on Tron Network      The hard fork is the latest episode in an ongoing struggle for control of the Steem blockchain. It began soon after Justin Sun's TRON Foundation acquired Steemit – Steem's most prominent dapp – for an undisclosed sum back in February.      Concerned Sun would use Steemit's sizeable token allocation to run roughshod over the rest of the community, the Steemit ecosystem quickly executed a soft fork that effectively nullified its voting power. A few weeks later, it implemented a splinter blockchain, HIVE, that duplicated over all tokens from Steem.      However, the allocations owned by Sun and some incumbent witnesses, around 83.2 million STEEM tokens in total, were immediately confiscated and stored in a separate wallet. The Steemit post says the exclusion of selected Steem players from HIVE was illegal and a ""clear violation of the property rights of STEEM holders.""      While Sun himself has denied any involvement in the hard fork, on Monday he claimed he was working with law enforcement to recover his confiscated HIVE tokens.      See also: Tron’s Takeover of Steemit Is Internet History Repeating Itself      It's hard not to see the New Steem hard fork as an example of a tit-for-tat move. But that's not how it was phrased. One current Steem witness known only as ""Triple A"" told a Korean news site the HIVE dissenters' tokens were seized, not because its own assets had been seized, but because these select accounts had ""continued to attack the Steem blockchain ecosystem.""      These include allegations that HIVE members have damaged network stability, spread fake news about the blockchain – picked up by the ""misleading media,"" according to Sun – and generally tried to discredit and besmirch the Steem community's name. Triple A also claimed some HIVE members were guilty of verbally abusing community users and even ""threatening murder.""      Emotions are fraught. Echoing Triple A's comments, the Steemit blog post states: ""The Steem blockchain has been under constant attack from malicious accounts and this has heavily influenced user experience, dapps usability, and the stability of the chain itself.""      Its post goes onto say that Steem witnesses who helped implement HIVE's ""hostile split action"" had effectively ""betrayed STEEM holders.""      See also: Why Crypto Should Care About Justin Sun’s Steem Drama      That's not how affected Steem users see it, though. The legal letter calls the fork a ""planned theft"" and threatens legal action against any exchanges that voted in favor of it. ""[Y]ou may become an accessory to criminal offences including grand larceny and securities fraud as well as expose yourself to civil liability for damages,"" the letter warns.      It's probably unlikely exchanges such as Binance and Huobi, some of Steem's largest stakeholders, will want to involve themselves in this dispute. Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, who was initially supportive of the takeover, recently washed his hands of it. ""We didn't know it was, like, a contentious fork,"" he said in an interview with Laura Shin at Ethereal Summit.      ""Every Steem witness that is human has quit. Justin denies involvement with the heist yet replaces the witnesses that quit with a sock puppet minutes later to do his bidding. Exchanges are the last line of defense,"" Hensley said.      There remain unanswered questions: chief among them is what happens to the seized steem tokens. The letter says these will be transferred to a new wallet account, ""@community321."" Set up just under two weeks ago, what entity actually runs or owns the account has yet to be revealed.      Soon after the fork, it was claimed the tokens had been moved en masse to the Bittrex exchange in an attempt to return them to their original owners. The Steem Witness Twitter account seemed to confirm the news, but pledged the ""assets will be recovered.""

42383766,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9yYN1,1589984171,Facebook’s Toothless Oversight Board Has Lessons for Blockchain,"Cathy Barrera, a CoinDesk columnist, is a founding economist at Prysm Group, an economic advisory group, and was chief economist at ZipRecruiter. She has a PhD in business economics from Harvard.      On May 6, Facebook announced the members of its new oversight board. They include a Nobel Laureate, a former Prime Minister, judges, journalists, and academics. The response was decidedly lukewarm.      In January, when Facebook announced the board's by-laws, critics asserted they did not go far enough in giving power to the board. More bluntly, some critics declared the board toothless.      With this latest announcement, it is clear the by-laws are not what will be enforcing the decisions of the board. Instead, the reputation of the board's members will do the heavy lifting. Members of the board risk damage to their reputations if they appear to be bending to Facebook's will. At the same time, Mark Zuckerberg will face a hell-storm of angry users if he goes back on his commitment to implementing the board's decisions.      See also: MakerDAO's Problems Are a Textbook Case of Governance Failure      It seems a missed opportunity that such an esteemed group has to rely on these types of informal enforcement mechanisms to get their will enacted. Could a better-constructed set of by-laws have fixed this problem? In short, no. No other set of rules could have provided the board with more formal power than it has in this situation.      The reason for this is an economic concept called contractual incompleteness. All blockchain and DLT projects should understand this concept and the limitations it puts on formal governance.      Economics tells us that who owns an asset – in the above case, Facebook's platform and network – is just as important as contracts and agreements when it comes to making governance decisions regarding that asset. The Board and Facebook might agree to delegate some decisions to the Board under specified circumstances. However, it is impossible to predict every situation that could arise in the future and write a contract that covers all of them. This is the essence of incompleteness. When a situation arises that was not anticipated in the agreement, Facebook – the owner – gets to decide what to do. So, no matter the contents of the contract, rules, or by-laws, the owner will always have more control than other parties to the agreement.      Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia, summed it up well in the Guardian: ""The power of Facebook is its ability to choose what everyone sees."" Whoever owns the platform and network has the power. And in this case, that control remains with Facebook.    Facebook's inability to create a genuinely independent body with real control over content decisions is an essential lesson for blockchain projects.    This concept has broad implications for how organizations and markets are structured. Oliver Hart won the Nobel Prize in 2016 for his work in this area. Those implications are equally relevant to blockchain projects as they are to Facebook.      Blockchain projects – whether permissionless or permissioned – attempt to redistribute power and control in order to overcome a single point of failure, circumvent intermediaries, or reduce hold up. Multiple nodes (hardware assets) owned by different entities each independently maintain the shared ledger with the assistance of a consensus mechanism. Each node owner has control over its hardware, but not over the shared ledger itself.      Since the node operators own the hardware that maintains the ledger, they naturally play an outsized role in governance. No matter the process used to make a governance decision or who is involved in that process, if the node owners do not want to implement that decision, it will not be implemented. Projects or consortia that include other non-node entities in the governance process will face the same challenges as Facebook's oversight board. Informal mechanisms will be required to assist formal governance rules to ensure decisions are implemented in an orderly manner.      For blockchain projects, intellectual property (IP) ownership is even more important than hardware ownership. One of the critical decisions any enterprise blockchain consortium will make early on is how to address the IP rights over its software. We typically recommend that the most crucial elements of the network's software be made open source specifically to avoid the type of governance problem Facebook is now facing. Giving ownership control of essential IP assets to a single member is at odds with the decentralization benefits of using DLT and poses governance risks for the consortium.      See also: Libra's Long Road From a Facebook Lab to the Global Stage: A Timeline      It is possible to design governance rules and ownership allocation of nodes and IP rights in a way that distributes power effectively. Doing so requires understanding the participants in the consortium and the degree to which they currently wield power in the industries and markets in which they operate. Participants may have ongoing relationships outside the network that make them want to cooperate with each other as consortium partners. Like Facebook, a company’s commitment to certain actions may be reinforced by its reputation with its customers. These issues will impact the final design of the consortium’s governance.      Facebook's inability to create a genuinely independent body with real control over content decisions is an essential lesson for blockchain projects. Blockchain projects have an advantage that Facebook lacks; IP and hardware ownership rights can be allocated purposefully in order to optimize the distribution of power. However, even with these additional tools, distributing power is challenging, and the results will not be perfect.      The key to achieving the best outcomes possible is to utilize agreements and rules to target gaps left by ownership rights, accept the limitations of these formal tools, and embrace the role that informal mechanisms, such as reputation, can play. The ultimate governance design of a project will depend on the existing relationships and reputations of the parties involved in the project.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Cathy Barrera,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/05/20/facebooks-toothless-oversight-board-has-lessons-for-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b7af576d3ec8ee1cec75711c06a3df3f93b6198c-1780x1335.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Organized by the Value Technology Foundation think tank and co-authored by a smattering of private sector tech companies, consultancies and blockchain firms, the briefing offers a sobering analysis of that race as it stands.      “The two superpowers that pose the greatest threat to the U.S. are both heavily investing in both the research and development of blockchain technology,” the briefing said: China’s on the “economic warfare” offensive with its digital currency. Russia is on defense with a lab dedicated to blockchain cyber threat mitigation.      The U.S. needs to similarly bootstrap its blockchain and DLT warfighter readiness, and it stands to benefit as soon as it does, the briefing said. In addition to AWS, IBM and Deloitte, the paper was written by Accenture, CGI Federal, ConsenSys, SIMBA Chain and Colvin Run Networks.      In cybersecurity, blockchain could broadly assist the military in anything from “weapons release” to stopping data erasure, an impossible proposition for append only databases. But it could also bolster command and control mechanisms through multi-party authentication.      If multiple parties hold command authority, and they must reach consensus to act, then the system could be made more secure with blockchain, the group wrote. This could have specific benefits for the U.S. military’s newest branch: the Space Force.      Blockchain could contribute to the Space Force by adding multi-factor authentication to satellite communication systems, the group wrote. Such systems are generally insecure, and according to the report they’ve been exploited or proven vulnerable before with issues that DLT could fix.      “An attacker would need to gain control over an arbitrary number of user accounts and be able to use those accounts to perform actions on the blockchain in order to confirm an inappropriate command,” the report said.      They advocated for DLT in the military supply chain with the same logistics playbook that civilian blockchain boosters hawk: identifying counterfeit goods verification, tracing provenance, keeping the food supply safe during a recall, sourcing commodities. All have defense department applications, according to the report.      But the military supply chain has already begun implementing DLT. The report documented a handful of blockchain trials in defense aerospace, aircraft parts additive manufacturing and naval engineering contracts.

42383759,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9yYED,1589979600,Blockchain Sleuthing Firm Elliptic Adds 87 Crypto Assets in Arms Race With Chainalysis,"Crypto sleuthing firm Elliptic has expanded its scope to cover some 97% of digital assets by trading volume – the broadest range of any crime-fighting blockchain analytics service, the company said.      Announced Wednesday, Elliptic Navigator adds 87 new crypto assets to the firm’s existing purview.      That said, touting just the number of coins covered can be “fairly irrelevant,” said Elliptic co-founder Tom Robinson, because analytics shops could be including many ERC-20 tokens that nobody really uses.      “More important is the proportion of all trading volume your supported assets cover,” said Robinson. “We now support just over 97% of all assets by trading volume, the broadest of any crypto transaction screening tool.”      That figure beats the competition, Robinson said. Chainalysis has said it covers 90% and Ciphertrace has said it covers 87%.      It's increasingly becoming a regulatory expectation that crypto businesses have transaction screening capabilities across all the assets they support. Because exchanges have sought out new customers and revenue, the number of assets they support has grown rapidly.      Read more: Coronavirus Has Erased 33% of Crypto Scammers’ Revenue: Chainalysis      On this occasion, Elliptic added a swathe of new tokens and stablecoins in one go, all of them based on the Ethereum ERC-20 standard. Elliptic also adds some tokens individually, as it recently did with Stellar.      Robinson said stablecoin adoption, in particular, has exploded this year. Elliptic can now track tether (USDT), TrueUSD (TUSD), USD Coin (USDC), Gemini Dollar (GUSD), Paxos Standard (PAX), dai and Binance USD (BUSD).      “Elliptic is the clear leader in crypto transaction screening,” Binance Chief Compliance Officer Samuel Lim said in a statement. “Support for BUSD in their compliance products will help us to increase adoption for our stablecoin and maintain regulatory compliance.”    Crooked coins    In terms of which cryptocurrencies attract the most nefarious activity, Robinson said darkweb transactions are dominated by bitcoin and monero. With some of the other cryptocurrencies, such as XRP and stellar (XLM), illicit activity is less about trade or purchases, and more about scams or Ponzi schemes.      “We saw a similar type of distribution with a lot of the new tokens we are adding,” said Robinson. “It’s more about fraud than any kind of dark market activity; there are no dark marketplaces accepting payment in an obscure ICO token.”      Stablecoins tend to be involved in relatively little illicit or fraudulent activity, said Robinson, probably because the issuers have the functionality to freeze accounts or reverse payments in a given stablecoin.      Read more: Stablecoin Supply Breaks $10B as Traders Demand Dollars Over Bitcoin      On the subject of privacy coins, Robinson said monero, with its belt-and-braces approach to privacy features, would be “extremely challenging” to add to Elliptic’s roster of supported assets. “It’s not something we are targeting at the moment,” he said.      “Something like zcash has dual modes of operating either shielded or non-shielded transactions,” Robinson said. “So, we are going to add support for zcash unshielded transactions to Navigator.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING | BNB,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/05/20/blockchain-sleuthing-firm-elliptic-adds-87-crypto-assets-in-arms-race-with-chainalysis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e7633170674e1ef8adf6add092db0521e120d7d8-2000x1488.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383773,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9yYS3,1589976207,Staking Will Turn Ethereum Into a Functional Store of Value,"Osho Jha is an investor, data scientist and tech company executive who enjoys finding and analyzing unique data sets for investing in both public and private markets.      With the halving capturing the attention of most investors in the cryptocurrency space as well as some mainstream press, the changes at Ethereum have gone largely unnoticed in the broader crypto community. While BTC has become an investment option for those seeking strong money principles in a time of central bank balance sheet expansion, ETH also represents strong money principles. Ethereum 2.0 has been plagued by delays – a natural part of the software development process but a primary cause of negative sentiment towards ETH. However, Ethereum 2.0 seeks to change from a PoW infrastructure to a PoS infrastructure and the magnitude of this shift, I believe, is not reflected in the price of the token.    ETH deflation - A look at supply-side dynamics    Before diving into the impact that staking could have on ETH, it is important to understand how the ETH “money supply” currently works. As we know, BTC has a fixed supply of 21 million coins and the rate at which these coins are released into the money supply decreases over time. ETH does not have a fixed supply but, like BTC, it has a declining inflation rate:      There is a fixed issuance of new ETH annually. As the money supply grows, that fixed issuance becomes a smaller portion of the total money supply. As with BTC halvings, ETH over time has reduced the block reward for miners. The transition to Ethereum 2.0’s staking mechanism is set to reduce the inflation rate of ETH to 0.5%-2.0%, putting it in the same company as BTC and gold in terms of supply inflation.      I look at ETH as the fiat to BTC’s gold. Despite negative connotations in the crypto community, fiat currencies aren’t inherently bad and the main advantage of an unfixed total supply is flexibility to adjust supply during different economic climates. Central banks have taken this flexibility to an extreme in recent years, and, while ETH’s supply is not fixed, its projected long term inflation may be a happy middle ground between fixed supply and unbridled money printing.    ETH staking - A look at demand-side dynamics    In many ways, ETH trades like a venture investment. Investors believe Ethereum will be the underlying technology for the future of decentralized apps and they buy ETH in the same way they would shares. I find this troubling because, by its very nature, ETH is not a stock and these investors are taking on a bigger risk than they might think.      Staking is the key to making ETH function as a value store. At its core, staking incentivizes holding ETH in a node that can then be used by the network to verify transactions. The greater the number of nodes, the faster the network can function and the more secure it becomes. Staking is not new. Projects ranging from Hedera Hashgraph to Facebook Libra have some sort of staking mechanism built in. But they don’t have the advantage of being the de facto network decentralized app developers lean on.    The magnitude of this shift, I believe, is not reflected in the price of the token.    For investors, there are incentives to staking tokens in a node, including rewards similar to earning interest on a bank deposit. While the staking rewards vary based on network performance and utilization, target returns are close to 10% annually. Though actual returns will vary as the network gets up and running, the possibility of earning returns on coins that would otherwise be in a wallet should entice ETH holders to stake.      In a global low-rate environment, these returns are certainly attractive. And staking may be the killer app that allows ETH to become a “positive carry asset.” In other words, it generates a positive return for holding it as opposed to, say, gold, which is negative-carry, as it incurs storage costs. Long term, positive carry stimulates demand and creates an incentive to borrow cash to purchase and earn yield. Overall, positive-carry assets increase stability of price movements by creating long term holders and widening the investor base.      Investors are becoming aware of this dynamic. To stake a node, there is a minimum required 32 ETH (thought staking pools can allow staking to be done with as little as 1 ETH). The following chart shows the growth in Ethereum addresses holding 32 or more ETH tokens:    Usage – Stablecoins and DeFi    While generating interest income from staking will certainly be positively received by investors, network usage is ultimately what will create a sustainable system and long-term growth in ETH value.      Investors often consider network usage in the context of dapp adoption and transactions being done, but this misses a big part of the ethereum story. Stablecoins and DeFi have an outsized usage of ETH.      Stablecoins are currently near an all time high total market cap spurred by the broader liquidity crisis in March 2020. This has, in turn, pushed ETH transaction counts to highs around the level seen in summer of 2019.      DeFi is a large source of utilization as well with total USD value locked up in DeFi crossing $1bln USD earlier this year:    ETH as a Store of Value    Current events have forced us to adapt to a more digital life and also shown us the limitation of legacy banking systems. Even the distribution of stimulus checks became a nontrivial problem. With the market focused on bitcoin and its role in unstable economic times, the advances being set forth by Ethereum 2.0 have been largely overlooked. However, Ethereum 2.0 lays out a platform which can help create better digital experiences and ease the friction as individuals and institutions transition to a digital-first world.      As we mentioned earlier, staking will turn ETH into a positive carry asset, which in turn brings price stability and broadens the investor base. By staking accumulated tokens, investors will both earn yield and help scale the network in a secure way.      While ETH is being staked, there is demand for stablecoins and banking-esque services, which are being deployed and iterated on in the DeFi space as a whole. With this dynamic, transactions can be made using stablecoins while ETH itself is staked to generate interest income. This may sound foreign and futuristic but it’s not much different than when people keep savings in an interest-generating savings accounts, or investments, and keep day-to-day money in a checking account.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | TRADING,Osho Jha,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/20/staking-will-turn-ethereum-into-a-functional-store-of-value,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1239cea73df91cc0c3e493e1946cdd1177810950-1200x787.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383774,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9yYTJ,1589975693,"First Mover: Bitcoin Just Got Easier to Mine, but for How Long?","Bitcoin's mining ""difficulty"" has undergone its first adjustment since last week's halving, dropping the figure by 6%.      Mining difficulty is part of an automatic procedure that takes place on the Bitcoin blockchain every 2,016 data blocks, or roughly every two weeks. The mechanism is supposed to help keep the blockchain network humming along steadily: When computational power flags, the difficulty of finding new bitcoins automatically adjusts downward, helping to restore miners' profitability and encouraging them to crank their machines back up.      You're reading First Mover, CoinDesk's daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      That's what happened on Tuesday when the mechanism automatically responded to the miner shakeout that took place following last week's quadrennial halving on the blockchain. In the halving, the number of new bitcoin produced with every data block got cut in half, so it took a steep toll on miners' profitability.      A drop in mining difficulty theoretically favors miners that have remained in the game. With less competition from the miners that got shaken out, they stand to benefit from a newly improved chance of winning freshly minted bitcoin.      But a drop in difficulty can also make obsolete equipment profitable again.      A report Tuesday from data firm Coin Metrics found many of Bitmain's Antminer S9s bitcoin-mining computers, which saw their heyday in 2018, powered up in response to bitcoin's recent price increase past $9,000. The halving made them less profitable, but the easing in mining difficulty should help to improve margins.      It doesn't hurt that the S9s are available at rock-bottom prices on the secondary market, from $20 to $80. With such a tiny capital investment, the only real consideration is whether revenue from mining exceeds the costs, primarily electricity.      The dynamic shows “the degree to which mining with old hardware may be viable given favorable conditions, and the ease with which this less-expensive hardware can be deployed,” according to Coin Metrics.      Due to what has been generally an ever-increasing amount of computational power on the network, bitcoin’s mining difficulty has almost always trended upwards. That's not to say there haven't been dips, such as the precipitous drop at the end of 2018, after as many as 800,000 miners turned off their rigs following deep price drops.      But the current difficulty is still well over double what it was this time last year – a sign of just how competitive the mining business has become.      At bitcoin's current price of $9,776 and using the latest Antminer S19 Pro, a single miner paying the U.S. average electricity price of $0.13 per kWH could expect a profit of $0.97 a day, according to profit calculator NiceHash.      So unless there’s a meteoric price rise, a subsequent increase in difficulty would quickly erase the incremental profit miners gained from Tuesday's difficulty dip.  And if the chart above is anything to go by, that’s only a matter of when, not if.      Taken alone, the dynamic shows that, while the network's design comes with temporary adjustment mechanisms to help keep miners on the network, it's ultimately bitcoin's market price that's most influential in fattening their profit margins.      More broadly, some observers of the network worry that there's no end to the longer-term trend of bitcoin mining power consolidating in a handful of major entities. These stronger hands have enough capital to buy equipment, enough equipment to assure steady revenues, the ability to purchase electricity at wholesale prices and the fall-back resources to weather market downturns.      Negative adjustments happen infrequently. According to CoinDesk's Zack Voell, there have only been 49 in the protocol's history.      With total network hash rate down 20%, it's possible mining difficulty could well fall again at the next adjustment date in two week's time.      But Tuesday's drop in mining difficulty will likely will prove a blip in that longer-term trend, and bitcoin’s mining power will continue to consolidate. Ultimately, many of the smaller hobby miners who once dominated the network will get priced out.      Earlier this year, pseudonymous crypto analyst Hasu argued in an op-ed for CoinDesk that although the concentration of mining power was “inevitable,” it wasn’t necessarily all bad.      In fact, greater concentration was “harmless, as attacks on bitcoin incur an opportunity cost that scales with the amount of hash power an attack controls,” he said. “An attacker with a lot of hash power would incur a large cost.”      Tuesday's difficulty adjustment might help keep those S9 machines online for just a little while longer.      Eventually, though, only a rocketing bitcoin price would be enough to save them.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $9,750 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,899 | 24-Hr Low: $9,577      Trend: Bitcoin is trapped in a narrow trading range between $9,450 and $10,000 for the third straight day.      Technical indicators and on-chain metrics favor a range breakout, or a sustained move into five figures, however. For instance, the 50-day and 200-day averages are about to produce a golden crossover, a long-term bull market indicator.      Further, the weekly chart MACD histogram and the relative strength index are reporting bullish conditions, validating last week's violation of the descending trendline connecting the June 2019 and February 2020 highs.      Meanwhile, the number of bitcoins held on exchanges has dropped to 2,324,674, the lowest level since May 20, 2019, according to data provided by blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode. The metric has declined by over 11% in the past two months and indicates strong holding sentiment in the investor community.      The Puell Multiple, too, has declined to levels below 0.50, indicating the cryptocurrency is undervalued. The metric is calculated by dividing the daily issuance value of bitcoins in U.S. dollar terms by the 365-day moving average of the daily issuance value.      A range breakout, if confirmed, would likely yield a move toward $10,500 (February high). A violation there would invalidate the lower-highs pattern seen on the weekly chart and strengthen the case for a re-test of the 2019 high of $13,880.      Alternatively, if the buyers fail to defend the lower end of the trading range at $9,450, a deeper decline to the 50-week average support at $8,795 could be seen.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,"Paddy Baker, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/20/first-mover-bitcoin-just-got-easier-to-mine-but-for-how-long,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6873efb89c6b18654cdf0318f38e040cc64ff086-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383771,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9yYQn,1589974150,Bitcoin Options: Deribit Exchange Sees Record Open Interest of $1B,"Bitcoin’s option market continues to grow, signaling an increased influx of sophisticated traders and institutions into the crypto space.      Open interest (or open positions) in options listed on the Panama-based Deribit exchange jumped to a record high of $1 billion Tuesday, according to the data provided by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew. Each option contract on Deribit represents one bitcoin. On Tuesday, 101,000 options contracts were open on Deribit, the world's largest exchange by options trading volume.      “The new record is driven by market sentiment, an increased number of diverse global participants on Deribit and the efforts made by our various partners and us to provide a premier quality market at all times with the highest capital efficiency, integrity and connectivity and trading solution,” said Luuk Strijers, Deribit's chief commercial officer.      Options trading activity on the exchange has surged this year, as evidenced by a year-to-date gain of 270% in open interest. Daily trading volume hit two-month highs above $100 million last week and has increased by 170% this year.      Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specified date. A call option gives the holder the right to buy, while the put option gives the holder the right to sell.      “Options are one product that attract sophisticated traders,” Skew’s CEO Emmanuel Goh said at Consensus: Distributed on May 14. Big traders and institutions often use options to hedge long/short positions in the spot and futures markets.    Trading target    The growth in open interest is primarily being driven by options expiring next month. As of Wednesday, more than 40,000 contracts expiring on June 26, 2020, are open.      Open interest is relatively low for options expiring in September and December. That’s because longer-duration options are more expensive. “Over time you will see a pickup in September or December,” said Strijers.    Driving growth    Options are more complicated than futures contracts because their price depends on a variety of factors like volatility, time to expiration, a risk-free interest rate and so on. Further, options tend to lose value as expiry nears.      The pricing of futures contracts is relatively easier to understand. As a result, futures are more popular and usually see higher open interest than options. However, in Deribit’s case, options activity is much higher.      Currently, there are $1.36 billion worth of open positions in bitcoin and ether derivative contracts (futures and options) listed on Deribit, of which nearly 74% is being derived from bitcoin options.      Open positions in options listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), widely considered to be synonymous with institutional demand, rose to a new lifetime high of $174 million on Tuesday.      Investor interest began rising ahead of bitcoin’s mining reward halving on May 11 and has continued to surge ever since. Notably, the metric hit record highs for three consecutive days after the event.      While activity in options continues to rise, it's difficult to gauge whether investors are selling or buying calls/puts. ""Those are two possibilities, although we cannot know for sure. However, implied volatility is relatively stable in the last few days suggesting the flows might be balanced,"" said Skew's Goh.      Bitcoin is currently trading near $9,700. The cryptocurrency has been largely restricted to the trading range of $8,100–$10,000 since the halving.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/20/bitcoin-options-deribit-exchange-sees-record-open-interest-of-1b,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dbf979825e910e315d3b5a1ebef6432093fa9534-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383764,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9yYJF,1589966872,Aeternity Blockchain Launches P2P Content Tipping Project 'Superhero',"A new platform dubbed Superhero will allow users including artists and musicians to boost exposure to their content and receive tips in the form of tokens – all while keeping their personal data private.      Launched Wednesday on Aeternity, an open-source public blockchain, the Superhero project is a decentralized peer-to-peer social sharing initiative for tipping, patronage and sponsoring user content or digital goods.      Artists, developers, educators, medical groups, environmentalists and non-profits are just some of the wide-ranging groups that are being eyed as potentially benefiting from the Superhero platform. Donations for quality content can be sent to the creator without needing to share third party data or pay transaction fees to a middleman, Aeternity said.      Users will need to install the Superhero wallet as a browser extension to receive or send tips to URL addresses they want to support.      See also: You Can Now Tip on Twitter With Brave’s Basic Attention Token      The platform also includes a widget that can be directly embedded into a website for the purpose of collecting €5, €10, or €15 vouchers of Aeternity's AE token, which can be purchased via PayPal, BitPay or JellySwap, a type of peer-to-peer trade across different blockchains. The swap currently supports bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), dai, USDC or wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) to AE, with no further know-your-customer (KYC) requirements.      “Now more than ever, we believe in the mission of empowering people to support other people,” said Yanislav Malahov, founder of Aeternity.      “Content monetization has historically been a tug-of-war between third party advertisers, data thieves, host platforms and lastly the creators themselves. Superhero is putting the control back in the hands of the people, making it easier than ever to support creators from every industry,"" Malahov said.

42383769,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9yYPX,1589964701,Team Behind Bitcoin-Backed Ethereum Token tBTC Explains Shutdown,"Keep Network says a flawed code addition forced the shutdown of its bitcoin-backed Ethereum token, tBTC, just two days after it launched.      On May 18, deposits of bitcoin into tBTC were paused for 10 days – a move prompted by a bug that was supposedly missed by a security audit and was later found by two of the network's contributors.      That bug, Keep Network revealed in a Medium blog post Wednesday, related to a flaw in the processing of deposit redemptions (when users try and pull bitcoin back out of the system), essentially due to the code's inability to tell different types of bitcoin addresses apart.      ""The team triggered this pause after finding a significant issue in the redemption flow of deposit contracts that put signer bonds for open deposits at risk of liquidation when certain types of bitcoin addresses were used in redemption,"" Keep Network, which is behind the Thesis project that launched the token, said in the post.      The team noted that redemptions had originally been restricted to p2wpkh address outputs, but were later widened to include ""any other output scripts."" The issue arose if a user tried to redeem pay-to-scripthash (p2sh) addresses. This changed code had not been specifically tested, bar more generally on testnets at a later stage, the post concedes.      ""[D]ue to a bug in the redemption dApp in use at the time, the proof step of the redemption flow never occurred,"" Keep Network wrote. ""These p2sh addresses would have failed validation had the proof step occurred, but reliance on the dApp’s display of a completed state meant the team assumed the redemption had completed successfully, when it in fact had not.""      Also read: Blockfolio Quietly Patches Years-Old Security Hole That Exposed Source Code      A second bug was also found meaning that, even if the proof code had been free of issues, a ""malicious redeemer"" could have specified an output script that resulted in an invalid bitcoin transaction.      Community manager at Blockstream, Daniel Williams, who has an interest in bitcoin and goes by the handle, @Grubles, critically summed up the primary bug in a May 20 tweet, saying:      While the bug and subsequent pause have been a setback for the Thesis team, a new call out has been made to solicit help from code auditors to help track down any further issues.      ""We're also in the market for BTC-focused auditors for round 3,"" the team said a Tweet on Wednesday.      See also: Makers of Keep Protocol Raise $7.7M to Bring Trustless BTC to DeFi      In addition to technical and process changes, the Thesis team will be announcing how it plans on approaching a ""redeploy of the tBTC system"" and how that will impact existing plans around the KEEP token distribution.

Starting Friday, Amazon Prime will offer the documentary “Banking on Africa: The Bitcoin Revolution,” made by South African filmmaker Tamarin Gerriety with sponsorship from the crypto exchange Luno. It features industry heavyweights including SatoshiCentre founder Alakanani Itireleng in Botswana and South African monero developer Riccardo Spagni. The film shows how vastly different their lives are, from a Botswanian goat farm to Spagni’s urban rooftop and drone.      So far, it appears Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya and Ghana are home to the fastest-growing communities of bitcoin users on the continent.      A January 2020 report by the market research firm DataReportal estimated 11% of Nigerians and 13% of South Africans under the age of 64 with internet access own cryptocurrency, compared to the 7% global average.      One such bitcoiner, Nigerian entrepreneur Keith Mali, bought his first bitcoin in 2016, dropped out of university in 2018 and has been giving lectures at schools across the region about bitcoin ever since. He’s also the founder of the social media startup Swirge.      “Cryptos have a higher chance of growth [in Nigeria] compared to the West ... especially for cross-border remittances,” Mali said. “We just launched our public beta during this pandemic and we’ve grown beyond 20,000 users, with no initial coin offering.”      “People are looking at ways to diversify their incomes,” he added.      See also: In Zimbabwe, Crypto Is a ‘Liberation Tool’: Bitcoin in Africa, Part 1 of a New Documentary Podcast Series      Likewise, a Nigerian BuyCoins user named Nnanna Ijezie said he and many of his friends use multiple accounts, including Luno, Coinbase and BuyCoins, to convert a portion of their salaries into bitcoin for savings. Nigerians who travel or have family abroad also use bitcoin for remittances, he said. Exchanges are predominately used for buying, while social media groups for traders are used for liquidation.      “Anyone in Nigeria for the past five years has experienced devaluation at least twice … so [bitcoin’s] volatility is a trade-off people are willing to make,” Ijezie said. “But most of the trading is happening offline. … In Nigeria, the market is also tied to the strength of the diaspora population.”      BuyCoins, Binance and Luno all see lucrative traction in Nigeria. This week Luno’s research partner, Arcane Research, issued a report to complement the “Banking on Africa” film. The report said Luno’s four million users, primarily in South Africa but also including many Nigerians, are inspired by inflation concerns, political instability and scant access to affordable financial services. They transact $4.5 million worth of cryptocurrency every day.      Data from both Arcane Research and peer-to-peer exchanges indicate traction in Ghana and Kenya is also surging.    Kenya    Entrepreneurial bitcoin educator Michael Kimani in Kenya said he is running a class of 25 people, paying $200 each for 2.5 hours for five weeks. It’s his third class since last November.      “The classes are mostly equally representative, roughly half of them are women,” Kimani said, describing his educational project Crypto Baraza. “What’s driving their interest is the fact that our economy could be heading south. The students coming to my class are looking to escape the economy, they are looking for alternatives. Bitcoin is that.”      Read more: Why Binance and Akon Are Betting on Africa for Crypto Adoption      Like so many African bitcoiners, Kimani is a freelancer juggling several jobs. In addition to research and technical services, he runs the Blockchain Association of Kenya, a nonprofit think-tank comparable to the Coin Center in Washington, D.C. He prefers using over-the-counter groups on WhatsApp rather than exchanges like Luno.      “The groups I’m on are like 120 or 150 people in each. I didn’t start getting paid in it [bitcoin] until recently. I’ve never paid for anything in it,” Kimani said, describing how he uses bitcoin.      He added his students generally aren’t attracted to bitcoin for philosophical reasons, nor any aversion to central banks. Instead, they want to use it.      “Many of the students in my class will tell you their first experience with crypto was a scam or a bitcoin mining scheme,” Kimani said. “I’ve seen schemes like this as far back as 2014. Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana, we’ve gone through the scam cycles and came out with higher volumes.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | RESEARCH | BNB | TOKEN SALE,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/20/this-bitcoin-documentary-from-africa-is-streaming-on-amazon-prime,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2a1c3cf45fc3ca10ef6f6e0ff2cb003bc9b93008-1500x817.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383757,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9yYBh,1589947200,Square Unveils Bitcoin Auto Payments Tool,"A mobile subsidiary of Jack Dorsey's payments company Square now allows users to make automatic purchases of bitcoin.      Dorsey said on Twitter - that other company he runs – that Cash App had, from Monday, enabled automatic purchases of bitcoin at regular intervals, such as daily, weekly or fortnightly.      Although there's a minimum $10 purchase, the new feature provides users with the ability to gradually gain exposure to the original cryptocurrency without exposing themselves to too much volatility risk. ""By spreading purchases out over time, you may minimize the impact of market swings,"" Cash App tweeted.      See also: Jack Dorsey’s Square Wins Patent for Fiat-to-Crypto Payments Network      Cash App launched to facilitate app-to-app payments in fiat currencies. Rolling out bitcoin trading in the summer of 2019, and allowing users to deposit BTC the following June, the company disclosed earlier this year that just under half its total revenue, around $178 million, came from bitcoin purchases in Q4 2019.      First-time bitcoin buyers on the platform doubled in Q3 2019.      But one thing that stands out in the screenshot shared by Dorsey is that users now have the option to set up automatic purchases denominated in satoshis which, at 0.00000001 of a bitcoin, is the protocol's smallest transaction unit.      That's important. Consider: At just under $10,000, a single bitcoin already prices out many retail investors; it's also comparatively scarce, with only 21 million in existence. In comparison: with more than 2.1 quadrillion satoshis knocking about, and at a current price of $0.0009, the 'sat' becomes accessible to a broader number of people, as adoption continues.      See also: Payments Unicorn Square Gets Limited Bank Charter for Merchant Lending      It might indicate a gradual trend for traders and investors to resort to a smaller unit of account in response to the Bitcoin protocol itself increasing in both size and value. A good comparison might be that few people, aside from the very wealthy, go around buying whole troy ounces of gold (~$1,7400) but generally much smaller denominations.

42383754,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9yY9B,1589940710,Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Drops by 6% in First Adjustment After Halving,"The bitcoin network just fine-tuned a key parameter to coax back miners who quit after last week's halving hammered their profits.      More than 20 exahashes per second (EH/s) of computing power – the equivalent of around 1.5 million older-generation mining machines – has been switched off from Bitcoin since the network's halving.      The seven-day rolling average of bitcoin's hashrate has dropped over 20% from around 122 EH/s just prior to the halving on May 11 to now 97 EH/s. The once-in-four-years event reduced miners' block rewards from 12.5 to 6.25 bitcoin (BTC) per block.      The hashrate drop after the halving has significantly outrun the hashing sprint prior to it. As such, bitcoin's mining difficulty, which measures how hard it is to compete for block rewards, decreased 6% to 15.14 Trillion at 2:00 UTC on Wednesday in the network's first biweekly difficulty adjustment since the halving.      The amount of computing power connected to bitcoin has been on a roller-coaster ride over the past two weeks.      Read more: Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Nears All-Time High in Final Adjustment Before Halving      Bitcoin's mining difficulty adjusts itself every 2,016 blocks, roughly 14 days, to ensure the average interval between blocks remains at 10 minutes. If a large number of miners are switched off from the network, resulting in a longer-than-10-minute average block interval, the difficulty will decrease to encourage participation.      And bitcoin's third halving on May 11 happened exactly at the halfway mark of the previous 2,016-block difficulty cycle.      ""We believe that, as the halving drew closer, miners in China did a sprint run of mining, even with older generation machines, to make most of the last days of the higher block rewards,"" said Kevin Zhang, director of blockchain strategies at Greenidge Generation, a New York-based natural gas power plant that mines bitcoin.      Alejandro De La Torre, vice president of the mining pool PoolIn, agreed that miners were switching on to mine as much as possible before the halving.      ""That's why we saw those sky-high hash rate figures,"" he said. But as the halving kicked in midway, he said, miners that were marginally profitable had to switch off.      Read more: Bitcoin Halving Arrives: Mining Rewards Drop for Third Time in History      According to miner profitability data tracked by PoolIn and F2Pool, at bitcoin's current price and difficulty old generations of miners won't be profitable with an electricity rate that's above $0.05 per kilowatt-hour.    Mitigating factors    That said, the drop in mining competition is helpful to those still in the game that have more efficient equipment and cheaper electricity since they can earn a bigger share of the 900 BTC minted every day.      With the difficulty adjustment, De La Torre expects some, but not all, of these miners to switch back on.      ""Consider also, the wet season in China is bringing the cost of electricity even lower,"" he said.      Read more: New York Power Plant Sells 30% of Its Bitcoin Mining Hashrate to Institutional Buyers      In a report released May 1, PoolIn estimated that the computing power contributed by miners at the ""lower quartile"" – older models that compute 0-25 terahashes per second – accounted for 15% to 30% of the network's total at the time.      ""While we expect most of these miners will shut down after the halving, it is likely that some of them have cheap enough electricity to survive in the near future,"" the firm said in the report.      As the summer rainy season approaches in China, mining farms in the country's southwestern provinces have been trying to attract customers with electricity rates as low as $0.03 per kilowatt-hour.      Following the halving, the total transaction fees paid to Bitcoin miners have also been on the rise, data shows. Apart from block rewards, miners earn fees that are attached to each transaction on the Bitcoin network.      Read more: BitMEX Is Making Bitcoin Network More Expensive for Everyone, Researcher Finds      Total daily network transaction fees have jumped from around 30 BTC at the end of April to over 160 BTC, and now account for roughly 17% of miners' daily revenue.      ""Another interesting observation we made is the significant rise of the transaction fees as a percentage of the block rewards. Yesterday, transaction fees comprised nearly a quarter of Greenidge's pool payouts,"" said Zhang. ""With this percentage currently in the range of 15-20%, it remains to be seen how this percentage may change and affect the incentive of miners.""",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | REGULATION,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/20/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-drops-by-6-in-first-adjustment-after-halving,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e56ff35b805cff8c22065a9e7544c46e1dd504de-994x687.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Brian Brooks, the first deputy comptroller and chief operating officer in the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), will become acting comptroller on May 29 after his boss, Joseph Otting, steps down from the role.      Otting will be stepping down after reforming rules designed to prevent financial institutions from discriminating against low-income and minority individuals, Politico Pro reported Tuesday, and he reportedly announced his resignation effective at the end of the month on Wednesday. The Wall Street Journal also reported Otting's plans.      Brooks, as the First Deputy, will take on the role of Acting Comptroller of the Currency until U.S. President Donald Trump nominates a permanent candidate and the U.S. Senate confirms them. The OCC is the only entity that charters national banks in the U.S.      See Also: Capitol Controls: From Coinbase to the OCC, How Brian Brooks Is Changing Regulation      It's unclear how long this process could take. Otting was nominated in June 2017 and confirmed in November 2017, indicating the process could take months.      Brooks took the role of First Deputy barely two months ago, but has already announced his support of a charter that would allow crypto – and other fintech firms – to be licensed through a national regime rather than have these companies secure money services business licenses on a state-by-state basis.      Prior to joining the OCC, Brooks was chief legal officer at crypto exchange Coinbase.
