42399043,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbi8Kg,1464122458,Coinbase Co-Founder: Ethereum Could ‘Blow Past’ Bitcoin,"In a sweeping, 2,500-word blog post today, Fred Ehrsam, the co-founder of one of the best funded blockchain startups, Coinbase, took aim at what he called a ""stagnant"" bitcoin community that he characterized as being outperformed by innovators working on the Ethereum network.  Coinciding with the rebranding of the Coinbase exchange and the launch of trading for Ethereum's blockchain token, ether, the public comments are the latest sign that Coinbase leadership remains dissatisfied with what they perceive as a lack of progress among bitcoin’s developers and with the technology as a whole.  In the post, Ehrsam sought to position Ethereum as a possible competitor to bitcoin, indicating his belief that the competing protocol could ""blow past bitcoin entirely"".  Ehrsam wrote:  ""There is nothing that bitcoin can do which Ethereum can’t. While Ethereum is less battle tested, it is moving faster, has better leadership and has more developer mindshare. First mover advantage is challenging to overcome, but at current pace, it’s conceivable.""  The statements follow months of tensions between the once fast-growing startup and the bitcoin community, which found CEO Brian Armstrong often calling vocally for bitcoin developers to increase a limit on the amount of data that could be included in blocks on the bitcoin blockchain.  Armstrong sought to position this inaction as a limiter of growth on the network as a whole, a position that showcased the divisions between bitcoin developers and its business community that saw this as a roadblock to new customer onboarding.  Still, Ehrsam sought to position Ethereum as moving the development of ""digital currency"" and its technology forward, emphasizing that Coinbase intends to support both protocols, and that it sees them growing together to become “low-level protocols” in what could be a new Internet for value exchange.  ""Competition and new ideas create better outcomes for everyone. Even if Ethereum goes up in flames our collective knowledge in digital currency will have leveled up significantly,"" Ehrsam said.  The comments drew some notable commentary that characterized Coinbase’s statements as perhaps being the result of issues it faces as a venture-backed startup, with a former business development executive at the company tweeting:  “Important to remember: bitcoin has infinite patience and no burn rate. Take individual perspectives with a big grain of salt.”  Lack of growth  Though Ehrsam lauded the success of the bitcoin network, his blog post was sharply critical of the developer community and business ecosystem that has thus far developed around it.  In particular, he questioned why only ""infrastructure apps"" have been built on the bitcoin blockchain, drawing attention to the idea that seven years into its development, the digital currency had produced no ""killer apps"".  Ehrsam sought to position this as the result of bitcoin’s limited scripting language, though he acknowledged that this was intended by its design.  ""My theory has been that the scripting language in bitcoin — the piece of every bitcoin transaction that lets you run a little software program along with it — is too restrictive,"" he wrote.  Likewise, he framed Ethereum as more friendly to those who want to develop blockchain-based applications, calling the level of app development in the community ""already faster than bitcoin’s"".  Coinbase developers, he said, have been able to use the platform to build simple apps in just a few days, a data point he contrasted to the difficulty of performing a similar feat on the bitcoin network.  ""I cannot overemphasize enough how important this combination of full programming functionality and ease of use is,"" he continued.  Superior development  Ehrsam further framed Ethereum as empowering a new generation of developers, in part, due to what he termed a ""healthy"" core development team that he sees as encouraging collaboration.  In particular, praise was given to Ethereum inventor Vitalik Buterin, who Ehrsam lauded as seeming comfortable as a community and technical leader.  Ehrsam went on to contrast this with the bitcoin developer community who he sought to characterize as both divisive and a contributor to the loss of interest in the platform.  “Beyond a leadership vacuum, bitcoin’s ‘leadership’ is less clear and toxic,” he said. “The content on the bitcoin discussion boards feels like squabbling while Ethereum’s is talking about relevant issues and new ideas.”  Ultimately, Ehrsam’s most pronounced criticism was that the Ethereum perhaps has momentum on its side, as he said the network is making ""faster and more consistent"" technical progress than bitcoin.  In the end, however, Ehrsam sought to portray the technologies as moving toward the same set of goals, at once welcoming Ethereum into his definition of “digital currency” while stating he has “no allegiance” to any particular network.  Ehrsam said:  ""Taking a step back, it feels like the rate of change in digital currency is accelerating.""

42399044,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbi8Me,1464119789,Chinese Finance Giant Joins R3 Blockchain Consortium,"Amid growing interest in blockchain technology among the world's biggest banks, a major Chinese financial firm has inked a new partnership with startup R3CEV.  Ping An Insurance Group, with total assets in excess of $765bn, is China's first financial firm to join the group. Ping An has a number of business arms, working in the insurance, banking and personal finance sectors.  David Rutter, CEO and founder of R3, said in a statement:  ""The addition of Ping An is another important milestone for R3 as we develop our member network to represent the interests of banks and financial institutions operating in markets around the globe.""  Headquartered in New York, R3’s consortium of global financial institutions now includes members from Asia, Europe and North America, but the entrance of Ping An is notable given that the firm operates within China, the world’s second largest economy.  Jessica Tan, chief operating officer for Ping An Group, suggested that the Shenzhen-based company is most interested in using the technology to facilitate transfers of digital assets.  “Ping An Group has always been at the forefront of using technology and innovation in its banking, insurance, investment and internet businesses,"" said Tan. ""We are excited about joining R3 and look forward to developing and using blockchain technology to create a more efficient way of managing financial assets digitally end-to-end.”  The addition of Ping An to the consortium's ranks comes on the heels of the formal unveiling of one of R3's flagship development projects.  In April, the startup unveiled a blockchain-inspired technology applications, called Corda, that re-imagined distributed ledgers from the ground with an eye to exchanging contracts as opposed to assets.

42399051,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbi8RZ,1464115018,"The Bitcoin Foundation Wants a Comeback, But Can it Be Saved?","Once one of the most well-known public advocates for bitcoin, the Bitcoin Foundation has faced a long series of obstacles in its bid to remain relevant to the technology's community.  Thus far this year, the industry's oldest trade organization has moved to strike a conciliatory tone with bitcoin's volunteer development team, capitalize on a potentially life-saving infusion of cash and move forward on a plan of action with new board members.  But, that doesn’t mean every member of the bitcoin community is on board.  An email sent from the Bitcoin Foundation executive director Bruce Fenton that pitched a group of Bitcoin Core members to take a seat on the board of directors and subsequently leaked on social media has been met with skepticism bordering on derision.  The Bitcoin Foundation has long attracted criticism from bitcoin community members over everything from issues with the handling of donations to law enforcement issues with those who once formerly represented it, two of which are now incarcerated.  Late last year, it was finally revealed that the group was running low on funds after maintaining a high burn rate.  In interview, Core contributor Peter Todd offered his take on why the reaction to the email has been so negative from some members of the bitcoin community.  Todd told CoinDesk:  ""I think they wanted to state what they’re aims were. Unfortunately, I don’t think they can represent Bitcoin Core anymore. It hasn’t been an organization that people have wanted to be associated with and I personally would like to distance myself from it.""  No stranger to controversy, Todd played an active role in jumpstarting the conversation by tweeting a link to the email (now since deleted), followed by another message advocating for the Bitcoin Foundation to start ""fresh under a different name"".  The email in question was addressed to members of the Bitcoin Core development team, its largely volunteer development organization, and included a proposal that a ""qualified member"" of the development community serve as a board member. Further, the email proposed that a committee chair or chief of development be appointed by Fenton.  Fenton wrote:  ""We hope for Core Devs to consider the foundation an asset that belongs to you just as much as us or anyone else. We've fixed much of what needed fixing and would welcome your help to make this the most effective benefit to bitcoin it can be.""  Recent interviews suggest that this approach fits into the broader objectives the organization is seeking.  New directions  During an interview with CoinDesk last week, Fenton talked about his hopes for the Foundation’s future direction following on recent funding successes.  Members of its board, including Fenton, BTCC CEO Bobby Lee, board chair and Blockchain Capital managing director Brock Pierce, each donated $10,000 to keep the foundation afloat this year. In addition, a surprise donation of bitcoin worth $65,000 was also made by a mysterious mining entity.  Fenton said that the collective funds will be used to fuel the organization's education and outreach efforts, as well as a renewed focus on developers by way of its DevCore event series.  Fenton said he’d like to help ""bridge the gap"" for companies facing talent shortages as it relates to bitcoin and blockchain-related skills. He said this process would begin with dialogue with corporations to see what specific skills are in demand, which would then shape a curriculum.  Yet, perhaps the single largest obstacle facing the Bitcoin Foundation has to do with how the board itself is formed, where each of its approximately 1,500 members get a vote.  Last year, former Bitcoin Foundation board members Jim Harper and Olivier Janssens resigned after they each cast a vote to disband the organization. The runners-up from the previous election were then appointed in their place.  Going forward, Fenton said he’d like to see the Foundation embrace a more ""conventional structure"".  Fenton said:  ""If you look at organizations around the world, there isn’t a correlation between detailed minutes and complicated election processes. In fact, it’s probably quite the opposite.""  As to what that structure might look like in practical terms, Fenton acknowledged more work discussion was needed.  ""We’re not really sure what we’re going to do with elections right now,"" he said.  From the outside looking in  At least one former stakeholder in the Foundation says the group would benefit from more active engagement.  After leaving the organization last year, former board member Jim Harper has returned full-time to his work at the Cato Institute. In conversation with CoinDesk, he said that the Foundation needs a stronger sense of direction, an actively engaged board and a stronger reputation.  But on whether the group could actually achieve this, Harper was less certain.  ""The Foundation has enough baggage that I think it's time for something else,"" he said.  Fenton defended the group's recent actions, saying that the Foundation has moved to address the issues that led to problems in the past.  He concluded:  ""If you step back and look at it fairly, this is a group of about a dozen people who put in their own money and do what they can.""

42399038,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbi8Dn,1464106709,Federal Court Dismisses Bitcoin Startup BitPay's Phishing Lawsuit,"A legal battle between bitcoin payment processor BitPay and a major insurance company has ended.  Filed yesterday, a court order dismissed the suit between BitPay and Massachusetts Bay Insurance Company, a subsidiary of Hanover Insurance, without prejudice. According to the court order signed by US District Judge Steve Jones, the two sides ""have reached a settlement in principal"".  The suit traces back to late 2014, when BitPay lost approximately $1.8m in bitcoin during a phishing attack that targeted the company’s leadership team. At the time, the unknown attacker was able to trigger payments from BitPay by posing as BTC Media CEO David Bailey, whose computer had been taken over.  BitPay's management team went on to authorize three separate bitcoin transactions, including one from a company account on Bitstamp, a European bitcoin exchange.  Shortly after the incident, BitPay filed a claim on the losses with the insurer. After discussions over a payout deteriorated over disagreements about the terms of BitPay’s insurance policy, the Atlanta-based startup took Massachusetts Bay Insurance Co to court. At the time, BitPay was seeking a payout amount of $950,000, plus court fees and unspecified damages.  In subsequent court filings, Massachusetts Bay Insurance Co disputed the allegations, and in the months to come the two sides fought over the evidence-gathering process. These problems have ostensibly come to a conclusion with news of the settlement.  The exact terms of the settlement were not disclosed in the court order, and BitPay spokesperson James Walpole declined to comment when reached. A representative for Hanover did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

42426916,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxSdh,1464101048,UAE's First Bitcoin Startup Shuts Down,"Bitcoin payments firm YellowPay, by some accounts the first industry startup in the Middle East, has shut down for undisclosed reasons according to members of its founding team.  Forming in 2014, YellowPay had sought to promote bitcoin as an e-commerce solution in the Middle East, enlisting a former managing director for PayPal as a senior advisor.  Despite this traction, other sources suggested the startup faced issues with its business model, including a decision to continue to emphasize the benefits of digital currency for online payments, a business strategy that has fallen out of favor with the industry and investors.  Still, the revelation comes amid a positive news cycle for the technology in the region, with the Dubai government officially partnering to host Keynote 2016, a blockchain-focused conference to be held 30th May.  Further, the news comes as another Yellow founder and former advisor Ola Doudin raised an undisclosed seed round for a regional startup called BitOasis. Investors in the deal include MENA-focused VC firm Wamda Capital and regional payment processor PayFort.

42426902,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxSFh,1464091232,Payment Processor Invests in Dubai-Based Bitcoin Startup,"Online payment service provider PayFort is among a number of participants to invest in a seed funding round for Dubai-based bitcoin startup BitOasis.  Additional participants included MENA-focused venture capital firm Wamda Capital, early Internet entrepreneur Samih Toukan, serial industry investor Digital Currency Group and a group of unnamed angel investors. The total amount raised was not disclosed.  With the announcement, BitOasis becomes the first bitcoin startup in the region to announce venture funding, which positions the firm at the forefront of a very nascent sector of the global bitcoin and blockchain industry.  CEO Ola Doudin said that the funding would be used to expand BitOasis and its bitcoin payments and exchange services to new markets throughout the Middle East and North Africa.  Doudin said in statements:  ""We see great potential in enabling future payment applications, specifically peer-to-peer payments and remittances, that we’re developing our API integrations and developer platform to support.""  Doudin said the startup would also seek to strengthen its presence in Dubai, an area that has emerged as the regional leader in bitcoin and blockchain technology.  The funding comes on the heels of the March launch of the Global Blockchain Council (GBC), a 32-member consortium of regional startups, local government entities and the area divisions of international IT giants including Cisco, Microsoft and SAP.  Doudin is also scheduled to appear with partners from this group at Keynote 2016 next week. To be held on 30th May, the Dubai-based conference will see a notable selection of Global Blockchain Council members discuss topics related to the blockchain ecosystem and its potential in the region.

42426920,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxSjh,1464063893,Report: US Postal Service Could Create its Own Digital Currency,"The US Postal Service (USPS) has released a new report outlining how it could adopt blockchain technology within its operations.  The report, issued by the Postal Service's Office of the Inspector General (OIG), suggests that the service should consider using the technology to reinforce its supply chains, create connected device networks or even issue its own digital currency.  Published today  , the OIG report posits that in the short-term, the government should devote resources to weighing where applications could be made, arguing that ""beginning to experiment with its possible applications could benefit postal operations and customers"".  The report's authors state:  ""The Postal Service could benefit from blockchain technology in the short term by studying the technology and possibly experimenting with blockchain-based solutions for financial services. The Postal Service already offers some financial services, including money orders and international money transfers, where blockchain could be an enabling tool, allowing the Postal Service to offer these services more efficiently.""  It’s an idea that has drawn attention from similar services in the past. In March, Australian delivery service Australia Post said it was investigating using the technology for digital identity applications.  In a statement, Postal Service chief information security officer and VP of digital solutions Randy Miskanic further suggested that the government hasn’t done much beyond evaluation.  ""As highlighted in the report, we will need to be cautious in specific implementations to account for technology barriers, security concerns and regulatory uncertainty,"" he said. ""We will evaluate the use of blockchain for each of the use cases and further review the available opportunities while considering the impact of the technology and financial restrictions.""  A ‘Postcoin’ for global payments  One notable recommendation is the creation of a cryptocurrency for the Postal Service itself.  The cryptocurrency, dubbed ‘Postcoin’, was initially proposed in a 2015 paper by Switzerland-based consultancy Swiss Economics. Swiss Economics was later hired by the OIG as part of its research.  According to the OIG report, Postcoin could help the service alleviate global money transfer problems. Further, the report’s authors speculate that an in-house cryptocurrency would make it easier for globally connected postal offices to transact with one another directly.  The report outlines:  ""...the Postal Service currently offers international money transfers. However, these services are currently only cashable in a limited number of countries. The flexibility and convenience associated with the Postcoin could potentially allow the expansion of electronic money transfer services to anyone in the world.""  Notably, the report suggests that the Postal Service could use a public blockchain like bitcoin’s for this application.  Possible avenues of deployment explored include buying tokens for an existing blockchain or using a form of watermarking to denote which ones are Postcoins. Alternatively, the Postal Service could bootstrap an entirely new blockchain instead, the report suggests.  “One option is to “buy in” to an existing, public blockchain. A postal operator would first have to acquire some coins. Once the post owns the coins, it could add an additional layer of information to each coin, or fraction of a coin, to mark it as representing a specific and distinct asset — in this case, a Postcoin,” the report explains.  The main justification: the Postal Service would effectively inherit a system of miners who collectively process and validate transactions on the blockchain.  ""The advantage of buying into an existing and already widely used platform is that the post does not have to foot the bill for the costs to maintain the validation system or to secure the payment network,"" the report states.  Connecting trucks to cut costs  Another possible application suggested by the OIG could see the Postal Service connecting its network of delivery trucks by way of a blockchain.  ""Imagine if postal vehicles and sorting equipment could manage their own tracking, monitoring and maintance[sic],"" the report’s authors write. ""For example, a vehicle could monitor the performance of its brake pads, determine when one is about to wear out, find out if that part is still under warranty, create a contract with the manufacturer to install a replacement part, and then pay for the brake pad and service – all autonomously.""  The OIG speculated that it could cut maintenance spending by as much as 7% through the creation of a mechanism by which connected vehicles could self-report any mechanical problems.  A federal audit released earlier this year reported that the Postal Service is wasting millions of dollars annually because of inefficiencies in its vehicle maintenance operations.  Mail service blockchains  According to the report, the Postal Service could start looking into using the technology for supply chain monitoring. This would be accomplished, the OIG suggests, through the use of sensors and blockchain smart contracts to trigger cash releases along the supply chain’s lifecycle.  “Using blockchain to manage interactions between these different entities could speed up shipments, particularly international ones,” the report’s authors state, going on to write:  ""Each mailpiece, whether a parcel or letter, could be uniquely identified on a blockchain and have the ability to create transactions, allowing for the timely sharing of information and processing of payments.""  While the report acknowledges that ""it would currently be prohibitively expensive to tag every piece of mail with a sensor"", the OIG indicates that the Postal Service could use its market heft to encourage adoption in the long-term.  ""This application would allow the Postal Service to keep an auditable chain of custody and embed additional shipment and tracking information to facilitate customs clearance and faster delivery,"" the report concludes.
