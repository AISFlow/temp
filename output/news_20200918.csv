The product, called Harvest and built on the Kava blockchain, allows users to stake their crypto so it can be lent out to other users. Harvest will initially support deposits of BTC, BNB, BUSD and XRP. Soon, Kava Labs plans to debut automated market makers (AMMs) like Uniswap and robo-advisers like Yearn.Finance on the blockchain as well, said Kava Labs CEO Brian Kerr.      Similar to DeFi platform MakerDAO, Kava will allow users to create collateralized debt positions (CDPs) on the Kava protocol in exchange for a stablecoin, USDX, pegged one-to-one with the U.S. dollar. Unlike Maker, though, Kava works with assets outside the Ethereum ecosystem that have largely watched the DeFi craze from afar.      Kava Labs is backed by several large exchanges, including Binance, Huobi and OKEx, which stake kava tokens and participate in the blockchain’s governance.    Yield farming, meet Harvest    Kerr said Harvest was inspired by Aave and Compound, but Harvest will bring the same capabilities these protocols have to a larger array of digital assets.      “When we were building out Harvest, we saw the design paradigm already working,” Kerr said. “What we can bring to the table is unlocking these much larger market-cap assets and giving them the same type of lending and borrowing functionality.”      Read more: Multi-Chain DeFi Protocol Raises $750K in Token Sale With Framework Ventures      Harvest users who borrow or lend on the app will be paid their interest and HARD tokens, the governance token of Harvest, which will also be used to incentivize liquidity on the platform.

42432714,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO0w7h,1600460922,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Tests $11K; Uniswap Passes $1.5B Locked,"Bitcoin has lost its market momentum. Meanwhile, the amount of cryptocurrency locked in decentralized exchange Uniswap was nearly doubled on Friday.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $10,867 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 0.42% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $10,812-$11,039  BTC below its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bearish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin was only able to eclipse the $11,000 level briefly Friday before dropping to as low as $10,812 on spot exchanges such as Coinbase.      “Markets are looking weak on drying-up liquidity on exchanges while BTC hardly managed to reach back above the $11,000 level and couldn't sustain it,” said Jean Baptiste Pavageau, partner at trading firm ExoAlpha.      Indeed, major USD/BTC exchange volumes are looking feeble, with Friday tallying a $211 million total so far while daily averages the past month have been $364 million.      Rupert Douglas, head of institutional sales at crypto brokerage Koine, is concerned stock markets are in for a correction, potentially hurting crypto as investors look to unload risky assets.      “I think equities are headed lower and if that happens digital assets will get sucked down, too,” Douglas told CoinDesk. “The tech shares are too frothy,” he added      Stock markets globally were mixed to cap off the week:    In Asia the Nikkei 225 ended the day flat, in the green 0.18% as concerns about company earnings in the face of the coronavirus pandemic prompted investor caution.  In Europe the FTSE 100 closed in the red 0.47% as the U.K. government considers another lockdown due to the coronavirus.  In the United States the S&P 500 fell 1.7% as losses in the tech sector dragged down the index, including Apple slipping 3%.    Another factor crypto investors are tracking: Bitcoin dominance, a measure of its market capitalization as a percentage of total cryptocurrencies. September has seen bitcoin hit 2020 dominance lows, hovering around 60% Friday.      “So far, bitcoin dominance has largely been sliding downwards since the beginning of 2020,” said Andrew Tu, an executive at crypto quant trading firm Efficient Frontier. “It will be interesting to see if we see a short-term reversion of the bitcoin dominance back upwards.”      ExoAlpha’s Pavageau says decentralized finance, or DeFi, is captivating the crypto market, and that is causing weakness for bitcoin.      Read More: This DeFi Group Wants to Bring Maturity to the Yield Farming Craze      “The market is focused on DeFi. It seems that locking value is also draining liquidity from exchanges as traders are noticing higher slippage when executing in the market,” Pavageau said. “A question to ask might be: Is the total value locked a threat to market liquidity for active traders?”    Uniswap crosses $1.5 billion locked    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down Friday, trading around $379 and slipping 2.3% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      The amount of cryptocurrency “locked” in decentralized exchange Uniswap has crossed $1.5 billion for the first time since Sept. 7. Investors have been quickly plowing crypto into Uniswap’s smart contracts over the past 24 hours, an 80% increase in value locked for that time period.      The dynamics of Uniswap have changed due to the decentralized exchange’s decision to release its own token, known as UNI, said Brian Mosoff, chief executive officer for investment firm Ether Capital.      Read More:Uniswap’s Newly Launched UNI Token Has Already Doubled in Price      “Users are likely locking ETH into Uniswap because they want to farm the $UNI token,” Mosoff said. “Many crypto users see Uniswap as the category leader, and rightfully so given the team and its backers. Users want to participate financially in the growth of the platform.""    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mixed Friday, mostly in the red.

42432709,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO0vzh,1600447778,"How Web 3.0 Creates Value for Users, Not Platforms","When Satoshi Nakamoto invented Bitcoin in 2009, we began to envision decentralized finance as an alternative to traditional banking. A little more than a decade later, we are starting to see that technologies behind Bitcoin can be used to create a fully reimagined internet – one that leverages our collective computing capacity, data and devices to become far more powerful and resilient than it is today.      To say the internet has created astounding pathways for opportunity and success is an understatement. It has democratized access to information, created boundless economic opportunities and connected people worlds apart. In 1990, fewer than 1% of the world’s population was online. Thirty years later, that number has jumped to 59% of the world’s ever-growing population. Even narrowly defined, the internet today contributed 10% of the U.S. economy. It is undoubtedly one of the most important technologies ever invented.    This article is a part of the Internet 2030 series, a look at the future of the internet and our digital lives. Pooja Shah is the product lead for the Filecoin Project.    This growth has come at a price. Today’s internet looks less like its inventors’ visions of a decentralized, democratic information network and more like an oligopoly controlled largely by the companies that own the data. Big Tech platforms know for whom and what we search, who are our friends and family, what we like and dislike. These companies capitalize on our digital identities for their lucrative advertising-based business models, capturing enormous value at the expense of the privacy of their users.      Most users accept the privacy and opportunity costs because of the convenience and value these services provide. But we have to ask ourselves: Do we want our personal data to continue as the engine of the internet economy? Is there a better path forward for the internet of 2030?      See also: Internet 2030: The Future and How We Get There      In a few years, all companies will need to rethink their operating models to treat their users as crucial partners from the start. Proprietary platforms might start to become open-source protocols. Companies’ sustained competitive advantages will come from product and technological superiority but also from user loyalty and trust. To succeed, companies will need to move toward more open services with plentiful value capture opportunities for usersalong the way.      In the last few years, internet visionaries such as Tim Berners-Lee and scores of newcomers have been exploring the merits of a new internet built on some of these ideas as well as the principles of privacy and decentralization. This technological movement is now called “Web 3.0.”      Web 3.0 networks are powered by decentralized protocols. These protocols rely on and engineer the cooperation of their users to drive specific outcomes, whether that means running millions of programs (smart contracts) through the Ethereum decentralized computing platform or powering a truly decentralized data storage marketplace such as Filecoin (where I work).    The internet is one of humanity’s most important technologies. Let’s make sure it serves us well for decades to come.    Instead of relying on trusted intermediaries to coordinate users, Web 3.0 systems use mechanisms such as cryptographic proofs and economic incentives to guarantee users that the system is working as expected. As a result, Web 3.0 networks are trustworthy, yet decentralized. And because these projects succeed only if their users cooperate, their creators have strong incentives to align with their users’ best interests.      Instead of extracting value from their users, Web 3.0 networks will capture value by creating opportunities forthem. In this way, Web 3.0 protocols essentially turn the economic incentive structure of today’s internet on its head.      In the last few years, we have seen a Cambrian explosion of Web 3.0 applications, from decentralized lending and mobile payment solutions to video encoding services to decentralized advertising exchanges. These projects all rely on many individuals devoting resources collectively to create diverse open services and products. And because they require collective user cooperation to succeed, these projects make it a core tenet to protect, not exploit, their users and their privacy.      See also: Preston J. Byrne – Twitter Doesn’t Need Web 3.0 to Solve Its Identity Problem      If successful, these types of projects could pave the way for new internet business models that protect individual users and allow the creators to capture value from their inventions. These Web 3.0 systems – the new internet – could upend advertising-based business models, so far one of the most successful business models of all time.      There is a lot to do before we can truly say we have built a more performant, secure and resilient internet infrastructure for all of humanity. But we’re getting closer every day. Decentralizing the internet will shift its power structure and redistribute ownership of this critical technology to individuals like you and me.

42432710,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO0w3h,1600447121,Money Reimagined: Climate-Friendlier Crypto,"Haunting red skies, a mounting death toll and a giant swath of smoldering devastation across 12 western U.S. states compels us to talk this week about climate change and what it means for the cryptocurrency industry.      Because, whether you like it or not, both of those things are not going away.      Sadly, the overlap between people working in crypto and people working to contain climate change is small. But the reality is that the future of cryptocurrencies and the future of our planet’s climate are closely intertwined.      Climate change is a global problem that transcends borders, yet as Californians and Oregonians learned from this month’s wildfires it delivers highly localized effects. It is, in other words, a decentralized phenomenon, one the existing centralized hierarchies of nation-states have spectacularly failed to contain.      Given the long delays in national governments even agreeing on, let alone enforcing, climate treaties, an overheating planet urgently needs a decentralized governance strategy for managing climate change, one that allows local actors to self-enroll in a platform that aligns the impact of their actions with others elsewhere in the world. It’s something that a handful of researchers in the blockchain community are trying to tackle.      There’s a lot of interest, for example, in using international blockchain frameworks to capture and immutably record environmental data generated by sensors in a decentralized network of devices. That way, local governments or impact investment funds, say, have a pool of reliable, real-time measurements with which to assess their actions.      Yale University’s Open Climate project is exploring the foundation of a global climate ledger using blockchain technology. Separately, in a column for CoinDesk this week, Mattereum founder Vinay Gupta talked of using blockchain’s tracking capacity to bring transparency to the environmental impact of production along the world’s supply chains.    Money monsters    But while there are many such projects seeking to leverage blockchain solutions to improve climate data and finance green development, the mainstream view of crypto’s impact on the environment is dominated by a more narrow, emotionally fraught debate: whether electricity-hungry bitcoin miners are setting us on path to environmental ruin.      Bitcoin’s critics in this fight are led by researcher Alex de Vries, whose Digiconomist website provides metrics comparing the bitcoin mining network’s carbon emissions levels to those of countries – right now, he says it’s on par with that of Azerbaijan. De Vries and others argue that even if most bitcoin miners use renewable energy – last year, CoinShares put the proportion at 73% of total hashing power – they displace non-crypto residential and business users from those sources, leading them to tap dirty energy sources they would otherwise have not used.      I’ve argued in past columns that this perspective is valuable but overly alarmist, because it views bitcoin’s carbon emissions outlook in static terms when it is actually highly dynamic.    This is the kind of framing that’s needed for the crypto community to rise above the scary headlines of environmental disaster    Both renewable energy technology and bitcoin mining chips are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly efficient. In the near-perfect market in which miners compete for bitcoin rewards, they will be increasingly driven to tap increasingly cheap renewable solutions. That will not only make the Bitcoin network more efficient but, as it grows, will create a positive feedback loop in which renewable energy providers are further incentivized to produce better products.      The core question, though, is how quickly we can get there. It’s a question made all the more urgent by the wake-up call from California’s wildfires.      In the future, energy efficiency tends toward zero net emissions. But, as John Maynard Keynes said, in the long run we’re all dead. We need to worry about what’s happening now, in a phase when government subsidies and corruption in many parts of the world still create profitable opportunities for both bitcoiners and no-coiners to harness otherwise inefficient, carbon-heavy energy sources.      In that context, the fact that the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index currently puts total annualized network usage at a whopping 67.4 terawatt hours is cause for great concern. A not insignificant proportion of that energy still comes from coal.    Managing the grid    However, as I stated at the outset, neither crypto nor climate change risks are going to disappear. In fact, both are growing in size. So, how do we make the former more compatible with containing the latter?      One could argue Bitcoin should follow Ethereum’s lead and migrate from its energy-intensive proof-of-work consensus algorithm to a proof-of-stake system. But organizing a hard fork of that nature is not only nearly impossible to coordinate across the fractious Bitcoin community, it could directly challenge its value as an unchangeable “digital gold” bet on permanence and predictability.      Instead, the change must come at the business level and, rather than merely having miners use more efficient, renewable resources for their own account, should be framed as a system-wide solution. It will involve tailored, grid-wide arrangements in which crypto companies are incentivized to use renewable energy and to help communities sustainably address their energy needs.      Enter Layer1. Setting aside some of the legal disputes that have lately gripped this Peter Thiel-backed mining company, its innovative business model points to a future where Bitcoin can be compatible with environmental management.      Layer1 has entered into an agreement where the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas pays the company to shut down its miners in the western Texas region during hours of peak demand. This helps the grid operator manage the difficult peaks and troughs of overall community usage and generation, a problem that becomes even more extreme as residential solar systems continue to be added to the overall supply of electricity.      In energy markets like California’s, solar production creates something known as the “duck curve.” Essentially, that means solar panels generate a surplus of electricity in the sunniest hours of the day, which is mismatched with the peak demand that hits later in the day when people return home from work and crank up their ACs. Without effective storage mechanisms, that intraday energy is wasted, imposing a large unrealized opportunity cost on the system. What’s needed is a big buyer with intraday energy needs. As Messari’s Mason Nystrom explains in this Twitter thread, bitcoin miners are well placed to fill that role.      As Layer1 CEO Alexander Liegl explained to CoinDesk’s Brady Dale last year, putting bitcoin miners into this duck curve management role challenges the critics’ thesis that their hunger for electricity crowds out other uses for clean energy. “Renewable energy is still primarily under-utilized, so you don’t actually have a zero-sum game,” he said.      More than that, though, these arrangements put Bitcoin into a strategic place in the ecosystem where it actively empowers communities to pursue sustainable energy solutions. They make it easier for them to onboard home solar, for example, without overburdening the grid, which encourages the resilience of energy decentralization and contributions to decarbonization.      There’s an even wider symbiosis here, too.      Bitcoin miners are focused on turning energy into money. But in doing so they provide a vital service to owners and users of bitcoin, securing its decentralized system of value exchange from attackers so that a digital form of provably scarce money can be stored and used in a self sovereign manner. By sharing the risks and benefits of managing the energy supply between communities and miners, a common interest is forged in both environmental sustainability and the perpetuation of a peer-to-peer financial and payments system.      This is the kind of framing that’s needed for the crypto community to rise above the scary headlines of environmental disaster and position itself as an agent of positive change in the world.    The ‘musical chairs index’    DeFi Pulse’s statistics on “total value locked” for applications within decentralized finance have become de facto benchmarks for measuring the rapid growth of the nascent DeFi ecosystem. So perhaps it was inevitable that the data provider would be the first to create an index for the fast-growing sector. After launching the DeFi Pulse Index this month to track the performance of ten of the most popular DeFi tokens on Ethereum, we can see from a Thursday midday screengrab of DeFi Pulse’s partner Set Protocol’s website that the first nine days have been pretty rocky. After opening at a value of $99.73 on Sept. 8, the index peaked at $136.03 on Sept. 12, marking a gain of 36.4% in just four days. But since then it has fallen all the way back to $107.79.      The net gain of just over 8% for the nine days would be a good return for a normal traditional finance investor. But against the massive moves in DeFi token prices in recent months it seems positively anemic. The result also seems to contradict DeFi Pulse’s own metrics, which show a very strong 29% gain in the DeFi sector’s overall TVL for the same period, from $6.82 billion to $8.78 billion. Amid the breathless buzz around high-flying new entrants like SushiSwap, an automated money maker (AMM), and decentralized lending and borrowing protocol Aave, it feels as if this index isn’t capturing the reality of the industry.      We shouldn’t be surprised. While we should applaud DeFi Pulse for having a go at this, it was always going to be challenging to build an index at this very early stage, with so much change underway. The team chose 10 names to compile the index. But within days it felt old. There’s no Aave and there’s no SushiSwap, a fork of the index member Uniswap that was specifically designed to suck liquidity from its AMA. Sushi’s launch led to a sharp drop in Uniswap’s price. However, it was more than offset by a very sharp opening rally in Sushiswap – followed by a sudden drop after its anonymous founder dumped his tokens and then a big rebound when the founder returned the funds to the protocol. Overall, the impact of these new launches has been to greatly increase the value of the entire DeFi sector.      In short, the entire sector is functioning like a giant game of musical chairs, with newcomers suddenly emerging and rapidly surging into prominence within the industry, supplanting the positions of others. Overall, despite the gut-wrenching volatility, the impact of these new launches has been to greatly increase the value of the entire DeFi sector overall. But it’s not captured in an index, which by definition has a static makeup. Great to see these initiatives take shape, but it’s fair to say that this one might be a tad early.    The global town hall    CHINESE CONSUMER COMEBACK. For a brief period, COVID-19 looked like it would stall the geopolitical competition that had been brewing between the U.S. and China, as more immediate priorities took over. But it may also have exacerbated the tension as President Donald Trump sought to pin blame for the global pandemic on China, using derogatory, arguably racist terms to describe it. And, if anything, U.S. mistrust of Chinese technologies grew even further in this time, with Washington forcing social media site TikTok to sell its U.S. operations to a U.S. buyer. Nonetheless, the real significance of COVID-19 will be measured by how quickly and how strongly each side in this battle recovers from the economic fallout. And that goes directly to the heart of the battle for the future of money, of which we’ve written extensively, with China now in the process of launching its Digital Currency Electronic Payments (DCEP) system.      In this context, the latest numbers out of China might suggest that Beijing, with a markedly lower death count and mostly reopened economy, has the upper hand. In addition to a rebound in industrial activity in China, consumer spending is also now showing signs of a strong recovery there. This is important because China’s future lies in extracting itself from depending on exports and more on domestic spending. It also relates to the focus of China’s digital currency and blockchain strategy. The DCEP will, for now at least, be targeted at domestic users, including retail. Meanwhile, the investments China is making in other aspects of blockchain infrastructure will work to make the local economy more efficient. It’s here, not only in China’s much-publicized investments and interests in foreign markets, where its challenge to U.S. global supremacy will come. A more efficient, advanced, digitally driven domestic economy will be a stronger foundation from which to project overseas power than one in which it is dependent on selling Chinese-made clothes and electronic goods to the U.S.      ECBDC. With all the attention given to China’s launch of its central bank digital currency (CBDC), it’s easy to forget that policymakers in the European Union have been exploiting central bank digital currencies for some time and that experiments are underway. So it was a welcome addition to the research on CBDCs to find this new report focusing on the geopolitical implications of a European version of the technology. It comes from the folks at dGen, a think tank that works on issues for the “decentralized generation.”      The report warns that if the eurozone doesn’t introduce a CBDC by 2025, its ranking as the second-most important world reserve currency will be overtaken by China. On the other hand, it sees a unique opportunity for Europe to assert more international leadership if it produces a well-designed CBDC. The key words there are “well-designed.” The authors warn that European leaders need to be alert to pressures within the eurozone to offer a weakened version of the euro to boost export competitiveness and alleviate pressure in some of the weaker states of the region. Similarly, if different countries in the eurozone start introducing their own national digital currencies with the overarching structure of the euro, it could weaken the euro. They advise European authorities to work with, not against, private-sector developers of digital currencies, such as stablecoin issuers, in the rollout of a CBDC and related payments infrastructure.      NFTs MEET DEFI. While DeFi has generated the most excitement in the cryptocurrency space this year, quiet gains are also being registered in the market for non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. These unique pieces of digital property have sparked the imagination of many who see them as a way to transform rights management for digital media and art, reinvent gaming and create new mechanisms for brands to engage with their markets. The myriad ideas spawned by the NFT movement haven’t, however, so far shown a great deal of real-world traction.      Now, the NFT movement is hitching to the DeFi zeitgeist to crossbreed a new form of finance with a new form of digital property. This summer, as we reported last week, Robinhood-obsessed day traders from the non-crypto world have started to invest in NFTs that give them fractional ownership of expensive art pieces – even though many likely don’t know they’re buying a crypto product. And this week we reported that NFT gamemaker Dapper Labs, the creator of CryptoKitties, has now integrated Centre’s USDC stablecoin into its top-ranking NBA Top Shot game, a move that has generated $2 million in revenue and more than 58,000 transactions.      But it’s the DeFi-meets-NFTs combination that looks most enticing. Consider RARI, the new governance token introduced by the NFT marketplace Rariable. Much like governance tokens issued by AMAs and lending protocols in the DeFI universe, the RARI incentivizes people to participate in the market, in this case to buy and sell NFT-defined art. As reported by Mason Nystrom of Messari, Rarible volumes have surged since the RARI was introduced, topping $6 million in total. The marketplace’s monthly turnover number is on target to reach a figure ten times that of once-reigning NFT market, OpenSea. DeFi experiments such as yield farming and liquidity mining are showing that if you want people to use your protocols, give them an incentive.

When we first reported in July that China would incorporate six public blockchains into its national Blockchain Services Network, it was seen as a hint that the government, contrary to expectations, may see value in allowing a somewhat more open system. In the latest news from reporter David Pan, that appears to have changed: the list of integrated public blockchains has expanded to 24, but there’s a twist: the networks will have to be “localized,” which appears to be a euphemism for converting them into a private, permissioned network.      Uniswap Recaptures DeFi Buzz With UNI Token’s Airdropped Debut. One minute it was knocked off its perch by SushiSwap. Next minute it is back. With a dramatic airdrop of its new UNI governance token, with a listing on Coinbase, the Automated Market Maker (AMM) is happily grabbing headlines again, as Muyao Chen reports.

And like everything about the “singularity,” a concept that the founder of SingularityNET is heavily engaged in, blockchain’s contribution can go either way. It can help protect humanity, Goertzel says, or it can become a tool of “the hegemons.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET,Michael J.

42432704,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO0vrh,1600445655,"New on Bitcoin’s Lightning Network: LND Adds Accounting Feature, c-lightning Gets an Upgrade","While so-called “DeFi degens” are busy bidding up the price of food-themed tokens, on the other end of crypto’s DeFi spectrum two teams working on the most popular implementations of Bitcoin’s Lightning Network have been busy pushing out new features.      This week, both Lightning Labs, which maintains the Lightning Network Daemon (LND) implementation of the Lightning Network, and Blockstream, which maintains the c-lightning implementation, updated their tech stacks.      Read more: What Is Bitcoin’s Lightning Network?      For Lightning Labs, the update comes to its Faraday suite with the addition of an automated accounting feature to make bookkeeping easier for node operators and Lightning Network service providers (LSPs). For Blockstream, the 0.9.1 release of c-lightning improves channel opening and routing mechanisms to make opening channels (and sending payments) easier than before.    Lightning meets accounting    Lightning Labs updated its Faraday suite this week to bake in accounting tools for both Lightning and on-chain transactions.      As LND’s tech stack has increased to include advanced features like Lightning Loop, the accounting burden for businesses running Lightning services has likewise become more cumbersome.      Seemingly a simplistic update, the new Faraday accounting feature will automate what was formerly a manual process – a welcome tool for LSPs that have to wrestle with hundreds of Lightning channels swimming with several thousand dollars worth of liquidity.      Read more: Lightning Labs Releases ‘Loop’ Feature for Bitcoin Payments Channels      All the data collected by the automated accounting tool can be imported into Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel.      “By adding accounting reports to Faraday’s suite of tools, we hope to free up engineering time that has been spent auditing nodes, and allow businesses and builders to focus on delivering the uniquely Lightning features that we all love to end users. Accounting has been a common pain-point in integrating Lightning, one that we ourselves have felt when dealing with our own accounting internally,” Lightning Labs developer Carla Kirk-Cohen told CoinDesk.      According to Bitcoin service and payment provider OpenNode, the new accounting feature will help them save money by making channel-related data easier to parse in real time.      “Faraday allows us to easily calculate bitcoin-related operational expenditures and monitor channels' activity, allowing us to make data-driven decisions on where to deploy capital on the network in order to maximize its potential earnings” OpenNode CTO João Almeida told CoinDesk    Multi-channel, multi-part    Concurrent with Lightning Lab's Faraday release, Blockstream pushed improvements to its c-lightning implementation’s channel management and routing tools.      Version 0.9.1 of c-lightning ostensibly improves “multi-part payments,” (MPP) a method for splitting larger Lightning Network payments into fractions and routing these pieces through multiple payment channels. This method improves the likelihood that larger transactions will be able to find a route between sender and receiver, and the new version rids c-lightning of bugs to make the process more efficient.      Read more: ‘Multi-Part’ Payments Could Bring Bigger Bitcoin Sums to Lightning Network      Complementing this are improvements to c-lightning’s “route hint” feature, which gives a payer a warning if there isn’t enough liquidity along a given payment route to complete the transaction. The upgrade now provides multiple route hints to the benefit of multi-part payments.      But perhaps the most exciting update comes in the form of c-lightning’s multifundchannel plugin. With this feature, it’s now possible to open multiple channels with a single commitment transaction with c-lightning.      When trialing the feature on testnet, Blockstream’s team was able to open up 106 channels with a single transaction, though theoretically, even more channels could be opened simultaneously with the feature.      “With MPP, we go from a single channel being the bottleneck to being able to aggregate the capacity of multiple channels, and thus enable a much wider range of payments,” Blockstream c-lightning developer Christian Decker told CoinDesk.      “This increases the efficiency of both the Bitcoin network and node operation, ultimately making it easier and less expensive for nodes to open multiple smaller channels and it encourages them to contribute to the structural resilience of the Lightning network by reducing single points of failure.”    Different implementations, complementary parts    In our correspondence, Kirk-Cohen claimed that the new Faraday release, when taken in tandem with other recent LND updates, signals that the Lightning Network is ready for business and enterprise adoption.      ""The recent release of Wumbo in lnd v0.11.0 was a sign that we believe the software has matured to the point where businesses and serious node operators can start to move more capital onto the network. The release of accounting reports in Faraday is a continuation of that message, Lightning is ready for the big leagues.""      Read more: Ready to Wumbo: LND Enables More, Larger Bitcoin Transactions on Lightning      LND and c-lightning are two distinct implementations, but their respective features provide complementary building blocks to improve the Lightning Network’s overall tech stack. LND’s Wumbo features, for example, allows high-liquidity node operators to open larger channels and thus increase their ability to route incoming payments.      For its part, c-lightning’s multi-part payments and multifundchannelplugin complement Wumbo channels by making it easier for smaller-account holders to open multiple channels, Decker said.      “MPP and multifundchannel are complementary with Wumbo channels, which mostly enable the operation of larger nodes that have the necessary funds available to open large backbone channels. While a stable network backbone of large channels is good to get payments from one end of the network to another, they may also pose a risk, since they increase the reliance on individual channels. It is our belief that maintaining a balance between large node operators (to build a solid backbone) and smaller node operators is paramount for the survival of the network.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/09/18/new-on-bitcoins-lightning-network-lnd-adds-accounting-feature-c-lightning-gets-an-upgrade,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2ee8e6476035018addc213e9afe18884fd90113b-1225x980.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Top shelf    Token reflections Uniswap’s decision to airdrop its new governance token was less about competing with its genetic clone SushiSwap, and more about building a community, CoinDesk’s Brady Dale reports. “I think it’s genius in every way,” Robert Leshner, Compound’s founder, said. “It brought a huge number of users into the fold.” Tokens were airdropped not just to liquidity providers (LPs), but essentially anyone who has played with the app – meaning upwards of 250,000 unique Ethereum addresses that have made trades on it could come into possession. This could help Uniswap achieve the effective decentralization necessary to avoid the prying eyes of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. While the token is likely to spur a new round of liquidity mining, bumping up transactions fees on the platform, Dale also suggests UNI could be a means for the protocol – which raised an $11 million Series A – to repay its investors.      Ethereum records Ethereum miners earned a record $16.5 million on Thursday as the number of transactions on the network ticks up. More than 42,763 ether (ETH) were paid out in transaction fees for 1.4 million transactions – another all-time high. CoinDesk’s Paddy Baker points to a meteoric rise in decentralized finance (DeFi) to make sense of the surging Ethereum activity. There is currently over $9 billion worth of assets locked in DeFi applications, according to DeFi Pulse, up from approximately $675 million at the start of the year. Decentralized exchanges too are growing – led by Uniswap, Curve and Balancer – having recently surpassed $16 billion in total monthly volume.      Community points The number of monthly users who earned T-Points, or loyalty points, for bitcoin (BTC) payments on the bitFlyer exchange in Japan reached a record high in August. Though the exchange did not specify the number of users of the service, CoinDesk Japan previously reported approximately 30% of new visitors to the exchange are in their 20s. BTC was trading at 1.3 million Japanese yen ($12,400) in August for the first time in a year. Midori Kanemitsu, a market analyst at bitFlyer, indicated that this reflects a larger trend: against the backdrop of COVID-19 and global monetary easing, bitcoin is shifting from a speculative investment for individuals to an institutional hedge against inflation.      Track and trace The VeChain Foundation has become the first blockchain-based entity to join the China Animal Health and Food Safety Alliance (CAFA). According to a blog post, VeChain joins the 130 strong member group as its only public blockchain technology provider, and will further provide technical and infrastructural support for member firms. According to the post, CAFA intends to build a ""farm to table"" traceability system across China that would record the various stages of the food supply process on the blockchain in order to build trust with consumers.      Wallet challenge U.S. Homeland Security’s Science and Technology Directorate (S&T), wants you to build its next digital wallet. CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson reports the directorate is putting $25,000 up for grabs in their new digital wallet challenge, a user interface design competition to pair with DHS’s work in the blockchain and decentralized identity space. Finalist wallets must demonstrate “ease of use and visual consistency, while supporting interoperability, security, and privacy,” said Anil John, technical director of S&T’s Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP). Applications are open through Oct. 15, with the chance for three finalists to win $5,000 and an additional $10,000 to the competition winner.

A New York Supreme Court justice reiterated his call for Bitfinex and Tether to turn over documents detailing their financial relationship and history, in a Thursday hearing.      Judge Joel M. Cohen, the judge who has been overseeing the New York Attorney General’s (NYAG) office’s examination pertaining to the sister firms’ alleged $850 million cover-up, is applying pressure in what appears to be an attempt to speed up what has become a 17-month-long investigation.      Bitfinex’s legal fight with the NYAG began in April 2019, when the state prosecutor first alleged that Bitfinex had lost access to $850 million in funds held by Crypto Capital Corp., a payment processor whose operators were later indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice.      Stablecoin issuer Tether extended a line of credit and provided a loan to Bitfinex to cover the shortfall. The NYAG’s office requested access to the documents surrounding this deal.      Specifically, the NYAG wants to know where the funds went, whether any of the funds went to company executives and why transfers from Tether to Bitfinex were necessary.      Bitfinex and Tether are now appealing this request for documentation, with its representatives saying it is “literally impossible to comply with,” because the NYAG’s office has asked for “all documents” around USDT. A legal representative compared the request to “asking GM for all documents about cars,” earlier this week.      Defendant’s counsel also argues the investigation is past its prime. “We’ve now had 17 additional months of disclosure. All the dirty laundry about Crypto Capital has been aired … Whatever risk there may have been 17 months ago is gone,” Charles Michael, an attorney with Steptoe and Johnson, representing Bitfinex, said.      Cohen didn’t set a firm deadline for when Bitfinex and Tether would have to produce these documents, leaving that decision to a special referee, but said a deadline would need to be set. As part of his order, he extended an injunction that would have ended in the next few weeks barring Tether from loaning funds to Bitfinex by 90 days.    Market intel    Indecision reigns? Bitcoin clocked highs of $11,104 and $11,050 on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, but printed a UTC closing price below $11,000 on both occasions. Indecision is now the mood of the market. Increasing amounts of bitcoin are leaving wallets associated with miners for exchanges, an indication of selling pressure. According to data source Glassnode, 1,113.85 BTC were transferred to exchange wallets from miner wallets on Sept. 13 – the biggest single-day outflow since December. Should the latest indecisive price action end with an upward move, the focus would shift to the next hurdle at $11,200, CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reports.      $1B bitcoin Over $1 billion worth of bitcoin has been tokenized on Ethereum as of Thursday, CoinDesk news reporter Zack Voell found. In January, less than 1,200 BTC were tokenized worth less than $7 million. There are now more than 92,600 tokenized bitcoins (BTC), representing 0.42% of the total BTC supply. Wrapped bitcoin (WBTC), the largest tokenized bitcoin project, has minted over 60,500 tokenized BTC since its launch in early 2019, representing over 65% of the total tokenized BTC supply, while RenBTC, the second largest tokenized bitcoin project, has issued 22,000 tokenized bitcoins since May.    Op-ed    A little reality Preston Byrne, a CoinDesk columnist and Anderson Kill partner, wants American companies to stop issuing tokens and airdrops. Reflecting on Uniswap’s decision to distribute their new governance token widely, Byrne writes, “Cheerleaders will say that entrepreneurs are leaving money on the table by not doing a Uniswap-style airdrop to the American public. … But as a practical matter, many, if not most, of [token sales are securities]. No mental gymnastics, no think-pieces, no cryptographic magic dust, no novel naming conventions, and no “gotchas!” can work around the fact that courts work with economic reality, and economic reality on this most recent DEX token airdrop looks a lot like an investment contract.”    Podcast corner    Pal’s polemic Raoul Pal, CEO and co-founder of Real Vision, joins the latest episode of The Breakdown for a wide-ranging conversation into the mechanics behind the Federal Reserve, stablecoin disruption and why all macro debates are boring.

Data from CoinGecko shows the UNI token price has surged from just under $2.80 to a high of $5.80 in the past 24 hours.  The so-called governance token's market cap is now over $430 million, which makes it the 39th largest cryptocurrency in the space on CoinGecko's rankings.  The token started Thursday morning with a total value of approximately $50 million, meaning it's seen a near nine-fold increase in the past 36 hours or so.  UNI is trading around $5.48 at press time.  Uniswap only unveiled its new token, which will be used to power on-chain governance, late on Wednesday but it has quickly gained traction.  Coinbase – an exchange that's usually picky about the assets it lists – added UNI to its Pro trading platform just hours after the launch.  The project plans to issue all one billion UNI tokens to the community, founder and the team over the next four years.  Further, the project gave away a minimum of 400 UNI to anyone who had used Uniswap prior to September – an amount now worth over $2,000.  Should UNI continue at its present trajectory it could soon take over from decentralized lender Compound's COMP token – currently with a $540 million cap – which itself experienced a major price hike back in late June.

42432711,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO0w5h,1600436159,First Mover: Uniswap's Sudden $5B Token Valuation Cements Comeback From 'Vampire Mining' Attack,"Earlier this week, analysts with the cryptocurrency analysis firm Arcane Research were musing that new developments appeared to have slowed in the fast-growing blockchain arena of decentralized finance, known as DeFi. But they predicted any lull was likely to be temporary.      ""A new boost for DeFi tokens could be right around the corner,"" Arcane wrote Tuesday in a report. ""The sector seems determined to grow further.""      As if on cue, the decentralized exchange Uniswap late Wednesday made a surprise delivery of its new governance tokens to anyone who had ever used the project. Traders each got at least 400 of the UNI tokens, worth about $1,200 – prompting some witty commentators to call it “stimulus for Ethereum users,” since it was the same amount as the coronavirus aid checks mailed out earlier this year by the U.S. Treasury Department. By mid-day Thursday, more than 50,000 addresses were holding UNI tokens.      The project also allocated tokens to its team members, investors and advisers, for a total supply of 1 billion of the UNI coins. And just like that, the token issuance gave Uniswap an implied market token valuation of $3.7 billion on a fully diluted basis, making it instantly one of the largest projects in DeFi and even pushing Uniswap into the top 10 of the entire crypto industry.      By early Friday, the value had grown to $5.4 billion, according to Token Terminal, a digital-asset market data website.      CoinDesk's Muyao Shen described the early trading action as a ""roller-coaster ride,"" perhaps because nobody really had any idea what the tokens should be worth. But the token issuance represented a quick paper profit for big venture-capital investors like Andreesen Horowitz that had joined an $11 million funding round for the project just last month.      The capital event also cemented a comeback for Uniswap, which last week had many of its users lured away to a two-week-old copycat project called SushiSwap, via an apparently legal maneuver known as a vampire mining attack. SushiSwap managed to migrate more than $800 million in crypto assets from Uniswap.      The new token's debut touched off a flurry of announcements by major centralized exchanges like Binance and Coinbase Pro looking to cash in on the hot demand for DeFi-related anything; they listed the UNI tokens within just a few hours of the release. The OKEx exchange even offered a full set of trading tools for hedging UNI, including for spot trading, margin, swap trading and coin-margined perpetual swaps. Coinbase is among the project’s investors.      According to CoinDesk Senior Reporter Brady Dale, the UNI launch could touch off a ""fresh new boom"" in the phenomenon of liquidity mining, where users of projects are rewarded for their patronage with extra tokens, similar to credit-card rewards programs. Liquidity mining on Uniswap was set to start Sept. 18 at midnight, coordinated universal time.      “With their new token and broad distribution model, I believe it will significantly help them grow and retain their liquidity while building trust,” Paul Veradittakit, partner at Pantera Capital, told Dale.    Ethereum congestion    The Uniswap rollout may have contributed to congestion on the Ethereum blockchain, pushing up already-inflated transaction fee rates, CoinDesk's Daniel Cawrey reported.      The average transaction fee on the Ethereum network rose to about 0.03 ether, a 10-fold increase from June levels, with the fee rates themselves set based on market conditions, according to data aggregator Blockchair.      Jean-Marc Bonnefous, managing partner of Tellurian Capital, which invests in DeFi, told Cawrey that Uniswap’s surprise token launch could only make the situation worse.      “There has been a fair amount of congestion for some time already and we now have the very popular one-off airdrop of the much awaited Uniswap token UNI that is the talk of the town,” said Bonnefous. “DeFi definitely sets the agenda in the digital assets markets this month.”    Bitcoin Watch    Bitcoin is up 6% this week despite the recent spike in flow of coins from miner wallets to exchanges.      According to data source Glassnode, 1.1 million BTC were transferred to exchange wallets from miner wallets on Sept. 13. That was the biggest single-day outflow from miners to exchanges since December.      An increase in inflows into exchanges implies increased selling pressure. That's because miners and investors usually move coins to exchanges when they want to liquidate their holdings.      So far, however, bitcoin has remained resilient.      ""The rotation of money out of alternative cryptocurrencies and into bitcoin seems to be pushing bitcoin higher,"" senior cryptocurrency trader at Zurich-based Crypto Broker AG, told CoinDesk in a Twitter chat.      - Omkar Godbole  Read More: Bitcoin Rises Back to $11K Despite Signs of Indecision in the Market    Token Watch    SushiSwap (SUSHI): On-chain data analysis by IntoTheBlock appears to show yield farmers ""dumping their SUSHI on retail investors.""

42432698,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO0vdh,1600435302,"Cryptopia Users Can Claim Assets From End of 2020, Says Hacked Exchange's Liquidator","The liquidators of defunct cryptocurrency exchange Cryptopia have told users they'll soon be able to register to claim their trapped digital assets, worth a combined $100 million.    The New Zealand branch of accountancy firm Grant Thornton said the claims registration process, previously described as a ""mammoth task,"" will open ""by the end of the year,"" although a precise date hasn't been given.  The liquidators will reach out to the 960,000 account holders via official channels, and will verify identities and account information of claimants.  Grant Thornton has said the steps are necessary to ensure the repatriation of assets complies with New Zealand law and doesn't inadvertently fall into the hands of criminals or even the exchange's hackers.  An estimated $17.8 million worth of cryptocurrencies was stolen from Cryptopia in early 2019.  Although the exchange attempted to restart its trading services, the blow to its business forced it to enter liquidation in May of that year.  Cryptopia held an estimated $100 million worth of digital assets at the time of its liquidation.  These funds were held by liquidators and were embroiled in a legal case over whether they should be used to settle claims of the exchange's creditors.  But a court found in May that the cryptocurrency in question should be classed as a form of property that belonged to users and was only held in trust by Cryptopia.  As such, users are entitled to receive their cryptocurrencies back.

42432702,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO0vlh,1600434049,This DeFi Group Wants to Bring Maturity to the Yield Farming Craze,"The Chicago DeFi Alliance, launched in April, is poised to help members make a killing from the recent decentralized finance (DeFi) craze.      So many billions of dollars worth of assets are now cycling through various DeFi projects at such erratic rates that while you’re reading this the estimates are probably changing. Suffice it to say, the Chicago DeFi Alliance now has roughly 55 members, including new additions Binance.US and MakerDAO.      After graduating seven DeFi startups from its first accelerator program this summer, CDA partner Qiao Wang said the organization is now launching a Liquidity Launchpad program to get “informed and professional players in this space” committing their crypto to various protocols.      First, the program vets pre-seed DeFi startups (unlike the accelerator program for slightly more mature startups) with a standardized process that involves audits and traditional measures of professionalism, such as being a registered company. (Some of the food-themed DeFi projects garnering attention today are rough drafts without audits or formal teams.) Then, the CDA does matchmaking of experienced investors, market makers and DeFi builders. Teller Finance, the startup behind a credit and loan management protocol, is the first startup to kick off the launchpad program.      “The teams are validated and the smart contracts are audited. These are long-term, sustainable projects,” CDA and Volt Capital co-founder Imran Khan said during a Google Hangouts interview. “This allows institutional investors to provide liquidity for a fixed amount of time. … We hope to have market makers that are there for the long term, not just the short term.”      Read more: Yearn, YAM and the Rise of Crypto’s ‘Weird DeFi’ Moment    To that end, Teller Finance co-founder Ryan Berkun said the CDA program will help his startup laucnh the lending program with more than $8 million worth of liquidity, thanks to several undisclosed investors. CDA’s traders provide liquidity, continual market making, for a DeFi platform. This gives other users the ability to move money around without steep costs or hassle, letting them dabble in the yield farming of niche tokens that can be played for potential gain. In Teller’s case, providing a loan creates Teller reward tokenshttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/teller-finance-announces-october-launch-130000981.html that can be used for voting.    “We’re starting with governance of your own money, on-chain variables that relate to how money moves and the data gets assessed,” Berkun said. “We’re rolling out progressive decentralization in ways that are similar to Uniswap.”      Users who aren’t financial experts or math students can delegate their voting tokens to an external expert, to vote on their behalf for favorable lending terms. Much like the DeFi protocol Compound, the Teller protocol offers a (mostly) noncustodial way to use assets like ether (ETH) as collateral for loans in stablecoins like DAI or USDC. But Teller is arguably taking a much more involved approach to risk management.    Risk management    So far, Khan said, the retail-driven DeFi experiments have been unnecessarily risky and volatile.      The launchpad offers institutional investors and traders a way to capitalize on the liquidity mining craze, focusing on these vetted projects.      Read more: How Normies Are Getting Crypto-Rich With DeFi      Teller is taking a more heavy-handed approach to credit risk by using the Visa-owned service provider Plaid to assess users’ banking records. Plus, Teller Finance already raised a $1 million venture round since its founding in early 2020, according to the team.      “We’re using the Visa system to securely transmute banking data to the protocol, that helps with making sure the data stays private,” said Teller Finance communications lead Ben Noble.      “If you want to get your credit assessment … you submit your information and the [Teller] nodes come back with an open-source credit assessment,” Berkun said, adding the startup plans to launch the network in October with a small group of permissioned nodes.      These loans can be undercollateralized or even uncollateralized, including an upcoming credit-backed product, so the option of a real credit assessment helps manage or prevent undue risk.      ""It would be a first-of-its kind credit product,"" the Teller team said.      More diverse access to yield farming and different assets will be rolled out slowly, the Teller team said. This token may get listed on various exchanges in the near future, they added, but they want to get “enough tokens in circulating supply before we pull the trigger on that,” Noble said.      That’s what the CDA provides, a regulation-centric roadmap toward healthy circulation.    DeFi matchmaking    While startups gain access and capital from the launchpad, they aren’t subject to the whims of investors the way they might be in a venture capital raise.      CDA backers are expecting to make their own profits using the system, rather than rely on equity for returns. At the same time, launchpad startups can choose to keep their experiments open to the public and only place lockup periods on institutional players. If the institutional backers believe the DeFi startup will be profitable and sustainable, they might accept biased trading terms and as a longer play. Institutional investors have an inherent advantage anyway, since arbitrage strategies benefit from scale.      “Sometimes, you have under-the-radar products that don’t know how to do marketing. They don’t know how to market to retail users or providers. Those retail users are very hype-driven,” Wang said, explaining why social media buzz might highlight the silly DeFi experiments rather than the promising fintech startups. He hopes this launchpad program will counteract that dynamic.      Read more: Why Kyber Network Tokens Tripled to $100M Despite the Coronavirus Recession      While it’s too soon to say what impact CDA will have on broader DeFi trends, the accelerator program just accepted a new batch of participants and alumni reportedly feel satisfied with the experience.      Ming Ng, adviser to the alumni startup Kyber Network, said the imminent Kyber Pro framework for professional market makers “would not be possible without the collaboration with CDA.”      “Imran and Qiao have also been super helpful in matching needs and expertise within the groups,” Ng added.      Perhaps a more mature form of yield farming will emerge from the combination of the launchpad and the second accelerator cohort. After reviewing more than 100 applications, Khan said, the CDA announced its fall cohort: Pods, ParaSwap, Saddle, Notional, Tokenlon, Vega, Derivadex, Perp, Loopring, Deversifi, Mcdex and Acala.      Teller’s Berkun said his startup will collaborate with numerous CDA accelerator participants, offering a vetted white list where users can deploy their new crypto loans.      “The white list provides guardrails as people learn and get used to the system,” added Noble.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | KNC | MARKET | MINING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/09/18/this-defi-group-wants-to-bring-maturity-to-the-yield-farming-craze,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cf358d28b541bb6bc5bda09fdaff1ea16e9f93c0-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384699,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAl8lV,1600432211,Stop F**king Around With Public Token Airdrops in the United States,"Back in 2017, I was the chief operations officer of an enterprise blockchain startup. By all accounts we were a reasonably successful early-stage company; we had built prototypes on our permissioned Ethereum Virtual Machine for a range of banks including Deutsche Bank, Barclays and Credit Suisse. SWIFT built its first prototype blockchain system using our software. Few VCs were interested.      Often, in different meetings with different firms in different countries, all would ask the same question:      “So. Are you doing a token?”      My response was uniform. “Of course I’m not doing a f*!@&ng token, you brain-dead savages,” I would think, before politely responding something along the lines of, “It is my considered opinion that the current practice of raising funds via direct sale to the public is a violation of securities law.” Not that anyone cared, whether they be shiny new VCs or the old and unexciting VCs already in my cap table. After closing a bridge round, my own VCs decided that, indeed, a token sale would be in the company’s future; I left the company to do other things (namely, re-qualify in the U.S.) and the company raised more money.    Preston Byrne, a CoinDesk columnist, is a partner in Anderson Kill's Technology, Media and Distributed Systems Group. These opinions are not legal advice, and do not represent the position of his law firm, partners past or present clients, or itinerant mobs of angry marmots.    In the end, the company didn’t wind up selling any tokens. But at least I got the satisfaction of being right about the whole don’t-sell-tokens-because-you-will-get-dinged-by-the-regulator thing well ahead of time. Back in the heady days of 2014, my friend and expert crypto historian Tim Swanson wrote this op-ed in CoinTelegraph, where he quaintly referred to ICO tokens as “cryptoequity,” per the lingo adopted by Joel Dietz and one of the earliest investment-projects-on-the-blockchain, a decentralized crowdfunding platform called “Swarm.”      Same again in 2017, when I cautioned that the new SAFT note structure – which divided a token issuance into two steps, one private sale and later one public distribution – meant “the SEC can’t nail a company for issuing a SAFT… but the yet-to-be-created tokens remain fair game,” which is exactly what happened when Judge P. Kevin Castel ruled, in Securities and Exchange Commission v. Telegram, Inc. that the tokens and the ostensibly legally compliant “GRAM Purchase Agreements” pursuant to which they were sold constituted a single “scheme” for the purposes of the Securities Act, and therefore the private placement exemptions Telegram thought applied to its offering fell away.      In each of the great s**tcoin booms of the past – 2014 and 2017 – there have been voices who cautioned crypto entrepreneurs to tread carefully and those who have told them to charge ahead. Of the 2014 vintage, only a handful of schemes, which were obviously fraudulent (e.g. PayCoin,) wound up being prosecuted; the PayCoin case led to a multi-million dollar settlement with the SEC and jail time.      Others, like Ethereum, skated; not because they weren’t securities offerings when made but, I suspect, and as Bill Hinman hinted, because the SEC viewed further action as being akin to closing the stable door after the horse had bolted.    There will be s**tcoin apologists in the crypto-legal or crypto-legal-adjacent community, people without clients, who assuredly shout from the rooftops that 'this time it’s different!'    The 2017 boom was met with a somewhat swifter, and broader, response. A number of small schemes like Paragon and Airfox, and decentralized exchanges (DEX) like EtherDelta, were initially targeted in late 2018, with bigger fish like EOS fined in 2019. The picture was confused considerably when Director Bill Hinman of the of the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance made his speech ""When Howey Met Gary (Plastic)"" in June 2018 that seemed to imply functional decentralized networks would be exempt – a view that was later invoked by Kik in defense to the SEC action brought against it nearly a year later, apparently without success. That enforcement wave continues: Only this week, Unikrn was ordered to pay a $6 million penalty and shut down its coin, and numerous other coin issuers from 2017 are doubtless still within the SEC’s crosshairs or negotiating their settlements.      Now, again, in 2020, a new generation of entrepreneurs believes it has found the proverbial Philosopher’s Stone that will turn s**tcoin lead into gold. Members of the “crypto bar” warn the community not to trust lawyers who dare to suggest that this new brand of s**tcoin is categorically out of bounds. Crypto Twitter is abuzz with the usual questions about whether flogging coins for fun and profit that allow voting rights on a DEX is or is not a security.      Whether this is the case will, as with all things, depend on the facts as they fit within the three-prong test from SEC v. W.J. Howey and the precedent that follows it. However, generalizing greatly, more often than not, a coin that airdrops or is pre-sold in vast quantities to American citizens is going to attract attention from American regulators and, as encountered in the wild, is likely to satisfy the Howey prongs.      See also: Redel/Andoni - DeFi Is Just Like the ICO Boom and Regulators Are Circling      As this boom expands, there will be s**tcoin apologists in the crypto-legal or crypto-legal-adjacent community, people without clients, who assuredly shout from the rooftops that 'this time it’s different!' in long Twitter threads optimized for engagement. Other cheerleaders will say that entrepreneurs are leaving money on the table by not doing a Uniswap-style airdrop to the American public, and what a loser you are if you steer clear! Enjoy staying poor!      The facts are these: Not all tokens are securities; this we know from the release of several no-action letters to that effect. But as a practical matter, many, if not most, of them will be. No mental gymnastics, no think pieces, no cryptographic magic dust, no novel naming conventions, and no “gotchas!” can work around the fact that courts work with economic reality, and economic reality on this most recent DEX token airdrop looks a lot like an investment contract.      It is also true that there are, without a doubt, countries in the world that do countenance token offerings. Go there. U.S. securities laws are not meant to restrict the sale of tokens in those places. In the wake of the Telegram case, however, there can be no doubt – none whatsoever – that there are serious restrictions on engaging in token sale activity in the U.S., which includes airdrops, and which also include airdrops relating to DEXs.      See also: Preston Byrne - Telegram’s TON Was Built on Sand. Its Failure Isn’t All Bad For Crypto      Many of us would prefer this not be the case. I count myself among them. A liberal token-offering regime in the U.S. would create much more legal work for cryptocurrency-literate transactional lawyers. That this is the case may result in American startups having less adoption and less access to capital.      This notwithstanding, it is the case, and if you want to avoid spending years in litigation with the federal government, I suggest approaching this market with a cool head and not giving into the temptation – or pressure – to “do something” to maximize your exploitation of it.      The SEC may not move today nor tomorrow nor even a year from now in relation to any particular issuance. Nor is there a requirement that cash change hands for the issuance to be deemed a sale. The SEC’s guidance has cautioned that so-called “airdrops” can fall within this rubric. Consideration is not just money – it can be work, effort and the attendant increase in value that arises from it.      The SEC’s slowness – the fact that it has done nothing about Uniswap right now – is not a waiver of its enforcement powers, and being on the receiving end of one of its subpoenas is no less painful simply because it waited a few years to hit you with it.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | AIRDROP | TOKEN SALE,Preston J.

42384711,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAl8vZ,1600430987,Bitcoin Rises Back to $11K Despite Signs of Indecision in the Market,"Bitcoin is again looking to establish a foothold above $11,000 on Friday, although the technical charts are anything but stridently bullish.    The leading cryptocurrency by market value is trading just over $11,000 at press time, having found bids below $10,800 on Thursday, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  Buyers, however, have been struggling to keep prices above $11,000 over the last few days.  The cryptocurrency clocked highs of $11,104 and $11,050 on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, but printed a UTC closing price below $11,000 on both occasions.  Notably, bitcoin created a doji candle on Thursday, as it swung both ways before ending the day on a flat note.  A doji shows both buyers and sellers are not willing to lead the price action.  However, new investors are entering the market at a faster pace and one may expect bitcoin to post sustainable gains above $11,000.  On the other hand, on-chain analyst Cole Garner believes the recent spike in bitcoin outflows from miner wallets to exchanges is a cause for concern for traders expecting a continued price recovery.  According to data source Glassnode, 1,113.85 BTC were transferred to exchange wallets from miner wallets on Sept. 13 – the biggest single day outflow since December.  An increased supply of bitcoin moving onto exchanges suggests increased selling pressure.  So far, however, bitcoin has largely remained resilient and is up 6% this week.  This may have been helped by investors moving money out of alternative cryptocurrencies and into bitcoin, according to Patrick Heusser, a senior cryptocurrency trader at Zurich-based Crypto Broker AG, told CoinDesk in a Twitter chat.  Indeed, major alternative cryptocurrencies such as ether (ETH), bitcoin cash (BCH) and litecoin (LTC) have depreciated by 2% to 5% against bitcoin in the past seven days. Chainlink's LINK token is down 17%, according to data source Messari.  Should the latest indecisive price action end with an upward move, the focus would shift to the next hurdle at $11,200. That level served as strong support in August.  Thursday's low of $10,765 is the level to defend for the bulls.

42384691,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAl8ch,1600428937,Twitter Tightens Security Ahead of US Presidential Election,"High-profile users on Twitter will be told to up their account security as the platform looks to prevent hacks and protect ""unique sensitivities"" in the run-up to the 2020 U.S. presidential election.    The social media site said in a post Friday that certain Twitter accounts will be required to use strong passwords and will only be able to reset them if they supply identifying information, such as an email or a phone number.  It will also roll out a series of internal security safeguards to better detect malicious activity and attempts to take over accounts.  Although not mentioned explicitly, Twitter alludes to the fact that it has been victim to serious security incidents before.  Earlier this year, a teenager masterminded a coordinated attack on 30 high-profile Twitter users, including CoinDesk's, that hijacked accounts and sent messages promising to double the money of users who sent cryptocurrency.  The attack targeted major U.S. political figures, including Democrat candidate Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama.  In a separate attack just two weeks ago, hackers hijacked a Twitter account of Narenda Modi, the prime minister of India, sending messages that asked for cryptocurrency donations.  Available to everyone, the new security measures will be compulsory for accounts considered influential in the upcoming election – such as U.S. government officials, candidates standing for office as well as major newspapers and high-profile political journalists.  In order to prevent misinformation spreading on its platform, Twitter has already introduced warning labels for tweets it believes are either misleading or unsubstantiated.  It has even flagged tweets from U.S. President Donald Trump, one of its most notable and perhaps controversial users.  Twitter has a pivotal role in crypto – it's where many businesses and projects communicate major news announcements to their followers and where major debates, like that surrounding the Bitcoin Cash hard fork, take place.

Data collected from Etherscan shows miners collected a total 42,763 ether in transaction fees on Thursday, a new all-time high.  That's currently worth nearly $16.5 million, according to CoinDesk data.  That comes as daily volumes on Ethereum surged nearly 400,000 on Thursday to 1.4 million transactions, also smashing the previous 1.34 million record reached in January 2018.  Activity has skyrocketed in the past year as the hype around decentralized finance, which is mostly built on Ethereum, has reached fever pitch.  Statistics site DeFi Prime shows monthly volumes for decentralized exchanges, which include Uniswap, Curve and Balancer, surged nearly $4 billion to a total of $16 billion by Sept. 1.  At the start of the year, combined volumes barely reached $600 million.  There is currently over $9 billion worth of assets locked in DeFi applications, according to DeFi Pulse, up from approximately $675 million at the start of the year.  Earlier this week, Tether moved 1 billion worth of USDT – a stablecoin supported on many DeFi applications – from the Tron to the Ethereum ecosystem on behalf of an unnamed exchange, the second such billion-dollar swap in the past month.

The CSBS announced a “One Company, One Exam” plan Tuesday whereby states will coordinate their supervisory exams for the nation’s largest payment firms in an effort to reduce the costs on both state regulators and the companies they oversee. Essentially, the exam is how these regulators will make sure regulated entities are still in compliance.      What this means for cryptocurrency companies – such as Coinbase – is their compliance costs will drop. Rather than work with more than 50 different state and territory regulators, the exchanges only need to check in with the one group. The group of regulators includes every state but Montana, which doesn’t have a money transmission license.      Crypto exchanges need money transmission licenses to legally operate within most states, with the state banking or financial services regulator overseeing this form of regulated activity.      “For the industry that means there’s going to be a reduction in regulatory burden,” said Matt Lambert, nonbank counsel for CSBS.      However, new exchanges will still have to apply for, and secure, a license for each state in which they hope to operate. While the CSBS is working on a potential standard for applications, there’s still a long way to go.      At present the move also only applies to the 78 largest money transmitters in the U.S. – those operating in at least 40 states. While Lambert declined to identify which crypto businesses fit into this category, a search of the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System & Registry database indicates this could include Coinbase, Circle Internet Financial and Square.      The list of firms that will benefit from CSBS’ announcement could still grow. While there aren’t any plans right now to add to the list of companies, Lambert said more could be added later on.    ‘Strictest standards’    The CSBS announced its effort to consolidate supervision at least partly as a result of soliciting feedback from the crypto industry, and finding that regulated entities believed “there is too much supervision that is accomplishing the same thing,” Lambert said.      “Overall I think this process will lead to high standards, the strictest standards,” he said. “This is not going to be a means of defaulting to the lowest standards, this is going to be a method of raising the bar for everyone.”      Each exam will be conducted by a group of state regulators, and the makeup of the group will change on an exam-by-exam basis. This lets the regulators coordinate among themselves to find the best fit for each company’s evaluation.

Daniel Gorfine, the former fintech innovation lead at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and a director with the Digital Dollar Project, told CoinDesk the move helps in the development of regulations around fintech.      “This approach would be similar to the dual banking system, which recognizes state and federally chartered banks and has been effective in safely promoting competition, innovation and choice both for consumers as well as industry,” he said.      Linda Lacewell, Superintendent of the New York Department of Financial Services, echoed his view, saying on Twitter a dual banking system is needed as states better understand their local ecosystems.    Lowered costs    By coordinating, the states are able to save their own resources.      Lambert said the different states will be able to reduce their supervisory costs because they won’t have to conduct every exam.      “If you only have one exam nationwide you can make sure the best examiners are at that exam and can leverage the resources of the states,” he said.      Lacewell said on Twitter the move would also “reduce burdens on the industry.”      Regulated companies will also find their own bills reduced, said Brian Nistler, an attorney with Lowenstein Sandler. He told CoinDesk the first effect is “an overdue reduction in compliance costs and regulatory redundancies for money service businesses and the state regulators.”      Read more: The OCC’s Crypto Custody Letter Was Years in the Making      This is especially important because costs for the crypto industry have “ballooned” over the last few years, he said. As a result, entities have been asking for the exams to be streamlined for some time now.      Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire agreed, saying in a statement the move would streamline his company’s efforts to work with state banking regulators.      He said the new framework indicates “very significant progress for crypto and fintech firms.”      “[It ensures] that there is a consistent and well-run process for examining firms and ensuring that they can meet their regulatory obligations,” he said.    National framework    What Tuesday’s announcement does not do is create a national framework for crypto companies. However, it is the latest move in a years-long effort to more closely coordinate between the states, Lambert said.      “The states have been working together in the supervision of money transmitters for a long time. Originally it was through the money transmitter regulators association and they continue to work through the states,” he said.      A possible next step may come through the creation of a multi-state licensing agreement. This project, which has also been in the works for some time, has about 29 states on board so far.      It’s unclear whether such an effort would negate the need for a federal charter, as Acting Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks has suggested. As detailed, his proposed charter would allow fintech firms to bypass the state-by-state framework entirely.      Read more: US Regulator to Shake Up Banking With Federal Charters for Payment Firms      Nistler noted that when the states were writing their various money transmitter license regulations, “no one thought the states would be responsible for regulating borderless online platforms,” which was a view Gorfine shared.      Kristin Smith, the executive director of the Blockchain Association, said a national framework or federal law is still needed. “It makes little sense to have a patchwork of regulation and supervision,” she said.      Brooks congratulated CSBS for its announcement, but also indicated he agrees with the idea of a federal authority overseeing payment firms.      “While the efforts alleviate some of the inherent challenges facing a system based on 50 state laws and licensing regimes, only federal law and the uniform regulatory framework it provides fully addresses these issues,” he said in a statement.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/09/18/how-us-states-are-and-arent-easing-crypto-firms-compliance-burden,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/224e758f68385cf45562b8b6be852abdd65e1bc8-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to the post, CAFA intends to build a ""farm to table"" traceability system across China that would record the various stages of the food supply process on the blockchain in order to build trust with consumers.

VeChain will assist the alliance in the development of its platform by connecting member organizations within China's food supply chain and offering technical support.

According to a report by The Sydney Morning Herald on Friday, Jonathan Khoo, 34, worked as a contractor for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).  Between January and February 2018, Khoo implemented code in two supercomputers for the purpose of mining cryptocurrency for his own personal financial gain.  Khoo was able to mine ether and monero worth a reported A$9,420 (US$6,897), which he deposited into his own personal wallets.  The CSIRO estimated Khoo's illegal mining pursuits cost the agency A$76,668 (US$56,133) worth of computing power and other resources.  Magistrate Erin Kennedy handed Khoo a 15-month intensive correction order on Friday; he will serve out his sentence via 300 hours of community service plus counseling.  After being discovered in February 2018, Australian federal police issued a search warrant and arrested Khoo later that month, the report said.  His actions ""diverted"" valuable computing power resources away from ""significant scientific research,"" federal police cybercrime operations commander Chris Goldsmid said, including ""data array analysis, medical research and climate modeling work.""  The disgraced employee's lawyer told the local court that Khoo had no prior offenses and was remorseful for his actions.  Magistrate Kennedy on handing down the sentence acknowledged Khoo's guilty plea, but noted it was significant the CSIRO had been targeted and said Khoo's sentence had to act as a general deterrent.  In Australia, the maximum penalty for the crime – unauthorized modification of data to cause impairment – carries a sentence of 10 years imprisonment.

The two companies partnered to offer rewards to customers last year.    According to a bitFlyer report featured in a CoinDesk Japan article Thursday, the exchange did not specify the number of users of the service. But BTC was trading at 1.3 million Japanese yen ($12,400) in August for the first time in a year  Midori Kanemitsu, a market analyst at bitFlyer, indicated this reflects a larger trend: against the backdrop of COVID-19 and global monetary easing, bitcoin is shifting from a speculative investment for individuals to an institutional hedge against inflation.  Kanemitsu also expects institutional investors to enter the Japanese bitcoin market.  A bitFlyer survey conducted earlier this year revealed that 30% of new visitors to the exchange are in their 20s, and that number has doubled since a previous survey conducted in 2018.  The rewards system, launched in August 2019, allows users who have a bitFlyer account to exchange T-points for BTC.  Users can also earn one T-point for every 500 yen (~$4.80) spent in BTC at participating member stores.
