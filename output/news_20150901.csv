42398644,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbdAz4,1441139574,UK Government Exploring Use of Blockchain Recordkeeping,"The UK government is exploring the use of blockchain technology in a bid to improve the transparency and accuracy of its record keeping.  In a post on the blog of the Government Digital Service, a unit of the UK Cabinet Office, technical architect Paul Downey explains that his team has been examining registers – how they are currently formatted and managed, and how they could potentially be improved through the use of a blockchain.  The post details the different types of register that are currently maintained by the government, including open, closed and private registers. It continues:  “We’ve spent a lot of time looking at a large number of such lists, and what’s become apparent is that they’re all held and maintained quite differently. That causes problems.""  One such problem is the delay that exists between a change being made to data on a register and that change being made available to users of the service. This exists with registers that cannot be accessed directly through an API.  Data integrity  Downey goes on to say that a more important issue is that of data integrity, which relies upon each register having a reliable registrar and method of recording and updating the data in question.  The perfect register “should be able to prove the data hasn’t been tampered with” and should store a history of the changes that have been made, plus “be open to independent scrutiny”, he argues.  In response to a comment on the post questioning how government-issued licences, certificates and other documents could be stored to assist should there be discrepancies over the data in the record, Downey suggests that blockchain technology could, potentially, provide a solution.  “We are aware of how protocols such as the blockchain demonstrate how proofs could be distributed,"" he writes.  However, Downey concedes this is just one of a number of different models his team has started to explore with the aim of increasing “the trust in integrity of record”.  Thought leading  The proposal has drawn initial support from some corners of the digital currency community in the UK.  A spokesperson for the UK Digital Currency Association lauded the government's initiative in exploring such concepts. They went on to say there is “no better way” to deliver a public register than through a blockchain. These can be used to transparently record public lists of data, “from land registries to licensed pub landlords”.  The spokesperson concluded:  “In the developing world, the blockchain is a necessity to regularise title and ownership; in the developed, it is all about efficiency and ease of access.”  Archives image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/09/01/uk-government-exploring-use-of-blockchain-recordkeeping,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6c8d6f3666157890459c9bbfa48eae9b3ec440c6-1500x988.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398630,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbdApE,1441132517,Bitcoin Developers Pen Open Letter on Network Scalability,"More than 30 Bitcoin Core developers and contributors have signed an open letter to the bitcoin community about the process of reaching a technical consensus for bitcoin scalability.  Signatories on the list include current Bitcoin Core maintainer Wladimir van der Laan, Blockstream co-founder Pieter Wuille, tree chains developer Peter Todd and litecoin creator Charlie Lee, though former Bitcoin Core maintainer Gavin Andresen and bitcoinJ developer Mike Hearn are notably absent.  The letter follows weeks of heated debate regarding whether the network should be augmented to allow for more transactions to be processed per block. The current version of Bitcoin Core processes blocks approximately every 10 minutes, with a data limit of 1MB.  Andresen and Hearn are separately pursuing an implementation of the bitcoin network called Bitcoin XT. Bitcoin XT would raise the block size limit to 8MB, with this limit increasing over time, and has emerged as an alternative to Bitcoin Core.  Though Bitcoin XT is not referenced in the letter, it begins by claiming bitcoin creator Satoshi's intention was for bitcoin's code to be continually improved through a process of ""review and cooperation"".  It goes on to say:  ""We’re committed to bitcoin and responsive to the needs of the community. For the past five years, we’ve written code and managed over 50 bitcoin releases and reviewed more than 45 formal proposals to improve bitcoin’s performance, security, and scalability. Technical discussions, while heated at times, are always focused on improving bitcoin.""  Collaborative approach  The authors sought to make the case that Bitcoin Core has made already significant improvements to address scalability, including improving network efficiency and algorithmic scaling.  Further, the letter sought to frame alternative versions of the bitcoin network as those that deviate from an existing, already successful process that has seen the network grow to hold $3.3bn in value.  ""There will be controversy from time to time, but Bitcoin is a security-critical system with billions of dollars of users’ assets that a mistake could compromise,"" the letter reads, cautioning:  ""To mitigate potential existential risks, it behooves us all to take the time to evaluate proposals that have been put forward and agree on the best solutions via the consensus-building process.""  Workshops scheduled  Many of bitcoin's devs and contributors will be attending two open workshops, called Scaling Bitcoin. The first is being held in Montreal on 12th-13th September and the second workshop is planned for early December in Hong Kong.  The event mirrors others held by the usually decentralized bitcoin community, including a summit of key bitcoin mining groups held at last year's CoinSummit London. That event, held at the time of broad concern over mining pool centralization, led to a commitment by then-market leader Ghash to commit to reducing its scale.  Overall, the message sought to convey that such an approach to a network solution would represent the community ""working together"" in a manner that has not been pursued by other solutions.  The letter concludes:  ""We believe this is the way forward and reinforces the existing review process that has served the bitcoin development community (and bitcoin in general) well to date.""

42398624,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbdAiL,1441101669,US Silk Road Agent Pleads Guilty to Money Laundering,"A US secret service agent who stole $820,000 worth of bitcoin pled guilty yesterday to money laundering and obstruction of justice.  Shaun W Bridges was part of an investigation into Silk Road, an black marketplace hosted on the deep web, which allowed people to sell illegal drugs in return for bitcoin.  In his plea agreement, Bridges, 32, of Laurel, Maryland, admitted to moving 20,000 BTC (worth around $350,000 at the time) from Silk Road accounts to a wallet he controlled.  He did this in January 2013 by using an administrator account to reset passwords and pins of a number of accounts on the site.  Shortly after Bridges stole the bitcoins, he moved them to an account he had with the now-bankrupt Japanese bitcoin exchange Mt Gox.  Between March and May 2013, he changed the bitcoins into dollars, totalling $820,000, transferring the funds to a personal investment account with Fidelity.  In June 2014, Bridges transferred money to a personal bank account he shared with another person.  “Mr Bridges has now admitted that he brazenly stole $820,000 worth of digital currency while working as a US Secret Service special agent, a move that completely violated the public’s trust,” said US Attorney Melinda Haag.  Richard Weber, chief of IRS-Criminal Investigation described the case as an “excellent example of the financial expertise of our special agents”.  He added:  “Through the analysis of both the blockchain and data from the Silk Road servers, we were able to trace the flow of funds, which eventually led to the defendant.”  Bridges is set to be sentenced on 7th December and the maximum penalty for each count is 20 years and a $250,000 fine.

42398645,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbdB03,1441098278,Inside the Movement to Build a Bitcoin-Powered Reddit,"Furor over management decisions, an abrupt CEO exit, a rising competitor.  The last few months haven't been kind to Reddit, the social networking giant that raised $50m in new funding in September from an A-list cast of VC firms including Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital alongside angel investors including Snoop Dogg and Peter Thiel.  However, if one former employee and bitcoin developer succeeds on his vision, Reddit's biggest challenge could be a decentralized, bitcoin-based alternative. Called DATT (short for Decentralize All the Things), the still-in-development social network recently held a global hackathon on 1st August aimed at kickstarting the project.  Project leader Ryan X Charles, who was previously hired by Reddit to helm its short-lived cryptocurrency initiative, suggested that work on the idea is pressing forward, and that a prototype of the project is expected soon, providing CoinDesk a glimpse at what his team of 10 part-time developers have so far built.  Charles suggested the project, kickstarted by a 5th July blog post that convinced him to leave his post at bitcoin security firm BitGo, could become a more ""more professional"" version of the social platform all too easily overtaken by frivolous bickering.  In short, he said, it might not look like Reddit at all if successful.  Charles told CoinDesk:  ""I don't think we'll replace Reddit. We'll make something different that services a different need. By integrating payments, it will feel different than Reddit. As soon as people have incentive to host good content, this will change the dynamic.""  Though much about the exact design of DATT remains to be determined (and currently lies in uncompleted GitHub form), the open-source project is so far built around a series of principles, that the network be uncensorable, feature strong anonymity and require nothing more than a web browser to operate.  The principals were developed at the hackathon, held in a distributed manner across Buenos Aires, Bombay and San Francisco. It saw some 100 participants take part in, or at least investigate, a Slack group for the weekend-long brainstorming session on how the project could be developed, designed and marketed.  ""We did quite a lot of stuff in one weekend,"" Charles said.  Professional destiny  Throughout the interview, Charles framed the project as one that serves as a culmination of his professional skills. He says he's always wanted to start a business and is uniquely suited to creating a product like Reddit, having spent a short time at the company.  ""The pieces all fell into place and I have the right skill set, it's exactly the type of company I'd want to start,"" he said, recalling the series of events that led former CEO Ellen Pao to be replaced by co-founder Steve Huffman.  ""I thought about my time at Reddit and realized that some of the stuff I was working on had the potential to fix problems with Reddit, and the validation [from the blog post response] was big enough for me to pursue it full time,"" he continued.  Charles indicated a handful of investors are interested in the project, having reached out after his blog entry received widespread media coverage.  The post wasn't so much critical of his former employer as a referendum on social media platforms in general, which, in his words, ""focus a little more time converting content into money ... and a little less on building better tools"" for users.  Under the original vision, users will pay to download and upvote content to the website, with bitcoin being used as the currency to incentivize all the parties – readers, writers, moderators and developers – to keep producing valuable content.  ""Any user can run a business by running the app full-time,"" the post explained. ""Any user, including Reddit, Inc, can censor content they themselves deliver to other users, but cannot censor content other users send to other users.""  Users would pay content creators through votes, while creators would add posts and comments, in turn paying moderators for hosting the content. Node operators would then pay moderators who would finally pay DATT at a percentage determined by nodes.  Project developers argue this will financially incentivize mods to increase the number of votes, and that nodes would be motivated to provide mods ""friendly policies around censorship"".  Power to the people  As for how the project will aim to improve on Reddit, Charles was quick to downplay decentralization as a ""technical detail"", as opposed to something that would be the main value-add of the service.  Charles suggested that DATT's most important feature will be its ability to return ownership of content to the site's users, who he said will be free to publish their own comments or content.  [post-quote]  ""If some moderator doesn't like them, then the moderator shouldn't be able to ban them from the experience,"" Charles explained. ""With Reddit, the moderator can moderate in a community, but users can be shadowbanned or mistreated by mods and the mods mistreated by the company.""  He's clear in his critique of the service and what it hopes to change, adding: ""The way the ownership works on Reddit is that, in effect, the company owns everything.""  With DATT, moderators would in turn be able to host multiple versions of the content published through the platform, effectively creating different versions of the same content streams. DATT nodes will connect to the platform's peer-to-peer network, broadcasting content for download.  Though this might lead usability to suffer, Charles said content creators will be able to take their content elsewhere if they feel slighted.  ""Even if a Reddit user is a perfectly good user, but they make the wrong mod angry, they can lose access to their content or their account unjustly, and there's no recourse other than leaving Reddit,"" he continued. ""If they go to [Reddit alternative] Voat they have to start over.""  Building blocks  DATT won't be built completely from scratch, however, as Charles indicated the project will seek to use other open-source technologies.  In particular, Charles said DATT's stackhttps://github.com/dattnetwork/dattdocs/blob/master/datt-stack.png will leverage Bitcore, BitPay's open-source JavaScript bitcoin library, and the payments channels platform developed by the open-source livestreaming platform Streamium, which enables real-time micropayments.  Resources on the project's GitHub suggest the project may eventually implement the Lightning Network, a proposal to add payment channels to bitcoin, should it be developed.  For now, the project will be built on bitcoin due to the additional developer resources that are already available, with payments and proof of ownership handled on its blockchain.  ""We're using the bitcoin blockchain for payments, [and] we're going to use the bitcoin blockchain for putting the hash of your content on the blockchain, so someone can query if content exists even if they can't download it,"" he said.  As for the user experience, Charles indicated it was his goal for DATT to serve as an onboarding tool for new bitcoin users, meaning users won't have to pay to create content.  ""That's how the bootstrapping problem is solved,"" he stated. ""Write compelling content and people who do have money would be willing to pay for it. So long as we can draw some bitcoin users, the rest of the people will be able to earn bitcoin by using the app.""  Hurdles remain  As of now, Charles is optimistic a prototype of the platform, complete with payments and comments features, will be in place sometime in September. A minimum viable product (MVP), he suggested, could be as many as three months away from this milestone.  ""We don't want to build something really complicated that doesn't solve the problem, so we're trying to carefully move in the direction of enabling users to own [and sell] content,"" he said.  The MVP, as currently described, would feature a light node and a full node, with traditional bitcoin transactions being used in lieu of any payment systems.  Of course, Charles is cognizant of the challenges ahead. Monetizing any content from consumer payments remains a challenge, even for the most well-capitalized publishers in an age where readers expect content to be subsidized by advertising.  Further, while he suggested bitcoin enables micropayments for perhaps the first time in history, he acknowledges the idea has been around for some time, always failing to take flight.  ""You can say the same thing about any idea, sometimes companies fail,"" he said in response to this line of questioning. ""I think the thing is we have to execute correctly.""  Still, he expressed optimism that DATT would become useful for an early batch of users, whether disaffected Reddit participants or even professional writers and content creators, and that the project has a unique combination of factors that could propel it to success.  Charles believes he has at least one advantage that could skew the results, concluding:  ""The earlier projects didn't have the technology.""
