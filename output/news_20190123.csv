42402474,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJw0Z,1548279944,"US Government Shutdown Derailed Bitcoin ETF Talks, Says VanEck CEO","A closely-watched proposal to list a bitcoin exchange-traded fund on the Cboe BZX Exchange was withdrawn Wednesday – and the ongoing partial shutdown of the U.S. government appears to be to blame.  As CoinDesk reported, the filing was ""temporarily withdrawn"", according to VanEck VanEck director of digital asset strategy Gabor Gurbacs. He also said that ""we are actively working with regulators and major market participants to build appropriate market structure frameworks for a Bitcoin ETF and digital assets in general.""  But Jan van Eck, the chief executive officer of VanEck, indicated on CNBC Wednesday that the shutdown's impact on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) hampered the process between regulators and those seeking the ETF's approval. According to van Eck, the discussions around the proposal – initially submitted last June and subject to subsequent approval delays – ""had to stop.""  Speaking to CNBC's Bob Pisani, van Eck explained:  ""So, you know the SEC is affected by the shutdown...we were engaged in discussions with the SEC about the bitcoin-related issues, custody, market manipulation, prices, and that had to stop. And so, instead of trying to slip through or something, we just had the application pulled and we will re-file and re-engage in the discussions when the SEC gets going again.""  Pressed by Pisani on whether the proposal would have been rejected anyway due to concerns about custody and bitcoin's pricing, van Eck added that ""we think we actually have pretty solid answers to those [questions], but we just need to really demonstrate it very, very clearly and convincingly to the regulators.""  ""We were trying to do that but we obviously can't have meetings while they're shut down,"" he added.  Jake Chervinsky, a lawyer with Kobre & Kim, told CoinDesk that, in his view, that ""the ETF sponsors made the right decision to withdraw their proposal,"" going on to note that ""the shutdown was the final nail in the ETF's coffin, since the SEC doesn't have enough staff members available to review or approve any proposed rule changes right now.""  ""Withdrawing the proposal stops the SEC from issuing another order saying the bitcoin markets aren't ready for an ETF. The decision to withdraw is a decision to 'live to fight another day' – Jan Van Eck has said he will re-file the proposal after the shutdown, so he probably wanted to avoid setting a new precedent that would make it harder to succeed in the future,"" Chervinsky wrote in an email.  The partial shutdown, which affects a number of government departments including the U.S. Treasury (of which the SEC is a part), began on Dec. 22 following disagreements over the funding of a proposed wall on the U.S.-Mexico border sought by U.S. President Donald Trump. It is the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.  Caught in the crossfire  of the shutdown are a number of other projects in the crypto space, including bitcoin futures platform Bakkt and crypto trading platform ErisX, both of which are waiting for the Commodity Futures Exchange Commission – an independent U.S. agency that has also been affected by the funding lapse – for approvals.

42402465,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJvsh,1548278498,Lawmakers Pitch New Crypto Tax Payments Bill in New Hampshire,"A pair of New Hampshire lawmakers filed a bill this month that, if approved, would let state-level agencies accept cryptocurrencies as payment, including the state's tax office.  Representatives Dennis Acton and Michael Yakubovich introduced House Bill 470 on Jan. 3, which seeks to require New Hampshire's state agencies accept cryptocurrencies for taxes and other fees through a third-party entity.  If passed, the bill would give the state treasurer until Nov. 1, 2019 to develop a plan for these agencies to begin integrating such payments.  Under current New Hampshire regulations, only U.S. dollars may be accepted by state agencies for payments at present, and any other currencies used would be returned to the sender. If the bill passes, it would allow these agencies to accept an undetermined number and type of cryptocurrencies through ""an appropriate third party payment processor that will process cryptocurrency transactions at no cost to the state.""  ""Assuming legislation is approved to amend this statute, the issues of valuation and currency risk are heightened by the volatility of cryptocurrency (bitcoin) fluctuations in value against the U.S. dollar,"" the bill's text explains, going on to state:  ""Tax payments received by the state would need to be converted to U.S. dollars or alternatively, mitigate such risk by continually monitoring cryptocurrency levels held by the state to ensure there is as much demand for state payments to vendors and payees as the state has in its 'inventory'.""  If implemented, New Hampshire agencies would start accepting cryptocurrencies on July 1, 2020. A hearing was scheduled for Jan. 23, according to public records, but as of press time, there is no recording of that hearing yet available.  Past bill didn't pass  New Hampshire's legislature has previously debated the merits of accepting bitcoin for taxes. A 2015 bill directed the state to partner with a bitcoin startup to accept payments made using the cryptocurrency.  Public records indicated at the time that the bill died in committee, having previously faced opposition from some lawmakers at the time. Other efforts, in states like Arizona, had progressed before falling to the wayside as well.  Should New Hampshire pass the measure, the state would join Ohio in accepting bitcoin payments. The Buckeye State announced last year that it would accept bitcoin for taxes through an online portal.  Ohio partnered with BitPay to convert any bitcoins submitted into U.S. dollars. It is unclear how many companies have done so to date, though digital retailer Overstock became the first major firm to do so earlier this year.  On Jan. 3, the company announced it would pay a portion of its 2019 taxes using bitcoin.

42402475,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJw1Y,1548273423,Cboe Exchange Withdraws Proposal for VanEck-SolidX Bitcoin ETF,"The Cboe BZX Exchange has withdrawn a proposed rule change that, if approved, would clear the way for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) backed by VanEck and SolidX.  In a notice published Wednesday, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) deputy secretary Eduardo Aleman wrote that the Cboe BZX Exchange had pulled its proposed rule change, which would have allowed it to list shares of the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust if approved. The exchange filed its withdrawal on Jan. 22.  The proposal was filed last June, when VanEck, an investment firm, teamed up with financial services provider SolidX to provide a physically-backed bitcoin ETF to the market (other such proposals have relied on bitcoin futures contracts, rather than the cryptocurrency's price itself).  The SEC delayed any decision on the proposal a number of times, asking for public comment and taking meetings with proponents. The regulator faced a final decision deadline of Feb. 27.  While the notice itself did not provide a reason for the withdrawal, some securities lawyers speculated that the ongoing government shutdown would result in the ETF being denied, as no staffers at the SEC are able to review the proposed rule change.  In an email, VanEck director of digital asset strategy Gabor Gurbacs told CoinDesk that the filing ""has been temporarily withdrawn.""  ""We are actively working with regulators and major market participants to build appropriate market structure frameworks for a Bitcoin ETF and digital assets in general,"" he said.  VanEck CEO Jan van Eck told CNBC earlier Wednesday that the proposal was being withdrawn and would be submitted at a later date following continued discussions with the SEC – yet those talks were essentially put on hold as a result of the ongoing partial government shutdown in the U.S.  ""We were engaged in discussions with the SEC about the bitcoin-related issues, custody, market manipulation, prices, and that had to stop. And so, instead of trying to slip through or something, we just had the application pulled and we will re-file when the SEC gets going again,"" van Eck told the network.  In a previous interview with CoinDesk, attorney Ethan Silver, chair of the broker-dealer practice at Lowenstein Sandler, explained that ""if [the SEC] were forced to deal with [the proposal], they would sooner deny it than be put in a position [where it is approved on a technicality].""

42402471,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJvxc,1548264914,'Decentralized Airbnb' Starts Charging Fees as ICO Model Falters,"Bee Token – a crypto startup seeking to create a decentralized home-sharing platform – has begun charging fees for some customers as part of a pivot meant to boost revenues.  It's a significant development for the company, which raised millions in an ICO as an alternative to Airbnb that could cut costs for users by reducing fees and eliminating ads from online services.  But Bee found that users haven't been moving to its site fast enough.  Now, the company, founded by Uber alumni, is moving to a more traditional path to sustainability, according to an interview with co-founder and CEO Jonathan Chou.  The company announced the closure of its ICO in early February 2018, raising 5,000 ETH (roughly $4.5 million as the sale closed). Of the total supply of 500 million BEE tokens, 213 million are in circulation. The coin had a market cap of around $11 million in April, but the total value currently sits at less than $500,000.  Chou told CoinDesk in interview:  ""It's definitely a pivot. The focus is to have a sustainable revenue model.""  The company has also shed staff in recent months. While Bee Token employed 20 people in the early part of last year, it's currently a team of just 10.  Chou says most of the people who are now gone were employed making the token sale happen, though he added that three people have transitioned out due to the changing nature of the business.  What had to change  Bee Token set out to create a protocol for home-sharing, one in which the company's work building the system would be repaid through the rising value of its token supply. But Airbnb, it turns out, has a very big advantage: instant brand recognition with consumers.  The thinking at the time went like this: as more and more users of the platform purchased BEE in order to pay for stays in people's homes, the more valuable the team's compensation package would be. This token model was typical of companies conducting ICOs in 2017 and early 2018.  Bee Token's website promises zero commissions on bookings through the site.  According to the Bee Token white paper, centralized services charge anywhere from 3 to 15 percent commission, depending on various factors. The theory was that by eliminating these fees, Bee's home-sharing approach would be competitive with industry leader Airbnb and similar sites.  This vision has not been realized as quickly as hoped, Chou said, though he doesn't intend to go back on his commitment to users.  ""We are currently 0 percent for the crypto consumer,"" Chou explained. ""We still have a lot of crypto and blockchain companies that use us for travel.""  That said, the company's emphasis today is to win over traditional business travelers. These customers are less cost-conscious than consumers, so Bee will charge 8 percent commission on businesses that use the site. That's still competitive with the company's chief competitors, Chou said.  Web3 on hold?  Despite the setback in vision, Chou estimates the team currently has a one-year runway. That's why Bee Token is currently working to raise a seed round.  ""We are pivoting to be a more revenue-focused business,"" Chou told CoinDesk. Investors want to see money coming in, he said, adding: ""Cash is king.""  Chou situated his company's pivot within the broader context of crypto's ebbs and flows over the last two years. ""Most ICOs in 2017, the more decentralized you were, the more perfect you were,"" Chou said.  Then came 2018: a year of shock after shock. Many companies didn't react because they didn't know if the market would come back.  Now in 2019, Chou said, only the biggest tokens – the ones with market caps in the top 10 or so, can afford their burn on those grounds alone.  Either the smaller ICOs pivot, he said, or ""basically, you are just waiting to die.""

42402468,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJvuf,1548259203,A16z-backed Startup Anchor Labs Launches Crypto Custodial Service,"A crypto startup has launched a custodial service for institutions that it claims is more secure than cold storage yet offers easier access to assets.  Anchor Labs, which previously raised $17 million in a series A round backed by Andreessen Horowitz, Max Levchin, Khosla Ventures, Blackrock's Mark McCombe, Elad Gil and AngelList co-founder Naval Ravikant, announced the launch of Anchorage, a digital asset custodian, on Wednesday.  Anchorage says it can deliver ""all the benefits of asset accessibility,"" which include capturing the yield from staking a cryptocurrency, voting, confirming proof of existence and faster transactions.  The company was co-founded by Diogo Mónica and Nathan McCauley, who previously worked on Square's encrypted credit card reader and ran Docker's security team.  ""Until now, investors have been constrained by the limitations of 'cold storage' custody, which is vulnerable to human error (or worse), and holds assets inaccessibly so they are slow to move and can't be used to capture yield, which can lead to depreciation due to dilution over time,"" they wrote in a Medium post.  Mónica and McCauley said in their blog post that there is institutional interest in the crypto space, but that any firms looking to store their assets have had to make a tradeoff ""between security and asset productivity.""  Indeed, this tradeoff has led several cold storage custodians, such as BitGo and Kingdom Trust, to form partnerships with liquidity providers in which trades can be executed quickly without the coins ever leaving the vault.  However, it is not clear exactly how Anchorage intends to let clients have their cake and eat it too as specifics of the solution were not provided in the blog post.  When contacted by CoinDesk, a spokeswoman for Anchor Labs said that while cold storage relies on people, ""Anchorage is the only custodian to have solved digital asset custody by eliminating human points of failure,"" but did not elaborate. She also said Anchorage clients ""can move their assets within minutes of transaction approval.""  Bringing in whales  Explaining the origin of the idea, the Anchor Labs founders wrote that digital asset funds had come to them requesting assistance managing their private keys securely:  ""As we grew to understand the problem, we envisioned a solution based on the security principles we understood well: one that combines multi-person integrity with hardware-based systems, allowing us to build a platform that is more secure than cold storage, but has the benefits of keeping the assets accessible.""  Without providing much in the way of detail, Mónica and McCauley added that Anchorage ""applies the world’s most advanced and proven digital security architecture to better support institutional investments, while enabling active on-chain participation that offline cold storage historically hasn’t allowed.""  Bringing in institutions through new custody solutions can grow the blockchain space, both through an influx of funding and by forming the basis for ""a rich and mature financial ecosystem,"" they wrote.  ""The bull run of 2017 proved that crypto assets have tremendous potential value, and the backslide of 2018 showed us that the financial system surrounding those assets is far from maturity,"" the post noted, adding:  ""The global financial system is complex, and depends upon infrastructure whose crypto analogs haven’t yet been built. The digital economy needs that infrastructure to thrive.""

42402478,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJw3W,1548257453,"UK Financial Watchdog Plans Oversight of Security Tokens, Some Stablecoins","The U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has set out proposed guidance for how crypto assets should be regulated in the country.  In a consultation paper published Wednesday, the watchdog assigns the various crypto tokens into three categories and suggests whether these can be accommodated under existing rules overseen by the FCA – for example, as specified investments, financial instruments or e-money.  Explaining the reasons for guidelines, the agency said that crypto assets carry risks for consumers and investors, and clarification of what is regulated and what is not would help firms wishing to operate compliant businesses based around crypto assets.  In a statement, Christopher Woolard, the FCA’s executive director of strategy and competition, said:  “This is a small but growing market and we want both industry and consumers to be clear what is regulated, and what isn’t. This is vital if consumers are to know what protections they’ll benefit from and in ensuring we have a market functioning as it should.”  According to the draft paper, ""exchange tokens,"" such as bitcoin and litecoin, are not specified investments as they are currently not recognized as legal tender in the U.K. and are volatile compared to other investment avenues such as fiat currencies and commodities. Therefore, the buying and selling of these tokens do not fall under the FCA’s remit, the paper states.  On the other hand, ""security tokens"" are classed as specified investments, since their definition meets the one set out in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) Order. “These products are also capable of being financial instruments under MiFID II [Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II],” the FCA states.  While ""utility tokens"" may meet the criteria of e-money in certain circumstances, these would not generally be regulated by the FCA. “As utility tokens do not typically exhibit features that would make them the same as securities, they won’t be captured in the regulatory regime, unless they meet the definition of e-money,” the watchdog says.  Stablecoins, tokens pegged to a fiat currency like USD or GBPs, might meet the definition of e-money if ""backed by certain assets (which may include Specified Investments), a basket of cryptoassets, or potentially through algorithms that maintain the supply of the token.""  For security tokens, all the rules covering traditional securities will apply to them, too. Accordingly, firms wanting to deal in securities tokens would have to apply for permission from the FCA.  The FCA says: “A firm wanting to create infrastructure for the buying, selling and transferring of security tokens (commonly known as exchanges or trading platforms) must ensure it has the appropriate permissions for the activities it wants to carry out.”  The regulator is now seeking public comment on the guidance – which follows a 2018 pledge for further clarification on crypto assets from the UK Cryptoassets Taskforce – by April 5.  In an email to CoinDesk, Steve Davies, PwC’s blockchain lead, commented on the FCA paper, saying that, while it raises the potential risks associated with crypto assets, ""there are also a lot of positives.""  However, he continued:  “Some questions remain unanswered, including whether certain unregulated cryptoassets should be brought under the FCA’s jurisdiction to further protect consumers, and whether the existing regulatory framework is appropriate given the unique features and risks associated with these products.""

42402476,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJw2X,1548255632,Nasdaq Leads $20 Million Funding Round for Blockchain Startup Symbiont,"Enterprise blockchain startup Symbiont has closed a $20 million Series-B funding round led by Nasdaq Ventures with participation from Galaxy Digital, Citi, Raptor Group and others.  The firm, which has kept a fairly low profile the last two years as the cryptocurrency market's gyrations overshadowed the enterprise sector, previously raised a combined $15.4 million from a seed round in 2014 and Series A in 2017.  Symbiont CEO Mark Smith told CoinDesk that the firm doubled its staff last year, and now has more than 60 employees.  “We have been very good stewards of capital for the six years we have been in business. I think we have done more with less than anybody out there,"" Smith said. ""So it was time for us to do a bigger round and adding the Nasdaq as an investor and partner, and Citi as an investor and partner, really solidifies our strategy.”  As part of the investment, Nasdaq Financial Framework, a software company owned by the exchange, will integrate Symbiont’s Assembly smart contracts platform to explore new avenues involving tokenization.  Smith, a veteran of the early days of financial market matching engines, explained there has been a big movement towards combining blockchain with traditional exchange technology.  “Symbiont will give Nasdaq the ability to originate a financial instrument and the smart contract to custody it on a blockchain, to allow trading to occur with their matching engine, to allow surveillance to occur across the network using Nasdaq technology and then to perform settlement on a blockchain,” he said.  To be clear, Symbiont is not working with the Nasdaq proper, just the software arm, which sells tech to other exchanges, clearing houses and central securities depositories in about 50 countries.  As Smith put it:  “We are infrastructure people: dirt under the fingernails, digging the ditches, laying the roads.”  Win some, lose some  Indeed, Symbiont has kept a firm focus on building capital markets infrastructure using a proprietary blockchain and smart contracts architecture.  The startup has lasered in on a handful of carefully selected use cases and partners, such as index data management with investment giant Vanguard; making the mortgage market transparent and more efficient with Wall Street legend Lewis Ranieri; and optimizing the syndicated loans market with Ipreo’s Synaps platform.  However, not all its partnerships panned out. For instance, Symbiont dedicated a lot of time and effort between 2015 and 2017 helping create a blockchain technology-enabled regulatory environment in the state of Delaware, creating rules for share registry and the ability to create a whole new class of securities.  All that work, done free of charge, came to naught for Symbiont when Governor Jack Markell’s term ended, according to Smith.  “The new administration came in with less fanfare about the use of the technology and a very conservative approach,"" he said. ""Instead of moving forward, they took a big step back and decided to defend the incumbents against what they considered disruptive tech, then reached out to IBM and spent over $1 million replicating the exact road map we gave the state."" (The precise amount of the single-bid contract was $738,000, according to the Delaware News Journal.)  Another wrench was thrown into the works last August, when Symbiont's partner on syndicated loans, Ipreo, was acquired by IHS Markit, which has worked with ethereum-based Quorum (developed by JPMorgan) on this use case.  Smith could not say too much about this but hinted that Symbiont's new big-bank investor would go to bat for it on the syndicated loan front. “Certainly with Citi now in our cap table we can see how this is going to move forward,” he said. (Citi was the world's third-largest underwriter of syndicated loans last year, running $271 billion of transactions, according to Thomson Reuters data.)  Competitive landscape  It’s common these days to view the enterprise blockchain world as consisting of Hyperedger, R3, Digital Asset and enterprise ethereum variants. Symbiont has been around for as long as any of these forks, consortiums or other proprietary solutions, and Smith is never shy about sharing his opinion of them.  “I would argue that we are the only enterprise blockchain solution,"" he said. The others, he contended, either aren't really blockchains or have privacy and security shortcomings or haven't produced anything beyond ideas.  On the subject of corralling together large consortiums, Smith believes innovation always comes from individuals and small teams that are able to iterate quickly and nimbly.  “I think what you get in consortiums is just compromise. You end up with average tech, nothing revolutionary – sometimes barely evolutionary. Creating a back office as a service with a shared ledger is not revolutionary. That's what a consortium will get you,” Smith said.  So what does Symbiont have to show for its work? Smith said several of its projects will enter production in 2019, starting with the Vanguard collaboration, which uses corporate action data to manage the asset manager’s passive indices. Syndicated loans and mortgages will follow.  As far as the sustained bear market for crypto assets is concerned, Smith said from day one his firm had stayed away from those sorts of “shenanigans.""  “We kept our head down and focused on what we always believed would be the marketplace, which is a regulated marketplace,” he said.  Of course, he is very sad to hear of people losing their jobs and said it was unfortunate that many people lost a lot of money. But overall, Smith said he is glad to be out of the hype cycle, concluding,  “We are in the trough of disillusionment and I am extremely excited.”  Mark Smith image via CoinDesk Consensus archives",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/01/23/nasdaq-leads-20-million-funding-round-for-blockchain-startup-symbiont,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3921c368978afe10271375ec51f02911e7067c06-1500x1144.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Institute for Fintech Research (THUIFR) at Tsinghua University in Beijing announced last week that the scholarship program would focus on global regulatory policies and blockchain development. Selected students will also get to participate in corporate visits and events.  Ivy Gao, director of international cooperation and development at the university, said that the initiative is aimed to provide students a “comprehensive view” of global blockchain regulatory policies, adding that he believes it would help students with their “future research or career in the field of blockchain technology.""  Eric van Miltenburg, Ripple’s SVP of global operations, said:  “The program’s goal – to provide students with opportunities in blockchain research – closely aligns with that of Ripple’s University Blockchain Research Initiative; we’re thrilled to support THUIFR in this endeavor and look forward to its launch.”  Back in June, Ripple announced it was putting over $50 million into academic research into blockchain through the university initiative. It partnered with 17 universities from across the globe at the time, including institutions in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Canada, Europe, India and South Korea.  Blockchain research projects from educational institutions around the world have received funding support from government agencies as well. Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Energy announced federal funding of up to $4.8 million for universities working on R&D projects, including those related to blockchain.

42402469,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJvwd,1548244812,Seed CX Launches Spot Bitcoin Trading in Bid for Big-Money Investors,"Seed CX has taken its first big step to bring institutional investors to the crypto space.  The Chicago-based exchange startup announced Wednesday that it had launched a bitcoin spot trading market for its major clients, offering a regulated platform with ""a deep book of liquidity."" Interested clients can access the market through a web API, a graphical user interface or the financial information exchange (FIX) protocol, according to a press release.  Seed CX, which has raised $25 million since its inception in 2015, is now offering a licensed exchange for institutional trading and settlement. At some point in the near future, it will begin offering a market for crypto derivatives regulated by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  ""We're offering truly institutional level support. We are live,"" said Seed CX co-founder and CEO Edward Woodford.  He told CoinDesk that at launch, the exchange will offer a bitcoin/U.S. dollar trading pair, with plans to add dollar pairs for ether, litecoin and bitcoin cash by the end of the month.  ""In February we're going to be offering more trading pairs, so we're going to be offering up euros and Japanese yen,"" he added.  Woodford explained that Seed CX's offering targets institutions looking at the market after months of price declines, adding:  ""The narrative right now is 'low prices, low prices, low prices,' and the question is how do we respond to this. In a sense, we've launched months ago [by on-boarding early clients], but now we're getting a whole bunch of clients looking to decrease their operational risk.""  Managing risk  As part of these efforts to decrease risk, the exchange plans to help investors with margin trading, use larger tick (minimum price movement) and contract sizes than retail trading platforms and employ tighter quote requirements for its clients.  Clients can also post non-traditional assets (including digital assets) as collateral.  All U.S. dollar deposits to the exchange will be stored in regulated banks and insured through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), while digital assets will be stored via Seed CX's wallet infrastructure. Rather than storing all its clients' crypto in one big pot, as many crypto exchanges do, Seed CX maintains segregated wallets for each client.  As part of its pitch to potential clients, the exchange also noted that it does not trade against customers (and it forbids employees from trading crypto). Its subsidiary, Zero Hash, is a Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)-registered money service business (MSB) and licensed money transmitter in nearly 30 U.S. states.  While the ongoing crypto bear market has resulted in multiple firms tightening their belts and otherwise cutting back, Woodford said both the number of clients and their composition signing up with Seed CX has increased in the past several months.  Whereas before, interest came from crypto startups, he said that there is ""now greater external money.""  ""It's groups that aren't just based in the crypto space. The price normalization hasn't stopped legitimate large groups [from entering],"" he added.

42402484,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJw9Q,1548241221,Gold Price May Offer Clues About Next Big Bitcoin Move,"Bitcoin (BTC) traders could get cues from an apparent negative correlation that has developed between bitcoin and gold prices.  Gold picked up a strong bid at $1,196 on Nov. 13 and jumped to $1,300 on Jan. 4, possibly due to a sell-off in the weakening U.S. dollar. The greenback was down against most currencies in last two months of 2018 on growing speculation that the Federal Reserve (Fed) could decrease or pause interest rate hikes in 2019.  Bitcoin, however, did not benefit from that broad-based sell-off in the dollar. The cryptocurrency instead saw a revived bear market with a convincing move below $6,000 on Nov. 14 – a day after gold found takers around $1,200 per ounce.  That price action indicates that the two assets are inversely correlated. Validating that argument is the 90-day correlation coefficient of -0.593. The statistical measure ranges from -1 to 1, with a negative number representing the inverse relationship between the two variables, while a positive number implies direct correlation.  As a result, the leading cryptocurrency by market value could be influenced by the next move in gold prices. Currently, the safe haven metal is trading at $1,285, having hit a three-week low of $1,276 earlier this week.  Meanwhile, BTC is trading in a narrow range above $3,500 for the 13th straight day. The prolonged period of consolidation could end with a strong bullish move if the corrective pullback in gold worsens.  It is worth noting that correlation is not causation and only describes the relative change in one variable when there is a change in another.  Bitcoin and gold chart        As seen above, bitcoin and gold have moved in opposite directions since late November.  Gold rallied 8.33 percent in seven weeks leading up to Jan. 4. During the same time, BTC depreciated by 50 percent.  Further, gold's repeated failure at $1,300 has established that psychological level as a stiff near-term resistance. Meanwhile, BTC has defended $3,500 since Jan. 11.  The cryptocurrency could see a strong bullish move if the pullback in the yellow metal gathers steam.  Bitcoin daily chart  On the daily chart, BTC created a ""long-tailed"" candle at the crucial support of $3,500, signaling bearish exhaustion. A positive follow-through – that is, a convincing move above $3,615 (Tuesday’s low) – would confirm bullish bias.  View  Bitcoin and gold look to be inversely correlated and sustained weakness in gold could bode well for BTC going forward.  As far as technicals are concerned, the immediate bias remains bearish, as indicated by the downward sloping 10-week MA. The prospects of a break higher toward $4,000 would improve if prices close today (as per UTC) above $3,615.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

The DoBS published the new guidance for the local crypto industry on Wednesday, following a number of enquiries from businesses, it said.  The department explained that as bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not ""money,"" the Money Transmission Business Licensing Law or the Money Transmitter Act of Pennsylvania does not apply to crypto trading platforms.  According to the act, only fiat currency or the U.S. government-issued currency is considered money. “To date, no jurisdiction in the United States has designated virtual currency as legal tender,” the department said.  The act states that parties conducting the business of transmitting money need to be licensed if they transfer fiat currency and must charge a fee for the transfer. However, as crypto exchanges “never directly handle” fiat currency and the transactions are conducted through a bank account, these ""are not money transmitters” that require the license, according to the guidance.  Other businesses in the sector, such as cryptocurrency kiosk, ATM and vending machine providers are also not money transmitters.  The DoBS said:  “In both the one-way and two-way Kiosk systems, there is no transfer of money to any third party. The user of the Kiosk merely exchanges fiat currency for virtual currency and vice versa, and there is no money transmission.”  Pennsylvania's clarification on the license arrives after a three-year delay. Back in January 2016, the government was seeking to update the state’s definition of money to cover cryptocurrency businesses, but the initiative stalled at the time due to a budget impasse.  The scenario may be different for firms dealing with initial coin offering (ICO) tokens at the federal level, however. In March 2018, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) said: “An exchange that sells ICO coins or tokens, or exchanges them for other virtual currency, fiat currency, or other value that substitutes for currency, would typically also be a money transmitter.”  Pennsylvania State Capitol image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Yogita Khatri,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/01/23/pennsylvania-clarifies-that-crypto-exchanges-are-not-money-transmitters,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4900daa4d993034429df6b34db5df25308ae07e7-1500x949.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Although the network is still under development, Bitfury announced a comprehensive product list to support the tech on Wednesday, including an open-source lightning wallet and hardware and software tools for merchants and payment processors to accept payments. It also released developer tools and a public lightning network node called ""The Peach"" to let bitcoin users open or create payment channels.  The product bundle is designed to make using the lightning network ""easier for vendors and consumers to use,"" Bitfury said.  A layer-2 payments technology that debuted on bitcoin early last year, lightning enables transactions with near-instantaneous confirmation speeds without having to store information directly on the blockchain.  The new tools were built by Bitfury’s Lightning Peach team – the internal group focused on lightning development.  ""By providing these products to the market, Bitfury is encouraging worldwide adoption of this technology and providing unparalleled support to consumers and merchants,"" said Valery Vavilov, CEO of Bitfury.  The company announced last Tuesday that it had integrated lightning technology for use on cryptocurrency exchange BTCBIT.  Saying that users of the exchange could now ""benefit from faster, lower-cost payments,"" a Medium article also specified that the integration would ""help more people use bitcoin in their everyday lives in a faster and more convenient way.""  Marketed as a ""full-service blockchain technology company"" on its official website, Bitfury closed an $80 million funding round led by venture capital firm Korelya Capital last November.  While the company is best known for manufacturing specialized cryptocurrency mining hardware, such as the ""Clarke"" ASIC chip, Bitfury is now looking to spur global adoption of blockchain technology as part of its corporate agenda.  Bitfury Group previously announced a partnership with blockchain-based payment processing system Paytomat last year, linking Paytomat’s digital wallet and merchant app to the lightning network.  Earlier that same year, the company launched a blockchain toolkit dubbed Crystal for users to identify and investigate criminal activity on the bitcoin blockchain.

Blockchain Industries, an investment firm focusing on the crypto and blockchain industry and traded on the U.S over-the-counter markets, announced Tuesday that it had signed a binding letter of intent agreement with Singapore-based BTHMB Holdings, the holding company of Bithumb, for the reverse merger deal.  A reverse merger is also known as a reverse initial public offering (IPO), wherein a private company acquires a publicly listed company to bypass the lengthy and complex process of a conventional IPO.  Once the deal goes through, the combined entity would be known as Blockchain Exchange Alliance (BXA), potentially becoming the first U.S.-listed crypto exchange. Both parties aim to complete the deal by March 1, according to the announcement.  BTHMB Holdings has already agreed to put $1 million into an escrow account as a consideration for the deal, which is still subject to due diligence review by the parties involved, as well as a final agreement on terms and valuation.  Patrick Moynihan, CEO of Blockchain Industries, said that the deal is expected to bring “liquidity, accessibility and expansion” to the blockchain sector, adding:  ""By merging with BTHMB/BXA, we expect to bring more advanced technology and better compliance practices into the public marketplace via a consolidated focus.""  Through the deal, BTHMB Holdings plans to expand its business operations in North America, the statement states.  The news comes months after Bithumb sold over 38 percent of its ownership to a consortium based in Singapore, owned by plastic surgeon Byung Gun Kim, for about $350 million.  Kim, in Tuesday's statement, said: ""By unifying our businesses, we benefit from the focused expertise of Blockchain Industries. As a result, ... we expect quality results from this merger.""  In June 2018, Bithumb was hacked for nearly $31 million in cryptocurrency. Later the same month, the exchange claimed that it had reduced the losses to $17 million after retrieving some of the funds.
