42377026,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6wK8b,1395267877,$500k Villa Sold in What May be Biggest Bitcoin Purchase on Record,"Online bitcoin-only luxury marketplace BitPremier has completed the sale of a fully managed villa at the deLMango Villa Estate in Bali, Indonesia, in what may be the largest reported bitcoin transaction to date.  Founder and CEO Alan Silbert indicates that the 3,000-square-foot villa sold for more than $500,000, though the exact price paid by the buyer was not revealed.  Silbert, brother of SecondMarket CEO and BitPremier investor Barry Silbert, indicated that the sale is ""by far the largest"" completed to date via the marketplace, which was launched last May.  Further, he sees the purchase as proof that bitcoin buyers will be increasingly willing to diversify their assets with other investment opportunities.  Explained Silbert:  ""This definitely validates the business model. It shows that bitcoin users want to buy things that are unique, and that are above and beyond t-shirts and electronics.""  The sale was finalized in late February.  More details  Speaking to CoinDesk, Silbert did not reveal many more details about the buyer, mentioning only that the individual was an early bitcoin adopter based in the US.  Said Silbert: ""He's been in the bitcoin community for at least a couple years.""  As for the house sale, Silbert indicated that due to Indonesia's unique laws regarding the ownership of real estate by foreigners, the buyer is technically purchasing a long-term lease.  The property boasts an intricate design that blends the indoors and outdoors with open-sided rooms, a dedicated dining pavilion and a private pool.  In addition, the villa features two modern bedrooms and two bathrooms.  The buyer will earn income based on the performance of the rental unit and villa as a whole, Silbert said.  Bitcoin's biggest transactions  The $500,000 sale price would trump the $103,000 paid for a Tesla Model S in December, believed to be the largest single consumer purchase conducted in bitcoin.  However, it falls well short of the $147m mystery transaction, later revealed to be the product of a Bitstamp audit, that is the largest single transaction ever.  About BitPremier  An online marketplace that connects bitcoin buyers and sellers, BitPremier has hosted a range of exotic items on its forum, including most recently a pair of Wooly Mammoth tusks that were put up for sale for the asking price of $175,000.  BitPremier facilitates communication between both parties, who remain anonymous until the terms of the deal are settled. Funds are then held in escrow until the buyer confirms an item has been delivered. BitPremier then sends funds to the seller, with a 5% fee deducted from the proceeds.  The website is currently listing other notable items such as a 16-inch pearl necklace valued at $10,000; a Paris property with a view of the Eiffel Tower listed for €4.6m; and a 1969 Boss 429 Mustang being offered for $290,000.

42377009,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6wJlx,1395265135,Bankrupt Bitcoin Mining Company Alydian to Sell 218TH/s of Mining Power,"Enterprise-scale bitcoin mining company Alydian, the CoinLab-backed company that filed for bankruptcy in November, has revealed that it will sell its bitcoin mining systems in the runup to its eventual shutdown.  The Seattle-based company has since settled with all of its creditors, and the sale marks the end for what was CoinLab's first startup launched in August of last year.  Alydian director of engineering, Robert Batten, indicated that the company is now accepting bids for three mining systems with a combined 218TH/s output, for $5,000/TH to interested buyers.  Batten said that though the systems may not be new models, they still represent a great investment opportunity for the right buyer or buyers looking seriously for a quick way into the bitcoin mining business.  Explained Batten:  ""[The equipment is] a small step behind the current state-of-the-art [systems], but it will still make money in its lifetime. It's not obsolete to the point where there's no value.""  What's for sale  The company offered a number of details about the available equipment. For example, the mining systems are configured as 1TH/s rackmount systems in 19-inch racks, and each system uses roughly 6kW of power. The systems were custom-built by Alydian engineers.  The systems are currently installed in three different data centers in the Pacific Northwest, according to Batten, and are ready to go for buyers. Alydian was headquartered in Seattle, but had its engineering offices in Portland, Oregon.  Said Batten:  ""[Buyers] wouldn't need to pick up the components or do anything like that. They'd essentially just have to point the miners at their specific bitcoin back-end services.""  The systems have contracts with two hosting companies. The rigs are being sold as is and on location.  Making an offer  Alydian indicated that all offers are subject to review and approval by the company, though Batten could not comment as to the eventual use of the funds. The minimum sale price of $5,000/TH includes the extra equipment and parts.  The final purchase price can be paid in bitcoins or USD. Offers for the company's mining systems should be submitted to Batten from 19th March through 5pm PDT on 25th March. Interested buyers can contact Batten via robert@coinlab.com.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/19/bankrupt-bitcoin-mining-company-alydian-to-sell-218ths-of-mining-power,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fa03b3fcf4c83eddca6f1ed035b55d803261a5bb-1082x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377014,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6wJsF,1395259835,"Blockchain Restores Services After Outage, Promises 'Post-Mortem' Review","More than a day after bitcoin wallet provider Blockchain.info first indicated it was experiencing a severe outage, its services have been fully restored, a company blog post has revealed.  Issues began with Blockchain noting that it had suspended SharedCoin transactions in what was initially suspected to be a short delay. However, that announcement, made on 17th March, proceeded a long period of downtime that extended into the late evening the next day.  Blockchain updated users that all Blockchain services were operational again as of 10pm PST, 18th March.    As of 10pm PT, 5am UTC Blockchain services are RESTORED http://t.co/IssrKmpKRI Thank you for your patience and support      — Blockchain.info (@blockchain) March 19, 2014    The company had originally indicated that the problems stemmed from an 'unusual database issue', though the problem was later revealed to be the result of an error that affected several tables meant to track information contained in the bitcoin blockchain ledger.  Blockchain stated that though the problem was easy to identify, fixing the issue proved challenging due to the size of the affected data sets.  Explained Blockchain's security and distributed systems expert Andreas Antonopoulos:  ""We decided to pursue multiple methods to try to fix the problem, including re-compiling a custom version of MySQL to get around the error, while simultaneously restoring databases from our backup systems onto new servers. Because of the large dataset, each step in testing, restoring or copying data can take a very long time, making the entire process slow.""  Blockchain has promised a forthcoming 'post-mortem' report on the issue that will elaborate further on the facts within the next few days.  Continued issues  In his written comments, Antonopoulos expressed his thanks to the company's consumer and business users for their patience while it worked to correct the issue.  ""We understand how frustrating it can be to be unable to access funds and we would like to take every precaution necessary to ensure this does not recur. Our team has worked non-stop to ensure services are returned to you in a timely manner.""  At press time, however, Blockchain had issued another blog post detailing additional problems being experienced by some users, though they were unrelated to the larger outage.  Blockchain indicated that the company is currently working to address an issue being experienced by existing iPhone users, and that SharedCoin would continue to remain offline.  It reassured iPhone users that all funds are currently accounted for despite the glitch.  Blockchain's response  In contrast to measures taken by other high-profile companies during outages, the Blockchain team was unusually communicative about issues, releasing five blog posts between the initial message and the final declaration that services would be restored.  In between, the company stressed to users that it was dedicating its efforts to restoring services, and reiterated to users that no funds were affected by the error.  The blockchain team was active updating users on reddit - posting multiple, live edits to messages, and in responding to frustrated users on Twitter in what amounted to an agressive PR campaign to educate and assure users.    @nawazkiani That is categorically false. No funds or accounts have been compromised. We don’t have access to your keys.      — Blockchain.info (@blockchain) March 19, 2014    Community reaction  Blockchain's response to the ordeal was greeted positively by the digital currency community, with many lauding the willingness of the team to remain open about problems and progress.    @aantonop@blockchain Keep up the great work! A+ for giving users a way to access their funds while going through the outage!      — CryptoBucket (@CryptoBucket) March 19, 2014    Mt. Gox was roundly criticized for its silence in the wake of massive theft and its eventual insolvency. Further, what statements it did issue did little to stem frustration and caused huge sell offs among investors.  Though Blockchain's efforts seem to have avoided such mistakes, some remained unsatisfied with the efforts.    @aantonop @blockchain 72 hours of downtime should result in a policy review and someone fired instead of tweets honestly. But, bitcoin.      — Cuke King (@cukeking) March 19, 2014    Next steps  Speaking to CoinDesk, CEO Nicolas Cary indicated that Blockchain would embark on a large-scale review of the service issues.  Cary indicated that the company would continue its policy of remaining open with users and any and all concerns.  ""We've just started our post-mortem research and it will be a few days before we have comprehensive documentation of the incident. [...] We will be publishing the entire account on our blog so the whole Bitcoin community can learn from this.""  Antonopoulos also expressed his frustration at the outage, vowing that more work would be done to restore user confidence in the coming days and weeks.  ""We take pride in our work and care deeply about our customers, so this outage was humbling and painful for us too. We will do everything we can to regain your trust and make sure this doesn’t happen again.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | RESEARCH,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/19/blockchain-restores-services-after-outage-promises-post-mortem-review,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2b4bdd116f954ab380e4ba63d30a3f5b6a6fdc13-1000x709.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42377028,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6wK9r,1395245070,"Banks, Corruption and Crypto: Can Bitcoin Change India?","Last December, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued a warning on digital currencies noting that the bank had not yet authorized any organisation in India to use cryptocurrencies as a method of payment.  As a result, several bitcoin exchanges in India suspended operations, and at least two were raided by government officials, including Buysellbitcoin.in.  Yet, just days later, a deputy governor of the RBI seemed reluctant to concede that it was the bank's job to regulate digital currencies. Soon after, one exchange, Unocoin, was back in operation.  Additionally, around this time, Bitcoin Alliance India publicly asked the government to offer clear guidance on virtual currencies, which it has yet to do.  So with all these ups and downs, what's really going on with bitcoin in India?  Corruption solution?  The reluctance of the Indian government to make decisions about virtual currencies may be merely because it doesn't want to stifle innovation.  Or it could be because trustless systems could quite possibly eradicate corruption in the country? This is certainly one reason why there are many efforts to spread the word about bitcoin in India, including several meetup groups in Bangalore.  Amith Nirgunarthy, an American living in India, has started an blog called iHaveBitcoinshttp://www.ihavebitcoins.com/. His goal is to increase public awareness of the currency and educate new users.  Nirgunarthy believes that bitcoin could be used to reduce wrongdoing within the Indian government, saying:  “If every single government subsidy program was given to the bitcoin protocol, there would be no corruption anymore.”  Nirgunarthy is referring to the amount of waste he believes exists within the government's programs for doling out food, electricity and fuel to the people.  If a system of accountability like the blockchain's public ledger, or electronically signed 'smart contracts', were used in the country, these problems could be vastly reduced.  The recent story about the plight of the country's Winter Olympics athletes is just one example of the corruption that still exists in India.  The athletes had planned to enter as independent competitors because the International Olympic Committee had suspended the Indian Olympic Association in 2012 due to corruption.  In an interesting twist, dogecoin supporters donated some of that cryptocurrency to the Olympic hopefuls to make up for a lack of funding. However, the team's suspension was rescinded immediately before the games commenced.  It was a turn of events that reflects the rollercoaster ride that cryptocurrencies are currently on in India.  Banking and microfinance  While a number of state-owned big banks dominate in India, there are several sizeable private institutions, including ICICI and Citibank. However, India has not given out a new banking licence in over nine years – although the government says new ones will be issued soon.  In 2013, India's national currency, the rupee, was weakened when it sharply lost its value against the dollar. Other emerging markets have shared this particular problem of late, although, in the case of Argentina in particular, it was in part due to currency controls put in place by the government.  Currency fluctuations, coupled with the number of unbanked people in India, create an environment ripe for financial disruption. In 2008, a study found that only 48% of adults in India were utilizing any sort of financial services.  One of the reasons so many people remain without banking in India is that there is little incentive for financial innovation. It is very difficult to obtain bank licensing, and the cost of starting any kind of new finance-related enterprise can be daunting.  ""Bitcoin has the potential to collapse the cost structure of financial services in India,"" says Atish Babu, the principal of Omnivore Capital, which invests in early stage Indian agriculture startups. Babu is also helping to mentor US bitcoin startups that have been placed in accelerator programs.  Proof that the traditional finance sector in India can be successfully bypassed is seen in the rise of microfinance. The growth of microlending as a popular option for the unbanked led the Indian government to issue specific guidance in 2011 and a licensing program.  Babu believes that bitcoin could be bigger than microfinance, saying:  ""The impact of bitcoin could potentially dwarf what India has seen through the microfinance revolution.""  Playing by the rules  In February, a business called HighKart became the first online retailer in India to accept only bitcoin as payment. Its owner believes that the value of bitcoin will rise in the future and decided to bypass rupees as an option for his site.  And Unocoin, the Indian bitcoin exchange, is still in business.  Vikram Nikkam is Unocoin's Head of Business Development. He says that the exchange is still in operation because it is playing by the rules as best it can:  ""All transactions are through the banking system to keep all aspects of the transaction within the current legal framework.""  Unocoin users must be verified with personal information and an ID card scan.  Considering recent events, the exchange actually has a good relationship with several banks, and its users are even able to use NEFT (national electronic fund transfer) – similar to the US's ACH (automated clearing house) system – to transfer money to the exchange.  Unocoin's web interface is reminiscent of Coinbase's, but the US-based wallet provider has only one banking partner to work with, not three.  The fact that Unocoin works with multiple banks means that it could withstand the loss of one of them at any time and continue operating normally. Furthermore, the exchange says it can convert fiat to bitcoin in an impressive two hours when customers use NEFT.  Pressing the issue  Unocoin's Nikkam helps coordinate various events aimed to spread the word about the cryptocurrency in India. The concept of the block chain – thought of by many in India as a way to reduce corruption through transparency – is a major theme at these gatherings.  Said Nikkam:  ""In our meetups we make all efforts to help technologists understand the potential of a globally distributed asset ledger and how various highly efficient layers of applications can be built on this protocol.""  Since the bitcoin exchange raid drama at the end of 2013, there has been increased pressure for the RBI, India's central bank, to look into virtual currencies. Government representatives say that the country's Finance Minister is considering the issue.  And surely, the government must be paying attention – there is a widespread populist movement in India to rid the of country chronic corruption problems. Well-attended demonstrations have become common in the capital, Delhi, alongside high-profile hunger strikes aimed to highlight the issue of graft.  The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) is the government body tasked with giving every person in India an identification number. Once complete, it is hoped the system will provide improved accountability and reduced government waste.  However, it is questionable whether the UIDAI system will reduce corruption in any significant way.  However, new decentralized systems powered by cryptography could influence financial innovation and improve methods of account in India, whether the government likes it or not.  Said Omnivore's Atish Babu:  ""India is in a prime position to leapfrog financial service technologies that have been used in more developed economies for decades, much like we did by skipping over landline in favour of mobile phones.""  Could this country's enormous population just disregard the banks and take up a novel financial system like bitcoin? If so, it could result in the reforms needed to reduce government malfeasance.

42377016,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6wJul,1395240352,"Bitcoin Version 0.9.0 Brings Transaction Malleability Fixes, Branding Change","Update 20th March 6 pm GMT: Updated with commentary from core developer Mike Hearn.  Update 20th March 6:30 pm GMT: Updated with commentary from BitMonet founder and developer Ankur Nandwani.  Update 21st March 6:30 pm GMT: Updated with commentary from bitcoin developer Peter Todd.  Bitcoin's core developers have released the latest update to the bitcoin reference client, version 0.9.0, which includes transaction malleability-related fixes, as well as updates to how transactions are relayed on the network.  Version 0.9.0https://bitcoin.org/bin/0.9.0/README.txt  notably includes coin control features and a Windows 64-bit installer, among other updates, bug fixes and minor feature additions.  Bitcoin core developer Gavin Andresen took to Twitter to publicize the news.    Bitcoin Core version 0.9.0 is finished! Download binaries from https://t.co/Brm6CPBw58 -- report bugs to https://t.co/hz1q6u2AGC      — Gavin Andresen (@gavinandresen) March 19, 2014    In addition to the technical fixes, however, the update also comes with a branding change. The developers announced they are renaming the bitcoin reference client Bitcoin Core to reduce confusion between the network and the software.  Transaction malleability  The most noteworthy changes were those aimed at transaction malleability issues. These problems gained notoriety for the key role they played in helping hackers launch large-scale attacks against most major bitcoin exchanges in February, and for being named as a scapegoat for problems experienced by now-bankrupt exchange Mt. Gox.  Transaction malleability updates include tweaks that prevent the relaying and mining of mutated transactions, and fixes to RPC commands meant to report incorrect balances for double-spent or mutated transactions.  Core developer Mike Hearn said that despite the upgrades, however, transaction malleability remains a work in progress.  ""It's not finished by any means. Finishing transaction malleability, or as far as we know how, is going to take more upgrades.""  Default fees  Version 0.9.0 drops the default fee for relaying transactions across the entire network, though it still does not guarantee transactions will be accepted by miners.  Hearn indicated that the bitcoin network had previously imposed a hard-coded cost in BTC for relaying transactions, but that this figure did not change with the exchange rate. As a result, when the price increased or decreased, the cost of these payments did not adjust accordingly.  Explained Hearn: ""Work is being done to make these [fees] float. Gavin [Andresen] wanted to get this done with 0.9.0 but it didn't quite make it.""  Ankur Nandwani, founder of BitMonet, indicated that this update was perhaps the most noteworthy, though he expressed that there could be drawbacks to the changes.  ""I think reduction in transaction fees will bolster the use of bitcoin as a means of facilitating microtransactions. But at the same time, it would be interesting to see if the blockchain gets bloated with microtransactions because of this change.""  Developer Peter Todd seemed most critical of this aspect of the release, suggesting that the change in how fees are handled opens up the bitcoin core to DDoS attack.  ""Bitcoin Core, even the new release, never removes a transaction from memory unless it gets mined into a block, so if an attacker just floods the network with really cheap transactions they can use up a lot of RAM and network bandwidth for very little money, causing nodes to crash with out-of-memory errors, as well as screwing up block propagation.""  His comments suggest that the bitcoin core may be evolving in a way that is not suitable for large volumes of microtransactions, to date one of the strongest value propositions for bitcoin, or that at the very least how to do so while maintaining the decentralized nature of bitcoin is unclear.  Payment protocol  Core developer Mike Hearn suggested version 0.9.0's addition of the payment protocol was the biggest takeaway. The technology allows for the creation of files that contain bitcoin addresses, but also more information that will help the bitcoin user experience grow with user expectations.  Explained Hearn:  ""The bitcoin address had no way to add features to that like refunds, security, privacy upgrades, recurring billing, all these great features that people have been talking about for a long time.""  Other key updates  Among the other important changes was the update for Windows, which was made after frequent reports that users would run out of memory in 32-bit systems. Furthermore, an update has been made to the behaviour of 'walletpassphrase', which previously failed when already unlocked.  Core developer Tamas Blummer, who is also the CEO of bitcoin technology company Bits of Proof, indicated one of his favourite updates were to ""OP_RETURN relay"", which standardizes how to commit short data to the block chain, and ""reject message"", which gives feedback on transactions created by organisations that use a reference client.  Reaction  The community reacted on both reddit and Bitcoin Talk forum, with bitcoin users lauding the quality of the development team and the breadth of the changes.  Still, though there are improvements, not everyone in the community believes the update goes far enough. Bitcoin Core remains, after all, a work in progress.  Said Blummer:  ""I am disappointed to see no significant refactoring of the client toward a more modular architecture. It is foreseeable that the reference implementation will evolve to the router of the network while wallet functionality will be taken over by specialized software just like it happened with mining.""  Others suggested they would take a wait-and-see approach to the upgrade, waiting to download until bugs had been addressed.  Hearn, however, encourages all members of the bitcoin community not to wait to upgrade, stressing that key changes in this update could be very beneficial for the bitcoin ecosystem.    ""It's important that people upgrade, because if we don't, we won't be able to lower the [transaction relay] fees, and obviously the higher the fee is, the less attractive bitcoin is.""            Updating to version 0.9.0  The official release advises those running older versions of the protocol to proceed through the following steps:  Shut down the older version  Uninstall all earlier versions  Run the installer (Windows) or copy the application (Mac and Linux).  Those running versions 0.7.2 or earlier will need to have their blockchain files re-indexed, a process which the development team suggests will take between 30 minutes and several hours.

42377020,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6wJxH,1395236035,Danish Central Bank Compares Bitcoins to 'Glass Beads',"Danmarks Nationalbank, the Danish central bank, has issued a stern warning on bitcoin, saying that it is not money in the true sense of the word, as it is not backed by an issuing institution.  Rather than functioning like money, bitcoins display the characteristics of commodities – that is, users attach value to them, not issuers or central banks.  Yet, said the bank, bitcoins do not have intrinsic value like gold and silver, and they bear a closer resemblance to ""glass beads"" – an apparent reference to the beads that were traded in past centuries for gold, ivory and other commodities.  No value anchor  ""Bitcoin is a virtual currency without any value anchor and hence it may rise sharply or fall very suddenly. A core property of money is that its value is stable so that its purchasing power does not change markedly from day to day,"" said the bank's Governor Hugo Frey Jensen. He added:  ""In spite of the considerable focus, use of bitcoins as a means of payment remains very limited. Against that background, the risks linked to their use are currently assessed to be limited to the individual user.""  He added that European authorities are analysing the need to regulate such virtual currencies. In December 2013, the European Banking Authority (EBA) issued a warning on the potential risks related to virtual currencies, focusing on fraud and theft.  The bank warns that bitcoin is subject to wild fluctuations and recent events such as cyber attacks launched against bitcoin exchanges illustrate the risks associated with digital currencies. Since bitcoins are not protected by depositor guarantees or consumer protection legislation, investors face high levels of risk.  Reluctant to regulate  Last year, Denmark's Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) clearly stated that the use of digital currency in the country is not regulated. The FSA said it would not police digital currencies, as they are not covered by existing regulation.  Most countries in Europe have adopted a similar stance. They do not view digital currencies as money, hence regulators do not think it is within their purview to deal with them.  The FSA also outlined a number of concerns and risks associated with bitcoin and other digital currencies. These ranged from tax implications to the risk of losing money invested in digital currencies through theft or volatility.

Under the bonnet, the Titan will have blades containing numerous cards, differentiating it from the Jupiter. There is still no word on what sort of silicon KnC is using for the new miner.  Early orders  The Titan is expected to ship in the second or third quarter of the year, but KnC is already accepting pre-orders. The company stated:  ""The same team and partners have been working together again. With their expertise and speed, we expect to ship Titan before the competition and have a product that outperforms their offerings.""  KnC points out that it reserves the right to increase the performance at any time and, since this is an untested design that will ship in a few months, customers are advised to read the terms and conditions carefully.  In keeping with the nature of the Titan's abilities, the company says it will add litecoin as a payment method in the near future, but for the time being it will accept bitcoin and traditional money transfers only.  It also appears that customers who have placed an order for Neptune bitcoin miners can convert their order to a Titan if required. Those with orders already placed should get in touch with customer services to confirm the details of the switch.  Neptune on track  In related mining news, KnC's Neptune miner appears to be on track – the new bitcoin ASIC taped out earlier this month with everything going according to plan.  KnC says the Neptune is currently in the foundry phase; that is, the ASICs are already in production. However, even if something goes wrong, KnC has a 'plan B' in case of any major delays.  The Neptune is expected to reduce power consumption by 43% thanks to the use of a new 20nm node.  In addition to the new manufacturing process, the design has been optimised too, allowing KnC to squeeze 1,440 cores in a 55 x 55mm package. To put this in perspective, Intel's 4th generation Core chips feature a 37.5 x 32mm package and they are manufactured on Intel's 22nm node.  KnC says the Neptune ASIC will deliver at least 3TH/s, operating at 0.7W per GH/s.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | LTC | MINING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/19/kncminer-accepting-pre-orders-for-first-scrypt-miner-titan,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5240e33211b302a479fba011e10aff103823a52d-1000x662.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The digital currency exchange has assured customers that it is going to cover the losses out of its own pocket, although it didn't confirm the total number of bitcoins lost.  In a post on the Bitcoin Talk forum, a CoinEX.pw representative under the username 'erundook' said:  ""Long story short: yes, our wallet server got hacked and all funds were withdrawn.""  He also asked users to keep calm and asserted the company's operators are not ""doing a runner"".  Erundook (real name Vitaly A. Sorokin) mentioned that the company has suffered similar problems in the past and, in those instances, it covered the losses.  Of the recent hack, the company spokesperson said: ""The only way I can see to restore this is to sell more shares at cryptostocks to cover the losses *and to hire a professional security audit team to prevent this from happening again*. Long story short, we're covering this from our own pockets again.""  On 16th March, CoinEX.pw indicated on Twitter that it was facing problems.    Security issue, investigating      — CoinEX.pw (@CoinexPW) March 16, 2014    However, the company did not issue any further updates until yesterday evening.  Concerned customers noted that the exchange's co-founder (erundook) had deleted his personal Twitter profile and his Gist page on Github, which detailed CoinEX.pw's API documentation.  Erundook suggested he did so because he was scared of the response he would get from users. The response from those on Bitcoin Talk has been largely positive, thanking erundook for the update, but criticising him for taking so long to deliver it.  Some have not been so understanding, though. Forum member Albinito said:    ""I really wonder whats wrong with some people. Imagine running a jewelry store or money exchange without insurance, beeing robbed several times, waiting for the final blow before thinking about security. There are no words to describe this way of working.      It is quite obvious that you are not capable of running a business like this.

42376992,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vzch,1395225625,"Fortress, Benchmark and Ribbit Team up with Pantera for Bitcoin Fund","Investment firms Fortress Investment Group (FIG), Benchmark Capital and Ribbit Capital have teamed up with Pantera Capital to launch a bitcoin investment fund.  The new fund will be known as Pantera Bitcoin Partners LLC and, as the name implies, it will be controlled by Pantera. Fortress, Ribbit Capital and Benchmark Capital will be minority equity partners.  Fortress  became the first Wall Street investment firm to enter the bitcoin space. Last year it was rumoured to be acquiring bitcoins and a regulatory filing published in February revealed it had set aside $20m for bitcoin investments in 2013.  The company also reported a loss of $3.7m on its bitcoin investment.  Crunching numbers  Fortress has an estimated $58bn in assets under management, so it might be unfazed by the initial loss.  Back in December Pantera Capital (which manages money for FIG executives) created an investment advisor entity named Pantera Bitcoin Advisors LLC. At the time it was listed as a hedge fund with a total value of $147m. Pantera reportedly invested $10m in Bitstamp last year.  Fortress, Benchmark and Ribbit just recently invested in Xapo, a bitcoin storage and security service. In the past, Fortress has dabbled in high-tech investments such as Twitter and eBay, and Ribbit has invested in Coinbase and BTCJam.  The launch of Pantera Bitcoin Partners LLC comes hot on the heels of a digital currency regulatory push in New York. Earlier this month New York State started accepting applications for digital currency exchanges.  The decision was the culmination of an initiative launched by Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of financial services for the State of New York. The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) held several highly publicised hearings on the matter in January.  Pantera goes all-in  According to the Wall Street Journal, Pantera is shifting its investment focus ""solely to bitcoin ventures.""  Pantera chief excutive Dan Morehead says he is fascinated by the promise that bitcoin can fundamentally change the way people interact with money. ""So about a year ago, I decided to begin investing in bitcoin and devoting my full attention to it,"" he said.  The firm's staff is now fully focused on digital currencies, a far cry from macroeconomic hedge-fund strategies, currencies and interest rates that were Pantera's main focus in the past.  Changing the bitcoin landscape  Over the last few months bitcoin's public image has been eroded by arrests, bitcoin heists and, of course, the collapse of Mt. Gox. However, these headline-grabbing events did not deter investors, quite the opposite in fact.  The pieces of the puzzle may be shifting, but they are starting to fall into place. Regulation might not be a problem, at least not in New York and a few other jurisdictions.  Is the Mt. Gox debacle a good argument for regulation? Some argue that it will attract investors to secure platforms headed by Wall Street veterans. Why deal with shady exchanges set up by enthusiasts and coders if there are regulated alternatives set up by reputable investment firms? That is a question many parties will undoubtedly ask if more institutional investors get on board.  Perseus Telecom  recently teamed up with Atlas ATS to announce the launch of a globally integrated bitcoin exchange. Perseus also launched the Digital Currency Initiative (DCI) with the aim of making sure that bitcoin investors get the same level of financial institution security as other public market investors.  Pereus is a major provider of high-bandwidth communications platforms used by trading firms, hedge funds and financial media. It has a strong presence in numerous markets, including financial hubs like London, New York, Tokyo and Singapore.  Telecom EMEA head of business development Carl Weir described the collapse of Mt. Gox as a ""learning opportunity."" It was also a way of saying bitcoin investors were taught a painful lesson.  Oddly enough, the arrest of Charlie Shrem coincided with the NYDFS hearings, while the collapse of Mt. Gox occurred just a few weeks before Perseus, FIG, Pantera and other players made their move.  In the grand scheme of things, could Shrem's and Karpeles' falls from grace be the excuse institutional investors and regulators were looking for all along?

42377006,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vzt3,1395214994,Litecoin Tops $20 As Traders Await Addition to China's Huobi Exchange,"The price of litecoin surged across major exchanges in anticipation of Huobi, one of the largest China-based digital currency exchanges, officially adding support for litecoin trading today.  The exchange added to the anticipation after announcing the news last week by adding a 'moon landing' countdown clock to its site:  As of press time, the price of litecoin on exchanges BTC-e and Bitfinex had hit a high of $20.25 and $20.33, respectively, before dropping to $19.35 and $19.39. These figures were up from opening prices of $17.49 and $17.50, according to data from BitcoinWisdom. Against bitcoin, the litecoin price also hit highs of 0.033 BTC earlier in the day before falling back to 0.030 BTC, still far higher than recent prices and yesterday's 0.028 BTC.  The news is particularly welcome for the litecoin community, as litecoin prices had remained down substantially from a peak of $48 observed last November, the time when many traders began to turn to litecoin as a long-term investment option that could one day pay bitcoin-sized dividends.  News spread quickly about litecoin's potential beginning in early November, and its market cap quickly passed the $100m and $200m milestones within days amid a swift boom in the currency's popularity.  However, litecoin has more recently seen a decline in value to the low teens following a string of bad bitcoin news.  Litecoin's long stagnation  The day's excitement was particular welcome for the community given that it has watched as litecoin, once the assumed frontrunner for the title of number two digital currency, has faced threats from ascendant competitors dogecoin and auroracoin, the latter which recently passed litecoin in market cap before retreating to fourth place.  Litecoin's decline in value also coincided with continued setbacks regarding its addition to Mt. Gox. Given the exchange's then top-tier status, this was long viewed as a potential benchmark for litecoin, though plans have been shelved indefinitely in the wake of the Japan-based exchange's bankruptcy.  Further, in recent months, critics of community began to question whether litecoin provided any new innovations to digital currency, even while supporters maintained that litecoin could persist simply as a reliable, lower-cost alternative to bitcoin.  New momentum  Due in part to this long lull, launch expectations were high on the litecoin thread throughout the day, with one user even creating a dedicated countdown clock for interested litecoin fans and traders.  Litecoin has gained new movement in recent weeks as China-based exchanges have moved quickly to add the currency. Though Huobi was rumored to be working on adding litecoin since February, it was not the exchange that triggered the recent rise. Rather, it was BTC China that added the digital currency first on 4th March, introducing 0% commission on trading.  By 9 pm GMT, the price of litecoin on BTC-e and Bitfinex rose to $19.70 and $19.80, respectively, in anticipation.  Still, even with the additions, a portion of investors may simply be using the price increase to cut losses and break with the digital currency.  As such, the true test of whether it retains momentum will likely be seen in the coming days and weeks.

42376996,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vzgT,1395208966,Is Bitcoin a Digital Currency or a Virtual One?,"Is bitcoin a virtual currency, a digital currency, or both? And why does it matter?  In press reports, it's often referred to as both. The Bangkok Post today refers to ""virtual currencies including the bitcoin"", while the Toronto Star describes the collapse of a bitcoin exchange after hackers stole its ""digital currency"". But digital and virtual currencies are two different things, with different behaviours.  It's more than a semantic distinction: it's a discussion of how a form of money functions.  If we replace the word 'currency' with 'economy', then the distinction may be clearer. When we hear 'digital economy', then we generally think of money whizzing its way electronically around the world, and being used in real life interactions. If we say 'virtual economy', then the first thing that many of us will think of is Second Life, EVE Online, or World of Warcraft.  Perhaps that's why Peter Earle divides it into cryptocurrencies vs. 'simulated' or 'game' currencies. Earle is the chief economist at Humint, a marketing agency that is planning to launch altcoin services for brands, and also handles economies for multiplayer online games.  ""The main difference is that the latter are typically limited to use within a bounded, specified economic system,"" he says.  Virtual currencies may have value against real-world currency, but that doesn't necessarily make them easily exchangeable.  ""They tend to be subject to one-way flows: real-world money is converted into simulated/game currencies, but not back out,"" says Earle. ""This is because game/simulated currencies are essentially goods, and not an actual medium of exchange.""  Gold in World of Warcraft is generally exchanged mostly within the game.That isn't to say that it doesn't get traded with other currencies through third-party exchanges, but that isn't its purpose. Instead, it oils the wheels for everything else that happens in the game, and that is its sole purpose. The same goes for Eve Online, which uses the ISK as its unit of exchange, or Second Life, which uses the Linden.  Currency usage matters  There's another key difference between in-game virtual currency, and a digital currency used extensively outside the boundaries of a virtual world: their usage. In online game worlds, the issuers of the currency are created for a specific purpose.  Charles Hoskinson, cryptographer and co-founder of the Ethereum cryptocurrency framework, describes virtual currencies like these as ""tokens"".  ""A central entity issues the tokens and then they're used for specific contexts. They can appreciate real-world value though. So WoW and Eve Online ISK do have a market price,"" he says. ""This is why people in China spend days earning them.""  They do this via a process known as gold farming, where banks of player-workers manually play games to accrue gold or other in-game currencies. This can then be exchanged for fiat currency: if people don't want to spend time in the game earning their fortune, then they can buy their way in. But that's a long way from making the currency properly and systematicallly exchangeable.  [post-quote]  However, these behaviours extend beyond mere in-game currencies, argues Wences Caseres, who founded mobile payments network Lemon, and who just launched a mobile wallet called Xapo. There is another type of asset with those characteristics, that is used in the real world: loyalty points. Like in-game currencies, these are issued by a central body.  ""Virtual currencies are owned and controlled by a counterparty (Facebook credits, American Airlines miles, American Express Points, etc) and you have to trust that counterparty since it is up to them to set the value and redemption rules. Digital currencies on the other hand are designed in a way in which, just like with gold, you do not need to trust anyone.""  What we've been describing here are what Hoskinson refers to as three core characteristics of money. The first, exchangeability, involves the ability to switch something for a different currency. The second is the ability to act as a store of value, meaning that an asset will more or less hold its value over time without suffering from massive fluctuations. The third is to be a unit of account (usable widely, rather than to buy virtually-drafted broadswords and breastplates).  Virtual currencies, as used in games, exhibit few of these characteristics, except maybe the ability to hold value. But what about bitcoin?  What should we call bitcoin?  Bitcoin is exchangeable, and it isn't used just to keep a game or a loyalty points system running. So does that make it a digital currency, rather than a virtual one? CoinDesk generally describes it as such, but Hoskinson doesn't agree. In fact, he doesn't think it's a currency at all.  It is also working its way towards becoming a unit of account, in which it is used to price goods and services, and doesn't need to be referenced against anything else for its value.  This is the holy grail for a currency: if you can live your life using it, without worrying about having to transfer it to any other form of exchange, then you know it's arrived. ""Bitcoin is getting there, with about 15,000 products and services available, maybe more,"" Hoskinson says.  It also needs to be a store of value. so that value can be deposited in it, and then retrieved at a later date, while still having held that value, or at least decayed in value at a predictable rate. Bitcoin's suitability here is open for debate.  Although many advocates talk up its long-term value, bitcoin has jumped and plunged in value at various points over the last year. You wouldn't want to store your life savings in it today, and even unit trust and ETF managers are saying that it isn't yet a vehicle for retail investment.  ""We want it to be predictable, because that gives you the ability to issue credit. Which is one of the most important things in an economy,"" says Hoskinson. ""It behaves much more like a digital commodity, or a tech stock.""  That's certainly how some are classifying it. Finland recently decided that it was a commodity, and the Bank of England thinks that it looks rather similar to one, too. And Goldman Sachs doesn't think it's a currency either.  This makes the case (at least for the time being) for cryptocurrencies to be in a class of their own – neither digital currencies, nor virtual. Once they strongly satisfy those three underlying standards for money, they could be technically considered currencies. The 'crypto' would simply be a subcategory.  So, technically speaking, bitcoin could be described as a cryptocurrency. Or a digital currency in waiting. But for now, we'll use 'cryptocurrency' and 'digital currency' interchangeably at CoinDesk. That's easier to type than 'crypto-proto-digital currency/commodity'.
