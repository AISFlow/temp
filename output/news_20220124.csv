42423836,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2hBFh,1643066940,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Stabilizes Above $36K as Investors Await Next Fed Meeting,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Market moves: Bitcoin retakes $36,000 as the crypto market stabilized after last week’s correction.  Technician's take: Extreme oversold readings preceded an uptick in BTC.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $36,547 +0.1%  Ether (ETH): $2,426 -4.6%  Top gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Cosmos ATOM +5.4% Smart Contract Platform Bitcoin BTC +0.7% Currency  Top losers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Solana SOL −8.5% Smart Contract Platform Algorand ALGO −7.3% Smart Contract Platform Filecoin FIL −6.4% Computing  Sector classifications are provided via the Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS), developed by CoinDesk Indices to provide a reliable, comprehensive, and standardized classification system for digital assets. The CoinDesk 20 is a ranking of the largest digital assets by volume on trusted exchanges.  Markets  S&P 500: 4,410 +0.2%  DJIA: 34,364 +0.2%  Nasdaq: 13,855 +0.6%  Gold: $1,843 +0.4%  Market moves  Bitcoin’s price rose by as much as $1,834 on a four-hour basis during U.S. trading hours on Monday, after it briefly touched the $34,000 level during Asia's late afternoon. The overall crypto market stabilized after the broad market correction downward in the past week.  Bitcoin is currently changing hands at around $36,400 and is up slightly in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data. At the time of publication, ether was down slightly, trading at about $2,400. Most of the major alternative coins (altcoins) were in the red.  The U.S. equity market also rebounded in the late afternoon on Monday. Major stock indices tumbled earlier in the day as investors closely watch the Federal Reserve's first meeting this year, which will take place this week.  While bitcoin and the crypto market appeared to be following the performance of the stock market recently, as CoinDesk reported, the relationship between bitcoin and the Nasdaq 100 stock index, the favored proxy for the tech sector, remains weak – a reminder there are other more important factors that could affect bitcoin and the crypto market.  “For the time being at least, one could say bitcoin’s prices are a combination of some global risk appetite and a lot of the market dynamics in China (and the aftermath of restrictions there),” CoinDesk’s Lawrence Lewitinn wrote. “Those factors’ influences aren’t static, but they explain a lot more than watching the Fed’s every move.”  According to crypto trading data analytic firm Kaiko, despite a sharp sell-off last week, bitcoin’s daily spot trading volume last week was still lower than it was during December’s price plunge.  The average daily spot trading volume of bitcoin on major cryptocurrency exchanges has mostly remained below $5 billion in the past month, down significantly since early fall, Kaiko wrote in its weekly newsletter on Monday. This is partly because Chinese exchanges OKEx and Huobi have suffered volume loss due to the crypto trading ban in China last year.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Short-Term Bounce Faces Resistance at $40K  Bitcoin (BTC) returned above $35,000 after multiple oversold signals appeared on the charts. The cryptocurrency faces initial resistance at $40,000, which could limit upside over the short term.  Bitcoin is up 3% over the past 24 hours after rising from an intraday low near $33,000, while the broader crypto market has stabilized.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart registered the most extreme oversold reading since the March 2020 crash. The previous extreme low was on Nov. 20, 2018, which preceded a few months of rangebound price action before a rally took place.  For now, a downtrend of lower price highs since November remains intact, which means sellers could remain active at resistance levels.

Coinbase shares hit a low of about $162.54 on Monday morning, down more than 60% from their 52-week high of $429.54 and down 35% from their opening reference price of $250 when the company went public last April.

42422883,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qZLh,1643059375,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Stabilizes as Altcoins Underperform,"Cryptocurrencies are starting to stabilize after declining sharply over the past week. Some indicators show investor sentiment at extremely bearish levels, which typically precede periods of buying activity. Other technical measures, however, suggest choppy price action could persist over the short term.  Bitcoin returned to above $35,000 and was up 3% over the past 24 hours, versus a 5% decline in SOL and roughly flat performance in ETH over the same period.  Still, it might be too soon to call a price bottom. ""I think the determination of a bull/bear market is not as clear as previous cycles, due to the structure of the market changing drastically with institutions entering the space,"" Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at the U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  ""Now, it is apparent that bitcoin is in a ranging environment (between $29,000 to $69,000 approximately) rather than a trending environment,"" Sotiriou wrote.  ""Bitcoin’s recovery is a long shot as investors are more keen on the price being stabilized for now,"" Alex Axelrod, founder and CEO of Aximetria, a crypto financial services firm, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. Axelrod is monitoring BTC price levels of between $32,000 and $40,000 for confirmation of a breakdown or breakout.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $36925, +4.41%    ●Ether (ETH): $2448, +0.88%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4410, +0.28%    ●Gold: $1842 per troy ounce, +0.56%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 1.74%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  The chart below shows the recent increase in bitcoin's spot trading volume. Short-term traders have been active despite the uncertainty regarding future price direction.  Short-term holders underwater  Losses are adding up for most short-term bitcoin holders, according to blockchain data.  The chart below indicates that 18% of short-term bitcoin holder supply is at a loss (BTC trading below its average cost basis), which could point to further selling. A similar scenario occurred during the 2018 bear market and subsequent price corrections.  Still, long-term bitcoin holders appear unfazed by the recent price dip. ""The proportion of long-term holder supply has actually returned to a modest uptrend, which indicates a general unwillingness for this cohort to liquidate,"" Glassnode, a crypto data firm, wrote in a blog post on Monday.  Crypto funds attract fresh capital  Inflows into digital-asset funds last week – after five straight weeks of outflows – suggest investors were taking advantage of the price dip.  Cryptocurrency funds brought in $14.4 million of new investor money during the seven days through Friday, ending a streak of five straight weeks of outflows, according to a report Monday from the digital-asset manager CoinShares.  Last week's inflows were led by bitcoin-focused funds, which brought in $13.8 million. Meanwhile, ethereum-focused funds suffered $15.6 million of outflows. Read more here.

42411851,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgayn,1643059140,Minting Your First NFT: A Beginner’s Guide to Creating an NFT,"I’m no Emily Dickinson, but the latest developments in internet culture – excuse me, Web3 culture – has me thinking I can shill my grad school poems for 1 ETH (ether) a pop.  And on January 20, 2022, I did. After all, imposter syndrome doesn’t have a place in a burgeoning industry where even founders admit to being in the midst of a learning curve. If I were a creator during Gutenberg’s era, I like to think I wouldn’t have passed up the chance to play around with the printing press. Why should NFTs be different?  When I first heard about non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in April 2021, I was immediately thrilled by the high-level concept of them: Artists, seemingly overnight, now had a way to own their own work and determine their own royalties. I needed to hear more.  Being a journalist, I was fortunate that my first conversation about NFTs was with Whale Shark, a prominent collector and founder of the WHALE token who once spent 22 ETH on a one-of-a-kind pair of sneakers.  Ahead, I share what I’ve learned since that first NFT conversation and my chats with dozens of creators and founders in the blockchain world. As they say in crypto, time moves so fast. One month is basically a year, and it took me about seven months – essentially one whole dog year – to finally work up the nerve to put one of my poems on a blockchain. I’d like to make it easier for you.  Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to mint your first NFT using OpenSea, a popular NFT platform among first-time creators. (Great alternative platforms also exist, which we’ll touch on below.)  Step 1: Decide on the concept  Outside of my financial journalistic work, I have a growing affinity for all things astrology-based. Looking at my recent astrology chart with astrologer Noah Frere, I noticed that Juno was very active. In light of this, I decided to base my first NFT collection on the tumultuous relationship between Juno and Jupiter – two gods from Roman mythology. And after a great conversation with my business coach, Lisa Fabrega, I knew I wanted to explore the tension between love and duty through the lens of devotion.  I therefore decided to name my poetry alter ego – every creator needs one, right? – “Juno Muse.”  With my concept nailed down, I had my marching orders: Resurrect my old poems and write several new ones. Then, learn how to mint them on a blockchain.  Step two: Decide on the platform  The tech skills required to mint NFTs on OpenSea are comparable to the ones I used to sign up for Myspace in 2006.  “There's a big misconception that you have to be technical in order to participate in crypto,” said Denise Schaefer, co-founder of the blockchain education platform Surge. “But I look at NFTs as a fun entryway into the space that doesn't require coding skills when minting in marketplaces like OpenSea or Rarible.”  Read More: OpenSea vs. Rarible: Which Is the Better NFT Marketplace?  Here are some beginner-friendly NFT platforms where first-time creators can mint:  OpenSea  Blockchains supported: Ethereum, Polygon, Klaytn, Solana, Arbitrum, Avalanche and Optimism.  OpenSea is popular and easy to use for all types of NFTs. While the Ethereum blockchain is notorious for charging high service fees, or “gas”, OpenSea now has a lazy mint option. The creator can upload their artwork, “mint” it to their profile and list it for sale without paying gas fees. When the collector buys it, they will pay the gas fees.  What you’ll need to get started:  An ETH wallet (e.g. MetaMask, Coinbase or dozens of others)  Creator fees:  2.5% of your sale  Learn more:  Visit the OpenSea resource page.  Rarible  Blockchains used: Ethereum, Flow and Tezos  Creators can use Rarible to mint NFT creations, whether they are books, music albums, digital art or movies. There are some fun features, such as the ability to show a “sneak peek” of your creation to everybody who comes to Rarible but limit the full project to purchasers only.  Rarible considers itself a community-owned NFT marketplace. Using Rarible’s unique token (ERC-20 RARI) makes you an owner of the Rarible project. This is a cool feature, but it was a little over my head for my first mint. I hope to learn more about this.  What you’ll need to get started:  A wallet compatible with your choice of blockchain.  Creator fees:  Vary depending on the blockchain you use, but the option for free minting exists.  Learn more:  Read the Rarible FAQs  Holaplex  Blockchain used: Solana  While Solana has mixed reviews from Ethereum loyalists, artists and creators report that the Solana blockchain is super fast, has high performance and is cost-effective with negligible fees. Solana’s speed and efficiency also cuts down on energy usage, therefore giving it a reputation as a new, less environmentally damaging, alternative to Ethereum.  What you’ll need to get started:  Phantom wallet and Arconnect Wallet  Creator fees:  Reportedly 0.000005 SOL ($0.00025) per transaction. Fees can fluctuate, but they are almost zero.  Learn more:  Check out this Artist’s Guide to Solana and Holaplex and visit the Holaplex.  Objkt  Blockchain used: Tezos  Originally created as a secondary marketplace, objkt now allows artists and creators to mint directly on its platform. It’s also popular among literary NFT creators and used by theVerseVerse co-founders Sasha Stiles and Ana Maria Caballero.  What you’ll need to get started:  Choose from these compatible wallets:  Spire  Temple Wallet  Galleon  Kukai Wallet  Umami  AirGap Wallet  Creator fees:  2.5% for all successful sales  Learn more:  Visit the objkt website and/or discord server.  Step three: Connect and build community  Get ready to tweet and DM. If you want to start making NFTs, you’ll need to dust off your Twitter account. You’ll also need to join Discord, a Slack-like chat platform for gamers and crypto lovers. Expect to get most of your information and build authentic relationships through these types of communication channels.  Read more: Crypto Discord: Where to Go, What to Know  When you’re ready to sell your NFTs, expect your community to be your number-one marketing resource. It sounds a little cliche, but you don’t need to spend a lot of money on sophisticated marketing tactics to create a successful project.  “Regardless of how low or high the market is, the community is so enthusiastic and constantly tagging our project in different things constantly talking about it,” said Maliha Abidi, whose Women Rise NFT collection launched in November 2021 and sold out in 50 days, generating 2,000 ETH of trading volume in the process.  “We have not put in even $1 in marketing so far, but we were literally just featured in Vanity Fair yesterday and today in Rolling Stone,” Abidi told CoinDesk on Jan. 19.  Even 1-of-1 creators – artists who mint unique, single pieces of art, compared to algorithmically generated avatars that people use as Twitter profile pictures – seemingly trust that making friendships can go a long way.  “We interact with each other every day. You're going to see your collectors in a Twitter space or if there’s good alpha information, we share it with each other,” said Thao Nguyen, an artist who pivoted from making Etsy creations to NFT artwork on OpenSea in 2021. “It's a very giving relationship, and I absolutely love it.”  Step four: Create your art  To start turning my poems into art, I asked my mom to mail me an old iPad she wasn’t using and signed up for an online illustration class at the Baltimore Academy of Illustration. I bought an Apple Pencil, downloaded Photoshop for iPads, and plugged in my Yeti microphone (which I already had) to practice recording audio clips in iMovie and GarageBand. I dug out my old poems from grad school, walked around Manhattan thinking of ideas and bought a notebook to start scribbling.  Every creator has their own process, but no matter what, you need to think about how your art will translate digitally. Follow these guidelines to make your first NFT:  Use materials and tools you already have.  Invest in new technology or knowledge as needed.  Find other creators and learn from each other.  Consider the audience you think will like your work and keep them in mind as you create.  Choose whether you want your NFTs to have visual, audio or written components – or all three.  Pick a file type. OpenSea accepts JPG, PNG, GIF, SVG, MP4, WEBM, MP3, WAV, OGG, GLB and GLTF.  Think about the file size. OpenSea’s limit is 100 MB.  Factor in accessibility – I chose to have subtitles along with my spoken-word poems so that they could be enjoyed by as many people as possible, including people with visual and/or hearing impairments.  After some experimenting, I ended up scrapping the graphics I created in Photoshop and instead used Canva to make a simple title image and subtitles for my poem. I then recorded myself reading the poem along with the slides.  I’m not the most talented visual artist. But I gave myself permission to play around – and I don’t intend to stop experimenting. The advice I’ve gotten is this: Don’t pigeonhole yourself too soon or limit your notions of what’s possible. Unless you have a clear aesthetic like Abidi, an experienced painter, consider NFTs your opportunity to try new things. NFTs are a new art form, so let your message translate to the new medium.  Step five: Mint and share  In OpenSea, the minting process is so easy I kept waiting for a clown to jump out and tell me I’d been tricked.  It’s as simple as uploading your files, inputting your collection’s description and making your profile, determining your royalties (for later, when your art is sold in a secondary marketplace) and completing your listing.  Note the accepted file types:  I chose to mint my first NFT on Polygon, which had no fees.  Once you mint your NFT, you will see it on your profile. Blockchain data is public and accessible by anyone. Your NFT's buying and selling history will be available forever, helping you and prospective investors track its price.  “Etherscan is where you can see all the transactions that have happened in the Ethereum blockchain,” Schaefer told CoinDesk. “It is specific to all transactions that are occurring in the Ethereum network, and in and out of the network. Everybody having access to these public records is what allows for blockchains to operate without a central authority and without a bank.”  But you might not want the whole world to know how much money you have and how much money you're transacting, said Schaefer. This is where pseudonyms and having multiple wallets – totally legal in the blockchain world – come in.  The final step: Selling your NFT  After minting, it’s time to list your NFT for sale. I opted to keep things simple and list mine for 1 ETH, or $2,922.42 at the time of minting.  My 1 ETH price will remain on my Juno Muse OpenSea profile until Feb. 20, or whenever someone takes my NFT off the market.  In the meantime, I plan to keep experimenting with how I price my NFTs. I plan on releasing my old grad school poems, and, to make Juno proud, I plan to keep writing poems on Thursdays, which is ruled by Juno’s love, Jupiter. Maybe, just maybe, this new routine will help me fall in love with NFTs and – most important – my own art again.

42417089,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcRycoP,1643054887,The Trojan Horse of Privacy,"Back in the early 1990s, a rag-tag group of legendary cryptographers battled Big Government's attempts to cripple strong cryptography with everything from key escrow to the infamous clipper chip, which would have given law enforcement a back door to decrypt voice and text messages. The cypherpunks fought back against weak encryption and the U.S. government hijacking everyone's public keys so it could spy on people with ease. The rebels won, beating back the clipper chip and crushing attempts to subvert major encryption standards.  They won the battle but they lost the war.  Dan Jeffries is an author, futurist, systems architect and thinker. This article is part of CoinDesk’s Privacy Week series.  They had a much grander vision that never came to pass. They wanted to make the entire internet private, free from the prying eyes of governments and spy agencies. They wanted a world where we ruled our own personal information and shared it only when we wanted to.  In a famous article in Wired from 1993, Stephen Levy wrote that the cypherpunks dreamed of a world ""where an individual's informational footprints – everything from an opinion on abortion to the medical record of an actual abortion – can be traced only if the individual involved chooses to reveal them; a world where coherent messages shoot around the globe by network and microwave, but intruders and feds trying to pluck them out of the vapor find only gibberish; a world where the tools of prying are transformed into the instruments of privacy.""  Today we have exactly the opposite.  Surveillance economies power our biggest tech companies. Facebook and Google track our every step to deliver surgical ad strikes that make us hungry to buy more stuff we don't need, with money we don't have, to impress people we don't even know. They track where we go, what we like, who we know and love, and with whom we're sleeping.  Even though the Congress smashed the Defense Department’s Total Information Awareness initiative, a program to soak up all the world's data in a massive Orwellian dragnet, U.S. spy agencies built it anyway with “black budgets,” as Edward Snowden’s revelations demonstrated a decade ago. The National Security Agency (NSA) programs Edward Snowden leaked line up perfectly with every single original proposal from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Of course, the U.S. isn't alone in spying on its citizens and the world. Every major spy agency on the planet now has similar capabilities to gobble up private data.  In the hands of authoritarian regimes, such power is devastating, creating a panopticon where the government can peer into every aspect of its citizens' lives. In China, artist and humanist Ai WeiWei managed to blog freely in the early 2000s, but it didn't take long for the Chinese government to get its boot back on the neck of the internet. U.S. companies such as Cisco helped China build the Great Firewall, even creating a custom Falun Gong module to help track down and torture dissidents who belonged to the religious movement.  Everywhere you go, and everyone you meet, and all that you love and hate are sitting in databases waiting for prying private eyes to dissect your life in exquisite detail.  If it sounds like a dystopian sci-fi novel, that's because it is dystopian sci-fi brought to life. But even worse, the scale of it is so large that the average person doesn't even comprehend it. They can't imagine that the people who lead them would do something on such a massive scale.  The rebels of crypto lost their bid to build a privacy-protecting internet. But there's new hope for tomorrow.  Now, a new band of renegades wants to deliver on the promise of the original cypherpunks.  The private world of tomorrow  The biggest technological hope to deliver on those promises are zk-SNARKs.  That’s short for zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge. Basically they allow someone to prove they know something without ever revealing that information to the other person. They have the strange and spooky magic of letting two people store information on a public blockchain so the blockchain can prove the transaction happened, and yet all the information about it, everything from the sender's address to the amount of money sent to the receiver's address, can stay completely private. It's like a ninja hiding in plain sight.  Zero-knowledge proofs came to the mainstream of crypto with privacy coins like zcash. They let us fully replicate the anonymous nature of cash in the digital world. We'll need that because governments already have physical cash in their sights. In a few decades or sooner, they'll make cash illegal and all we'll have is central bank digital surveillance coins that track every single aspect of our lives.  Privacy coins give us a parallel economic operating system that lets us transact freely without worrying about the prying eyes of the panopticon.  But zk-SNARKs go way beyond money. The technologist Vinay Gupta called them “the equivalent of spaceships compared to cave technology” on my podcast. They can revolutionize privacy in thousands of different ways.  Take internet security. Snarks let me prove I know my password without sending it over the wire. That will mean a big uptick in security in apps and on websites. Most people's passwords get hacked not because the hacker attacks their computer directly, but because they attack a big, central database that stores everyone's passwords. If we never have to send or store that password centrally then hackers have to go back to the low-reward grind of hitting each person's computer or phone directly.  Early on, the tech had some downsides. It required a ""trusted setup"" where the founders of a zk-based system would do a big creation ceremony to get it set up and to convince people they didn't add a sneaky backdoor to the system by keeping the one private key to rule them all. But since the early days of zk-SNARKs, researchers all over the world have figured out ways to get the system started without needing a trusted setup.  Now mega-blockchains like Ethereum are going all-in on zk-SNARKS, building in zk-Rollups that allow most transactions to happen off-chain and that will help Ethereum to scale to millions of simultaneous distributed app (dapp) users. Zk-Rollups form the backbone of Ethereum layer 2 solutions.  Zk-SNARKs can do exactly what the cypherpunks dreamed of in those early days of the Internet. They can deliver one-time, untraceable messaging. They can hide everything from monetary transactions to information shared between you and your lover. They can make medical records truly secure. Take something like a visit to your psychiatrist. Your records with your mental health-care provider could contain everything from notes to prescriptions, all of it encrypted. You would be able to share proof that you got a prescription so your health insurance provider can pay for it, but not share your doctor's notes or anything else that was between you and your doctor alone. (Whether the insurance company demands such information is a separate, non-technological question.)  That's true privacy where we're in control of our data and we share what we want to share, when we want to share it. It won't just be zk-SNARKs either. As crypto gets more and more widespread, brilliant cryptographers will continue to deliver new innovations, mathematical flourishes that can keep all our data safe.  Of course, governments will fight privacy at every step. They'll tell us that criminals will use it for bad things. Of course, they will. But so what? They already do bad things with the system we have now. Don't let people fool you that crime suddenly starts with crypto. Crime is as old as civilization. Criminals use cash, the banking system and everything in between. Nobody demands we stop using the U.S. dollar or the euro or your international bank because criminals use it, too. It's a nonsense argument and they know it. What they really don't want is to lose their ability to look into every aspect of our lives.  You don’t have to be a criminal to want privacy. Everyone deserves privacy.  Just as you don’t want someone looking in your window while you change, or looking over your shoulder and reading the emails you send to your best friend, you don’t want a big company watching everything you spend your hard-earned money on so they can advertise more things you don't need or so governments can catch two more bad guys while keeping everything you ever wrote to your lover on file.  Crypto offers a way out of the maze of endless surveillance and an economy where you're the product.  There's only one problem.  Practically nobody cares.  Privacy is not a value proposition  If you're in crypto, you probably think everyone cares about privacy. Most folks in the crypto space feel like the value of privacy is obvious and that nobody in their right mind would choose a state-backed surveillance coin or ubiquitous government watchdogs over a borderless, decentralized, privacy-protecting system. That’s just selection bias at work. They’re in the community because they believe in decentralization and privacy, but in the scheme of things it’s a tiny community.  The average person doesn’t care about privacy in the least. They don’t know what it means. They certainly won't pay for it at the moment. How many people pay for encrypted email versus just using Gmail? A tiny fraction of a percentage, even though Google's AI algorithms are reading everything they write. It's free. That's what matters to people even if they watch scary documentaries on Big Tech spying on them. They watch the horror story like any other Saturday entertainment, get mad about it over dinner and then change absolutely nothing.  Remember this interview with Snowden about government surveillance on John Oliver’s show? Oliver went to interview Snowden in Russia, where he's in exile.  Watch the look on Snowden’s face when he realizes the average man on the street doesn’t know a damn thing about privacy and doesn’t care about it in the least! The only time they care is when the government has their dick pic on file.  Most folks who grew up in an open, democratic society and never experienced anything different in their entire life don't think it matters because it didn't matter all that much. I’ve got nothing to hide, they think. They never lived in East Berlin where the Stasi could show up at your house and take you away for any reason, at any time. When soldiers arrest you on made-up charges for anything, the value of privacy gets very real. They'd pay for it then, but by then it's too late.  There's only one way to give people privacy.  A Trojan horse.  The gift of privacy  For the dream of Web 3 and the new crypto renegades to work we have to think differently. We need to think of apps first and privacy second. We need to make privacy the foundation of the app but keep it cleverly disguised in a beautiful wrapper that works flawlessly and easily.  For privacy to really take off, privacy needs to stop being the value proposition. It's got to be a gift that people don't even notice.  When people are downloading apps that work as easily as Instagram but have privacy baked right in, that's how we get our privacy back. We get it when nobody has to think about it, when it's just background noise in a new app explosion. Make privacy the plumbing, not the marketing tagline.  But it's bigger than that. too. In my post “The Five Keys to Crypto Evolution,” I wrote that for decentralized, nationless, privacy-preserving systems to take off they need to be more than just money. They need to be a complete and total self-contained economy. The system needs to distribute the money, offer privacy at every level, exchange the money automatically, and offer amazing goods and services denominated in that money all without ever needing a change back to traditional, nation-state fiat currency.  Decentralized stacks need to gamify the delivery of money, remove any and all centralized choke points like exchanges, and create a super-compelling ecosystem of goods and services that nobody can resist.  In other words, there aren't really five keys. There's one big key.  We need a complete alternative to the surveillance economy.  If the only way developers and Big Tech companies can make money is by spying on you, that's exactly what they'll do. No amount of evangelizing privacy or creating awesome new cryptographic tricks like zk-SNARKS will change that hard economic reality. That's the most essential step. Change the economics. If you're working in blockchain and decentralization and privacy, first come up with the economic model.  How will people make money? How easy is it? How can you make it even easier? Then make it even easier than that.  Humans are very simple creatures. If we can do the right thing but we'll starve, we'll take the food every time.  If you're a new-wave cypherpunk and you want to succeed where the original cypherpunks failed then you've got to see the bigger picture of human nature and economic reality.  Give developers a new way to feed themselves and give everyone else privacy as a bonus.  Get that right and you'll give us a world where we can draw the curtains instead of a world where every window is open and private eyes are always watching you.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Dan Jeffries,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/01/24/the-trojan-horse-of-privacy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a7575b30ac00ddc90f85fec855c4d10b08b4a828-1440x1084.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to data from CoinGecko, nearly $700 billion of value has been erased when the market correction sent bitcoin (BTC) down 28% for the year to date and ether (ETH) fell 40%.  The new figures imply cryptocurrency market capitalization has roughly halved since its all-time high around $3.1 trillion in November.  “Crypto winter” flashback  It's not unusual for highly volatile cryptocurrencies to experience swift and devastating drawdowns with magnitudes exceeding 50%.  In April 2013, the price of bitcoin rallied to a high of $230 from just $13 in January. Within days, bitcoin suffered a steep drop to $68, a decline of 70%.  The last crypto bull run in 2017-2018 saw a similar pattern – a swift, parabolic price pump, then a steep drawdown within subsequent weeks.  During the 2018 sell-off, crypto market capitalization plummeted from a high of $850 billion in January to $130 billion in December, a staggering decline of 85%.  It took three years for bitcoin to return to its 2017 all-time high, marking a painful period veteran HODL-ers remember as “crypto winter.”  While the drawdowns vary in magnitude with each subsequent crypto cycle, it appears the ""supercycle"" hypothesis – that crypto is on the verge of mass adoption – floated by some traders last year is dead in the water.  Pockets of safety  For some traders, the emergence of major altcoins in the current cycle appears to be providing some reprieve from the sea of red.  As the cryptocurrency space matures, bitcoin and ether dominance has been on the decline, meaning altcoins are making up a larger chunk of the broader cryptocurrency market cap.  Tokens such as Fantom’s FTM (-21% year to date) and Cosmos’ ATOM (-7%) have outperformed both bitcoin (-28%) and ether (-40%).  Traders who were long FTM and ATOM and hedged positions with short selling on BTC or ETH were still able to make profits. Short selling occurs when an investor borrows a security (or in this case a cryptocurrency), sells it on the open market and expects to buy it back later for less.  Meanwhile, some of 2021’s hottest tokens such as Polygon’s MATIC (-44%), Solana’s SOL (-51%) and Avalanche’s AVAX (-48%) have notched steep losses in less than a month.

ETH, the native asset of the Ethereum network, is down to around $2,200 for the first time since July. Bitcoin hit a similar six-month low in the $33,000 range.

With a dip in the market comes a wave of “takes” from crypto’s armchair prognosticators. Depending on whom you trust, these are either short-term macro trends (tech stocks like Peloton and Netflix are way down, too) or the first rumblings of a promised “crypto winter,” the kind of thing last seen during the post-crash environment of 2018.  Well, here’s another take – it’s a bad time to be a day trader, but it’s also a bad time for NFT flippers, whose gains and losses are typically priced in ETH. Even as the price has fallen, the average amount of ETH exchanged for non-fungible tokens in top collections has stayed relatively consistent.  The Consumer Price Index (CPI), which tracks an aggregate price of certain consumer goods, is a useful real-world analog here. People like to think of the CPI as a rough gauge for inflation – when the dollar is worth less, you’d expect dollar-denominated prices to go up. It rose 7% in 2021, through December, in the biggest spike since 1982.  That is to say, you’re probably going to be paying a little more for some of the consumer goods you use everyday.  Somehow, this logic doesn’t seem to apply to crypto’s top NFT collections.  A week ago, the “floor prices” (the lowest listed price for a token in a given NFT collection) for CryptoPunks and the Bored Ape Yacht Club, now the two priciest projects in the space, were 60 ETH and 82 ETH, respectively.  They’ve each crept up a little, from 60 ETH to 66, and 82 ETH to 86 – but these minor increases aren’t doing much to offset the massive dip in the price of ETH, which lost 30% of its value over the past seven days.  See also: The History of HODL  The same goes for other top NFT collections. The floor for Meebits, a 3D collection from the developers of CryptoPunks, has actually dropped over the past week, as has the floor for CyberKongz.  Average sale prices for tokens over the past seven days tell a similar story; minor increases and decreases here and there, but nothing that could really offset the dip.  So, why is everyone accepting less for these valuable NFTs across the board?  My sense is that it has to do with who’s actually buying this stuff. At this point, CryptoPunks and Bored Apes are the domain of hardcore crypto enthusiasts (VCs, full-time investors) and rich celebrities. Your average ETH trader, maybe a little less risk tolerant, probably isn’t focusing on these collections.  Hardcore ETH people tend to think of ETH on its own terms. Spend enough time in crypto and 1 ETH just starts to look like 1 ETH, as opposed to $2,200.  If you really believe in the thesis behind NFTs (and, by extension, the ETH backing most of the market), you believe in the viability of the tokens themselves. And if ETH is going up and we’re all going to the moon, you may not care about a short-term price correction.  What looks like a loss today could be seen as a bet on the long-term value of ETH. Nothing’s ever real until you sell, right?

The NFTs have been created in collaboration with the cult toy brand Superplastic and co-designed by Gucci's head of design, Alessandro Michele. Each NFT will be given away with a ceramic sculpture handmade in Italy and co-designed by Gucci. The NFT drop will be Gucci’s first.  Superplastic is a company that makes artistic vinyl toys for the collectibles market and has issued NFTs through the Winklevoss-owned Nifty Gateway. Superplastic was launched in 2018 by Kidrobot founder Paul Budnitz and has sold millions of dollars in designer toys and apparel based on characters Janky & Guggimon, Dayzee & Staxx, Kranky, ShüDog.  On Friday, Gucci tweeted about the roadmap and launch of a Discord channel as a place to encourage open conversations with the community about what’s next in the metaverse.  Digital fashion momentum  In May, designer fans were left stunned when a virtual Gucci Dionysus bag was sold on the gaming platform Roblox for 350,000 Robux, or roughly $4,115 at the time. The same physical purse cost $3,400.  Reddit co-founder and VC investor Alexis Ohanian was quick to point out in a tweet, “Remember: this Roblox purse is not an NFT and thus has no value/use/transferability outside the Roblox world – yet it's worth more than the physical one.”  The Superplastic collaboration seems to represent a change of course.  Read more: Prada, Adidas Launch NFT Project on Polygon  Luxury fashion brands are already making millions of dollars from auctioning NFTs. In September, Dolce & Gabbana launched its NFT collection, Collezione Genesi, which fetched approximately $5.65 million in a sale.  With more fashion brands launching NFTs, many are asking if this is a transformational moment for the fashion industry or merely a bout of trendhopping.  Luxury fashion brand Prada and sportswear giant Adidas announced last week the launch of an NFT project built on the Polygon network that allows fans to contribute their own designs.  Morgan Stanley predicts the total NFT market is expected to grow to $300 billion by 2030 with brands such as Gucci and Balenciaga in the best position to profit from digital collaborations in the metaverse.

This may suggest that the market volatility will be lesser in the near future. Bitcoin Open Interest Drops To Similar Levels As In September 2021 As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC open interest has decreased to similar levels as last September following the crash. The &apos;open interest&apos; is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin futures contracts currently open in the derivatives market. The metric accounts for both long and short positions. When the value of the indicator increases, it means more money is entering into the derivatives market as investors open more positions. The volatility in the price of Bitcoin usually rises in such scenarios as it implies leverage in the market is going up, and so a liquidation squeeze may be coming. On the other hand, when the open interest declines in value, it means holders are closing up their futures positions. The resulting lower leverage environment usually leads to lower price volatility.

42390160,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bVmCUL,1643044485,The Privacy Boom Is Going to Change Everything,"Early this month, Hayley Tsukuyama was talking to an American legislator about digital privacy. It’s one of the main topics of concern for the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), where she works as a legislative activist.  The unnamed legislator was eager not just to learn more about threats to privacy, but to share a disturbing story.  This article is part of CoinDesk's Privacy Week series.  The lawmaker had recently heard that Target, by using data gathered about the shopping habits of a teenage customer, had determined that she was pregnant. Target then sent flyers and coupons for maternity goods to the girl’s home – where her parents were shocked to learn the joyful news from a massive corporate retailer.  To many, this will sound more unlucky than strange. For better or worse, we’ve gotten used to both massive, omnipresent data gathering and the swirl of uncanny targeted advertising from social media companies, online retailers and assorted attention merchants.  But here’s the most notable thing about the Target story that so scandalized that lawmaker: It happened a full decade ago.  From Snowden to Cambridge Analytica  Tsukuyama’s conversation encapsulates our slow awakening to the challenges and risks of digital surveillance: We’re finally catching on to a problem that has been with us for a long time.  When Charles Duhig of the New York Times unmasked Target’s newfangled “data analytics” methods in 2012, they still seemed mysterious, novel, maybe even exciting. Tech companies like Facebook were enjoying a public honeymoon period, celebrated as the Next Big Thing in the American economy.  But that naïve optimism has been largely washed away by a slowly mounting “techlash,” as one controversy after another reveals just how much privacy we’ve lost to digital surveillance. An early turning point came in 2013, when Edward Snowden disclosed the National Security Agency’s illegal spying program. The outrage that followed showed that Americans were no longer fully on board for the antidemocratic government security measures that prevailed for the decade after 9/11.  Government spying wasn’t the only problem, and maybe not even the biggest one. Expert warnings about online surveillance date back as far as the mid-2000s – one of my own mentors, Mark Andrejevic, published an entire book on the subject in 2007. But the issue was abstract for many Americans until the presidential election in 2016.  “Cambridge Analytica served as a wakeup call and crystallized a lot of inchoate discontent,” said Jay Stanley, a privacy expert with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The U.K. firm allegedly misused Facebook data and systems on behalf of then-candidate Donald Trump.  “The fact that it was tied to the 2016 election was a shock,” Stanley continues. “It was a demonstration of how much actual power and potential power big tech companies have, and just how sloppy they can be with our privacy.”  The idea that Facebook helped hand the presidency to Trump was always something of a convenient dodge for the feckless Democratic Party – but it also drew attention to real problems that the company, a half-decade later, still hasn’t convincingly addressed. In fact, subsequent reporting only added to public outrage, for instance with findings that Facebook targeted users with negative content to drive clicks, despite its own research on the mental health harms of those practices.  Meanwhile, psychologists, sociologists and journalists have been uncovering even broader fallouts from the dizzying cocktail of surveillance and targeted advertising. Jean Twenge has documented the grim psychological effects digital echo chambers are having on teenagers. “The Age of Surveillance Capitalism,” written by no less an establishment figure than Harvard Business School professor Shoshana Zuboff, has become a touchstone for critics of platforms’ exploitative data hoarding.  This wave of revelations has sharpened public distrust of internet companies that collect user data. In 2014, 24% of Americans still believed they could be securely anonymous online, according to Pew Research Center. By 2019, fully 62% believed they could not escape monitoring by private companies, not just online, but in their broader daily lives.  In a December 2021 poll by the Washington Post, a whopping 72% of U.S. internet users said they trusted Facebook “not much” or “not at all” to handle their data responsibly. (Those sentiments help explain why Facebook’s parent company recently rebranded itself “Meta Platforms,” an evasion I try to avoid reinforcing.) Even Apple and Amazon, which performed best out of the companies in the survey, were distrusted by 40% of respondents.  There’s another index of privacy fears that is particularly emblematic of our era: the rise of conspiracy theories about digital surveillance. Tsukuyama of the EFF says she frequently talks to people certain that their smartphones or other devices are actively listening to their conversations and then delivering ads based on that spying. Tsukuyama and other third-party experts say that’s not true – but just because you’re paranoid, it doesn’t mean they’re not after you.  “Your phone’s not listening to you,” Tsukuyama says. “But what’s scary is that [companies] don’t have to listen. They can infer who you’re hanging out with, time of day, if you’re looking for stuff, your age, all these kinds of things, from your search history.  “They don’t need to listen to you – they just know anyway.”  Betting on the ‘techlash’  The EFF, ACLU and other organizations and activists have continued the hard democratic work of enshrining stronger privacy into law. But over the past few months, these fears have also bloomed into something Americans tend to be more enthusiastic about than major legal reform: a money-making pitch. This one is christened Web 3.  Web 3 is still ill-defined, capable of standing for almost any fantasy of the digital future. But a foundational pillar is the idea that blockchain-backed assets and decentralized data systems can help users regain control from big platforms like Facebook or YouTube.  It’s still unclear exactly how that might work, and figures like Twitter founder and Block CEO Jack Dorsey have alleged “Web 3” is just a hollow catch phrase promoted by venture capitalists. But however vague, the promises have generated a flood of media coverage and seized the attention of techies.  Even before Web 3, investment in privacy technology was rising steadily. According to Crunchbase, venture capital investments in “privacy and security” startups more than quintupled between 2011 and 2019, from $1.7 to $9.9 billion.  Those numbers exclude blockchain and crypto projects, but money is flowing into them, too - witness the recent $400 million infusion to the privacy-focused Secret Network. Crunchbase lists 207 privacy startups with $3.5 billion in funding raised, and an average founding date of October 2015. That makes them much younger than the average social media startup, founded in April 2009.  And there are strong signs of genuine user interest in privacy-oriented digital products and features.  DuckDuckGo, the search engine whose primary pitch is that it doesn’t track users, now reportedly has larger market share on mobile than Microsoft’s Bing (a low bar, but still). Interest in the decentralized and open-source social media network Mastodon has grown steadily in recent years, though actual user numbers are hard to come by.  Perhaps most notably, encrypted messaging apps Telegram and Signal grew dramatically in 2021.  Will financial surveillance face a reckoning?  Rising anxiety about data tracking may portend a similar shift on an issue more obviously relevant to blockchain and crypto projects: financial privacy.  Some “fintech” startups have helped to erode people’s financial privacy (I’m looking at you, Venmo). But the federal government has also been a major culprit, dating back at least to new international banking rules after 9/11.  And the Biden administration has accelerated the financial monitoring agenda to Ludicrous Speed.  In the summer of 2021, for instance, we saw a clumsy attempt to broaden reporting requirements for crypto wallet transactions, which generated such controversy that it briefly threatened Biden’s first big spending bill. That provision was rumored to have been promoted behind the scenes by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.  Yellen’s Treasury Department was behind an even more extreme proposal, which would have granted the Internal Revenue Service the right to monitor individual bank accounts with more than $600 in transfers per year. The universal surveillance measure was rationalized as a way to increase tax revenue, despite the fact that the wealthiest 1% of Americans are responsible for a vastly disproportionate share of missing revenue (and are unlikely to use personal U.S. bank accounts to hide their wealth). The provision’s threshold was raised to $10,000 in the face of pushback from Republicans and banks and was then ultimately withdrawn.  To its credit, the Biden administration did drop a sweeping proposal from its predecessor that would have required crypto exchanges to verify the identities behind crypto wallets their customers transacted with. Still, Yellen’s recurring case of legislative foot-in-mouth disease betrays a strange and disturbing openness to testing the boundaries of the right to privacy enshrined in the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Similar impulses have gone even further outside the U.S., as with India’s campaign to eradicate cash and China’s heavily surveilled “digital yuan.”  These top-down efforts to reduce the freedom to transact could end with the same kind of backlash to mainstream finance that has permanently tarred Facebook. It is tempting to argue that this is already underway – that the huge inflow of capital to cryptocurrency over the past two years was driven by real anxiety over rising financial controls.  But we all know that interpretation would be self-indulgent. While still potentially enhancing privacy for informed users, crypto has become largely unmoored from one of its clearest real applications, eroded by wave after wave of speculative manias in which rising numbers are all that really matter. Whether some of those speculators will pick up actual insights about data privacy as they throw a quadruple-leveraged long on Floki Inu Coin is, at best, uncertain.  Prospects for federal privacy regulation  There is a broader problem with focusing on products and services that enhance privacy, whether we’re talking about cryptocurrency or a OnePassword subscription: Not everyone can afford them. Even as anxiety over privacy continues to rise, a purely market-based approach would likely create a world in which your access to privacy depends on your ability to pay for it.  “That’s why we’re very much in favor of federal privacy legislation,” said Samir Jain, policy director for the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) “That legislation should have protections that don’t involve paying money, but are basic rights applying to everyone … regardless of your ability to pay.”  The prospects for privacy legislation at the federal level are surprisingly bright, according to Jain, especially given the partisan dysfunction that has reigned in Washington for going on two decades. “It’s a rare topic where there is a lot of bipartisan agreement,” he said. “There are Republican and Democratic proposals.”  At the state level, California, Colorado, and Virginia have enacted broad privacy regulations, some modeled on Europe’s data protection act, GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). The appearance of a patchwork of state laws can sometimes make federal regulation nearly inevitable, as the regulated companies themselves eventually start wishing for simple uniformity. Unfortunately, according to many experts, companies often aim to subvert the process by proposing intentionally toothless legislation.  But there are models for effective federal regulation. At the minimum, good laws would limit what data companies can collect and retain to what they need for their operations and give the public the right to review data gathered about them. But there are more radical provisions on the table.  One of the most important would close a major loophole in data available to the federal government. There are, at least in theory, strict limits on the government’s freedom to surveil its citizens. The protections against “unreasonable search and seizure” in the Fourth Amendment were expanded and clarified by a 1967 Supreme Court case to include electronic communications. The Privacy Act of 1974, passed partly in response to abuses by the Central Intelligence Agency during its campaign of terror against the civil rights movement, further narrowed what the U.S. government can do with data about citizens.  “But the data brokers keep dossiers on everybody, and the government has contracts with the data brokers,” the ACLU’s Stanley said. “So it’s a complete end run around privacy protections.”  This end run is possible because of what’s known as the “third-party doctrine,” a U.S. legal standard according to which citizens can claim “no reasonable expectation of privacy” regarding any data voluntarily turned over to a third party. That includes banks, internet service providers, social media companies or effectively any other nongovernmental entity. One effect of the doctrine is that government agencies have the right to freely buy data about citizens that they would be prohibited from gathering directly without a court-issued warrant.  This nightmarish loophole has led to a variety of abuses, such as police departments buying license plate camera surveillance data from private firms. In April, a large and bipartisan group of U.S. senators introduced “The Fourth Amendment Is Not For Sale Act,” a bill to close the loophole.  That’s a genuine bright spot, and there’s more where that came from.  “I think American legislators are pregnant with privacy regulations,” Stanley said. “It’s not clear when they’ll give birth or what those will look like.”  Targeting targeted ads  But the truly nuclear solution to privacy is unlikely to ever catch on with Congress: banning targeted advertising.  “Advertising is what makes data worth money,” as Stanley succinctly puts it, what ultimately motivates much of the data gathering by private companies. It’s why Facebook prioritizes outrage over more positive feelings and why Instagram pummels teen girls with alluring but psychically toxic imagery. But a legal ban on programmatic advertising, or even heavy regulation of it, is extremely unlikely to gain traction in the U.S., the home of the world’s biggest data monetizers.  That brings us back to Web 3 – not the fantastical VC fable of infinite non-fungible token widgets, but a simpler and more grounded vision that merely integrates cheaper, automated, customizable payments into Web-based services.  In a best-case scenario, that would enable a much broader set of business models, instead of making so much of the web dependent on advertising – and, in turn, user data. It’s one scenario for the eventual decline of data hoarding as a business model.  However events unfold, Stanley said the rise of digital surveillance is a fast-moving “land grab” based on the ability of innovation to outpace regulation. If history is any lesson, norms and regulations will eventually catch up to this early wave of digital privacy looters.  “We saw this in the 18th century, even in Europe,” he says. “It was common for the monarchies to be reading everyone’s mail, and there was a lot of pushback on that. Over the decades and centuries, nearly every European country stopped doing that.”  “It can be very slow moving,” Stanley concluded. “But there’s a long arc towards privacy.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,David Z.

The new DeFi features include staking, liquidity pools, yield farming, and permissionless lending and borrowing. Additionally, users will be able to swap thousands of cryptocurrencies on multiple blockchains including assets on Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum, and Fantom ecosystems. Since the start of 2020, the DeFi ecosystem has soared exponentially in value as developers introduced new ways for users to make their capital work. In 2021, the industry further blossomed as Layer 1 scalability solutions such as Solana and Layer 2 solutions including Polygon, Fantom, and Avalanche were built on Etherum, reducing the gas costs and transaction times greatly. According to DeFi Pulse data, the total locked value (TVL) DeFi ecosystem has grown from $10.5 billion in January 2020 to a high of $112 billion in November 2021, representing almost 10X growth during the period. One of the leading applications of DeFi supporting the gargantuan growth is the rise of automated market makers, or AMMs. They allow investors and token holders to use their tokens to provide liquidity, earn returns and concurrently increase demand for the native token exchange.

Preserving the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency, improving cross-border payments and increasing financial inclusion are all seen as benefits of a U.S. digital currency, analysts led by Alkesh Shah, wrote in the note Monday. The Fed published a discussion paper last week on the benefits and risks of a U.S. CBDC.  Potential risks – which could be diminished by CBDC design choices – include “changing the financial sector’s market structure by shifting deposits, increasing the liquidity risk of the financial system if deposits at commercial banks were converted to a CBDC and decreasing the efficacy of monetary policy implementation,” the note said.  Bank of America said key considerations before issuing a CBDC are the need for it to be privacy-protected, intermediated, transferable and identity-verified.  Stablecoins are likely to see an increase in usage in the absence of CBDCs, the bank noted, adding that the two largest by market value, tether and USD coin, had a combined market value of around $121 billion as of Jan. 21. Their use as a means of payment is increasing, particularly for cross-border remittances, the report said, as they are faster and cheaper than using fiat currency.  In a report published earlier in the month, Bank of America challenged the Bank of England’s assertion that a U.K. CBDC would act just as a form of digital cash. It said CBDCs are likely to replace checking accounts as the way in which consumers hold the majority of their funds.

In order to successfully reach its aims, Fuse, therefore, depends on a quick and relatively low-fee blockchain and so the Layer-1 EVM compatible Fuse Network is utilized alongside the mobile-centric infrastructure for the purposes of consumers and businesses alike. In such a fast-paced and unpredictable sector, this kind of technology is often needed. Why pick Sushi? Sushi is one of the top cross-chain decentralized finance protocols and platforms in the entire world and it is hence highly sought after by all kinds of projects. SushiSwap, the AMM (Automated Market Maker) DEX protocol, the BentoBox decentralized applications ecosystem, the staking platform xSUSHI, the Kashi lending protocol, the Miso IDO platform, and the Shyu NFT marketplace all comprise the leading multi-chain community-oriented decentralized finance platform.

Trademark applications containing yuan yuzhou - Mandarin for metaverse - have been denied registration by the National Intellectual Property Administration, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported Monday citing data from business and trademark registration tracking firm Tianyancha.  Those rejected include applications by NetEase, iQiyi and Xiaohongshu.  Applications by the country's tech giants including Tencent and Alibaba (which owns the SCMP) are still pending review.  The action has been attributed to an attempt to combat a rush of such applications which could cause trademark squatting – a situation where someone other than the original brand owner obtains a trademark – and misunderstanding among consumers.  According to experts, this suggests that authorities are attempting to assuage any potential hype around the metaverse in the technology industry.  “What I see is the government encouraging enterprises to enter the metaverse arena with genuine technological capability,” Chen Gaojie of tech research firm PatSnap, told the SCMP. “The metaverse involves many core cutting-edge technologies, such as artificial intelligence and blockchain.”  The metaverse is a conceptualized world where the internet eventually becomes an immersive virtual space that can be used for work, play, socializing, experiences and events.

42390152,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bUu7q3,1643036429,Bitcoin Isn’t Private – But Its Recent Taproot Upgrade Will Help,"Bitcoin is somewhat private – at least for users who know what they're doing. But most people don't.  The network's transaction data is fully public for anyone to view. Most people using Bitcoin might not realize that, because of the unique way Bitcoin works, their financial history is being recorded indelibly in a ledger that anyone in the world can pull up on their computer with ease.  If Bitcoin users aren't careful, their transaction history could potentially be exposed to the world. Not to mention, analytics companies like Chainalysis are dedicated to unearthing detailed information about where bitcoin is being sent and who owns which transactions.  Behind the scenes, developers are crafting privacy updates in the hopes that users of Bitcoin can use the currency privately – without the extra thought or effort.  This article is part of CoinDesk's Privacy Week series.  The wide-reaching upgrade Taproot, which activated in November, brings a variety of improvements to the table. One important piece is boosting privacy.  Taproot doesn't fully solve Bitcoin's privacy issues. But as we'll see, it does pave the way for some substantial improvements.  Read More: Why Bitcoin’s Taproot Upgrade Matters  Disguising complex transactions  In Bitcoin now, most transactions are simple: Just send bitcoin from one person’s wallet address to another. But there are also more complex transactions with more complex rules, such as multisignature transactions, which require two or more people to sign off on a transaction in order for it to go through.  Then there's the Lightning Network, a way to send faster and more scalable payments on Bitcoin, which is needed because Bitcoin's on-chain capacity is limited. Opening and closing a Lightning channel creates a unique-looking transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain.  At present, each of these complex types of transactions looks a little bit different from ""normal"" transactions. In Bitcoin's completely public ledger, there are little technical details built into each transaction that make it possible to tell if someone made a multisignature transaction or a Lightning transaction.  That's where Taproot comes in. The privacy upgrade makes it possible to make more complex transactions exactly like normal transactions. All of these different transactions will look exactly the same.  ""By obfuscating the true nature of the transaction, it makes it possible for those smart contract transactions to hide amongst the 'regular' ones,"" as Bitcoin mining company Braiins puts it.  Hiding Lightning transactions in the crowd  Lightning builds on top of multisignature transactions. To send bitcoin over the Lightning Network, a user needs to open a Lightning ""channel."" Once they do, they can make as many transactions as they would like off-chain – potentially thousands – without touching the main Bitcoin blockchain. This process helps Bitcoin scale because there's limited on-chain capacity.  In this way, Lightning already boosts Bitcoin's privacy because, unlike with on-chain transactions, none of the individual transactions between the opening transaction and the closing transaction are stored directly on the Bitcoin blockchain.  But for now, each Lightning opening channel is a detectable on-chain transaction, which looks different from normal, simple transactions. Similarly, the final transaction a user makes when they want to close their channel shows up as a distinctly different type of transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain.  Taproot hides these transactions from plain view. With Taproot, any transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain could conceivably be a Lightning open or close. But no one could possibly know for sure, thanks to Taproot's cryptography.  ""So we'll get into nice situation that many random [transactions] out there 'could have been' [Lightning Network] channels which actually transport coins off-chain, hugely boosting privacy even for people who don't use [Lightning Network],"" as Bitcoin privacy expert Chris Belcher tweeted in 2020, a year before Taproot activated.  PTLCs: Disconnecting Lightning bounces  As we described above, Taproot Lightning transactions can be hidden on-chain.  But some off-chain entities can still see the payments. The Lightning Network is, as the name suggests, a network, composed of thousands of ""routing nodes"" connected together that help to ""route"" payments to their destination. Each Lightning payment bounces from one routing node to the next through channels, until it reaches the recipient.  Each of these routing nodes can see a little bit about each payment that they route. Some of the information about the payment is already shielded to a degree – like where the payment came from.  Currently, these payments are secured with so-called ""Hash Time Locked Contracts (HTLCs),"" smart contracts that ensure that the routing nodes in a payment's path cannot steal a user's payment (though they can receive a small fee for each payment that they route).  With HTLCs, routing nodes can see the preimage. Because this preimage data is the same across all bounces in the payment path, it's possible for spying routing nodes to figure out where a payment came from. Say a spy owns two routing nodes which detect two payments with the same preimage. Using that information, it can potentially guess the payment's senders and receivers.  Taproot opens the door to a HTLC replacement: Point Time Lock Contracts (PTLCs). PTLCs offer a way to undermine this kind of spying. Because each ""payment point"" looks different, unlike every HTLC preimage, it's less easy to correlate each bounce in a payment route. As such, PTLCs offer better Lightning Network privacy.  Better Bitcoin privacy still requires patience  The bad news is that these types of indistinguishable transactions won't suddenly be possible now that Taproot is activated, however. It's exciting that Taproot transactions are now finally possible, but there's still plenty of work to do. Most wallets allowing users to send and receive bitcoin transactions still need to upgrade their software to support Taproot.  Read more: After Taproot, What’s Next for Bitcoin’s Future?  And for Lightning transactions in particular, each Lightning software implementation needs to add support for the new transaction type. Then, wallets do as well. This will take some time.  Similarly, PTLCs aren't a change that will be possible straight away. As with Taproot hiding complex transactions, there's still a lot of development to be done to support PTLCs in each Lightning implementation.  Not to mention, Taproot has one privacy problem in the short term: Taproot transactions look different from the transaction types that came before it. So far, only less than 1% of Bitcoin transactions support Taproot. So, Taproot transactions themselves stand out from the rest of the transactions.  Still, if SegWit, Bitcoin's previous upgrade, is any indication, the Taproot adoption will grow to become the standard over time.  Taproot has finally activated after years of development, meaning a massive hurdle has been crossed in the path to these shiny privacy improvements.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/01/24/bitcoin-isnt-private-but-its-recent-taproot-upgrade-will-help,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/18d149ad29deb0e940b70b9fae28eac5a86cd26b-5262x3508.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411842,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgaYL,1643034446,Hard Fork vs. Soft Fork,"Forks, or the threat of them, seem to be an established feature of the cryptocurrency landscape. But what are they? Why are they such a big deal? And what is the difference between a hard fork and a soft fork?  A “fork,” in programming terms, is an open-source code modification. Usually, the forked code is similar to the original, but with important modifications, and the two “prongs” comfortably co-exist. Sometimes a fork is used to test a process, but with cryptocurrencies, it is more often used to implement a fundamental change or to create a new asset with similar (but not equal) characteristics as the original.  Not all forks are intentional. With a widely distributed open-source codebase, a fork can happen accidentally when not all nodes are replicating the same information. Usually, these types of accidental forks are identified and resolved. A majority of cryptocurrency forks occur due to disagreements over embedded characteristics, as we'll explore below.  One thing to bear in mind with forks is that they have a “shared history.” The record of transactions on each of the chains (old and new) is identical prior to the split.  Hard forks  There are two main types of programming fork:  Hard fork.  Soft fork.  A hard fork is a change to a blockchain protocol that renders older versions invalid. If older versions continue running, they will end up with a different protocol and with different data than the newer version. This can lead to significant confusion and possible errors.  With bitcoin, a hard fork would be necessary to change defining parameters such as the block size, the mining difficulty algorithm, limits to additional information that can be added, etc. A change to any of these rules would cause blocks to be accepted by the new protocol but rejected by older versions and could lead to serious problems – possibly even a loss of funds.  For instance, if the block size limit were to be increased from 1MB to 4MB, a 2MB block would be accepted by nodes running the new version, but rejected by nodes running the older version.  Let’s say that this 2MB block is validated by an updated node and added to the blockchain. What if the next block is validated by a node running an older version of the protocol? It will try to add its block to the blockchain, but it will detect that the latest block is not valid. So, it will ignore that block and attach its new validation to the previous one.  Suddenly you have two blockchains, one with both older and newer version blocks, and another with only older version blocks. Which chain grows faster will depend on which nodes get the next blocks validated, and there could end up being additional splits. It is feasible that the two (or more) chains could grow in parallel indefinitely.  This is a hard fork, and it’s potentially messy. It’s also risky, as it’s possible that bitcoins spent in a new block could then be spent again on an old block (since merchants, wallets and users running the previous code would not detect the spending on the new code, which they deem invalid).  The only solution is for one branch to be abandoned in favor of the other, which involves some miners losing out (the transactions themselves would not be lost, they’d just be re-allocated). Or, all nodes would need to switch to the newer version at the same time, which is difficult to achieve in a decentralized, widely spread system.  Or, bitcoin splits, which has happened (hello, bitcoin cash).  Soft fork  A soft fork is essentially the opposite of a hard fork, whereby newly implemented changes remain backward-compatible with older versions.  For example, if a protocol is changed in such a way that tightens the rules, implements a cosmetic change or adds a function that does not affect the blockchain's structure in any way, then new version blocks will be accepted by old version nodes. Not the other way around, though: the newer, “tighter” version would reject old version blocks.  In bitcoin, old-version miners would realize their blocks were getting rejected and would be forced to upgrade. As more miners upgrade to the latest version, the chain with predominantly new blocks becomes the longest, which, in turn, increases the amount of orphan old version blocks that are created and causes more miners to upgrade. This process ensures the system self-corrects. Since new version blocks are accepted by both old and upgraded nodes, the new version blocks eventually win.  For instance, say the community decided to reduce the block size to 0.5MB from its current theoretical limit of 4MB (with SegWit blocks.) New version nodes would reject blocks with the old limit and would build on the previous block (if it was mined with an updated version of the code), which would cause a temporary fork.  This is a soft fork, and it’s already happened several times. Initially, Bitcoin didn’t have a block size limit. Introducing the limit of 1MB was done through a soft fork since the new rule was “stricter” than the old one.  The pay-to-script-hash function, which enhances the code without changing the structure, was also successfully added through a soft fork. This type of amendment generally requires only the majority of miners to upgrade, which makes it more feasible and less disruptive.  Soft forks do not carry the double-spend risk that plagues hard forks, since merchants and users running old nodes will read both new and old version blocks.  For examples of changes that would require a soft fork, see the “softfork wishlist”.",NEUTRAL,없음,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | FORKS,Noelle Acheson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/hard-fork-vs-soft-fork,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fc0272a210a0b0718a6529555b0c2fb7729ffa72-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42390148,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bUu7af,1643032905,Chelsea Manning on the Sad State of Online Privacy,"Chelsea Manning warned us.  Over four years ago, the whistleblower penned an op-ed for The New York Times titled, “This Is the Dystopia You Signed Up For,” observing that “virtually everything we do causes us to bleed digital information, putting us at the mercy of invisible algorithms that threaten to consume our freedom.”  Did people listen? Yes and no.  “Privacy has been in a weird spot lately,” Manning told me on a recent Zoom call. She sounded almost exasperated by society’s indifference to privacy. Many of us heard the warnings, read stories about data abuse … and simply shrugged.  This article is part of CoinDesk's Privacy Week series.  “The individual's assertion towards their own privacy has been culturally beaten out of them,” Manning said. She says the average person now thinks, “I’m just going to hand over everything and sign over everything, and then, if I feel like I'm violated, I'll complain about it. But until I'm aware of it, I'm going to be oblivious.”  Calling that mindset a “major problem,” Manning is trying to fix it. Or, more accurately, if she can’t fix the attitude itself – she’s a realist and knows it’s a “cultural problem” – she can try to improve the infrastructure.  Taking on this problem started in prison. While serving her sentence for leaking documents to WikiLeaks’ founder, Julian Assange (a sentence later commuted by U.S. President Barack Obama), Manning began hatching a plan, using pen and paper, for a blockchain-enabled way to protect online privacy. That work led her to work at Nym, a blockchain startup, whose stated mission is to “establish privacy as a default for online communications” by building it into the internet’s infrastructure. In August, she started as a security consultant for Nym; now she’s joining full time.  She views the work as urgent, necessary and even critical to our well-being.  “The lack of privacy has health impacts on people. I really believe this,” Manning said. “Once you start to no longer have any privacy, and you've essentially become a prisoner to this sort of tech dystopia, your health and your physical and mental health will deteriorate.”  So for the sake of your own health, here’s Chelsea Manning on the current state of online privacy, why all of us are at risk of being “commodified” and how she manages the paradox of being a celebrity who craves privacy. (Wearing masks during a pandemic helps.)  This interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  Society's relationship with privacy  What do you see as the main risks, downsides and consequences of people sort of “giving up” on online privacy?  I think the biggest risk is that people become so commodified. Everything becomes a microtransaction. I see this on Twitch, for instance, where the main ways that you engage with people are through microtransactions. You have to purchase emotes [Twitch’s emoticons] if you want to send people emotes. That's a microtransaction. You can gift people subscriptions. So as things and people become more and more commodified in this way, they're becoming more alienated in their daily life. This is one of the reasons why people are feeling less and less fulfilled as they engage more and more with the electronic world.  What’s your biggest concern right now?  It's the TikTok-ization of the world. Every single second that you're on TikTok, every single interaction that you have is measured down to the microsecond. That's how the algorithm gets fed. You're bombarded with information constantly, and you’re measured on how you interact with that content, at every microsecond. That is a major, major concern that I have. Everything becomes an interaction down to the microsecond.  Would you say this problem has gotten better or worse in the last few years?  It's gotten worse. It’s gotten worse mostly due to people having given up on their privacy. Or they've assumed that they're protected by law somehow, when they're not.  It does seem like there was a moment, with the backlash against tech companies, where people seemed more concerned.  Yeah, I think people are concerned. I think people are educated and understand this. But I also think that people have mostly decided that ""oh, somebody is going to fix this” or “I'm sure somebody's looking into that,” when the opposite is the case. Nobody is really focused on this. For me, it's cultural. The biggest concern I have in the privacy realm is that people know they're being tracked, they know they're being surveilled and they're just like, ""Well, what can I do, really?"" And I think that's a cultural issue.  What are some ways the internet needs to change in order to better respect privacy and to fix this problem?  It's infrastructure. You have to build privacy into the infrastructure. I've been saying this for years. We need to build those privacy mechanisms into [the infrastructure] of those big ad-revenue generating companies – like the whole concept of nudging, where you're essentially trying to nudge people to make sure that the [privacy settings] are clicked. We need to implement that.  Do you mean an opt-in for privacy? Can you elaborate a bit?  From an engineering perspective, security needs to be built in at the infrastructure level. You need to encrypt the stuff at the hardware level. You need to encrypt everything automatically. You need to have everything checked ahead of time.  I'm not so much an Apple fan as I am an Apple crypto-security fan, as iPhones are pretty opt-in. They opt you in first and all of the security stuff is turned on. It’s very robust, and it’s all hardware-level. I think that the iPhone is a very good example of a piece of technology that takes this approach of built-in privacy. And moving into the 2030s and 2040s, we need to start looking at new infrastructure standards, where we are essentially Tor-ifying everything by default.  Privacy and public policy  How about at a policy level? What do you want to see happen?  I have zero hope for stuff at a policy level. This is a cultural issue; I don’t think this is a legal thing because the regulatory infrastructure, everywhere, has been gutted. GDPR [Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation] was a leapfrog, and it really solidified a lot of stuff, but it has been slowly chipped away by Silicon Valley.  How would you grade the Biden administration, so far, on its approach to tackling the issue of privacy?  Nonexistent. Where have they been? I'm not aware of the Biden administration taking solid positions anywhere. It's very striking. What I find striking about the Biden administration is the sheer silence on a lot of topics. You know, I'm aware of lobbying ongoing, and I’m aware of statements the Biden administration has made, but I haven’t seen a lot.  Improving blockchain privacy  Let’s talk about your work at Nym. What do you see as the overall mission?  Well, the slogan is, “Privacy for everyone.” Privacy for everyone by default. This is me speaking, not Nym, but we cannot depend on people to demand their own privacy. We have to sell privacy to people. I’m learning this myself. We have to tell people, ""Privacy is good. You want it.” We have to sell privacy to people – just like VPNs, because [virtual private networks] have done a good job of making themselves salable to people, and I think that's good.  Good point. It’s almost like the VPN commercials have weaponized fear, right?  Yes.  What else can you say about your goals for the Nym infrastructure?  I want the Nym infrastructure to be made as efficient and as fast and as seamless and as integrated as possible.  Transactions on the network need to happen faster, and they need to happen as synchronically as possible. It’s a hard sell, but it also lines up with the realm of the rest of blockchain and cryptocurrency, because if we can speed up transaction speeds on the network that will speed up transaction speeds at a hardware level. I'm hoping that Nym can solve the proof-of-stake transaction calculation problem at the hardware efficiency level. I think that these are large-scale issues. I think that they're tackleable issues.  Can you talk about why that matters?  One of my criticisms of cryptocurrency is the fact that we're essentially commodifying tokens and things for systems that are just using gigawatts every second. These calculations are very inefficient. These ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) are optimized for speed, but they're not optimized for energy efficiency. With the Nym network being a much cheaper network to maintain, we can focus on speed. And we can focus on power efficiency. And we can focus on decentralization.  While we may not be investing in the hardware itself, we can certainly set standards and protocols for having things on the network be as energy efficient as possible, to be as quick as possible. We can tell people, “Hey, here's a security thing, but it's also seamless.” It feels like any other tool that you use. It doesn't feel wonky. It doesn’t feel weird, it doesn't feel like a plug-in, it doesn't feel like you have to learn an entire new language in order to use it.  The life of Chelsea Manning  Last question: It almost seems like you’re now forced to live with a paradox in that you are a fierce advocate for privacy but you are also a very famous person. How do you grapple with that?  It doesn't click in my brain. It just doesn't register. It’s like I don’t understand it. I go to the pharmacy and people come up to me and they're, like, ""Hey, I know you."" And I'm wearing a mask. We're in a pandemic. I don’t feel as famous as I am, but I have to concede that I am probably permanently famous. It's hard, because I do care about privacy. I think I've found a balance, where I have the luxury of sort of blending in. It's not the same as it is for the average person. [Most] people can blend in by default and I have to seek it.  What are your tricks for blending in? Not to dox you, but how do you pull it off?  I just act normal. I just go do my normal stuff, but whenever we started to unmask a little bit, I was like, ""Oh, yeah. That's right. I forgot."" Some things are just never going to be the same. I’m not going to be able to walk down the street in lower Manhattan without being hassled for a selfie. It's just not going to happen. But I've been able to find this balance, and I feel okay with it.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/01/24/chelsea-manning-on-the-sad-state-of-online-privacy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/974d1ae6fc957010904f133617b284582e44e2f1-3600x2400.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42423831,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2hB5h,1643032800,Luxor Starts Ethereum Mining Pool as Proof-of-Stake Shift Looms,"Luxor, the crypto software and services company, is launching an Ethereum mining pool even as the cryptocurrency is currently planning to abolish mining from its network.  The company is working with large institutional miners, including Hut 8, and several retail miners in North America to provide a U.S.-based Ethereum mining pool, the company said in a statement on Monday.  “The mining pool is outfitted for Miner Extractable Value, a novel mining strategy for maximizing Ethereum transaction value, and is optimized for a low uncle rate (mined blocks that aren’t added to the longest blockchain history but which miners get paid for all the same),"" Luxor said. The pool will also be compatible with its Catalyst service, which enables miners to get paid in bitcoin for their validation on Ethereum network.  'Most robust'  Luxor is launching the mining pool service amid efforts to switch Ethereum to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus model from its current proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism, which will eliminate the need for miners. That transition has been delayed multiple times.  However, Luxor is not worried about the PoS switch.  “We've been tracking ETH 2.0 developments closely, and we're launching the pool even now because we believe there's a high probability that Ethereum's transition to proof-of-stake won't happen this year,” Luxor Mining’s co-founder and Chief Operating Officer Ethan Vera told CoinDesk.  Luxor has also started organizing and building an advocacy group to keep Ethereum on PoW consensus in addition to launching the pool. ""At Luxor, we believe that proof-of-work is the most robust and tested consensus mechanism for public blockchains, and that includes Ethereum,” Vera added.  In recent months, the PoW consensus mechanism has received scrutiny by lawmakers globally for its energy consumption. Most recently, the U.S. held a congressional hearing to discuss the energy consumption related to the PoW. Meanwhile, the EU markets regulator called for a ban on the validation system, citing its energy intensity.  However, Luxor sees the system as the best way to ensure the network's security, decentralization and incentivization of more green-energy transition.  “At Luxor we believe the proof-of-work consensus mechanism is optimized for decentralization and security, while green-energy innovation is moving us to a world in which PoW mining will not be an environmental concern,” Vera said.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | MINING,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/01/24/luxor-starts-ethereum-mining-pool-as-proof-of-stake-shift-looms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a25bd65dd7f6fc9dc92563aece25dcf72942430c-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

6868,http://blokt.com/?p=33002,1643031652,How to Short Bitcoin – A Simple Guide [2022],"When Bitcoin made its dramatic decline in 2018 from all-time highs, many traders may have wished that they could profit from the thousands of dollars that were wiped off Bitcoin’s market cap and spot price. Well, it may surprise you to learn that many traders did – and they still are in 2022. Trading a derivative of Bitcoin allows traders to profit from both positive and negative price movements in the market, but how is this possible, and how can you get started? Find out in our how to short Bitcoin in 2022 guide, where we’re going to break down the fundamental concepts behind ‘shorting’ the market. Shorting Bitcoin So, you’ve decided you want to open a short position on Bitcoin. How would you do this? The first step is to identify and sign-up for a cryptocurrency derivatives platform. We’re going to review some of the best ones below. For this, you’ll need to have some Bitcoin ready to deposit to the exchange. There’s plenty of options to buy BTC with fiat, such as USD or EUR. We review the best ways to buy Bitcoin in 2022 here , so make sure you’re ready to deposit before you start. Once you’ve got some BTC, open a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange account and deposit your Bitcoin. Unlike traditional exchanges, most crypto derivatives exchanges don’t require KYC or identity verification, so you can start trading in minutes. Top Exchanges for Shorting Bitcoin in 2022 As the cryptocurrency markets have matured, the number of derivatives exchanges launched to meet demand has increased, and there are now plenty of trusted options available for traders looking to short Bitcoin. Let’s look at some of the top trading platforms: Rank Exchange Deposit Methods Fiat Accepted Cryptocurrency Supported HQ 1 FTX ( Full Review ) BTC, ETH, Stable coins None BTC, ETH, LTC,BCH Hong Kong 2 BitMEX [Full Review] Crypto None BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH, EOS, XRP, ADA, TRX Hong Kong FTX.com FTX.com is one of the most advanced trading platforms for shorting Bitcoin. Established in 2019, FTX.com has quickly become one of the most popular crypto derivatives exchanges in the world. Built by the quantitative trading team of blockchain professional services firm Alameda Research, FTX.com has been developed from the ground up and offers advanced trading with low fees. Traders can use FTX.com to short Bitcoin with up to 100x leverage, with options contracts for Bitcoin and a range of other top cryptocurrencies. Another innovative feature of FTX.com that we haven’t seen implemented on other exchange platforms is their ‘BULL & BEAR’ leveraged tokens. These are ERC20 tokens that represent either a long or short position in an underlying asset, including Bitcoin, and it’s an incredibly quick and easy way to take a position in the market. FTX has a tiered fee structure for traders. At tier 1, taker fees are 0.07%, and this is reduced to 0.04% at the highest tier – which can be achieved by holding FTX tokens. There are no fees on futures settlements. Deposits on FTX.com are made in Bitcoin. Overall, FTX.com is a great option for opening Bitcoin shorts. You can read our complete guide on FTX exchange here . BitMEX BitMEX Homepage One of the longest-serving and most trusted Bitcoin trading platforms, BitMEX is a peer-to-peer trading platform for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and a handful of other cryptocurrencies. BitMEX was established in 2014 and has consistently remained as one of the top-volume crypto derivatives exchanges in the world since its launch. There are a number of Bitcoin options contracts available on BitMEX, which allow traders to open long or short positions. Traders can utilize up to 100x leverage on BitMEX, which boosts your position size when opening a trade. There’s also an insurance fund that prevents traders from getting liquidated unfairly in the event of high volatility. BitMEX’s fees are 0.075% for takers regardless of their leverage. They charge 0.01% on long funding trades, and -0.01% on short funding, with funding intervals of 8 hours. There is a 0.05% settlement fee on traditional Bitcoin futures. Deposits on BitMEX are made in Bitcoin, which uses the ticker symbol ‘XBT’ for the purposes of BitMEX’s futures contracts. BitMEX is one of the most well-respected Bitcoin trading platforms, and we highly recommend it for opening a short position on Bitcoin. You can read our full BitMEX review here . Huobi Global Huobi Global is a trusted and long-serving exchange from Singapore. Huobi Global is a Singaporean spot and derivatives exchange launched in 2013. It’s one of the highest volume exchanges in the world and has long been a favorite among East Asian cryptocurrency traders. There are multiple derivatives and options contracts available for Bitcoin on Huobi Global, which include weekly, bi-weekly, and quarterly futures – which refers to the point at which the contract expires. Huobi offers greater leverage than some of its competitors, with up to 125x on its bi-quarterly futures contracts, which let traders open short positions on Bitcoin. You can deposit BTC and a range of other cryptos on Huobi for opening short positions. Huobi has an interest rate on margin of 0.098% and a 0.04% taker fee on Bitcoin futures contracts. As one of the safest and most frequently used sites in the world, Huobi Global is a great choice for opening a Bitcoin short position. Find out more about Huobi Global in our complete guide here . What is Shorting? When you buy an asset or a derivative of an asset with the intention of profiting from the asset going up in price, you are said to be ‘going long’. On the other hand, a trade placed with a view to profit from an asset’s decline in price is called ‘going short’ or ‘shorting’ the market. While it’s typical to buy an asset at spot price and physically hold it to open a long position, it’s not as simple to open a short. This is because you’ll need to sell Bitcoin in order to repurchase it at a lower price. For this, you’ll need to use a Bitcoin derivatives exchange, and trade a futures or options contract. Traditional Market Some of the options for shorting Bitcoin in crypto trading are known as ‘naked shorts’ – meaning you don’t have to own the asset before you sell or short it. However, for most crypto derivatives exchanges, you will need to deposit some Bitcoin to the platform before you can open a short. Short sells can often be opened with leverage, which is the act of borrowing against your original capital in order to increase your position size. This can magnify gains, but also increase losses. You can read more about that here . We’ll explore some of the most popular crypto derivatives exchanges below, but first let’s look at some of the pros and cons of shorting Bitcoin. Benefits of Shorting Bitcoin There are a few benefits of shorting Bitcoin, mainly for short-term traders but long-term holders may also want to consider opening a short. These benefits include: More opportunities for profit – If the market turns bearish, you can open a short position to profit from the downward movement. In the short-term, this means you don’t have to be left holding a bag of BTC in a bear market. Portfolio diversity – If you’re bullish on the blockchain industry as a whole, but not Bitcoin, then shorting Bitcoin can be a great way to maximize profits from alt-runs while also profiting from a decline in BTC price. Derivatives over ownership – This can be a pro or a con depending on how you look at it. When you short Bitcoin, you’re trading a derivative. This means you don’t own the underlying asset, and so positions are sometimes easier to close or open, and you don’t have to worry about Bitcoin custody. Bitcoin / USD derivatives illustration – Source: shutterstock.com Negatives of Shorting Bitcoin While shorting opens up possibilities to profit from periods of Bitcoin price decline, there are a few considerations you should know before opening a position: Effect on the market – If you’re bullish on Bitcoin overall, but you want to profit from short-term bearish action, then you should consider that the number of short positions open influences the overall trading sentiment on Bitcoin as a whole. Risk of liquidation – Trading platforms that allow traders to short the market also offer options for leverage. Trading with leverage allows you to borrow against your initial funds and trade with a much larger position. However, the risk for losing funds is also greatly magnified and you should keep this in mind while trading. Fees – When you short, you’re essentially borrowing money from the exchange in order to place a trade. Unlike buying Bitcoin at ‘spot’ price where the asset belongs to you, when shorting you don’t own the underlying Bitcoin. As a result, you must pay fees – such as ‘overnight funding’ – on your position. This makes it unsuitable for long-term holds. Volatility – Just as the market moves quickly into a bearish phase, it can move quickly back into a bullish trajectory. Only open a short if you’re sure the price of Bitcoin has a significant degree of downside potential. Bitcoin Trading Key Things to Remember When Shorting BTC Hopefully, this guide will have helped you decide if shorting Bitcoin is right for you, and help you choose a trading platform on which to open a short.

The bug, which was discovered as early as Dec. 31, 2021, allowed the attackers to buy NFTs at older, lower prices, and sell them for a hefty profit. Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic wrote in a blog post that one attacker called jpegdegenlove ""paid a total of $133,000 for seven NFTs – before quickly selling them on for $934,000 in ether. Five hours later, this ether was sent through Tornado Cash, a 'mixing' service that is used to prevent blockchain tracing of funds.""  NFTs are digital assets on a blockchain that represent ownership of virtual or physical items. OpenSea is one of the largest marketplaces for NFTs.  Elliptic estimates the market value of the affected NFTs to be over $1 million.  Jpegdegenlove partially reimbursed two of the victims, sending them back a total of $75,000 on Monday, Elliptic said.  Some users have been transferring their listed assets to other wallets to take them off the market place whilst avoiding the delisting fee, founder of NFT project freshdrops_io tweeted back in December.  But even though the item may appear to be off the OpenSea front end, it is still accessible on OpenSea APIs and Rarible, another NFT marketplace.  CoinDesk could not reach OpenSea for comment on this story.  One NFT from the popular Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) collection was listed under its July 2021 price of 23 ether, and the attacker was able to sell it for 135 ether, making a quick profit of more than 100 ether, tweeted Tal Be'ery, Chief Technology Officer of ZenGo crypto wallet.  Asked about the bug, an OpenSea Discord admin confirmed to CoinDesk that ""if you had an open listing that you never cancelled, or didn't hit its expiration, it still exists.""  ""The thief had a bot to scan the blockchain for pending transactions that had low floor pending and bought them,"" Joe Vargas, an influencer who also runs his own NFT project, told CoinDesk.  Bored Ape Yacht Club, Mutant Ape Yacht Club, CyberKongz and Cool Cats NFTs have been affected.  One collector, who saw their BAYC sell for 0.77 ether, went on Twitter to express his shock when he realized his NFT had disappeared.

This goes back to the crypto winter at the end of 2017 and early 2018, where the market was in a consolidation phase for almost 2 years. At that time, BTC crashed from around $20,000 to below $4,000 the next year causing many investors to lose interest in digital assets. In a recent note to clients led by analyst James Malcolm, the UBS banker warned that cryptocurrencies could lose their appeal among investors this year. To begin with, the analysts explained that the Federal Reserve&apos;s interest rate hikes could result in investors moving away from Bitcoin (BTC), which is seen as a good store of value. The report noted that government stimulus was a key factor boosting the prices of cryptocurrencies in 2020 and 2021. The hike in interest by the Central Bank is bound to come if inflation continues to surge. The analysts noted that if central banks get a grip on inflation control, investors may not be holding bitcoin as protection against rising prices. The Fed is expected to raise interest rates several times this year. In fact, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon recently said that the Federal Reserve will have to raise short-term interest rates more than four times this year. Similarly, Goldman Sachs too expects that the central bank could raise interest rates four times this year.

42417088,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcRwes9,1643030088,Buying Bitcoin Anonymously (More or Less),"Want to buy some bitcoin? Better get your ID and front-facing camera ready.  These days, the price of entry into cryptocurrency is usually not just your dollars or euros but also a wealth of personal data. The practice of gathering such data from users, known as know-your-customer, or KYC, has been increasingly adopted by major cryptocurrency platforms as regulators across the world grow concerned about the use of crypto by criminals. (Of course, bad actors still find ways to sneak in, as a recent CoinDesk investigation found.)  On the other hand, some people prefer to minimize sharing sensitive data about themselves, even if they are not involved in any criminal activities. One reason for that can be concerns about their personal data potentially getting stolen or leaked in a hack, like the one that happened to Binance, a top crypto exchange, in 2019.  This article is part of CoinDesk's Privacy Week series.  And some crypto users are just maintaining an old-school cypherpunk mentality, believing that in cyberspace, their real-world identity is nobody’s business.  “Privacy is important for a truly free and sovereign society,” said Lili Rhodes, senior mining analyst at U.S. bitcoin mining company Compass Mining, in a Twitter direct message to CoinDesk.  “Satoshi and the cypherpunks advocated for P2P [peer-to-peer] networks and technology. KYC #bitcoin was never the vision,” Rhodes argued in a recent Twitter thread.  Luckily for the privacy-minded, there are still ways to acquire bitcoin and other cryptos without doxxing yourself, several of which Rhodes described in her thread. CoinDesk looked into some options, which are described below.  This list is by no means exhaustive. Different methods have their pros and cons, which require careful consideration. So, if you decide to try any yourself, as they say, do your own research.  Remember that nothing on the internet is completely anonymous, so make sure you understand and manage the risks.  Face-to-face and bitcoin ATMs  Buying crypto in a real-world meetup is one of the oldest options on the market since the original cryptocurrency’s inception. Around 2014-2015, people would trade BTC in person at the Satoshi Square gatherings, named after Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator. You might hand someone a wad of cash and they would scan a QR code from your phone for a Bitcoin address to send the BTC. (One New York trader would throw in a t-shirt.) These meetups took place around the world, from Austin to Kyiv.  The tradition seems to have faded in recent years, but you still can find Satoshi Square-like events in some places, such as Stockholmhttps://www.meetup.com/stockholm-satoshi-square/events/qsszqsydccbwb/, Sweden, or Bangkok, Thailand. If you want the thrill of this old-school method, try to find meetups in your area on crypto forums like Bitcointalk or event boards like Meetup.com.  However, with in-person cash trades, due to their informal character, there is no way to guarantee the other party will deliver their part of the deal (i.e., your bitcoin), unless you sign some kind of agreement (which might defeat the purpose of the whole thing by exposing your personal information) or buy from someone you trust (and the person might want to know and trust you, too).  Another way to buy bitcoin in the physical world for paper cash, which also has caveats, is to use a bitcoin ATM – a machine you might find in places like pharmacies, convenience stores and grocery stores.  However, over the years, bitcoin ATMs also became subject to regulations in some parts of the world, so if you choose this method you need to figure out if the ATMs available require ID verification to make a purchase or if they have other possible limitations.  Read More:Government Report Suggests Tightening Regulations on Crypto ATMs  For example, Genesis Coin ATMs in San Antonio, Texas, allow you to buy $20 to $500 worth of bitcoin using only your phone number. But if you want to buy more than that, you need an ID, according to the Coin ATM Radar website.  On the other side of the globe, the Kurant ATM network in Austria allows you to purchase up to EUR 250 ($286) worth of bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin or dash without ID verification, according to Coin ATM Radar.  There are plenty of websites monitoring the geography of bitcoin ATMs, like Coin ATM Finder or Bitcoin ATM Map. In any case, things can change over time both in the virtual and physical worlds, so it’s ultimately up to you to find the location and check if the ATM is still there, working and maintaining the same rules regarding KYC – or lack thereof.  For example, for my hometown of Moscow, both Coin ATM Finder and CoinATM Radar showed several ATMs by RusBit, located in grocery stores around the city center. Bitcoin ATM Map did not list them. No information was available regarding rules or limitations, so I went to check those machines myself.  In two of the listed locations, the ATMs were working and did not require ID to use. But in the third location, the grocery store that used to host the ATM was closed, so the machine was not available either. (The Bank of Russia's recent call to ban cryptocurrency use may endanger such kiosks, whether they require KYC or not.)  Bottom line, real-world purchasing methods require some free time and an adventurous mood.  Non-custodial P2P exchanges  There is a limited number of P2P marketplaces where users make deals directly with each other, rather than having bids and offers matched by an automated engine, as happens on big, centralized exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. In other words, the P2P experience is more like Craigslist than Nasdaq.  Among those P2P exchanges, a small subset does not require KYC and does not take custody of users’ funds.  To ensure both parties complete their part of the trade, P2P platforms like HodlHodl and LocalCryptos use smart contracts that lock bitcoin inside a multisignature wallet until the deal is complete, and release it to the buyer once the seller confirms a payment was made. LocalCrypto also offers markets in ether, bitcoin cash, litecoin and dash, while HodlHodl is bitcoin-only.  The fiat part of the deal happens outside of the platform and is totally up to buyers to take care of. Sellers may accept various payment methods, which they list in their ads, ranging from bank wire transfers to other cryptocurrencies and even in-person arrangements.  When two users decide to make a deal and agree on the payment details in a chat, the seller locks crypto in a multisignature escrow wallet. When the buyer sends a payment, the seller checks it and releases bitcoin from the escrow to the buyer’s wallet.  When there is a dispute and one user says the other one did not deliver their part of the deal (send fiat or release bitcoin), users can ask the platform to act as a referee. The buyer might provide proof of payment to show they held up their end of the bargain.  In the case of HodlHodl, the platform controls one of three keys to the multisignature escrow where bitcoin is stored for the duration of the deal. For each deal, the escrow is generated anew, with a set of three private keys: one controlled by the buyer, another one by the seller and the third one by the HodlHodl administrator.  To complete the deal, two out of three keys are needed, so if the buyer and a seller cannot agree, the platform uses its key to release bitcoin to whatever party it considers to be in the right, HodlHodl explains on its website. The project says it does not work with U.S. residents and asks new users to confirm they’re not U.S. residents before they can start using the website.  LocalCryptos describes a similar system for resolving disputes between users. One party can give an arbitrator a key to unlock funds in escrow and another to decrypt messages with the other party. Then the arbitrator can study the evidence and release funds to the party it considers right, the website says.  However, LocalCryptos does not provide detailed explanations of how the bitcoin escrow works or what happens when a dispute is resolved by the arbitrator.  CoinDesk reached out to LocalCryptos’ official Twitter account but did not hear from the team by press time. The website does not provide any contact information for the team.  Decentralized exchange  Another non-custodial exchange using multisignature escrows is the decentralized marketplace Bisq. Like HodlHodl or LocalCryptos, it’s non-custodial, but the main difference is that Bisq does not have a web interface – its website only serves as a place where people can download the Bisq software and then run it on their own computers. This is probably the most decentralized option out there.  You also need to have some bitcoin already to start trading: You lock it as a security deposit to guarantee you won’t defraud your counterparty. The security deposit can be used to penalize users for violating trading rules, Bisq’s website says.  The arbitration of disputes is especially interesting on Bisq, as the marketplace is run by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), an entity that, at least in theory, has no leader. The Bisq DAO launched in April 2019, and since then, the platform has no longer been able to resolve disputes by releasing funds from escrow with its own key.  What’s left, then? If a buyer and a seller cannot resolve a dispute among themselves, they call a mediator, who must be approved by the DAO and lock some governance tokens, BSQ, as a guarantee they will judge cases fairly. (A mediator who misbehaves will forfeit their pledged BSQ.) Users are obliged to engage with the mediator by the trading rules. The mediator suggests a solution but cannot enforce it.  If users do not agree with the mediator’s solution, there is a last resort, which “is meant to be rare,” the Bisq dispute resolution rules say: arbitration. If the dispute escalates to arbitration, the disputed bitcoins in the multisig escrow are sent to the Bisq donation address.  That bitcoin is then used to buy the governance token, BSQ, on the market and burn it, supporting the value of the token. “This reduces BSQ supply, allowing for new BSQ to be issued as reimbursement for deserving traders through arbitration with minimal impact on BSQ supply.”  How? If you convince an arbitrator you’re right, “they will personally reimburse you,” Bisq’s dispute resolution page says. Arbitrators, in turn, are reimbursed by the Bisq DAO.  ""If the arbitrator is convinced, they pay the user BTC out of their own pocket (then at some point afterward, the arbitrator requests BSQ from the DAO to be reimbursed for their BTC payment to the user),” said one of Bisq’s code contributors who asked not to be named.  However, if the disputed amount exceeds 0.5 BTC, users must ask the Bisq DAO directly to make them whole. “Because, as you might imagine, arbitrators would prefer to avoid making such large out-of-pocket outlays of BTC,” the contributor said. “In these cases, users are paid in BSQ, which they can then sell for BTC on Bisq.""  As you can see, Bisq might be tricky to understand and use for people who don’t have some experience and knowledge of crypto, so it’s no surprise markets for some fiat currencies are a bit thin at the moment.  For example, on Jan. 19, I found zero offers to buy or sell bitcoin for the Russian ruble, zero offers for the Nigerian naira and one offer for the Iraqi dinar.  Read more: The Future for Unregulated Bitcoin Exchanges  Apps, vouchers and more  Some mobile crypto wallet apps also allow you to buy crypto with only your banking information and no further verification. Two examples are U.S-registered TrusteeWallet and Swiss Relai.  Relai works only for people with European bank accounts because to start trading, you need to provide your IBAN number, which is a bank account identifier only EU banks use. TrusteeWallet requires your bank card information and does not mention any geographical restrictions in its policies.  Similar to bitcoin ATMs, Azte.co, which has offices in Santa Monica, California, and London, sells bitcoin vouchers via a network of vendors scattered across the globe. To buy a voucher, you need to find the nearest vendor on the Azte.co website, which might be a store, cafe or other business that partnered with the firm. Vouchers are sold and printed on the spot by cashiers. To redeem bitcoin, you need to enter your voucher code and your wallet address on the website.  Most of Azte.co’s 2,125 vendors are concentrated in the U.K. and Europe, though there are locations scattered throughout the U.S., Canada, Mexico, South Korea and Kenya, according to the website.  There are more exotic ways to buy bitcoin, some of them easier than others. Eric Wall, chief investment officer of the crypto fund Arcane Assets, described his experiments buying bitcoin anonymously in a very instructive blog post in March 2020.  Among other methods, Wall mentioned buying bitcoin with gift cards from, say, Amazon or multiple other companies – offers like that can be found on custodial peer-to-peer marketplaces, such as LocalBitcoins or Paxful, or the non-custodial platforms mentioned above. Keep in mind that custodial platforms like LocalBitcoins and Paxful still require KYC to start trading, even though the sellers might not know your identity.  Wall notes that some offers on custodial marketplaces provide sellers’ contact information, so you can interact with them outside of the platform, which would essentially be more like a cash deal with a stranger from the internet.  But probably the most exotic way Wall tried out himself, successfully he said, was buying Old School Runescape gold, an asset in a 9-year-old online role-playing game. Players trade Runescape gold on the game’s forum for fiat and crypto.  In short, Wall was able to buy some (imaginary) gold from another player for a PayPal transfer, then sell it to someone else for bitcoin – but the full story is much more elaborate and entertaining.  Read more: Inside London's First Bitcoin Voucher Shop  Assessing risk  Like anything in crypto (or life), buying coins without ID is all about trade-offs.  Face-to-face cash deals are by design more anonymous. However, there might be a higher risk of fraud.  On the other hand, online deals, when you pay your counterparty electronically, may have some safeguards established by the marketplace protocol, but your counterparty or the platform itself might see your payment details, which makes it less anonymous.  Another thing to keep in mind is that at this point in the crypto industry’s evolution, not all bitcoins are considered equal by everyone.  Some coins would be accepted by any exchange or vendor, but some might be blacklisted and blocked once they reach a regulated centralized exchange, such as Coinbase or Binance. This usually happens when the crypto can be traced back to known darknet marketplaces, ransomware proceeds or other criminal sources.  Whether you care about this or believe that all bitcoins are created equal, in-person cash deals provide a limited opportunity, if any, to check if the bitcoin you’re buying might be considered “tainted” by some of the major players in the crypto market.  On the other hand, marketplaces like HodlHodl and LocalCryptos allow you to see the address of your seller before making a purchase, after the funds are locked in escrow.  At this point, you can use some of the blockchain analytics tools available to retail users and check how risky your bitcoin would be considered by major crypto exchanges that use blockchain tracing tools.

42407255,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gULTHw,1643029209,Introducing CoinDesk’s Privacy Week,"Cryptocurrency was supposed to be about privacy. It’s right there in the prefix ""crypto"" (meaning “hidden” or “secret”), a label the technology shares with cryptography, the discipline that spawned it.  “We have to trust [banks] with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts,” Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto wrote in 2009, explaining the impetus to create a new, peer-to-peer monetary system.  Yet 13 years later, while BTC and its knockoffs and descendants have become a $2 trillion asset class, privacy remains hard to come by, both for cryptocurrency users and everyday people.  Corporations and governments continue to collect mountains of personal data, often without the subjects’ knowledge or consent. This sensitive information is often guarded poorly (one word: Equifax) or abused (two words: Wells Fargo) or both.  Far from fulfilling the dreams of the cypherpunk movement that inspired Satoshi, cryptocurrency has arguably created a new panopticon on top of the old one. To buy or sell digital assets, most consumers have to identify themselves to regulated online exchanges, which sometimes ask for more information, such as selfies and biometrics, than traditional banks do. While public blockchains obscure users’ real-world identities, an industry of on-chain sleuths has sprung up to connect the dots, aiding law enforcement but undermining the pseudonymity Satoshi’s design relied on.  But all is not lost.  Privacy progress  From Bitcoin’s Taproot upgrade to alternative privacy coins to innovations like mixers and zero-knowledge proofs, various communities are working to restore crypto’s original, namesake promise – even as international regulators demand the collection and sharing of ever-more data.  Outside of cryptocurrency, activists are fighting to claw back long-lost privacy for internet users broadly, whether through sophisticated tech tools, legal reforms or some combination.  Coinciding with international Data Privacy Week, CoinDesk’s Privacy Week series is a collection of articles that explore this battleground from a range of perspectives – technological, regulatory and cultural.  We survey the state of play for digital and financial privacy in 2022, in crypto and beyond, and where it might be headed in the years and decades to come. It's the fourth ""theme week"" from Layer 2, CoinDesk's magazine of ideas; check out our previous collections, Policy Week, Future of Money Week and Culture Week.  We hope you enjoy the mix of features, opinion and research.

42423835,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2hBDh,1643028807,Solana Slides 17% to Lead Losses Amid Crypto Market Plunge,"Major cryptocurrencies fell as much as 17% in 24 hours as the crypto market followed a broader decline in U.S. stock index futures on Monday. Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, fell to under $33,700 at the time of writing after trading above $34,000 in Asian morning hours.  Solana's SOL token was down 17%, changing hands at $84.17, data from analytics tool CoinGecko showed. SOL was among the top performers in 2021, rising from $3 at the start of last year to over $259 in November. It's down 67% from its all-time high, and 42% lower than last Monday.  Similar losses were seen on ether and the tokens of Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT) and Binance Coin (BNB), which fell nearly 10% each in the past 24 hours. DOGE, the token of Dogecoin, fell 7% in the same period, among the smallest declines of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.  Monday’s drop caused a plunge in the broader crypto market and over $240 million in liquidations since Asian morning hours, data from analytics tool Coinglass showed. Liquidations refer to the forced closure of long or short positions by exchanges due to margin shortage. These lead to exaggerated price moves, as has been seen several times over the past 12 months.  Liquidations on bitcoin futures, which reached their lowest price levels since July 24, exceeded $63 million at the time of writing. This was exceeded by ether futures, with over $64 million in liquidation losses. Losses on altcoin futures were smaller, with SOL futures seeing $5 million in liquidations and XRP futures just $2.15 million.  Nearly 81% of all traders were long, or betting on higher prices, as some technical indicators suggested bitcoin was oversold and a price rally could be expected.  Meanwhile, some analysts said the market could see a further drop.  “Alarmingly, the sharp reversal on Friday was not followed by any meaningful bounce,"" said Alex Kuptsikevich, senior financial analyst at FxPro, in an email to CoinDesk. ""Some observers point out that this is a worrying signal, suggesting further market declines, as we have not seen a final capitulation. Without capitulation, the markets will remain with an overhang of sellers.”  “Events are developing in a bearish scenario, so far broadly repeating what we saw in 2018 in terms of overall sentiment,” Kuptsikevich said.",NEGATIVE,SOL,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/24/solana-slides-17-to-lead-losses-amid-crypto-market-plunge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4dd883fa67bebc6cef0f51065c3921afdd8bced5-1500x1004.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The EVM&apos;s job is to add a few new features to the Blockchain so that consumers have fewer problems with the distributed ledger. Every Ethereum node runs on the EVM to maintain consensus across the blockchain. Ethereum facilitates something called smart contracts, a piece of code running on Ethereum. EVM is completely isolated, meaning the code inside the EVM has no access to the network, file system, or other processes. Ethereum has two types of accounts: Externally Owned Accounts (EOA) and Contract Accounts, both of which are treated equally under the EVM. EVM facilitates the execution of smart contracts (solidity) on any machine (OS agnostic). EVM is an intermediary layer between a smart contract and the operating system installed on the machine (operating system). EVM can read and execute Solidity code once compiled to bytecode. The JVM (Java Virtual Machine) might help you comprehend things better if you&apos;re a programmer. If we don&apos;t have EVM, we&apos;ll have to create compilers for each operating system separately. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) makes the Ethereum ecosystem more efficient and compatible.

Last week and into Saturday (January 22), the shocking drop that has been a hallmark of digital assets in recent weeks continued to play out, with Bitcoin losing more than 15 percent at one point. The largest digital token has lost more than half of its value since its previous high, and many other cryptocurrencies have lost just as much, if not more. Superlatives abound when it comes to the carnage: Friday&apos;s drop resulted in the liquidation of more than $1.1 billion in crypto futures holdings, and more than $1 trillion in market value has been lost since the last peak.

Bitcoin fell to $33,600, its lowest level since July 24, even as technical indicators signaled oversold conditions.  The leading cryptocurrency has declined 27% this month and is struggling to find a price floor with whales or large investors staying on the sidelines.  Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, slid 10% to $2,270, the lowest since July 28, according to CoinDesk data. The native token of Ethereum's blockchain has lost 38% this month.  Ether could soon see a bitcoin-like death cross, a bearish cross of the 50- and 200-day moving averages. Bitcoin has dropped over $10,000 since confirmation of the negative crossover earlier this month.  Other prominent coins like Solana' SOL, Cardano's ADA and Polkadot's DOT fell 12% to 15%.  The latest sell-off comes after Goldman Sachs predicted a faster pace of Fed tightening if inflation continues to rise. The heightened geopolitical tensions between U.S. and Russia could be adding to bearish pressures around risk assets, in general.  “We see a risk that the [Federal Open Market Committee] will want to take some tightening action at every meeting until the inflation picture changes,” Goldman economist David Mericle said in a note to clients on Saturday, according to CNBC.  The investment bank has penciled in four quarter-percentage-point rate hikes for this year. Fed fund futures are priced for nearly five rate increases.  Most commentators have tipped the first increase in borrowing rates in March followed by three more at subsequent quarterly meetings.  The ultra-hawkish expectations perhaps leave the door open for a relief rally if the central bank disappoints market expectations later this week by sticking to its December projection of three rate hikes in 2022.  The Fed’s January policy meeting is due to start on Tuesday and the statement and interest rate projections will be published on Wednesday at 19:00 UTC.

Therefore, the fallout of $28 seems imminent. Arweave is an open-source storage network that aims to provide an unending platform for the preservation of files.

Let us move ahead to read about Arweave technical analysis. Past Performance of AR The AR coin price shows a correction phase in action with a downfall of more than 50% in the past month. The downfall results in the fallout of the long-standing support zone at $35. The price shows a short-retracement that retests the fallout of $35.

DeFi broadly refers to smart contract-based financial services such as trading, lending and borrowing offered by blockchain projects to users.  As of Monday morning in Europe, more than $12.2 billion worth of Fantom’s FTM and other tokens were locked on 129 protocols geared toward Fantom users. That's just over $94 million locked per project on average, and it's a 52% increase in the past week and a greater than 170% increase over the past month, the data showed.  Cross-chain swap Multichain is the biggest protocol by value locked on Fantom, with over $6.97 billion worth of assets in its smart contracts. In second place is the relatively new 0xDAO, which locks over $3.91 billion, while decentralized exchange SpookySwap takes third place with just over $1 billion in locked value.  BSC slipped to the fourth-largest DeFi ecosystem with $11.96 billion in locked value over 294 projects. Terra, which displaced BSC in December to become the second-largest DeFi ecosystem, retains second place with $16.54 billion in locked value. Ethereum retains the DeFi crown with over $116 billion in locked value over 415 projects, more than any other blockchain.  Tokens of Fantom have emerged as the top performers in recent months as investors bet on the tokens of layer 1 projects – protocols with their native blockchains, such as Fantom or Solana – as an alternate to Ethereum.

42375480,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw84y5,1643013934,Bitcoin Whales Stay Away Even as Technical Indicator Flashes Oversold,"While bitcoin's (BTC) price slide appears overdone on technical charts, demand from whales, or large crypto investors, remains elusive, signaling a low probability of a quick trend reversal higher.  The cryptocurrency's 14-day relative strength index (RSI), a popular momentum indicator, has dipped under 30, supposedly hitting lifetime lows and representing oversold conditions.  An under-30 RSI reading means the market has fallen too fast, and bears may now take a breather, leaving the market rangebound. Bitcoin traded in a sideways manner above $30,000 for several weeks following the previous oversold reading registered on May 20, 2021.  ""Daily RSI at all-time lows doesn't mean that bitcoin has bottomed out. In our opinion, a good consolidation phase is required to build confidence for investors to re-enter the markets,"" Lennard Neo, head of research at Stack Funds, told CoinDesk in a WhatsApp chat.  According to Jeetesh Tipe, founder and CIO at Mumbai-based crypto asset management firm MintingM, the weekly chart RSI is nearing 35, a level that has marked price bottoms in the past.  That said, the RSI, just like other technical studies, isn't reliable as a solitary indicator and can stay oversold or overbought for a prolonged period.  ""Think of building a house; a builder is reliant on a hammer, but as an isolated tool, the hammer is worthless when building an entire house. Other tools will be needed in conjunction with the hammer for construction – saw, drill, etc.,"" analysts at DailyFX noted in an explainer article. ""The same concept relates to overbought/oversold signals which require complementary tools to strengthen the signal, and eventually allow traders to make sound trade decisions.""  Crypto traders often read overbought/oversold RSI readings with blockchain metrics like whale demand, derivatives market data and macro factors.  As of writing, there were no signs of renewed buying by large investors, with supply held by entities owning at least 1,000 BTC stagnant, having decoupled from rising prices in late September.  ""Still a lack of large buyers, or what we refer to as 'whales' on-chain. This looks at entities with over 1,000 BTC and then filters out exchanges,"" William Clemente, the author of the Blockware Intelligence newsletter, said in the latest weekly edition published Friday.  The late September divergence between whale holdings and rising prices was perhaps an advance indicator of a crash observed over two months. We saw a similar divergence heading into the May 2021 crash.  Options market activity continues to lean bearish. According to Swiss-based derivatives data tracking platform Laevitas, several multi-leg strategies betting on a continued downside crossed the tape over the weekend.  Lastly, persistent fears of earlier than expected and faster interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and U.S- Russia tensions may push the safe haven dollar higher and keep bitcoin bulls at bay.  ""Right now, fears from macro uncertainties such as inflation and geo-political tensions have overflowed into crypto markets. The added strong correlation between both asset classes continues to pressure bitcoin's price downwards. Hence, we could expect RSI to continue remaining low with more choppiness for price action in the near term,"" Stack Funds' Neo said.  At press time, bitcoin was changing hands near $35,000, down 3.7% on the day. The cryptocurrency has almost halved since hitting record highs near $69,000 on Nov. 10, CoinDesk data shows.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/24/bitcoin-whales-stay-away-even-as-technical-indicator-flashes-oversold,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d04621123f5b417f3e9976b5b04b4268929edc46-2476x1374.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375468,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw84ml,1643008739,"Cosmos Token Surges 8% Amid Airdrops, Polkadot Bridge","ATOM, the token of blockchain Cosmos, rose as much as 8% in the past 24 hours as investors bet on further upside for the high-speed blockchain, making the token among the few gainers on Monday morning.  ATOM rose to $35.22 during early Asian hours from Sunday’s lows of $28. The prices saw resistance at those levels and tumbled to $32 at the time of writing. ATOM prices reached an all-time high of $45 last week but have since fallen 25% alongside a drop in the broader crypto market.  Strong fundamentals factors supporting the price surge are the upcoming airdrops to Cosmos stakers and a bridge implementation between Cosmos and Polkadot. Bridges are tools that connect and transfer data between two blockchains.  Tokens of protocols built on Cosmos that were previously airdropped to stakers, were among the biggest gainers on Monday morning even as the broader crypto market saw nominal losses. Tokens of Juno Network (JUNO), Stargaze (STAR), and Comdex (CMDX) – DeFi-centric tokens built on Cosmos – rose as much as 6% in the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko.  DeFi, short for decentralized finance, refers to financial services such as trading, lending, and borrowing that rely on smart contracts instead of third parties.  The airdrops are part of a planned process for Cosmos stakers. Cosmos, as a proof-of-stake blockchain, relies on validators that provide computing sources by locking up ATOM in nodes to maintain the network and process transactions, in return for token rewards.  Projects built on Cosmos provide additional yields to users. Native projects automatically airdrop tokens to Cosmos stakers based on their the total amount staked, resulting in further value accrual for ATOM holders.  Meanwhile, some analysts say the upcoming launch of EVMOS has increased interest for Cosmos among investors. “Cosmos has been the talk of the town lately with the impending EVMOS launch this month also driving attention. EVMOS (previously Ethermint) will allow EVM-compatible applications to integrate into the Cosmos ecosystem,” analysts from crypto research firm Delphi Digital wrote in a note last week.",POSITIVE,ATOM,ATOM | BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/24/cosmos-token-surges-8-amid-airdrops-polkadot-bridge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a063e08977bbaf8eb8898e042c8a7734f4b6576a-1813x830.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Dependent on them, the people of the world suffer, slowly watching their financial opportunities vanish. If individuals are to determine their own financial futures - and thus their lives - power must be decentralized and returned to them. Failures of Fintech and Traditional Finance In a panic to uphold their economies, world governments printed tens of trillions of dollars during the COVID-19 pandemic, consequently diluting the buying power of citizens globally. Now, inflation is on the rise - 6.8% in the United States, 4.48% in India, and 3.8% in the UK. World governments have made it very clear that they can print as much money as they like, regardless of the cost. People are tired of their fates being dependent on the state&apos;s policies - money printing, bank bailouts, trade wars, and business subsidies - policies that rob them of financial opportunities. Fintech does as much to reduce access to financial services as it does to increase it. Inhumane automated systems determine insurance rates, big players on Wall Street manipulate the markets, financial institutions harvest people for their data, and governments take a piece of every dollar that citizens earn before they&apos;re even paid.

42375476,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw84wp,1642997997,"First Mover Asia: Bitcoin, Ether Regain Ground Sunday After Early Weekend Battering","Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Market moves: Bitcoin was trading at over $36,000 on Sunday after continuing its recent decline earlier in the weekend.  Technician's take: BTC is stabilizing on intraday charts, although $30,000 is a more significant level to watch given the decline in long-term momentum.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $36,202 +3.4%  Ether (ETH): $2,532 +5.4%  Top gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Cosmos ATOM +3.4% Smart Contract Platform`  Top losers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Internet Computer ICP −9.2% Computing Litecoin LTC −9.2% Currency Filecoin FIL −9.0% Computing`  Sector classifications are provided via the Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS), developed by CoinDesk Indices to provide a reliable, comprehensive, and standardized classification system for digital assets. The CoinDesk 20 is a ranking of the largest digital assets by volume on trusted exchanges.  Markets  S&P 500: 4,397 -1.8%  DJIA: 34,265 -1.3%  Nasdaq: 13,768 -2.7%  Gold: 1,834 -0.2%  Market moves  Bitcoin capped a forgettable three days, dipping below $34,400 at the start of the weekend, before mounting a small comeback on Sunday.  At the time of publication, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading well above $36,000, a nearly 3.4% gain over the previous 24 hours but well off its all-time high near $69,000 set in early November. Trading volume was light with many investors continuing to assess troubling economic conditions and a pronounced decline in equities markets.  The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 2.7% on Friday as investors continued to veer away from stocks that led recent years' charge in stocks. Two other major indexes, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 fell 1.3% and 1.8%, respectively. The market slump has stemmed from widespread concerns about interest rates, supply chain inefficiency and the ongoing coronavirus, which has been gathering strength in many parts of the U.S. even as it wanes in others.  Ether dipped below $2,400 on Saturday before returning to a base camp above that level, where spent the remainder of the weekend. At the time of publication, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was trading above $2,500, an almost 5.5% rise. Most of the major altcoins spent Sunday in the red.  ""The market is holding its breath as investors look to the opening of the Asian markets for a sign of what equities will do this week,"" Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of crypto fund BitBull Capital, told CoinDesk. ""If Asian markets open strong, we can expect demand for crypto to go up, and even more so if the U.S. markets have a strong Monday.  DiPasquale added that ""crypto is still finding its way as to whether it is a digital gold-like hedge that moves inversely with equities, or whether it's a risk-on asset that will fail if equities continue to fail on Monday as many equity indexes did on Friday. While those most bullish on the investment case for crypto cite longer-term data that point to bitcoin not being correlated with other asset classes, data over the last two years has shown a correlation in the price of bitcoin and equities.""  Technician's take  Bitcoin Sell-Off Deepens Below $40K; Minor Support Nearby  Bitcoin (BTC) failed to hold short-term support at $40,000 as sellers maintained the two-month long downtrend.  Intraday oversold signals were not enough to sustain bids, which means longer-term indicators are more reliable to determine bitcoin’s price direction.  BTC was trading around $36,200 at press time and is down 17% over the past week.  The slowdown in upside momentum on monthly and weekly charts has been a persistent theme since December. As the long-term uptrend weakens, sellers typically outweigh buyers despite occasional oversold signals.  Further, when drawdowns (percent decline from peak to trough) become severe, short-term traders tend to reduce their position sizes and tighten trade parameters around intraday support and resistance zones.  Bitcoin is roughly 40% below its all-time high of $69,000, which is a significant drawdown. The previous drawdown extreme was in July when BTC settled near $28,000 after falling roughly 50% from its peak.  For now, initial support is around $35,000-$37,000, which could stabilize the current sell-off. The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is the most oversold since May 19, which preceded two months of sideways trading before a rebound occurred.  If selling pressure accelerates this week, BTC could find stronger support around $30,000.
