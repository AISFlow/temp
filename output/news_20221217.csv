In that same timeframe, the coin declined by close to 9%. The depreciation in value might continue as the technical outlook points in the same direction. With the recent Solana Protocol Raydium hack of over $2 million, the price of the coin has been affected further. Over the past week, the coin has shed nearly 10% of its value. As SOL fell from its long-standing support line of $13, the coin has been on a freefall. Demand for the altcoin has remained substantially low, with investor interest fading away. Investors have to be cautious as SOL continues to depict increased volatility over the past few weeks. For the bulls to return to the market, there are two important price levels that Solana has to breach. Trading volume in SOL declined, which is noted in the case of bearish price action. As volatility remains high, a further push from the sellers will push SOL below its immediate support line. The market capitalization of SOL depreciated, an indication that the coin is under bearish influence. Related Reading: Bitcoin Plummets Below $17,000 After Audit Firm Mazars Pauses Work For Binance Solana Price Analysis: One-Day Chart SOL was auctioning at $12.26 at the time of writing. The Solana price broke off its consolidation when it fell below the $13 support line. For the bulls to be back, Solana has to turn the $13 price level into a support line again. Before doing that, the coin has to move past the $12.50 price mark. As the coin continues to register less demand, a further fall in value is on the chart. In that case, Solana will begin bidding at $11, then at $10.40. This will mean another 17% fall for the coin before it starts to note a price reversal. The amount of Solana traded in the last session declined, and that was a sign of bearishness on that chart. Technical Analysis Over the last few weeks, the altcoin was trying to capture buyers, but the price did not align with the bulls. The Relative Strength Index was below the 40-mark, close to the oversold and undervalued region. Usually, after this phenomenon, the coin attempts to reverse its value. In relation to buyers, the Solana price was below the 20-Simple Moving Average line, depicting slow demand for the altcoin. It meant that the bears were driving the price momentum in the market. According to the depiction of volatility, the technical indicators have sided with the idea of an explosive price action. The Bollinger Bands, which indicate price fluctuation and volatility, narrowed and were constricted, indicating that SOL was expecting a breakout. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence depicts price momentum and change. The indicator painted a red signal bar, which was tied to the sell signal for Solana price.

That's 2.5x higher than the amount of tokens listed in 2020 that ended up failing, aka ""dead coins,"" and 3.5x higher than the year-to-date figure, Julia Ng, who leads Growth Marketing at CoinGecko, wrote in a recent study . ""During this period, many cryptocurrency projects, tokens and coins with little to no value or any immediate or discernible purpose were launched by various anonymous developers,"" Ng pointed out. ""Few were actually committed to their projects, which resulted in a high rate of failure, and thus their ultimate demise."" The global crypto market cap stood at only $866.4B after peaking at around $3T in November 2021, according to CoinMarketCap data . The sharp decline in the value of cryptos in a short period of time doesn't necessarily reflect any fundamental or structural change to the blockchain ecosystem took effect, just as the stock market's performance doesn't always reflect the health of the economy. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), which is seen as a key gauge for the cryptoverse and broader risk tolerance, changed hands at $17.8K as of Wednesday afternoon, down substantially from its November 2021 all-time high of $68.9K. That's a more than 70% peak-to-trough drop. Many major tokens mirrored BTC's volatile path as seen in this chart . Based on CoinGecko's methodology, cryptos may be taken off the site due to a shortage in trading activity within the last two months. A token might also get removed if projects are revealed to be a scam, or if projects request to be deactivated. ""Excluding the anomaly year of 2021, an average of 947 cryptocurrencies listed are dead and end up failing in the last five years, between 2018 to 2022,"" Ng noted. Tony Saliba, CEO of crypto trading technology provider Liquid Mercury, cited previous crypto market cycles where an outsized number of projects launched tokens that ended up failing after a frenzy-fueled bull run. ""This pattern played out during the last cycle when many projects rode the tailwind of a strong bull market in 2017, creating the ICO-driven surge in altcoins, and many of these tokens dropped to zero in 2018 and 2019 when the prices of bitcoin, ether, etc. fell,"" he told Seeking Alpha in an emailed statement. ""You need to have substance behind a product, a team that knows how to run a business, and more just to have a fighting chance as a startup, so the ebb and flow of token listings during market cycles will very likely persist into the future."" Seeking Alpha contributor Anna Sokolidu flagged bitcoin as ""highly volatile and unpredictable,"" recommending conservative investors to look elsewhere in 2023. On the flip side, see why fellow SA contributor The Digital trend thinks Cathie Wood's $1M bitcoin prediction ""might be right.""",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/news/3917207-almost-40-of-cryptos-listed-on-coingecko-in-2021-are-now-dead-coins?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/5806256.jpeg

5802907,https://newsbtc.com/?p=512691,1671290411,Litecoin Hits Short-Term Low As Price Breaks Below Parallel Channel,"The Litecoin price has tanked further over the last 24 hours. On their respective charts, the prices of major altcoins reflect the price action of Bitcoin. As BTC slipped close to 3%, LTC also tanked nearly 8% on the daily chart. Recovery for Litecoin seems far-fetched from what the technical outlook suggests. A rise in Bitcoin’s price may help LTC for a while, but the altcoin’s demand must rise in order for the price to reverse. The short-term price thesis for LTC points towards continued lower price action. Since the coin has moved to a short-term low on its daily chart, the chance of a reversal cannot be fully negated either. For the past few weeks, the altcoin has been moving in a parallel channel, between $79 and $68 respectively. Investors had expected that LTC would break on the upside as BTC was attempting to register daily gains on its chart. Despite Litecoin moving above the $70 price mark, demand was not on the side of the bulls. This could mean that demand was lower at higher levels for Litecoin. On the other hand, market capitalization noted a slight uptick, which could also hint at the coin attempting to turn its price around. Related Reading: Double-Digit Losses Brings Doge Below Critical Level, More Pain To Follow? Litecoin Price Analysis: One-Day Chart LTC was trading at $68 at press time. The altcoin got to this price level after falling through the lower line of the parallel channel. Its current resistance mark would be at $70, breaching which the coin might face another setback at $74. As LTC continues to fall, the local support line for the altcoin was $66, falling through which LTC could halt at $56. This would cause the coin to lose another 15% of its value. The amount of Litecoin traded in the last session shot up, and that signified selling pressure intensifying on the chart. Technical Analysis As LTC broke below the lower band of the parallel channel, the buying strength could not sustain itself. The Relative Strength Index pierced through the half-line and stood near 40. This indicated that sellers were countering buyers at press time. In accordance with the same, the price of the altcoin was below the 20-Simple Moving Average line. Moving below the 20-SMA meant that sellers were driving the price momentum in the market. The altcoin depicted that sellers were strong in the market. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence reads the price momentum and trend, painted red histograms. These red histograms were sell signals for the altcoin. The Aroon Indicator indicates a trend; as the blue line (Aroon down) crossed over the yellow line (Aroon down), it signals a downtrend for the Litecoin price.

The network’s perception of FTX was drastically altered by the occurrence, and the resulting fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) proved challenging to dispel. Almost 9% of the token’s value was wiped out today, perhaps because of the fallout from the exchange’s downfall, indicating a deepening bear market. In addition, the CryptoSlam data reveals that the NFT market in the ecosystem has been experiencing severe declines in trading volume and new buyers. DeFiLlama also reported that SOL’s TVL had dropped by another 10%. When compared to the all-time high in TVL in November of $1.02 billion, the current value of $265.43 million represents a staggering drop of 73.46%. Data from Messari, however, indicates that Solana is very much alive.

For example, JumpCrypto is working on a C++ client for the token’s validator called Firedancer. Because of this, the impact of bugs on the Solana blockchain would be mitigated. However, such endeavors necessitate time to germinate and grow. At the moment, there are some security holes in Solana that should be fixed. The Solana DeFi protocol Raydium was compromised on December 16. This resulted in investors and traders losing approximately $2 million. This is expected to diminish confidence in the token further.

The increased link between SOL and BTC could become problematic if Bitcoin’s market performance continues to deteriorate. As the US Federal Reserve prepares for a further hike in interest rates, macroeconomic considerations will also play a role. The future of Solana is looking bleak at the moment. But, hopefully, as the situation improves, FUD surrounding the ecosystem may diminish. However, if the existing status quo is not altered, SOL might fall to $10.

As of writing, UNI is down 2.4% with subsequent drops in the weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly timescales. This negative market sentiment can be seen on-chain. In the time after its release in November, the volume of NFT transactions processed by Uniswap’s marketplace aggregator has dropped significantly, as reported by Dune Analytics. Numbers show that there were only 39 recorded transactions today, down from 446 on November 30. That is a drop of 91.25%. This contradicts what Uniswap Labs COO Mary-Catherin “MC” Lader stated to Fortune in an interview. She stated that the NFTs’ underlying technology is still in its infancy. Other proponents of the technology have utilized this reasoning. Whether or not the NFT business is in its infancy, data indicates that it is barely alive, with few customers and sellers, as seen by large declines in trade volume and sales.

Related Reading: Stablecoins Flow Into Spot Exchanges, Fuel For Christmas Bitcoin Rally? Macroeconomic factors have historically impacted crypto prices. Recently, the FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) levels in the market were high, taking a toll on crypto and investor sentiment. Meanwhile, the Binance vs. Reuters tussle sparked a considerable amount of withdrawals from the exchange. However, anxiety is reducing, and normalcy has returned to the market. Bitcoin and other altcoins have recorded gains in the past 24 hours as the market looks to recover. But Shiba Inu has dipped in the last 24 hours, losing above 7% of its value to trade at $0.0000088. Whale Transfers Over 210 Billion SHIB Lookonchain, an on-chain analysis platform, reported that a whale transferred 207.2 billion SHIB tokens valued at $1.9 million to Binance. The transfer took place at 01:54 PM UTC. This whale also dumped close to 4 billion tokens in a 7-day timeframe pushing the sell-off figures to more than 210 billion. This transfer affected the price, making it lose 3% a few hours after the transfer. The ripple effect of this activity also caused the asset to fall below its support level by another 3%. The coin price decreased by 6% before the U.S. Federal Reserve revealed its rate hike decision. Whale In Control Of SHIB Price Momentum The controversial whale had moved 3.49 trillion SHIB for 2.37 ETH, valued at $2,233 via Uniswap in 2020. It spent 1.83 ETH on 2.27 trillion SHIB tokens and 1.22 trillion using the addresses 0x5952 and 0x92f2. The whale made its last purchase on February 9, 2021, and has only sold Shiba Inu since then for profit. After the token rallied in 2021, the whale took short positions for its holdings. Lookonchain places the total token sold by this whale since April 13, 2021, at 2.94 trillion SHIB. The whale will make close to $18.3 million if it sells at the current market price.

The coin lost over 7% of its value over the last 24 hours. On a weekly time frame, ADA was down by 14%. The extended price pullback might continue, so investors should be wary of their next move. The ADA price was unsettled; the only way investors can make gains is to sell now and buy when the coin dips further, as it would recover lost gains by correcting itself. The technical outlook for the coin supported the bearish thesis and emphasized that ADA might nosedive below its local support line. The trading volume of Cardano also dipped, indicating that sellers have taken over the market. In case of a price correction, if ADA manages to move above the $0.30 price mark, then the bulls will make a comeback. If bearish momentum continues to prevail, then investors will be presented with a shorting opportunity. Related Reading: Stablecoins Flow Into Spot Exchanges, Fuel For Christmas Bitcoin Rally? Cardano Price Analysis: One-Day Chart ADA was trading at $0.26 at the time of writing. The altcoin continues to remain slippery ever since it lost the $0.44 support line. As accumulation remained considerably low on the chart, there are chances that the token’s value will drop further. Overhead resistance for the coin stood at $0.28 and then at $0.29. There will be rigid resistance at the $0.30 mark. In the event of the price falling further, the first stop would be at $0.24 and then at $0.22. The amount of ADA traded in the last session declined, indicating a fall in demand for the altcoin. Technical Analysis The altcoin has remained in seller territory for most of November and all of this month. Confirming that, the Relative Strength Index was parked underneath the 20-mark. This was a sign of overselling, indicating that the altcoin was heavily undervalued. ADA dipped below the 20-Simple Moving Average line, and that meant lowered demand. It also depicted that the sellers were driving the price momentum in the market. In accordance with the other technical indicators, the coin formed a sell signal on its daily chart. This would point to a shorting opportunity for investors in order to make up for the loss they incurred. The Moving Average Convergence underwent a bearish crossover and formed a red signal bar, which was the sell signal for the altcoin. MACD reads the price momentum, and the indicator agrees with the bears. The Directional Movement Index portrays the price direction. DMI was negative as -DI (orange) was above the +DI (blue) line. The Average Directional Index (red) was up and above the 20-mark, meaning that bearish price action is gaining strength.

Bitcoin Long-Term Holder SOPR Spikes Today As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, some BTC long-term holders seem to have taken profits in the past day. The relevant indicator here is the “Spent Output Profit Ratio,” which tells us whether Bitcoin investors as a whole are selling their coins at a profit or at a loss right now. When this metric has a value greater than 1, it means the average holder has been moving their coins at some profit recently. On the other hand, values below the threshold suggest the overall market has been realizing some loss. Naturally, SOPR exactly equal to 1 implies that the investors are just breaking-even with their selling. Related Reading: Stablecoins Flow Into Spot Exchanges, Fuel For Christmas Bitcoin Rally? The “long-term holder” (LTH) group is a Bitcoin cohort that includes all investors who have been holding onto their coins since at least 155 days ago, without having moved or sold them from a single address. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin SOPR specifically for these LTHs during the last 15 days: Looks like the EMA16 value of the metric has shot up in the last few hours | Source: CryptoQuant As the above graph shows, the Bitcoin LTH SOPR (EMA16) has observed a sharp spike above 1 during the past day. This means that these holders have harvested some profits today. Statistically, LTHs are the investors least likely to sell at any point, so any dumping from them can have noticeable consequences on the BTC market. Related Reading: End Of Litecoin Rally? LTC Plunges 7% In Last 24 Hours From the chart, it’s apparent that when the indicator last saw such a large spike in its value, the price of the crypto had plunged down shortly after. Interestingly, the latest spike has only come after BTC has plunged down under $17k. Usually, such holders sell for profits during rallies, but here the dumping has come after the bullish momentum has already passed over. This could be a sign that with all the FUD going around in the market right now, these supposed diamond hands have also broken down and feel bearish about the prospects of Bitcoin at the moment. Such a trend is likely to be negative for the price, and might take the crypto even further lower.

The most popular cryptocurrency is presently selling at $16,723, a decrease of 2.5% over the past week. There has been significant selling pressure on the cryptocurrency market as a whole, resulting in a 6% correction and a $50 billion loss over the past 24 hours. As a result of the latest price decline, BTC has let go of all weekly gains and returned to the red zone. TradingView and Cointelegraph Markets Pro data followed BTC/USD as it reached multi-day lows on Bitstamp at $16,928. The pair reversed its entire advance to one-month highs in response to the most recent macroeconomic data and the US Federal Reserve’s decision to raise interest rates. Similarly, the price of Ethereum has dropped more than 7% in the previous 24 hours, according to figures from CoinGecko. The second-largest cryptocurrency has decelerated during the past week, trading below $1,178. Bitcoin and Ethereum accounted for the vast majority of the $117 million in leveraged positions that were wiped out throughout the entire cryptocurrency market.

Mazars Group, the auditor for Binance’s Proof-of-Reserves, severed ties with the exchange on Friday. In addition, the current crypto market decline mirrors Wall Street’s severe downturn. Friday marked another 1% fall for the Dow Jones. This price decline is the result of the central bank’s vigorous monetary tightening. Bitcoin appeared to conclude the year on a positive note at one point after reacting positively to US inflation and Consumer Price Index (CPI) statistics as well as subsequent Fed interest rate decisions. The CPI measures the rate of price change for a range of goods. The rate increased by 0.1% in November, which is slower than the rate of inflation in October. At that time, the CPI report suggested a 0.3% price increase.

Riot Blockchain estimated CleanSpark's forecasted 2023 EV/EBITDA multiple would be an industry best 2.3x. CleanSpark's average sale price per Bitcoin in fiscal 2022 was over $35,000. In fiscal Q4 the cost of revenues per Bitcoin, which is primarily the energy component, were $13,500. This compares to $11,000 for the full fiscal year. There is much to like about CleanSpark (NASDAQ: CLSK ). Put simply, the company's enterprise value is low relative to its profitable and operating share of the total Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) network hash rate. This is true on both a past and estimated forward basis. Excluding the liquidity challenged Core Scientific ( CORZ ), in November CleanSpark remarkably had the highest Bitcoin production of all the large, publicly traded U.S. and Canada miners. Though its Bitcoin holdings are extremely low, CleanSpark has a relatively strong balance sheet with an enviable debt-to-EBITDA ratio. On a fundamental level CleanSpark represents a value, but macro factors, including interest rate uncertainty and the ongoing energy crisis, are confining its stock to the top of my watchlist for now. The article below details CleanSpark's production outlook, including the recent negative Lancium news. The somewhat dynamic rig and energy costs picture will be covered. It also considers the company's interesting, and arguably solid, balance sheet and financing strategy. As a conclusion, I will look ahead to next year and the possible peak in interest rate expectations as well a moderation in the energy crisis and growing certainty around prices. As a precursor to the discussion, consider the graphic below from Riot Blockchain ( RIOT ) and FactSet. The graphic uses current market data and average analyst estimates to show enterprise values sized against projected EBITDAs. Note Argo Blockchain (ARBKF) and Core Scientific were excluded because of their distressed situations. So when one fairly adjusts market cap for cash and debt and then compares that to expected earnings, Riot and CleanSpark represent a value. riotblockchain.com/investors/company-information/presentations CleanSpark Projected Growth At Owned Locations Off 17%, CleanSpark led the miners down on Thursday following its earnings announcement and substantial cut to its calendar 2023 hash rate projection. CleanSpark has a partnership with Lancium, a developer of clean energy campuses in Texas, and had planed to deploy 6.6 EH/s of capacity by mid-2023 at their new hosting facilities. The completion of the project is now doubtful and the timeline is pushed out at least six months. CleanSpark has lowered their 22.4 EH/s guidance for year-end 2023 to 16 EH/s. Importantly, note that CleanSpark does not have deposits with Lancium. cleanspark.com The green shaded area above represents hosted exahash; note its total is expected to decline in the final quarter of 2023. The four named locations show below, and in blues and purple above, are all in Georgia. Interestingly, Georgia has a large nuclear supply component and Georgia Power is the first in the U.S. to expand its nuclear footprint over the past three decades. Growth and expansion are coming at both Washington and Sandersville, which were newly acquired over the last fiscal year. cleanspark.com In August I wrote a piece titled: Is Riot Blockchain's Strategy Beating Marathon Digital's? The article discussed how Riot was moving to a vertically integrated housing and power infrastructure while Marathon Digital ( MARA ) was using an asset light strategy reliant on hosting providers. Of course, Marathon's plan has proved problematic with continued delays and even the notable bankruptcy of partner Compute North, where substantial deposits are at risk. While not arguing the likely shelving of the Lancium partnership is a good thing, in general it has proved better for the large cap miners to limit reliance on hosting partners as well as the entanglements of providing hosting services themselves. CleanSpark Rig And Energy Costs Picture CleanSpark has no outstanding commitments for mining equipment and is in the market for about 95,000 miners to fill the Washington and Sandersville expansions. CleanSpark currently has some high-end MicroBT equipment and some top-of-the-line Bitmain S19 XPs. But they are generally looking to acquire earlier models from the S19 Series such as the S19j Pros that have a strong ROI. By not locking in equipment contracts prior to securing power, CleanSpark is able to take advantage of the current market disruption and acquire rigs at a substantial discount to their peers. This discount is likely 50-75% in many cases. What we're seeing right now from a rig pricing point of view is we are seeing buying opportunities continue to persist in the teens. And we do expect to -- and what I mean teens, it's in the dollars per terahash anywhere from $11 to $19 and most of that on the low end, depending on if the units are state side or not. What we are anticipating is we're anticipating there to be plenty of inventory available, especially over the first six months of next year. CEO Zach Bradford, Fiscal Q4 2022 Results - Earnings Call , 12/14/2022 On the energy costs front, the situation is more concerning. For the fourth quarter power prices on a weighted average basis were over $.05 per kWh. Cost of revenues, which is primarily the energy component, were $13,500 per Bitcoin, this compares to $11,000 for the full fiscal 2022 year. For reference, other cash costs, such as general and administrative costs, represent another $6000-$7000 per coin. These increased energy costs are not just cutting into margins but also have an effect on production. While uptimes were still over 90% in fiscal Q4, power pricing peaks did cause some curtailment on lower efficiency equipment. Balance Sheet, Financing Strategy and Dilution As of September 2022 (cleanspark.com) In part, CleanSpark has a relatively clean balance sheet because of their Bitcoin retention strategy. Bradford explains: Since October last year, we've used our Bitcoin to fund our operations and growth, and that has made a big difference for us. For example, our average sale price per Bitcoin in fiscal 2022 was over $35,000 of Bitcoin. CEO Zach Bradford, Fiscal Q4 2022 Results - Earnings Call , 12/14/2022 (link above) Maintaining low debt relative to earnings is one key for the large cap miners in surviving the current cycle. Core Scientific's recent debt related liquidity issues somewhat prove this importance. Again, Bradford explains: Our ability to mine Bitcoin efficiently and profitably during a bear market is a direct reflection of our disciplined operations and low debt leverage. CEO Zach Bradford, Fiscal Q4 2022 Results - Earnings Call , 12/14/2022 (link above) But going forward, CleanSpark's growth is going to require substantial dilution. The company recently filed to refresh their shelf offering and plans sell up to $500 million of common stock during one or more public offerings over the next three years. My understanding is that the capital expense on the buildouts at Washington and Sandersville still require $70 million in funding and by my calculation the rig purchases discussed above will be an additional ~$140 million. We make acquisitions within a specific ROI range, because we expect them to be accretive to the shareholders in the long run. This move allows us to maneuver through a bear market while strengthening our operations and establishing a platform for growth. CEO Zach Bradford, Fiscal Q4 2022 Results - Earnings Call , 12/14/2022 (link above) Final Thoughts: Interest Rates And Energy Pricing Before moving from a hold to a buy recommendation for CleanSpark, I am looking to two indicators. First, have we reached a peak and stabilization of expectations for the terminal rate for the federal funds rate? Interest rate sensitive assets like tech stocks, as well as digital assets including Bitcoin, can't begin to recover in an environment where this expectation continually shifts up. Consider the chart below from the recent projection materials provided by the FOMC and other Fed members following the December meeting. The height of the bars represents the number of participants projecting a given year-end 2023 federal funds rate, see right side for the scale. The dotted line shows their September projections. In the chart below note the substantial shift up in expectations. federalreserve.gov I am looking for these projections to stabilize or shift down (to the left) before fully deploying new funds allocated to digital assets. The next Summary of Economic Projections from the Fed will not be out until March 22nd. But the CME has a ""FedWatch Tool"" that is more complete and follows market expectations real-time. When following the link, note the tabs for each different meeting month next year, that one can track the changes over time at the bottom, and that there are differences between the markets expectations for the Fed and the Fed's own projections. There will always be fluctuations short-term, but over time it is necessary for these probabilities to stabilize rather than continually move up (to the right). cmegroup.com The second indicator relates to the energy pricing picture. Looking ahead, from the March earnings report for calendar Q4'22 we can again compute the cost of revenues per Bitcoin. Look for any moderation from the $13,500 discussed above, possibly on lower energy prices compared to the calendar third quarter. CleanSpark is actually watching natural gas pricing at the Henry Hub for its models. Forecasts have natural gas prices reversing a dollar per million Btu in the Spring. cmegroup.com A reversal is important; consider the following from Bradford. ... we are actively working on securing agreements to lock in lower rates from a long-term point of view across all of our sites. And that's what we want to bring to the table in this process is our combined purchasing power with three out of the four cities we operate in, being through, through MEAG. And we expect the right time to lock in the best rates is going to be the same time that we start to see the declines. So we're kind of aiming for a springtime period to make some of those moves. CEO Zach Bradford, Fiscal Q4 2022 Results - Earnings Call , 12/14/2022 (link above) So to summarize the conclusion, I am still in a holding pattern for CleanSpark. The company's production fundamentals and financing strategy are strong, but macro factors surrounding interest rates and energy pricing are unresolved. I am waiting for a sustained pivot in expectations for the peak of the federal funds rate, as well as some assurances CleanSpark's energy costs are contained and they are capturing any reversal in pricing.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4565023-cleanspark-tops-2023-bitcoin-watchlist-despite-texas-turmoil?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/5758189.jpeg
