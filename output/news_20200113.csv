42431394,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2Edh,1578950141,US Judge Gives Craig Wright Until Feb. 3 to Access 1.1M Bitcoin at Heart of Ongoing Lawsuit,"Craig S. Wright, one of crypto’s most litigious engineers, struck a minor victory in court last Friday.      United States District Judge Beth Bloom said facts previously established in the trial were now in dispute, according to a court document filed Jan. 10 to the District Court of Southern Florida.      This is the latest turn in an ongoing trial brought by Ira Kleiman, brother to Wright’s deceased business partner David Kleiman. Kleiman is suing for half of an $8.87 billion fortune (1.1 million bitcoin), said to be encrypted in a “Tulip Trust.”      Concluding a summer-long sanctions and contempt hearing, District Magistrate Bruce Reinhart found the nChain chief scientist in contempt of court for failing to produce a full list of his bitcoin holdings acquired before Dec. 31, 2013.      Reinhart awarded Kleiman $650,000 in legal expenses, and deemed it a fact that the plaintiff retains a 50/50 ownership in Wright’s assets and intellectual property, developed jointly with David Kleiman. Reinhart also questioned the validity of Wright’s testimony, describing it as “contradictory.” Wright called these sanctions “draconian.”      Justice Bloom now says the facts are unsettled. The previous hearing was focused solely on the amount and location of Wright’s bitcoin, she said, so Wright’s partnership with David Kleiman was beyond Judge Reinhart’s remit. She also asserts the amount of bitcoin at the center of the case “remains an issue.”      Wright was granted a request to extend a period of discovery so that a “mysterious” bonded courier can unlock the encrypted Tulip Trust. Wright claims the trust is currently inaccessible because several keys are held by an unnamed intermediary. Wright has until Feb. 3 to file a notice with the court that the courier “has appeared from the shadows.”      “The Court questions whether it is remotely plausible that the mysterious ‘bonded courier’ is going to arrive, let alone that he will arrive in January 2020 as the Defendant now contends,” Bloom writes. Wright previously testified it would be “impossible” to comply with the court order to identify his bitcoin before the bonded courier returned 100 percent of the assets to his control on Jan. 1, 2020.      Wright has not confirmed publicly whether the courier arrived and has not moved bitcoin said to be held in the trust.    Trust issues    One day before Justice Bloom’s reversal, evidence of a third Tulip Trust entered the public court record, which could overturn much of what was previously known about the case.      In the original Trust document, it’s claimed Wright entrusted all his cryptographic assets to David Kleiman in 2012, to be returned in full eight years later. This directly challenges Ira Kleiman’s allegation that Wright expropriated his brother’s bitcoin. Elsewhere, Kleiman has submitted communications from Wright showing he's owed 30 percent of the trust's holdings.      Questions over the legitimacy of the Tulip Trust document have been floated, as it contains a font type created in 2015. Wright said this is due to a court scanner using a newer version of the font.      Buried among 428 other documents, the Tulip Trust III filing may contain evidence as to who actually has ownership over bitcoin mined jointly by Wright and the late Dave Kleiman. The document’s details are unknown, and Wright has requested it remain sealed. He was granted 10 days to produce a redacted version.      Wright submitted the document “without any explanation as to its late disclosure, or even an email” signaling its production, according to plaintiff's counsel Velvel Freedman of Roche Freedman LLP.      In the most recent filing, Judge Bloom upheld a view that Wright willfully obstructed the court proceedings, and upheld a sanction for Kleiman’s legal fees.      “[Wright] was evasive, refused to give and interpret words in their very basic meanings, was combative and became defensive when confronted with previous inconsistencies,” Bloom writes.      Kleiman is represented by Kyle Roche and Velvel Freedman of Roche Freedman LLP, while Wright is represented by Rivero Mestre LLP. Neither party had responded to a request for comment by press time.      Having offered to resolve the dispute amicably, Wright reignited the trial on Oct. 31. Since then, both sides have produced a bevy of pre-trial filings, working under a compressed schedule. In December, Wright’s counsel produced 18,669 documents to the plaintiff.

42431377,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2E9h,1578943857,Why Compliance Is the Biggest Team at Bitcoin ATM Startup Coinsource,"Coinsource, a well-known bitcoin ATM company, purchased a booth at this year's Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. Given increased interest from the IRS in bitcoin ATMs, we were especially curious about how users reacted when Coinsource increased its know-your-customer (KYC) requirements.      ""Our compliance department is actually the largest department in our entire company,"" Coinsource's Derek Muhney told CoinDesk in the video above. Money-laundering concerns have long dogged the bitcoin ATM sector.      Muhney said Coinsource moved to require KYC of everyone two years ago, though the company had always required it for transactions over $800.      ""We received little to no customer feedback [about the change],"" Muhney said.      At the show, Coinsource was demoing one of its buy-only machines, where a user can use cash to buy bitcoin. The company also has machines that will dispense cash in exchange for bitcoin.      Coinsource ATMs take an 11 percent fee on any transaction. So that consumers know what they’re getting, Muhney said the company doesn’t try to make money off a spread, or the difference between the prices at which Coinsource buys and sells BTC.

42431398,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2Ebh,1578938273,This Blue-Chip Crypto Insurance Consortium Lacks One Thing – a Sizable Loss,"The Takeaway:    In a rare interview, London-based insurance firm Arch says a sizable but containable loss would demonstrate how well its $150 million crypto storage policy would react.  Only a handful of cold storage crypto policies have been written at this time; high-net-worth individuals are the main driver for the business.  Lloyd’s of London has set up a crypto subgroup within its Product Innovation Facility, which includes mega-broker Marsh.  Marsh says it has a hot wallet crime cover product in the pipeline.    An insurance company saying it hopes to pay a sizable claim sounds like a turkey looking forward to Christmas.      But that’s exactly what James Croome, fine art and specie underwriter at Arch Insurance International, says he wants his firm to do. Just to show that it can.      Arch is one of the few underwriters willing to insure cryptocurrency exchanges and custodians against the theft or loss of customer funds. London-based Arch Insurance International, which works with a number of big-name brokers offering crypto cover, has yet to pay out for any losses in this relatively new market.      If someone does manage to pull off a heist of cryptographic keys kept offline in cold storage, Arch will get a chance to demonstrate it’s good for the money, said Croome, who works out of London.      “I would like there to be a containable but sizable loss,” he said. “Because that would give evidence to our potential clients as to the service we can provide, the speed at which we will pay the claims and remind people who have bought coverage that it does work appropriately.”      Insurers have years of experience in covering specialized assets in the traditional world, whether that's fine art or the regulatory requirements to protect financial services firms. But they feel less secure with crypto because there is a shortage of data for firms to model policy rates.      In response to this, Croome helped create a consortium, including mega-broker Marsh and global law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, to offer cold storage cover for crypto assets.      Released in September, Blue Vault, which is solely owned by Arch, provides limits of up to $150 million and covers the loss of digital assets due to internal and external theft (via direct access to the storage media as opposed to remote hacking attacks) and including employee collusion. Blue Vault also covers physical damage or destruction of private keys from fires, floods, earthquakes and other catastrophic events.      Ankur Kacker, vice president and specie expert on Marsh's Digital Asset Risk Transfer (DART) team, said: “We have placed four policies for Blue Vault as of now, all in the last seven months.”      Marsh, the world’s largest insurance broker, recently announced a deal with Ledger Vault, the institution-focused arm of Ledger, the well-known hardware wallet provider for $150 million cold storage cover; Marsh is working in a similar way with crypto custodian KNOX.    Pet peeves    Arch chose to work with law firm Norton Rose Fulbright on the crypto policy because it wanted precise policy wording. Ambiguous language is a pet peeve of Croome’s.      “My biggest annoyance with the specie market is the existence of ambiguous wordings, which is why I chose to work with a legal firm with a track record in this space,” he said.      Norton Rose Fulbright has given presentations in New York, Bermuda and to the London Market to help “educate insurance markets and develop set the market and standards for cold storage of these assets,” said Nicholas Berry, a partner at the law firm. The firm also helped Lloyd’s of London with its market guidance on underwriting digital assets.      Norton Rose Fulbright enlisted the help of Peter McBurney, Professor of Computer Science, King’s College London and a consultant with the law firm, to spell out technical aspects of key management and crypto storage and create appropriate policy wording. This is an instance where the London Market has led other international markets, said Berry.      “Going back to 2018, there has been a mismatch between supply in terms of underwriting capacity and demand for those wanting cold storage or even hot crime-type cover. Some of the big brokers have been pushing the supply side to provide more cover in terms of higher limits, wider cover,” he said.      Crypto insurance is widely seen as a prerequisite for greater institutional involvement in the market. But Croome is wary of companies offering insurance policies as a marketing ploy.      “We tend not to look at insureds that are looking for a chicken-egg scenario. They feel they don’t have a current revenue stream but are hoping the existence of insurance will help speed up the point at which assets come into custody and therefore increase their revenue,” he said.      As well as Marsh, Arch has been working with Aon, the number two broker by size. Other brokers known to be exploring crypto include Arthur J. Gallagher and Paragon.      But Croome says that for now he is shying away from really broadening out his broker network for crypto.      “I think I will keep to the ones that have shown comprehension of that which we like. They understand that and therefore they can filter out the sort of things we seek to avoid,” said Croome.    Virgin territory    Insurance companies like Arch bring in third party specialists to examine physical vault security and do the same to understand and communicate the risks around the storage of crypto. “I wouldn't consider myself capable of valuing a Dutch master [painting], knowing if it was genuine or a fake.That's not my job,” said Croome.      Peter McBurney, who divides his time between academia and advising Norton Rose Fulbright’s clients on technology matters, does the equivalent of physical vault checking for the IT system that would create and store the private keys.      McBurney estimates there are still reasonably few policies written in London covering crypto cold storage, and the same in New York, although this number is increasing. “It’s still very early days, it is almost virgin territory.”      McBurney said ultra-high net worth individuals or hedge funds who already have relationships with custodians for storage of fine art or gold bullion are driving the market for crypto insurance.      “They are going to their existing physical custodians and saying, 'Can you also store our private keys?' So the custodians are going to insurers and saying, 'Can you insure us to store these private keys?' and that's where a lot of the business has originated. It's customer-driven from the individuals and the hedge funds who have large crypto holdings,” he said.      Lloyd’s of London, the centuries-old insurance market, has realized there are new revenue streams to be had with crypto. Its underwriters have launched the Product Innovation Facility, which spans some 24 markets and has over $100 million of capacity. The facility includes a crypto subgroup, where Marsh has a representative.      A spokesman for Lloyd’s said it’s too early for any on-record comment from the crypto subcommittee at this time. Marsh also did not comment on the group’s purview.      The group will likely be looking beyond cold storage to include crime bond markets; E&O (Errors and Omissions) insurance; D&O (Directors and Officers) and a general smorgasbord of potential product offerings to the digital assets world, according to sources close to the Lloyd’s market.    Hot and cold    The risk relating to crypto held on exchanges and in wallets connected to the internet is a very different animal from vaulted cold storage.      To deal with losses from third-party hacks, most of the large crypto exchanges simply self-insure, holding large amounts of bitcoin locked up for such occasions. Having battled it out in the market for some years, people like Binance chief “CZ” Changpeng Zhao or Kraken CEO Jesse Powell see insurance for hot wallets as a fundamentally flawed concept.      Arch is not looking to enter the hot wallet space any time soon. However, Croome said he can see ways the crime market could interplay with the specie world.      “We will often take an excess layer, the larger chunk of capacity above the crime policy, to very high exposures but on a much tighter coverage. They will take much broader coverage with much smaller limits,” he said.      Marsh’s Digital Asset Risk Transfer team has clearly been pursuing its own plans regarding a hot wallet product. Quizzed on the subject of hot wallet coverage, Kacker said:      “At this point in time, I don't want to let the cat out of the bag. But I can say it's in the pipeline.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | WALLET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/01/13/this-blue-chip-crypto-insurance-consortium-lacks-one-thing-a-sizable-loss,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/34f4b2da5498b834ec31feb1295c6aa04ac682d6-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383183,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uO2b,1578934521,Mobile Phone Retailer Joins China's Blockchain Land Grab With US Company Investment,"Dixintong Technology Group, whose parent company, D.Phone, is one of the largest smartphone retailers in China, has entered the blockchain space by acquiring a minority stake in a U.S. blockchain company called Monsoon Blockchain.      The agreement was signed on Jan. 7 and the stake was sold at a nine-digit valuation, according to people who are familiar with the matter.      The partnership between the two companies comes at a time when China is encouraging enterprise blockchain adoption as well as the development of emerging technologies.      Started as a mobile phone retailer in 1993, D.Phone went public in Hong Kong in 2014 with four anchor investors including Lenovo Group, Qihoo 360, China Telecom and TCL Corporation. Alibaba’s major e-commerce rival, JD.com, has also acquired 9 percent of Dixintong worth $30 million in July. The firm’s total market capitalization is around $200 million.      According to its 2018 annual report, the company sold nearly nine million cell phones in its more than 1,500 physical stores across the country, generating over $2 billion in revenue and $46 million in net profit for the year.      The parent company has made efforts to expand its businesses to other related industries. It partnered with China’s Tianjin city government in December to build an industrial park focusing on 5G and IoT with a total investment estimated to be over $3 billion.    Political boost    A slew of tech companies have explored blockchain technologies since Chinese President Jinping Xi called on the country to “seize opportunities” in the space. Stock prices skyrocketed for companies whose businesses are related to the new technology.      “When you have that level of endorsement from the government, everything moves much faster,” Donald Basile, the Monsoon's CEO, said.      The country’s two largest telecommunications services providers, China Mobile and China Telecom, are members of a consortium that runs Blockchain-Based Service Network (BSN), a state-backed blockchain infrastructure project.      The Chinese government is also rolling out 5G services in 2019 across the nation. The emerging technology would require new mobile devices. Most major carriers in China have started to offer 5G data plans and cloud services.      The Shanghai government plans to spend millions of dollars on supporting a public blockchain project and open an incubation center for startups that want to build decentralized applications (dapps) on the blockchain. Meanwhile, the Guangdong province has launched a blockchain-based project to help small and medium-sized businesses borrow money from commercial banks.      Top Chinese tech giants such as Alibaba and Baidu have also launched their own projects to integrate blockchain with cloud services.    Blockchain-based marketplace    Monsoon Blockchain touts an ethereum-based protocol that aims to use smart contracts to provide a more efficient marketplace for cloud service providers and potential clients, according to Basile.      He said prices for cloud computing and storage services could vary over time between data centers, depending on locations and capacity. Basile believes that’s where blockchain can play a role.      The firm aggregates prices and collects information about the conditions of data centers across the world. It then submits the data to the blockchain network, he said. On the other hand, companies that want to buy computing and storage services can submit their specific requirements.      The peer-to-peer blockchain-based protocol will use smart contracts to match those companies with the most suitable cloud services provider for them, according to Basile.      Users now need to buy the network’s native token with fiat currency to use the smart contracts on the blockchain. While the token is only circulated within the network, the firm may consider launching a private token sale or issue a public offering in the future when regulators have a clear guidance on the processes, Basile said.      Monsoon Blockchain worked with a spate of IT giants including IBM, Oracle and Alibaba as a data services distributor, said Basile, who previously headed Fusion-io and Violin Memory, both of which are data processing software and hardware providers.      Billion-user access?    While Monsoon Blockchain primarily serves enterprise clients, the deal with Dixintong could boost a consumer-oriented business, potentially bringing users onto its blockchain protocol.      Besides mobile devices, Dixintong also sells telecommunications services such as data plans as a licensed virtual services operator.      Basile said the partnership with Dixintong would give Monsoon the access to billions of users in China to reach a larger scale, which would be otherwise impossible in the U.S.      He said Monsoon could assign a unique identity to each smartphone user on its blockchain platform where they can enjoy cheaper data services thanks to its optimized cloud services solution.      In return, users’ data will be processed and stored in the network. When people use 5G services or devices that are connected to the internet they create much more data than the current network, and that can be valuable for companies to analyze for their business decisions, according to Basile.      “With the scale of people in China, you can have 20 million users in no time, so that’s a huge amount of computing and analytics needed to be harnessed,” Basile said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/01/13/mobile-phone-retailer-joins-chinas-blockchain-land-grab-with-us-company-investment,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/808abff1590348b3117582de77f3d4ca2c492d83-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383189,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uO8t,1578932273,"CME Takes Its Bitcoin Options Live, Competing With ICE's Bakkt","Chicago exchange CME Group has announced its highly anticipated bitcoin options are now open for trading.      Options on CME's bitcoin futures contracts launched on the CME Globex around 15:00 UTC Monday. Each contract, quoted in U.S. dollars, represents five bitcoin and is cleared centrally to avoid counterparty risk. CME relies on trade flow data from several of the large bitcoin exchanges to accurately track bitcoin's price.      Bitcoin derivatives have been available on multiple cryptocurrency exchanges since at least 2014, but CME was one of the first platforms to offer investors regulated products when it first launched its cash-settled bitcoin futures in December 2017.      Bitcoin options had a strong start to 2019. Last week, daily volumes surged to surpass $90 million by Friday, according to data collected from analytics firm Skew. Approximately 95 percent of all trades last year took place on the Dutch-based exchange Deribit, which announced Thursday it was moving its operations to Panama citing regulatory concerns.      The Binance-backed derivatives platform FTX announced Sunday it had launched its own bitcoin options contracts. Although unavailable to U.S. traders, volumes reportedly hit $1 million in the first two hours of trading, according to CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.      CME revealed plans to launch bitcoin options days before the launch of Bakkt's bitcoin futures in September. The rival platform, which is owned by the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), released its own options and cash-settled contracts in early December. CME has previously said it does not have any current plans to launch physically-delivered futures.      In the past the market has had a mixed response to bitcoin derivatives. Bitcoin hit its all-time high of near $20,000 soon after the original release of CME futures, but it plunged nearly $2,000 following the launch of Bakkt's futures contracts, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      In a note Friday, JPMorgan's managing director for global market strategy, Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, said the signs suggested institutional investors were getting ready for CME's launch. Data from the exchange show open interest for bitcoin futures increased 69 percent from year-end until last Friday, hitting a seven-month high.      ""This unusually strong activity over the past few days likely reflects the high anticipation among market participants of the option contract,"" Panigirtzoglou wrote, as reported by Bloomberg.

42383177,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uNwJ,1578929328,Coinbase Hands Nearly $1M to Cryptsy Victims After Settling Class Action Lawsuit,"Coinbase has settled a class action lawsuit brought by users of the former Cryptsy cryptocurrency exchange.      According to a set of court documents dated Nov. 27 and Dec. 10, 2019, Coinbase has agreed to turn $962,500 over to an escrow agent responsible for handling class action claims related to a previous lawsuit against Cryptsy. Lawyers for the plaintiffs, who announced the settlement Monday, have already won 11,325 BTC from this previous case.      The plaintiffs created a webpage for potential Cryptsy victims – any individuals who used the exchange before 2015 – listing upcoming key dates and outlining how they can submit claims.      The settlement concludes a three-year legal action that nearly saw a jury trial.      A hearing will be held on April 17, 2020, to either approve the preliminary settlement agreement or add further modifications as needed, according to the filing.      Brandon Leidel, designated the class representative in the class action lawsuit, will receive $2,500 due to his efforts. He brought the suit in 2016 alleging Cryptsy CEO Paul Vernon used the exchange to launder millions of dollars' worth of user funds over a multi-year period.      The case was originally filed by the Silver Miller law firm and Wites Law Firm, both of which were designated class counsel. In a statement, attorney Marc Wites said the case against Coinbase, as well as the previous lawsuit filed against Cryptsy, ""were difficult cases"" to resolve.      ""When companies go out of business, founders flee the country and the amount at issue is relatively small, most plaintiff law firms would decline to pursue the case,"" he said. ""We were the only lawyers in the country to pursue a case against Cryptsy or Coinbase, individually or as a class action, and we were able to obtain multiple meaningful recoveries for victims who would have otherwise been left without any recourse.""      David Silver of Silver Miller said he commended Coinbase ""for stepping up and resolving"" the case. The Cryptsy case shows how early exchanges, ""especially unregulated exchanges like Cryptsy, shunned regulators, laws and ultimately stole from its own clientele,"" he said.      ""This case shows that businesses in the cryptosphere bear a large measure of responsibility, from with whom they decide to do business and with whom they choose to associate,"" he said.

42383186,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uO6N,1578917859,Dish Network Files Patent for Blockchain-Based Anti-Piracy System,"One of the largest U.S. television providers has filed a patent application for a new ""anti-piracy management system"" that uses blockchain to enable owners to track how their content is being used.      Dish Network's application to the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office outlines a system that allows owners to embed an identification mark into the content's code that can be stored and regularly updated using a distributed ledger. Published by the patent office Thursday, Dish says the proposal can better monitor and enforce ownership rights, alerting platforms to when content is used without permission.      According to the filing, one of the main problems with online streaming is it has become increasingly difficult to combat content piracy. There are simply too many distribution platforms for content owners to effectively monitor. Although unauthorized content can be quickly taken down once identified, it has usually been viewed millions of times by the time they've done so.      Dish Network's anti-piracy system, which was originally filed in July 2018, would use blockchain to embed ownership data, owner's name and contact information, for example, into content that can only be uploaded and updated by the owners themselves.      The idea is it provides distribution platforms with an incorruptible reference point to ensure all published data is correctly authorized. As well as acting as a means to more efficiently check copyright, the system can also help platforms enforce ownership rights and take action against publishers who have used content without permission.      It's unclear whether Dish Network's proposed anti-piracy system would work on its own blockchain or on a pre-existing platform.      The system allows uploaders to purchase content directly from the owners. A featured exchange facility means users can pay owners in either fiat or cryptocurrencies, and in return receive unique identity tokens, which authorizes them to use the content.      These identity tokens themselves are customisable to give uploaders access for a limited time or the ability to edit the content on certain platforms. Should the uploader not have the appropriate access rights, the system can automatically notify both them and the owner that content is being used without permission.      With more than 9.5 million subscribers across the country, Dish is one of the largest satellite TV providers in the U.S. But it has struggled to maintain subscribers as more people switch to online streaming. The company sustained net ""cord-cutting"" losses of 400,000 in H2 2019, marginally below the 2018 rate where more than a million people cancelled their subscription.      In response, Dish has been quick to take action against online operators it says are using its content illegally. The company filed two separate lawsuits against two platforms early in 2018, accusing them of redistributing its paid-for content without permission and took action another in last August. The company also won a $90 million lawsuit against another online streaming service earlier in November 2018.      Other mainstream companies have also recognized blockchain's potential for improving copyright enforcement. Chinese internet giant Baidu launched a photo-sharing platform that also uses tokens to verify ownership and permission in July 2018. The Korean conglomerate CJ revealed last year it was also developing its own copyright management system for the music industry.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | SPONSORED | WALLET,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/01/13/dish-network-files-patent-for-blockchain-based-anti-piracy-system,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/936bad04bbb607601063d27a170a6e77546df7d3-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383187,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uOA9,1578914416,Bitcoin Makes Biggest Weekly Price Gain Since October,"View  Bitcoin jumped more than 11 percent last week, confirming a falling channel breakout (bullish reversal) on the weekly chart.  The breakout has opened the doors for a re-test of October highs above $10,000.  For the next 24 hours, the focus is on $8,200, a level that has proved a tough nut to crack in the last few days. A strong rejection above $8,200 could yield a temporary drop to sub-$8,000 levels.    Bitcoin logged double-digit price gains last week, confirming a reversal from a six-month downtrend.      The top cryptocurrency by market cap gained 11.2 percent in the seven days to Jan. 12, the biggest weekly gain since October, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      Prices rallied by 16 percent in the third week of October. Since then, bitcoin has managed to score gains in just three weeks.      During the bleak six months to Dec. 31, the cryptocurrency eked out double-digit weekly gains just two times. Further, bitcoin suffered losses in 15 out of 27 weeks, with two weeks ending roughly flat.      Clearly, the bears were in control in the second half of 2019. Prices fell from highs above $13,000 to $6,425 during the period, establishing a series of lower highs and lower lows on the weekly chart.      That downward trajectory, however, has ended with last week's 11 percent gain and the path of least resistance is now on the higher side.    Weekly chart    Last week's candle closed well above the upper edge of the bearish channel, confirming a bullish breakout.      The pattern indicates the pullback from $13,800 has ended and the bull run from lows near $4,100 seen in the first week of April 2019 has resumed.      The 11 percent rise has also confirmed the bearish-to-bullish trend change signaled by the hammer candle created in the third week of December.      The activation of twin bullish cues is backed by a rise in buying volumes to the highest since November. Notably, last week's volume bar violated the descending trendline, validating the price breakout.      The cryptocurrency has also moved back above the bullish ascending 50-week moving average.      The odds appear stacked in favor of a rise to $10,350 (October high). A weekly close (Sunday, UTC) below $7,342 would invalidate breakout, although that looks unlikely currently.      At press time, bitcoin is changing hands at $8,110.    Pre-halving breakout    With the breakout, the odds of bitcoin repeating history by crossing the 2019 high of $13,880 ahead of the May 2020 mining reward halving have strengthened.      Programmed into the blockchain, the halving cuts the amount of bitcoin created every 10 minutes by half. The process is repeated every four years.      Historically, bitcoin has hit a new market cycle top (the highest point from the preceding bear market low) in the calendar year of a halving, but before the event, according to popular analyst Rekt Capital.      For instance, bitcoin bottomed out near $150 in January 2015 and rose to a high of $502 in November 2015, confirming a bullish reversal. Prices then fell back to $365 in February 2016 before hitting a new cycle top $778 in June – a month ahead of the reward halving, which took place in July 2016.      Note that the high of $778 reached in June 2016 was the highest price from the bear market low of $150, but was well short of the record high (at the time) of $1,153 reached in December 2013.      Similar price action was seen in the 12 months to November 2012, when bitcoin underwent its first reward halving, as noted by Rekt Capital.      So, if history is a guide, bitcoin could clock highs in the range of $13,880 (2019 high) to $20,000 (record high) before the third halving, due in four months.      As for the next 24 hours, $8,200 is the level to beat for the bulls.    Daily chart    A convincing break above $8,200 has remained elusive since Jan. 7. Prices printed a high of $8,463 on Jan. 8 but closed below $8,200. The bulls also failed to secure a daily close above $8,200 on Jan. 11.      With the breakout confirmed on the weekly chart, though, bitcoin looks set to scale $8,200 and challenge recent highs above $8,460.      Another stronger rejection at or above $8,200 could yield a pullback to $7,667 (Jan. 11 low).

The firm is initially focusing on the Southeast Asian market, saying that it plans to disrupt an industry so far in the hands of ""slow"" and ""costly"" traditional financial institutions.      “It’s vital that we build an ecosystem to provide Lightnet access to our partners’ vast user base and facilitate deeper penetration into local markets. We project that within three years, Lightnet will facilitate over $50 billion worth of annual transactions through our industry-leading partner network,” Tridbodi Arunanondchai, Lightnet’s vice-chairman, said in the report.      The firm's chairman, Chatchaval Jiaravanon, is the son of Sumet Jiaravanon, executive chairman of Thailand’s biggest conglomerate, Charoen Pokphand Group. In 2018, he bought Fortune Magazine for $150 million.      The chairman said earlier this month that Lightnet would grow, in part, due to planned acquisitions. He also told Bloomberg the firm is targeting more than $50 billion in transactions annually within three years.      Lightnet is building several solutions, with the first expected to carry out its inaugural transaction this quarter. The firm's CEO, Suvicha Sudchai, told Business Insider plans include adding up to 500,000 agents across Asia, as well as partnerships with remittance firms such as MoneyGram, Seven Bank, Yeahka and Ksher.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/01/13/asian-conglomerates-lead-31m-round-for-blockchain-remittance-firm-lightnet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5f35eaba49a572b829bbfb55d87b230864b16877-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While the nation's industry already follows a self-imposed rule setting a maximum of four-times leverage, the watchdog aims to halve that due to the volatility of the crypto markets, the article says.      The 2x cap was determined by analyzing historical price movements, as well as cryptocurrency regulations in Europe and the U.S., the sources told the Times. The decision also follows talks with the the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association – the country's self-regulatory body.      Margin trading is trading assets using borrowed funds, with leverage being the multiple of the initial deposit that can be borrowed.
