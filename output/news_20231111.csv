However, Binance was able to quickly intervene in the matter, alerting their partners to the situation, who were then able to freeze the wallet. In doing so, Binance foiled the kidnapper’s access to $11.8 million of the $12.5 million loot. The incident recounted by CZ is not a new occurrence in the crypto space, as sometimes bad actors resort to such brazen methods to steal crypto assets from investors. In 2020, Le Duc Nguyen, a Vietnamese investor, was kidnapped and robbed of about VND 35 billion ($1.5 million) worth of crypto assets by another Vietnamese man named Ho Ngoc Tai with the help of 15 gang members. Tai claimed that he lost 1,000 Bitcoins valued at VND 100 billion by investing in other tokens based on financial advice. The crypto investor felt cheated and proceeded to obtain a “refund” via forceful means. Albeit, Tai and his hired hands were eventually apprehended by the police and faced trial in May 2023, during which 14 of the 16 culprits were given sentences ranging from 9 to 19 imprisonments.

20063549,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560240,1699729248,New All-Time Highs For Bitcoin In 2023? Analyst Shares Ultra Bullish Prediction,"The flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is up by over 100% year-to-date (YTD). Despite these impressive gains, there is still reason to believe that the crypto token’s resurgence isn’t done, as there could still be new highs before the year runs out based on analysis from prominent figures in the community. Bitcoin To Hit $69,000 This Year? In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, prominent crypto analyst Dave the Wave suggested that Bitcoin could surge to its previous highs this last quarter of the year. Although he didn’t state what highs exactly, the accompanying chart he shared in the post showed that he was hinting at Bitcoin’s all-time high of about $69,000. A run to previous #btc highs this last quarter is not unthinkable. pic.twitter.com/INesJPY9ov — dave the wave🌊🌓 (@davthewave) November 9, 2023 Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) Poised For A Bullish Surge, Analyst Who Predicted 2021 Fall Says This isn’t the first time the crypto analyst has shared his belief that Bitcoin could hit $69,000 this year. In an earlier X post, he shared a similar chart, which put up a price target of $70,000 based on the speculation of “another mini-parabola frontrunning the halving.” It is not unusual for the market to pump significantly, as historical data suggests. Bitcoin’s price has increased significantly before and after every halving event. Before the most recent halving event, which took place in 2020, BTC rose by over 17% in the weeks leading up to it and saw a further 559% increase after the event. Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $37.072. Chart: TradingView.com However, many might argue that an all-time high (ATH) before the halving event, which takes place in April 2024, seems like a far reach, especially if the analyst is projecting that the new high will occur before this year runs out. Bitcoin To Hit New All-Time High Before April? While a new all-time high before the year runs out seems like a big task, some prominent figures have, however, backed the crypto token to hit a new ATH before April. One of them happens to be Bitcoin OG and founder of Blockstream, Adam Back. Interestingly, Back predicted (back in August) that BTC will hit or even surpass $100,000 before March 31st, 2024. To show how confident he was of his assertion, the crypto founder went as far as placing a bet with another X user who disagreed with his position. They both agreed to wager a bet of 1 million satoshis, with the winner (depending on Bitcoin’s price by March 31, 2024) taking all. Related Reading: Solana Breaks Past $54 On Steady Price Momentum – Will SOL Hit $60 This Month? The CEO of Jan3 and a fellow Bitcoiner, Samson Mow, had also agreed with Back in some way, as he believes that Bitcoin will also hit a new ATH pre-halving and not post. However, unlike Back, he didn’t mention any price target.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) happens to be one of the altcoins that many seem to have their eyes on during this period. And if the prediction of this machine learning algorithm is anything to go by, it would seem that these SHIB holders are well positioned for more profitable times ahead. SHIB’s Projected Price By December According to data from the price prediction algorithm on the crypto analytics platform CoinCodex, SHIB’s price is predicted to hit $0.000009534 by December 11. Such price action will represent about a 10% increase from its current price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Ready To Take-Off? Analyst Who Predicted $37,000 Reveals What’s Next Meanwhile, the sentiment around the token continues to be bullish, which suggests that many expect the token to rally further despite the impressive gains it has already recorded. With such a bullish sentiment, CoinCodex’s prediction seems more attainable as the ecosystem could see more whales and retail investors jump in on the token. If that happens, it could further add to the buying pressure, an important metric to determine if SHIB could continue riding on this momentum to attain CoinCodex’s prediction by December. In line with the bullish sentiment, CoinCodex noted that 24 technical analysis indicators are signaling bullish signals, with only a mere 4 indicators signaling bearish signals. Based on its forecast, the platform predicts that now remains a good time to buy the meme coin despite the impressive gains it has already recorded. Another important metric that CoinCodex highlighted was the fact Shiba Inu’s RSI value currently stands at around 63.05, indicating that the token is neither oversold nor overbought. As to the exact time to buy the token, investors might be able to take a cue from CoinCodex’s five-day prediction as the platform expects a correction to around $0.000008008. The Fundamentals Are Aligning For Shiba Inu The Shiba Inu ecosystem has continued to record interesting developments that suggest that the fundamentals are as bullish as the charts and technical analysis. Most recently, the SHIB non-custodial wallet was launched in a bid to promote the ecosystem’s vision of a decentralized state and enhance the crypto experience of Shibizens. Related Reading: MicroStrategy’s $4.6 Billion Bitcoin Bet Pays Off, Here’s How Much It’s Worth Now Interestingly, the wallet is equipped with certain features that address the fears of using a non-custodial wallet.

Notably, the cryptocurrency has achieved its all-time high, experiencing an impressive 66% increase over the previous week. Examining the monthly performance charts reveals an even more substantial upward trajectory, with KAS exhibiting a remarkable surge of over 90%. Zooming out to a year-long perspective, the altcoin has witnessed an astonishing increase of over 2,000%, showcasing its significant growth over this extended period. Investors are closely monitoring Kaspa as it continues to showcase strong bullish momentum, reflecting the cryptocurrency market’s dynamic nature. The rapid and substantial increases in both short-term and long-term intervals underscore the token’s potential for high returns. Kaspa Shows Mettle, Pulls Off Its Own Rally With Bitcoin surpassing the $36,800 threshold and Ethereum exceeding $2,000, the native token of Kaspa pulled off its own ascent, rising from approximately $0.070986 to reach an unprecedented peak of $0.092917. Based on the aforementioned data, it can be observed that Kaspa is one of the limited number of tokens now experiencing their highest recorded values. Many cryptocurrencies registered a significant decline from their historical peak values following the occurrence of a market downturn commonly referred to as the “crypto winter.” This period witnessed the collapse of prominent crypto entities such as Terra Luna and FTX crypto exchange. Based on the data provided by CoinMarketCap, it can be observed that the trading volume of Kaspa’s (KAS) has experienced a significant surge of more than 95%. Source: CoinMarketCap Additionally, the market capitalization of KAS has exhibited a notable gain of nearly 20%. Furthermore, there has been a significant increase in trading volume, with a jump of around 380% compared to the preceding week. The current market capitalization of the project stands just above $1.8 billion. Related Reading: Solana Breaks Past $54 On Steady Price Momentum – Will SOL Hit $60 This Month?

Source: CoinMarketCap KAS’s future trajectory remains uncertain, with the potential for further rally or a correction. Reaching $1 would signify a remarkable 1062% growth, though it seems unlikely currently. The possibility of a correction looms, despite community members maintaining a target of at least $0.10. The recent surge in Bitcoin (BTC) to a yearly high of over $36k may have influenced KAS’s all-time high, suggesting that KAS and other altcoins could follow BTC’s lead if it continues to rally.

Demand for on-chain leverage remained muted, with DeFi TVL growth keeping pace with the rise in ETH prices. Bitcoin's performance is gaining attention from potential clients who are shunning U.S. government debt and foreign central banks are buying gold, leading to increased interest in Bitcoin as a potential alternative. In October, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) experienced its most significant surge since January, witnessing increased flows into its ETNs and ETFs, partly driven by investor anticipation of upcoming Bitcoin ETF launches in the U.S. Please note that VanEck may have a position(s) in the digital asset(s) described below. Bitcoin surged by the most since January, +28% in October, as digital assets outpaced the Nasdaq (-2%) for the second month in a row. Large-caps (+21%) again beat small-caps (+4%), even as the ETH-to-BTC ratio fell below the levels set during the 3AC liquidation in June 2022. Demand for on-chain leverage remained somewhat muted, with DeFi TVL growth merely keeping pace with the incremental rise in ETH prices, hardly an impressive feat. Rather, the activity came from the regulated space: flows into Bitcoin ETNs and ETFs globally reached $412M in the month compared to $630M total YTD, while the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ( CME ) share of Bitcoin futures activity reached record levels (23%). We attribute this surge to astute investors positioning themselves ahead of the impending wave of roughly a dozen or so spot Bitcoin ETFs gearing to launch on U.S. securities exchanges by mid-January 2024.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Amidst the sharp sell-off in U.S. government debt, Bitcoin’s performance is gaining newfound attention from potential clients who shunned digital assets a year ago. Significantly, the TLT (iShares 20+ Year Treasuries, mkt cap $40B) ETF has fallen further, peak-to-now, than Bitcoin. Even the AGG (iShares Core U.S. Bond, mkt cap $90B) ETF now has a negative return over 5 years! Foreign central banks have been selling U.S. Treasuries and buying gold. Clients are increasingly asking if Bitcoin will be next. As the implications of G7 over-indebtedness become increasingly apparent to the average citizen and to America’s growing number of adversaries, we anticipate Bitcoin will thrive. Our observations in October revealed that crypto again demonstrated its strongest price performance during Asian trading hours. My hope remains that by introducing a harder standard of energy-backed money to the world, Bitcoin might absorb some of the entropy that alienates so many amidst so many polarizing issues. I found myself liking one tweet, which read: “ Separating money and state. Forget all else, this is the mission of Bitcoin. ” Whatever facts we disagree on, and there appears to be a greater number of them now, we trust the next Bitcoin block in ten minutes. I find that agreement profoundly valuable right now. Regrettably, many G7 administrations’ approach to tech innovation diverges significantly from certain fundamental principles core to free speech. President Biden's executive order on AI, reportedly influenced by his viewing of the Tom Cruise film 'Mission Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part I,' which features a sentient and rogue AI causing submarine havoc, seeks to regulate the act of solving mathematical problems in public, necessitating government registration beyond a certain threshold. In a parallel effort, Senator Elizabeth Warren is striving to introduce provisions into the essential National Defense Authorization Act that would subject crypto miners, validators, and wallet providers to the Bank Secrecy Act and KYC requirements, a proposition that many entities deem an impractical endeavor. Recent regulations in the EU, Canada, and the UK have placed considerable strain on the open internet, compelling platforms like Meta and others to curtail free news content and implement subscription models. Some of these regulations impose considerable fines for 'misinformation,” an infraction determined by diktat. Opposing such trends, many crypto investors look forward to a potential victory by pro-Bitcoin candidate Javier Milei in Argentina’s Presidential run-off on November 19th as a potential catalyst to remind the world that self-sovereign currencies can play a role at the sovereign level, too. Layer 1 Smart Contract Platforms Smart contract platform tokens rallied 11.1% in October, and the total market cap (ex Bitcoin) grew from $268B to $298B. The top performers were Solana (+79%) and Stacks (+30%), while the laggards for the month were Sui (-6%) and ATOM (+9%). October SCP DAU Gains Source: Artemis XYZ as of 10/31/2023.

The Ethereum ecosystem, including its L2 smart contract platforms, was again front and center in the October news cycle. On October 11, Ethereum saw its validator queue empty, indicating that there was no waiting line for new entities to stake ETH and become a validator for Ethereum. Although more than 14k validators joined the network in October, demand was insufficient to create a queue, and this is the first time since the Merge in September 2022 that this has occurred. Consequently, the Ethereum annualized staking rate reached its lowest level since the Merge on October 15th at 3.5% before rallying to end the month at 4.12% as prices rebounded. Meanwhile, the focus on L2 technology is heating up as zero-knowledge ((ZK)) L2 Zk Scroll launched on October 17th and has amassed $10.5M in TVL at the time of writing. Scroll joins existing zero knowledge L2 players Polygon zkEVM, Starkware, and ZkSync Era. To many in the crypto space, zk Layer-2s are a massive improvement over existing optimistic L2s like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base. Layer-2s that use zk technology post proofs of the transactions that occur on their L2 directly to Ethereum. By contrast, optimistic L2s post a batch of transactions to an L2 without proof of authenticity. As a result, another party can challenge the authenticity of optimistic L2 batches and force the L2 to reverse them if they are incorrect. The advantage of zk L2s is that they enable faster bridging back to Ethereum which can be accomplished in as little as 15 minutes. By contrast, optimistic L2s force a withdrawer to wait 7 days, the challenge period where someone can prove fraud, before they can move their assets off an L2. The tradeoff is that zk Layer-2s cost slightly more to users to transact upon due to the cost of posting large proofs to Ethereum. Long term, zk L2s believe transactions costs will be cheaper as the per-transaction cost will scale down with an increase in the volume of transactions. Daily Active Users zk Layer-2s Source: Artemis XYZ as of 10/31/2023. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Another interesting development for zk Layer-2s was the news that popular blockchains Canto and Astar will launch new networks through Polygon’s network of zk chains. Polygon also saw the stand-up of its new token to replace the MATIC token called POL. The token is part of Polygon’s shift to a zk-centric network, and the POL token, unlike the garishly named MATIC, will have inflation, which will be 2% per year. According to the Polygon team, half of the inflation will be used to invest in projects building on Polygon, while the other half will be allocated towards securing the network through validator payments. At its core. Polygon’s new zk approach is a fascinating new direction that could prove sagacious depending upon adoption of its new approach. Like Ethereum, Polygon is moving away from simply being a transaction execution environment and becoming a settlement layer. Additionally, though Starkware does not have a live token, the Israeli team announced in October that they would delay token unlocks for the future token from 11/29/2023 until 4/15/2024. Clearly, Starkware will be releasing its token in the near future. Not to be left behind, L2 Arbitrum came out with several announcements, including the anticipated launch of their Orbit project. This would allow Arbitrum to scale to more users by enabling developers to create L3 chains that settle their activity to Arbitrum. This would make Arbitrum into a settlement and execution layer similar to Ethereum. Arbitrum also announced its L3s would use Celestia as a data availability layer. Finally, Arbitrum concluded voting on its Short-Term Incentive Program ((STIP)) that allocates $50M worth of ARB tokens to various projects on Arbitrum’s chain. Big winners included Camelot, GMX, Dopex, Jones, and Galxe. Other Interesting News Items: Uniswap charging 0.15% on its frontend for trades. dYdX launching an app chain in the Cosmos.

Solana (+79%) Solana 30-Day MA of DEX Volumes vs TVL Source: Artemis XYZ as of 10/31/2023.Past performance is not indicative of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Solana’s SOL-USD (79.3+%) token washed away almost a year of bearish vibes with a much-welcome rally in October. In the aftermath of FTX immolation in November 2022, SOL’s price nosedived from the mid-$30 range in early November 2022 to trade as low as $8 on December 29, 2022. After FTX collapsed, the chief backer of Solana was consigned to the glue factory, and with Solana facing a flood of token unlocks, it was assumed that Solana would be joining FTX in the afterlife. Solana was seemingly left with an ecosystem in shambles as many projects lost funding while others saw their on-chain activity dwindle below economic sustainability. As a result of the death of these ventures, individuals, and entities who used Solana pulled their stablecoins that were on Solana, and the total market cap of stablecoins fell from $1.85B on Jan 1, 2023, to a low of $1.44B on October 17, 2023. Despite the flurry of bad news and languishing SOL price, Solana continued to innovate, as did projects in the Solana ecosystem. Interesting projects we like, including consumer-relevant applications such as Hivemapper, Render, and Helium, continue to attract users. Additionally, the Solana Foundation launched a programming interface for developers to create mobile phone applications for Solana called the Solana Mobile Stack, and Solana even launched its own phone. Coming into October, many investors were lukewarm on Solana due to the overhang of the FTX estate liquidating large chunks of tokens, investor token unlocks, and the popularity of Ethereum L2s that had TVLs surpass that of Solana’s. In mid-October, however, it was noticed that the FTX estate had staked 5.5M (out of the 58.9M they hold or will receive) Solana tokens worth $122M that many feared would be sold to pay be creditors. The positive news for Solana continued from there with the core Solana project called Squads, a multi-sig, inking a $5.7M VC raise, ensuring it ample runway to continue to provide its pivotal services on Solana. Activity for Solana also significantly picked up as usership increased, surging Solana fees by more than 18%. This uptick in activity helped drive Solana DeFi TVL to advance by 6%. At the same time, the narrative for yield generation from on-chain activity, including MEV using Solana liquid staking tokens (LSTs), also accelerated. Popular liquid staking and MEV facilitator Jito was the chief beneficiary of SOL LSTs, attracting a 70% increase in SOL. Another positive development for Solana in October included the introduction of an encrypted token standard that allows anyone to obscure balances of these tokens from other users. Given that Solana’s ecosystem is still recovering, it was also encouraging to see Solana Labs introduce a new incubator program for nascent Solana projects. For more on the potential of Solana, please see our recent deep-dive , including a financial model that anticipates up to $8B in revenues to SOL token-holders by 2030.

Stacks ( STX-USD , +34%) Stacks, a smart contract platform that rests upon the Bitcoin network and utilizes BTC, was the other largest winner in October, gaining (+34%). Part of this is undoubtedly because it is a leveraged play to the price of BTC, which had a blockbuster month (+24%), outperforming Ethereum. Curiously, activity on Stacks did not change much from September, measured by DEX volumes, daily transactions, or daily active addresses. However, while daily fees did increase by 60%, the average daily fee for October was only $200. TVL did grow meaningfully on Stacks as it rose from $13.8M at the beginning of the month to $25M as of October 27. Positive news included Digital asset custody firm Copper stating that it would integrate support for Stacks for Copper customers. Part of STX’s price fortune stems from the misfortunes of Stack’s competitors. In mid-October, a security researcher for the Lightning Network announced he had uncovered an attack vector for the Lightning Network that could cause the network to be halted. As a result, the researcher named Antoine Riard declared he would stop his work on the Lightning Network. However, others contend that the Lighting Network is safe, and as of October 27, BTC locked on the Lightning Network was at 5,920, which was up from 4,420 at the start of October. Sui ( SUI-USD ,-6%) Sui DAUs vs TVL Source: Artemis XYZ as of 10/31/2023. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Sui (-6%), despite initial early potential, has continued to languish as it fails to attract developers and users to its ecosystem. Compared to the month of September, the daily active users on Sui have fallen by (-55%). Though DEX volumes have increased by 240% and TVL has jumped by 87%, the increase in activity is overshadowed by high rewards inflation and investor token unlocks. The increase in floating tokens was 7.3% just for the month of October, as more than 67M tokens were added to the supply. This brings the total number of tokens to 906M. However, the token dilution becomes worse as time progresses due to an aggressive unlock schedule for early investors and team members. By this time next year, there will be 2.7B Sui tokens in circulation. Of that, around 1.05B will be in the hands of early investors of Sui. Facing a 3x supply overhang over the next year is a substantial burden that anyone token holder must reconcile no matter how vibrant Sui’s ecosystem becomes. In October, the token dilution issue came to a head as South Korean regulators accused the Sui Foundation of manipulating the supply of tokens. Though Sui denies the rumors of doing anything illegal, the South Korean Financial Supervisory Service announced that it would be launching an investigation into the distribution of the Sui token. Amid the negative news, Sui awarded over $1M in grants to programs building in its ecosystem. Additionally, they announced a new $51.3M ecosystem fund to support DeFi projects building on Sui. This development is particularly important given the lack of adoption by developers. Sui’s is programmed using Move, which is the same language as Aptos and very similar, because Move is based on Rust, to the language that Solana employs. The result is that Sui is directly competing with those other two ecosystems for developers. Solana, as an incumbent with a strong community identity, continues to maintain its developer share, but Sui could potentially catch up if its ecosystem stirs development interest. Sui Developer Market Share - SCP Monolithic Chains Source: Artemis XYZ as of 10/31/2023. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. ATOM ( ATOM-USD, +9%) Despite a mid-month rally alongside the rest of the SCP market, ATOM ended the month up only (+9%) amid continued concerns with its business model and how it will capture revenue from its ecosystem’s success. The key issue going forward is going to be the willingness of projects to come into the ATOM Economic Zone ((AEZ)) to lease security from ATOM’s Cosmos Hub blockchain. Though some important projects will be using ATOM for security, including Neutron, Stride, and Noble (eventually), many of the most vibrant projects in the Cosmos contend they will not use the Cosmos Hub. Though lack of Hub business success is not something new in October, it is a serious condition that is limiting Cosmos and could prove terminal to ATOM if things do not improve. Though the Cosmos ecosystem attracts the third most developers in crypto behind Polkadot and Ethereum, those figures are irrelevant to the Cosmos ATOM token until the Cosmos Hub is able to get other projects aligned with its needs. Another longstanding issue weighing on the ATOM’s price is concern over inflation. The ATOM token inflation rate is very high at 16.5% per year, and this is one of the highest among SCPs. Until these issues are resolved, ATOM will have great difficulty matching the performance of the Cosmos ecosystem or competitor blockchains. Despite the negative news for ATOM, there are some positive trends. Surprisingly, Cosmos had one of the best gains of users in October compared to September, with (+90%) in daily active users. Additionally, the Blockworks team and others are working on proposals to change ATOM’s tokenomics. These plans include focusing the Cosmos Hub’s business approach to other blockchains and reducing inflation of the Cosmos Hub. At the same time, two important projects launched in the Cosmos in October, and they could attract more interest in the Cosmos Hub. Celestia, the first of the new Data Availability blockchains, and dYdX, the dominant derivative DEX, both launched their mainets in October. Finally, earlier in the month, the Cosmos chain Noble launched native USDC in the Cosmos which will allow anyone to mint native USDC through the Noble chain and transport across the 64 active Cosmos chains. DeFi ( DPI-USD ) Volume Rising with the ‘Uptober’ Rally DEX Volume by Chain Source: DeFi Llama as of 10/31/2023. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. The MarketVector Decentralized Finance Leaders index (MVDFLE) recorded a 5.8% increase during the month, underperforming the rally in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Among the index components, UNI, MKR, and CRV underperformed significantly, returning -9%, -12%, and -9%, respectively. In contrast, ( AAVE-USD ), RUNE, and LDO rallied 19%, 47%, and 5%. The underperformance of DeFi as a whole is not surprising, considering the rally in digital assets was led by Bitcoin, and DeFi tokens typically trade better when ETH leads the market. Notably, the top-performing tokens in the index have established substantial dominance in their respective areas of the crypto market, with Aave being the largest lending market, Lido a clear winner in ETH liquid staking, and Thorchain ( RUNE-USD ) as the dominant decentralized exchange for native BTC and ETH swaps. Decentralized exchange (DEX) volume and the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi experienced significant reversals this month, with DeFi trading volume jumping 26% to $55.7 billion and the TVL across DeFi rising 8% to $41.7 billion. Arbitrum, Thorchain, and Solana experienced the largest surges in DEX volume, rising 53%, 146%, and 115%, respectively. The relative outperformance in DEX volumes across these chains suggests that they are becoming the preferred chains for trading digital assets outside of Ethereum. Thorchain (RUNE) performed exceptionally well this month due to its dominant position as the most decentralized protocol for swapping native BTC and ETH. The decentralized exchange saw its volume more than double from September to $2.46 billion as investors flocked to acquire Bitcoin, anticipating the tailwinds from a potential U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF and the upcoming Bitcoin halving. While Thorchain’s decentralization comes with a few regulatory concerns, such as the FTX exploiter using the protocol to exchange stolen funds, investors seemed ultimately unconcerned as they rushed to buy RUNE this month. AAVE Monthly Revenue Source: Token Terminal as of 10/31/2023. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Aave Surges on Increased Demand for Leverage and Rising Revenue Aave outperformance this month was driven by a short squeeze on centralized exchanges that led to the liquidation of over $2 million in short positions within a span of three days, alongside positive fundamental growth. Moreover, investors may be strategically positioning themselves in AAVE due to several fundamental factors favoring the protocol. With the recent upsurge in crypto market volatility, Aave is poised to bolster its daily revenue through the liquidation of overleveraged users and the heightened demand for stablecoins, often signaling the onset of a cryptocurrency bull market. As the predominant lending protocol in DeFi, the borrow rate for USDC on Aave serves as a valuable indicator of the market's appetite for leverage. Users typically deposit their favorite digital assets as collateral and borrow USDC to increase their exposure. During the bear market, the borrow rate for USDC on Aave remained at approximately 4%. However, it has surged to 12% on the V3 market and 19% on V2, signifying that on-chain investors are leveraging their exposure to volatile digital assets in anticipation of a bull market. Aave's daily revenue has surged in tandem with higher borrow rates. According to Token Terminal, Aave's monthly revenue has more than doubled since the start of the year, rising to $1.8 million this month. Uniswap Labs Implements Frontend Fee Uniswap Labs Interface Fee Source: The Block as of 10/30/2023. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. In the middle of the month, Uniswap Labs made the decision to impose a 0.15% swap fee on transactions conducted via their Uniswap front end and within the Uniswap Wallet. This fee applies to swaps involving ETH, USDC, WETH, USDT, DAI, WBTC, agEUR, GUSD, LUSD, EUROC, and XSGD as both the input and output tokens, excluding swaps between stablecoins. Since its introduction, the frontend has collected $631k in fees, indicating a potential annual revenue of over $15 million for Uniswap Labs. This move has generated discontent within the community, as some perceive it as a signal that Uniswap Labs prioritizes enhancing the value of their equity over promoting value accrual to the Uniswap token. The reason why Uniswap Labs could want to do this despite owning a large amount of UNI is that driving value to the token could be accompanied with regulatory scrutiny if it leads to the UNI token being deemed an unregistered security. The community's dissatisfaction is rooted in a prolonged debate spanning several years regarding the activation of the ""fee switch"" to generate revenue from liquidity provider earnings on the Uniswap protocol. Back in June, the Uniswap DAO nearly voted to activate the fee switch, but the vote ultimately failed due to regulatory apprehensions from venture capital teams holding significant UNI tokens and Uniswap Labs equity. The contentious nature of this debate contributed to the underperformance of the UNI token during crypto’s rally in October. $FRAX Market Capitalization Source: Coingecko as of 10/31/2023. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. sFRAX: Bringing Real World Asset Yield to the Frax Protocol Frax Finance is following in the footsteps of MakerDAO by introducing a staking product for their FRAX stablecoin, known as sFRAX. Utilizing the non-profit entity established by the DAO, FinResPBC, the Frax DAO can now custody Real World Assets (RWAS) off-chain and offer users a yield on sFRAX just below the Interest Rate on Reserve Balances (IORB). Currently, sFRAX has seen a decent amount of adoption, with the amount of FRAX deposited surpassing 44 million. While the strong early growth is a good sign for sFRAX, it is still only a fraction of the amount that Maker has seen deposited into sDAI, which boosted DAI’s market capitalization by 20% and stands today at around $1.5 billion in deposits. While sFRAX shares similarities with sDAI, there are key distinctions. Notably, MakerDAO's governance dictates the yield earned by sDAI holders via the Enhanced DAI Savings Rate (DSR), which decreases the effective yield for depositors as the DSR utilization increases. Currently, Maker's DSR has a utilization rate of around 30%, meaning nearly one-third of all DAI is deposited in the DSR and receiving yield payouts from MakerDAO. However, once the utilization rate reaches 35%, the yield for depositors will decline to 4.32% and remain at that level even if utilization decreases back to below 35%. In contrast, the yield for sFRAX depositors is solely based on the IORB rate, adjusted slightly lower (0.05%-0.1%) to account for fees related to capital movement between RWAs and on-chain assets. Notably, this ensures that the yield for sFRAX depositors remains unaffected by the actions of other investors but only by fluctuations in short-term interest rates. Consequently, it's likely that sFRAX will become a more capital-efficient means of capturing yield over the long term compared to sDAI. If Maker's rates decrease and the benefits of switching from sDAI to sFRAX become more apparent, we may witness a transition of investors towards holding sFRAX. Blur Captures Market Share as NFT Volume Stagnates Monthly NFT Volume Stagnates While Crypto Rallies Source: Cryptoslam as of 10/31/2023. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. NFT volume saw a small but insignificant increase this month, rising only $7 million to $306 million. Despite the poor volume of the overall NFT market, Blur made strides in market share, with volume this month growing to $132 million, excluding wash sales and its share of the Ethereum NFT exchange marketplace rising to over 60% from 55%. The rise in volume on Blur was influenced by the upcoming end of season 2 farming rewards on November 20th, which will see over 300 million Blur airdropped to users of the protocol. The airdrop gained significant value this month as the price of BLUR rallied 31% on the announcement of a governance proposal to enable a fee on the exchange’s volume. After some discussion by the community, it appears that the DAO will likely vote on whether or not to enable a 0.5% fee on volume. Additionally, the fee would likely be accompanied by a locking mechanism, which would help to sink many of the tokens that will be distributed in the season 2 airdrop and dissuade farmers from dumping them on the market. Those who have voiced their opinions against the proposal have indicated that it could lead to Blur losing its dominant market share, while community members in support have highlighted that there is no utility or value accrual to BLUR and progress on this front needs to be made to support the token valuation. After BLUR’s strong rally this month, it would appear that the market agrees with the latter. For context, if this fee had been applied to both Blur’s exchange and lending volume over the last month, it would have generated just under $2 million in cash flow for the DAO, which could then be used for token buybacks and distributed to owners who lock their tokens. SoFi: Friend.Tech Maintains Market Dominance as Whale Dumps Keys and Top Competitor Suffers Exploit Volume Share Among SoFi Platforms Source: DUNE: @Cryptokoryo as of 10/29/23. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Friend.Tech continued to capture the majority of Social Finance ((SOFI)) volume this month while competitors suffered from exploits and lack of usership. At the start of the month, StarsArena was exploited for ~$3 million AVAX due to a re-entrancy bug. However, the team was able to recoup the funds from the exploiter (minus a 10% whitehat bounty) and relaunch the platform by mid-month. Upon relaunch, StarsArena was able to gain back some market share from Friend.Tech, but it has consistently receded since and never exceeded its all-time high market share of volume that it achieved on its initial launch. In previous recaps, we have mentioned how the illiquidity of Friend.Tech keys will lead to substantial price movements as users exit the protocol. This was made evident this month when one of the top accounts on the platform, Vombatus.eth, dumped 176 of their own keys for 851 ETH, or about $1.5 million. This sent the price of Vombatus.eth keys from around 8.3 ETH each to 1.7 ETH, an 80% drawdown. We believe that there is a high possibility that the same heightened volatility that initially attracted users to Friend.Tech could also catalyze their exit as users look to capitalize on the massive appreciation many of the Friend.Tech keys have experienced. As it stands today, Friend.Tech has been able to onboard 832k unique buyers who have traded over $23 million of keys on the protocol. Friend.Tech’s continued dominance in the SoFi market suggests that its ability to capture a large number of users early and promises of a future airdrop have provided a strong enough moat to retain users at least until the airdrop has commenced. Gaming and Metaverse Tokens Outperform Despite Low Adoption The MarketVector Media and Entertainment Leaders index (MVMELE) finished the month up 14.8%, slightly underperforming Bitcoin but outperforming ETH by a considerable margin as investors speculated on the low market capitalization tokens, which can provide higher upside in a bull market rally. Of the index components, GALA, AXS, and MANA received the most attention, returning 32%, 17%, and 16%, respectively. APE and SAND underperformed the rest of the index, returning only 5.6% and 9% throughout the month. While GALA and MANA had no clear catalysts this month to explain their performance, the AXS rally was likely supported by Game Jam 2023, an event where independent game developers were invited to create and submit games to be included in the Axie Infinity universe. Axie Infinity currently attracts about 300k monthly active players, which is still only a fraction of the ~3 million monthly active users it boasted in the bull market before being hacked. While the outperformance of metaverse and gaming tokens was impressive, keep in mind that GALA, AXS, and MANA are still down from their peaks of 98%, 96%, and 93%, respectively. Web3 Gaming Investment Source: DappRadar as of 10/31/2023. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. The outperformance of metaverse and gaming tokens indicates that investors still believe in the potential of a blockchain-based metaverse in the future, which is supported by a report from DappRadar indicating that $600m in investment flowed into Web3 gaming in Q3. However, the Web3 gaming space has continued to see lackluster adoption throughout the bear market as multiple AAA games were promised in 2023 but have not yet been released, such as Illuvium and Shrapnel. Additionally, the top metaverse platforms continue to see low monthly usership, with The Sandbox and Decentraland only attracting 12.5k and 3.2k unique users in October. With this in mind, it would appear that the outperformance was likely due to traders speculating ahead of a potential bull market run rather than any real fundamental change in value. Gaming and metaverse tokens have historically been highly speculative, and since the move was not supported by any large fundamental improvements in the tokenomics of these projects, we think it is likely they will underperform during consolidation periods with brief spikes in outperformance until greater adoption is seen and clear winners emerge. Circle Partners with FamilyMart and BitoGroup to launch “Points-to-Crypto” in Taiwan USDC Market Capitalization Source: Coingecko as of 10/31/2023. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Near the end of the month, Circle (the company that issues USDC) announced a partnership with the second-largest convenience store chain in Taiwan, FamilyMart, and the leading cryptocurrency exchange in Taiwan BitoGroup, to provide FamilyMart customers with the ability to exchange loyalty points for USDC. According to the announcement, Taiwan has one of the highest densities of convenience stores, making loyalty points at these shops extremely significant for the daily consumer. By providing the ability to redeem loyalty points for USDC, consumers will be able to avoid the depreciation of loyalty points and use their rewards to purchase a much wider range of goods as they are no longer limited to accessing the value of their points purely through items sold by FamilyMart. Additionally, the partnership should help bolster the circulating supply of USDC, which has been hammered during the bear market and is down 55% from the all-time high. Circle previously announced a partnership with Grab App, a super-app in Southeast Asia with over 130 million users. The latest partnership with FamilyMart highlights Circle’s continued effort to get their stablecoin integrated with more retail-facing applications, as well as the growing adoption of Web3 technology in Asia.

Ethereum To Surpass $14,000 By 2030? The price of Ethereum has been on a fairly positive sentiment since the news of BlackRock’s Ethereum Spot ETF filing news. The cryptocurrency saw a spike that took its price above $2000 this week. Industry specialists from Finder, an independent comparison platform and information service have stated that Ethereum will continue experiencing a price increase in the coming years. Related Reading: Ethereum Daily Revenue Soars To A 4-Month High Of $10 Million The comparison platform has predicted that Ethereum would drop to $1,840 by the end of 2023 and Ethereum’s price at the time of writing is $2,060.8. Crypto specialists at Finder also expect Ethereum’s value to increase to $5,824 by 2025 and $14,411 by 2030. The financial information service platform has stated that the reason for this price prediction is due to Ethereum’s huge growth potential and the increasing demand for Ethereum staking. Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $2,060. Chart: TradingView.com Lead Market Analyst at Swyftx, Pav Hundal has supported Ethereum’s price increase prediction. Hundal stated that the upcoming Bitcoin halving in 2024 may push the cryptocurrency’s price up, as historical patterns have suggested a potential upward movement for Ethereum’s value during past Bitcoin halving events. “Historically, as we approach a Bitcoin halving, Ethereum tends to revisit its price valuations from earlier that year. This trend aligns with the repeated observation that Bitcoin’s dominance (proportion of the total [crypto] market capitalization) swells as we near the halving event. We can anticipate that there will be a potential shift from altcoins [like ETH] back into Bitcoin in the lead-up to the halving,” Hundal stated. Finder Experts Say BTC Still Holds Upper Hand Despite the positive outlook of Ethereum’s price in the future by Finder’s crypto experts, a large majority of Finder’s specialists have expressed skepticism about Ethereum’s market capitalization surpassing that of Bitcoin. When asked if they saw ETH’s market cap “flipping” BTCs, 43% of the expert panelists remained unconvinced that Ethereum would overtake Bitcoin. Creator of Seasonal Tokens, Ruadhan O. has stated that he believed that Ethereum’s utility surpassed Bitcoin’s however he does not see ETH’s market cap surpassing BTC’s. He explained that his reasons were due to Ethereum’s high competition with other altcoins in the crypto market.

Over the past week, the cryptocurrency maintained its recent positive momentum, reaching a new yearly high of $15.8 on Thursday, November 9. A crypto analyst and trader who predicted this latest bullish run has offered more insight on what to expect from the Chainlink token. What’s Next For LINK Price? A crypto analyst with the pseudonym Mags took to X (formerly Twitter) to share an interesting update on the LINK price action. While referring to their initial analysis, the crypto analyst predicted the likely movement of Chainlink’s price over the coming days. $LINK broke out and went vertical without any re-test as said in my previous update!

The crypto trader then forecasted a straight rally to $12.54, a level the altcoin had surpassed earlier this week. Related Reading: Solana Breaks Past $54 On Steady Price Momentum – Will SOL Hit $60 This Month? From the current standpoint, Mags believes that the LINK price will continue its “vertical” upward run without any re-test. “Expecting one more leg up till $18 before any HTF pullback,” the crypto analyst postulated in their post on X. As of this writing, the LINK token is valued at $15.06, reflecting more than a 3.6% price increase in the past 24 hours. While the altcoin’s price has been moving mostly sideways in the last few days, it has maintained most of its gains in the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, the Chainlink token has swelled by more than 33% over the past seven days. This figure underscores the altcoin’s position as one of the best performers in the crypto market over the last few months. Chainlink’s Whale Activity Hits Six-Month High A recent on-chain data report by blockchain analytics firm Santiment revealed that whale activity on the Chainlink network had hit its highest level in six months. Interestingly, the network is not alone in this trend, as other blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano, have also experienced a similar spike in whale activity.

20045472,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560210,1699691484,Solana Breaks Past $54 On Steady Price Momentum – Will SOL Hit $60 This Month?,"Solana is distinguishing itself in the crypto market, with a remarkable 50% monthly gain and an extraordinary 450% year-to-date increase, contributing to the overall surge in optimism. This trend is further amplified by Bitcoin’s ascent beyond $37,000 and its ambitious aim to reach $40,000 by year-end. Solana’s standout performance adds a notable dimension to the current positive sentiment prevailing in the cryptocurrency space. In an early morning rally, Solana broke the $50 barrier, marking its highest point since May 22, 2022. This exceptional performance underscores growing confidence in the crypto space, with Solana’s breakout signaling its prominence in the current market rally. Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) Poised For A Bullish Surge, Analyst Who Predicted 2021 Fall Says The huge increase in the price of SOL can be ascribed to the significant advancement of BlackRock’s application for an Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). This observation signifies an increasing acknowledgment and approval of assets built on the Ethereum platform, which in turn contributes to the favorable trajectory of the overall cryptocurrency market and has a specific influence on the performance of Solana. Solana: Navigating The FTX Liquidation Wave And Post-Conference Surge In particular, this upsurge also transpired during the ongoing liquidation of SOL tokens by the bankruptcy estate of FTX. Just this September, the Delaware Bankruptcy Court granted approval for the disposal of the assets of the defunct exchange, comprising 55.75 million SOL. Following its annual conference, Solana saw an impressive price spike that demonstrated its durability in the face of uncertainty surrounding FTX Group, a major SOL token holder that is currently experiencing financial turmoil. SOL market cap at $22.7 billion on the weekend chart: TradingView.com SOL’s increasing trajectory looks to favor FTX creditors notwithstanding FTX’s contradictory declarations regarding its investment. SOL’s current trading range may be able to recover the losses incurred by FTX exchange users, according to Thomas Braziel, CEO of 117 Partners. The Founder of FTX Group, Sam Bankman-Fried, is facing legal action for allegedly embezzling client monies, which is why this is happening. Solana Enjoys Sustained Upward Trajectory Meanwhile, Jacob Canfield, a well-known figure in the realm of cryptocurrency trading, has provided an analysis elucidating his belief in the continued upward trajectory of the Solana price surge. Canfield expressed his belief that Solana is poised to maintain its position as one of the most influential entities in the ongoing bull market cycle. In my opinion, I think that @Solana is going to continue to be one of the biggest movers during this current bull market cycle and I’m going to lay out some ideas for you. It’s possible that with the Ethereum ETF news that some of these ideas don’t play out, but it’s worth… pic.twitter.com/oii8vWs0W9 — Jacob Canfield (@JacobCanfield) November 9, 2023 In another development, the declining trend of Solana’s total value locked (TVL), reflecting the amount deposited in its smart contracts, has reversed after six consecutive weeks. In the last three days alone, Solana’s DApps deposits have experienced a 10% increase. Although the current level of 11.1 million SOL remains below the pre-FTX exchange bankruptcy level of 30 million SOL, this recent upward trend indicates that the Solana network may have passed its worst period. SOL TVL. Source: DefiLlama In the upcoming days, the trajectory remains dynamic and uncertain as the intricate dance between bulls and bears unfolds. A substantial downturn could be in the cards for Solana if the bears persist, testing a critical support at $38.77 within the current month. On the flip side, failure to sustain prices above $54.01 and a bearish takeover may lead to a loss of momentum, resulting in a descent to the $46.83 support level. However, should the bulls maintain control and keep the price above $54.01, the market is positioned for a robust upswing, potentially challenging the $57.84 resistance. Furthermore, a breakthrough past the $60.06 mark could pave the way for a sustained rally towards the upper resistance of $65.08. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Chart Described As ‘Beautiful’ By Crypto Analyst Will SOL Reach $60 This November? As Solana breaks past the $54 mark, anticipation looms over whether SOL will surge to $60 within the current month. The recent momentum shift and positive trends in total value locked (TVL) and DApps deposits suggest an optimistic outlook for Solana. Investors are closely monitoring the developments, eager to see if the cryptocurrency can maintain its upward trajectory. The coming days hold the key to whether Solana will achieve the $60 milestone, marking a significant chapter in its market performance.

20037656,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560199,1699675250,XRP Price Outlook: Expert Forecasts Potential Rise To $5.5,"In the evolving cryptocurrency market, XRP, currently ranked as the fifth largest digital asset, has recently exhibited a modest price increase compared to its major counterparts. However, when examining XRP’s performance across various time frames, the token has reported significant gains. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that XRP is currently trading well below its yearly high, in contrast to its peers who have achieved and surpassed new highs in 2023 during the recent bullish surge. Impending XRP Price Breakout? Prominent industry expert using the pseudonym “Crypto Insight” on the X platform (formerly known as Twitter) shared an intriguing update with his over 20,000 followers, signaling an impending XRP blastoff. According to Crypto Insight, it becomes apparent that XRP tends to lag behind the price action of Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency. However, there are indications that XRP breakouts are gradually converging with the movements of BTC. Related Reading: Algorand (ALGO) NFT Rewards Skyrocket: Transactions Surge 320% In Q3 Analyzing historical data, Crypto Insight highlights that the time taken for XRP to experience significant breakouts has been decreasing over time. The first major breakout took approximately 22 days, while the most recent pump occurred within a shorter time frame of 13 days. If this trend of closing the gap between XRP and BTC continues, it suggests a potential breakout date around November 15th. Additionally, XRP has undergone a cooling-off period in the 4-hour time frame, implying that there might be further room for a downside correction before a reversal to the upside occurs. Crypto Analyst Targets $5.5 Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has recently unveiled a noteworthy forecast for XRP, centering around the Multi-Year Ascending Triangle (MYAT) pattern, which holds significant implications for XRP’s price movements. According to Egrag’s analysis, The MYAT pattern indicates that XRP experienced a breakout above the Symmetrical Triangle after reaching the 70% completion mark, which aligns with the timeline of July on the chart. Related Reading: What Is Shiba Inu: An Explainer And SHIB Price Prediction The surge in price to $0.93 and the subsequent retest at the breakout point are seen as part of a standard retest process, indicating potential strength in the upward momentum. Looking ahead, Egarg Crypto highlights several key projections for XRP: XRP appears to be poised to reach a target of $1.3, as indicated by the Blue Ascending Triangle on the chart. This level represents a significant milestone that XRP could potentially achieve in the near future. The next notable move for XRP could potentially propel it to $5.5. However, it is important to note that at this price level, a considerable selloff by retail investors is anticipated, according to Egrag. Building upon the larger symmetrical triangle pattern, Egarg Crypto suggests that XRP could see a remarkable 500% price increase in the future, indicating the potential for a substantial pump. Currently, XRP is grappling with the challenge of establishing consolidation above the crucial $0.600 level, which holds significant implications for the cryptocurrency’s future price uptrend and overall prospects. In the past 30 days, XRP has recorded a gain of 35%. However, the sustainability of this price action for the anticipated second leg up in November remains uncertain.

20035892,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560182,1699671645,Ethereum Daily Revenue Soars To A 4-Month High Of $10 Million,"When Ethereum (ETH) exploded past $2,000 on November 9, Erik Smith, the Chief Investment Officer of 401 Capital, observed that the platform’s average daily revenue surged to the highest level in four months. According to data, Ethereum generated $10 million in daily revenue, extending gains registered on the previous day and pushing the metric to the highest point since July. Ethereum Prices Above $2,000, Revenue Rising In November For now, ETH prices remain muted but are trading around November 9 highs and remain within a bullish formation backed by decent trading volumes. Prices are still trending above the $2,000 psychological support, a critical reaction level. A look at the Ethereum candlestick arrangement in the daily chart shows that while there is a notable spike in daily revenue, prices are still below July 2023 highs. Then, the coin soared to as high as $2,100 before pulling back as the momentum triggered by the broader crypto’s expectation of a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) approval faded. However, prices have since sharply recovered, adding roughly 40% from October lows and shaking off the weakness registered on August 17 when the coin plunged by 14%. Related Reading: $5 Million Reward: Justin Sun’s Bold Move Against Poloniex Attackers Token Terminal data shows that Ethereum’s daily revenue has steadily risen in the first ten days of November. Looking at trends, the average daily income has doubled from $5 million in the first five days of the month. Usually, an uptick in daily average revenue in a network points to increasing on-chain activity either through smart contract deployment or simple transfers, which necessitates the payment of gas fees. Improving Scalability In The Long Term How the widespread adoption of Ethereum layer-2 and sidechain scaling solutions will impact the network revenue is not immediately apparent. } What’s clear is that the more protocols leverage the protocol, deploying multiple solutions, the more revenue the network will generate for validators and stakers. Staking rewards are drawn partly from transaction fees paid as gas, new issuance, and burned miner extractable value (MEV). Still, the dollar value of ETH minted as revenue depends on spot rates. If the uptrend is sustained, this figure will continue expanding. Even so, there might be more demand for the network, which is still struggling to scale on-chain.

SEC: Epic Battle Unfolds Over $770M Disgorgement Demand,"In a recent interview with CNBC, Brad Garlinghouse addressed the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the classification of XRP. Garlinghouse highlighted three consecutive wins for Ripple in the legal proceedings, emphasizing that the first judgment on July 13 clearly stated that XRP is not a security. He also mentioned denying the court’s interlocutory appeal and dismissing allegations against Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen and himself. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse Criticizes SEC’s Regulatory Approach In the interview, Garlinghouse criticized the SEC’s approach to regulation by enforcement and lawsuit patterns, stating that the SEC needs to step back and realize that their actions are deviating from its mission to protect investors. Garlinghouse questioned who the SEC is truly protecting in this journey and called for a change in their regulatory approach. Related Reading: $5 Million Reward: Justin Sun’s Bold Move Against Poloniex Attackers Commenting on the exchange-traded funds (ETFs) currently awaiting approval, Garlinghouse acknowledged that an approved ETF could bring significant capital to the market. However, Brad emphasized that regulatory clarity, utility, and scalable problem-solving are essential for the industry to thrive. Garlinghouse expressed his optimism for the industry’s future, citing macro catalysts that will propel it forward in the next five to ten years. Pro-XRP Lawyer Challenges SEC’s $770M Disgorgement Demand In a separate development, pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton chimed in on X (formerly Twitter), stating that Ripple would not come close to paying the $770 million disgorgement demanded by the SEC. Deaton argued that the SEC’s claim for disgorgement related to XRP sales in the UK, Japan, Switzerland, and other jurisdictions is flawed. He pointed out that XRP is deemed a non-security in those jurisdictions and was considered a legal exchange/utility token. Deaton questioned the SEC’s attempt to disgorge sales made in those jurisdictions and emphasized that the Court’s goal is not to punish Ripple as this is not a fraud case. Deaton further explained that the disgorgement amount would be significantly reduced after deducting non-US sales, sales to accredited investors and considering the minimal harm caused by ODL (On-Demand Liquidity) transactions. Deaton highlighted that a petition filed by 75,000 XRP holders claimed that the SEC, not Ripple, was causing harm, further bolstering Ripple’s position. Related Reading: MicroStrategy’s $4.6 Billion Bitcoin Bet Pays Off, Here’s How Much It’s Worth Now The remarks made by Brad Garlinghouse and John Deaton underscore the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC, with Ripple asserting its stance on XRP’s classification and criticizing the SEC’s regulatory approach. The outcome of this high-profile case will likely have significant implications for the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. As of the time of writing, XRP is currently trading at $0.660, exhibiting a sideways price movement and consolidating above this crucial level. Despite the lack of significant upward or downward movement, the token has experienced substantial gains amidst the recent bullish reversal in the market.

Ethereum’s Price Supported By Latest Developments The Ethereum’s price surge can be traced back to several factors that have propelled the cryptocurrency’s growth. The asset reached its 52-week high of $2,137 on Thursday, November 9, as seen in the chart below. Related Reading: Ethereum At $2,100: Why Path To $2,500 Is Now All Clear One of the factors that has contributed to the crypto asset’s price surge is the number of ETH staked. A rise in ETH staked, which stood at over 28 million, according to data from Beaconscan. As of August, the number of validators in the Beacon Chain was approximately 786,000, but today that number is currently at 884,000. This indicates confidence in Ethereum’s long-term stability, which can be promising to investors. In addition, the token’s on-chain volume has also increased significantly over time.

This news is a curious development, especially for OP Mainnet, the team behind one of the most popular Ethereum layer-2 scaling solutions, and OP token holders. Billions Of OP Not Assigned Token Unlocks notes that roughly 2.4 billion OP, representing 55% of the max supply, remains under the TBD allocation. So far, over 831 million OP, or slightly above 19% of the max supply, have been unlocked. This revelation also comes when OP prices have been trending higher, breezing past crucial resistance levels. At spot rates, OP is changing hands above September and October highs, temporarily retesting October highs. The bull bar of November 10 anchors the current leg up since it was accompanied by relatively high trading volume. Token Unlocks defines a TBD allocation as not assigned a release timing but will be subject to community voting. These tokens can be distributed for governance, Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroGPF), ecosystem funding, moved to advisers or partners, and much more. RetroGPF is a funding mechanism that allows the protocol to support projects building solutions on its general-purpose layer-2 platform. Since it is retroactive, projects or developers don’t have to apply for funding in advance. Related Reading: Is A Bearish Reversal Coming For Bitcoin? This Metric May Warn So Usually, token unlocking releases coins initially locked or vested for a given time. Projects tend to employ this tactic to align the incentives of investors and that of the team. This also concurrently prevents early adopters from mass selling the coin, driving prices lower. Even so, since all specified unlocks are done publicly, transparency allows investors or traders to make informed decisions. What Will Happen To OP Prices? For the token’s Mainnet’s case, a big chunk of the max supply remains unassigned at spot rates, which is, as it is, supportive of prices. However, once these tokens are voted for, and the community decides the portion of the maximum supply that can, for instance, be distributed to advisers or used to fund ecosystem projects, then there is a tendency for prices to fall as the unlock date approaches. According to L2Beat, OP Mainnet is the second largest layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum after Arbitrum One. OP Mainnet has a total value locked (TVL) of $3.39 billion, commanding a market share of 25%. Meanwhile, Base, a competitor backed by Coinbase, is third with a TVL of $600 million.
