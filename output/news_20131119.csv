42376711,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cktf,1384899337,"Bitcoin Could be Regulated as a Commodity, Senate Banking Hearing Advised","View the full video of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs hearing on virtual currencies here.  Bitcoin could be regulated as a commodity if market volatility continues, academics and financial industry players warned at a Senate hearing today.  Speaking at a subcommittee hearing organized by the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, a representative from a financial industry technology round table also called for more regulation for virtual currencies.  Sarah Jane Hughes  , university scholar and fellow in commercial law at Indiana University Maurer School of Law, argued that bitcoin may need to be regulated as a commodity or security, based on its market behaviour.  “Bitcoin prices seemingly move separately from the values of the world’s major currencies,” she said. “If other virtual currencies demonstrate this market freedom from legal tender currencies, this may be the signal that a reconsideration of type of regulation to be applied from regulation as payment systems to regulation as commodities or securities.”  Hughes wasn’t the only one talking up potential commodities regulation for virtual currencies.Mercedes Kelley Tunstall, partner and practice leader for the Privacy and Data Security Group at Ballard Spahr LLP, argued that virtual currencies “either need to comply with or protect against commoditization”.  “Unless the next generation of virtual currencies can resolve the question as to whether virtual currency should be considered a commodity, the industry will remain characterized by volatility,” she said, adding that this would hinder mainstream adoption.  Market volatility  Paul Smocer  , the President of BITS, the technology policy division of the Financial Services Roundtable, also highlighted market volatility risk for bitcoin, and was particularly vocal in calling for more regulation. Other than the FinCEN guidance in March, virtual currency firms have virtually no existing regulatory oversight, said Smocer, whose organization was founded by large financial services firms.  He said:    “Without regulations, these digital currencies are not providing appropriate consumer protections to ensure individuals understand the risks much less are protected in ways we now take for granted.      While the digital currency market seems ripe for further oversight and regulation, the act of regulating it, in and of itself, adds legitimacy to the market.”    Hughes steadfastly opposed any special treatment of virtual currency companies by creating regulations specifically for them.  “The ‘don’t regulate us or you will stifle innovation’ arguments did not persuade many as digital money, prepaid cards, payroll cards and other new products appeared in markets and they offer no reason to abandon existing prudential regulation now,” she warned.  She also warned against creating a single licensing scheme covering both state and federal licensing. “It is not clear to me that early applicants will enjoy the relief from 50-state regulation that they seem to expect,” she warned.  [post-quote]  David Cotney  , Commissioner of Banks for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, also worried about the risks of virtual currencies, pointing particularly to real time losses and “other destabilizing effects”.  Cotney spoke on behalf of the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS), where he is vice-chair. The CSBS unites all 50 state banking regulators in the US. However, it is still trying to characterize virtual currency, he said.  “State agencies would be negligent in their responsibilities if they simply allowed the push of technological innovation to preempt the need to apply the law in a thorough and deliberate manner,” he warned, pointing to New York as an example of a state that was taking steps to try and regulate the currency. Hughes also said that she was “delighted” by the discussion over BitLicenses in New York State.  Privacy  Hughes, who also called for an in-depth Federal Reserve study into virtual currencies, also warned about the anonymity of virtual currencies. Instead of “condoning” virtual currency systems that market the anonymity of their users, they should be handled under existing financial privacy guidelines – specifically, the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978, which governs access to account and transaction information of individuals and businesses by the federal government.  They could also fall under Title V (Privacy) of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Act of 1999, which governs how providers of consumer financial products and services may use and share the non-public, personally identifiable information they hold, she asserted.  However, Hughes admitted that these regulations have their privacy limits, particularly in the area of border seizures, and Title 18 forfeiture.  Although FinCEN updated its guidance on virtual currencies in March, Hughes said that banks still needed more clarity if they are to be persuaded to deal with virtual currency companies.  The agency must clarify how anti-money-laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) policies apply to virtual currencies, as “this is one of the few ways in which we can stop the recent spate of terminations of banking relationships with providers of virtual currencies”. Virtual currency firms should be made to follow the same AML and KYC rules that traditional financial institutions do, she said.  For all the regulatory grandstanding, there were at least some conciliatory overtones. Hughes, unlike Smocer, advised lawmakers not to step up regulatory efforts – at least for now. She said:  “My answer is not yet, and not until such time as stronger evidence suggests problems exist with these currencies that contribute to financial instabilities, or otherwise enable issuers or intermediaries to commit fraud on users or complicate monetary or other important public policies.""  Hughes also called for payment issuers in the virtual currency space to make up their own rules, in an attempt to preclude regulatory interference.  “I encourage virtual currency issuers to create payment systems rules for their own systems and harbor some hope that issuers will compete to offer system rules that match the needs of the individuals and businesses who participate,” she said.  One such payment systems company is BitPay. CEO Tony Gallippi also presented, and argued against regulation. He recommended that Congress take the same approach to bitcoin as they did to the commercial Internet in the early nineties: wait and see.  “If America is the leader in Bitcoin technology, America will create more jobs and more exports,” he said. “If the United States doesn’t allow our businesses to accept bitcoin and create more jobs and exports, then countries like Germany and China certainly will.”  He understood why banks might be nervous about virtual currencies, though, as it is a disruptive technology, which threatens to undermine their business models. “With bitcoin, users can handle many of their daily payments needs themselves and avoid the bank fees, so banks relying on fee revenue could be impacted the most by virtual currencies,” said Gallippi.  Gallippi also talked up bitcoin’s potential as a mechanism for trading smart property. “By reporting deeds and titles on the block chain, the information would be public record forever, for pennies, and eliminate the need for title insurance,” he said.

42376726,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cl8l,1384878058,Bitcoin Price Skyrockets as Senate Hearing Concludes,"The price of bitcoin spiked dramatically last night and the transaction volume on the Bitcoin protocol (in USD) eclipsed that of Western Union.  The spike took place after Jerry Brito, Patrick Murck and Jeremy Allaire presented their testimonies on bitcoin and the future of virtual currencies to the Homeland Security and Governmental affairs committee in the US senate at the Senate hearing titled Beyond Silk Road: Potential Risks, Threats and Promises of Virtual Currencies.  The CoinDesk BPI read $650 on conclusion of the hearings, with Mt. Gox reporting a jump to $750 and, later, BTC China reaching a record high of 6,989 CNY (approximately $1,147) before crashing to almost 60% of this value in seconds, and then recovering to about $850. At the time of writing, the CoinDesk BPI puts the price at $602.  The senate hearing is being hailed as an historic moment for bitcoin, with even Ben Bernanke, current chairman of the Federal Reserve remarking that virtual currencies ""may hold long term promise"" in an open letter to Senator Thomas Carper (D) published 12th November.  At the hearing, Senator Carper listened to commentary, criticism and praise of bitcoin with a temperament that left many in the bitcoin community impressed and even delighted, whilst Jennifer Shaskey Calvery from FinCEN was measured in her analysis and assessment of the promises and threats that virtual currencies present.  This morning, data analysis website Coinometrics reported that bitcoin passed Western Union in daily transaction volume, transacting an average of $245m compared with Western Union's estimated $216m but is still behind on the average number of daily transactions at approximately 62,000, with Western Union clocking up approximately 633,000 transactions per day by comparison.  Commenters on reddit are quick to point out, however, that comparing these two networks is like comparing apples and oranges, as Western Union is only used for actual payments, whilst bitcoin transactions are largely made up of people buying and selling bitcoin and moving bitcoin between different addresses which they might even own themselves, meaning that interpreting the figures to indicate that bitcoin is being used for more international remittances than Western Union would be misleading at best.  Western Union recently stated that bitcoin was not ready for the mainstream, however, moves have been afoot to release updates to the protocol that will encourage retailers into the space, allowing for receipts, refunds and human-readable bitcoin addresses to be introduced, a move by the Bitcoin core developers that may well have helped drive this recent round of speculation.  While some have suggested that the bitcoin price has the potential to reach the $2,000 mark within the next few years, estimates like these are increasingly being looked upon as extremely conservative, especially when compared to the recent reports like those by Raoul Paul at Global Macro Investor who's first ""fair value"" price target was a staggering $1m per coin.  Paul suggested one bitcoin should be worth 700oz of gold or pretty close to $1m. Adjusting existing supply of both gold and BTC to equal each other, he calculated that one bitcoin is currently worth 0.14oz of gold. He said:  ""That gives bitcoin an upside of 5,000 times to equal the current price of gold, supply adjusted.""  He said it is a common belief that gold may be much higher in value than it is now in five to 10 years, ""thus, versus the USD the upside for bitcoin could be multiples of that"".  ""Now, before you shake your head, simply go back to the chart of gold versus the USD and just recognise that it has risen 8750% since the 1920s. And just remember that Microsoft rose 61,000% from its IPO to it’s peak,"" Paul added.  The Winklevoss twins are equally bullish on bitcoin, recently stating that they thought the bitcoin market cap had the potential to reach $400bn and Peter Thiel, founder of Paypal, stating: “It is worth thinking about money as the bubble that never ends. There is this sort of potential that bitcoin could become this new phenomenon.""  Do you think the price will spike again tonight after tonight's Senate hearing?

42376692,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cOLx,1384872916,Sinister New Site 'Assassination Market' Enables Users to Contribute Bitcoins for Murder of US Officials,"On the same evening that bitcoin advocates Jerry Brito and Patrick Murck went to testify on Capitol Hill alongside Jennifer Shasky Calvery from FinCEN, a report published online by Forbes underlines the sinister challenges that lie before law enforcement when dealing with the threats posed by virtual currencies, and bitcoin in particular.  The report is about Assassination Market, a disturbing site that enables people to contribute bitcoins towards a bounty on the head of one of a number of government officials.  While assassination markets are not a new idea, and were initially proposed by crypto-anarchist and cypherpunk Jim Bell in his essays entitled ‘Assassination Politics’ in 1992, they have never had quite the public exposure that they got today in online media; exposure which could perhaps instil panic on Capitol Hill in the trail of the bitcoin hearings.  The founder of Assassination Market, an anonymous crypto-anarchist going by the name of Kuwabatake Sanjuro after the ronin Samurai in the film Yohimbo, launched the site just four months ago and, according to Forbes, six targets have already been submitted, and donations made for their assassinations.  The targets include NSA director Keith Alexander, President Barack Obama and Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, the current bounty for whom stands at approximately $80,000 in bitcoin.  Bernanke, who today offered muted interest in bitcoin in a letter to US Senators declaring ""bitcoin may hold long-term promise"" is famously included in the bitcoin source code, and has long been the target of some of the most extreme elements of libertarian ideology.  So his inclusion on the hit-list should come as no surprise, but it is sad bitcoin will now be associated with this kind of radical politics, while also being starkly indicative of the dissatisfaction felt widely about Bernanke's continuing policy to increase QE thereby devaluing the US dollar.  Equally, the hacker who created the site has grand ambitions, stating that he wishes to ""destroy all governments everywhere ... I believe it will change the world for the better”. He said:    “Thanks to this system, a world without wars, dragnet panopoticon-style surveillance, nuclear weapons, armies, repression, money manipulation, and limits to trade is firmly within our grasp for but a few bitcoins per person.      I also believe that as soon as a few politicians get offed and they realize they’ve lost the war on privacy, the killings can stop and we can transition to a phase of peace, privacy and laissez-faire.""    Needless to say, many people have observed huge flaws in Sanjuro's argument that assassination markets would make the world a better place.  Sanjuro notes that he will only accept targets “who have initiated force against other humans. More specifically, only people who are outside the reach of the law because it has been subverted and corrupted, and whose victims have no other way to take revenge than to do so anonymously”.  On the face of it, it’s unclear as to whether a market for assassinations like this can work in practice, as the method of claiming responsibility is a little obscure, with would-be assassins submitting ‘bets’ on when a hit might take place, and then claiming the bounty once the target has been eliminated.  Although it may prove to be a viable system, in light of Silk Road’s alleged founder Ross Ulbricht’s arrest, a black market for assassination may simply be the next on the FBI’s hitlist.  Bell, who served time in prison for tax evasion and harassing a federal agent, has apparently declined to comment publicly, but has denied any involvement with Sanjuro.

42376708,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cOcJ,1384867835,Balanced Regulation Could Help the Good in Bitcoin Overcome the Bad,"“Mitigate the risks, while minimizing the burden.”  That was a memorable line about the responsibilities of any financial provider from Jennifer Shasky Calvery, the Director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), part of the United States Department of the Treasury.  She uttered this phrase during a US Senate Committee hearing yesterday (18th November), titled 'Beyond Silk Road: potential risks, threats, and promises of virtual currencies', which brought together government representatives, leaders from within the bitcoin economy and advocates for virtual currency enforcement.  For bitcoin and other decentralized virtual money enthusiasts, the session made for intriguing television on the Cable-Satellite Public Affairs Network (C-Span).  This hearing made clear what the major problems are to those who have to deal with the emerging concept that is digital currency. Let’s examine what was said.  Crime  On a positive note, law enforcement made clear that bitcoin and its brethren should not be considered unlawful.  “Virtual currencies in and of themselves are not illegal,” said Mythili Raman, acting assistant attorney general of the Criminal Division of the US Department of Justice, in her concluding remarks.  However, the fact that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are being used as a means to conduct criminality brings it into the spectre of the authorities.  There is major concern about virtual currencies being used on black marketplaces similar to the now-defunct Silk Road. These online resources for obtaining illegal goods and services are now pretty common and there are a number of sites that specialize in digital crimes. An example cited in the hearing was a network on which users can buy and sell financial information from Eastern Europe.  These sites (there's actually more than one) supply stolen credit cards and other banking information to identity thieves, according to Edward Lowery, of the Secret Service, who also provided testimony.  It’s fair to say these marketplaces do not rely on virtual currencies alone, but also the use of anonymizers and other tools of online illegal trade.  Privacy vs anonymity  Another issue raised in the hearing was that people can, and will, leverage the anonymity afforded by bitcoin to hide what they are doing in the digital realm. Everyone should have the right to some degree of privacy, and most would agree with that assessment, but that privacy should not extend to masking egregious illegality, such as the production, trade and transfer of child pornography.  Ernie Allen, the president and CEO of the International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children, spoke at the hearing, pleading that particular case. Given the subject matter, his argument was very convincing.  “While much of the evidence is still anecdotal, there is consensus that commercial child pornography, sexual exploitation, sex trafficking and other criminal enterprises are increasingly moving to a new unregulated, unbanked digital economy,” he said in his statement.  Banks  The ""unbanked"" also had an advocate at this hearing. Speaking as a representative for bitcoin as a tool to help the unbanked was Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle Internet Financial, Inc.  “In many cases, our financial systems have excluded enormous bases of consumers who remain unbanked or under-banked,” he said.  It’s clear Allaire believes that, compared to the digital revolution that has sprouted up around bitcoin, banking remains woefully behind and many customers of huge financial institutions would likely agree.  “Specifically, our payments systems are cumbersome and inefficient, and very much built upon systems and processes that are decades old. The result is that consumers and businesses all around the world are paying an implicit tax in the form of higher costs, lower margins and less efficient economic interaction,” said Allaire.  Afterword  Illegal activities, nefarious behavior and antiquated financial systems have all contributed to bitcoin adoption, and, thus, generated interest from the US government. However, there are also many good things that are coming from the rise of distributed digital currency.  Consider the effort to raise money for recent typhoon victims, which has filled the coffer of a digital wallet with goodwill. Or the newfound financial resources early adopters have experienced because of their very early intuitions about bitcoin's promise. Also, merchants all over the world are conducting business with lower overheads by accepting bitcoin as a form of electronic payment.  Yet at the same time, illegal black marketplaces with bitcoin being used as a payment method continue to flourish. Anonymity and virtual currency continues to allow people to do things they would not want their neighbors to know about.  Whether for this reason, or another, the banking industry condemns any sort of virtual currency customer while financial titans like Bank of America publish blog posts anointing its benefits in an effort to pander.  It’s crucial to allow for new means of payments and remittance so, as a result, it’s absolutely essential for there to be a continuing dialog about decentralized virtual currencies.  There has to be a balance that develops so the good can, in the end, overcome a lot of the bad that people associate with the concept of virtualized money.  This is all part of a process, and maturation, of the enlightening theory that built bitcoin to the point that it is at now from wherever and whomever it came from.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/19/balanced-regulation-could-help-the-good-in-bitcoin-overcome-the-bad,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4c148ffe99b58cdc0e06c0051b582f7c1dba60aa-1024x768.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376697,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cOSF,1384858213,"Yet Another Subway Shop Now Accepts Bitcoin, This Time in Slovakia","Subway is quickly becoming the bitcoin fast-food franchise, albeit unwittingly and unofficially.  A third Subway sandwich shop, following the lead of shops in Moscow and Allentown, Pennslyvania, is now accepting payments from customers bearing bitcoin.  The latest outlet, this time in Bratislava, Slovakia, has accepted bitcoins since 13th November, when the first payment was made to the wallet associated with the shop. Since then, a modest five payments have been made.  With now three Subway shops across the world accepting bitcoin, questions are beginning to be asked about whether it is merely coincidence, or something else.  Subway has over 40,000 stores around the world, so three seemingly unconnected stores in the US, Russia and Slovakia are a drop in the ocean of the wider Subway business.  At the same time, there have been no reports of McDonald's or KFC accepting bitcoins. Subway the brand is beginning to become associated with bitcoin ­­– at least for reddit’s bitcoin audience.    On 3rd November, a tweet revealed the first Subway shop accepting bitcoin in Moscow:      Subway near Moscow offers 10% off if you pay with #Bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/QMX4bJsNAP      — Alberto GomezToribio (@gotoalberto) November 3, 2013          However, an earlier picture posted on Instagram indicated that the shop had been accepting bitcoin since the summer:    Days later, on 8th November, it emerged that a Subway in the United States was also accepting bitcoin. Though there was initial scepticism, a follow-up video confirmed that the outlet accepted bitcoin; on the flip side, the video also confirmed that payments with bitcoin can be tricky and slow if both parties aren’t entirely clued up.  News of the shop in Bratislava first emerged on reddit in a post by user jangwao, who said that the owner of the franchise, Martin Petrus (according to this local report), had previously used bitcoins on an online business.  It isn’t clear as to whether the three shops independently decided to accept bitcoin payments, or if the Moscow outlet inspired the franchise owners in Allentown and now Bratislava.  However, the first payments to the wallet addresses associated with the Allentown and Bratislava outlets are both later than the reports of the Moscow outlet, so it is possible that this is a case of bitcoin-savvy business owners being persuaded by the example set by others.  According to posts on a local Slovakian forum, the Subway franchise is using MyCelium to process bitcoin payments [Google Translate], just like the shop in Moscow. Update 19/11/2013 17:08 – the store actually uses btcpos.com.  A spokesperson for Subway wouldn’t be drawn on whether the brand approved or disapproved of their franchisees using bitcoin and noted that all Subway stores are “independently owned and operated”.  However, they added: “As part of their franchise agreement, franchisees are required to comply with all local laws.”  Update 19/11/2013 15:13 – Bratislavia Subway owner Martin Petrus, also the founder of a Slovakian bitcoin exchange that launched in August of this year, has been in touch via email and says he only found out about the Allentown and Moscow subways after he started accepting bitcoin in his shop.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE,Kadhim Shubber,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/19/yet-another-subway-shop-now-accepts-bitcoin-this-time-in-slovakia,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0f41b9cc08f7e97d9228538b47550d75e8abf61d-800x600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376699,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cOQz,1384822975,Senate Bitcoin Hearing Discusses Legitimacy and Challenges of Virtual Currencies,"View the full video of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing on virtual currencies here.  Don't bother running from regulation, said an influential agency director at a key government hearing on Monday 18th November – because in the long term, there's nowhere to hide.  FinCEN director Jennifer Shasky Calvery warned virtual currency companies against fleeing US shores in the hope of more lenient regulatory frameworks elsewhere.  ""If business is going to leave the United States based on perceived or actual regulatory burden, I always believe that they're going to find that gain short-lived,” she said.  Calvery was responding to a question from Senator Tom Carper, chair of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee Hearing on Virtual Currency. He asked her about the danger of US companies leaving the US, and taking jobs and revenue with them, because of strict regulatory guidelines in the US.  [post-quote]  “Every country has an interest in protecting its financial system from illicit actors who launder money or move it on behalf of terrorist organisations, in collecting taxes and protecting investors and protecting consumers from fraud, and ensuring a stable economy,” said Calvery.  “If this virtual payment system is going to survive and be a real player in the financial system, regulation, both at home and abroad, is going to catch up, because it has to.”  The US participates in a Financial Action Task Force, which is an inter-governmental body designed to harmonise policies on anti-money laundering legislation.  Calvery's sentiment drew criticism from Jerry Brito, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University and director of its Technology Policy Program, who also testified at the hearing.  ""The danger is not that somebody who is trying to facilitate an illicit businesses will leave the US,” he said. “The danger is that real hard-working entrepreneurs who are looking to comply just don't find a regulatory environment that is amenable here.”  Patrick Murck, general counsel for the Bitcoin Foundation, called for leadership in the banking industry to ensure that bitcoin companies were ‘on-boarded’, to avoid what he called a chilling effect on bitcoin in the US.  Those comments echo those of CoinDesk’s own contributing editor and head of the Bitcoin Foundation Jon Matonis, who penned an op-ed here over the weekend warning of weakening US influence in bitcoin trading.  At the federal level, government speakers suggested that current regulations were adequate. Across the board, the Department of Justice, FinCEN, and the Secret Service suggested that existing statutes were sufficient to regulate virtual currencies as they stood, and didn't suggest new legislation specifically for bitcoin or other decentralised digital cash.  Individual states were another issue. Jeremy Allaire, founder of Circle Internet Financial, highlighted challenges with how money transmission licences were granted in the US.  ""There are a broad number of states, and divergent approaches that each state might take, and I do think that creates cost and complexity, and could be argued to be an unnecessary regulatory burden. But that is the system that we have."" Allaire has already courted individual states in an attempt to negotiate operations there.  Allaire suggested that regulation was necessary in the virtual currency space, however, calling for a ""higher bar"" when dealing with financial services:  ""Two guys can build a photo sharing app and put it on the web and get one billion users. I don't think it's appropriate that two guys should be able to build a financial services business and operate that without sufficient investment to protect consumers and society."" He realized this when raising his $9m in capital, he added.  Others warned of the need to ""send a message"" to users of black-market sites such as Silk Road that they cannot trust those sites. ""There are many criminals migrating to hidden services on the Internet, and that has been a challenge for law enforcement,"" said Mythili Raman, acting assistant attorney general for the US Department of Justice’s Criminal Division.  ""It can be frustrating to the public to see another website pop up after one that seems similar to it just having been taken down, but it is incredibly important for us to be taking those steps,"" she continued.  FinCEN’s Calvery closed her own statements by calling the ownership of a banking license a privilege, providing great power.  ""While innovation is a wonderful thing, and innovation in the financial services industry is incredibly important, it does come with obligations to have that entry and be a part of the US financial system,” she added. “One of those obligations is to protect that system from illicit actors.""  Calvery called on virtual currency operators to do three things. Firstly, register with FinCEN, she said. Secondly, put solid AML practices in place.  ""And maintain records and provide certain reports to FinCEN, including suspicious activity reports,” she concluded, pointing to existing players in the conventional fiat world. “They have all found a way to offer their services while maintaining those same protections.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/19/senate-bitcoin-hearing-discusses-legitimacy-and-challenges-of-virtual-currencies,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/68f8cb7485b976ac822fb243d06d33bda33455b3-3840x2400.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
