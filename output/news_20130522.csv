42376500,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AkHT,1369254491,See a sneak preview of the Bitcoin documentary,"The following trailer offers a sneak preview of the coming documentary, ""The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin,"" which is still in production but was previewed at Bitcoin 2013. According to the Internet Movie Database (IMDB), the film is scheduled for release in October 2013:  Backed by Daronimax Media, Fair Acres Media and 44th Floor, ""The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin"" features actor/musician Ben Bledsoe as the film's narrator.  The documentary follows the journey of a married 35-year-old computer programmer with three young boys from Pittsburgh who become obsessed with Bitcoin. Along the way, the film also features some names familiar in the cryptocurrency world: Gavin Andresen, Charlie Shrem, Roger Ver, Mike Caldwell (Casascius) and Erik Voorhees, among others.  The Hollywood Reporter  reported last month that the filmmakers are ""using the controversial robo-money to complete production"" through crowdfunding.  ""The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin"" is produced and directed by Nicholas Mross.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC,Shirley Siluk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/22/see-a-sneak-preview-of-the-bitcoin-documentary,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/879efe4788d1787285b64cf565b0510ea220043d-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376492,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AkBB,1369234813,Bitcoin's biggest impact may not be financial,"For all the fuss about Bitcoin -- it is turning us all into tax-dodging, drug-taking criminals, etc., etc. -- its most important impact might have nothing to do with money at all.  The technology at the heart of Bitcoin is the world's biggest and most powerful supercomputer. It could be this that has a real impact on all our futures. A network that is already as powerful as 500 supercomputers has to be taken seriously.  Google, Facebook and the other internet giants spend billions of dollars on their networks of data centers. Companies switch computer processing from data centers around the world depending on off-peak electricity costs or the presence of colder temperatures to reduce cooling costs.  The industry depends on tiny improvements in power or heat performance to cut prices for hosting websites or more complex computing functions.  But the Bitcoin architecture of a perfectly distributed computer would allow its network to run almost any computing function.  This isn't the first such network ... anyone remember SETI@home?  SETI  , which stands for the ""search for extraterrestrial intelligence,"" describes a variety of scientific efforts that have taken place over past decades to find and identify signs of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe. The SETI@home computing project, hosted by the Space Sciences Laboratory at the University of California-Berkeley, launched in May 1999. It asked ordinary internet users to download a small piece of software to help researchers search for aliens. This software used your computer downtime to check radio telescope signals for unexpected radio waves. The network of millions of machines was used to replace an actual supercomputer.  Now with some three million client machines, the SETI@home network is still working and still looking for evidence of life on other planets. Various BitTorrent clients provide similar networked services.  The Bitcoin network is even more sophisticated and more secure than either of these.  Much has been made of how Bitcoin solves the problem of micro-payments. But what if it solved that problem in a totally different way?  What if, for example, the Bitcoin network could be used to let future websites ask their users to provide computing power if they wished to access the site or services for free?  ""This could be a way to monetize your website,"" computer security expert Mikko Hypponen told CoinDesk. ""People's computers could mine an alternative currency while they're looking at your site or using your service. This could be better than funding sites through advertising.""  But mining might just be the first iteration. You could use a network like Bitcoin's to carry out almost any computing function currently provided by a data center.  If your business can attract users -- and their computers -- it could use those machines to crunch numbers, send emails or handle any other processing required.  Of course, online criminal types have been doing this for years with botnets. But Bitcoin might be the technology that makes the botnet mainstream, even if the currency itself does not survive. Just imagine: harnessing the Bitcoin network could give even the smallest startup access to an amazing amount of computing power.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,CoinDesk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/22/bitcoins-biggest-impact-may-not-be-financial,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/86789ed4c65c1148e19ebd3c116189ccad3667ab-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376498,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AkJz,1369223036,Bitcoin isn't just for men,"What’s the deal with women and Bitcoin?  Anyone who’s spent more than 12 seconds browsing the discussions on the Bitcoin Forum, reddit’s Bitcoin subreddit or any other Bitcoin-related site could be forgiven for thinking the digital currency is inherently a guy thing.  There are Vinnies, Rons, Dans and Alexes galore, with avatars of dudes, battleships and fireballs. (Similarly, the ""real-world"" crowd at this past weekend's Bitcoin 2013 was also heavy on the testosterone.)  The XY- to XX-chromosome imbalance of the Bitcoin world is so baked in that newbies are actually warned to have their scam antennae on the lookout for “any user blatantly claiming to be female.”  Why is that? On the one hand, it seems to make sense in that Bitcoin is a creation of the coder/hacker/tech community, which skews extremely male. On the other hand, bitcoins are just money … and no one designates GDP as boy- or girl-only. (Although some enterprises in the “real-world” fiat economy seem to think in those terms by coming out with ludicrous offerings like pens for women.)  “I have not noticed any relevance of gender in the Bitcoin community,” says Sophia Alonzo, a New Orleans-based jewelry-maker who sells her creations on her Etsy store, NBetween. A member of Etsy’s Bitcoin Team (merchants who accept the digital currency), Alonzo chalks up the lopsided demographics of bitcoin to the fact that, “there are just fewer women in technical communities than men in general.”  The unfamiliar nature and relative newness of the digital currency alone explain a lot, says Rachel Parnell, another Bitcoin-accepting Etsy merchant who has also used the BitGigs bitcoin job board.  “I think that the idea of a currency that changes value so quickly is making other people hesitant to adopt its use because they're still comparing it to fiat,” she writes in an email. “Also, since it's so new, kinks in the system are likely to be found, and they sometimes take time to be ironed out. As with any new thing that is meant for public use, its success is determined by how many people are willing to use it. If fewer women were early adopters that probably means they either aren’t as willing to or don’t have the means to take a risk on such a new thing.”  Etsy crafter Maygin Theresa began accepting bitcoins as a way to broaden her market after hearing about the digital currency from her friend-roommate, who's been ""following Bitcoin since its inception."" She acknowledges the unfamiliarity of the idea does prompt skepticism.  ""My experience is rather limited, in general, as I've only just recently learned about bitcoin,"" she notes. ""But I will say that people seem to want to warn me against Bitcoin for reasons that don't seem to be based on much of anything other than the loosest grasp of the concept.""  From a businesswoman's perspective, Bitcoin makes sense to Jennifer Longson of the Cups and Cakes Bakery in San Francisco.  ""Adding the BitPay app to our iPad register was super easy, and the low fees and no chargebacks was a huge selling point,"" she says. While she acknowledges being ""certainly one of the few"" women in the Bitcoin community, she adds, ""I haven't had any negative reactions, for sure.""  Rather than simply bemoan the lack of ladies in the Bitcoin world, Pua Pyland -- aka “The Bitcoin Wife” – decided to confront the issue head-on. She kicked off her retro-looking blog-online store-review site in early May with a post titled, “Bits or GTFO”:    “Bitcoin Needs More Vagina.      And I’m not talking about GirlsGoneBitcoin. I am a wife and a mother. And I love to spend me some Bitcoin …    There must be other women out there like me. Right? Right?!?!…hellooo?    Ladies, this is a call to arms. I am on a mission to turn this sausage fest into the fabulous soiree that Bitcoin was born to be. Your boyfriend/husband/partner/brother/boss has been talking your ear off about decentralized currency … market volatility … or that Bitcoin town in Germany they want to visit … and seriously, what’s up with that french guy in Japan who loves the magic card game?    Cue the the eye rolls, and stroking of the air phallus, I get it.    It’s time to chickity check yo’ self. Spending Bitcoin is so easy. You can buy some dope things with it, and I’m not talking about SilkRoad. I’ve got lots of goodies in store for you from food to fashion to travel. These are exciting times, and the boys shouldn’t get to have all the fun.    Come along on this journey with me. I am The Bitcoin Wife.    Aloha, Misses P”    Pyland – who lives in Kailua, Hawaii, with her husband and four children, and works in clinical information systems – said she got into Bitcoin after her husband, Ta'a Pyland caught a “This Week in Tech” podcast on the digital currency in February 2011.  “He called me while I was work that day, beyond stoked about the mind-blowing potential of Bitcoin,” she recalls. “A decentralized peer-to-peer currency built on the strength of a worldwide network of computational power? Genius! We both knew right then and there we had to be a part of the movement.”  For a while afterward, Pyland said she “lurked on the forums and threads in hopes that a strong female presence would eventually grow organically as Bitcoin matured. I have yet to see that happen, so I'm glad The Bitcoin Wife has started a healthy dialogue.”  That’s one way of putting it. After announcing her site on reddit’s Bitcoin subreddit, Pyland found herself the focus of numerous comments, some positive, some not so much:  “(H)oly satoshi, what an entrance!"" she recalls. ""I knew my post was going to make some waves, but I didn't expect the site to receive 5,000 hits on its very first day.”  The occasional male poster questioned whether Pyland was in fact a woman, while “(m)any mistook the site as an intentional cheap shot to offend,” she says. Other female commenters happily noted they were also “Bitcoin wives,” and Pyland took all the responses in stride.  “The 1950s RedBook-esque feel to the site is an ode to the place I'm in at this point in my life, thanks to Bitcoin. Most of my adult life I have been a busy career woman/mother in the IT world. Bitcoin has afforded me the choice to kiss the rat race goodbye and take on a comfortable supporting role at home. I am embracing the hell out of that on my site, and having some fun with it.”  Pyland has so far seen less success with her subreddit group Bitcoin Ladies, which remained eerily quiet two weeks into its existence. The Bitcoin Wife site, though, has so far achieved what she wanted it to:  ""I've been able to get in touch with other women out there who use Bitcoin, who accept Bitcoin, who are married to Bitcoiners like me, and that is exactly what I was hoping for,"" she said.  Over time, she expects the Bitcoin community to look different than it does today.  ""Bitcoin's usability infrastructure is maturing fast and pushing us into a ... transformation stage in the game,"" Pyland says. ""This is naturally changing the demographic of the user base. I think awareness is key for women to become involved and articles like Kashmir Hill's 'Living on Bitcoin for a Week' is the kind of positive female journalism we need.""  Cups and Cakes' Longson also sees long-term change coming as the demographics of the science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) professions evolve.  ""It seems to be changing slowly but surely, but encouraging women to go into STEM fields seems the way to go,"" she says.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Shirley Siluk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/22/bitcoin-isnt-just-for-men,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/23949925911829a3238d9ae7272df52073b10654-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376485,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6Ak4t,1369208674,"BitVegas: Gambling, Minecraft, pigs and zombies","What happens when Bitcoin meets Minecraft? BitVegas, an online casino for lovers of digital currency who are also fanatical about the blocky, virtual-world-creating game populated by pigs, sheep, zombies, creepers and a guy named Steve.  Reddit user emperorofinsanity posted some preview photos of the site on Tuesday, noting that the newly revamped virtual casino now includes a slot machine as well as Minecraft-style games of blackjack, poker, roulette, MineField and pig racing (""Bacon Racing,"" as it's called).  Furthermore, he added, ""We added a lot of esthetic stuff like bars and gardens and chairs and whatnot, to make it feel more like an actual casino.""  Every player that joins the Minecraft casino server receives five ""play Bitcoins"" -- even more virtual versions of the virtual currency -- to begin gambling with. While these can't be exchanged for the Satoshi Nakamoto type of Bitcoin, players do have a chance every 15 minutes to be ""gifted"" 0.5 mBTC (mBTC is a millibitcoin -- ""Millie"" -- or 1/1000 of a bitcoin ... around 12 cents US as of May 22, 2013, so 0.5 mBTC is about 60 cents).  ""These coins are real and can be used to gamble for actual bitcoins,"" the Bitcoin Wiki's BitVegas entry reads. ""The server has options to withdraw/deposit bitcoins. Transactions go through almost instantly and no fees are taken from the player's winnings.""  The entry adds, ""All games are provably fair."" Check-marked boxes next to each game link players to information about both the current and previous game round to demonstrate fair play, according to the Wiki.

The company's online presence took shape only days before during ""a pretty amazing experience at the 2013 Bitcoin Conference,"" Johnston wrote on reddit.  ""Sunday morning I hacked together the first Bit Angels website, made a post on Reddit about a 12:00 noon meeting and a quick announcement at the conference about doing a first meeting of the Bit Angels. I invited 6 people and more than 20 showed up to the first meeting. Now more than 35 people have joined the group as of this posting. I've volunteered to be the Executive Director and things are moving fast. If you are an experienced entrepreneur and have a few BTC to invest come join us.""  In response to a question about the size of seed round funding Bit Angels expects, Johnston noted that ""200,000 mBTC (roughly $20,000 USD) level investments will have the most impact.""  He added, ""The idea is to be very Y-Combinator-ish. Meaning invest enough money to allow a hacker or two to focus 80 hours a week on a new startup they have been developing during weekend and evenings.""
