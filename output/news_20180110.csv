Described by some as a kind of ""Goldman Sachs for crypto,"" Bloomberg reports that the plan is to get the company listed on the TSX Venture Exchange and raise upwards of $200 million.

While Novogratz's group has a plan outlined for the future bank's operations, as well as a partial list of Galaxy Digital's management, the press release noted that the proposal was contingent on being accepted by the Canadian TSX Venture Exchange, all parties completing their due diligence inspecting company assets, and the formation of a board of directors independent of both Galaxy Digital and Bradmer.  The groups aim to finish their respective due diligence work before the end of the first quarter in 2018, according to statements.  Galaxy Digital was previously set to launch a cryptocurrency hedge fund before Novogratz moved to scuttle the launch in late December. At the time, he cited the challenges involved in managing clients' cryptocurrencies in addition to his own portfolio and other conflicts of interest.

The move - which comes amid reports that the Chinese government wants to slowly but surely quash the country's mining ecosystem – is said to be a notable one for the firm, according to statements. This, sources say, would be accomplished by curtailing access to supportive tax policies as well as the land and utilities needed to run a power-hungry bitcoin mine.  According to Handelszeitung, Bitmain is eyeing the Zug office as a way to grow its presence in Europe and, really, beyond its home base in China.  ""Bitmain Switzerland will play a key role in our global expansion,"" Bitmain told the paper.  The company further said that it plans to expand its footprint in Switzerland over the coming months, hiring new employees and making a concerted effort to work with the government, including the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).

42400841,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcL8am,1515613548,Goldman Sachs: Bitcoin Could Be Viable Money In Troubled Economies,"A new report published by Goldman Sachs highlights how bitcoin and cryptocurrencies could serve as alternative forms of money in troubled economies.  The report, released Wednesday and written by Goldman strategists Zach Pandl and Charles Himmelberg, highlights that the U.S. dollar’s usage by other nations means there is a demand for a store of value and medium of exchange that can be used across national borders, according to Bloomberg.  To that end, the dollar has done well – but it may not be the best currency in all cases.  As the two strategists explained:  “In those countries and corners of the financial system where the traditional services of money are inadequately supplied, bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies more generally) may offer viable alternatives.”  However, cryptocurrencies, as they exist now, would not necessarily be suitable for the purpose, according to the report, particularly in an environment roiled by speculation and volatile prices.  ""Our working assumption is that long-run cryptocurrency returns should be equal to (or slightly below) growth in global real output—a number in the low single digits,"" Pandla nd Himmelberg wrote.  National cryptocurrencies should be thought of as assets similar to gold or other metals to be viable, they added.  And while no country has actually launched its own cryptocurrency yet, some governments have made steps towards doing so.  Notably, Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro announced last month that the country would create its own token to help its economy. Yet officials in the country, including the opposition-led national legislature, have strongly pushed back against the idea.

42400837,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcL8Xp,1515602717,Kodak Debuts Bitcoin Miner as Blockchain Pivot Juices Stock Price,"Kodak has licensed its name to a new bitcoin mining product, an announcement that came after the U.S. firm made waves by revealing that it is lending its name to a new photo-centric cryptocurrency.  The Kodak KashMiner, as Business Insider reports, was on display at the CES tech trade show in Las Vegas yesterday. The company's name is being licensed out to California-based Spotlite Energy Systems, according to flyers circulating at the event, with the idea being that customers will rent the miners – but half of the proceeds will go back to Spotlite, however.  Specifically, Kodak and Spotlite are asking for an up-front payment of $3,400. Once in operation, the miners will produce $375 worth of bitcoin per month, boasting a two-year income of $9,000.  Yet as might be expected, Kodak's move – along with its plans to create a cryptocurrency that would form part of a digital rights management platform based on blockchain – has sparked an array of criticism, including those who have accused Kodak of looking for a short-term stock boost years after it exited bankruptcy.  If that was the intent, the strategy certainly worked. As of press time, according to data from Google, Kodak's stock price is over $10 after starting the week just above $3.  Curiously, the product bears a resemblance to the S9 mining product from China-based hardware maker Bitmain, with some commentators highlighting the physical similarities on social media.  Those behind the effort say customers are lining up to pay for the miners. A representative for Spotlite told the BBC that the company is already seeing demand for the miners and that it would move to add additional capacity.  ""At this time we have 80 miners, and we expect another 300 to arrive shortly. There is a big pile-up of demand,"" the rep explained.

42400851,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcL8kc,1515597918,Down Not Out? Ripple Bulls May Regain Momentum,"The 50 percent decline of Ripple's XRP token from the record highs may have strengthened the bears, but chart analysis indicates further downside may be limited.  As per data source OnChainFX, the world's third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has depreciated by 16.85 percent in the last 24 hours. As of writing, XRP is trading at $1.88 levels.  Part of the price drop from $3.36 to $2.07 witnessed on Monday can attributed to data provider CoinMarketCap's unannounced decision to exclude three Korean exchanges, causing its global average to suddenly drop. The resulting selloff came to halt after the change in average calculation methodology became public, allowing for a partial recovery in the XRP price to $2.46.  However, the relief was short-lived. XRP fell below $2.00 yesterday and hit a 12-day low of $1.71 today.  The decline in prices over the last 48 hours highlights the bearish undertone across the wider crypto markets.  Stellar lumens  has dropped by 15 percent over a 24 hour period; NEM and cardano are down 13 percent and 15 percent, respectively; while TRON has lost a hefty 24 percent in value.  Fighting the trend, the top performer is ether (ETH), which hit a new all-time high of $1,417 today. ETH has gained around 11 percent over 24 hours.  Ripple Chart  The chart (prices as per Bitstamp) above shows:  The bears are in control, courtesy of a bearish doji reversal (Jan. 4 doji candle and the negative price action on the following day), and a sharp drop to a 12-day low of $1.61 today.  The bearish 5-day and 10-day moving average (MA) crossover (short-term average cut long-term average from above) also indicate upticks are likely to be short-lived.  The rising trend line may offer support around $1.50.  The relative strength index (RSI) is pointing lower, but still holding above 50.00 (bullish territory).  View  XRP looks set to test the rising trend line support of $1.50. Dips below the same could be short-lived, given the RSI on 4-hour time frame and 1-hour time frame shows oversold conditions.  Bullish Scenario: A rebound from the trendline support, followed by a close above $2.15 (Jan. 5 low) would add credence to the oversold conditions as shown by the 4-hour and 1-hour RSI and signal further gain towards $3.00–$3.30 levels.  Bearish Scenario: A sustained move below $1.4154 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement) could yield a sell-off to sub-$0.50 levels.

The firm added support for bitcoin cash on Dec. 20, but soon after moved to disable trading of its newest asset – an offshoot of bitcoin with key technical differences. Hours later, trading against USD was reinstated.  GDAX general manager Adam White said in a blog post explaining the issues, that around 90 percent of initial requests were from people looking to buy bitcoin cash.  White wrote:  ""We paused trading on the BCH-USD book due to significant volatility caused by heavy market buy demand that resulted in insufficient liquidity.""  The low liquidity also caused the price of the cryptocurrency to shoot as high as $9,500, far higher than listed on other exchanges, he added.  According to the post, in the 2 minutes and 40 seconds after BCH/USD trading commenced, over 4,000 orders were placed, 3,461 matches occurred and trading volume reached $15.5 million.  Continued liquidity problems meant the relaunch of BCH/EUR and BCH/BTC books to be postponed until after the winter holidays, ""when there would be a higher likelihood of meeting liquidity standards needed to enable trading.""  Despite the firm's ""best efforts to create a fair and orderly market,"" the launch did not go as expected, White acknowledged.  Addressing allegations of possible insider trading around the BCH launch, the post also stated:  ""On November 13th, 2017, employees were notified of the decision to support BCH trading and were explicitly prohibited from buying and selling BCH.

42400848,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcL8hf,1515589217,"Goodbye ICOs, Hello TAOs? How Tokens Will Change in 2018","Christopher Pallotta and Vincent Molinari are the co-founders of Templum, an alternative trading system designed for cryptographic assets.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      As we enter 2018, it appears that blockchain's contribution to capital formation has only begun.  An unfortunate influx of both naive and bad actors begs for regulatory scrutiny, obscuring the intentions of ethical market participants anxious to operate within an informed set of dynamic guidelines and eventual laws.  In this environment, many anticipate increased regulatory action and enforcement by the SEC against issuers in 2018, and we will. But I don't expect the actions to stop there.  We will also likely see enforcement actions against certain ""exchanges,"" which transacted in coins that are definitely securities. We will likely see FINRA jumping in with the SEC bringing actions against individuals who acted as placement agents and finders in taking compensation for ICO sales. Unlicensed investment banks or unauthorized entities will be regulatory targets, having conducted securities business for their ICO activities.  Of major importance for everyone involved during this time will be the need for quality education, alleviating confusion surrounding how blockchain's facilitation of financial transactions differs from cryptocurrencies.  As a capital formation tool, blockchain is likely to increase the reach of both small- and large-scale fundings, adding a tangible new layer of transparency for issuers and regulators alike, while confirming KYC (know your customer) suitability compliance and providing investor protection, straight through processing.  We will see increased collaboration between the blockchain or crypto community and currently regulated entities, as a movement toward asset quality and rigorous due diligence begins to dominate the marketplace.  The result will be increased activity and investment by institutional investors and venture capitalists.  The name change  As for what that transition will look like in practice, those who are familiar with current practices in the token economy should expect cosmetic changes.  The entry of new market participants will greatly expand pools of capital, but the vast majority of ICOs will embrace issuance as securities, given the clear guidance from the SEC. In response, there will be very few ""true"" utility token issuances in 2018. The SAFT framework will rapidly decline as an issuing structure.  In response, I expect that a new second-generation acronym (such as tokenized asset offering or ""TAO"") will replace ICO. Increasing bad press, regulatory enforcement and class action lawsuits (concerning coins issued before the infamous DAO) may dominate headlines, and ultimately, tarnish the monicker.  But this new model won't just be the same idea with a new coat of paint. Expect the SEC, CFTC and FINRA to collaborate on industry guidelines that merge the priorities of each, very similarly to how the SEC and NASSA cooperated for Reg A+ during the JOBS Act.  A regulatory oversight consortium would propose multi-agency rules for tokens, addressing their dual role in capital raising and eventual transactions as a secondary instrument.  This could create a pathway for perhaps an integrated hybrid token, one which is not only a security but also maintains a derivative utility function and or an alternate currency status, which may settle the utility vs. security vs. commodity debate.  Size and scope squared  That's not to say some things won't be lost.  The early days of ICOs will be credited with introducing and accelerating the use of smart contracts for aggregating capital. Heralded as the catalyst for major Wall Street disruption, tokenized securities will lead to a second generation of market participants, scaling global capital formation upward.  2018 will see the acceptance and rapid growth of TAO-style instruments, as the next wave dwarfs 2017's ICO issuance. An amnesty program for pre-DAO participants is also in order, for those inclined to view their tokens as securities, deserving of a regulatory framework.  The market will update functionality and build out new infrastructure for the sector. Securities trade clearance, settlement, transfer, depository and custody methods will evolve alongside modernized securities laws, lending greater transparency to regulators and comfort to participants. Standardized and immutable smart contract audit trails and archiving invite large institutions and venture capitalists to use this new tool to drive changes in the democratized access to capital, secondary liquidity and wealth creation that blockchain brings.  Traditional large financial service institutions will enter the space by acquiring early-stage market participants, while others build theirs out organically or by poaching teams. Bulge bracket firms will eventually wake up to market share erosion and realize that tradable TAO assets could become a significant trading desk product, which features monetizable profit margin, volumes and volatility.  The future of smart contracts as an essential tool in finance is solidified and irreversible.  Women win  But, we don't think it will just be money flows that benefit. The acceptance of blockchain and arrival of smart contracts is likely to have far-reaching benefits.  Social media will democratize tokenized securities promotion by expanding the issuer's reach beyond established funding channels. Updated capital formation, compounded by stronger investor education, can level the commercial playing field for women, affinity groups, fan bases and diaspora communities that also benefit from impact investing's many constructive side effects.  Channeling capital toward the underutilized global female brain trust could empower a mass of resource-deprived entrepreneurs, business leaders and innovators. This intersection of democratized capital, tech advances and social media may even begin a tectonic paradigm shift that accelerates gender equality.  In this way, we expect blockchain crowdfunding to ensure greater financial independence for women, a result which will confirm that United Nations Sustainable Development Goal number five (gender equality).  Thanks to blockchain, 2018 will be a year of change and volatility, but we hope, inclusion as well.

42400842,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcL8bl,1515589202,Overstock Payments Glitch Mixes Up Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash: Report,"Online retail giant Overstock.com has reportedly experienced a cryptocurrency payments bug that could have allowed customers to mint money simply via repeated cancellation of orders.  Last week, North Carolina-based bank security firm Bancsec informed journalist Brian Krebs that Overstock.com had erroneously accepted bitcoin cash instead of bitcoin as payment for a product.  To confirm the issue, Krebs ordered a $78 motion sensor light on Overstock and opted to make payment by bitcoin.  ""Logging into Coinbase, I took the bitcoin address and pasted that into the 'pay to:' field, and then told Coinbase to send 0.00475574 in bitcoin cash instead of bitcoin,"" Krebs writes on his website. Because of the glitch, the security specialist was able to make a $78 purchase by sending approximately $12-worth of bitcoin cash.  As experienced by Bancsec, Overstock's website approved the transaction. What was potentially more damaging to the firm is the fact that, upon cancellation of the order, Overstock processed the refund in bitcoin.  Currently, a single bitcoin is priced at around $14,000, while its offshoot bitcoin cash is trading at $2,400. So, a malicious customer could have easily made large amounts of money simply by making repeated cancellations of orders of high-priced items at Overstock.  Krebs writes: ""Reached for comment, Overstock.com said the company changed no code in its site and that a fix implemented by [payments partner] Coinbase resolved the issue.""  Coinbase reportedly said that the issue was caused by ""the merchant partner improperly using the return values in our merchant integration API,"" and noted that no other Coinbase customer had reported the problem. The error had existed for about three weeks, it added.  Krebs said he and Bancsec had looked for the same glitch at other merchants that ""work directly with Coinbase in their checkout process,"" but they found ""no other examples of this flaw.""

Coindesk's Bitcoin Price Index has dropped 18 percent in the last three days and extended losses to $13,455 levels today – the lowest level since Jan. 1. As of writing, bitcoin is at $13,830 levels.  Data source OnChainFX indicates the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has depreciated by 7.18 percent in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) is also down 30 percent from the record high of $20,000 set in December.  As per popular definition, BTC is in a bear phase (more than 20 percent drop from the peak).  Further, the price charts suggests that bitcoin could extend its decline amid bearish indicators.  Bitcoin chart  The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows:  Bitcoin is extending its three-day losses with prices trading below the upward sloping 50-day moving average (MA) around $14,148.  Bearish continuation pattern: Yesterday's close at $14,480 confirmed a downside break of the rising wedge (acting as a continuation pattern here)/bear flag pattern. This indicates the bears are in control and could push prices lower to $7,926 (target as per the measured height method – i.e. the difference between wedge high/low subtracted from breakdown point of $14,700).  The target level derived with the help of the measured height method almost coincides with the support offered by the trendline sloping upwards from Sep. 15 low and Nov. 12 low. On the way down, BTC may find support at $12,500 (Dec. 30 low) and $10,400 (Dec. 22 low).  The only factor in favor of the bulls is the upward sloping 50-day MA.  View  BTC looks set to test support at $10,400 in the next couple of days and possibly extend the decline to $8,000–$7,926 levels over the next couple of weeks.  Bullish scenario: Only a close (as per UTC) today above $14,525 (intraday high) would add credence to the upward sloping 50-day MA and abort the bearish view. A close above $14,525 today and a bullish follow-through tomorrow would improve the odds of a return to $17,174 levels (Jan. 6 high).

Bitcoin, initially launched as a technical curiosity with no ascribed value beyond its merits as a digital currency, designed to solve the Byzantine Generals' Problem. The ease of transfer inherent in the cryptocurrency made it a popular currency of choice for crowdfunding the ethereum platform in 2014. Since its launch, the platform as become a popular tool for crowdfunding or building our other crowdfunded projects like Augur, Gnosis or Aragon.  In 2015, the Augur crowdsale was the first cryptocurrency project to collect funds in exchange for a promise to build a platform on top of ethereum. The model was still young. But with a white paper and a website to collect funds, the project was able to raise $5 million. Since then, the model has been replicated in a process called an ICO (initial currency offering), an acronym and process somewhat similar to a stock’s IPO (initial public offering).  Projects like Golem, Gnosis and Aragon have all raised funds with the promise of creating a peer-to-peer platform built on top of ethereum. As the price of ethereum skyrocketed from $8 to $40, then settled in the hundreds within a span of six months, the wealth created seemingly overnight gave way to the summer of ICOs in 2017.  Heading into late spring 2017, startup entrepreneurs with long-standing reputations started to adopt the ICO model. First, it was Bart Stephens of Blockchain Capital. Then, Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript with the Basic Attention Token and Brave. As the amounts raised by ICOs increased, we saw reputable law firms begin to enter the space, such as DLA Piper, Cooley and Perkins Coie.  The entry of well-established law firms brought a more formalized approach to the space and gave birth to the concept of the ""utility token"" and the security token, a reference to with the token issued in an ICO was a ""security"" that needs to be registered or exempt from registration with the SEC.  The following pertains to US laws and regulations and is not legal advice.  Why differentiate between utility tokens and security tokens?  A utility token is one that is interpreted to pass what’s known as the Howey Test, the precedent set by SEC v. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293 (1946).  The Howey Test interprets the sale of a token to be an investment contract if:  It is an investment of money  There is an expectation of profits from the investment  The investment of money is in a common enterprise  Any profit comes from the efforts of a promoter or third party.  A security token is a token which must either be:  Registered with the SEC and be subject to ongoing financial and material event reporting requirements  Fall under an exemption from registration that is traditionally used by private companies such as Rule 506 of Regulation D, Rule 506(c) of Regulation D, Regulation S or Regulation A+.  Technology that exists at the intersection of supply and demand gives birth to regulatory innovation.  In the case of ICOs, the relevant parties generating the supply and demand are blockchain startups, crypto investment funds and the related law firms. The demand generated by the crypto investment funds and those with significant liquidity in cryptocurrency created the greatest source of deployable startup capital we have ever seen. This demand generated an unprecedented amount of attention and supply from entrepreneurs crowdfunding for pre-functionality projects.  While nothing is atypical about this, it led to a large amount of entrepreneurs taking advantage of the opportunity to raise capital with little disclosure or diligence.  There’s a nice SEC ruling that impedes investment groups from simply purchasing tokens. If the token is construed as a security, then the investment fund will need to hold the tokens with a qualified custodian, and this led to the need to define a token as a utility token or protocol token. From the fundraisers’ perspective they can be subject to increased disclosures the costly legal fees associated with performing a Regulation D SAFT offering or similar.  Theoretically, if the token is a utility or protocol token, then there is no need for a qualified custodian to hold the tokens. This concept led to a plethora of entities branding themselves as protocol funds or operations such as Protocol Capital Fund I, Protocol Ventures, and Protocol Labs. Of the less explicitly named funds, we have Polychain Capital, Pantera Capital, and Metastable.  The protocol token effect  As budding ICO token sale founders began making their rounds in Silicon Valley in 2017, many were drilled with the line: ""Sorry, we only invest in protocol tokens.""  So it began. The mad dash to interpret a token as a protocol token. This briefly mythical token stood between hundreds of millions in funding and layers of red tape, hallmarked by the requirements for a token sale to impose accredited investor checks, minimum purchase limits (of at least $50,000), and a general unwillingness of the traditional investment funds to put in the cash.  The reality behind protocol tokens, is that they require highly technical teams that understand the low level mechanisms that make popular blockchains like bitcoin and ethereum work. Sadly, the human capital capable of creating a utility token is very limited due to years of general dismissal of bitcoin as a taboo.  Developers capable and engaged in the space sought their own blockchain startups or have already successfully launched their own token sales. But while the human capital that can undergo a token sale is limited, the demand has only increased.  There are currently a handful of public companies, private equity firms, and hedge funds that are seeking to enter the blockchain space by means of doing their own token sale. After speaking with investors, many are left with the mistaken impression that they must launch a utility token. Given the genetic makeup of their business, it is by no means possible nor practical. What emerged as a regulatory survival instinct of the crypto hedge funds has manifested into a mental roadblock for mainstream companies.  So what's the solution?  With the high number of new entrants to the space, registration and best practices can assist in thinking about the risks and rewards involved in undergoing an ICO.  Where do we go from here?  As we enter 2018 with a number of established businesses planning token sales, we are seeing several trends at TokenSoft. When established businesses are launching token sales, a majority are taking one of the following routes:  Rewards tokens : Tokens embedded into the platform to encourage user behaviors found to be beneficial to the platform (e.g. Kik's Kin token).  Equity-linked tokens: Tokens that allocate a portion of their cap table to the token sale (e.g. Finova Financial).  Dividend tokens : Tokens that entitle the holder to a percentage of profits (e.g. Finova Financial).  Distribution tokens : Tokens that entitle the holder to a percentage of liquidated assets at the end of the fund's lifecycle or upon a pre-determined liquidation event (e.g. the Apex Token Fund).  Let's take a look at each model.  Rewards Tokens  Rewards tokens can be integrated into an existing application to encourage users to interact with other users and/or the application in ways they would otherwise have no incentive to undergo.  Basic applications can be similar to Yelp and interactions can manifest into performing an act for a bounty or writing a review for a reward. The benefits of the rewards token are simple integration to existing infrastructure, the potential for interpretation as a utility token, and the potential for a technologically conservative roll out of the tokens.  This is a very practical option for established businesses as many have an in-depth understanding of customer acquisition costs and the types of interactions that they would like to reward. From an integration stand point, there is the opportunity to leverage well-tested wallet architectures such as pooled wallets and individual, client-side wallets as the needs of the platform scale.  Equity Linked Tokens  We saw the launch of the first equity linked token with the launch of the Finova Financial token sale (or Jobs Crypto Offering). The company is seeking to allocate a portion of their cap table to the token sale.  The tokens represent a fixed number of shares in the company, and the transfer of the token results in a transfer of equity (i.e. rights to future profits and liquidation rights). The benefits of the equity-linked token are that the ERC-20 standard allows not only traditional secondary market exchanges to accept the token but also traditional crypto exchanges to easily accept and integrate the token.  We have yet to see this play out with exchange listings; however, chances are that greater accessibility will lead to greater interest in an asset backed token. There remain several challenges with the model as it is still uncharted territory.  There are several complications embedded in this model that the token contract should include. For example, equity sales generally include transfer agents and KYC/AML requirements. Solving for these problems in smart contracts is simply the beginning of the blockchain world entering the world of traditional finance.  While these requirements can be accounted for at token issuance, private secondary market trades and public exchanges need to adapt to integrate these tokens as the companies continue to mature and permeate into traditional capital markets.  Dividend Tokens  One very common model, intuitive to those that emerge from the traditional world of finance are dividend paying tokens.  After users purchase a particular token, they are eligible to receive an air-drop in the form of ethereum as a percentage of quarterly profits due to investors. The company may use its quarterly profits and pay a percentage of these profits back to the token holders. Once the payment per token has been determined, the payout is rather trivial as the token tables for all token holders is publicly available.  Many of the dividend token challenges are the same as equity tokens with the added complexity of KYC/AML requirements on investors receiving the dividend for tax reporting in a 1099-div and tax of the profits prior to receiving the dividend. KYC/AML is in particular an issue with Cayman based funds that are seeking to issue dividend paying tokens to US investors and investors in other taxable jurisdictions.  Again, the token world needs to adapt to meet these regulatory requirements.  Distribution Tokens  An emerging model that works best with actively managed funds, distribution tokens provide the token issuer with the flexibility to invest over a longer term, while providing a guaranteed payout to token holders at a particular date.  A dividend token may provide a periodic payout to token holders in the form of ethereum or other currency. The difference between distribution and dividend tokens lies in the source of funds as well as the payment schedules. Regulatory requirements for both styles of tokens are similar,  The token issuer may raise funds through a standard ICO with the promise to take these funds and to invest them based on the fund mandate. The fund may have a strategy that allows them to take the funds and invest them in other cryptocurrencies, or one that makes investments in other funds.  The latter is known as a fund of funds and is currently being pioneered by Apex Token Fund. The fund will have a liquidation and distribution date, at which point the investments will be liquidated and proportionally distributed to token holders.  The intrigue of the model is in the speculation that will occur between the issuance, the performance reporting during the fund’s lifecycle and ultimately the distribution date. The performance of investments will be closely monitored and reflected in the price of the token in near-real-time. Whether the value of what is distributed will be equivalent to the token price will depend on fund performance and free-market value discovery.  Tokens grow up  As we exit the experimental stage or token sales, we enter a world where tokens will be adapted to existing regulatory frameworks of financial services.  While 2017 was full of demand generated by innovative blockchain developers with a move fast and break things mentality, 2018 will be marked by demand from the world of finance with a taste for compliance.  This infrastructure will be driven by regulatory requirements that financial institutions meet today, such as the Custody Rule, Alternative Trading Systems, Broker Dealers and Transfer Agents; and will reinvigorate the world of traditional finance.

42400840,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcL8Yo,1515560445,Quebec Lures Cryptocurrency Miners as China Sours on Industry,"Quebec was fishing for tech giants but caught bitcoin miners.  At least that’s how David Vincent, business development director at electric utility Hydro Quebec, describes the results of a campaign launched in 2016 to lure the likes of Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft to build their data centers in the Canadian province.  The sales pitch was simple: the province offers plentiful, cheap and renewable electricity, along with cold weather and a politically stable environment.  And while Hydro Quebec has gotten plenty of bites from traditional data center operators, the company also quickly discovered those same traits are equally attractive for cryptocurrency mining operations.  Nonexistent just six months ago, interest in Quebec from commercial-scale bitcoin miners has skyrocketed, Vincent said, amid the surge in cryptocurrency prices and political uncertainty in other jurisdictions.  For Hydro Quebec, 35 cryptocurrency mining organizations are asking the company for information regarding connecting to the power grid there. Those companies now account 70 percent of the total wattage capacity in Hydro Quebec's development pipeline.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Vincent said:  “I have so much demand right now there’s no need for marketing. Pretty much every day I have a new one.”  And sentiments from others suggest what Hydro Quebec is seeing now is just the tip of the iceberg.  ""Based on what I've seen in equipment purchase, real estate and power deals, things are exploding in Quebec,"" said Austin Hill, the former CEO of Blockstream, who is now investing in and backing some of the mining projects looking to Quebec.  Cheap and abundant  Cryptocurrency mining – the energy-intensive process by which new transactions are added to a blockchain – generally requires specialized hardware (either ASICs or GPUs) to solve complex mathematical puzzles. Because of the vast amount of computing power that's used, mining rigs generate a significant amount of heat, which is why mining operations look for colder environments to set up shop.  But it's not only the cold weather that's a draw for Quebec. The government's aggressive effort, during the post World War II era, to build dams in its northern regions has proven enticing enough to pull mining operators away from existing bases that already have weather on their side.  Because of that work, Quebec has become one of the largest hydroelectric power producers in the world. Hydro Electric, with 37,000 megawatts of installed electricity capacity, routinely produces at surplus levels and is thus able to offer some of the lowest rates in North America to its commercial customers.  For data centers, Hydro Quebec charges as low 2.48 cents (in USD) per kilowatt hour, and 3.94 cents per kilowatt-hour for bitcoin miners (the slight increase for the latter due to mining operations' smaller job creation and economic development footprint), Vincent said. These rates are anywhere from 50 percent to three times lower than in comparable parts of North America, according to data compiled by Hydro Quebec.  Historical consistency in pricing over time, and the assurance that the rates are not simply teasers that will jump overnight, are a key part of the value proposition for cryptocurrency mining operations, Vincent said. He added:  ""We always succeed at staying below inflation. It’s been like that since 1963 and it’s not going to change.""  And while some have argued that cryptocurrency mining is environmentally degrading, there's a growing trend by these mining operations toward finding competitive advantage via greater energy efficiency and resource optimization.  ""In some hotter environments, the current ASIC equipment ends up having a very short shelf life of around six to nine months because it gets so hot, and the cost of cooling it isn’t worth the cost of the equipment,"" Hill, who heads the Montreal-based Brudder Ventures, said, adding:  ""It’s just easier to run it super hot, throw it away and buy a new one. It’s hugely wasteful.""  And moving to cooler climates, like Quebec, could help.  Political stability  Another driver behind Quebec’s accidental emergence as a cryptocurrency mining hub is that miners are increasingly looking for stable political environments where they can deploy their capital investments and plan their business efforts four to five years in advance with a higher degree of confidence.  While several of Hydro Quebec's interested parties are based in North America, a significant number of mining organizations hail from countries, notably China, where the landscape for cryptocurrency mining, and cryptocurrencies in general, has become cloudier.  In China, for instance, rumors have been surfacing that the government plans on withdrawing preferential benefits such as cheap electricity and tax deductions to bitcoin mining operations. Plus, the People's Bank of China has been one of the more aggressive regulators in the world when it comes to cryptocurrency, most recently issuing a ban on initial coin offerings and moving to shut down bitcoin exchanges.  Notably, Vincent said mining interest in Quebec began to tick upward significantly last fall after these moves by China.  He told CoinDesk:  ""They don’t say it like that, but the fact that the rush of the demand came at pretty much the same time they were having problems in their previous jurisdiction, we could think there was a correlation.""  These concerns, along with a steady flow of reports about mining equipment seizures, kidnappings and game-playing by corrupt public officials in places like Venezuela, could make setting up shop in places where these risks are minimal more important than ever for mining operators.  A good problem  While Hydro Quebec is still, admittedly, trying to fully grasp this new class of customers, it’s been more than willing to roll out the welcome mat for them because of the enormity of the requests, not to mention the 24/7 nature of their operations.  To show mining operation's scale, Vincent compared them to Hydro Quebec's other customers.  Its smallest commercial customers, such as the Montreal Canadiens’ hockey arena, require five megawatts of electricity and a typical data center requires 30 to 60 megawatts. By contrast, ""the top-three to top-five miners in world, most of them are talking to us, and the demand that they have right now is around 200 to 300 megawatts,"" he said. ""It’s huge.""  But with an industry as volatile as cryptocurrency, nothing is fully set in stone, and as a risk-averse, publicly owned utility, Hydro Quebec is minimizing its exposure by requiring miners to foot the upfront cost of the power connection and arrange a line of credit from a third party large enough to offset any losses in the event of something dire.  ""The question for us is: is this a trend that will continue to stay at least as strong as it is right now?"" Vincent said.  But for now, the biggest problem facing Hydro Quebec is finding enough buildings and locations that are suitable to be used as mining farms, as well as hiring more people who can help meet all of the requests from these types of potential clients, as quickly as they are coming in.  ""[The miners] have this impression that they’re losing money every day, so they’re asking for big buildings with big interconnections and they want it tomorrow,"" Vincent said, concluding:  ""We have the capacity, but we’re not used to having so much big demand like this. It’s a good problem to have.""

42400847,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcL8gg,1515544424,Telegram's $1.2 Billion ICO Could Be the Most Ambitious Token Sale Yet,"To describe Telegram's planned initial coin offering (ICO) as ambitious would be an understatement.  And it's not only because the provider of a popular messaging app is seeking to raise $1.2 billion, according to three people familiar with the offering, which would represent the largest crypto token sale to date.  Nor is it just because Telegram, with 200 million users, seems to be intent on bringing cryptocurrency payments to the masses.  Rather, the proposed Telegram Open Network (TON) would seek nothing short of decentralizing online communication, with a suite of services, from file sharing to anonymous browsing, purchasable with the new crypto tokens, known as grams.  ""This is like Elon Musk-level ambition,"" Kyle Samani of Multicoin Capital, who looked at the offering, told CoinDesk. In fact, Samani said he declined to invest in the ICO precisely because of its broad scope.  ""My concern as an investor is focus and diluted effort,"" he said, since the TON aims to disrupt the same areas as several other blockchain startups that have also recently raised funds via token sales.  Outlined in a 23-page primer on the offering obtained by CoinDesk, the TON is a blockchain protocol for the peer-to-peer movement of funds between users and to make purchases. This would interact directly with Telegram's messenger app, which was created in 2013 at VK, the Russian equivalent of Facebook.  Sources told CoinDesk that $500 million to $600 million was Telegram's goal in a presale, with the other $600 million to $700 million to be offered publicly.  The company is using the Simple Agreement for Futures Tokens (SAFT) structure, in which money is raised from accredited investors before a functioning network is built, in order to avoid running afoul of securities laws. The grams, eventually delivered to the SAFT investors, could then be resold to consumers.  Talk of the town  Telegram, which has not responded to CoinDesk's requests for comment, would, no doubt, be the most mainstream company to issue a crypto token to date, although the social messaging app Kik raised $98 million in an ICO in September.  ""Many hedge fund managers are talking about the TON ICO,"" said BitBull Capital's Joe DiPasquale. ""Telegram has owned the chat space for those in crypto, and our usage of the app is increasing due to its security and ease. It's become the platform of choice for crypto discussion, and they will have a lot of attention leading into their ICO.""  Calling the presale's minimum investment of $1 million and cap on proceeds high and its one-year lockup long compared to other token sales before it, DiPasquale still continued optimistically, saying:  ""They are likely to be successful with a raise given their success as a platform to date.""  Other investors CoinDesk spoke with were reluctant to discuss the sale, with one citing a non-disclosure agreement required to view the primer and a technical white paper.  Rumors of the ICO plan started last week, and on Sunday a Russian-language slide deck marked ""Ton_Draft"" was posted on a Russian-language Telegram channel run by Fedor Skuratov, CEO of Combot, an analytics platform for the messaging app. TechCrunch was the first English language outlet to report the plan.  While the document CoinDesk received, and other investors have confirmed receiving, does not seem to be the most detailed account of the TON system (its footnotes refer to the technical white paper), the primer does provide a basic outline of what Telegram hopes to achieve with its crypto token.  Lofty goals  In the document, the company declares:  ""The current state of blockchain technology resembles automobile design in 1870: it is promising and praised by enthusiasts, but inefficient and too complicated to appeal to the mass consumer.""  As such, no cryptocurrency has gained truly mainstream success, yet Telegram believes, according to the paper, that a decentralized counterpart to everyday money is needed.  The primer states that the company is hoping to enable the easy exchange of micropayments among users and bots, something that's been of general interest throughout the blockchain space.  In an effort to do that, the primer explains that 5 billion grams will be generated, with 4 percent reserved for the Telegram team (with a four-year vesting period) and 44 percent to be sold during the ICO.  The remaining 52 percent will be ""retained by the TON Reserve to protect the nascent cryptocurrency from speculative trading and to maintain flexibility at the early stages of the evolution of the system,"" the primer states.  According to a source with knowledge of the presale terms, the one-year lockup comes with a 60 percent discount.  The ICO is likely all or a part of the ""three big announcements"" Telegram co-founder Pavel Durov told his followers about on his public Telegram channel on New Year's Eve.  According to the primer, the sale will take place in the first quarter of 2018, with the SAFTs converting to grams in the fourth quarter.  The roadmap goes on to state that the first related product, ""External Secure ID,"" will launch in the first quarter of 2018, with all other products to be rolled out by the first half of 2019. And the Telegram founders' control of the project will shift to a non-profit foundation by 2021.  'Tons' of competitors  While the TON's main priority is consumer payments, the primer goes into a number of services Telegram would like to build out that seem to encroach on territories, such as file sharing and privacy, already staked out by well-known and well-funded ICO issuers.  For instance, the primer outlines:  TON Storage – ""A distributed file-storage technology, accessible through the TON P2P Network and available for storing arbitrary files, with torrent-like access technology and smart contracts used to enforce availability."" Throwing in torrent-like access makes this product similar to the Filecoin platform, which raised $257 million in a token sale in September, as well as projects like Storj and Sia.  TON Proxy – ""This layer can be used to create decentralized VPN services and blockchain-based TOR alternatives to achieve anonymity and protect online privacy."" This sounds similar to the vision articulated by the team behind Orchid.  TON Services – ""A platform for third-party services of any kind that enables smartphone-like friendly interfaces for decentralized apps and smart contracts, as well as a World Wide Web-like decentralized browsing experience."" A number of blockchain-based startups are building decentralized app marketplaces, including Coinbase, which continues to build out its Toshi marketplace; and the recently completed token sale for Sirin, which seeks to integrate decentralized applications into its blockchain-based mobile device.  TON DNS – ""A service for assigning human-readable names to accounts, smart contracts, services and network nodes."" Both MaidSafe and Blockstack, which raised $50 million on an ICO in December, fall into the same category.  The company's ICO plans must have come together quickly, according to the former chief technical officer at VK, Anton Rozenberg.  ""While I was working at Telegram, cryptocurrencies, ICO, blockchain, etc were never discussed,"" Rozenberg, who left the company in April of last year, told CoinDesk.  Still, many remain, if nothing else, wow-ed by the expanse of the project.  Eduard Gurinovich, a Russian entrepreneur and founder of MyTime, which plans on launching an ICO in March, told CoinDesk:  ""Gram ... is declared, essentially, as a new dawn for P2P. This is something that could compete with bitcoin. Gram has the chance to realize its full potential. This is the winning bid for Gram as a new accounting currency, not an investing one.""
