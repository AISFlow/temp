Specifically, the conference will examine blockchain's impact on government activities, and will feature OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurría, the prime ministers of Serbia, Bermuda and the Republic of Mauritius and the State Secretary of Slovenia when it is held at the OECD headquarters in Paris on September 4 and 5. The forum is going to be livestreamed.  There will also be ""more than 400 senior decision-makers from the public and private sectors"" present at the meeting.  Attendees will discuss matters including the potential impact of blockchain on a global economy, privacy and cybersecurity, as well as how to use blockchain to enhance inclusiveness. They will also promote green growth, sustainability and strengthen governance and enforcement practices.  ""Blockchain has the potential to transform how a wide range of industries function. Fulfilling its potential, however, depends on the integrity of the processes and requires adequate policies and measures while addressing the risks of misuse. Governments and the international community will play a significant role in shaping policy and regulatory frameworks that are aligned with the emerging challenges and foster transparent, fair and stable markets as a basis for the use of blockchain,"" the news release says.  Earlier this summer, OECD's Directorate for Financial and Enterprise Competition Committee issued a paper titled ""Blockchain Technology and Competition Policy"" in preparation for the coming conference. The paper points at various applications of blockchain technology for governments and the private sector. It also explains the principles of blockchain and pays attention to consortia for building blockchain platforms, citing R3 as an example.  The paper mentions a number of use cases for the technology, including ""helping enforcers to clamp down on avoidance of tax and other laws and regulations; to support monetary and fiscal policy via sovereign-backed cryptocurrency; to create digital land titling and other registries, to help citizens prove their identity and vote, and to increase the efficiency and transparency of public services.""

However, the final version as of Monday now directs the Secretary of the Government Operations Agency to create a blockchain working group to study the technology instead.  It also adds that ""for the purpose of this chapter, 'blockchain' means a mathematically secured, chronological, and decentralized ledger or database,"" though this definition is temporary and will expire by January 2022.  The working group, whose chairperson will be designated no later than July 1, 2019, will include members from within the technology industry, as well as representatives from related fields. Stakeholders will be able to provide input to the group, which will then be responsible for recommending changes for the state legislature.  According to the bill, the group will specifically examine how blockchain can be used by the government and local businesses, what risks might come from using blockchain, how blockchain can benefit businesses and the government, how blockchain use can fit into California law and ""the best practices for enabling blockchain technology to benefit the State of California, California-based businesses and California residents.""  The group has until July 1, 2020 to draft its report, which ""shall include recommendations for modifications to the definition of blockchain ... and recommendations for amendments to other code sections that may be impacted by the deployment of blockchain.""

42401859,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2fqH,1535562034,Crypto Mining Attacks Soar in First Half of 2018,"Malicious crypto-mining attacks jumped 956 percent from the first half of 2017 to the first half of 2018, IT security firm Trend Micro reported Wednesday.  In its latest Midyear Security Roundup, Trend Micro researchers noted that there were more than 787,000 detections of malicious cryptocurrency mining software in the first six months of 2018, up from 74,500 detections across a similar period in 2017. The cryptojacking programs detected include both legitimate mining tools being misused and dedicated malware.  The report said that researchers also discovered ""47 new cryptocurrency mining malware families,"" meaning new groups began developing these programs this year, rather than just a few bad actors reusing the same malware.  Attackers have been increasingly looking into cryptojacking, or using businesses and other victims' computers to mine cryptocurrencies, the report said. This is a problem for businesses which now need to be aware of these potential threats.  The report explained:  ""From an enterprise point of view, the presence of unauthorized cryptocurrency miners in the network is a red flag not only for the affected individual user device but also for overall network security ... The new challenge for enterprises lies in the fact that cryptocurrency miners are less visible, more silent threats, the non-detection of which is likely to induce a false sense of security.""  Cryptojacking can damage hardware, resulting in shortened lifespans for businesses' computers and hurt network performance, the report added. Users' computers can also slow down, impacting their ability to use their machines as needed.  Some attackers are bypassing crypto-mining to instead hack exchanges directly, stealing large amounts of cryptocurrencies, the report said, citing this year's Coincheck and Coinsecure hacks as two examples.  ""Interestingly, these trends persisted even as the value of cryptocurrency itself declined throughout the first half of the year,"" the report noted.  Trend Micro's report follows specific instances of cryptojacking reported by various security researchers over the year. Last month, Kaspersky announced it had discovered a new form of cryptomining malware which targeted corporate networks specifically. Another researcher found a cryptojacker which used an exploit in the Drupal content management system.

42401856,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2fmL,1535558456,Origin Is Rolling Out a Decentralized Messaging App Built on Ethereum,"Origin Protocol, a blockchain project building a decentralized marketplace, has rolled out a peer-to-peer messaging application built on top of ethereum.  The project wrote in a blog post on Wednesday that the open-sourced messaging function is now up and running on its marketplace demo, creating an encrypted communication channel between buyers and sellers.  The technology works by utilizing users' ethereum addresses as a public ID for sending and receiving text messages, while the content itself is encrypted via users' private keys. However, the post adds, since the data will not be broadcast to the ethereum network, sending messages will not incur ""gas"" fees as normal transactions on ethereum would do.  Further, messages will be stored using the Interplanetary File System (IPFS), a technology that distributes data across a web of computers and can link to information on a blockchain.  Since a decentralized marketplace may experience disputes between buyers and sellers, the app adopts the ERC-725 standard, which links identity to a specific ethereum address and also allows a third-party arbitrator to audit conversation histories once granted permission by one of the participants.  Origin indicted that, besides sending text messages, it plans to extend the peer-to-peer communication tool to support multimedia content and machine-readable messages between decentralized applications.  The app launch comes after Origin raised $6 million via an initial coin offering in June.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, several other organizations have revealed plans to develop blockchain-based messaging applications, including cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and the U.S. Department of Defense.

The Mexico-based startup, which seeks to help individuals conduct transactions and bypass traditional banking services, revealed the news Wednesday, saying it will direct the funds toward growing its reach across various markets in South America. In particular, the firm intends to target residents of nations with troubled economies, according to a press release.  Berlin-based BlueYard Capital led the round, a spokesperson told CoinDesk, though they could not disclose the remaining investors.  AirTM co-founder and CEO Ruben Galindo said in the release that the company would continue to provide digital wallets and access to cryptocurrencies for individuals in the developing world.  According to a statement provided to CoinDesk, AirTM, for example, lets freelancers get paid in dollars directly to their AirTM wallet and then withdraw money as local currency. ""This is a much better solution than getting paid in devaluing currencies or via an e-wallet that is not connected to the freelancer's local bank network,"" it continued.  Citing growing ""distrust in financial and government institutions in many emerging markets"" AirTM said its peer-to-peer exchange is ""unique"" in allowing users to exchange local fiat currency for AirUSD, its U.S. dollar-denominated token.  The company announced earlier this year that it was working with zcash inventor Zooko Wilcox to support Venezuelan residents conducting transactions with zcash and U.S. dollars rather than the hyperinflated national currency, the bolivar (recently replaced by the sovereign bolivar).  The startup claims to allow Venezuelans to bypass banking services entirely, and provided services to potentially as many as 200,000 citizens at the time of the report. The company indicated that Venezuela was responsible for roughly 60,000 transactions per month as of April 2018.

The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) said on Wednesday that its research arm, Data61, is working with law firm Herbert Smith Freehills and IBM to conduct a pilot for a new platform called the Australian National Blockchain (ANB).  The technology is aimed to let businesses automate transactions based on pre-defined legal terms – designed to comply with Australian regulations – coded into smart contracts on top of an IBM-powered blockchain network.  The scheme will set up smart contracts that have the ability to record external data sources, such as from internet of things (IoT) devices, and can self-execute once specified conditions are met.  ""For example, construction site sensors could record the time and date of a delivery of a load on the blockchain and trigger a smart contract between the construction company and the bank that would automatically notify the bank that terms have been met to provide payment on that load delivery,"" the agency explained in the announcement.  The group said the pilot is expected to start by the end of 2018 and that it plans to invite regulators, banks, law firms and other businesses in the country to participate. Ultimately, it plans that Australian companies can join the network to harness its digitized contracts, swap data and confirm the authenticity and status of legal contracts.  The effort follows recent research conducted by Data61 in 2017, with research scientist Dr. Mark Staples saying that distributed ledger technology is a ""significant opportunity for Australia to create productivity benefits and drive local innovation.""

According to a news report from National Business Daily on Wednesday, the finance department of the Guangzhou Development District issued a notice to local businesses on Aug. 24, prohibiting them from hosting any crypto-related promotions or events.  The move comes just days after the government authority of Beijing's Chaoyang district issued a similar missive to shopping malls, hotels, restaurants and official buildings, as CoinDesk previously reported.  Citing a similar reason to that offered in Beijing, the Guangzhou agency said the goal of the restriction is to ""strengthen the position of Chinese yuan as the legal currency in China and to stabilize the country's financial system.""  Established by the State Council in the 1980s as one of the country's first special economic zones, the district was set out to be the hub for boosting economic and technological development in southern China.  While Guangzhou seeks to clamp down further on cryptocurrency, the government of Guangdong province, in which the city is situated, is taking the opposite stance.  Guangdong province published a notice on Tuesday, issued Aug. 14, that ordered municipal and county level governments to speed up the process of rolling out policies to support blockchain startups and accelerate the adoption of applications related to the tech.

42401860,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2foJ,1535540441,Binance Backs $32 Million Funding for Unicorn Founder's Crypto Stablecoin,"Yet another stablecoin is attracting big investors.  Announced Tuesday, the founder behind a $1.4 billion startup unicorn called TMON is revealing he has raised a $32 million seed round to build a stablecoin called Terra. But while a number of startups have deployed stablecoins – cryptocurrencies engineered to track the price of another asset, usually fiat currency – Terra comes with a notable addition: an existing user base.  Created by Korean entrepreneurs Danial Shin, who founded and chairs TMON, one of the top e-commerce websites in South Korea, the Terra project is launching with a significant number of partners that already reach 40 million customers. Those partners, who will together form the Terra Alliance, a group of e-commerce sites that are interested in incorporating the stablecoin into their business, include Woowa Brothers, Qoo10, Carousell, Pomelo and TIKI.  According to a spokesperson for the project, those companies, combined, take in $25 billion in sales.  ""We've banded together all the e-commerce platforms in Asia that are not called Alibaba or Amazon to push Terra into the hands of many many people,"" Shin told CoinDesk.  It's no wonder that the round includes quite a few notable crypto investors, including Polychain Capital, FBG Capital, Hashed, 1kx, Kenetic Capital, Arrington XRP, Binance Labs and others who were not disclosed.  ""We are pleased to support Terra, which sets itself apart from most other blockchain projects with its established and immediate go-to-market strategy,"" said Polychain's Karthik Raju in a statement.  Echoing that, Ella Zhang, head of Binance Labs, said in a statement:  ""While we see many stablecoins coming out, Terra's journey is especially meaningful as they are designing one of the few price-stable protocols with existing, working and strong go-to-market strategy and usage.""  That use, according to Shin, is in acting as an economical digital payment system, compared to credit cards.  He told CoinDesk, that a significant portion of TMON's annual losses take the form of credit card fees. And he's sure other retailers experience the same.  That said, if companies like his can lower transaction fees dramatically, he believes they stand a better chance against the industry giants.  For the new alliance of companies, ""the commitment really is that they will work together on a more efficient form of payment, obviously using blockchain technology,"" he continued.  A two-token system    To do that, the Terra protocol uses two tokens: terra and luna.      Investors in the seed round bought tokens from a pool of 400 million luna tokens (a fixed supply of one billion luna tokens will be created) set aside for them.      These luna tokens function as collateral on the network. Their sale will supply an initial reserve that will help stabilize the price versus fiat, much as Tether does now. The other token, terra, will act as the day-to-day payment method that consumers will use when the protocol goes live. It will be emitted as needed based on demand.      Then every time a transaction happens on the network, a tiny transaction fee will be paid to holders of Luna.      Shin told CoinDesk:      ""Luna is essentially a decentralized equity akin to Visa and Mastercard.""              He continued: ""What we've learned watching Visa and Mastercard stock prices every year, it's very smooth.""      Much like other stablecoin projects, oracles on the network will monitor supply and demand. As terra's use grows, it will algorithmically issue new tokens.      The advantage to e-commerce consumers and merchants will be that these new issuances will be used to provide discounts to people who use the crypto token. So, for example, if the protocol has issued a new lot of terra, merchants might be able to give consumers a 10 percent discount on purchases made with the token – that is until the new supply runs out.      ""As we integrate with more e-commerce partners, we are able to distribute that money back to e-commerce companies and their consumers in the form of kickbacks and discounts,"" Shin said.      In this way, the project seems focused on one of bitcoin's early touted use cases, as a cheaper digital payments rail as compared to the incumbents.      What Terra still needs, though, is a host blockchain – a big question for many projects today. The protocol will run on top of one of the existing projects; Shin said either ethereum, EOS, Orbs, messaging giant Kakao's Ground X or the forthcoming project from Upbit, one of Korea's exchanges.      But Shin doesn't seem phased by that, telling CoinDesk that even though the focus will first be on the Asian market, that's just the start of the project's aspirations.    ""We thought deploying the design in the U.S. where crypto adoption is very low, makes very little sense,"" Shin said, adding: ""I think the ambition is global.""

42401874,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2g43,1535540407,Bitcoin Cautiously Bullish as Price Faces New Hurdle,"Bitcoin (BTC) is looking north, having scaled $7,000 on Tuesday, but its close proximity to a key resistance zone and short-term overbought conditions call for caution on the part of the bulls.  The leading cryptocurrency jumped to a three-week high of $7,128 on Bitfinex yesterday and closed well above the 100-day moving average (MA) hurdle, signaling a continuation of the rally from the Aug. 14 low of $5,859.  However, the 21 percent price rise witnessed in the last two weeks is looking overstretched, as per the short-duration technical studies.  As a result, BTC may have a tough time scaling the immediate resistance zone of $7,160–$7,180 in the next 24 hours and could suffer a minor pullback before extending the ongoing rally.  At press time, BTC is changing hands at $7,100 – up 2.28 percent on the day.  Daily chart        As seen in the above chart, BTC's convincing move above $7,000 has bolstered the already bullish setup as indicated by the higher highs, ascending 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MAs), and the bullish crossover between 50-day and 100-day MAs.  The cryptocurrency has also found acceptance above $6,870 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from $8,507 to $5,859) and the relative strength index (RSI) has moved well above 50.00 (in bullish territory).  So, it seems safe to say that, for BTC, the path of least resistance is on the higher side, although a break above the resistance zone of $7,160 (top end or resistance of the rising wedge pattern)–$7,183 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement) could remain elusive for 24 hours or so.  4-hour chart  The RSI is located above 70.00, signaling overbought conditions. Hence, the immediate upside could be capped around $7,180 and a minor corrective pullback could be in the offing.  BTC/USD Longs  Another cause for caution is the 4.7 percent drop in the BTC/USD longs on Bitfinex yesterday, which indicates the break above $7,000 failed to entice the bulls. Moreover, it is the unwinding of shorts (drop in BTC/USD shorts), as seen in the chart above, that is likely driving BTC higher.  A rise in BTC/USD longs would add credence to the bullish view put forward by the daily chart.  View  The bull grip has strengthened, courtesy of BTC's convincing move above $7,000, although the immediate resistance at $7,160–$7,180 will likely prove a tough nut to crack in the next 24 hours.  A corrective pullback, if any, will likely be short-lived. Traders should watch out for a rebound from the ascending 5-day and 10-day MAs.  A move above $7,180 would open up upside toward the next major resistance at $7,330 (rising trendline seen in the daily chart).  The bears could feel emboldened if the rising wedge ends up with a downside break. That would mean the sell-off from the July high of $8,507 has resumed.

42401858,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2fpI,1535535010,Korean Crypto Exchange Bithumb to Restart User Registrations,"Bithumb, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea, is reportedly renewing its contract with the country's Nonghyup Bank – a move that will allow the firm to once more accept new account registrations.  Korean news agency Yonhap reports on Wednesday that Bithumb and Nonghyup are planning to sign the contract on Aug. 30 in order to allow the exchange to assign new so-called real-name virtual accounts to cryptocurrency traders.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, Bithumb announced the suspension of its new account registration service on July 31, putting it down to a ""service improvement process."" Reports at the time suggested the halt was forced upon the exchange because the bank was insisting on changes following the exchange's $31 million hack in June.  Currently, banks in South Korea can provide account services for crypto exchanges to deposit users' assets on their behalf. However, each virtual account dedicated to a specific user within the exchange's deposit account must be paired with the user's verified identity so that banks can monitor the flow of the funds for anti-money laundering purposes.  Under the country's regulations, users' accounts must also be separated from company accounts that, for instance, store an exchange's own operating funds.  Following the July suspension note, 24-hour trading volume on Bithumb took a hit and dropped by 40 percent within just three days, from around $350 million on July 31 to $200 million on Aug. 3.  Daily trading volume further declined to around $71.7 million by Aug. 23, but had rebounded to over $344 million at press time, data from CoinMarketCap shows.

42401868,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2fy9,1535529607,Tron Now Owns a Stake In BitTorrent Founder's New Crypto Project,"When BitTorrent sold to the founder of controversial crypto startup Tron, it wasn't just one of web 2.0's earliest and most prestigious startups that changed hands.  It turns out, the peer-to-peer sharing company now owned by Tron founder Justin Sun also took a small stake in Chia Network, a soon-to-be-launched cryptocurrency protocol helmed by BitTorrent co-founder Bram Cohen, a fact that was not been previously disclosed by either firm.  According to documents obtained by CoinDesk, Sun submitted his winning acquisition offer to the BitTorrent Board on February 14. The next day, the board unanimously approved an agreement with Cohen granting a ""full release"" of some of its intellectual property (IP) in exchange for the right to make a $50,000 investment in the company under a Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE).  As for what IP might have changed hands, and that might be helping to power the Chia network, both companies are now staying silent on the matter.  A spokesperson for Chia Network told CoinDesk:  ""There has been no license or assignment of rights from BitTorrent to Bram [Cohen] or Chia. All software and related intellectual property rights used internally or distributed by Chia was either developed by Chia employees or contractors, licensed from third parties or was available in the public domain. Chia has committed to open source.""  Sources with knowledge of the deal said the two companies further entered into an agreement of ""mutual releases and non-disparagement,"" so that neither party would bring suit against the other due to events that happened prior to the investment.  All in all, it's the latest information on Sun's surprise acquisition of BitTorrent, first reported by Variety in June, and which subsequently prompted no shortage of dialogue and confusion in the industry.  In July, BitTorrent announced it would operate from Tron's San Francisco offices.  Cohen's role  While Cohen remained on BitTorrent's board, he left to start Chia in late 2017.  According to the merger documents, Cohen still owned 31 percent of BitTorrent's common stock at the time of the acquisition. Common stock holders received $29,343,986 of the $119 million sale. Each share of common stock was worth a base price per share (with various conditions) of roughly $0.81.  By the time of the sale, Cohen's attention was primarily directed at the new venture.  Chia Network is a more eco-friendly way of securing a public blockchain, as CoinDesk previously reported in September. Miners on the network prove that a certain amount of disk space is available to the network. Validators on the network turn over unused disk space for Chia's use, according to its FAQ.  In March, it announced a $3.395 million funding round led by Naval Ravikant, which also included Andreessen Horowitz, True Ventures, MetaStable, Greylock Partners, Danhua Capital and DCM.  DCM was also the leading shareholder in BitTorrent.  At that time, the company said it would do what's known as a ""mini-IPO"" under the Security and Exchange Commission's Reg A+. The round was promised in the second quarter, but it has not yet been publicly announced. Many of BitTorrent's patentable inventions list Cohen as the inventor.  Google Patents lists six patents with Cohen as the inventor, the oldest being ""End-system dynamic rate limiting of background traffic."" All of the patents he's credited with still show up as assigned to BitTorrent.  Internal BitTorrent documents reveal that early on Sun wanted Cohen and other early staff to return, but removed that requirement as a stipulation of the deal.  BitTorrent did not reply to a request for comment by press time.

The system will record applications submitted by farmers, who compete for a limited number of commercial plots. Some 2,736 trading spots are up for grabs, with the market season stretching between April 20 and November 25 and farmers coming in from Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.  As might be expected, there's a push to get a spot, with some 20,000 applicants submitting their bids each year. The idea is to use ethereum as a way to create an immutable record of applications, with updates made for those who are either approved or denied access, according to Andrey Borodyonkov, who serves as the blockchain product manager for Moscow City Hall.  ""Blockchain is an additional guarantee that the incoming applications remain immutable as well as makes the audit of the application history possible,"" he explained to CoinDesk.  Moscow's government detailed in a statement:  ""The entire dataset is publicly viewable, transparent and available for download. In that case, submission time can be confirmed, while the application cannot be deleted or altered by someone once it is submitted.""  Part of the problem is that many of the farmers are unhappy with the current system for reviewing applications.  Andrey Belozerov, the strategy and innovations advisor to Moscow City Hall's CIO, expressed hope that the new system will help alleviate some of the concerns by making that information more publicly accessible.  ""We believe that farmers should have a transparent system to see why their application is declined or approved,"" he said in the press release. ""Blockchain is to make sure that the process is fully transparent and no one can alter an application. We hope that blockchain will provide full transparency for everyone.""  The Moscow City Hall started hiring developers capable of working with blockchain back in 2016, Andrei Borodyonkov told CoinDesk, and in 2018 that staff officially formed a new division named ""Product Blockchain.""
